I have studied medicine, and I\u2019ve been working part time in various jobs as I was preparing for the board exams for the country I am residing in, in order to register my licence here. I am married, and my husband earns an average salary, but we have always helped each other out financially when the other is in a tight spot. During this time, most of my income went towards rent, bills, and groceries. I haven\u2019t been shopping for myself in ages. \n\nI passed the board exams about 5 months ago. I had a very slow start as I was new, with a small number of patients. Most months, I was earning the same amount I was making at my previous retail job! I started building my books, and just this month, I finally earned a decent amount (much more than I had ever previously earned). \nBefore getting paid, I had SHOWN my husband my invoices for the month hi in order to help him feel less anxious about our finances, especially with a baby on the way. \n\nAs soon as I was paid, I put a portion of it into our joint savings account, and then I transferred him money to pay back a loan we owed. Afterwards, I went to a maternity store and bought myself 3 pairs of maternity pants and a maternity dress I had been eyeing for more than a month, but had not been able to afford up until that point. I should mention that this store isn\u2019t the cheapest store, but they specialise in maternity clothes and have some good quality items. \n\nWhen I got home, I happily showed him what I had bought. Instead of showing any normal reaction, he shook his head, said something hurtful about how I was irresponsible for spending that amount of money on clothes when we have a baby to worry about, and just left the room. \n\nI was left in shock at how he spoke to me and reacted. For me, finally being able to afford something nice for myself with my own money, after spending so much effort in registering myself as a doctor in this country, was a moment of happiness and relief. Instead, he made me feel as though I had done something terrible. I thought he would be proud of me for finally making some decent money after making peanuts over the last two years. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance to say anything, he just walked out of the room and now hasn\u2019t spoken to me in 3 days. \n\nI genuinely thought that he would realise by now that I have done nothing wrong, and would apologise. I sent him a long message explaining to him that why the way he treated me was so unfair, that I did nothing wrong by getting myself some quality clothes for my pregnancy with my own money, and that was not going to make us go broke. Today when I got home, he asked me how I am. Because I was so hurt by his lack of effort in trying to make things better, I simply relied \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d and walked into the bathroom.

Do you want your child thinking the silent treatment MANIPULATION TACTIC is OKAY to do to a partner, someone they LOVE?  Because that is what your future child is going to do. Children model the behavior of their parents, and will naturally think the shittiest behavior is NORMAL and GOOD. When a parent is being abusive to a partner,  kids pick that up and use it as a model for their own behavior. \n\nThis behavior is NOT OKAY, and I would NOT want my child growing up seeing this behavior from a parent.", "NTA, but i would take a long hard look at this relationship. I know roommates who have better communication and support. You shouldn't be taking 'loans' from your partner. The whole idea is supporting one another in your partnership. If you were to leave him, he should as hell would ask for spousal support.", "NTA, this sounds like it could be the beginning of fiscal abuse or something.", "NTA. At six months you NEED mat pants. If you're spending a bit more it's fine (especially if you plan on more children) I wore the same ones for all three pregnancies and by the end even the pricey ones were rags. If they do hold up resell them when you're done. \n\nYou are in the right but if your hubby is not normally this weird about things maybe ask to sit down and listen to why he was so upset but this ? This feels like it goes beyond one splurge. Also keep in mind when we are pregnant we are way more sensitive to criticism (not saying that was the situation but in my experience my husband would say something and I would Interpret it the worst possible way). \n\nI am reading this as a low key hubby freak out about not being able to provide for your LO and instead of logically saying that he's getting snarky. That might just be me as my hubby was terrified of the idea of being the sole provider even though my gov does mat leave. \n Enjoy your lovely pants and good luck on your little one. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Nta \nYou earned these pants you need pants to wear, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nI wonder what his expectations are of the money that you earn.

I think your husband is behaving ridiculously. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You need maternity clothes not just because they are more comfortable but also because they allow you to look more professional in your job.  I can't imagine many people wanting to see someone who looks like they don't know how to dress professionally. \n\nYour husband seems quite clueless about pregnancy, your comfort, and your need to dress professionally. As a result, he probably doesn't realize how hurtful his comments were.\n\nThat you're still hurt by his lack of an apology risks the development of resentment on your part. That's not healthy.  Sooner rather than later, you may need to have a clear the air conversation with him.  Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy.", "NTA. He has absolutely no right to question you or complain to you about how you spend your *own* money. You put a portion of your paycheck into the joint account, which he does have say over, and gave him some money for a loan both of you owe, again which he has a say over. And if he's so worried about this baby that's making its appearance in the next 3 months, he should realize that you need *some* kind of clothing to fit over your growing baby bump. What does he expect you to do, borrow his clothes (assuming they'd be at least somewhat roomier for you than your non-maternity stuff)? Shop at used-clothing stores? What's going to happen when the baby actually comes? Will he be complaining about what kind of baby food or diapers (nappies) you buy?", "NTA. You're a freaking *doctor* and he doesn't want you to have pants? That's a shitty way to treat a spouse, especially one growing a jointly created human being. Ask yourself why you are allowing this kind of treatment and how long you are willing to endure it", "Definitely NTA. First, I\u2019m so proud of you for becoming a doctor. Second, you earned that money yourself! You have every right to spend it how you want. Also, having to buy (not excessively or anything) maternity clothes is pretty much a given when pregnant. Your husband is so in the wrong here. I hope your success in the professional world continues to blossom.", "NTA  \n1. You NEED maternity clothes  \n2. Congratulations on becoming a Doctor  \n3. His attitude is perplexing. Is he jealous of you becoming a Doctor?  \n4. Things won't get better unless you sit down and tell him how you're feeling over all of this", "NTA unless you spent an unreasonable amount of money on those clothes (3 pregnancies, so yes those clothes come with a very short expiration date) I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t treat yourself of something you also actually need.", "NTA \n\nBut asking for INFO here, does your husband refuse to spend $$ on things he needs using personal money? Is he holding on to the rags and remains of his items)/clothes? whats going on with him lol", "NTA\n\n\nYou should be honest about how you are though. He is refusing to communicate but it would be smart to not say fine but simply \"still hurt\" or \"still confused\".", "NTA NTA NTA. do not ever blame yourself. you\u2019re supporting your family, carrying a whole-ass child, and have just gotten a pay-rise. you deserve to get yourself something", "NTA. Your husband, though\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re supposed to wear to work if you don\u2019t have maternity clothes. It sounds like he\u2019s having trouble with the fact you\u2019re going to be making more money than he does.

You deserve to be as comfortable as you can be.", "What did he want you to wear lol", "NTA- you need to look professional in order to work.", "NTA for buying maternity clothes, you\u2019re pregnant and you need clothes to fit around your growing bump. \n\nHowever you are  definitely not in the right and this probably does make you a AH for walking away when he came to speak to you, especially after you messaged him saying how you felt and that he wasn\u2019t trying to make the situation better.

In the end it's not about being right or wrong as much as it is about talking it through and coming to a resolution that both people feel good with.

She needs to get out for her own sanity, and now before he can come after her for alimony. She's only been a doctor for 5 months and she's already making more than her previous job. She needs to protect herself, her child, and her assets from this man.", "Not that this is in anyway the core issue, but the maternity clothing is a good business expense too.

It\u2019s very important for a physician to be dressed professionally.", "NAH - I think husband is still worried about money, and it was a knee jerk reaction.

I think you both have been so worried over money while you were getting licensed it was a reaction.  Talk it out!", "NTA. You need maternity clothes. He's never going to know what it's like to fit into your regular cloths of Friday but be thankful you bought those maternity clothes on Monday. It happened to my sister. In the space of a weekend she could no long zip up her regular pants.", "NTA.  You are a professional and your clothing needs to reflect that.  I remember buying 1 dress, a couple of pair of maternity pants and several tops, and while they were fine, I sure got tired of them after wearing them for months.  Enjoy your new clothes and I hope your husband grows up before you have the baby.", "What's his is his, and what's yours is his too when you're earning more than him, huh?\n\nNTA. You were literally spending money on accommodating your baby. His need for control over your clothes and income is disturbing.", "NTA. I've never been pregnant.

NTA", "NTA sounds like he hasn't given any thought at all to you, your professional needs (having nice clothes for the office is essential) or the physical work you are doing bringing this baby into the world.\n\nDon't tell him you're fine. Tell him you're still hurt and you deserve an apology.\n\n(is it possible he's feeling jealous/upset at your earning potential suddenly being higher than his?)", "NTA\n\nHe is\n\nYou even bought yourself stuff for the pregnancy. That\u2019s honestly not a gift for yourself. I remember being pregnant, it feels less guilty cause you\u2019re essentially a vessel for a while - everything done for you is in the interest of baby. So now you look cute as a pregnant woman. It\u2019s awesome, but hardly even selfish! It\u2019s the least you can do for yourself with all that hardwork and sacrifice PLUS feeling like a physical oven appliance through it for nine months.\n\nHe\u2019s absolutely TA for his reaction. I get he\u2019s concerned about money and a baby, that part of the stereotypical (socially constructed I mean) male pregnancy experience. Hopefully he calms down and talks about it like a big boy. He is going to be a father soon\u2026share a kid, might as well start sharing your burdens too, mental, financial, or otherwise, and be a team here\u2026", "INFO: How much did you spend?", "It sounds as though he has a lot of financial anxiety but his reaction is OTT and damaging. Pregnant women need maternity clothes, especially when working in professional settings."]}
