The other boys feel uncomfortable. For example they were watching some scary movie and he said he needed to take a \"brain break\" and went home and never came back. \n\n The 9yo Cashin boy is very talkative and affectionate. The other day he kissed my 9yo on the lips while they were building Legos in front of other kids.. My son nearly gagged. That alone got him blacklisted from the other kids in the neighborhood. \n\nSo now my 13yo and 9yo don't want to hang out with them. That really hurt the Cashin kids and their dad asked me if I knew what was going on. I said bro, I'm going to be honest. Your kids are socially inept. My kids really tried with your kids. They don't want to hangout with your kids because they don't want them to get bullied by other kids in their social group. I told him I really really like his kids. But they just don't fit in. My kids can't fix that. \n\nHe was very offended and said not to worry because they won't hangout with my kids including their 6yo. I said my 6yo and your 6yo get along.

Part of education is social and emotional skills, and if the parents aren't getting their kids into social settings on a regular basis, they're doing them a disservice because social skills cannot be learned when not practiced. \n\n2) However, not liking horror movies and being affectionate are not \"socially inept.\" Kissing a kid without consent is not okay and needs to be talked about, but leaving a horror movie midway through is listening to your own mind/body's needs. Many of us do not like horror films, and it is wise af to walk out of a situation that is harming you. This kid was AWESOME! He didn't judge the other kids or force them to stop watching or beg them to do something else. He just removed himself from a situation that was hurting him. He told the kids he needed a \"brain break,\" which is a common term in public schools as well. He didn't walk out without saying anything or throw a fit. I think he handled himself wonderfully! And you've told your son it's alright to ostracize him for that. You are teaching your kid that it's wrong to discern his own needs and meet them in a way that doesn't harm others. \n\nYou are siding with bullies instead of teaching your kids empathy and inclusion.

He could be just hanging with your kids to appease his parents or brothers (i.e. Mom and dad send him over because he can't let sibs go alone, or mom and dad want him to get socialized more, and point at your house). Me and some friends went through this in middle school with one ex-friend. He would come over, and even ask to sleep over, and then make excuses to leave, and call his parents to pick him up, even at 12 am. He eventually started hanging with another group, and haven't heard from or about him in over 20 years.\n\n9 year old needs to be talked to. Your son was uncomfortable, and you are NTA for this. Affection, and kissing can be two different things. This kid might have trouble reading social cues, about when someone likes them as more than a friend or not.", "Jeez, the comments are split. NTA for the situation, but really, the only thing that keeps you from being an AH is the kissing thing. That to me is a big, BIG no.", "YTA.
