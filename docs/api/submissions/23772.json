I'm more than happy to have as many kids at our house. I don't care if they eat all my food or are loud. My 13 and 9 year old have grown cold of the 13 and 9yo Cashin boys. Their socially awkward because they do not interact with kids their own age enough so they come off as weird. \n\nA lot of the stuff my 13yo and his friends talk about go over the 13yo Cashin boy's head so he just sits there in silence. The other boys feel uncomfortable. For example they were watching some scary movie and he said he needed to take a \"brain break\" and went home and never came back. \n\n The 9yo Cashin boy is very talkative and affectionate. The other day he kissed my 9yo on the lips while they were building Legos in front of other kids.. My son nearly gagged. That alone got him blacklisted from the other kids in the neighborhood. \n\nSo now my 13yo and 9yo don't want to hang out with them. That really hurt the Cashin kids and their dad asked me if I knew what was going on. I said bro, I'm going to be honest. Your kids are socially inept. My kids really tried with your kids. They don't want to hangout with your kids because they don't want them to get bullied by other kids in their social group. I told him I really really like his kids. But they just don't fit in. My kids can't fix that. \n\nHe was very offended and said not to worry because they won't hangout with my kids including their 6yo. I said my 6yo and your 6yo get along. You can give them a ball and they will play for hours.

Yikes!", "ESH except the kids.\n\n1) The parents need to prepare their kids to live in the real world, not whatever odd delusion of a world they think they can create by overly sheltering their kids. Part of education is social and emotional skills, and if the parents aren't getting their kids into social settings on a regular basis, they're doing them a disservice because social skills cannot be learned when not practiced. \n\n2) However, not liking horror movies and being affectionate are not \"socially inept.\" Kissing a kid without consent is not okay and needs to be talked about, but leaving a horror movie midway through is listening to your own mind/body's needs. Many of us do not like horror films, and it is wise af to walk out of a situation that is harming you. This kid was AWESOME! He didn't judge the other kids or force them to stop watching or beg them to do something else. He just removed himself from a situation that was hurting him. He told the kids he needed a \"brain break,\" which is a common term in public schools as well. He didn't walk out without saying anything or throw a fit. I think he handled himself wonderfully! And you've told your son it's alright to ostracize him for that. You are teaching your kid that it's wrong to discern his own needs and meet them in a way that doesn't harm others. \n\nYou are siding with bullies instead of teaching your kids empathy and inclusion. A lack of empathy is its own kind of social ineptitude. Be more considerate.", "I love the posts where people ask if they are the A H then argue with everyone when they say yes they are. YTA dude.

The comment would have been understandable if the actions of the kids were more extreme, but no one got hurt and other than the kid kissing yours, all events seem very tame. \n\nIt would have been better for you to explain to that dad the events that were going on as the reason why his kids were being excluded, and maybe make a positive suggestion even if you don't want to force your kids to play with them. This would have made him realize that his kids may need more social interaction without insulting anyone needlessly.", "YTA\n\nI said NTA at first, but then finished reading all the comments and was not impressed with some the OP comments, mainly the tone and the indignation towards other posters.\n\nIt's hard to tell from just a few posts from someone on the internet, but I'm getting an AH vibe here, not all kids are at the same level socially and treating awkward kids with contempt is not the best solution.", "Of course YTA.  It\u2019s ok to be honest, but it\u2019s important to remember that it is your honest *opinion*.  It\u2019s not a matter of fact.  You aren\u2019t being kind, you are being condescending.  \n\nThe kids may very well be socially inept.  But, you didn\u2019t exactly put your superior social skills on display in this situation.", "YTA. While it's understandable that you want to be honest with your neighbor, telling the dad that his kids are socially inept was not the most compassionate approach. Labeling children in such a negative way can be hurtful and damaging to their self-esteem.  \nInstead of using harsh language, you could have expressed your concerns more tactfully. You could have shared that there have been some challenges in social interactions between the kids and discussed possible ways to help them improve their social skills. Encouraging playdates with a mix of different kids, including those from their own age group, could have been a helpful suggestion.  \nRemember, kids develop social skills at their own pace, and being understanding and supportive can make a significant difference in their growth. It's essential to be kind and empathetic when discussing sensitive matters like this with others, especially when it involves children's feelings.", "ESH. Based on your comments, you\u2019re an ass and allowing your 13 year old to bully/alienate the other 13 yo kid because he needed a brain break aka time away from a scary ass movie??? Some people don\u2019t like them especially at 13 years old. \n\n9 year old should also be taught consent, boundaries, etc., by the dad for sure. I completely understand that.

Your oldest kids sound like they did try to include them but they reached their limit. Plus, it doesn't sound like you were the one that wanted to break up the youngest 6 y/o kids from hanging out. \n\nProbably tough for the Cashin father to hear but the onus isn't on your kids to be their social guide", "Info.

Maybe a soft YTA for your delivery, but your kids have a right not to hang out with people that make them uncomfortable and he has a right to make parenting decisions.\n\nKids who are homeschooled really need other social systems (sports, library clubs, church groups, etc so they do develop socially more normally).", "YTA for bullying a 13 year old and calling their behaviour a dick cause they left during a horror movie you deemed \"not scary enough\" and that they didn't come back. maybe he intended to come back but couldn't face it (honestly reading your responses, i wouldn't blame him) and couldn't come back. he wasn't being a dick, he was a teenager frightened. you're mocking a child and somehow think you're a better person.", "YTA.

This happens to kids growing up. Its natural), and is starting to cut time spent with your kids short. He could be just hanging with your kids to appease his parents or brothers (i.e. Mom and dad send him over because he can't let sibs go alone, or mom and dad want him to get socialized more, and point at your house). Me and some friends went through this in middle school with one ex-friend. He would come over, and even ask to sleep over, and then make excuses to leave, and call his parents to pick him up, even at 12 am. He eventually started hanging with another group, and haven't heard from or about him in over 20 years.\n\n9 year old needs to be talked to. Your son was uncomfortable, and you are NTA for this.

I hated not being able to relate to other children and it\u2019s the reason I have major social anxiety as an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that this father is failing his children. It\u2019s unfortunate but they are learning the hard way that behaviour that is socially acceptable at home (kissing family on the mouth) is not always acceptable with others and may even be unwelcome. \n\nHomeschooling is a terrible affliction on children IMO and you\u2019re not the asshole for pointing that out to this parent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
