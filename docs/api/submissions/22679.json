As someone who has a 4 year old and a baby, divorce that man and get full custody. He should be no where near those children which it seems he\u2019s doing already.

Divorce him as hard as you possibly can.", "NTA. This sounds like an extremely dangerous situation. You\u2019ve done the right thing and I would definitely not trust him with your children. Hope the rash clears up poor Bubba!", "NTA. Get a divorce attorney immediately.", "NTA. As someone who works with kids, so many things could happen to your children if they are left alone. This is a marriage ending decision for me", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019d be an instant divorce filing for me. Total and complete dealbreaker. Protect both children (from the neglect, the bum rash, and the lying-for-reward already instilled in the 4yo).", "NTA- you should called the police on him for neglect and endangering your children !", "NTA. He neglects the kids, lied about it, clearly isn't trying to get a job.

If he'll leave them at home alone at that age and bribe the 4yo not to say anything.... this only gets worse. \n\nHonestly, I'd have considered calling the law for child abandonment,  but that would trickle down on all of you", "NTA> I am so sorry you have to go through treatment like this.

Why have you not pressed charges against him for child endangerment; you're very lucky nothing worse happened to your children.

If you let this ever happen again and the unthinkable occurs you will absolutely never forgive yourself. Nta", "NTA. He is extremely lucky nothing worse than diaper rash has happened. Make sure you back up that footage (all of it) to several different places. Show it to the divorce attorney and go for full custody.
