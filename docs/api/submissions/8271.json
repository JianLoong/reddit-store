While planning the wedding it has come up a few times on whether or not my fianc\u00e9s sister 24 F \u201cK\u201d will be invited or not. I do not want her there. She has hated me from the first day she knew me she didn\u2019t make it known at first but she did little things to try and ruin the relationship between my fianc\u00e9 and I she constantly lies, accuses me of saying or doing mean things to her when no one else was around. One of the biggest lies she has told is that I supposedly told her privately that my fianc\u00e9 is actually gay and is using me as a cover. She told everyone she could that I said this, his friends, their aunts/uncles and their parents. This happened in the first two months of us dating so it caused a big misunderstanding and he was quite upset but my fianc\u00e9 quickly realized the pattern of her being dishonest and no longer believes anything she said about me. \n\nOnce she realized she couldn\u2019t get to my fianc\u00e9 she switched sides and started talking badly about him to me, trying to turn me against him and convince me that he was a bad person. It didn\u2019t work and that frustrated her and directed her anger back at me. Her parents are major enablers. My fianc\u00e9 has always stood up for me in situations where she is badmouthing me but still tries to stay cordial with K because he doesn\u2019t want to cause a problem with his parents. They have and always will take her side. She also throws fits if she doesn\u2019t get her way she will full on scream at the top of her lungs throw things and cry. \n  \nRecently she told a lie that I cannot forgive, it was something that a normal person would not and should not ever lie about. I had to take her accusation with a grain of salt and when I got to the bottom of it I found out it wasn\u2019t the first time she had lied about something so incredibly serious. I have been so patient for years, I have forgiven and moved on for years and frankly I\u2019m tired of it, I don\u2019t think she should be included in a day that celebrates a relationship she has done nothing but try to destroy. \n\nYesterday my fianc\u00e9s mom mentioned something about K wanting to be the maid of honor in our wedding, I told her that was not happening and she pressed until I finally told her that I am not even sure I want K at the wedding at all. She lost her mind saying I\u2019m immature and rude later in the day her husband pulled me aside and told me I can\u2019t say things like that because he knows I don\u2019t mean them and it only upsets people. I assured him I did mean it and he shared the same sentiment as his wife, \n My fianc\u00e9 stood by my side in this situation his parents and K are very mad at both of us. I don\u2019t have friends or family to talk to about this situation I\u2019d like some outside opinions AITA for not wanting K there?", "created_utc": 1674673458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l6n5v/aita_for_not_wanting_my_future_sil_at_my_wedding/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A viperious liar is dangerous.  She can and very well might destroy lives, and unless she gets help and changes, should not be included in your lives.\n\nPlus, keeping her away from the wedding might be one of the first times she has had consequences for her bad behaviour.  That is a gift to her because she might realize she stands to lose a lot if she persists in this.\n\nWhat MIL and FIL want should not change your minds.", "The way it\u2019s looking? Have a destination elopement and bypass family drama altogether. Barring that\u2026 it sounds like their family members are going to destroy the wedding by drama whether you include her if not.  Do private and just have the reception be afterwards where there will be less of a magnifying glass on who is represented. \n\nNTA times a thousand. She and her toxic enabling family are TAs.  Good luck.", "Nope NTA but you should have let your fiance handle this. Or yall talked and decided ahead of time together then approached it. Need to decide how important having his parents at the wedding will be, too, since sounds like excluding her will cause a rift with them. I wouldn't want her there either personally so I get your side of it completely. Just not the best approach maybe.", "NTA. Talk to your fianc\u00e9 though. This sounds like it might blow up his relationship with his family, so just make sure he\u2019s on board with that. Sounds like he\u2019s got your back :)\n\nFuture SIL is delusional to think she\u2019d be MOH after all she\u2019s done, and the parents are gross for enabling that behavior in an adult. Let the bridge burn, good riddance.", "This is why I always look at family dynamics when it comes to a potential partner...Drama. It can't be helped sometimes I know but If I had the say so, I wouldn't have gotten involved period. Maybe that's why I'm single LMAO. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, you're NTA. clearly your SIL is toxic and during the day of your celebration, it's meant to be celebrated with you two in mind, not your SIL. Also, kudos to your fianc\u00e9 for sticking up for you. Still, please acknowledge to him that it probably wasn't easy for him to do that since it is involving HIS family.", "NTA.\n\nIt's abundantly clear \"K\" will find ways to ruin your wedding if she attends. She will likely find ways to ruin it even without being there, but she definitely sounds like a person who should not attend.\n\nYour future husband is very likely going to stand his ground as it would appear that this now can cause a major rift and so him standing your common ground as a new family will be rather important. Sadly we cannot pick our biological families but we can chose to selectively exclude certain family members from our lives if they are as toxic as \"K\" seems to be.", "NTA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your wedding. If you and your husband don\u2019t want her there then that\u2019s completely up to you but there\u2019s always going to be family who disagree with your decision. When your in laws continue to ask why you\u2019re not inviting her be sure to be honest with them about how hurtful she has been to you and your fianc\u00e9e over the years. Ultimately, what really matters is that you and your future husband stay on the same page regarding this matter.", "NTA, but what kind of relationship do you want to have with his parents? Sometimes you invite family not for your relationship with the invitee, but out of respect for your parents and the relationship you have with them. \n\nOnce you acknowledge that to yourself,  then you can fall back on ice cold manners and etiquette to get through the moments you have to actually talk to her (reception line would be it). Make sure she's sat at the same table with her parents and let your wedding planner know to keep an eye on her to immediately shut down any disruption,  if you fear something like that. Make sure your besties are prepared to do damage control (\"oh,  that's his sister. No one has a clue why she's so bitter,  but the bride didn't want to upset her new mil by excluding her. )", "NTA- I totally understand why you don't want her there. \nOnly thing I guess is what your fianc\u00e9 wants, it is his sister after all.\nTalk to him and ignore the rest of the family.", "INFO: what does your fianc\u00e9 want to do about inviting K?", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules. \n\nWhy the heck would you want someone who is constantly trying to stir the pot at your wedding? They'd probably just cause a scene if they showed up. Please hire security for your wedding.", "NTA - It\u2019s your wedding and you are free to exclude whoever you want. Especially someone who has been horrible too you. Make sure to setup passwords with all your vendors so that she cannot cancel anything. Also make sure the venue knows she is not invited and to not let her in.", "NTA. You and your fianc\u00e9 both don't want her there, so you are free to not invite her. That said, you'll likely alienate his parents and cause issues with them, but that's something your fianc\u00e9 needs to decide.", "NTA - why involve someone who will ruin the day. Spend the wedding money on the honeymoon.", "NTA. But this is gonna be a continuing issue and you and your fianc\u00e9 MUST be on the same page about it. Sounds like your future SIL is unhinged. She needs help. If she\u2019s not getting help and is being coddled by her parents, it\u2019s likely to get to a point where your fianc\u00e9 will also need to step away from his sister and anyone who excuses such horrible behavior. \n\nIn law shit is so messy and it\u2019ll stay with you for decades. Do you want to live like this? Does your fianc\u00e9? How does something like this get resolved?

And you can\u2019t expect him to completely cut her off unless he wants to. Don\u2019t assume he will do that.\n\n\nBut yeah - I\u2019m more concerned about the lifelong commitment and issues you\u2019ll have with the in laws moreso than the wedding itself. And I wonder why you\u2019re more concerned about this one day than the problem of having such a SIL for life.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough situation. I hope it gets better for everyone involved very soon.", "INFO: on a scale of 1-10, how likely is she to try to hijack the wedding for attention? Wearing a white dress ? Announcing an engagement or a pregnancy? Having a medical emergency? Real or fake? \n\nThis is just food for your thoughts.\n\n\nSomeone else has mentioned elopement, you really should consider the option; especially if you don't want a big wedding to begin with.", "DO NOT INVITE HER. She will turn up in white, cause a scene, ruin your wedding.  And imagine when you have children.  She will be spreading lies that will have CPS involved.  Cut her off now. Even the parents if you have to. Major red flags. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe is an extremely toxic person and will do nothing but destroy your wedding day. If his parents can't get on board with your boundaries then they should be uninvited as well.", "NTA \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 need to have a long talk about her. He is NOT obligated to love K because they share parents or have her in his life. I think she would ruin your wedding TBH.", "NTA.  Sounds like it's time for K to receive a full helping of consequences.  But keep in mind, just because you don't invite her, doesn't mean she won't show up and try to create a scene.  OP and fiance need to have a plan in case this happens.", "Does fiance want her there? If he really does then YTA. She doesn't like you, not there for you. She's there for her brother. Happens all the,  time someone goes to a wedding just to support one person.\n\nNow maid of honor yes non starter but if fiance wants his sister there, just respect it.

Absolutely no information she could use to harm you. \n\nI would give the parents two choices: they record statements that their daughter has made false and slanderous accusations against their son and has admitted they are lies, and they get to maintain low contact, with the understanding that the moment they share any information with her they\u2019re also permanently no contact. Or they can admit to accepting criminal behavior from their daughter against their son and go no contact immediately. \n\nThis isn\u2019t family drama.
