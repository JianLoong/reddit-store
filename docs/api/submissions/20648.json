I get severe vertigo, nausea, hyper sensitive smell as well as photophobia, you were just trying to give him a little insight into something you deal with multiple times a week.", "NTA migraine sufferer here too. Can't move my head, handle light of any kind, nausea, vomiting, nose bleeds the works! It's not something to take light but he doesn't have to nurse you and dote on you. He can leave you to do what you need to do for it. As for the comment. He's just overreacting", "NTA\n\nThings do not always come across the way you want them to when you are sharing text messages with someone.", "NTA, as someone who get severe migraines from a tumor in my head I understand how you feel. And alot of people don't understand it until they go through it themselves then act shocked Pikachu face when you tell them that's what you go through or they get mad bc they got called out for not being sympathetic and understanding.", "NAH for me. The only thing I believe you did wrong is the timing. I would have waited until he feels better and have a conversation with him to explain that this is how you feel with *every* migraine and you would wish for more sympathy now he knows what it feels like.\n\nBut I may also be biased, since my husband is used to turn my complains in to a \"misery competition\", as I call it. Each time I say I'm tired he tells me how he's more tired and, at the specific moment, it pisses me off.", "NTA. I think it is good that your BF has had a taste of your life experience.\n\nLike you, I got severe migraines in my 20s, the kind where I laid in a dark, quiet room with an ice pack on my head for 3 days. No reading, no listening to anything, just me and the pain. Once my dad came over and nicely asked \"Can you come into the living room to visit with me and your mother. I warned him that I would immediately vomit, so he went and got a bucket.  I stood up, walked 5 feet and vomited.  THEN he believed me.\n\nMany people don't truly understand something that they have not lived. Just because you live through your migraines with grace and dignity DOES NOT MAKE IT AN EASY EXPERIENCE.\n\nI was very fortunate and in my early 30's the migraines stopped. I hope you have the same good fortune.", "NTA, neither of you ITA in my opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s an understandable remark but is definitely something you don\u2019t want to hear while sick. \n\nIts a good thing you apologized, but a \"this is how i feel\", basically reading him your post, would be good, as soon as he is in full health again. \n\nAs a male, I can say some of us sometimes need to be told very explicitly about what their partner wants/needs.\n\nJust tell him, if you want him to be more caring about your migraines again, and maybe even why, even if it seems obvious from the outside, he might not realize how important it is to you.", "NTA. And I hope you find the cause for your migraines, mine was diet induced from drinking apple juice. Was hard to find out because the migraine came 48h after consuming it. Now I rarely get a headache and never a migraine that takes me out for a day or two.", "Girl, get off Reddit \ud83d\ude02!

As someone who used to get migraines as severe and as frequently as you describe (less frequent since I started getting Botox treatment, highly recommend), I know that you can feel a lot of guilt towards your partner. This, however, is not something to feel bad about. You gently stated a fact. He might have been extra sensitive in the moment due to being sick, but that doesn\u2019t make what you said wrong or mean. \n\nI also want to add that it\u2019s fine to want sympathy and care from your partner, even (or especially) if it\u2019s a recurring thing. If you get frequent migraines, then that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be part of the full experience of being your partner. I try to manage mine on my own as best I can, but my fianc\u00e9e never once complains about cancelled plans or caring for me (even though I frequently tell her it\u2019s okay if she wants to). Your partner should care about your well-being more than they should feel inconvenienced by you being ill.", "Yeah, I get really sick, I can't even move my head or walk without feeling the pain. \n\nMuch less eat. I can't look at a screen or anything light and have to shut the blinds in my entire apartment just so it's safe to leave my bed.\n\nNot to mention the times it's so bad I have to call out of work because I can't even look at a screen.\n\nSometimes I do put up with it and work through the migraine cause no choice but sometimes it's just death. I'm sorry you have to deal with it too D:", "To clarify, this  was in Voice\n\nHence me emphasizing the fact I was using a very gentle tone and I was very clearly being sympathetic towards his pain because I go through it all the time.", "I wish mine stopped in my 30's. I'm 36 and still get them just as bad.", "thank you ! I'll talk to him about it when he's feeling better.\n\nthough for me it's just kind of the chicken and the egg- I want him to show me more care without me having to ask because me having to ask kind of feels like it'd be forced afterwards. \n\nD:", "Mine is gluten! Glad you found the culprit. Took me long enough too. I used to get ocular migraines. Hard to do much when your vision is so wavy you can't really see \ud83d\ude15", "Mine can cause stroke-like symptoms. They haven't caused an actual ministroke or stroke, yet. But it's entirely possible it can happen. Definitely NTA.", "It was sort of an insensitive thing to say, but I understand why you said it. I don't think it makes you an asshole. I think it makes you a person who is frustrated with a partner who does not seem to be very empathetic.", "I understand you, but maybe he doesn't show you more care, because he doesn't know how to. Have you told him what you want/need from him? You should be able to have an open conversation about your needs with your partner.", "I know he tries, but a lot of the time and because it's literally a constant thing, it's just something I have to live with and a lot of the time I do feel like my pain is ignored because it's a constant.", "Sadly, it's entirely likely that he is realizing just what an impact a chronic illness can have on a relationship. People think they xan handle it until they actually experience the reality of it. They become desensitized to it and lose empathy or sympathy. My husband tries to be understanding, but even he is tired of the frequent E.R. and urgent care trips. I'm lucky that my job provides intermittent leave as an ADA accommodation, which is separate from FMLA. My migraines always last multiple days, but my symptoms ebb and flow, so for a couple hours I may be able to somewhat function, but not enough to work. I had to take 3 days last week because of a migraine and my husband was visibly annoyed/disbelieving. He has even outright told me that he thinks I can do more and power through work more often.", "It probably is ignored a little bit because that is your cross to bear. There's not really much that your partner or anyone else can do about your migraines.\n\nAnd that really sucks. And I'm sorry that you are dealing with that challenge. I used to get really bad headaches as a kid. Not migraines but definitely went for years where I had more days with a headache than without.", "I know. Sadly usually nothing helps, but a little kindness can go a long way for me personally\n\nHe can't fix it but I would like him to show a little bit more care when I'm clearly suffering.", "He's probably giving practically everything he can.\n\nHave you shown him what kindness looks like? Have you gone out of your way to thank him and express your appreciation for the things he DOES do to lighten your load?\n\nLove and appreciation and kindness are things that we pass back and forth between each other.", "I know. And I always always do.\n\nEspecially because one of his biggest pet peeves is being taken for granted. \n\nAnd I always make sure to thank him for taking care of me, loving me, being here for me. \n\nI never said he wasn't a good partner to me, he is. I love him very much. And I know he loves me too.\n\nI don't expect him to run in circles around me and I don't get mad at him for not giving me more caring than usual when I'm in pain, because I know it's not all about me and he has his own shit to deal with.\n\nhowever, he now has a better understand of something I live with on a permanent basis and I think it'll definitely help him understand better how much I struggle with it."]}
