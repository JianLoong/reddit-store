I could never get past the sophomore classes and ended up having to switch majors to a degree I am still pursuing part-time to this day.\n\nmy younger brother (25, M) also went to get a CS degree. Unlike me, he's a prodigy. He graduated with a 4.0 GPA and immediately got snatched up for a dev job the second he graduated. I'm not jealous of him but seeing him succeed like this really did a number on my mental health. Every time I hear about his high-paying job or how well he did in college it sends me into a spiral of depression reminding me how much of a failure I am.\n\nLast year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me. He was understanding and said he would avoid talking about it.\n\nLast night, my family got together for dinner. My brother got up and said he had a huge announcement. He's been promoted at work, got a massive raise, and has a 10k bonus. My family was all super excited and happy. But when I heard that it just reminded me of the world I could never make it to, and of my failures. I broke down crying and ran out of the restaurant. My mom followed after me (she's really the only one who understands my depression) to console me. When I was talking to her, I explained that he promised me he would not talk about his job because he knows how it makes me feel.\n\nMy mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question. She went into the restaurant and left me outside. I ended up just going home afterward because that made everything worse.\n\nMy friends and coworkers, I told the story to all backed me up and said it was incredibly inconsiderate of him to do this. But I just got a text from my dad telling me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop \"being a little brat.\" My brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \"after my stunt\" he realized I'm \"only trying to silence him because of my ego.\" Which, btw, is not true at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so conflicted now and just don't know what to do.", "created_utc": 1677636371, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11er5qg/aita_for_crying_and_leaving_the_room_when_my/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can be jealous of that success, but you should also be happy for him", "I really hate to say this, because I know you're hurting...\n\nBut YTA. There's some information missing, which I won't ask or pressure you for. But it was unreasonable in the first place to make your brother \"promise\" to not speak or be proud of his own success. I understand that with mental health issues, it can be difficult to contain an emotional response like you had. But I still believe it could've been handled more appropriately by yourself.

Your brother really shouldn't have made that promise. It might have been okay to avoid talking about it for a few weeks or months while you actively sought help managing your feelings about this, but it's not reasonable to ask your brother to avoid celebrating his successes indefinitely unless you can match them. You're different people, and you're going to be good at different things.  \n\n\nYour brother's success doesn't diminish you.

Your brother wanted to share and celebrate something important with his family. This was not about making you feel bad or anything, but about him.

I could never get past the sophomore classes and ended up having to switch majors to a degree I am still pursuing part-time to this day. \n\nmy younger brother (25, M) also went to get a CS degree. Unlike me, he's a prodigy. He graduated with a 4.0 GPA and immediately got snatched up for a dev job the second he graduated. I'm not jealous of him but seeing him succeed like this really did a number on my mental health. Every time I hear about his high-paying job or how well he did in college it sends me into a spiral of depression reminding me how much of a failure I am. \n\nLast year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me. He was understanding and said he would avoid talking about it. \n\nLast night, my family got together for dinner. My brother got up and said he had a huge announcement. He's been promoted at work, got a massive raise, and has a 10k bonus. My family was all super excited and happy. But when I heard that it just reminded me of the world I could never make it to, and of my failures. I broke down crying and ran out of the restaurant. My mom followed after me (she's really the only one who understands my depression) to console me. When I was talking to her, I explained that he promised me he would not talk about his job because he knows how it makes me feel. \n\nMy mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question. She went into the restaurant and left me outside. I ended up just going home afterward because that made everything worse.\n\nMy friends and coworkers, I told the story to all backed me up and said it was incredibly inconsiderate of him to do this. But I just got a text from my dad telling me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop \"being a little brat.\" My brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \"after my stunt\" he realized I'm \"only trying to silence him because of my ego.\" Which, btw, is not true at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so conflicted now and just don't know what to do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CS is not your thing, and someone should have helped you realize that before you went to Uni. You need to learn where your strengths lie and apply those. You also need to work on your jealousy (you have some). \n\nI also have some concerns about your family. Calling you names, etc., isn't helping you at all, and I wonder if that goes on a lot. Therapy is a wonderful way to look at family dynamics like these, and I think you could find better support for better mental health that way.", "YTA\n\nInstead of congratulating your brother for his success and achievement, you threw a huge public tantrum and made it all about yourself.

Failure is not fun, struggling is not fun, depression is a beast. I've been there.

Being self-accepting is its own kind of success.  I'm lucky to know someone as cool as her, and the more I accept her as she is the more she opens up to me about the struggle with being successful.
