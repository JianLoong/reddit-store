I could never get past the sophomore classes and ended up having to switch majors to a degree I am still pursuing part-time to this day.\n\nmy younger brother (25, M) also went to get a CS degree. Unlike me, he's a prodigy. He graduated with a 4.0 GPA and immediately got snatched up for a dev job the second he graduated. I'm not jealous of him but seeing him succeed like this really did a number on my mental health. Every time I hear about his high-paying job or how well he did in college it sends me into a spiral of depression reminding me how much of a failure I am.\n\nLast year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me. He was understanding and said he would avoid talking about it.\n\nLast night, my family got together for dinner. My brother got up and said he had a huge announcement. He's been promoted at work, got a massive raise, and has a 10k bonus. My family was all super excited and happy. But when I heard that it just reminded me of the world I could never make it to, and of my failures. I broke down crying and ran out of the restaurant. My mom followed after me (she's really the only one who understands my depression) to console me. When I was talking to her, I explained that he promised me he would not talk about his job because he knows how it makes me feel.\n\nMy mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question. She went into the restaurant and left me outside. I ended up just going home afterward because that made everything worse.\n\nMy friends and coworkers, I told the story to all backed me up and said it was incredibly inconsiderate of him to do this. But I just got a text from my dad telling me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop \"being a little brat.\" My brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \"after my stunt\" he realized I'm \"only trying to silence him because of my ego.\" Which, btw, is not true at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so conflicted now and just don't know what to do.", "created_utc": 1677636371, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11er5qg/aita_for_crying_and_leaving_the_room_when_my/", "score": 1122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's some information missing, which I won't ask or pressure you for. But it was unreasonable in the first place to make your brother \"promise\" to not speak or be proud of his own success. I understand that with mental health issues, it can be difficult to contain an emotional response like you had. But I still believe it could've been handled more appropriately by yourself.

Your brother wanted to share and celebrate something important with his family. This was not about making you feel bad or anything, but about him.

I could never get past the sophomore classes and ended up having to switch majors to a degree I am still pursuing part-time to this day. \n\nmy younger brother (25, M) also went to get a CS degree. Unlike me, he's a prodigy. He graduated with a 4.0 GPA and immediately got snatched up for a dev job the second he graduated. I'm not jealous of him but seeing him succeed like this really did a number on my mental health. Every time I hear about his high-paying job or how well he did in college it sends me into a spiral of depression reminding me how much of a failure I am. \n\nLast year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me. He was understanding and said he would avoid talking about it. \n\nLast night, my family got together for dinner. My brother got up and said he had a huge announcement. He's been promoted at work, got a massive raise, and has a 10k bonus. My family was all super excited and happy. But when I heard that it just reminded me of the world I could never make it to, and of my failures. I broke down crying and ran out of the restaurant. My mom followed after me (she's really the only one who understands my depression) to console me. When I was talking to her, I explained that he promised me he would not talk about his job because he knows how it makes me feel. \n\nMy mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question. She went into the restaurant and left me outside. I ended up just going home afterward because that made everything worse.\n\nMy friends and coworkers, I told the story to all backed me up and said it was incredibly inconsiderate of him to do this. But I just got a text from my dad telling me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop \"being a little brat.\" My brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \"after my stunt\" he realized I'm \"only trying to silence him because of my ego.\" Which, btw, is not true at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so conflicted now and just don't know what to do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CS is not your thing, and someone should have helped you realize that before you went to Uni. You need to learn where your strengths lie and apply those. You also need to work on your jealousy (you have some). \n\nI also have some concerns about your family. Calling you names, etc., isn't helping you at all, and I wonder if that goes on a lot.

And I'll perhaps always  be a bit behind. And sometimes it still hurts. But I have managed to overcome the more intense feelings. Give it time OP.\n \nIt does seem like some time has passed, and perhaps you need more, perhaps you need the distance, and that's ok, but you do need therapy. And maybe cut down on celebrating with family in the meantime. Your brother too has worked hard, he deserves to be celebrated.", "I think he definitely coulda told them without you being there, being that you literally just asked him to not talk about it infront of you because it makes you feel like you\u2019re less than. But also, you being more focused on his milestones instead of yours is probably what\u2019s making you so depressed. Cause even if he has more than you, you\u2019re still doing good. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the only one comparing yourself to him. The more you focus on your career, the better it\u2019ll get.", "Maybe you should have gotten help of your brother instead. Couldn't he help you study etc", "I know exactly how OP feel, I am in a similar spot. I attended school with my friends and partner to work jn a specific field, and everyone succeeded except for me. I haven\u2019t been able to find my way into the industry and watching my partner and best friends get promotions or jobs that I would do anything for, is heartbreaking. It makes me cry, hate myself and more. BUT. They are my loved ones, their happiness is something I am grateful for no matter the cause. You aren\u2019t an asshole for feeling like you do, but YTA for asking your brother to pause his life for you. You can ask for support and comfort without imposing on his achievements. Ask others for help with these emotions, preferably a therapist. \nSo yeah, I get you, but YTA.", "Here's what to do. Your looking at his success and thinking you failed- Stop that! You didn't. His life is not yours, and your is not his. Some people can process things easy, it's still work. This was not your thing, sometimes as bad as you want it you just can't force.  Take a deep breath.  Your feelings are valid yet its trauma you have to work through. You asked him a promise last year? That's along time to hold on to this friend.  You can do hard things and getting beyond why this is bothering you so much is needed. You being upset at something you could of been happy about, or watched your parents be happy for him because your struggling with that. This moment happened I don't think your an a hole for it, I do think this thinking is not healthy.  Sometimes you have to admit your feelings are leading you to a place that your not happy. You ask your self why and then the answer- because it makes you feel like a failure you said. But your not a failure. Replace that thought with whatever your doing now, or working on.  It's not always easy, but holding on to things we need to let go of is worse. Hope you all the best & peace of mind.  I could have been a rich but Im dream camping enjoying the day I got left.", "I think the problem you have is within yourself. You have depression and insecurities, but it is not your brother's fault. He should be allowed to celebrate his successes. He was very nice about toning it down for your sake, but to think he should never ever talk about his successes around you is asking too much.\n\nYou need to go to therapy to work on this depression. Stop comparing yourself to your brother. CS was not your strength but something else is, so go find your own niche and enjoy that. If depression is getting in the way and therapy doesn't help, you could try medication. That can do wonders for some people.", "NAH, you need help. You behave unusual/unsettling because you have mental health issues.\n\nYour brother is allowed to be proud of his success and share it with his family. \n\nSeek help. Start with your family and explain your situation. Depression is an asshole that tricks your brain into painting everything dark/unfair and seeing enemies everywhere.\n\nP.S.\nLife is not decided by the easy successes, but how you deal with setbacks. Sometimes, the setbacks are so severe that they seem like a sucker punch. It's always ok to seek help.", "Stop being so whiny and try to get yourself better. People shouldn't have to tip toe around you because you are triggered by their success.", "INFO: what are you studying now?", "I would say NTA because you had confided in your brother and he had actually promised you. \n\nYou probably wouldn't have reacted the same way if you knew he could be talking about his job because he didn't consider it such a problem for you.\n\nStill, get some psychological help. You can still succeed in life !", "So I have mixed emotions about this. I feel that it is fair for you to ask him not to talk about it when it is just the two of you, but don\u2019t ask him not to talk about important things that happen in his life that make him proud when the family is together. If he only were to share that information when you weren\u2019t around, it would place an undue burden on him. \n\nI feel as though the reactions that you got were strong reactions to what you had asked. I don\u2019t want to focus too much on them, though, as they are being filtered through your perception and I would prefer to just look at what you willingly admit to doing. \n\nAlong with this, please don\u2019t feel as though you are an AH for feeling depressed and attempting to avoid difficult emotions. This is where having a neutral party (like a therapist) would be wonderful. I am hoping that you will find that, while you had difficulties with one program of study, it does not make you lesser of a person. You have strength in other areas of life and you are intelligent, regardless of classroom performance. You are no less of a person for finding what is right for you.  \n\nFinally, you had a reaction of crying and running out of the restaurant. Don\u2019t spend your time dwelling over if it was an AH move or not; it\u2019s a past event that you can\u2019t change. Ask yourself if you could handle a similar situation in a different way in the future. Perhaps look at how you, too, can celebrate your brother\u2019s successes along with him (and everyone else), knowing that you have your own reasons to be proud of yourself. They will celebrate with you, too. Sending much love your way in hopes that you find happiness, growing from the struggles of the past.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole here\u2026 it sounds like you\u2019re really going through a tough time and are being triggered, but your successes are not worthy of comparison, and maybe there\u2019s something better out there for your career wise. Money isn\u2019t everything, your brother may have all the money but you have value too.", "INFO: do your parents celebrate you and your accomplishments and make you feel valued and recognized for your own aptitudes and gifts? \n\nIf so, and you are just stuck on this \"he made it in CS and I didn't,\" then I still would stop short of calling you TA, and I still think your parents' response was AH-ish, but I would say you have your work cut out for you. Sometimes we can all be our own worst enemy. \n\nI can empathize with you. Almost 10 years ago, I was \"encouraged\" to leave a PhD program in a STEM field. It was a real ego beating after all the time and effort I put into it, and to this day, I find it just a little hard to hear about former colleagues wonderful successes. I get over it quicker these days, it doesn't send me into a spiral, but there is always that immediate \"ouch.\" If some of the other commenters here find it easy to \"cheer on\" their former colleagues, bully for them -- for most of us, it takes time and it'll always be a little bit painful. I can only imagine if I had one of these people as a sibling and I had to watch up close. I don't think I'd cope any better than you, tbh, at least till I got some distance from the situation.\n\nThat aside, I suspect there is a pattern here in the family dynamics of accolades to brother, sighs regarding OP. This behavior isn't about this one incident. Sounds like parents have labeled you as a \"f\\*\\*\\* up\" or at least \"less than\" and that you may even have become a scapegoat. How tf are you supposed to pull out your best coping skills in the middle of that dynamic? As for mom and dad criticizing you for losing control of your emotions... they need to take the plank out of their own eye -- telling you to \"grow tf up\" or \"a brat\" doesn't show a whole hell of a lot of impulse control, and they're the people who role modeled how to regulate emotions (or how not to, as the case may be) so it's no surprise you have trouble there.", ">My mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question.\n\nYou should listen to your mom, she's right.\n\n>Last year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me.\n\nYou were out of line to even ask him to do that. I'm sorry that you are having a rough time, but that doesn't give you a right to silence your brother and make him be quiet about his accomplishments.\n\nI know everyone else in the comments is telling you the same thing, but you need therapy, you should have been in therapy for the past few years at least. Your depression isn't going to go away if your brother isn't successful. Your reaction to his promotion should have been happiness, you should be proud of your brother for achieving what he has, not pissed off because you couldn't do it.\n\nAlso, there are a LOT of people in the world that are going to be much more successful than you or I could ever hope to be, that's life bud. If you compare yourself to people more successful than you, you are guaranteed to feel like a failure.\n\nMost importantly, CS college and programming skill is not the only path to success and happiness in life. I guarantee there are things you are better at than your brother. Maybe you are more artistic or musical, maybe you are more of a people person, maybe you are great at working on cars, maybe you are a great cook. I don't know you or your skills, but no one is better at EVERYTHING than anyone else. Everyone has strengths, everyone has weaknesses.\n\nMy sister and I are very different people with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. I'm the \"smarter\" one, because I'm better at math, problem solving, computers, and finances. But she's way more empathetic than me, she's much better at building and maintaining relationships. She's much braver than me, I don't think she would hesitate for a second to jump out of a plane while skydiving, whereas I freak out on roller coasters that go too high. Even though I'm the \"smart\" one and have achieved more success in my career, she's way happier than me.", "Yta", "OMG OP! You are definitely YTA. Stop wallowing in self-pity and feeling sorry for yourself. It\u2019s honestly pathetic. \n\nThere was a time in my life where I had to give up on my dream of being a doctor, drop out of university, and take a job working graveyard shift at a gas station for $11/hr, where all my college friends would come in to get snacks and I could just see the pitty in their eyes. I couldn\u2019t get high enough grades in my physics and calculus classes to be a competitive med school candidate, and I was already taking longer to finish my bachelors degree than everybody else. Meanwhile, my little sister was breezing through her degree at a somewhat prestigious university with a 4.0 and getting really good internship opportunities. Granted, her degree is in marketing so it\u2019s not as rigorous, but it was still hard to come to terms with my own failure. \n\nI did not feel jealous of her, I did not make her promise not to talk about her life and share good news with me, and I did not run away crying when she got a good job and was able to purchase a nice house after graduation. Instead, I picked myself up, got my shit together, went back to school, became a registered nurse, got an amazing job in the ICU, and now I\u2019m working toward my ultimate goal of becoming a flight nurse. \n\nNo, I did not achieve my original goal of becoming a doctor, but I still get to do an awesome, adrenaline-fueled job, still get to treat the human body, still get to use my brain and have a level of autonomy in my work, and I still get to pursue my love of science. I love my job, I pick up tons of overtime even though I don\u2019t even need the money just because I love what I do. I\u2019m incredibly happy, my life is amazing and I don\u2019t regret my decision to become a nurse, medical school just wasn\u2019t for me. \n\nStop being so hung up on the past and start looking toward your future.

Well into adulthood and therapy and I don't know that our relationship will ever be repaired.
