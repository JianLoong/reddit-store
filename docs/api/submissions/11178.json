I could never get past the sophomore classes and ended up having to switch majors to a degree I am still pursuing part-time to this day.\n\nmy younger brother (25, M) also went to get a CS degree. Unlike me, he's a prodigy. He graduated with a 4.0 GPA and immediately got snatched up for a dev job the second he graduated. I'm not jealous of him but seeing him succeed like this really did a number on my mental health. Every time I hear about his high-paying job or how well he did in college it sends me into a spiral of depression reminding me how much of a failure I am.\n\nLast year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me. He was understanding and said he would avoid talking about it.\n\nLast night, my family got together for dinner. My brother got up and said he had a huge announcement. He's been promoted at work, got a massive raise, and has a 10k bonus. My family was all super excited and happy. But when I heard that it just reminded me of the world I could never make it to, and of my failures. I broke down crying and ran out of the restaurant. My mom followed after me (she's really the only one who understands my depression) to console me. When I was talking to her, I explained that he promised me he would not talk about his job because he knows how it makes me feel.\n\nMy mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question. She went into the restaurant and left me outside. I ended up just going home afterward because that made everything worse.\n\nMy friends and coworkers, I told the story to all backed me up and said it was incredibly inconsiderate of him to do this. But I just got a text from my dad telling me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop \"being a little brat.\" My brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \"after my stunt\" he realized I'm \"only trying to silence him because of my ego.\" Which, btw, is not true at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so conflicted now and just don't know what to do.", "created_utc": 1677636371, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11er5qg/aita_for_crying_and_leaving_the_room_when_my/", "score": 275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's some information missing, which I won't ask or pressure you for. But it was unreasonable in the first place to make your brother \"promise\" to not speak or be proud of his own success. I understand that with mental health issues, it can be difficult to contain an emotional response like you had. But I still believe it could've been handled more appropriately by yourself.

You're different people, and you're going to be good at different things.  \n\n\nYour brother's success doesn't diminish you.

Your brother wanted to share and celebrate something important with his family. This was not about making you feel bad or anything, but about him.

I could never get past the sophomore classes and ended up having to switch majors to a degree I am still pursuing part-time to this day. \n\nmy younger brother (25, M) also went to get a CS degree. Unlike me, he's a prodigy. He graduated with a 4.0 GPA and immediately got snatched up for a dev job the second he graduated. I'm not jealous of him but seeing him succeed like this really did a number on my mental health. Every time I hear about his high-paying job or how well he did in college it sends me into a spiral of depression reminding me how much of a failure I am. \n\nLast year I talked with him about these feelings and asked nicely if he would not talk about his job or programming around me. He was understanding and said he would avoid talking about it. \n\nLast night, my family got together for dinner. My brother got up and said he had a huge announcement. He's been promoted at work, got a massive raise, and has a 10k bonus. My family was all super excited and happy. But when I heard that it just reminded me of the world I could never make it to, and of my failures. I broke down crying and ran out of the restaurant. My mom followed after me (she's really the only one who understands my depression) to console me. When I was talking to her, I explained that he promised me he would not talk about his job because he knows how it makes me feel. \n\nMy mom blew up at me out of nowhere when she heard this. She called me jealous and spiteful and told me that it's incredibly selfish of me to even dare ask him that question. She went into the restaurant and left me outside. I ended up just going home afterward because that made everything worse.\n\nMy friends and coworkers, I told the story to all backed me up and said it was incredibly inconsiderate of him to do this. But I just got a text from my dad telling me to \"grow the fuck up\" and stop \"being a little brat.\" My brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \"after my stunt\" he realized I'm \"only trying to silence him because of my ego.\" Which, btw, is not true at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so conflicted now and just don't know what to do.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

CS is not your thing, and someone should have helped you realize that before you went to Uni. You need to learn where your strengths lie and apply those. You also need to work on your jealousy (you have some). \n\nI also have some concerns about your family. Calling you names, etc., isn't helping you at all, and I wonder if that goes on a lot.

Being self-accepting is its own kind of success.  I'm lucky to know someone as cool as her, and the more I accept her as she is the more she opens up to me about the struggle with being successful.

And instead of communicating like adults everyone in his family is shaming and attacking OP.\n\nNTA", "How\u2019s he supposed to give him a heads up if he\u2019s not supposed to talk to him about it?", "I still think YTA, with some caveats: \n\nAs stated above, depression is very real it truly warps your sense of reality, BUT the damage you do while you\u2019re in a depressive state is also very real. This is stuff that you will have to work to repair, and sometimes repairing isn\u2019t even an option. \n\nPlease see a therapist and possibly a psychiatrist to get on meds. You\u2019re doing a lot of damage that once you are feeling better, will start a cycle of shame. It\u2019s time to take some control of your life (by getting a therapist) and stop passively letting the depression take you absolutely nowhere good.", "You've got ESH, NTA, and YTA. Which one is it?", "Are you for real..? Talk about cut of your nose to spite your face. Who's to say OP won't have a breakdown the moment anyone else mentions the successful career they are enjoying. This is a him problem, not a them problem.", "Nah, his an AH. He is jealous of his brother to a point that he can\u2019t be around for hear about any successes. you also don\u2019t ask someone to avoid talking about their job just because you are around. Like what could the brother do, have a exclude OP from a dinner so he can tell everyone else without op freaking out", "It\u2019s not insufferable to share accomplishments with one\u2019s family.", "I didn\u2019t think the brother sounded insufferable, its not like he constantly shoved his brothers face in it, he made an announcement that he had advanced in his career, the first time his success was brought up in front of OP in an entire year (OP said he talked to his brother a year ago about his feelings), I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wrong of his brother to celebrate his achievement with his family, even if OP is there, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s always bringing up stuff and bragging about it. What made you think the brother was insufferable? I\u2019m genuinely curious and not being an ass here by the way!", "Are you crazy? It\u2019s not his brothers fault OP didn\u2019t make it to the stage he\u2019s at. He shouldn\u2019t be banned from talking about his accomplishments because OP can\u2019t handle the fact he didn\u2019t make it. \n\nIt\u2019s YTA 100% if he doesn\u2019t put down his accomplishments or insult him then he has the right to tell his parents happy news about the job he worked hard to get.", "Maybe he thought avoiding talking about his job or programming meant not talking about the actual activities. It's completely unrealistic to expect a loved one to never ever mention their job at all, especially when they've had something good happen to them. Even if I thought OP's reaction was appropriate given the situation (it's not), it would at least be E S H, because asking somebody to never ever talk about their job and be banned from celebrating their hard work and achievements with their parents is completely unreasonable and definite AH behaviour.", "OP didn\u2019t say the brother invited everyone for the sole purpose of making this announcement, just that it was a \u201cfamily dinner.\u201d", "I don\u2019t think the brothers assessment is correct. That said, asking him not to talk about the job is really unrealistic and the OP should not be this triggered. Unless the brother and family members are incessantly rubbing into OPs face, the truth is there are a lot of people that are more successful. One cannot break down each time just because someone  gets promoted or a good job on the field.", "Thanks you for pointing it out. This is jealousy.", "Ok but op doesn\u2019t deserve to be called a brat by his dad. I\u2019d lean toward they both suck.", "Well expressed and insightful. OP would do well to heed this and to seek treatment for his self esteem issues as well.", "Beautifully written.  You have a gift in being able to deliver hard messages with compassion and empathy.", "So true. Honestly I\u2019ve realized that nothing I ever do is going to be good enough in my own mind. I\u2019ve just accepted it at this point, the solution is to enjoy the journey rather than just focus on the end result.", "OP said he talked to his brother LAST YEAR about it. It\u2019s not unreasonable for his brother to have expected that OP had taken some type of initiative to work through their feelings and that maybe pussyfooting around and walking on eggshells was no longer demanded.", "There has got to be a statute of limitations here. OP cannot expect the brother to walk on egg shells for years because of his mental health issues.", "Very well said!", "I was trying to be nice, but yes I do agree obviously.", "People are responsible for their own mental health. Especially when it affects others. The brother most likely didn\u2019t intentionally set out to brag in OP\u2019s face\u2014he was enjoying a family outing that didn\u2019t revolve around OP. \n\nYou\u2019re making a lot of assumptions that it was intentional. If I got awesome news, I\u2019m not thinking of the one person who wouldn\u2019t rejoice with me\u2014I\u2019m thinking of all of the people who will celebrate me. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely TA, OP. I don\u2019t care how many people rush to coddle you in these comments.", "I mean you said the request is unsustainable and it\u2019s pretty normal for families to share this type of information so it\u2019s not surprising this situation happened. It sounds like the brother respected it until this point but it\u2019s reasonable for him to do a normal thing and share his success with his family, he should be proud. If it\u2019s his brothers career then OP should have expected this to happen at some point. \n\n\nIt\u2019s too bad OP struggled and didn\u2019t succeed in this area but it\u2019s a big ask to expect his brother to not discuss his job with his family. \nI think this is a good situation to use the phrase, \u201cother people are not responsible for your triggers\u201d. OP will need to find a way to cope with this because it will likely come up again.", "Well idk bout you but if he was gonna break their agreement anyway... (you know by announcing it to everyone with OP there) then the boundaries were clearly void and a heads up wouldve been childs play compared to the announcement?!", "All of the above. Because the world doesn't exist in black and white, even in this sub.", "Which is why I suggested working on it in therapy as well as on his career. Stepping away will give him space and he won't feel pressure from them. Even if they're not disappointed in him, there's no way his mind wouldn't jump to conclusions. So taking time away to work on himself is good. And if going LC or NC helps, then so be it. His brother seems to be on a trajectory right now so it'll just be more friction for OP.", "> He shouldn\u2019t be banned from talking about his accomplishments because OP can\u2019t handle the fact he didn\u2019t make it. \n\nSo why did he agree to not talk about his work?", "Aww, thank you!  That\u2019s very kind of you to say!", "Would you also call up your brother to yell at him because he was struggling to celebrate you succeeding where he failed? Because that is *intentionally* cruel. He's not a stranger or acquaintance and relationships require communication and compassion on both sides.  OP needs to learn to untangle his sense of self worth from his brother, but being imperfect does not make someone an asshole. Calling someone you know is upset just to poke the wound is being malicious.", "Because he felt bad for OP since it happened he asked exactly when everything tanked for him and his brother was still doing good. So as a good sibling he agreed for that timeframe, it shouldn\u2019t mean he\u2019s expected to NEVER talk about it. That\u2019s unfair to his brother and makes OP a bad sibling.", "He agreed LAST YEAR, which has left plenty of time for OP to seek out help for their depression and unhealthy obsession with their brother\u2019s accomplishments and it was likely thought that walking on eggshells over a completely harmless topic was no longer warranted.", "\u201cMy brother also called me while I was at work and told me that \u201cafter my stunt\u201d he realized \u201cI\u2019m only trying to silence him because of my ego\u201d.\u201d\n\nNo where did it say his brother yelled at him. What his brother said is true. It\u2019s ego. Either mental health difficulty fueled ego or regular run of the mill insecurity fueled ego\u2014still ego. He didn\u2019t poke at him, he confronted him with the truth of how he feels. OP ruined HIS celebration night, regardless. OP\u2019s brother has feelings too, ya know.", "You mean, would I call out someone who was a grown adult that threw what reads to be an almost child like tantrum of tears and running out of a restaurant, and ruining the night for everyone else?\n\nYeah. I might be tempted to let them know how upset it made everyone else. Brother or not. Honestly\u2026 more likely if it was my brother. His insecurities/ego/self centered outlook outstripping, so badly, the pride he should have in his brother was appalling.", "> Because he felt bad for OP \n\nWe are mind-reading the brother now?\n\n>  it shouldn\u2019t mean he\u2019s expected to NEVER talk about it.\n\nUnless the time was actually given, yes its implied.  There are secrets that are never to be talked about.  Things like pregnancy loss, rape, or in this case triggers.\n\nAgain, the problem is that the brother agreed and then he didn't do it.  I get that you don't think that its right but that is what he agreed to and that is what the OP relied on.", "I mixed up OPs mother blowing up at him and the tone of his dads texts and applied it to his brother, that ismy error but the intention to hurt OP remains. And it wasn't his celebration night, they were out to dinner as a family and he decided to announce it. If OP is an asshole for having an honest emotional reaction to his brother why is his brother not an asshole for the same thing?  If OP's brother had said that in the moment I would be more understanding, but he waited till the next day and still was being intentionally hurtful.", "Yea but there is a not hurtful and inflammatory way to do that. This \"oh I should get the most satisfying zing in to Win the conflict\" call out shit makes for a fun tweet but shitty communication. OP being insecure and bad at controlling his emotions doesn't make him an asshole or any flaw makes someone an asshole. It's easy to say everything isn't about OP but why is everything about his brother?", "You\u2019re really comparing the brother doing good in his job and having nice accomplishments being talked about, being compared to rape and pregnancy loss?? Do you not get how drastically different those two are from talking about accomplishments??!\n\nAnd the brother I assure you didn\u2019t agree to never talk about it. He said he\u2019d only avoid talking about it but that doesn\u2019t mean he agreed to avoid talking about it forever. OP needs help and not the help which holding his brother back from telling his own family about what is making him happy.", "It\u2019s been years. Is everyone supposed to continue walking on eggshells around OP? Look, it can suck to see someone succeed at something you found out that you won\u2019t be able to accomplish. But what\u2019s the statute of limitations here? It cannot be years. OP needs to go to therapy and move past this because it\u2019s impacting the whole family.", "This makes no sense, what does 'wasnt his celebration night' mean? Did OP have some good news? Or even bad? If OP had some announcement that the brother's overshadowed then maybe depending on the situation we could discuss the brother being the AH.\n\nWhen else is the brother supposed to tell his parents about important stuff happening in his life than at the family dinner? Is the brother supposed to check in with OP every time something good happens in his life before sharing the news with his parents? \n\nOP's brother clearly deserves someone better than OP as his family.", "Because being upset at other people for succeeding is totally an asshole move", "I think we just need to agree to disagree.\n\nBecause for me\u2026. Yes. Being so insecure that you cannot control your emotions, in this type of instance, yes it does make you an asshole. He didn\u2019t find out he had terminal cancer, or any other life changing or catastrophic event. He found out his brother got a raise and promotion in a field he has been in**for years now**. He isn\u2019t 6. He\u2019s a grown ass man. Asshole move in my book.", ">  Do you not get how drastically different those two are from talking about accomplishments??!\n\nBecause, as I wrote, its a trigger for her.  Something that causes severe mental distress.", "It\u2019s not that deep of a trigger. OP obviously needs to seek therapy and learn not to resent their brother for doing good in his life when OP isn\u2019t. \n\nNever will talking about your accomplishments be as extreme as a trigger of rape or pregnancy loss. You\u2019re physically and mentally affected from that. OP is only mentally affected by their ego and their brothers life.", "> It\u2019s not that deep of a trigger.\n\nFirst you are telling what the brother intended/meant and now you are telling the OP what she is feeling.  You are basically rewriting the OP's story."]}
