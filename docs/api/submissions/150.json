{"id": 150, "submission_id": "yj1mu6", "title": "AITA for choosing someone else?", "selftext": "I'm I in the wrong for choosing someone else?\n\nHello everyone, sorry if there are some typos or errors in my writing English isn't my first language. I won't be using real names for safety issues. For starters when I was 18 I met Carlos(M 22), we started dating but 6 months later I had to leave the country for family issues but I would still visit every 2 to 3 months. A full year passed and Carlos started acting weird, turns out he was cheating on me with his best friend(F 20). When I knew that he was cheating, I kind of became petty, we ended our relationship officially but would still see each other occasionally just to do the deed. Still saying that he loves me and that stuff. This went on for a few years. I got a feeling of satisfaction just by turning the tables on the bestfriend because she knew from the start that he had a girlfriend. I know that she hates me with all her heart because she knows that we saw each other even do they are dating and living together. We are now 4 years older. In 2022 I met a new guy(M 23) that wants to date me and has been the best thing that has ever happen to me. Just to let you know carlos girlfriend goes out of the country for 3 months every 6 months to work and comes back. I left him the moment I knew I didn't felt the same way I used to feel when she left the other times. I ended the relationship but he has been looking for me non-stop.  Any idea of what I can do to overcome the routine of seen him or being with him?
