We have several lactose intolerant family members, one of them being my son\u2019s husband, so I made some recipes using oil or olive oil \u201cbutter\u201d over real butter, or using lactaid milk so it would be safe. I made sure to put the dairy free items apart from anything with regular milk and butter by having a separate small table for those dishes.\n\nMy son-in-law ended up feeling very ill and my son brought him to the ER that night. Even though I used safe ingredients he still had a reaction to something unknown in the food. My son rang me up from the hospital asking what was in the dishes at the dairy safe table. I told him I used oil, vegan butter, and lactaid. He was upset with me because I put milk into the mashed potatoes. I told him again I put lactaid milk so it would be safe.\n\nMy son-in-law is recovered and doing well. My son, however, is quite upset with me and claims he cannot trust me to cook food for them again because I \u201cmislabeled\u201d the food. He is claiming he has told me many times about his husband\u2019s dairy allergy, and I agree he has which is why I made separate food. It is now to the point where the family doesn\u2019t want me to make any diary free dishes for Christmas because I am \u201cfailing to understand.\u201d Instead they have all agreed my sister-in-law will make some of those dishes while my son and son-in-law will make the rest.\n\nI am beside myself because I love to cook for and feed my family. I feel I am being displaced when what happened on Thanksgiving could have been caused by a reaction to anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing... I understand my mistake now. It was an honest confusion. Of course I have apologized, and will again, to my son-in-law. I'm not sure why anyone doubts that. They do not want me to pay for his epipen or hospital visit. All they want is for me not to prepare food for my son-in-law any longer, which I understand now. I feel horrible I didn't look up the lactaid but I honestly thought it was safe. No, I didn't try to murder my son-in-law.

She made a point to add things like cheese into the food of her DIL because she was convinced she knew best and how her DIL was just being dramatic/overly sensitive.\n\nYour willfull neglect in repeatedly refusing to educate yourself or follow basic instructions from someone who knows better than you on the topic got someone sent to the ER as a direct result.\n\nLet me correct your title:\n\"Am I the asshole for putting dairy in a dish and claiming it was dairy free, again, and it was the final straw for my son so now he won't let me cook anything for family functions because I'm liable to poison his husband again?\"\n\nYou even claim \"He had an allergic reaction to something unknown in the food\" and then go \"Actually my son told me exactly what part I'd used that his husband reacted to but I decided that milk isn't actually dairy so why would it trigger a dairy allergy?\"", "YTA - lactaid milk is NOT dairy-free.

A dairy allergy is different than lactose intolerance. For people with lactose intolerance, that means they cannot process one specific sugar in milk, lactose. In those cases, lactaid and other lactose-free milks are viable substitutes, because they are milk without lactose, the one thing people with lactose intolerance cannot process. However, a dairy allergy is not just to that one sugar. It's to other parts of milk, too. So when you put lactaid in the potatoes, you were not making dairy-free potatoes.

An allergy is different, it could actually kill or hospitalize you. Lactose intolerance just means you don\u2019t have (enough of) the enzyme to break down the lactose in dairy (high fat items like butter are low lactose by nature), dairy allergy means your body thinks dairy is dangerous and has a reaction that can cause up to anaphylaxis (histamine reaction). Lactose intolerant people can eat butter, have traces of milk and consume milk with lactaid in it, since all have low to no lactose, dairy allergic people can\u2019t have ANY, no traces, only vegan alternatives like oil based products.\n\nIf your son told you he\u2019s ALLERGIC and you put milk in the dishes, you are a major asshole because you risked his husbands health and safety through your ignorance.
