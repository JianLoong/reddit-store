You can say no to babysitting for any reason honestly. (Especially if they aren't compensating you)", "NTA - if I understand your post, you are not getting paid? Why not?  Also, you are 20 years old, why are you being told what to do?\n\nYou are providing them free babysitting, on demand. Stop it, you\u2019re an adult, set some boundaries. The toddlers should be delivered to you and you should be paid.", "NTA. You're willing to babysit in your home and that's generous.\n\nFor the record, babies/toddlers/kids can all do errands with adults.  Sometimes it's not fun or productive, but that's the deal when you decide to start a family.", "NTA\n\nThey are taking advantage of you and are mad you realized", "NTA .. Why as a 20M are you letting yourself be told to Babysit rather than being asked ?", "NTA. You are not under any obligation to babysit if you do not want to. I hope they pay you when you do babysit.", "If you\u2019re mum, aunt and aunt\u2019s boyfriend (I think) are that bothered then one or all of them can go and babysit.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Not your monkeys, not your zoo. You don't have to babysit, EVER. If you are feeling generous enough to do so, they can bring them to your house or whatever is convenient for you. END OF DISCUSSION.", "NTA- You're already helping them out by babysitting. If they can't appreciate you, then don't do it anymore.", "NTA, if you don't make the child, you're not responsible for watching it. The act of babysitting is either a favor or a service for which you should demand payment.", "NTA", "NTA. They need you. Bringing them to you. Is not too much to ask.", "NTA. Stop babysitting for them. They don't pay you, and they are clearly taking advantage of you. Don't let them do this anymore.", "NTA do they pay you for this? Also they sound rude about it.", "Absolutely NTA since they aren\u2019t even paying you! You need to set up a price for your time, I think $20/hr is appropriate especially since it\u2019s last minute. \n\nCan you bring your gaming consoles to their house?", "You're 20. Why are you *told*? NTA", "NTA. Say No and don't feel bad about it. Their kids, they can find another babysitter. You're 20 years old, you can say No and go on with your life. Helping them out once in a while is just being a good guy and you can be that and still say Not today! They'll be alright. They can also figure out their sitter needs. NTA!", "NTA. You are an adult and no one can force you to babysit. Next time you get told that you\u2019re babysitting, say no and that you\u2019re busy. Do not explain or elaborate further. Your aunt is being extremely entitled when you\u2019re the one doing them a huge favor. Tell them that if they drop off the kids with you, you\u2019ll call the police and report them for abandoning their children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like a pretty reasonable request to me. \n\nThey are not paying you for this babysitting, right?

They need to ask you like an adult and if you have conditions such as them coming to your house they need to respect that or find someone else. It's not mandatory that you watch them for no compensation. They sound entitled and ungrateful.", "NTA your 20. Stop taking commands.

I know it's hard, but to protect yourself and prevent you from being taken advantage of, you need to set boundaries. You are an adult. You have a life. You are not at others beck and call. If you don't set boundaries now, it will be harder later, and they will try to guilt you. Good luck.", "Helping each other is good and a fundamental part of building a community. But there is a point where you need to stop because people are taking advantage. \n\nThis is one. \n\nYour offer is perfectly valid and very kind. Also tell them they can bring the children with them! Grocery shopping is not an emergency."]}
