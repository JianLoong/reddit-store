It\u2019s always better to talk to a doctor before going off meds so they can help you taper down to reduce discontinuation effects.

It\u2019s not a good idea in general to stop meds cold turkey, but sometimes you can\u2019t stand the side effects any longer. People have a right to refuse medication and treatment. Inpatient hospitalization and forced treatment requires someone to be a danger to themself or others or show that they are completely unable to take care of themself. \n\nMany psychotropic medications have terrible side effects. Stopping a medication cold turkey can have discontinuation effects that are unpleasant but rarely deadly unless there are underlying medical conditions or it\u2019s related to a specific class of medications. Some meds can be stopped cold turkey without many side effects (lithium) and some have to be stopped immediately if something like agranulocytosis or Steven Johnson\u2019s syndrome occurs (clozapine and lamotrigine, respectively). \n\nI don\u2019t recommend stopping any medications without help from a professional and a taper of those meds (especially benzodiazepines because the withdrawal can cause seizures). Symptoms would return when medications are stopped, which can cause issues, but no one should be forced to stay on medications.

As far as it seems it's not her safety that is at stake, like she's not at risk of harming herself or others physically? If someone with suicidal ideation stopped taking their meds, and they were expressing thoughts of suicide to you, reaching out to people who can look after her makes a bit more sense.  In this case though? Where you're just generically worried? And it seems like her issues with emotional regulation are impacting your relationship but not necessarily endangering her? I think it is controlling to threaten to tell her parents or friends about her medical or mental health issues. \n\nBut what you would not be the asshole for, is determining whether this is a relationship you want to stay in based on her mental health issues and her seeming unwillingness or difficulty with treatment for it.

I had another mental health professional originally dismiss me as BPD because I lied on my intake forms about being abused. Also, it isn\u2019t genetic.

Not all trauma, however, is caused by parents, which is why some people with normal seeming families end up with BPD. Bi-polar disorder IS genetic but Borderline Personality disorder is not.", "The way they said it definitely sounds a lot like how people minimize mental health issues.  \"glorified abandonment issues\" makes it sound like the cure is \"suck it up\" or \"toughen up\" vs therapy", "If she's having a bad reaction to the meds, she needs to go back to the doc to get different meds.  That's the nice thing about meds is that there are millions of different types, and if one doesn't work, you can get a different one.  Just say \"doc, these meds make me feel sick.  what else can you give me instead.\"\n\nI spend a lot of time in online ADHD-support groups, and both ADHD adults and the parents of ADHD kids will give up on meds after just one try.  \"Oh this med didn't work.  This one gave him mood swings, so we're just giving up on treating the ADHD entirely basically.  We're giving my kid essential oils now.\"  It can take years to find the right dosage and med combo, but it really is worth the effort.\n\nThat being said, from what I've heard, BPD doesn't respond well to meds, nor do other personality disorders, since personality disorders stem from cognitive distortions and disordered attachment styles and those sort of things.  But please do not get medical advice from a random chick of the internet.", "NTA, bpd is so SO hard and im sorry your gf is going through this but as long as she has A GOOD RELATIONSHIP W HER PARENTS, you should let them know. theres so many medications available that your gf just hasnt found the right one yet. let her know that youll love and support her no matter what and shes so amazing when shes her best self and the way that meds work isnt to dull us but to bring out who we really are, theres always an adjustment period but once you find what works you get to live WITH having borderline rather than  against it. its a struggle on both ends but i promise its worth it when you figure it out <3 (source: im 30 with bpd and currently ummedicated for insurance reasons but the years of medication and therapy helped me become a better person)", "Also it's illegal to share medical information about someone without their consent so op might be commiting a crime?", "Ah and here we have some ableism and misinformation", "Up to 70% of people with Borderline Personality Disorder had childhood trauma, which means it Is caused by trauma more often than not.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9762-borderline-personality-disorder-bpd#:~:text=Childhood%20abuse%20and%20trauma%3A%20Up,are%20also%20associated%20with%20BPD.", "This would only be the case if OP was their gf's medical provider (which would be highly unethical). There is nothing illegal for a non-healthcare worker to discuss someone else's health or medication. HIPAA, assuming you're in the states, only covers people who deal with the patient in a professional capacity, not friends and family.", "You weren't far wrong mate.", "Then I absolutely worded it poorly and I apologize for that because that\u2019s not at all what I meant. I meant the opposite actually that it\u2019s a severe form of trauma whereas it\u2019s not built into our genes like psychosis is. \n\nYou can\u2019t just toughen up when it comes to your trauma."]}
