Sudden cessation of psychotropic medication can have devastating effects. People who *need* medicine are notorious for thinking and saying they do not need the medicine.

There are negative side effects to any medication and she should be working with her doctor to figure out what is best for her.\n\nYou're not the AH, but I will tell you that informing her parents may negatively impact your relationship. Do the right thing and try to get her help no matter what means but be aware this could devastate your relationship for a while or even permanently.  \n\n\nETA: Adding that I'm speaking from personal experience and others may have different experiences.", "As someone with bpd, this is dependent on what type of people her parents are.

But listen: if you stay with her, this is going to be a battle you wage for your entire life. I understand that you care about her, but you need to care about yourself, too. She is going to resist taking the medication that stops her from treating you badly. You are going to have to argue with her over it, and there will be no one to make her take it. Is this how you want to live? You are wonderful for wanting to be there for her, and I'm sure she's a lovely person when she's medicated. But BPD can be brutal. Please think long and hard before committing your life to someone who may be incapable of truly committing hers to you.", "Not at all. My son is schizophrenic.  He's not taking his meds.

Being non-medicated can have a lot of negative side affects and can become dangerous. However maybe talk to her about starting DBT (It is a special type of therapy for someone with BPD and is proven to be more effective than meds. but still good to do with taking meds.) with a therapist. I helped me a lot and my BPD went into remission and it could potentially help her because if it is effective for her then their is a possibility that she would be okay without meds. But I would talk to her parents. I don't know her past, but for her safety it would be best. Maybe you guys  could talk to her together and discuss other options than meds because there are other options proven to be more effective.", "NTA, and I'd urge you to think very seriously if you want to tie your life up with this person.  IamNotaPsychologist, but in my limited experience this disorder does not get better with age.", "There is no right answer to this question - you will encounter two schools of thought: 1) it\u2019s for her own good so tell them, and 2) it\u2019s her choice to take her meds. However, neither of them have to do with you being controlling. The meds, ostensibly and if taken with side effects in consideration, will make her feel better. You want her to feel better; I don\u2019t think anyone can fault you for this.\n\nYou cannot force feed her medication. She is over 18 - her parents can only make suggestions that she can choose to not follow, just as you already are. Telling her parents is another set of people \u201chassling\u201d her to take meds she\u2019s adamant she \u201cdoesn\u2019t need.\u201d It will agitate her further and it will feel like a betrayal even if you tell her you\u2019re doing it as you\u2019re doing it, so be sure her parents are people she likes and has a good relationship with or else you will be escalating this to another level. \n\nYou need to ask yourself what you\u2019re willing to deal with. Diagnosis or not, she is making choices (granted affected by her diagnosis) and you don\u2019t need to go along for the ride after trying all you can. You are neither her doctor nor her parents; you are her partner and you have a choice if you want to be or not considering the situation. This is where I can somewhat see where \u2018controlling\u2019 comes in \u2014 rather than making choices for yourself in a hard situation, you\u2019re making choices for her (\u2018take your meds and I will do XYZ things to make you do it, like call your parents\u2019) to make the situation easier for you. \n\n\nINFO: What do you think her parents will do that you can\u2019t?

People have a right to refuse treatment unless they are under a court order, which it doesn\u2019t seem like she is. You also have a right to break up with her. Tattling to her parents is just childish and controlling especially if you don\u2019t know whether there was any trauma with her parents. BPD doesn\u2019t have any specific pharmacological treatments, and is mostly treated through therapy (usually DBT). Psychotropic meds have many intolerable side effects, I don\u2019t recommend anyone stopping meds cold turkey, but most discontinuation syndromes are not deadly aside from certain medication classes.", "I don't know if YTA exactly but telling on your girlfriend to her parents, or threatening to, is a great way to initiate a breakup", "This is a tough one, I think maybe NTA.  The thing is, I feel for you, it seems like you care about your girlfriend and you want her to be healthy.  So I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you have good intentions.  And your girlfriend should be following through with her treatments, or if she doesn't like the side effects, she should be discussing this with her doctors as opposed to simply stop taking the medication.\n\nThat said, ultimately it's something your girlfriend needs to do herself.  You can't force the issue, as it will only build resentment on her end.  Depending on how things development, if she doesn't want to follow through with treatment and you can't handle her behaviors because of it, you also wouldn't be the AH for walking away from the relationship either.  It's not all that different from an addict who refuses to get help for their illness either.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s an adult and she can manage herself and her medication on her own. \n\nI was also diagnosed with BPD and I made a conscience choice to stop taking my medication because of the side effects.

Given the risks, it wouldn't be out of order to loop in someone who can keep an eye on her case she runs into problems related to dehydration or stopping the meds, especially if she's been having a hard time keeping on top of self care stuff. \n\nOTOH, GF is an adult who is in charge of her own body and is justified in being annoyed if OP is pestering her to take meds that aren't working for her. Depending on how it was phrased, OP could certainly have come off as being patronizing or controlling even if that wasn't the intent.", "A gentle YTA. You are trying to control her.

Your options are to leave or not.", "Depends, hat is her relationship like with her parents? What do you think her parents are going to be able to do since she\u2019s a legal adult? Are they supportive or are they abusive??", "As someone who could be your grandmother, tell her parents and then get the hell out of the relationship. I worked with mental health patients when I was younger. They were the worst ones to deal with when not medicated. Your whole world will revolve around her moods.

BPD does not have a specific medication, and stabilizers may or may not work. What she needs more is therapy- DBT. Perhaps talk to her about talking to her therapist on changing meds.

Luckily my doctor is against polypharmacy and when I\u2019ve come out of hospitals on multiple antipsychotics and couldn\u2019t stand the side effects, he tapered me off so I was on only one. It\u2019s always better to talk to a doctor before going off meds so they can help you taper down to reduce discontinuation effects.

Inpatient hospitalization and forced treatment requires someone to be a danger to themself or others or show that they are completely unable to take care of themself. \n\nMany psychotropic medications have terrible side effects. Stopping a medication cold turkey can have discontinuation effects that are unpleasant but rarely deadly unless there are underlying medical conditions or it\u2019s related to a specific class of medications. Some meds can be stopped cold turkey without many side effects (lithium) and some have to be stopped immediately if something like agranulocytosis or Steven Johnson\u2019s syndrome occurs (clozapine and lamotrigine, respectively). \n\nI don\u2019t recommend stopping any medications without help from a professional and a taper of those meds (especially benzodiazepines because the withdrawal can cause seizures). Symptoms would return when medications are stopped, which can cause issues, but no one should be forced to stay on medications.

Once they become stable, they get that right back and can stop/refuse further treatment. \n\nOPs gf is capable of deciding medication side effects are not worth the benefit.
