Is regular showering, which I support, really worth losing a uncle who is willing to take kiddo for four days? Really don't think uncle would abide by a daily shower rule? Not telling you how to feel, just pointing out a family member who is willing/able to do a 4 day road trip is a rarity. Guess, question is kinda where would they shower? Cause this really feels like an old school road trip if the only shower was at the pool.", "I mean, \"asshole\" is too strong of a word, but I do think you're overreacting. NAH.\n\nBeing a boy has nothing to do with it. When you go on some trips, bathing isn't really the highest priority (especially for someone who hasn't hit puberty yet and isn't a sweaty stankball of hormones). My family camped a lot when I was his age and I would go several days without showering.\n\nBesides, a lot of adults don't shower every day and only address the \"important\" stuff like brushing their teeth. If the only thing you have to worry about is the kid coming back smelling like a Florida swamp in the summer, I'd call that a win.", "I don't anyone here is an AH, but I do think you're over reacting. I would be more mad that he hadn't changed his underwear for 4 days. But I wouldn't keep him from his uncle for that, I'd just burn the underwear he came home in!", "I\u2019m so confused but these comments. Like y\u2019all are comfortable and justifying that a child hasn\u2019t taken a shower for days is okay. That\u2019s concerning and he was in the care of his uncle. The uncle should\u2019ve made sure he was taking care of his nephew hygiene. To say he\u2019s just being a boy, is feeding him the wrong thing and breeds the behavior of having poor hygiene is good.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but you are overreacting. I\u2019d be more upset that my son didn\u2019t change his clothes than not having showered for a few days. However, I wouldn\u2019t restrict my sibling from seeing the kid unsupervised ever again for it. He was cared for, fed, and some hygiene was taken care of on a daily basis.", "YWBTA - I've worked at summer camps with children for a long time and you'd be shocked at how many 5 to 18-year olds don't change, shower or take care of their personal hygiene without explicit reminders. Especially when their at-home routines are missing. Professionals know this and we take extra care to help facilitate good hygiene. Your brother isn't a professional and probably acted the same way at this age. \n\nYour kid came home stinky but happy. I agree there is room for improvement in how your brother managed this but that should just be a conversation along the lines of ' thank you so much for taking my kid on a wonderful experience, can you please make sure he showers a couple times, and changes his clothes regularly because he's young and needs to be reminded.'", "NTA. He's 9. This is right around the age where parents start teaching kids about hygiene. Double check with your son about brushing his teeth.

You could just tell your brother that next time he gets a shower after a couple of days.  You BATHED a 9 year old ?   Was it to punish him?   You sound controlling and awful.  This should be a 2 situation and not a 10 problem.", "YTA. That's a huge overreaction. He wasn't in danger", "Not showering for 4 days is not a problem.\n\nI've been on sailing trips of several weeks where the only water we saw was salt water.

A lot.\n\nThe only thing I do have a problem with is the book b chief underwear. And that one is on your son. At nine he's old enough to know he needs to put on clean underwear every day and that includes socks. \n\nNext time give proper instructions to your brother. If you feel that your child has to shower at least every two days, then tell the caretaker that beforehand. You really can't expect them to read your mind.\n\n\nSo for the simple fact that you are punishing your brother for not being able to read your mind.

He\u2019s 9 he\u2019s old enough to listen to you. I also think it\u2019s weird that you had to shower him twice when he got home. My kids are old, but at 9 they we\u2019re definitely showering by themselves.", "Yes, YTA. The answer to that is no more unsupervised trips; not no access. If they went camping this would be shrugged off. And while I question your brother's hygiene, he took care of the teeth.", "YTA. Do you have any idea how lucky you are to have a sibling who wants to spend that much dedicated time with your son? This just sounds like when I would go to summer camp every year and come back absolutely disgusting. He had a unique fun experience that was a little bit of a break from normal expectations. No harm came to him, he bonded with his uncle and had a great time. And you want to deprive him of that going forward because he got a little dirty. It\u2019s extremely distasteful.", "NTA? I question it a little bit because, it feels like somewhat of an overreaction and stopping something that your kid probably really enjoys.\n\nLike what was stopping you from just saying \"bro look, you may not shower every day, but he needs to.\"\n\nIf he then pushes back on that THEN its a definite NTA.\n\nBut i'd feel for the kid and at least TRY to rectify the situation", "Unless your son was actually rolling around in the mud or otherwise doing something particularly dirty, I think you are over reacting. Four days without a bath are not a big deal for a boy.

NAH", "NTA was this a camping road trip or were they staying somewhere indoors in between days? If it was camping I could understand the not showering, but not even changing clothes? That I can't understand. I would maybe restrict just overnight/multiple visits if he disagrees strongly with these hygiene standards.", "YTA the only real concern is the lack of underwear change, which you could have tackled within going full nuclear\nPrepubescent kids don't need to wash as much as adults", "YTA. Yeah, it was irresponsible to not make the kid shower, but it\u2019s also not a big deal in the whole scheme of things. This isn\u2019t something that I would ruin an uncle-nephew relationship over. Just set some ground rules for next time that if he has any overnights, he must shower once a day. If he doesn\u2019t, then no more unsupervised visits.", "YTA Guys (young AND old) can be gross. They were male bonding and the kid brushed his teeth daily. It would be better if next time you asked your brother to make sure your son showers and changes his clothes regularly. \n\nYou totally overreacted and should apologize to your brother. Be thankful you have a sibling who cares about your son so much and wants to spend time with him.", "NTA. Ask your brother if he washes his ass while showering. I might know the answer already", "NTA - I wouldn't leave a child with your brother either.", "Seems like you\u2019re overreacting, but I\u2019ll say NAH", "NTA, you are the parent, it's your decision. I will say tho, I know people who go camping off the grid for 3-5 days at a time without showering. I know people who go camping at campgrounds with showers, but don't shower while they are there. I'm not saying he was right, like I said, it's your call. Personally I wouldn't be able to go that long, but this isn't about me.", "YTA. Your son is 9 years old, not 3 years old. \n>\nGoing 4 days without showering (especially if they\u2019re swimming etc) isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n>\nYou should be thanking your brother for the trip, instead of threatening that he can\u2019t see his nephew.

You're mad at the wrong person. Your child is 9. That's old enough to know that he should change his clothes and bathe regularly.

In the grand scheme of things, no one was hurt and this isn\u2019t a big deal. Do you know what is a big deal? Your son\u2019s relationship with his uncle. You need to go fix this.", "YTA: Kids like to not shower for a while I remember when I was that way. Your brother can\u2019t force your son to shower or wear different clothes.

A shower sure feels good, especially after climbing a mountain and applying layers of sunscreen, but skipping a shower doesn\u2019t make one sick. It just makes one stink.\n\nNot saying it would be ok to have a kid not shower for 4 days, I really don\u2019t know how dirty kids get and what skipping a shower does to their hygiene training, I would probably ask and respect what the parents think is necessary.

However, as you say, he had access to those things and chose not to. Your failure to instill your personal hygiene standards in your child is not your brother's fault.\n\n Your brother made sure your kid did the actually important stuff, like brushing his teeth.

I don't even really know how often kids that age are supposed to bathe. I'd also wonder if the kid can wash themself, do they take a shower or a bath, etc. I mean, I personally would probably *ask* the kids parents prior to the trip but I could also understand forgetting to ask. \n\nI don't think your brother was malicious, negligent or cruel, just clueless.

I don't understand how that translates to banning your brother (who was kind enough to take him on a road trip) from ever being alone with him again. \n\nThey were on a road trip, not in a warzone.

Win/win!", "I\u2019m not saying I would call CPS for this, but people are being nonchalant and not reading what OP said. He says that his brother can\u2019t see his son without either him or his mother present, not that he\u2019s banned from seeing his son ever.

This was probably the kid's decision... Either out of laziness or he was distracted by having a fun time and just grabbed whatever he took off.

Not talking to the person who will be watching your kid for 4 days about what you expect from them on the trip.

Your brother is not a parent who has multi-day experience with a 9 year old or their tendency to resist hygiene and expects you to communicate needed info.

Nothing is so obvious that it\u2019s obvious to everyone. \n\nOr\n\n2) Your son is old enough to handle these things himself without guidance and supervision, and already does this at home. He is aware of what he should do. Your brother sees hygiene as your son\u2019s responsibility accordingly. In this scenario, the onus is on your SON to continue basic hygiene routines away from home. \n\nOr\n\n3) You clearly communicated with your brother clear instructions/expectations about this issue, and warned that the 9 year old may resist or need help/guidance. He and your son also had access to everything needed to maintain a normal hygiene routine on this trip. This is the ONLY scenario in which your brother is the only one at fault and deserves the extremity you went to in your reaction. \n\nBased on your comments, it sounds like #3 wasn\u2019t the case here. That leaves 1 and 2, which also means you can\u2019t just blame your brother here. This means the closest judgment in your favor can be ESH. But, I will say, even in that one you are the biggest AH for overreacting and putting an inordinate amount of blame on your brother.", "NTA.

Your son was presumably fed, safe, and had a fun time with his uncle. He just got a little stinky. I think it would be fair to say 'no more overnights/long trips', but do you really think your brother couldn't handle taking the kid to the park to kick a ball around or going out for ice cream or something? He didn't commit child abuse here. Saying he can't be around your son alone is the kind of boundary you set for someone who is potentially dangerous, not one with a weak grasp on long term hygiene.

If so he might need instructions.\n\nOr next time be sure to tell your 8 year old your expectations.

As someone who likes doing outdoorsy things like hiking, backpacking, camping and back country canoe trips, not showering for the week is not even close to the end of the world.

My little cousin didn't like to bathe either when I used to babysit him, but I made him, because I was the one in charge and he needed to shower. You don't just throw your hands up and say, \"Aw well!\" for four days straight, not even getting him to *change his clothes.*", "This is the way \n\nSeriously everyone clutching at their pearls probably never went away to stay with a cousin or an uncle/aunt", "Best comment!", "Exactly this.", "This kid is 9 years old. Any neurotypical kid knows how to shower alone by then.", "Yeah it\u2019s really not a big deal. Had OP never gone camping? I am a big fan of showers but I know as a kid we\u2019d not always shower on camping trips.", "The number of showers varies a lot from country to country.\n\n\nI was born and raised in South America and it's hot here. No way my parents would allow me (and my siblings) not to shower every day (or at least every other day). As a teacher, who has works with 7th grade, I believe showering every day is a must. A quick shower is enough though.\n\n\n\nThat being said I believe OP is overreacting although I understand why she'd be upset.\n\n\n\nETA: years ago, when I was in college, I had a foreign roommate that showered once every two weeks. That's not a joke. He went to a run every morning and he basically never showered. He smelled bad. We both worked at the same place and one day the cleaning lady, who had no filter and it was *very* straightforward told him he needed to shower more and people were talking about his hygiene habits. He asked me about it and I told him I thought it was a good idea to shower more frequently.", "Dude, it's just gross. Flat out.", "You can get in a lot of trouble with CPS if you don\u2019t have a kid change clothes or shower for several days. It\u2019s the start of child neglect. Also, It\u2019s gross and if you don\u2019t see that then I have nothing else to say I guess because common sense isn\u2019t coming thru to you", "Also, if you aren\u2019t bathing and wearing the same clothes, it\u2019s real easy to get some nasty rashes where the dirty clothes rub your skin.", "You people are gross", "It is not a US Thing, I can guarantee you that most people of South America take a shower daily", "Me too", "What about four days in the same clothing, which I assume includes underwear? I have two 8-year-old boys, and their wiping skills are subpar at best.", "Hopefully zero because it\u2019s too ridiculous to even think about. I\u2019ve taken my kids of 4-5 day camping trips with no showers and 1 change of clothes. Cutting off contact with the son is an absurd overreaction.", "It would be absurd to call it neglect. There's a suitcase of clean clothes available, the kid just didn't care to use them.\n\nA 9yo should be given some bodily autonomy. A 9yo is not a baby.", "He also said his other clothes were untouched, so it seems quite likely he didn\u2019t change them. Still, a huge so what to all that. OP is crazy to cut off contact for that.", "She said the clothes were untouched\u2026", "No the boy wasn\u2019t clean, the uncle was.", "Haha - I didn't read far enough down and just said the same thing.  This mom ... yikes.", "Yup. Real good way to replace good memories with bad ones.", "Thank you! This is exactly my thought. The kid is 9! He can be responsible for  changing his own clothes.", "I think plenty of kids that age would wear the same clothes day after day which is why adult supervision is needed. \n\nI agree that the uncle wasn\u2019t holding the kids clothes hostage but it was his responsibility to enforce & remind the kid to at least change everyday.", "IKR!! my kids could both do laundry by that age.  Let alone dress themselves", "He\u2019s 9.\n\nI want to know if the brother showered at all. If the brother showered then why didn\u2019t he think his nephew needed one.", "this deserves more upvotes tbh!!", "What the heck do Biden and trump have to do with this dude? It\u2019s about a stinky kid", "you mean grossest comment. bathing isn't a skill. it's hygiene. do it.", "Yes, but I don\u2019t know any 9 year old kid that would suggest it. Again, wanting to shower is a different thing to being able to shower. When my little 10 & 11 yo nephews come to stay I have to nag them to wash, I don\u2019t have to actually wash them. OP\u2019s kid is on a road trip with his fun uncle, he\u2019s hardly going to say \u201ccan we stop for a shower\u201d.", "To me the no shower is a non issue for a kid this young. Not changing clothes for a week is weird but all in all no biggie. It was part of the fun most likely. I bet that the kid ate no veggies either! Gasp.\n\nGood hygiene and eating habits are important longterm but no one is going to be harmed by being grubby and eating fast food for a week. \n\nLet the kid live a little on vacation. Home sounds kind of stifling.", "Sure, it\u2019s a bit gross. But removing uncle\u2019s access to his nephew? That\u2019s a massively disproportionate response. Especially when OP sent their child on the trip commando in the first place.", "So's digestion. And sex. And childbirth. And existence. Life is gross. That's ok, and a good thing for people to learn.", "It\u2019s the start of child neglect if you\u2019re the child\u2019s primary guardians and do it frequently. No child services in the world would take a report of \u201che stayed with his uncle for 4 days and didn\u2019t change his clothes\u201d seriously for a moment. \n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s gross, I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s not gross, I said it wouldn\u2019t kill him. Doing something a bit gross once doesn\u2019t justify having access to the child totally removed forever. Do you know what\u2019s also gross? Going commando, which OP says they let the child do before sending him on the trip. Seems to be a bit of pot calling the kettle black here.", "An adult with no children has zero (or maybe not) experience coaching another human in wiping their butts. \n\nThis story is a good learning experience for everyone involved.", "Right? These people are wild. I grew up camping and would regularly go without showering for a week.", "How is telling a kid to not wear the same clothes for days straight depraving them of bodily autonomy? The shower thing is whatever since he washed his *feet and brushed his teeth but he should at least change his clothes which pick up germs and bacteria from wherever literally whatever he goes near", ">i thought the whole issue was that the uncle had showered regularly but didn\u2019t make the son shower and change too\n\nThat is the issue. The person you\u2019re responding to doesn\u2019t understand.", "Yes he should be responsible for changing but you\u2019d think after 4 days of seeing your nephew wear the same underwear shirt and shorts you\u2019d at least advise them to change into something clean", "FFS. My Kiddos at 9 can wash their OWN CLOTHES. LOL I'm not making them change their  clothes unless they stink or are overtly dirty or I want to take them somewhere lol....", "Why? It's not exactly harmful.  I mean it's my preference my kids wear clothes that aren't disgusting, but  by 9 there's a reasonably amount of autonomy that a child can exert.", "I\"ve been to summer camps that were sleep over where half the camp didn't shower the whole week. The cabins smelled awful at the end of the week but the kids didn't care and always had a good time. \n\nDestroying your relationship with a sibling for the sole reason of he didn't have him shower for a week (keep in mind he had him brush his teeth and wash his feet) and not letting him have contact with his nephew over this is incredible. Did he feed him? keep him safe? get him home at the right time? in any other way put the kid in danger?", "9 are tweens. 8 to 12 are considered tweens.", "You need to calm down buddy lmao. You have to realize reacting like this to an internet post cannot be good for your health. You\u2019re about to have a heart attack because of \u2026. What? I get it\u2019s hyperbole but Jesus you care too much and I hope you can take a chill pill lol", "So to be clear, you physically got involved to wash your 9 year old? As in, you put him the tub with no concern for his privacy and scrubbed him yourself? Is that normal for you?\n\nBecause most people without kids aren't going to do that for a 9 year old and it's bizarre to expect someone to automatically know that. You really should be clear to others what your child is capable and incapable of doing.", "I mean, ok? His uncle should know better. I don\u2019t have kids and I know better. His uncle should have made dressing him in fresh clothes and bathing him at *least once* a priority.", "I would send my kid on a trip with their uncle for the express purpose of being able to get out of showers without me nagging. Yeah! Have a ball! Be disgusting with someone else! \nI hate not being clean, but I have also been backpacking, worn the same clothes for a week, not showered, and been disgusting. No harm except for stank.", "This is ridiculous imo. By your own admission they know to wash and you have to nag them. You're dismissing their routine being broken by essentially saying they're 9yo and kids will be kids. That's why it's important to instill habits when we're young. The child doesn't have to stop and say it and we'll even ignore the fact that it seems like the uncle wasn't stopping and bathing in that time either: who thinks it's appropriate to never once change a child? A week's worth of clothes and not a single garment was traded out?\n\nYou're going to tell me a 9yo who couldn't be bothered to bathe for a week also was pristine enough never to stain his clothes by dirt or mess? Or is it okay to leave him in stained clothing too because he's just a kid and won't ask for his own change of clothes? Why does it need to be on the child in the first place to ask for these things? Why is it so hard to be the fun uncle and still encourage basic hygiene?", "Yeah. A lot of people get caught up in the rules without looking at the why behind them. You shower so you don't stink for the people around you. If the person you're road tripping with didn't notice the lack of showers the kid couldn't have been all that bad off. There's a time for routine. At home, when the routine is relevant. And there's a time to ditch the routine and just let things be for a few days. Nobody died. Nothing was destroyed. Nobody got sick. It's not a big deal.", "Absolutely, but my point is that after four days, a nine-year-old boy\u2019s underwear is probably going to be disgusting. I\u2019d be pissed if my kid was walking around like that for four days.", "> How is telling a kid to not wear the same clothes for days straight depraving them of bodily autonomy?\n\nMaybe we read different posts? I didn't see that the uncle told him not to wear different clothes, just that the kid didn't do it. \n\nAm I wrong here? It changes my view of things if the uncle would not allow clean clothes. \n\n> but he should at least change his clothes which pick up germs and bacteria from wherever literally whatever he goes near\n\nUnless you're hanging around someone who is immune compromised, that's not even worth thinking about.\n\nAn aunt or uncle is in a unique position to act as a friend, a confidant, a mentor or whatever is needed. A kid does not always need a parent, and there's a big benefit to hanging out with a cool uncle who won't sweat the small stuff. Someone for whom looking for learning opportunities, and parenting moments isn't the main focus.\n\nLet a kid be a kid. We don't know what went on, only this side of the story. Maybe the uncle raised an eyebrow and said, \"hey if you wear the same clothes all week you're going to get pretty stinky\" and left it at that.\n\nAnd that's fine, because a kid needs to learn that 4 day old clothes can be pretty stinky, but that it's not a disaster.", "Okay, sure, he should\u2019ve known, but he didn\u2019t. The kid wasn\u2019t in danger. All OP had to say was \u201cplease make sure he showers and changes in the future\u201d. Banning him from seeing the kids is an insanely disproportionate response. Especially when OP admits they sent the kid without any underwear on, seems a bit hypocritical to start pointing fingers about who\u2019s \u201cgross\u201d.", "I haven\u2019t said any of that but go off I guess\u2026 it\u2019s not hard, but clearly uncle just didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t do anything malicious, or dangerous. He knows now. And OP sent the kid without underwear on so it\u2019s a bit hypocritical for them to be pointing the \u201cthat\u2019s gross\u201d finger at the uncle. A kids routine being broken by a few days away with a \u201cfun\u201d family member isn\u2019t the end of the world, and is actually a pretty important part of their social development.", "\ud83d\ude2c No nice way to say this, not all nine year olds have that type of hygiene problem.", "What does \u201cmomo\u201d mean?", "I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust someone with my kid for an extended time after that. It\u2019s just very neglectful and shows a lack of common knowledge.", "Lol it means moron"]}
