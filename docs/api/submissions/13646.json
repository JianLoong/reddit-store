Is regular showering, which I support, really worth losing a uncle who is willing to take kiddo for four days? Really don't think uncle would abide by a daily shower rule? Not telling you how to feel, just pointing out a family member who is willing/able to do a 4 day road trip is a rarity. Guess, question is kinda where would they shower? Cause this really feels like an old school road trip if the only shower was at the pool.", "I mean, \"asshole\" is too strong of a word, but I do think you're overreacting. NAH.\n\nBeing a boy has nothing to do with it. When you go on some trips, bathing isn't really the highest priority (especially for someone who hasn't hit puberty yet and isn't a sweaty stankball of hormones). My family camped a lot when I was his age and I would go several days without showering.\n\nBesides, a lot of adults don't shower every day and only address the \"important\" stuff like brushing their teeth. If the only thing you have to worry about is the kid coming back smelling like a Florida swamp in the summer, I'd call that a win.", "I don't anyone here is an AH, but I do think you're over reacting. I would be more mad that he hadn't changed his underwear for 4 days. But I wouldn't keep him from his uncle for that, I'd just burn the underwear he came home in!", "I\u2019m so confused but these comments. Like y\u2019all are comfortable and justifying that a child hasn\u2019t taken a shower for days is okay. That\u2019s concerning and he was in the care of his uncle. The uncle should\u2019ve made sure he was taking care of his nephew hygiene. To say he\u2019s just being a boy, is feeding him the wrong thing and breeds the behavior of having poor hygiene is good.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but you are overreacting. I\u2019d be more upset that my son didn\u2019t change his clothes than not having showered for a few days. However, I wouldn\u2019t restrict my sibling from seeing the kid unsupervised ever again for it.

Especially when their at-home routines are missing. Professionals know this and we take extra care to help facilitate good hygiene. Your brother isn't a professional and probably acted the same way at this age. \n\nYour kid came home stinky but happy. I agree there is room for improvement in how your brother managed this but that should just be a conversation along the lines of ' thank you so much for taking my kid on a wonderful experience, can you please make sure he showers a couple times, and changes his clothes regularly because he's young and needs to be reminded.'", "NTA. He's 9. This is right around the age where parents start teaching kids about hygiene. Double check with your son about brushing his teeth.

You could just tell your brother that next time he gets a shower after a couple of days.  You BATHED a 9 year old ?   Was it to punish him?   You sound controlling and awful.  This should be a 2 situation and not a 10 problem.", "YTA. That's a huge overreaction. He wasn't in danger", "Not showering for 4 days is not a problem.\n\nI've been on sailing trips of several weeks where the only water we saw was salt water.

A lot.\n\nThe only thing I do have a problem with is the book b chief underwear. And that one is on your son. At nine he's old enough to know he needs to put on clean underwear every day and that includes socks. \n\nNext time give proper instructions to your brother. If you feel that your child has to shower at least every two days, then tell the caretaker that beforehand. You really can't expect them to read your mind.\n\n\nSo for the simple fact that you are punishing your brother for not being able to read your mind.

He\u2019s 9 he\u2019s old enough to listen to you. I also think it\u2019s weird that you had to shower him twice when he got home. My kids are old, but at 9 they we\u2019re definitely showering by themselves.", "Yes, YTA. The answer to that is no more unsupervised trips; not no access. If they went camping this would be shrugged off. And while I question your brother's hygiene, he took care of the teeth.", "YTA. Do you have any idea how lucky you are to have a sibling who wants to spend that much dedicated time with your son? This just sounds like when I would go to summer camp every year and come back absolutely disgusting. He had a unique fun experience that was a little bit of a break from normal expectations. No harm came to him, he bonded with his uncle and had a great time. And you want to deprive him of that going forward because he got a little dirty. It\u2019s extremely distasteful.", "NTA? I question it a little bit because, it feels like somewhat of an overreaction and stopping something that your kid probably really enjoys.\n\nLike what was stopping you from just saying \"bro look, you may not shower every day, but he needs to.\"\n\nIf he then pushes back on that THEN its a definite NTA.\n\nBut i'd feel for the kid and at least TRY to rectify the situation", "Unless your son was actually rolling around in the mud or otherwise doing something particularly dirty, I think you are over reacting. Four days without a bath are not a big deal for a boy.

NAH", "NTA was this a camping road trip or were they staying somewhere indoors in between days? If it was camping I could understand the not showering, but not even changing clothes? That I can't understand. I would maybe restrict just overnight/multiple visits if he disagrees strongly with these hygiene standards.", "YTA the only real concern is the lack of underwear change, which you could have tackled within going full nuclear\nPrepubescent kids don't need to wash as much as adults", "YTA. Yeah, it was irresponsible to not make the kid shower, but it\u2019s also not a big deal in the whole scheme of things. This isn\u2019t something that I would ruin an uncle-nephew relationship over. Just set some ground rules for next time that if he has any overnights, he must shower once a day. If he doesn\u2019t, then no more unsupervised visits.", "YTA Guys (young AND old) can be gross. They were male bonding and the kid brushed his teeth daily. It would be better if next time you asked your brother to make sure your son showers and changes his clothes regularly. \n\nYou totally overreacted and should apologize to your brother. Be thankful you have a sibling who cares about your son so much and wants to spend time with him.", "NTA. Ask your brother if he washes his ass while showering. I might know the answer already", "NTA - I wouldn't leave a child with your brother either.", "Seems like you\u2019re overreacting, but I\u2019ll say NAH", "NTA, you are the parent, it's your decision. I will say tho, I know people who go camping off the grid for 3-5 days at a time without showering. I know people who go camping at campgrounds with showers, but don't shower while they are there. I'm not saying he was right, like I said, it's your call. Personally I wouldn't be able to go that long, but this isn't about me.", "YTA. Your son is 9 years old, not 3 years old. \n>\nGoing 4 days without showering (especially if they\u2019re swimming etc) isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n>\nYou should be thanking your brother for the trip, instead of threatening that he can\u2019t see his nephew.

You're mad at the wrong person. Your child is 9. That's old enough to know that he should change his clothes and bathe regularly.

In the grand scheme of things, no one was hurt and this isn\u2019t a big deal. Do you know what is a big deal? Your son\u2019s relationship with his uncle. You need to go fix this.", "YTA: Kids like to not shower for a while I remember when I was that way. Your brother can\u2019t force your son to shower or wear different clothes.

A shower sure feels good, especially after climbing a mountain and applying layers of sunscreen, but skipping a shower doesn\u2019t make one sick. It just makes one stink.\n\nNot saying it would be ok to have a kid not shower for 4 days, I really don\u2019t know how dirty kids get and what skipping a shower does to their hygiene training, I would probably ask and respect what the parents think is necessary.

However, as you say, he had access to those things and chose not to. Your failure to instill your personal hygiene standards in your child is not your brother's fault.\n\n Your brother made sure your kid did the actually important stuff, like brushing his teeth.

Why are you taking this from your son?", "So your 9 year old was raised to not have common sense and your brother is the one to blame for that?", "For non-parents, I'm not sure it is. I'm 40, female and childfree. If I were to take one of my similarly aged niblings for a few days, I'd have no clue how often or even how to go about having them bathe. I don't even really know how often kids that age are supposed to bathe. I'd also wonder if the kid can wash themself, do they take a shower or a bath, etc. I mean, I personally would probably *ask* the kids parents prior to the trip but I could also understand forgetting to ask. \n\nI don't think your brother was malicious, negligent or cruel, just clueless. And saying he can't see your kid anymore is pretty harsh for a silly mistake. \n\nYTA.", "Okay, so\u2026was he a LOT dirty? Or \u201cperfectly clean?\u201d I\u2019m lost.", "Why would your brother think your child needed assistance to bathe? If you had to bathe your child because the smell and dirt didn't bother him, that's a big asked for someone who doesn't have kids, and something you need to tell people. Most kids can shower on their own by 9.", "Hm. My nine year old knew how to wash his hands without being prompted. Sounds like a parenting issue.", "And you think that justifies him not being with his uncle unsupervised anymore? Is there a reason why you skipped past \u201chey can you make sure he showers next time\u201d and went straight to I don\u2019t trust you with my child? There was CLEARLY no ill intent, your child had a good time and your brother did too. What if they had been camping for 4 days? Probably wouldn\u2019t be showering every day then either. Would you have had the same reaction?", "So you throw him in the bath and there's no problem anymore? I don't understand how that translates to banning your brother (who was kind enough to take him on a road trip) from ever being alone with him again. \n\nThey were on a road trip, not in a warzone. You act as if it was child endangerment... the kid got a little dirty- so what? You would be acting this way if it was a camping trip where it is perfectly normal to go without a shower for the duration?", "Oh no dirty hands?! He\u2019d never get those playing in the sandbox", "With scouts, it\u2019s seen as an opportunity to exercise some personal responsibility. You could tell your son that on these trips, he\u2019s responsible for his hygiene. The bonus is your brother will be the one subjected to hygiene fails, but it would now be an opportunity rather than a point of contention. Win/win!", "I\u2019m not saying I would call CPS for this, but people are being nonchalant and not reading what OP said. He says that his brother can\u2019t see his son without either him or his mother present, not that he\u2019s banned from seeing his son ever. I think that\u2019s a reasonable boundary to put in place.", "You let your 9 year old go on his first big trip without his parents and you didn't think to talk to his guardian for the trip about things like bathing? My man, that is on you. \n\nHow did you not go over stuff like that before the trip? If I leave my kids with my in-laws for a *single night* I go through the entire bed-time routine and tell them a ton of extra shit they don't even need to know just to be safe.", "Why did you have to bathe your son? He's 9. Couldn't he do it himself?", "If you had to take his clothes down to the creek and wash them by hand, I\u2019d feel for you. But I\u2019m assuming a laundry machine was involved, so meh.", "Washing his clothes twice?  Why?  Because he wore them for four days.\n\nYou're overreacting with this alone.\n\nYTA", "Why did you wash his clothes twice, though? Were the clothes he was wearing really *that* bad or do you maybe have some kind of cleanliness obsession? Bc you seem so upset about this but in your comments say that he, your son, came home clean, he just hadn\u2019t changed his clothes. What are you really upset about? Are you jealous that your son has more fun with your brother than you? It seems like there may be deeper issues.", "you're gonna be able to smell it after awhile of ppl not wearing underwear", "I'm not the OP but ok", "So you\u2019re trying to tell me that an ADULT doesn\u2019t know that a kid should have AT LEAST 1 shower in 4 days\u2026. Fr?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Are you serious right now\n\nYou really think an adult somehow doesn't know a child shouldn't wear the same clothes for a fucking week", "You can always tell those with bad hygiene. Did the brother also not bathe for 5 days on this trip?", "Ah the learned helplessness brigade has arrived. It\u2019s not rocket science to understand a kid needs to bathe every couple of days. It\u2019s not like they went camping FFS. OP, NTA. \n\nHow do these of you defending OP\u2019s brother even get through an average day lol.", "Right? Throw the kids in the bath and go about your day? This is such a non-issue especially for a one-time trip. \n\nA gentle reminder that next time some more clothing changes/showers would be expected and that's all you need really. Instead OP went DEFCON 1 and banned his brother, who was kind enough to bring him on a special trip, from ever being alone with the kid? Overreaction of the century.", "Then you have a quick chat with you kid about hygiene and what's expected of him and leave at that? No need to go nuclear. \n\nIt doesn't even make sense, if the brother was to spend an hour alone with the kid and take him to the park or something you really think the kid would backslide into a caveman like state? Get real.\n\nI guarantee you what the kid remembers from the trip is having fun with his uncle, being on the road and probably listening to music in the car and stuff. His memories don't revolve exclusively around not bathing.", "It\u2019s not necessary to shower daily if you don\u2019t smell.", "I would never shower daily.\n\nThere is no need at all for that.", "No I'm agreeing with you. I'm also astonished by the comments and adding on to what you're saying. :)", "It's rare, but sometimes people comment to agree \ud83e\udd14", "the boy wasn\u2019t clean, op\u2019s brother was", "bravo. you have a way with words, i can almost smell the crusty 4 day old queso. \n\nanyway, what does that have to do with my comment? kids should be changing their socks and underwear at least once in 4 days. pretty standard stuff, even for camping/road trips.", "What the fuck are you talking about\n\nAn adult or older teen deciding to wear the same shirt for 2 days isn't the same as a 9 year old having to sit in his own stink for 4 days straight with no clean clothes being given to him and not even having underwear either", "Frr and to take an uncle out of a kids life over not changing clothes for 4 days topss", "He should had told him to shower like he did with brushing his teeth.", "9yo vs 35yo. Which one should be the responsible one of the two?", "I\u2019m about the same, I would assume a 9 year old could take care of their own shower/bath? And if they couldn\u2019t or the parent knew they would try to avoid it - I\u2019d get a heads up from the parent. \n\nI\u2019d let them know when it was available (we\u2019re stopping here, there\u2019s showers). But unless they stank or looked super dirty - I wouldn\u2019t push it. I don\u2019t want to argue with a kid about bath time. \n\nBut I\u2019d also never offer to take a child on a road trip because that does not sound like my idea of a fun road trip. I don\u2019t have kids because I don\u2019t want the responsibility, I definitely do not want the responsibility during my fun/down time. \n\nOP is going WAY overboard with the \u201cyou will never be with my kid without it\u2019s parents present again\u201d, that\u2019s not the threat parents seem to think it is for most of us. All I hear is \u201cyou\u2019ll never have the expectation/responsibly of babysitting for free again.\u201d lol maybe that was the brothers goal all along. Haha", "If you have no clue how to keep a child clean, then it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t take them with you for a few days. The uncle in discussion is old enough to know basic hygiene, and he chose to let a child go without a shower and in the same dirty clothes for several days. \nAt the very least, he should\u2019ve changed the kid\u2019s clothes everyday.", "Why would he need help?", "Because it showed a lack of common sense", "It\u2019s a ludicrous boundary considering there\u2019s nothing wrong with a 9 year old not showering for four days.", "Yeah, this keeps getting weirder. Does she mean she told him to go take a bath, or that she literally bathed him? Because I wonder if the son told Uncle Cool he needed to be hand bathed and Uncle Cool wasn\u2019t comfortable doing that, and that\u2019s why he just had him wash his feet?", "Because it still smelled like onions after the first wash. I even added Lysol disinfectant and scent booster stuff.", "\"a while\", sure, but four days on a pre-pubescent boy? Even so, it's still op's responsibility to teach his kid that. Why wasn't the kid wearing underwear when he left op's house?", "You're making wonder about the brother's hygiene!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude2c", "When I was a kid we had Saturday night bath, hair wash, and hair rolling probably til I hit puberty, but I don\u2019t remember exactly when things changed. I just remember the Saturday night rituals.", "It\u2019s not as wild as you may think. The adult knows they need to shower. But it\u2019s a whole different skill set to make sure another human is showering. Stuff that I think parents take for granted. \n\nAlso four days without a shower won\u2019t kill him. Kids are gross. I\u2019m on team brother. Partly because an unbathed 9yo in a car is its own punishment", "I\u2019ve been a preteen counselor for summer camps for several years & we had to be on top of it everyday to make sure the kids took showers & changed clothes, especially with the boys", "Sadly I have learned common sense is taught not common.\n\nSource: 2 boys who fight me on daily underpants changing, teeth brushing and general well being. \n\"I did that yesterday....\"", "For sure. It's also a perfect example of natural consequences, which is the holy grail of parenting. \"Oh! you didn't shower or change clothes for four days! How does your body feel right now? A little gross? Shower sound good?\"\n\nAnd then next time (or eventually) he's away for a couple days, he remembers that he feels really fucking disgusting if he doesn't shower for 4 days, and makes the decision *himself* to shower.", "It also sounds like there was swimming involved on some days. While not a long term substitute for a good shower, it could get the surface grime off at least. I would\u2019ve thought it was four weeks from the drastic action.", "Don\u2019t have any kids. Too young to be a mother. \n\nYou missed my whole point. Who said anything an hour or even 10 minutes. If you were smart, I\u2019m referring into where the nephew stays with uncle at days at a time whether it\u2019s a road trip or staying over at his place. That\u2019s merely it. If you didn\u2019t get that then oh well.", "And if the kid smelled bad the uncle would probably have noticed, especially being cooped up in the car with him.", "You know daily applies differently to everyone right? Whatever your interpretation of daily is then that\u2019s you.", "Oh, thank you then. My fault then.", "I think she said in a comment that the boy was clean, just she thought his clothes smelled like onions. Idk I\u2019m confused now.", "Hey, I'm saving that queso for later.", "I'm fascinated by your perspective... So, in your mind, the uncle was holding the kid's suitcase hostage and actually disallowing him from changing?\n\nI dunno what kind of beige couch helicopter family dynamic you're used to, but the kid is 9 years old, nearly a tween - far old enough to manage his own suitcase and dress himself. This was probably the kid's decision... Either out of laziness or he was distracted by having a fun time and just grabbed whatever he took off. I'd be surprised if the uncle even noticed what he was wearing at all and likely had no idea the kid was recycling because he probably isn't a parent himself and isn't adapted to that level of micromanagement.", "Do you know he didn't?", "We have to force our 9 year old boy to change his clothes and shower.  He doesn\u2019t do it willingly.  Maybe the kid pushed back and your brother didn\u2019t want to force him?", "That is not irony, just FWIW", "Not making a child shower is not irresponsible. You should be teaching your own child to be responsible for his hygiene.", "Exactly. Your son didn't see a problem with being dirty.", "You serious? You know what is a lack of common sense? Not talking to the person who will be watching your kid for 4 days about what you expect from them on the trip. As a parent, not communicating how often they should have a shower or when they should change their clothes. This, my friend, shows a lack of common sense. Your son is 9, and you let him go on a trip with someone without even making sure you were on the same page with them. That, if anything, shows a lack of common sense.\n\nIf someone says they are going on a road trip I equate that to kind of like camping. It's expecting you might not have all the amenities or be as clean as you would be at home.\n\nIf anyone is showing a lack of common sense here it's you.", "What\u2019s crazy about it? He still gets to see his nephew. The kid is his parents\u2019 responsibility. This isn\u2019t an abusive parent separating a child from a safe adult. These are parents with a reasonable expectation that their son will shower and change his clothes AT SOME POINT on this trip.

I want answers.", "Uncle Cool \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude02", "You washed his clothes in Lysol? That seems weird to me.", "The more details I see the more grossed out I am. Your son could get seriously sick. Covid is destroying kids immune systems. He couldn\u2019t even get this kid to wash his hands? Scarlet fever is rampant in children right now. Washing his hands should be second nature by now with the amount of public messaging.\n\nEdit: here\u2019s an article from NIH showing a Covid infection can cause similar damage to immune system as HIV. We\u2019ve been in a strep A emergency since December and more kids have died this year than the last 10 years combined. We have more hospitalization now than in \u201822 and \u201821.

I wouldn't feel comfortable physically washing a 9 year old either because to me that's old enough to do it themselves and they deserve privacy (outside of disability of course). \n\nIDK, just seems strange to me that a 9 year old wouldn't wash or change clothes on their own. Outside of disability/neurodivergence they should be fully capable of understanding and completing basic hygiene.", "Is your kid not able to clean himself?
