How old is your brother? He might need a bit more instructions on the do's and don't's of traveling with a 9YO, including making sure that they shower regularly and wear clean clothes.", "NAH, sure he should've been showering but you're definitely overreacting if you don't want your brother to see your son over it. just set the expectation that you want him to shower.", "NAH. Is regular showering, which I support, really worth losing a uncle who is willing to take kiddo for four days? Really don't think uncle would abide by a daily shower rule? Not telling you how to feel, just pointing out a family member who is willing/able to do a 4 day road trip is a rarity. Guess, question is kinda where would they shower? Cause this really feels like an old school road trip if the only shower was at the pool.", "I mean, \"asshole\" is too strong of a word, but I do think you're overreacting. NAH.\n\nBeing a boy has nothing to do with it. When you go on some trips, bathing isn't really the highest priority (especially for someone who hasn't hit puberty yet and isn't a sweaty stankball of hormones). My family camped a lot when I was his age and I would go several days without showering.\n\nBesides, a lot of adults don't shower every day and only address the \"important\" stuff like brushing their teeth. If the only thing you have to worry about is the kid coming back smelling like a Florida swamp in the summer, I'd call that a win.", "I don't anyone here is an AH, but I do think you're over reacting. I would be more mad that he hadn't changed his underwear for 4 days. But I wouldn't keep him from his uncle for that, I'd just burn the underwear he came home in!", "I\u2019m so confused but these comments. Like y\u2019all are comfortable and justifying that a child hasn\u2019t taken a shower in 4 days is okay. That\u2019s concerning and he was in the care of his uncle. The uncle should\u2019ve made sure he was taking care of his nephew hygiene. To say he\u2019s just being a boy, is feeding him the wrong thing and breeds the behavior of having poor hygiene is good.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but you are overreacting. I\u2019d be more upset that my son didn\u2019t change his clothes than not having showered for a few days. However, I wouldn\u2019t restrict my sibling from seeing the kid unsupervised ever again for it. He was cared for, fed, and some hygiene was taken care of on a daily basis.", "YWBTA - I've worked at summer camps with children for a long time and you'd be shocked at how many 5 to 18-year olds don't change, shower or take care of their personal hygiene without explicit reminders. Especially when their at-home routines are missing. Professionals know this and we take extra care to help facilitate good hygiene. Your brother isn't a professional and probably acted the same way at this age. \n\nYour kid came home stinky but happy. I agree there is room for improvement in how your brother managed this but that should just be a conversation along the lines of ' thank you so much for taking my kid on a wonderful experience, can you please make sure he showers a couple times, and changes his clothes regularly because he's young and needs to be reminded.'", "NTA. He's 9. This is right around the age where parents start teaching kids about hygiene. Double check with your son about brushing his teeth. If he didn't change outfits or shower, I question if teeth were brushed.", "A 9 yo hasn't showered for 4 day?!  Omg call CPS. Yta", " YTA.  It won\u2019t kill a kid to go days without a bath.  You could just tell your brother that next time he gets a shower after a couple of days.  You BATHED a 9 year old ?   Was it to punish him?   You sound controlling and awful.  This should be a 2 situation and not a 10 problem.", "YTA. That's a huge overreaction. He wasn't in danger", "Not showering for 4 days is not a problem.\n\nI've been on sailing trips of several weeks where the only water we saw was salt water. And though that will rinse the dirt of, you do not tell clean.\n\nI've been on camping trips where we only visited a campground with actual showers once a week.\n\n\nYou're overreacting. A lot.\n\nThe only thing I do have a problem with is the book b chief underwear. And that one is on your son. At nine he's old enough to know he needs to put on clean underwear every day and that includes socks. \n\nNext time give proper instructions to your brother. If you feel that your child has to shower at least every two days, then tell the caretaker that beforehand. You really can't expect them to read your mind.\n\n\nSo for the simple fact that you are punishing your brother for not being able to read your mind. YTA", "YTA 4 days isn\u2019t a huge deal imo, if you were that concerned you should have instructed the kid to make sure he showers and changes his clothes everyday. He\u2019s 9 he\u2019s old enough to listen to you. I also think it\u2019s weird that you had to shower him twice when he got home. My kids are old, but at 9 they we\u2019re definitely showering by themselves.", "Yes, YTA. The answer to that is no more unsupervised trips; not no access. If they went camping this would be shrugged off. And while I question your brother's hygiene, he took care of the teeth.", "YTA. Do you have any idea how lucky you are to have a sibling who wants to spend that much dedicated time with your son? This just sounds like when I would go to summer camp every year and come back absolutely disgusting. He had a unique fun experience that was a little bit of a break from normal expectations. No harm came to him, he bonded with his uncle and had a great time. And you want to deprive him of that going forward because he got a little dirty. It\u2019s extremely distasteful.", "NTA? I question it a little bit because, it feels like somewhat of an overreaction and stopping something that your kid probably really enjoys.\n\nLike what was stopping you from just saying \"bro look, you may not shower every day, but he needs to.\"\n\nIf he then pushes back on that THEN its a definite NTA.\n\nBut i'd feel for the kid and at least TRY to rectify the situation", "Unless your son was actually rolling around in the mud or otherwise doing something particularly dirty, I think you are over reacting. Four days without a bath are not a big deal for a boy. If you have other expectations, just make sure your brother is aware of exactly what you want, and it doesn\u2019t seem like there would be a problem. NAH", "NTA was this a camping road trip or were they staying somewhere indoors in between days? If it was camping I could understand the not showering, but not even changing clothes? That I can't understand. I would maybe restrict just overnight/multiple visits if he disagrees strongly with these hygiene standards.", "YTA the only real concern is the lack of underwear change, which you could have tackled within going full nuclear\nPrepubescent kids don't need to wash as much as adults", "YTA. Yeah, it was irresponsible to not make the kid shower, but it\u2019s also not a big deal in the whole scheme of things. This isn\u2019t something that I would ruin an uncle-nephew relationship over. Just set some ground rules for next time that if he has any overnights, he must shower once a day. If he doesn\u2019t, then no more unsupervised visits.", "YTA Guys (young AND old) can be gross. They were male bonding and the kid brushed his teeth daily. It would be better if next time you asked your brother to make sure your son showers and changes his clothes regularly. \n\nYou totally overreacted and should apologize to your brother. Be thankful you have a sibling who cares about your son so much and wants to spend time with him.", "NTA. Ask your brother if he washes his ass while showering. I might know the answer already", "NTA - I wouldn't leave a child with your brother either.", "Seems like you\u2019re overreacting, but I\u2019ll say NAH", "NTA, you are the parent, it's your decision. I will say tho, I know people who go camping off the grid for 3-5 days at a time without showering. I know people who go camping at campgrounds with showers, but don't shower while they are there. I'm not saying he was right, like I said, it's your call. Personally I wouldn't be able to go that long, but this isn't about me.", "YTA. Your son is 9 years old, not 3 years old. \n>\nGoing 4 days without showering (especially if they\u2019re swimming etc) isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n>\nYou should be thanking your brother for the trip, instead of threatening that he can\u2019t see his nephew. (Although this is a great way to get your son to hate you if that is the goal.).", "It's pretty gross. NTA\n\nI probably wouldn't have told him, I just wouldn't have let it get into the situation where he would be taking him. If it came to a point, that's when you could have said, \"After he came back last time without having changed for the entire time I don't think you need to take him.\"", "You're NTA but you're overreacting. You're mad at the wrong person. Your child is 9. That's old enough to know that he should change his clothes and bathe regularly. I'm a married adult with no kids but routinely look after nieces and nephews etc. If they don't do these basic hygiene things on their own I'm not going to force them, I'm not their parent. \n\nIf they're at the age where they're able to have free thoughts, have sleepovers and be away from mommy and daddy they should know how to do these things.\n\nRemember, just because you stand over your child and tell them what to do every 5 minutes doesn't mean that someone else is going to.", "YTA. In the grand scheme of things, no one was hurt and this isn\u2019t a big deal. Do you know what is a big deal? Your son\u2019s relationship with his uncle. You need to go fix this.", "YTA: Kids like to not shower for a while I remember when I was that way. Your brother can\u2019t force your son to shower or wear different clothes. If you\u2019re concerned about it maybe try and talk to your son. No sense driving a wedge between your son and your brother as your son might resent you for it down the road.", "YTA \n\nIs he in scouts? Just wait until he comes back from a week at camp.   Yes,  your brother could've made sure he showered and changed his clothes,  but this is not worth causing a rift in your family.   Don't sweat the small stuff!", "NTA apparently unpopular but I think a 35 year old man should understand kids need to bathe. I assume your brother isn\u2019t bathing too. That\u2019s just nasty to me sorry \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Esh that's extreme maybe to don't let him go on a road trip for multiple days.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
