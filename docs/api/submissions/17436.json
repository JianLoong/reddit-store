Some people thought they were at a memorial. I remarked it was their last school event and it's brave for teen boys to cry.\n\nSomehow my son found out which is odd because he never checks our family's IG or my Facebook.

It's reasonable to assume that he wouldn't want them on Facebook if he didn't want them on Instagram. \n\nIf you want to show him later in life, that doesn't have to involve making the photos publicly available. And, you can show his siblings without posting it publicly either.", "YTA.\n\nThe picture is of your son. He is a person. He is not a prop. If he doesn't want you to post his picture, you should not post his picture.\n\nI'm a parent too. And you know what? I don't post pictures of my kids without their consent. They are humans with feelings, not props I can use to teach other people lessons or show how awesome I am.\n\nHave you ever considered that it might be more important to teach your kids about the value of consent? That they have control over their own bodies? That they are allowed to have the space to have an emotional, PRIVATE moment with friends without having their dad use it as an opportunity to show the Internet how awesome and evolved and sensitive he is? Because my dude, you are none of those things. You are prioritizing showing off as a father over your son's feelings.\n\n>I didn't take the pictures off FB because he doesn't go there and didn't specify that. \n\nWow. Just wow. You're an asshole.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t take the pictures \u201cto show him later on in life\u201d, you posted them on social media for likes.", "YTA parents that do this are god awful. You took a picture of your son crying and being vulnerable, then you shared it on Facebook to everyone. What did you want? Attention? This is soooo messed up.", "YTA completely!! You needed to have asked him first!!", "You posted the photos without his permission? YTA.\n\nEven if it\u2019s a simple photo of him smiling at the camera, you should **always** ask if it\u2019s okay. Much less something your son didn\u2019t want you seeing.", "You took photos of your son and his friends and posted them.  He was embarrassed and asked you to take them down.  You made a big deal out of it and left the photos on other social media.  \n\nDo I need to tell you that YTA?", "YTA, he clearly meant for you to delete it everywhere. I know it seems like he's still very young and he is, don't get me wrong, but this could also be used as an important lesson in Consent.", "It\u2019s okay to cry but some people don\u2019t like pictures taken of them or being posted without consent.", "YTA. He\u2019s upset not because you \u201ctook a photo for him to cherish later in life\u201d, but because of your lack of respect for his privacy when you posted the photo on social media without his consent. This is common courtesy.", "YTA... why would you take a photo of this? It's a changing moment in his life; put down the camera. You should have asked him first too, consent is necessary to take a photo of him and you walked all over that. Why would you take a photo of your son, in a vulnerable state, and post it on Instagram?? YTA. Apologize to him, and make it up to him.\n\nEdit:\n\nI didn't take the pictures off FB because he doesn't go there and didn't specify that.\n\nSo you are now complying to the minimum extent to what he wants? YTA again", "YTA. Don\u2019t post pictures of people without their knowledge and consent. If you do and they don\u2019t like it for any reason, take it down.

Not force his to be shown to everyone.", "YTA for posting pics of your son without his permission, especially if such an emotional moment.", "YTA He was having a vulnerable, personal moment and you shared it with the entire world. \u201cSomehow my son found out\u2026\u201d I\u2019m sure some family member probably contacted him directly. You violated his personal privacy.  You \u201cdumped\u201d the photos on social media without any context, so I find it hard to believe they meant that much. That is something a stranger would do, not a parent. Then you shame him for wanting the pictures removed. Not removing the pictures from Facebook is also an AH move. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say Facebook,\u201d is a juvenile excuse.", "WOW.  YTA,  just for your responses to the posts below.  Why did you post here if clearly you so strongly feel like you did nothing wrong?  Did the crying pics of your son on Social media not give you enough attention that you need even more on here?  Just sad.  Get a life of your own, stop living for attention from the internet.", "YTA. While your intent was benign, as soon as your son let you know it wasn't ok, you should've apologized and removed the photos from your social media.

They aren\u2019t your possessions. You have no right to post photos of them without their permission.", "YTA - Your post was intrusive and wrong. It's not his job to be told what to teach his younger brothers. You did not extend minimal respect by asking him if these photos can be posted and the joke of 'deleting' them from FB means they will always be there.  Read up on posting ethics and courtesies; you are way out of touch. You owe him a big apology.  Taking the picture for him to see was fine, posting it was disrespectful to him and everyone in the image(s).", "YTA, it\u2019s really uncool to take a picture of someone crying in an emotional moment without his consent.", "YTA.   I remember crying at my high school graduation with my head bowed, then seeing a flash and realizing the photographer the school had hired was on his knees on the floor taking a picture of my crying face.  It's been decades and I still get furious when I think about it.   It's horrible to realize someone took advantage of a moment when you were vulnerable to memorialize it for their own reasons.   And then to post it on social media without their permission?  If I were your child, I'd already be planning to go no contact.    \n\n\nOF COURSE it is ok for teenagers--no matter their gender--to cry.  But it's not ok for parents to take pictures of their children in vulnerable moments and share them without permission.", "YTA. It has nothing to do with if he's crying or not. \n\nIt's one thing to post family photos, it's entirely different to post pictures of your kid with his friends without their consent. His friends probably don't want you sharing photos of them online either. That's creepy and bizarre. Take those photos off Facebook immediately.\n\nMy parents would NEVER have done something like this. They'd have given me the photos to let me share with my friends and we'd decide if they should go on social media or not.", "YTA.  That was a vulnerable moment between your son and his friends.  You should have asked all of them if they were okay with the photos being posted online.  Even if in the past your son has not cared about posted photos, this time he did care and you should have removed them from all social media sites when he requested you do so.", "YTA, a big one, specially if you're saying that you don't need his permission to post pictures of him because \"he lives in your house\".\n\nWhat an asshole", "YTA. Your son is graduating, and this was a very intimate, emotional moment. He\u2019s not a toddler running around the house saying something cute that you can show your friends. \n\nGoing forward, you need to understand that he\u2019s an adult now and, as such, that you need his permission before you post photos of him online. Just as, I assume, you would get from a friend or coworker. It\u2019s what I do for my adult kids. \n\nTake the pictures down and apologize. Sheesh.", "YTA. If you truly took them because you saw it as a \"special moment\" and wanted to show them to him \"later in life,\" then why in the world would you post them to your social media??? Not every special moment needs to be shared with the world-- especially when it isn't your moment to share.", "YTA\u2026if you want to teach your younger sons may be post pics of yourself crying.\n\nAll your teaching now is that they need not respect consent, parents like you are the reason why there are men who don\u2019t respect the concept of consent. It\u2019s the same as people posting personal images sent to them while in a relationship. \n\nAnd looking at your comments he does not need to ask your consent to use your washing machine or dryer coz that\u2019s your legal responsibility as a parent. You chose to have him but unfortunately he had no choice with you being his father.", "You sound very emotionally abusive to your kids like the hell", "Take the freaking pics of Facebook. You said you took these as a remembrance for him \"later in life\". He has made it clear he doesn't want them on social media that includes Facebook. Don't be that intrusive \"my wants are more important than yours dad\".\n\nYTA\n\nEdit; it's the dad who is the AH not the mom - sorry mom.", "Wow YTA and a complete arrogant narcissistic d\\*ck.\n\nYou have violated the privacy of both your son and his friends by taking pictures of them in a vulnerable position and posting on social media for your own satisfaction.\n\nAnd you seem to take satisfaction in the fact that you tricked your son into believing that you had listen and responded to his concerns.  Thats a great lesson you are teaching your 9 and 13 yo - thats its ok to lie and trick people (especially family) to get what you want. \n\nYou are a total a\\*s and I imagine this isn't the first time nor will it be the last that you and your son will butt heads - he appears to be more mature and has more morals than you.

It seems more like you're the type of person that likes holding stuff over people's heads... \n\nI was thinking of a dad taking a picture of his kid crying from the joy of graduating and the sadness that some amazing years are behind him now and that may be the case since people aren't all black and white... But if you're the kind of person that likes to make your family feel like lesser beings because you make the money then you have to understand why he'd be apprehensive of you taking a picture like that.\n\nYou can try to stop being an asshole at any time if you want to.
