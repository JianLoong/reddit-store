Since my husband (M32s) parents have gotten older and moved into a smaller house we\u2019ve been hosting Christmas which we\u2019ve been doing for about the past three years. My personal family is very toxic and I went no contact shortly before I met my now husband so I\u2019ve always spent holidays with just his family. They have made me feel very welcome and I\u2019m 100% grateful for that and love them all very much so I do not want to sound like I\u2019m not. We recently welcomed our first child and turned our old guest room into her nursery. My husbands sister her husband and their two kids who are 4 and 7 years old live out of state and always flew in for christmas and would stay in our guest room. 2 weeks before Christmas she messaged me saying she was excited to meet her niece and asked if she would be staying in our room so her and her family could all fit in the guest bedroom. I figured that she would\u2019ve understood that we wanted them to stay in a hotel because we didn\u2019t have room. Their kids are also very rowdy and I didn\u2019t want them around the baby a lot either but that\u2019s just me being paranoid. None of the other family near by have big enough houses for them to stay in so I explained that we would like if they got a hotel room because we had no room. She called me angry telling me she wanted to be around family because that\u2019s what Christmas is about and if she stays in a hotel room that\u2019s us shutting her out and we should be able to easily move the baby into our room so they could stay with us but I refused. She talked shit on me to my husbands whole side of the family and told them I\u2019m selfish my making them stay in a hotel and we were atrocious hosts. The cherry on top was her refusing to come to Christmas altogether saying if her family weren\u2019t welcome they wouldn\u2019t bother coming. I felt like she was acting crazy about the whole thing but my husband and his side of the family agreed with her. My husband told me that we should just move the baby into our room to avoid the hassle but at this point I refused saying if she wanted to act like a baby because she had to stay in a hotel I didn\u2019t want her here anyway. No one else came to Christmas and called me selfish for not letting her stay in our home. I feel like this blew way out of proportion.

That extra expense at Christmas time would be hard for many families.", "I'm confused.  If you turned your guestroom into a nursery, I am assuming the only bed in there would be the crib or maybe a daybed.  Most bedrooms aren't large enough to hold a crib, changing table, chest of drawers, and a rocking chair plus a bed that would be large enough for a couple to sleep in.  What did your SIL think she would be sleeping in - the crib?   This is crazy!  Everyone should have realized that new accommodations would have to be arranged now that you no longer have a guest room so maybe you have some responsibility here.  But so did all your ILs.  You are a new mom so NTA for not have realizing there might be an issue sooner.", "NTA-She has children she should understand things change when you have children instead of acting like a child herself.", "NTA\n\nYou had a child. Your situation has changed and you no longer have the additional room. It is ok to say no. Perhaps this was a communication issue. If they stay with you every year, then it should have been expressly communicated well before Christmas that you would not be able to host them this year because of the baby. If the first time you told them that they would not be staying with you was two weeks before Christmas, then I get why they were upset -  a last minute hotel during the holiday season can be a huge unplanned expense. Their reaction was still way over the top and excessive but holiday expectations should have been communicated well in advance.", "NTA.  Perfectly acceptable to set boundaries for your home and baby.  Sounds like you should have aligned with your husband first.", "INFO: how many bedrooms do you have in your house? Does the nursery even have an adult-sized bed in it anymore?", "UPDATE\n\nThank you for all your feedback, I didn\u2019t expect this many comments so fast haha. I agree with a lot of you that I could\u2019ve handled this a little better and let my husband weigh in more I am definitely going to talk to my SIL and the rest of my in laws about why they couldn\u2019t stay and work out a situation for next Christmas. Possibly paying for them to stay in a hotel I feel as if could work or having them sleep in the living room if that was okay were definite solutions I overlooked things have been very stressful as my baby\u2019s only four months old so sleep schedules have been wacky whilst also trying to plan a whole Christmas I think the stress got to me. So once again thanks for the feedback your all very kind.", "NTA. Your sister is for assuming she will have the room and when she ASKS and you tell her NO, she then has a tantrum over it. It's not her house so it's not her choice and she waited 2 weeks before Christmas to ask new parents if they can stay at your house.", "NTA. Not sure how any sane person here is saying YTA. It\u2019s your house, your baby, your decision. Although this should have been discussed with your husband and handled differently.", "ESH.  Obviously SIL.  You should have discussed it with your husband first.", "NTA \n\nThe room used in previous years is no longer available. You don\u2019t have a guest room anymore. They need to find other accommodations.", "NTA. Regardless of what happened in previous years SIL isn't entitled to a room in your house.", "ESH\n\nYou for waiting until 2 weeks before Christmas to be sure they knew they\u2019d have to stay in a hotel. By which point even if they were willing to there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019 would have been difficult if not impossible to find a decent affordable hotel.\n\nShe sucks for bad mouthing you to everyone in your husband\u2019s family.", "NTA  In hindsight, it might have been a good idea to send a note letting them know things for Christmas would have to change this year, due to the baby's arrival.  However, no one should have been caught off-guard or upset about it.\n\nIt's your home and your family.  Settling in at home into a routine with a new baby is exhausting and stressful, at times.  I agree with you, 100%.  Switching her room and upsetting her routine isn't good for her OR mom and dad.  If his family can't understand that, tough noogies.  Alternate plans should have been made.  Getting a hotel room for their family is no big deal, and they are the selfish ones for not being more flexible with plans...they KNOW what it's like with a new baby!", "ESH your SIL worse than you. But seriously, you just expected her to know there was no room for her when they had always stayed with you in the past? When you invited them would have been the time to say that you no longer had a guest bedroom and they would need to make other arrangements. She should not have assumed and her reaction was way uncalled for. And I find it hard to believe that no one else that lives around you couldn\u2019t fit them in.

Do you even have a bed in the nursery?", "YTA. This could\u2019ve been avoided if you upfront told her that this year there is no room. I don\u2019t think it unreasonable to ask her to stay in a hotel, but this was handled wrong.", "NTA \n\nThis sort of happened to me when I had my first baby. People make note when you have a guest bedroom and they get a little silly when they have to find new accommodations. I remember my younger SIL sending me an out of town uncle when my husband was out of town and my baby was 2 months old. I told her that we don\u2019t have a guest room anymore BUT that she did. You take the weird out of town uncle! \n\nI was very glad not to have extra room.

Four people  will not fit in a crib.  3- tell her to bring sleeping bags and pillows because the living room couch is all you've got. I realize you say they are rambunctious  but you left this so late that at least this year you should  have sucked it up.", "NTA Other family could have made room for her also. I wouldn't want that shit stirrer staying with me. You have a new baby, and no longer have a guest room. It also makes sense not to have rowdy kids around interrupting the babies routine.

What an entitled cow.\n\nEdit- you are not responsible for paying for their hotel room. Good Lord, your husband needs to grow a spine.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a kid now, it\u2019s different.

Your child has to be considered and that isn\u2019t being selfish or unwelcoming.  I don\u2019t think it was unreasonable to suggest a hotel nearby that sil and her fam could stay at.  The fact your husband\u2019s family chose sides and skipped Christmas is a concern because if they\u2019ll turn something so small into such a huge deal, you may need to rethink how and under what conditions you\u2019ll interact with them or expose your child to them.  They seem like inconsiderate drama-lamas.  \n\nI would take time to address them once (like at one time either in person or via a group chat) and explain you weren\u2019t saying sil was uninvited, just that you didn\u2019t have the space since your family size changed and it\u2019s unfortunate that she took you suggesting a hotel room as not wanting her there, but that wasn\u2019t the case.  Also express you\u2019re very disappointed in their reactions as well but you appreciate them letting you know how they view family.

You should have notified her way before 2 weeks to Christmas. Flights and hotels are expensive. \n\n2. Her reaction was horrible.\n\n3.

That\u2019s big room. Most people would understand that 4 humans wouldn\u2019t fit in a nursery full of baby stuff and made other arrangements. \n\nYTA in a small way for not clearing this up earlier.

Apologize, say you have been experiencing lots of stress and weren't thinking clearly.", "YTA for not telling your SIL directly that you were changing things up this year. They are used to staying at your place and though they have no absolute right to do so, it's reasonable that they might expect to continue doing so. Instead you just assumed they would comply with a request you hadn't even passed along, and let it go until mid-December before you told them they had to book a hotel at one of the busiest times of the year for traveling.", "I agree with this, but I also think the sister should have assumed that things will be different this year with a baby in the picture and asked to be sure. I find it somewhat entitled that she automatically assumed the old conditions would still apply.

The assuming makes SIL the AH.", "I don\u2019t think any suggestions OP could have given would have worked. Even if Op had given more time in letting sil know there was no space, the outcome would have been the same. Not only did sil try putting her family above the baby, but also went out of her way to drag other members into the drama and create a hostile situation for OP by turning family against her.  That is hateful and spiteful behaviour and I guarantee sil will need OP long before OP would need her.", "If she handled it wrong, the SIL is mega-entitled to demand to stay in someone else's house, and then to turn the whole family, including her husband against OP. ESH at best. SIL is out of line.", "I\u2019ll be glad not to have guest room anymore also having to host relatives because I was the only one with a big enough house was exhausting.", "You are insane to think someone else has a right to a room in YOUR house that involves moving your child out of their room.", "But she just had a baby, she doesn't need four extra guests.", "OP is not obligated to reconfigure the accommodations in her home for anyone. And, SIL was never entitled to stay in OP\u2019s home. She certainly doesn\u2019t owe anyone an apology.", "So there was quite literally no bed for them! I'm just confused if she knew you had a nursery, then she had to know that you didn't have an extra bedroom anymore... Hence why she was asking if the baby was going to be in with you for those days. Right? \n\nIf we were just talking about a baby it would be one thing, but was sil planning on sleeping in the crib? Did she really expect you to completely restore the room for her to stay there a few days? How would she even know you still had a bed and pull out couch to put in there? Who asks somebody to move furniture for them to stay for free?\n\nThis is a whole lot of \"she didn't prepare even though she knew that you weren't going to have room for her, so now she had to blow up on you to not make it look bad that she didn't plan properly\" You're NTA but let hubby deal with them from now on!", "Sell the bed and pull-out sofa.

She\u2019s not entitled to a damn thing she got too comfortable, and I would put her in her place.", "Depends on the size of tge room and where everything is placed. We live in a townhouse and the nursery for my son was the smallest bedroom. Crib was against the wall, as was tge changing table on the next wall.

His circus his monkeys, even if you like his monkeys.", "ESH. You for not properly communicating well in advance (or better yet, having your husband do so) that you would not be able to host them this year - and for not getting on the same page as the husband ahead of time.

Both sides made assumptions and both sides seem to have handled it poorly.", "Why is it that families so often assume that when someone's life changes, everything will stay the same for THEM? NTA. Your circumstances have changed. So must their plans.", " Wow, your SIL is actually jealous of a baby having its own room? Hard NTA and don't budge whatsoever", "What?! You have no obligation to pay. If SIL were hosting would they pay for your accommodation if there\u2019s no room in their house? Would you think you\u2019re responsible for the gas they need to get to you? I doubt it.

The SIL could've confirmed a lot earlier.  A new mother with a 4 month old who is organising everything for Christmas, does not need to be the one co-ordinating accommodation arrangements.\n\nI'm really not quite sure how entitled SIL is to assume that everything would be the same but then she clearly doesn't remember what it was like for her with the broken nights that come with having an infant.\n\nWhere was SIL planning on sleeping in the baby's room?  In their cot or bassinette?  I'm assuming the full sized bed was removed to fit the nursery furniture.", "It was easy to predict, easy to solve by communication months ago, and nobody did. That is everyone's fault.", "No we didnt. That room was the nursery/baby's room. It was just a walk across the hall from our master bedroom. We had the baby monitor to use. We also had a bottle warmer than also kept a couple bottles cold until ready to use so that alleviated up and down the stairs. When my daughter was born we used the pack n play bassinet in our bedroom due to colic(it was shear hell).", "I have 2 full size beds in my room and could still fit a crib it really does depend on the setup if I didn\u2019t have a walk in closet then yeah I wouldnt have room", "I remember the colic days. Luckily at 5 weeks old my daughter decided she wanted to be in her cot in her own room and refused to sleep in her bassinet haha.", "You were so lucky.

So you were supposed to pack up your baby\u2019s room get everything out of storage so it will be a guest room again, I think not. Your SIL sounds entitled to having things her way and being the center of attention in the family, everything and everyone resolves around her. Your husband has some issues too as well as the rest of the family that didn\u2019t show and called to harass you. I would say you could have suggested other sleeping arrangements like the couch etc, but I truly believe that wouldn\u2019t have been okay for her. You don\u2019t owe anyone apology. You both assumed, with one of you having common sense being you, that since the guest room is now a nursery, that SIL and family will need to make other sleeping arrangements.

But I do think you should of been more clear while inviting them that it\u2019s now a nursery, *not a spare room*", "ESH\n\nI\u2019m confused what kinds of families other people have. When we stay with family, or vice versa, things just get shuffled around to make room. Kids sleep in parents\u2019 room, an office gets an air mattress, etc. No one defaults to assuming they\u2019ll stay at a hotel. You have a new baby and things are out of whack and you\u2019re probably exhausted, so I don\u2019t blame you about wanting them to stay at a hotel. But you shouldn\u2019t have assumed they\u2019d just know and that\u2019s a pretty sizable expense to drop on people at any time, but especially a few weeks before Christmas. And she shouldn\u2019t have put y\u2019all on blast with the family.", "ESH \nYou honestly could have just moved the baby into your room. Everyone is right when it comes to that. When it's Christmas and there's not a lot of room, a lot of families have kids sharing a bed, some ppl on an air mattress. Sometimes the owners of the home will crash on the couch so their parents can have the bed if their place is that small. When it comes to Christmas you make room. It would have been fine for your infant to stay in your room for a bit. \n\nYour SIL blew it wwaaayyy out of proportion. Just because she couldn't stay in your home she's not coming to Christmas? Then trash talks you and gets everyone else to join in? There's nothing wrong with a hotel. \"It's a time for family\" yes, yes it is and you will be with family, just not sleeping in the same house. What she did was uncalled for tbh.", "YTA - there is always ways to fit people in if people have to stay over.  Whether it be beds in the lounge room or a tent outside, there is always ways to make room.  You can rent a caravan for a weekend.  You made this unnecessarily different to how you have celebrated xmas for the last 3 years.", "You have no contact with your family and you just ostracized your husband's family.  What's your end goal here? To spend every holiday alone? You might be in the right, but you will pay the price for your inflexibility anyway.", "But there's still no bed in the room.", "I love going shopping and the kids say hi. I say hi back and the mother says hi too. It makes my day seeing little ones so happy."]}
