Most of us weren't even allowed to date until we were 18. Well my parents have slowly been getting more lenient over the years, especially with younger siblings that have fought back more against their rules. Today, they started a group chat with everyone in the family letting us know that they are moving to the clothing optional community, but we're all still welcome to come visit them.\n\nThe real problem comes in with the fact that all 7 of us are married and most have kids. There are around 12 grandkids total. All the family lives relatively close together (within 30 minutes) and we often bring our kids to our parent's house to play. They all love our parents and have a great time over there. \n\nNow, we can't bring the kids to see their grandparents, or if we did it would be extremely awkward. I have no problem with them living this life, but moving far away from the family to a place that nobody in the family is really comfortable going feels selfish to me. \n\nI haven't told them all of how I feel about it, but it makes me upset that they would basically just leave all their kids and grandkids behind. Why couldn't they just visit the community regularly instead of moving there? Am I the asshole for getting upset about this?\n\nETA - I just want to clarify it's not that they babysit for us.

You're allowed to be upset that your parents, who seem to be active in not only your life, but your kids, is moving.\n\nIf you went to your parents and started to shame them, or tried to stop them, then you would totally be TA.\n\nBut you have a right to be upset that this is happening. NTA", "You are entitled to your feelings, so NTA as long as you keep those feelings to yourself or convey them respectfully (and only once). I wonder if part of your anger is coming from the way that you were raised so strictly, and now that you're free to do as you like, they've decided that they aren't going to be so dogmatic.", "My family were nudists growing up, so I have some perspective here. It is for sure awkward for kids (you in this case) and any other family members who do want to participate in the clothes-free ethos. You are entitled to feel put out by that decision. That said, that choice is well within your parent's prerogative to make as a lifestyle choice for themselves. So, NAH, but you and your parents are both going to learn how to adapt, and find accommodations to continue to see each other. FWIW, the members of your family who would be most able to adapt to visits with your parents are small kids. They are adaptable and do not GAF. With tweens and teens it's a different story.", "your NTA for getting upset - a lot of people would be upset about a constant thing in their life suddenly leaving, however they have done their part in raising you and hosting the family and its their time to live how they want to", "NTA because just watch them complain that they never see you. \n\nSure they can live how they want. You know that. But to grow up under their oppressive rule only for them to choose this lifestyle? That\u2019s a tough, hypocritical pill to swallow", "YTA.   \n\nYour parents are their own people.   They raised 7 kids to adulthood and are able to live where and how they want.\n\nYou absolutely can bring your kids to see your grandparents.   Why would you intentionally made it awkward?    You can also invite your parents to your home.   You can also meet somewhere in the middle, plan a vacation together, spend time together at your siblings home.    Grow up.", "I guess YTA/NTA would really come down to how you discuss the situation with your parents. It's your parent's life, they're gonna live it how they want, and I doubt they would go nude around the kids (but who's to say about the rest of the community). Like I said, y'all just need to sit down and talk through everything like normal, reasonable adults.", "YTA. They're adults. Their kids are adults. As distinct adults, you have separate lives. Everybody's free to live theirs as they see fit. You being fussy about how your parents choose to live their life reflects pretty bad on you.", "Soft YTA. I feel like part of this is stemming from the fact they were so strict when you were younger. Now they've loosened up and all that pain and anger from being restricted unnecessarily is coming back up in a \"Oh so you could've just been chill this entire time?\" type of way?  Like you were bamboozled into following their rules but now they've thrown those rules out the windows over the years? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just saying the background information of them being strict doesn't feel relevant from an outsider's view, but to you it feels very relevant.", "NAH.\nI say this because I see where you are coming from. But also I completely understand your parents having an empty nest and the opportunity to live as they please now. You should look up more about nudist colony\u2019s. For one thing, people aren\u2019t always walking around stark naked and for another, I imagine your parents will be clothed when you visit. It certainly doesn\u2019t have to be awkward. There\u2019s actually a documentary on Netflix that kinda shows you the idea behind a nudist colony and how people live there. I don\u2019t know where you stand with such things, but it\u2019s a great opportunity to help your kids understand body positivity as well as boundaries. A nudist colony isn\u2019t a place where a bunch of creeps live, just people that love the opportunity to feel free.", "NTA for getting upset but if you lash out at them or try to shame them then yes you would be the AH. \nThey are adults who can make their own decisions. Just have them over to visit instead of going to their place.", "YTA\n\n\"I haven't told them all of how I feel about it, but it makes me upset that they would basically just leave all their kids and grandkids behind. Why couldn't they just visit the community regularly instead of moving there? Am I the asshole for getting upset about this?\"\n\nThey're grown ass, empty nesters.  They get to live their own lives. People move away all of the time.  It happens.  I have lived at least 6 hours away from my parents for over 2 decades.  Also, it's not your business if it's a nude place or not.  This is their decision to live where they would be comfortable.\n\n\"we often bring our kids to our parent's house to play. They all love our parents and have a great time over there.\"\n\nI get it.  It sucks.  But those days are now gone.  Keep your comments to yourself, unless asked.   When they complain that no one visits, feel free to open up with  \"Well, mom and daddio, we're all just uncomfortable visiting a nude community that you chose to move into.\"  No need to shame or blame, but make sure they understand that their decisions have consequences.", "YTA. Y'all are all grown. They can move wherever they want. Don't want to visit them at their nudist colony? Then invite them to your house. You're just being selfish.", "YTA if you haven't gone to the community and seen what it is like. Clothing optional communities have many different ways to accommodate children (or rather people's weirdness about nudity and children.)\n\nYou are reacting to your uneducated assumptions about clothing optional communities, not to the reality of what this one is like.", "Well, that's one way of getting out of family visits. Lol.\n\nI don't think you're wrong to be upset and disoriented by your parents essentially becoming completely different people from the ones you always knew. I'd feel very lied to and deceived.\n\n Or for feeling abandoned since they have made a life choice which excludes the majority of your family. People get mad enough at childfree weddings, and that's a single afternoon. This is a big fat \"don't want your kids around\" slap to the face and a declaration that you guys are no longer a priority. Which anyone can do, but there are consequences. Like fewer visits, hurt feelings, and being dropped in priority themselves.\n\nInsisting you visit them instead of acknowledging that they'll now need to be the ones traveling to others also feels icky, like they're trying to force this lifestyle on you. Like they're going to shove the lifestyle in your face until you accept it, and are holding their relationship with you and the grandkids hostage until you act 100% ok with it.\n\nAt the current moment, I would step back and observe. Switch to a nearby sibling's house as the main hub for visits and entertaining. Your kids can still visit their cousins and if your parents want to participate, they can pull their pants up and come to the house or a restaurant.\n\nSince all of you live near each other and they're moving far away, it's on them to visit. It will hurt when they decide not to. Prepare for that. I think they're also in for a rough adjustment when they go from weekly/ daily interaction to nothing, since none of you will want to stay with them in the nudist colony, drive 6 hours round trip with kids, or pay for an expensive hotel.\n\nI'm going NAH. You can get upset about whatever you like, and while I think your parents have handled this announcement and transition very poorly, they are be free to suffer whatever consequences they feel are worth their decisions.", "YTA. You don't own your parents and they don't owe you a house for your children to play in.", "Hmmm, i know it seems awkward at first, but wouldnt it just spark the conversation about how everybody looks different beneath the clothes, but its about how we act towards each other thats meaningful. Being undressed isnt inherently sexual or inappropriate, although it may be awkward at first.\n\nOh well, maybe im just rambling.", "YTA.\n\nYou can ask your parents to visit you, after all, instead of going to them.", "YTA.  It's not your business to tell your parents where/how to live.  It's their call to make, not yours.  They don't need your consent or your permission.", "YTA. Their life, their choice. Express your feelings about the grandkid situation and maybe they\u2019ll be willing to compromise and meet you all elsewhere, with clothes on. \n\nThey spent their whole adult lives residing you all and putting aside their dreams for your sake. It\u2019s their turn to live.", "YTA. You kids are grown and they can live out their lives the way they choose to.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Your parents are choosing to move away from where the rest of your family lives. They are choosing to put a space between you all. You can dislike that, and it might even be unkind of them, but it's their choice. You can set the parameter that they will now have to come to you to spend time with your kids. You will undoubtedly see them less often. But they get to make their own decisions.", "NAH as long as you don\u2019t push further.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be disappointed that your parents are moving three hours away because you enjoy visiting them.\n\nThey are allowed to move wherever they wish and live however they like. They aren\u2019t hurting anyone.\n\nObviously part of the issue is how extreme this is from how you were raised but I view that as a testament on how much people can grow and change. I think with time you all will adapt to the new normal. \n\nYou all still love each other - you\u2019ll figure things out.", "YTA. They soent years raising you and the helping with the grandkids. They have earned the retirement they want. \n\n\nThere is also the possibility they don't want you all dropping in with so many kids at their place so often and you are sore over it.", "YTA. It's their lives, not yours. Let them live it and get over yourself.", "OP isn\u2019t there a way to communicate to them before dropping your kids off?

They don\u2019t need to consult any of you when it comes to changing beliefs, religion, location or lifestyle. \n\nYou feel uncomfortable because this is new for you. Humans, apparently, do lot like change. The system you grew up in is gone, the house is gone, the security and routine of visiting is gone. \n\nBut, your parents haven\u2019t died.

Both because of your upbringing vs now and because they won\u2019t be in your lives nearly as often. There is nothing wrong with being upset. \n- They might\u2019ve been waiting/suppressing for decades to live this lifestyle. Remember, they were also oppressing themselves with that religious family life. It\u2019s a big deal that they finally have the chance to be themselves. \n- Some people have commented that the parents would never actually be nude around the family. Don\u2019t assume that. My father invited everyone in the family to come to the nudist resort and the expectation was anyone who came would be nude.  If you don\u2019t want to be around that, you shouldn\u2019t go.\n- They should absolutely not expect or pressure you to be comfortable with their nudity or to participate. \n- You should absolutely not expect or pressure them to shape their lives around your family. They have earned this. \n\nProvided the above, NAH. It won\u2019t be the same and you\u2019ll need to adjust, but that\u2019s what an empty nest means.

Growing into young adults they very likley never got to experience much more than the conservative life they were raised in then, bam they started popping out kids and had to become parents no time for experimenting.
