Most of us weren't even allowed to date until we were 18. Well my parents have slowly been getting more lenient over the years, especially with younger siblings that have fought back more against their rules. Today, they started a group chat with everyone in the family letting us know that they are moving to the clothing optional community, but we're all still welcome to come visit them.\n\nThe real problem comes in with the fact that all 7 of us are married and most have kids. There are around 12 grandkids total. All the family lives relatively close together (within 30 minutes) and we often bring our kids to our parent's house to play. They all love our parents and have a great time over there. \n\nNow, we can't bring the kids to see their grandparents, or if we did it would be extremely awkward. I have no problem with them living this life, but moving far away from the family to a place that nobody in the family is really comfortable going feels selfish to me. \n\nI haven't told them all of how I feel about it, but it makes me upset that they would basically just leave all their kids and grandkids behind. Why couldn't they just visit the community regularly instead of moving there? Am I the asshole for getting upset about this?\n\nETA - I just want to clarify it's not that they babysit for us. We don't drop the kids off with them, we go over there to spend time with my parents and the kids also like seeing them. My parents do not take care of our kids, we take care of everything they need while we're there. We don't bring them to babysit, we just go over once a week or so to visit them.

So, NAH, but you and your parents are both going to learn how to adapt, and find accommodations to continue to see each other.

Like you were bamboozled into following their rules but now they've thrown those rules out the windows over the years? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just saying the background information of them being strict doesn't feel relevant from an outsider's view, but to you it feels very relevant.", "NAH.\nI say this because I see where you are coming from.

For one thing, people aren\u2019t always walking around stark naked and for another, I imagine your parents will be clothed when you visit. It certainly doesn\u2019t have to be awkward. There\u2019s actually a documentary on Netflix that kinda shows you the idea behind a nudist colony and how people live there. I don\u2019t know where you stand with such things, but it\u2019s a great opportunity to help your kids understand body positivity as well as boundaries.

Lol.\n\nI don't think you're wrong to be upset and disoriented by your parents essentially becoming completely different people from the ones you always knew. I'd feel very lied to and deceived.\n\n Or for feeling abandoned since they have made a life choice which excludes the majority of your family. People get mad enough at childfree weddings, and that's a single afternoon. This is a big fat \"don't want your kids around\" slap to the face and a declaration that you guys are no longer a priority. Which anyone can do, but there are consequences. Like fewer visits, hurt feelings, and being dropped in priority themselves.\n\nInsisting you visit them instead of acknowledging that they'll now need to be the ones traveling to others also feels icky, like they're trying to force this lifestyle on you. Like they're going to shove the lifestyle in your face until you accept it, and are holding their relationship with you and the grandkids hostage until you act 100% ok with it.\n\nAt the current moment, I would step back and observe. Switch to a nearby sibling's house as the main hub for visits and entertaining. Your kids can still visit their cousins and if your parents want to participate, they can pull their pants up and come to the house or a restaurant.\n\nSince all of you live near each other and they're moving far away, it's on them to visit. It will hurt when they decide not to. Prepare for that. I think they're also in for a rough adjustment when they go from weekly/ daily interaction to nothing, since none of you will want to stay with them in the nudist colony, drive 6 hours round trip with kids, or pay for an expensive hotel.\n\nI'm going NAH.

Have your parents actually considered that they might not see much of the grandchildren, as a result of their newly chosen lifestyle and location?\n\nI can sort of understand people wanting to be nudists in their prime but when they're pushing 60, who wants to see that?", "NAH", "I think YTA for being mad, just as they would be if roles were reversed. Upset I could see, you\u2019re likely to see less of them and that\u2019s sad, but mad means that you think that you should have some say in their lives and seeing as how they\u2019re grown adults, that\u2019s not how it is.", "I think the OP should learn something about social nudism before getting so upset. It's actually very family friendly. Your kids aren't going to die if they see a nude person. Nude is not lewd, and being nude is not necessarily sexual. If you don't make a big deal out of it, then your kids won't, either.", "Op can't be NTA because the parents are allowed to live their life......\n\n\nOP isn't an a hole but neither are the parents.....\n\n\nIts a NAH situation!", "Agree with /u/Thinkcow83 that this is classic NAH instead of N T A as there are no assholes in this story.", "I agree. I also don't see a problem with visiting them, it's clothing optional. Not nudism mandatory. \nYou can just ask them to wear clothes when you visit. It's not that hard. And hopefully they will agree to that, because they do need to understand not everyone is comfortable with seeing family members or anyone really naked.\n\nLittle kids definitely don't give af. They're so easy in that regard.\n\nNAH. Talk about this with your parents. This isn't the end. There are many options. Don't let this break apart your family.", "Why are the parents the AH? Surely it's NAH?", "Surely it's NAH? Parents are allowed to live their lives..", "Being \"upset by\" something, means that you don't like the situation. Being \"mad at\" someone means that you think they are wrong. And judgin them for what they do. This is where OP goes in to the AH territory for me.", "Oh that sounds so interesting! May I ask what it's called?", "Why? Ppl change, change is part of life .", "This is wrong. Nudists != Swingers.", "You're absolutely right. I just changed my verdict. I'm at work dealing with a crisis and was going in between writing this and going back to work and put a vote towards only OP without thinking about the parents.", "Just have a hilarious image of op telling her kids to cover their eyes on the drive through, and making sure all windows are pulled shut.", "My youngest up until last year would have been upset to know their were places he didn't have to wear pants (leg prisons he called them) and we never told him. Little kids eeally don't give af.", "I'm sorry, you're correct. I'll edit.", "Living their lives isn't the same as never coming to visit family. They're essentially abandoning their grandkids for a life without clothing and seemingly no other reason. It's entirely selfish to say you won't come visit your family in a clothed community just because you don't like wearing clothes. I don't understand why no one seems to understand this. It's much easier and cost-effective for two people to travel than a large group of people, and the kids can cover the costs if the grandparents are short on funds.  \n\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "It\u2019s called \u201cWorn Stories\u201d it\u2019s a documentary series  about people and their connections with clothes or the lack there of. Episode 1 I believe is about the nudist colony. It is quite interesting, I love every person on it as well. They are just gentle free spirits.", "I hope you managed to sort the crisis out?\n\nI work in the NHS and sometimes a bit of \"Reddit Relief\" is needed to bring me back to reality! \ud83d\ude02", "I'm hoping that the first bit of your comment was a quote and not your opinion?", "So when do parents get to live their lives. They have and raise the kids. They don't have a say in having grandchildren because that's their kids' business but at the same time if their kids decide to they should put what they want to do on hold because of that decision? I would say NAH because you're allowed your feelings OP but they should also be allowed to live their lives too.", "Thank you, it's now on my watch list!", "Lol, I'm in finance, so it's not anything life threatening, but Jesus Christ some people just don't know what the hell they are talking about. They go around in circles for absolutely no reason other than to confuse the shit out of you.\n\nLike I don't have time for this, and also, I am pregnant, so I am running to the bathroom every 15 minutes, wrap this up! \n\nGreat first day back at the office... (hope your day is better!) :)", "Sweet! I hope you love it (:", "First day back? Huh? I've been in every day since the 30th! \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nThe NHS doesn't stop for a small thing like Christmas or New Year! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"]}
