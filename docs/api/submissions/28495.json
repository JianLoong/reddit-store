He expressed his opinion he would rather you not go but he didn\u2019t tell you not to.  You responded like a child saying basically \u201cI do what I want and you can\u2019t tell me shit\u201d.   You started a pissing match with him for no reason.", "YTA. \n\nYou escalated this really unnecessarily. Especially if what he is saying is true and he\u2019s never told you not to go somewhere. \n\nLike damn, when I choose not to pick up overtime my partner usually says \u201cgood, I didn\u2019t want you to go\u201d it isn\u2019t about trying to control if I work over time. It\u2019s because he enjoys my company and would rather that I be home instead of giving up my limited free time for more work. I say the same thing when his stuff gets cancelled.", "You argued with your husband about doing exactly what you wanted to. Why?\n\nYTA", "You sound exhausting.", "Your intention was to make him feel small and irrelevant, provoke him into a fight, then walk away when he wants to talk about it.\n\nEverything you did was 100% designed to cause emotional hurt to him. You succeeded, so what's the problem?\n\nYTA, btw", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even give him a chance to give a reason, you just jumped straight to that pretty petty response, no wonder he got upset. If he often acts controllingly then you would have good reason to respond like that, but going by the post he doesn\u2019t, and just expressed his opinion.", "Are you and your husband in middle school?", "YTA, you sound like a difficult person to talk to.", "YTA - Not wanting you to go is different from telling you not to go. This entire fight could have been avoided if you'd just kept your mouth shut. It could have been shut down when you agreed that he had never told you not to do anything. There was actually no conflict until you manufactured one.\n\nI'm pretty sure, that like most normal and well adjusted adults, you both go where you want without permission from the other. However, if that day ever comes where he tells you that you can't go somewhere, you deal with it then, taking circumstances into account at the time. \n\nWere you bored or something? Why are you, an adult, picking fights over things that haven't happened and likely won't?", "Why did you need to pick a fight just because he said he was glad you weren't going AFTER you made the decision.  You sound extremely unpleasant, and YTA.", "Did you consider that he was happy with your choice because YOU clearly didn\u2019t want to go if you were waffling that much about it? You should absolutely do what you want, but he wasn\u2019t forbidding you or anything. YTA.", "The fuck is wrong with you? YTA", "YTA\nYour husband made no attempt to influence your decision. After you announced your decision, he agreed with it from his point of view. You then created a conflict by taking offense at his choice of words in affirming your decision. I hope this is a singular instance and not part of a pattern where you critically analyze his way of talking rather than maintaining focus on the topic you're discussing.", "YTA. You have the right to make a choice and he has the right to express how he felt.

And your response is to punish him for it.", ">I answered, \"No. But it sounds like you didn't want me to go after all. \n\nThat's a weird thing to say when he told you outright that he didn't want you to go.\n\nAnd he told you *after* you made your decision so he wasn't trying to control you just expressing that he was happy with the decision.\n\nWhy would you reply with such a childish petty response about that not being the reason you are not going. He clearly already knew that.\n\nI can't even understand what about this interaction could possibly lead to you causing this argument.", "You started an argument for no reason.  You are the A hole.  \nHe basically just said that he wasn't going to tell you not to go, but deep down, he didn't want you to go, so he's glad YOU chose not to go.\n\nYou then throw it in his face?", "YTA\n\nIf his opinion didn't matter, why would you even involve him? You were clearly ITCHING for a fight.", "YTA. Very, very childish mentality you have. I can tell that you\u2019re often the victim in your stories.", "YTA by a mile. Grow up", "Yes.  YTA.  You are for the streets.", "If you do things and don\u2019t consult your spouse or seek their opinion then why are you married?", "YTA.  For sure.  He didn\u2019t tell you not to go.

You can't control other people's thoughts, and his actions did not affect you. If he didn't want you to go, maybe it's just because he likes spending time with you?\n\nEither way he wasn't stopping you, but you made it clear he isn't even allowed preferences. And it's a pretty inclusive statement that would make you entirely wrong in some circumstances. If you decide for instance after being cut up while driving that you want to go to the other drivers house for an argument, should he not be allowed an opinion on that? Or you want to go to a swingers club? Or dance in the road drunk?\n\nIt's needless confrontation and you successfully baited him into an argument before walking away when he defended his right to have an opinion, not to enforce it, but just to have it. \n\nThe dude doesn't have a partner; he has a contrarian.", "YTA. You literally picked a fight over a non issue. Congrats! Now it\u2019s a fight.\n\n\nETA: Regardless of your internal intent you still picked a fight over a non issue.

I can't imagine marrying someone so annoying.", "YTA", "YTA, do you always want to start fighting over nothing?", "YTA- he didn\u2019t tell you not to go anywhere, he\u2019s allowed to *prefer* you not go somewhere.

He didn\u2019t even express an opinion about your decision until after you had made a decision.", "Is there an option for everyone sounds like an asshole here?", "YTA.  Excellent ability at starting a fight about nothing with you husband though.  Great skill to develop to really grind him down.", "YTA. Are you 12??

Something it\u2019s better to leave well enough alone.", "YTA. You picked a fight.", "How old are you?", "YTA because you want to pick a fight and you\u2019re a 3 year old. \n\nCalm down grow up and get in real fights", "So he said after the fact he didn't want you to go but didn't tell you that he didn't want you to go prior to your choice or try to prevent you from going. You picked an unnecessary fight over his opinion. Unless I'm missing something here he wasn't controlling. YTA", "YTA, he never interferred while you were deciding.  \nBut now you pick a fight just because he was happy you didn't go?", "Truthfully sounds like you do not respect him.

Yta you picked a fight for no reason.", "YTA. Had he actually been ordering you not to go, your response would've been understandable but he wasn't, so you created a hostile situation. You got the fight you picked.", "YTA. Grow up", "In fairness, while you were considering going, he didn't tell you not to, even though he didn't want you to go.  So I think it's more that he got his back up by you seeming to suggest he is trying to control you, rather than him actually trying to control you in real life.", "YTA, he never said he would tell you that you aren't allowed to go somewhere he just said he was glad you weren't going because he would rather you didn't anyway.

To make sure you're both okay with it. There's obviously a reason why he doesn't want you to go.

I honestly don't see the issue here.\n\nHe didn't need to make any comments about not wanting you to go. His comment wasn't helpful at all and completely unnecessary. He could have just supported it as your choice. \n\nIf you came to Reddit and said you wanted to go but he was telling you not to go so many people here would be on your side.\n\nTo anyone stating he expressed his oPiNioN...

I knew this would be downvoted because people don\u2019t seem to understand that boundaries are not ever used to control another\u2019s actions. You cannot put a boundary in place that controls another\u2019s actions and it be healthy. Boundaries are about what you will allow personally to happen to you and what you will personally do if a boundary is broken ie remove yourself from the situation.
