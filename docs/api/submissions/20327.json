My nieces bio dad has never been present and my sister's ex husband wants nothing to do with her, despite raising her. Due to this, my sister is severely depressed and my niece has been acting out. My sister honestly can't handle it and it's made her spiral further. She sleeps a lot. Both my niece and her are now in therapy. \n\nMy nieces friend came over 3 nights ago and hasn't left yet. Since this girl arrived, both my daughter and my niece haven't been very nice to my son. Purposely making sure he isn't included, to a point of making comments to him for something simple (like him going in to the living room when they are watching a movie). They are taking \"girl time\" to the extreme and they have been spoken to several times about it and I thought it was getting better. \n\nWell, I got home from work today and my wife was noticeably pissed. She says \"choose what you want for dinner and go wake your sister the fuck up because I'm not feeding her kid or her kids fucking friend\". Apparently about 30 minutes prior the girls were being over the top mean to our son and it made my son rage out. I told my wife that I understood her frustration and I'm there to help her now. She said, through gritted teeth without looking at me and gripping the sink to a point of white knuckles \"Go wake up your sister because I'm not fucking feeding her kid and her kids fucking friend. I'm done.\" Sister hears and comes down and gets in to it with my wife about her lack of empathy (for denying kids food) and I agreed with my sister. I understand this is hard and that the girls are being asses but don't deny a child food. She told us all to get out (technically her house) and that I had better never darken her doorstep again. My sister and niece were very triggered by my wife and were both crying profusely.

I'm done.\"\n\nThis is a pretty vivid depiction of the situation. We don't get that often here with stories that are true...\n\nNo one is denying the kids food. The wife is just refusing to prepare it and by extension instructing YOU to inform the sister that she will have to provide the food.", "Your wife is not your sisters hand maiden, child care or therapist. I empathise with your sister but she is passing over her responsibilities to your wife and that\u2019s not on. She is grown and has children, checking out is not an option. It\u2019s a bit rich to accuse your wife of lacking empathy when your family has essentially handed all domestics tasks to her for what sounds to be an indefinite period. YTA and so is your sister", "So you come home from work, and your wife, in her own home, has been dealing with your depressed sister, your niece, and your niece's friend, and the latter two were mean to your son. Oh, yeah, there is also you 10 year old daughter present, being led on against your son by her cousin.\n\nAfter having to deal with ALL that, she reached her breaking point.\n\nShe **DIDN'T REFUSE** food to the kids. She said that your F... sister could make the food for her daugher and her friend who have been mean to your kid. The daughter your sister isn't parenting at the moment, and has apparently free game with her friend who is also staying at the house (why?).\n\nAnd the remark of not having empathy? You and your wife's household consist of the to of you + two kids. She put up with all these extra people **without any help** from your sister (nor you).\n\nAnd you side AGAINST your wife (and therefore AGAINST your kid)...\n\n**INFO**: Why has your niece's friend been staying for three days now? Especially with your sister doing nothing? Didn't your wife had enough to do already?\n\nYTA", "YTA. Depression is hard, yes. There is no reason for your niece to bully your son. Your wife should not be catering to your sister or niece. Your son comes first in his home - full stop. He should feel loved and welcome and if the niece can't handle that, they need to go. \n\nSupport your wife and children first. Sister and niece change or leave.", "YTA\n\nYou have let this situation get out of control and become a burden on your wife and son.\n\nFirst, if your sister is having such a severe mental health crisis that she can't even haul her butt out of bed and care for her own child, **then under no circumstances should niece's friend been invited for a sleepover.** Not even for one night. The friend needs to leave your house immediately. No friends may come over. Sorry. This is not a punishment. It is simply a reflection that sister and niece are too much of a burden on your wife as it is, you are doing nothing to help (that I'm seeing) and your sister is in such a bad mental health state that she is dumping the load of caring for her own child on your wife.\n\nSo of course your wife is pissed.\n\nThis arrangement needs an end date. You need to find housing for your sister and niece. You need to find some sort of employment your sister can handle. You need to get her on meds to handle her depression. If she is non-compliant, you need to kick her out of your house. It is not fair on your wife for her to be dealing with this mess from YOUR family while you are away from it at work.\n\nAnd no one DENIED her child food. There was plenty of food available. **Your sister is the child's mother. She is responsible for feeding her child. Not your wife.** Your wife is not her personal slave.", "Seriously... you really don't see how your sister and her kid and the freeloader they brought with them are the issue here?? \n\nFirst thing the freeloading friend should be sent back home. There is ZERO reason for her to be at your house anymore. \n\nSecondly your sister doesn't get to demand people show her sympathy, she has moved into your wife's home and brought other mouths to feed along with her. Your wife should NOT be expected to take care of 3 extra people what so ever. \n\nThen lastly there is the issue of your niece and her friend BULLYING your son to the point that he freaked out. Then your sister comes down playing the victim and you blame your wife for everything. \n\nYTA 100% your niece and sister are taking full advantage of the situation and your wife and son are the ones paying the price.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is a moocher and being entitled. Your sister is an adult and can go feed her own kid. Your niece doesn't get to be an AH to your son while they are a GUEST in your home.", "YTA  \n\n\nI completely empathize with your wife. She has to take care of additional children on top of your own, cook them food, and deal with them bullying her son. It's no wonder she was seeing red. The straw that broke her was her spouse not siding with her when she needed it", "YTA and so is your sister. This is a tough situation but these people are guests in your home and you are doing them a solid. In return, they have invited over a permanent guest (seriously why haven't you sent the niece's friend home? It's your house and your son they're bullying) and are bullying your son. Your wife is clearly at her wits end. No one was being denied food. She just wasn't going to be the one to make it. Who can blame her? Your sister's family have trodded all over her hospitality and kindness.\n\nFirst thing I'd suggest is not allow the sister's friend over any more. Then talk to your wife, apologize and come up with a plan for you to take over some of the things she's been carrying. Then talk to your sister about house rules.", "YTA - your sister, even if she's going through a lot and depressed, needs to parent her kid and be respectful of your home. \n  \nYour wife isn't a doormat, and her concerns need to be respected.", "YTA. Your sister can do her own chores and make food for herself, her daughter, and, in this case, her daughter's friend. Your niece doesn't get to use her situation to verbally abuse your son. You need some rules and boundaries, OP.", "YTA. I get that your sister is depressed but she still needs to take care of her daughter. Your wife should not have to make her daughters meals when your sister is choosing to sleep. Also why is her friend at your house for days on end? You need to support your wife and kids. Your son should not have to deal with being mistreated in his own home. Support your wife and kids. Set boundaries for your sister and send the friend home.", "YTA \n\nIt sounds like your sister and niece have overstayed their welcome and so has the random 3 day guest.\n\nThat you\u2019d allow them to bully your own kid and dismiss it as them having a hard time at the moment is ludicrous to me.", "YTA- she was not denying them food, she was forcing the adult guardian to manage her own charges. Clearly you let them take advantage of your wife and son until she was beside herself and then you show up and accuse her of cruelty?  what's wrong with you?", "Yta. Your wife is obviously feeling like her kindness is being taken advantage of and it appears like this is not the first time she has expressed this to you. Your sister and her daughter are not your wife\u2019s responsibility yet somehow she is being tasked not only with them but the added burden of their friends?  How is that fair to your wife?", "YTA.  Your wife did not refuse a child food, she merely refused to be the one to cook it. By the way, it is not your wife's responsibility to cook their food at all, ever, any day of the week.  Did your sister loose her ability to cook when she got divorced?  Did you lose yours?\n\nYou completely went TA when you accused your wife of \"triggering\" your sister and niece.  Your wife rightfully called out your sister and niece for the horrific way they were treating her son, and yours.  It should not have been your wife who had to take the matter into her own hands.  WTH is wrong with you?  Why is that other girl in your house for 3 days tormenting your son?", "YTA. You have a nuclear family: You, your wife, your daughter, your son. These people come before extended family. Oh, I missed that this is \"technically\" (factually) her house.", "INFO: is there a certain amount of time that your sister is staying, or is it indefinite?", "YTA. By allowing her to come into your home you were supposed to lay down the ground rules. Not have her come over so she could sleep all day, have your wife wait on everyone and then allow them to bring a guest on top of everything else. Bad move. It\u2019s no wonder she threw everyone out. You never allow your home to become someone else\u2019s motel;especially when it\u2019s not even yours to begin with.", "YTA\n\nYour wife didn't deny a kid food.  She said she wasn't going to feed someone else's child.  That's fine, because that child's parents should be the ones feeding them, and it's not your wife's duty to feed other people's kids.\n\nIt's rich as heck for your sister, the person who is responsible for feeding her own kid, to get into it with your wife over this.  Your sister can't be bothered to feed her own kid, but she's more than willing to criticize your wife, a woman who is feeding her own kids, because your wife won't act like a short order cook for everyone under 18 who walks through her front door.  Your sister may be depressed, but depression does not excuse blatant hypocrisy.  Your sister needs to start feeding her own kid and her kids' friends when they're over before she makes any comments about kids your wife is responsible for feeding.  \n\nBoth you and your sister are the AH for dumping everything on your wife and then having the audacity to act like your wife was the problem when she reasonably pushed back.", "Absolutely TA. Irrevocably TA.  The moment your niece and her friend said something to your son, that should have been the end of it. You don't cater to people because \"they're going through things.\"  You're not your niece's father, you're your son's father.  He trumps your niece and her bitchy little friend.  Your sister needs to woman up and deal with her daughter and start to put her life together, the end. You're not her husband or a crutch. You put everything on your wife and by siding with your sister, and even LETTING  your sister 'get into it with your wife?' TA.", "She wasn't denying kids food,  she was telling the other two adults in the house to feed them.

You or your sister could have made dinner and let your wife go have a break.", "YTA for not supporting your wife. No one is \"denying\" any children food. \n\nWhy is your sister letting her daughter's friend stay over for three nights on top of all of this?\n\nYour wife is right and she doesn't have to keep doing everything for everyone plus hangers-on. \n\nI hope you made dinner for everyone and got all the kids to help clean up.", "YTA. She didn't deny the kids food, that's a lie. She expected your SIL to feed the kids she was responsible for.\n\nLike do you think your wife is your sister's slave? WTF is going on in your head here...", "YTA.  Your wife owns the house.  She allowed you to move your sister and your niece into her house, for four (4) months.  Then, you took no steps to prevent your sister from bringing another person into your wife's house.  A person who, with your niece and your daughter, then began being horrible to your son.  You permitted this conduct by your family, by your guest, and by your daughter.  You've apparently been leaving the cooking of dinner for this lot to your wife.  When your wife declines to cook for this lot and your sister goes off, you side with - wait for it- not your wife.  You were not even accurate in what your wife said when you sided against her.  So you've been ejected from your wife's house.  Good for her.  Enjoy live with your sister, niece and niece's friend.", "I can't believe you are actively choosing your sister/niece in this situation over your own wife/kids.

She was saying that YOUR SISTER needs to cook for HER kid and her kid's guest.\n\nThey are bullying your son, so 1. The friend needs to go 2. Your sister needs to address her bullying your son 3.

Wtf it's called if it's that bad she needs in care help.\n\nYour niece is given free reign in the house, allowed to be a bully, and invite people over for days. Act like a brat and able to get away with bring spoiled because she isn't handling the fact that her step dad is a dick. Her mom is a dick for putting herself before her kid. \n\nYou, as actual family, have done nothing to put a stop to the bullying.

You go off on her that she is denying them food. \n\nThen, to top it off, you are allowing your son to be bullied and abused in his own home. His safe spot where it should never happen. Teaching him, he means Jack shit to you. That his needs and feelings mean nothing, and he is expected to put up with it. \n\nYour wife done with everything puts her foot down, trying to give you benefit of the doubt, and you disrespect her for saying no more.\n\nGood job. I'm glad she kicked you out. Hopefully, she divorces you and takes you for all she can. Cause your kids will remember this. Will remember dad putting a spoiled brat and a mom refusing to care for her child before his family. \n\nAnd yet to all here which shows you think you are in the right.

Your wife is not denying anyone food she has said she is not feeding them so step up. ITS YOUR AND YOUR SISTER'S JOB TO MAKE THE FOOD AND BUY THE FOOD for everybody.

My nieces bio dad has never been present and my sister's ex husband wants nothing to do with her, despite raising her. Due to this, my sister is severely depressed and my niece has been acting out. My sister honestly can't handle it and it's made her spiral further. She sleeps a lot. Both my niece and her are now in therapy. \n\nMy nieces friend came over 3 nights ago and hasn't left yet. Since this girl arrived, both my daughter and my niece haven't been very nice to my son. Purposely making sure he isn't included, to a point of making comments to him for something simple (like him going in to the living room when they are watching a movie). They are taking \"girl time\" to the extreme and they have been spoken to several times about it and I thought it was getting better. \n\nWell, I got home from work today and my wife was noticeably pissed. She says \"choose what you want for dinner and go wake your sister the fuck up because I'm not feeding her kid or her kids fucking friend\". Apparently about 30 minutes prior the girls were being over the top mean to our son and it made my son rage out. I told my wife that I understood her frustration and I'm there to help her now. She said, through gritted teeth without looking at me and gripping the sink to a point of white knuckles \"Go wake up your sister because I'm not fucking feeding her kid and her kids fucking friend. I'm done.\" Sister hears and comes down and gets in to it with my wife about her lack of empathy (for denying kids food) and I agreed with my sister. I understand this is hard and that the girls are being asses but don't deny a child food. She told us all to get out (technically her house) and that I had better never darken her doorstep again.

Then you get yourself together and continue.", "Yes, of course, but that's not the point I made.", "Let me guess. You are often told you misread the room and are not sure why.", "No but he should have. I don't think he did everything ideally, I just didn't think he intended to have his wife and son suck it up and deal. \n\nAs I said in another comment, when the friends presence was causing turmoil he should have sent her home. He and the sister should make a clear cut plan of steps that she will take to heal and regain her independance, everyone should participate in meal prep instead of leaving it all to his wife, when he noticed his son wasn't included he should have taken him out for a 1-1 activity, etc.", "I agree with that. The sister should be taking care of her kid. There are many things OP could have done to de-escalate this before it went down like send the friend home, take the son out for 1-1 time with dad so that he gets to do some activities and gets space from the girls, participate in meal prep, make a plan with the sister with steps she will take to improve her situation and re-gain independance, etc.", "OPs sister absolutely WAS choosing to own the raising of her child off on OP and wife. What\u2019s she going to do note that get also have no where to live?", "that's all fine and good.  You sound like a nice person who gives folks the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, I tend to be more evidence based. I see no evidence that he has done anything or even suggested or offered anything helpful. Like nothing. What he did show was dismissiveness (after vividly describing her white knuckled frustration) about the circumstances that led to the issue and the fact that his wife is past her breaking point. Where is his concern for her?  Where is his concern for his son?  Like... any evidence of it at all.  I see zero.  He's all in on his sister and niece, tho.", "And THIS!! I see it the same way he just jumps straight onto the sisters side when the wife said she wasn't cooking she didn't deny food she refused to cook and yes why is the friend there for 3 days .....where are her parents? It shouldn't fall on the wife to take care of them and op should care about how his son is being treated he's the AH all the way!", "I agree with your perspective, and due to it have changed my own. Originally I felt that OP was trying his best to support everyone involved and was struggling to maintain it all. I now see that the facts point to him not interviening until it all came to ahead. If he's going to step up for sister and niece in their time of need, he needs to ensure he is supporting the rest of his family aswell. Allowing his wife and son to be pushed to their breaking point without interviening then dismissing them when the snap is whack."]}
