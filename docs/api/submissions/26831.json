However, that\u2019s only of little concern to me right now.\n\nShe and her husband (34M) have been trying to have a child for a few years and have trouble doing so. I\u2019ve been empathetic of this very huge concern and I get it: it is hard. She\u2019s also done IVF and some other treatments but they\u2019ve not worked out for them so far. So, to bypass that, they asked me to donate my egg to them - which I very readily agreed to do. However, it came with a caveat. They wanted me to come \u2018in a day\u2019. I live in a different city, I\u2019d have to fly down and back (6+ hours) and miss days of work. I told them I\u2019m anyway coming to their city on 7 October for a couple of weeks (for a family meet) and I can do it then. It\u2019ll also save me a bunch of money on airfare.\n\nThey refused and said I should come within a couple of days to make it happen. While I understand they are in a rush, but why am I being expected to 1. travel on my own and 2. Do it as per their convenience.\n\nMy mother also pitched in here: she said I should be more understanding as they\u2019ve been trying for years and must be in a lot of stress. I told my mother I understand and I\u2019ve not really said no to it; I\u2019m happy to do this. But they should either pay for my airfare or let me come when it is convenient for me. But now, things have turned into a whole thing and the entire family is calling me and AH for not going to their city to help them. So, am I an AH for not going?\n\nEdit 1: thanks so much for your perspective, everyone. I really appreciate it. It has really made me dig more about how the procedure is done because I honestly had very little clue about all the things I\u2019ll be put through. I don\u2019t have any children of my own and don\u2019t plan to have one any time soon. So I thought there would be no harm in doing so. \nAs for the part about me going there without any prior preparation, they really just needed me to come so I can meet the doctor with them to see if it is viable.", "created_utc": 1694676589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ibtqy/aita_for_not_travelling_to_a_different_city_to/", "score": 868, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don\u2019t live near them, it seems like it would make more sense for you to find a Dr near you to do the steps up until egg retrieval.", "NTA\n\nDo you realise there are serious risks to you?  In order for the biggest chance of success with egg retrieval, they want to get as many as possible so they try and get as many as they can with you injecting hormones for a few days at the right time of your cycle.  You then risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (which can make you incredibly sick and hospitalise you).  You also have to be at the right stage in your cycle for them to get the eggs and that might not be in the time that you are meant to be going over.  It's not about your convenience and there's much more to it.\n\nYour sister isn't very nice to you and she acting very entitled with no thought of the risk to you.\n\nAlso remember that if they are successful in carrying a baby.. that technically you are the child's biological mother, even though your sister will be the birth mother.  It's a lot to get round and most reputable IVF companies will require counselling so that both parties know what they are getting into.  There are legal ramifications here depending on what country you are in.", "NTA\n\nThey forget you are doing them a favor, not the other way around. At this point I would tell them you decide not to donate an egg, did you research how they retrieve the egg and what side effects it can have for you.\n\nDid they even offer to cover airfare and lost income?\n\nBe careful, they sound entitled", "NTA remind them they want something from you and you are subjecting yourself to a medical procedure for them, so it will be on your terms and your terms only or not at all", "While what you're proposing to do is very kind Op, they're literally allowing you for your DNA. Their asking you to give them a baby.  \n\nNot only do they need to pay for EVERYTHING  (flights, rental car, hotels, medical,  procedures etc) you need to MAKE SURE you have a CLEAR CONTRACT so they can't either sue you for child support (it's YOUR DNA)and can't drop the kid off on your doorstep later cause \"it's your egg, it's your kid\". And on top of that, lost wages. You WILL be taking time off work, 3 days to a week or more, if there are complications. That also needs to be included. \n\n\nOp think very, very, very carefully on this.  It's a huge deal, does a massive number on your body despite the short term, and can have huge consequences. \n\n\nYou need a contract with them that outlines EVERYTHING they are on the hook for, and CLARIFIES that is only egg donation - you're not to become their surrogate of its found your sister cannot carry.\n\nThat's a whole other can of worms (that they would still need to pay for everything for and still have a contract outlining what you are/ are not willing to do)  \n\nYta if you don't protect yourself and demand compensation. There is a reason nearly all egg donation is anonymous (like sperm donors).", "NTA..... that's not how IVF and egg donation works. Like at all. How can your sister have NO idea of how it actually works if this is what they want to do. They should really educate themselves first.", "OP don't do this. You're NTA but you would be to yourself if you went through with this. Egg retrieval is a huge, expensive and very risky process, that will require you to take a series of hormone drugs that dramatically increase your risk for certain cancers, to say nothing of the side effects of the actual retrieval.\n\nYou don't have a good relationship with your sister to begin with, they're already balking at paying for your airfare or doing things on your timeline, they're not going to cover anything else so you're going to be out of pocket for an expensive procedure, out of pocket for anything that goes wrong and if the first retrieval doesn't work you better believe they'd be demanding you do the whole thing again for them", "Wow. NTA.\n\nWoman who went through fertility struggles here. They are being beyond pushy and illogical.\n\n1. Now maybe they have a doctor appointment set up on a certain day - then THEY pay for you to travel or they see if they can  reschedule to when you plan to be in the area.\n2. They need to not wait 'to figure things out' and waste your time with a trip that may be premature. They need to go to the trouble to fully understand the process (including timelines and when/whether you really have to be in their city for any of it). Although it is their responsibility, I personally recommend you do some research of your own. I don't like the idea of relying on them for info when they are already  showing poor thinking skills.\n3. You may be able to do most or all of the process in your town. If there are expenses, they should foot the bill, not you (unless you offer).\n4. As for the rest of the family, don't know if they just share in your sister's sense of desperation or if they tend to support her over you in general. But they are not the ones actually doing anything. Tell them all, if it's so damn important, then they can cover all the costs; otherwise, they need to shut up about something they are not actually sacrificing any of their time or money for.\n5. Last thought, you accepted pretty readily. It might be wise for you to give yourself a  chance to get fully informed about the process and take some time to consider the impact on you. You may still be ready, but you may decide it's not for you. That is OK.

Your sister sounds unstable enough, right now, that it may not be safe for you to be around her and her husband.  Stay away.

You\u2019re doing them an ENORMOUS favour and they should be treating you like the goddess you, quite frankly, are. It\u2019s a whole procedure that could be medically difficult for you, and you\u2019re doing it out of the goodness of your heart. \n\nI sympathise with your sister\u2019s plight - I\u2019m her age and would dearly love a child too - but I would never expect anybody I might ask to help out to have to pay for anything.", "News flash... donating eggs is a 2-3 months procedure... And is painful, and you are in pain after... I have had 13 IVFs and transfers, so trust me I know what I am talking about. The one time I had mine done in Canada, they didn't provide anesthetic...Anesthetist is expensive...It was literally hell... Another, it would be your child and your relationship with your sister isn't decent... She literally thinks that donating eggs is like donating blood... To say she is entitled is understatement. Don't do it... with your sister... you will regret it... She isn't a person you want to see your kid to grow up... you would have to watch them grow an your sister would be acting the same. Change your mind until it is not too late. I have used mine and donated eggs and the it is an ordeal... In US egg donation is expensive and your sister needs to pay for it to understand what an amazing gift you \"were\" offering. Don't let your family bully you into it.

However, that\u2019s only of little concern to me right now.\n\nThis should be a huge concern to you actually. She has always looked down on you, expects you to be available whenever she asks, doesn't realise that this is actually HUGE favor YOU are doing FOR HER. After reading a few of the comments above and what risks you might have (regarding your health) , as well as possible legal ramifications (them asking for stuff because it's your dna) I, personally, would absolutely refuse to do this for her. They are not showing you basic respect and gratitude, they feel entitled to your eggs. If you end up in the hospital for some reason because of this, do you think she will be there for you and pay for what is needed? Do you think she will agree to signing a contract regarding future legal implications? I honestly believe you would be on your own and still looked down on because \"poor health\", \"bad eggs\" or whatever poopy spaghetty reason she might find. Deffinitely NTA. But you might be the A for yourself of you go along with this. If it is approval you seek or hope for a better relationship with her, I am almost 100% sure it won't happen, based on what you wrote.

It's an invasive process and it takes a while and is not comfortable. Are you sure your sister is intending on egg retrieval and not surrogacy, as in have sex with her husband??\n\nNTA. And if you're going to do this massive favour to them they should be paying for your airfares and accommodation etc for the cycle where you hang around in the city of their ivf clinic and grow your eggs and donate them.", "NTA The fact that they're pressuring you into this with only a couple of days notice, when you won't have the support system of your family around like you would in October is sending some huge red flags.

Understand that your relationship with your sister may likely get worse. She will be raising your biological child/children depending on how many eggs take. What if she's a crappy parent?

Ideally, you\u2019d do everything by you, they\u2019d come for the retrieval day to take you and make sure you\u2019re comfortable after at home (during the actual retrieval process, your sister\u2019s partner would go provide his boys at the appropriate office). Then when, ideally, embryos are frozen, they can be delivered to their location. Embryos get transported all the time. It\u2019s way easier logistically for the retrievals to be done in your neck of the woods since there\u2019s so many appointments over the process (a few leading up to things, then every other day for like 7-12 days) and then the retrieval itself. I\u2019ve had 4 egg retrievals. The healing process isn\u2019t bad\u20141-2 days of consistent cramping and a few days after of random pains when jostled (driving sucked).

You are all adults - this is between you, if she runs off to her mummy then you get ganged up on then again you wont agree to it.\n\nIts a huge thing to do - you have to also mentally come to terms with it being your bio child and will see them grow up. If you are fine that's great - but  have you discussed what they will tell the child - will they ever be told?  Will the child want more from when they are older?\n\nHave they discussed what will happen if she dies before the child is 18 - say she and her husband both die in a car crash - who will raise the child? Does she have the ok from someone to be raise the child if they die? Will your mother raise the child - or will everyone turn to you the bio mother and guilt you? Will they then keep turning to you for money - the child needs a college fund - the child needs a car- will they say we spent so much money on IVF we have no savings and you are child free so you have to pitch in.\n\nAs for the appointment - tell them you want to do the first appointment via video with the doctor. Most doctors in private practice post covid will allow for a teams or zoom meeting.  You want information about how long, what drugs you will need to take, how many visits you will need to make. Then you need to do it to your own timeline so it doesnt impact your work - so it will be done to your schedule. Maybe the doctor says the egg retrieval can be done near you.

Possibly through coercion/without consent, acting immediately before the couple changes their minds about whether it would be considered cheating in terms of their relationship, the moral/ethical nature of such conception, the desperation for the ends justifying the at best questionable means, and with no real paper trail as evidence if this plays out (a benefit of not paying for travel or going through the proper channels, as there is no way they don't know how egg donation works after struggling with infertility for so long).\n\nBe careful, OP.

It is caused by the ovary producing too many eggs in response to the drug stimulation. The condition results in abdominal distension and discomfort. We specifically monitor the egg donors for signs of these and, if they indicate, we may stop the programme. When ovarian hyperstimulation occurs it reverses completely over a period of 1-2 weeks.\n\nIt may become a more serious problem in 1% of women undergoing egg donation and very rarely it can be life threatening. Deaths have been reported as a result of OHSS but you are 10 times more likely to die following natural childbirth than from donating eggs.", "Plus lost work time.", "All of this, plus the cherry on the sundae- let's bypass all the difficulty and expense they want op to subject themselves to, let's pretend op does it, it's successful first time, and a healthy child is born. Op would still have to watch her bio-kid being raised by her horrible sister. How could you subject a child to all that? Get while the gettin's good, I say...", "eggs donors are treated differently that surrogates. But, nevertheless, donating eggs being childless is a worst decision ever.", "Yes, I have seen it happen, and even in the family, the relatives pay tens of thousands to the sister as a compensation...The op sister is living in a different galaxy", "Especially with the possibility this could be the only kid OP ever has since the procedure has the potential to cause future infertility", "Indeed it is not fast either, not sure if it would take longer than the 9 months tbh... I just mentioned the fast as in faster than trying another 2-3-4 times with anything else.\n\nI also didn't really thought about the therapy part, but i fully agree!\n\nCos \"losing\" or rather (in this case) not even being able to bear a child must be traumatizing.", "It takes a few months to even get in at most fertility centers. (If not more!) And then the cycle at soonest can happen in about 4-6 weeks depending on OP\u2019s cycle and the clinics regimen. IVF is a waiting game for sure.", "OP's sister is 34 and is feeling the biological clock ticking. That doesn't mean OP should abandon their responsibilities and pay airfares to fly back and forth whenever summoned, it's just why the sister is likely in such a hurry.", "Totally agree, and from OPs post she is gonna be there in less than a month.", "It\u2019s less than a month! She\u2019s going to see them Oct 7. It\u2019s Sept 14. She\u2019ll be there in three weeks!", "That's horrifying. I hope OP reads this. Also, with how awful and toxic her sister and family are, she should back out on that principle alone. Then add this to that. They clearly care nothing for OP already, she'd be treated just as poorly.", "Thanks for sharing this. It really makes me want just say no without even going to the doctor. This is just horrific.", "That was horrifying to read", "I didn\u2019t have anywhere as extreme as needing a stay in the ICU, but I also am a super responder to the IVF hormones. Thankfully I knew it was going to happen the second time so I was given preventative medication, which has existed for years, to keep me from having free fluid. I\u2019m sad that she obviously wasn\u2019t cared for properly.", "Holy crap, I'm an active part of that sub and I had never seen that post before. Wow. I absolutely had no idea there was so much risk associated with the process, nor did I realize that there would be recklessness associated with it (well, any more recklessness than usual in medicine).  I assumed there was a whole process and rules and regulations for this.\n\nSilly me, this is America, why would there be rules and regulations for anyone other than people making money?", "Wow. I had no idea.", "I doubt that OP would have to give that many eggs. Since it's specifically for her sister and she's not doing it for money. But I really don't know a ton about IVF and egg donation. I do know that having to take the hormones over a period of time leading up to donation can be hard on a woman.", "Yeah, the sister claiming she's done IVF seems sketch because she should know you can't just walk into a hospital and demand they remove eggs on a whim.\n\nI'm kind of wondering if the sister was doing something weird like buying sperm off the internet or something. Weird things go on like this all the time.", "This is what I was thinking,  which puts some sus on this being real situation", "Wait until they find out how expensive IVF is!", "Remind them that they want something from you and that you are subject to a medical procedure for them, so it will be on your terms or not at all.", "And they have to pay for everything. Flights, medical, hotels, everything.", "Do you realise there are serious risks to you? In order for the biggest chance of success with egg retrieval, they want to get as many as possible so they try and get as many as they can with you injecting hormones for a few days at the right time of your cycle. You then risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (which can make you incredibly sick and hospitalise you). You also have to be at the right stage in your cycle for them to get the eggs and that might not be in the time that you are meant to be going over. It's not about your convenience and there's much more to it.", "They use birth control to control your cycle for a month + before you start the growing eggs hormones. Apparently I get ovarian cysts on birth control, so eventually we had to go with a natural cycle. All that took 6 months. When you do get to the egg growing stage, buy stool softeners (not laxatives). I didn't poop for like 3 days around the time of the retrieval.  It was pretty miserable and bloaty.", "My husband used to be on a pharmacy customer service team that handled coverage for fertility drugs. He said those used to be the most stressful calls he's ever had because the timing for getting and using those drugs had the hopeful mothers on edge.", "OP is spare parts to them.", "When you see the infertility specialist, tell them you are not comfortable donating. Most will say the process won\u2019t be successful for you. I say \u201cmost\u201d because some fertility clinics are a bit predatory, so do be careful.", "Your BODY your CHOICE.  If it doesn't  feel right in your GUT don't do it.", "You can say no! It's hugely risky and invasive and you do not owe the contents of you body to anyone!!!", "Could it be that they want you as a surrogate?\n\nFrom \"only one egg\" to \"it's the same, when you can birth, too\".\n\nAnd making you a scapegoat for nothing, even though you have valid reasons....some people shouldn't recreate......", "I was a donor as well (six times total) and my experience was nothing like the one in this post. I apparently have an extremely high follicle count and respond really well to the drugs, but the fertility center I went through must have monitored the situation better because aside from some general cramping (nothing worse than my normal Menstrual cycle) I was always fine after a day or two. I donated at least 30 eggs each time as well, sometimes more, so the reaction can also depend on the person. It\u2019s really unfortunate that the agency this person went through didn\u2019t treat her well.", "My niece did it to have her own child...her third round of IVF was successful with one of three implantations successfully coming to term. \n\nShe got uterine cancer when her baby was 14 months old. She has been told it is due to the hormones and she has had a complete hysterectomy.", "They take however many eggs are developed for harvest via the medications (typically 10-20, sometimes fewer).  Then, the ones normal enough for fertilization get fertilized.  Then those have to make it 5 days growing to be viable for transfer.  When I did IVF, they harvested around 15 eggs and I ended up with 4 embryos in good enough condition to transfer.  Of those, 1 miscarried, 1 didn\u2019t implant after transfer, 1 is my almost 3 year old daughter, and I\u2019m pregnant with the last one.  I had better implantation odds than normal, so many eggs are often needed for success.  All that said, the egg retrieval process was the WORST part of IVF and I would not have done a second round if it had been needed to get pregnant.", "My friend did it and even though it was partly covered by the government, it was still a lot of money.", "I was an egg donor and the entire process took about three months. On top of that, I had to go in to an office at least once a week, and later in every other day and then the last week every day to have my blood drawn and follicles measured so that they would know when it was time to schedule retrieval. There\u2019s no way OP can just pop into an office and have them retrieve an egg that day.", "Congrats on the kids. Glad it turned out so well for you. My cousin, who I grew up closely with and who is like a sister, was having trouble. She miscarried around 3 times. I am her closest living female relative and I volunteered eggs if she wanted to go that route. She is the only person in the world I would ever make that offer to. Thankfully her next pregnancy was good, he's now a junior in college."]}
