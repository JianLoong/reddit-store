However, that\u2019s only of little concern to me right now.\n\nShe and her husband (34M) have been trying to have a child for a few years and have trouble doing so. I\u2019ve been empathetic of this very huge concern and I get it: it is hard. She\u2019s also done IVF and some other treatments but they\u2019ve not worked out for them so far. So, to bypass that, they asked me to donate my egg to them - which I very readily agreed to do. However, it came with a caveat. They wanted me to come \u2018in a day\u2019. I live in a different city, I\u2019d have to fly down and back (6+ hours) and miss days of work. I told them I\u2019m anyway coming to their city on 7 October for a couple of weeks (for a family meet) and I can do it then. It\u2019ll also save me a bunch of money on airfare.\n\nThey refused and said I should come within a couple of days to make it happen. While I understand they are in a rush, but why am I being expected to 1. travel on my own and 2. Do it as per their convenience.\n\nMy mother also pitched in here: she said I should be more understanding as they\u2019ve been trying for years and must be in a lot of stress. I told my mother I understand and I\u2019ve not really said no to it; I\u2019m happy to do this. But they should either pay for my airfare or let me come when it is convenient for me. But now, things have turned into a whole thing and the entire family is calling me and AH for not going to their city to help them. So, am I an AH for not going?\n\nEdit 1: thanks so much for your perspective, everyone. I really appreciate it. It has really made me dig more about how the procedure is done because I honestly had very little clue about all the things I\u2019ll be put through. I don\u2019t have any children of my own and don\u2019t plan to have one any time soon. So I thought there would be no harm in doing so. \nAs for the part about me going there without any prior preparation, they really just needed me to come so I can meet the doctor with them to see if it is viable.", "created_utc": 1694676589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ibtqy/aita_for_not_travelling_to_a_different_city_to/", "score": 3230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don\u2019t live near them, it seems like it would make more sense for you to find a Dr near you to do the steps up until egg retrieval.", "NTA\n\nDo you realise there are serious risks to you?  In order for the biggest chance of success with egg retrieval, they want to get as many as possible so they try and get as many as they can with you injecting hormones for a few days at the right time of your cycle.  You then risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (which can make you incredibly sick and hospitalise you).  You also have to be at the right stage in your cycle for them to get the eggs and that might not be in the time that you are meant to be going over.  It's not about your convenience and there's much more to it.\n\nYour sister isn't very nice to you and she acting very entitled with no thought of the risk to you.\n\nAlso remember that if they are successful in carrying a baby.. that technically you are the child's biological mother, even though your sister will be the birth mother.  It's a lot to get round and most reputable IVF companies will require counselling so that both parties know what they are getting into.  There are legal ramifications here depending on what country you are in.", "NTA\n\nThey forget you are doing them a favor, not the other way around. At this point I would tell them you decide not to donate an egg, did you research how they retrieve the egg and what side effects it can have for you.\n\nDid they even offer to cover airfare and lost income?\n\nBe careful, they sound entitled", "NTA remind them they want something from you and you are subjecting yourself to a medical procedure for them, so it will be on your terms and your terms only or not at all", "While what you're proposing to do is very kind Op, they're literally allowing you for your DNA. Their asking you to give them a baby.  \n\nNot only do they need to pay for EVERYTHING  (flights, rental car, hotels, medical,  procedures etc) you need to MAKE SURE you have a CLEAR CONTRACT so they can't either sue you for child support (it's YOUR DNA)and can't drop the kid off on your doorstep later cause \"it's your egg, it's your kid\". And on top of that, lost wages. You WILL be taking time off work, 3 days to a week or more, if there are complications. That also needs to be included. \n\n\nOp think very, very, very carefully on this.  It's a huge deal, does a massive number on your body despite the short term, and can have huge consequences. \n\n\nYou need a contract with them that outlines EVERYTHING they are on the hook for, and CLARIFIES that is only egg donation - you're not to become their surrogate of its found your sister cannot carry.\n\nThat's a whole other can of worms (that they would still need to pay for everything for and still have a contract outlining what you are/ are not willing to do)  \n\nYta if you don't protect yourself and demand compensation. There is a reason nearly all egg donation is anonymous (like sperm donors).", "NTA..... that's not how IVF and egg donation works. Like at all. How can your sister have NO idea of how it actually works if this is what they want to do. They should really educate themselves first.", "OP don't do this. You're NTA but you would be to yourself if you went through with this. Egg retrieval is a huge, expensive and very risky process, that will require you to take a series of hormone drugs that dramatically increase your risk for certain cancers, to say nothing of the side effects of the actual retrieval.\n\nYou don't have a good relationship with your sister to begin with, they're already balking at paying for your airfare or doing things on your timeline, they're not going to cover anything else so you're going to be out of pocket for an expensive procedure, out of pocket for anything that goes wrong and if the first retrieval doesn't work you better believe they'd be demanding you do the whole thing again for them", "Wow. NTA.\n\nWoman who went through fertility struggles here. They are being beyond pushy and illogical.\n\n1. Now maybe they have a doctor appointment set up on a certain day - then THEY pay for you to travel or they see if they can  reschedule to when you plan to be in the area.\n2. They need to not wait 'to figure things out' and waste your time with a trip that may be premature. They need to go to the trouble to fully understand the process (including timelines and when/whether you really have to be in their city for any of it). Although it is their responsibility, I personally recommend you do some research of your own. I don't like the idea of relying on them for info when they are already  showing poor thinking skills.\n3. You may be able to do most or all of the process in your town. If there are expenses, they should foot the bill, not you (unless you offer).\n4. As for the rest of the family, don't know if they just share in your sister's sense of desperation or if they tend to support her over you in general. But they are not the ones actually doing anything. Tell them all, if it's so damn important, then they can cover all the costs; otherwise, they need to shut up about something they are not actually sacrificing any of their time or money for.\n5. Last thought, you accepted pretty readily. It might be wise for you to give yourself a  chance to get fully informed about the process and take some time to consider the impact on you. You may still be ready, but you may decide it's not for you. That is OK.

Your sister sounds unstable enough, right now, that it may not be safe for you to be around her and her husband.  Stay away.  And don't be her egg donor.", "NTA did they even offer to pay for the trip and your missed work days?", "They\u2019ve been waiting for years, they can wait another month.", "NTA you're doing THEM a favor, they can either respect your time or do without and keep trying on their own.

You\u2019re doing them an ENORMOUS favour and they should be treating you like the goddess you, quite frankly, are. It\u2019s a whole procedure that could be medically difficult for you, and you\u2019re doing it out of the goodness of your heart. \n\nI sympathise with your sister\u2019s plight - I\u2019m her age and would dearly love a child too - but I would never expect anybody I might ask to help out to have to pay for anything.", "News flash... donating eggs is a 2-3 months procedure... And is painful, and you are in pain after... I have had 13 IVFs and transfers, so trust me I know what I am talking about. The one time I had mine done in Canada, they didn't provide anesthetic...Anesthetist is expensive...It was literally hell... Another, it would be your child and your relationship with your sister isn't decent... She literally thinks that donating eggs is like donating blood... To say she is entitled is understatement. Don't do it... with your sister... you will regret it... She isn't a person you want to see your kid to grow up... you would have to watch them grow an your sister would be acting the same. Change your mind until it is not too late. I have used mine and donated eggs and the it is an ordeal... In US egg donation is expensive and your sister needs to pay for it to understand what an amazing gift you \"were\" offering. Don't let your family bully you into it.

However, that\u2019s only of little concern to me right now.\n\nThis should be a huge concern to you actually. She has always looked down on you, expects you to be available whenever she asks, doesn't realise that this is actually HUGE favor YOU are doing FOR HER. After reading a few of the comments above and what risks you might have (regarding your health) , as well as possible legal ramifications (them asking for stuff because it's your dna) I, personally, would absolutely refuse to do this for her. They are not showing you basic respect and gratitude, they feel entitled to your eggs. If you end up in the hospital for some reason because of this, do you think she will be there for you and pay for what is needed? Do you think she will agree to signing a contract regarding future legal implications? I honestly believe you would be on your own and still looked down on because \"poor health\", \"bad eggs\" or whatever poopy spaghetty reason she might find. Deffinitely NTA. But you might be the A for yourself of you go along with this. If it is approval you seek or hope for a better relationship with her, I am almost 100% sure it won't happen, based on what you wrote.

It's an invasive process and it takes a while and is not comfortable. Are you sure your sister is intending on egg retrieval and not surrogacy, as in have sex with her husband??\n\nNTA. And if you're going to do this massive favour to them they should be paying for your airfares and accommodation etc for the cycle where you hang around in the city of their ivf clinic and grow your eggs and donate them.", "NTA The fact that they're pressuring you into this with only a couple of days notice, when you won't have the support system of your family around like you would in October is sending some huge red flags.

Please don't go through with any of this and keep your distance.", "Please look into this deeply! Read the above articles. Do more research. Understand that your relationship with your sister may likely get worse. She will be raising your biological child/children depending on how many eggs take. What if she's a crappy parent?

Ideally, you\u2019d do everything by you, they\u2019d come for the retrieval day to take you and make sure you\u2019re comfortable after at home (during the actual retrieval process, your sister\u2019s partner would go provide his boys at the appropriate office). Then when, ideally, embryos are frozen, they can be delivered to their location. Embryos get transported all the time. It\u2019s way easier logistically for the retrievals to be done in your neck of the woods since there\u2019s so many appointments over the process (a few leading up to things, then every other day for like 7-12 days) and then the retrieval itself. I\u2019ve had 4 egg retrievals. The healing process isn\u2019t bad\u20141-2 days of consistent cramping and a few days after of random pains when jostled (driving sucked).

You are all adults - this is between you, if she runs off to her mummy then you get ganged up on then again you wont agree to it.\n\nIts a huge thing to do - you have to also mentally come to terms with it being your bio child and will see them grow up. If you are fine that's great - but  have you discussed what they will tell the child - will they ever be told?  Will the child want more from when they are older?\n\nHave they discussed what will happen if she dies before the child is 18 - say she and her husband both die in a car crash - who will raise the child? Does she have the ok from someone to be raise the child if they die? Will your mother raise the child - or will everyone turn to you the bio mother and guilt you? Will they then keep turning to you for money - the child needs a college fund - the child needs a car- will they say we spent so much money on IVF we have no savings and you are child free so you have to pitch in.\n\nAs for the appointment - tell them you want to do the first appointment via video with the doctor. Most doctors in private practice post covid will allow for a teams or zoom meeting.  You want information about how long, what drugs you will need to take, how many visits you will need to make. Then you need to do it to your own timeline so it doesnt impact your work - so it will be done to your schedule. Maybe the doctor says the egg retrieval can be done near you.

Possibly through coercion/without consent, acting immediately before the couple changes their minds about whether it would be considered cheating in terms of their relationship, the moral/ethical nature of such conception, the desperation for the ends justifying the at best questionable means, and with no real paper trail as evidence if this plays out (a benefit of not paying for travel or going through the proper channels, as there is no way they don't know how egg donation works after struggling with infertility for so long).\n\nBe careful, OP.

Thankfully her next pregnancy was good, he's now a junior in college.", "NTA. Haven\u2019t gone thru IVF but I did freeze my eggs. Egg retrieval is the same for IVF or egg freezing. Some thoughts:\n\n1. If they want you to meet with the doctor to see if you\u2019re a good candidate, you can meet with the doctor online. They will ask you to do a series of blood work to check your AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) levels. The AMH is an indicator for your egg reserve (higher level = more eggs in your ovarian reserve). No point in having an in person meeting when you can meet online and have bloodwork sent from the lab to clinic.\n\n2. If you are still willing and can do it, they need to pay for your airfare and all associated costs (bloodwork, drugs, hotel, vitamins, income from missing work). You can prime your body at home (a month of birth control to level out the hormones), but as soon as you start the procedure, you need to be close to the clinic because you get an ultrasound every couple days to measure egg growth. It\u2019s a 10-14 day procedure from first injection to egg retrieval, depending on how you respond to drugs. \n\n3. Keep some of the eggs for yourself. You\u2019re young. You\u2019ll most likely respond well to drugs and your eggs are at their prime (meaning fewer eggs will have chromosomal abnormalities). If you get 24 eggs, for example, they can create embryos from the first half and freeze the second half. If there aren\u2019t enough embryos created from the first half of the eggs, then they\u2019d have to use the second half. If they don\u2019t end up using the second half, keep them for yourself to use later on. If you have fertility issues in your mid-30s or later, you\u2019ll have these eggs. Whenever you do use these eggs, they will be at the health of the age your froze them. There is an annual cost associated with frozen egg storage. Check out this egg calculator and probability of live births: https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3937/bwh-egg-freezing-counseling-tool-efct \n\n4. Get all of this in a contract. \n\nGood luck.

Giving your eggs is not a one day thing from start to finish it takes months of prep, meetings, paperwork etc.", "NTA as a donor conceived child with more than 21 siblings myself and another unknown number... please don't support this practice. It's also real risky for a woman. It's an unethical thing and while slightly better if it is known and not huge sibling numbers.. it sucks not being your parents bio kid, being lied to, not being recognised by your bioparent or having a social parent treat you differently... and sooooo many parents weaponise it in a divorce or in anger against their kids.

Clinics usually care more about the customer (parents) than the source (you). It\u2019s still a for profit industry, and without donors they lose their business.

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll just give an excuse for why it won\u2019t work with you", "NTA. What you\u2019re offering is a big deal and is stressful to the donor in several ways. It should be done on YOUR schedule (within a few weeks), not theirs.", "Have donated eggs, I do not recommend it. Messed up my hormones and mental health for a few years.", "NTA The second sentence is all we need to know, honestly. Don't sacrifice anything for her. She doesn't care about you.", "They want you to donate an egg or two but you should foot the bill to get there? Really? Who's paying for the procedure to harvest your eggs? Or do you have to help them pay for that too? It should be at your convenience but they're adamant it be at theirs? Hmmm, is your mother going to pay for tickets to get there and back? While I agree they maybe stressed they're behaving like you owe them this, when you don't. They should be grateful you said yes and be flexible as to how and when you'd get to them for it. Did they tell you they may have to harvest more than one egg? Bet they didn't. NTA, if they can't wait or at least buy the tickets for you to there, they can look for another donor", "NTA that is your sister, her spouse, and your mom for not understanding what is truly involved in egg donor retrieval from the hormone shots that you have to take.  Why do you have to fly to them let alone take time off from work?  All of this will impact your life for days if not months depending on if the doctors get enough eggs after you get hormone shots.  Who is going to pay for your lodging and the procedures?\n\nSo your sister, your mom, and her spouse need to stop harassing you about this and should ask if you would do it.  If they are going to pay for it or are you?  Is this what you want to do or is it being forced on you?", "I would seriously reconsider", "OP you're much better than me. I would've backed out of pettiness after being treated like this", "NTA - your sister and your family are asking for too much.", "NTA. Sounds like if you went your wouldn\u2019t be \u2018allowed\u2019 to go back home.", "You're fine. If they really want you to donate, they need to pay for all expenses. That includes travel, car rental, lodging and food. It should also include health expenses you may incur resulting from the donation. You shouldn't have to foot the bill for any of that.\n\nIf they balk at this, it's evidently not as important as they are making it seem. They may be upset about it but that just speaks to them being pretty entitled.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's sad that your sister feels it's okay to both belittle you and then demand you be that generous. There's health risks involved for you as well as serious expenses. Your mom seems to be way too willing to see their side rather than yours too.", "NTA if they've been trying for years a couple weeks isn't going to matter.  It's insane they're being pushy about this when you've volunteered to undergo invasive medical procedures for their benefit. How much more selfish could two people be?", "NTA", "NTA but you may want to do more research about IVF and donation. I've done IVF and you usually will do meds to help grow follicles so the clinic can retrieve as many eggs as possible and that's monitored closely with medications, scans and blood tests so it really isn't based on when you want to do it based on your body and how you respond.  You may have to dedicate 2 months Minimum for this process which also includes Anesthesia and recovery after egg retrieval. It's awesome what you are doing but I think your sister and you need to be on same page", "NTA\n\nIf they are asking you to go through an invasive medical procedure for them, they should make it convenient for YOU.", "NTA I could barely walk from the swelling of the hormones during egg retrieval cycle. I was so swollen literally none of my pants fit. I had to buy new pants. Literally cannot fathom flying in that condition. Find an Ivf place near you. Then they can ship your eggs.", "OP - if you decide you do not want to donate and for some reason you don't want to tell your sister to her face, find a time when you are alone with the doctor, or alone with the nurse, or call ahead, etc and just tell them that you do not want donate and being forced to. They will tell your sister you are not a candidate and go through other options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Make them coke to your city. Or pay your way.

This is the least they can do.", " NTA but DO YOUR RESEARCH make sure u know what ur signing up for before u make up ur mind it isn\u2019t as simple as u go in they take eggs and u walk away there r a BUNCH of dr visits hormones medication genetic testing this isn\u2019t something u can just \u201ccome the next day\u201d for there is a whole process if ur going through a SAFE accredited facility it makes more sense for u to see a dr in ur area and for THEM to coke to u as u will be the one going back and forth to the apts maybe have it set up so u also have a dr there that way if u really want to the transfer can be done there but this isn\u2019t something that happens over night I was a egg dinar for my sister and ugh what a nightmare! I donated my eggs in 2013 which even back then was a lengthy process and when my husband and I wanted to have kids we actually really struggled all the hormones and stuff I was on for the egg donation somehow messed up my \u201cnatural levels\u201d we\u2019ve been trying since 2016 to get pregnant I JUST finally got pregnant I\u2019m about 11 weeks but it was a struggle so do ur research and ask a lot  of questions", "Why wouldn't you just do IVF in the city you're in and your BIL can come give his specimen and your sister can come for the transfer? \n\nAlso, btw, but remember you're agreeing to help to (seeming AHs) bring an innocent child in this world. Will they be good parents and kind to the person who will be your genetic child and your new or nephew? I'd think twice if I was you.", "NTA. But your family is a boatload of them! This should not be done with guilt trips.", "Ugh that\u2019s not how egg donation works. You\u2019ll need to go through the whole egg retrieval process which will require several almost daily visits to the clinic for about 2 weeks.", "NTA \nInfo: why can't they adopt?", "Don\u2019t do it, OP! NTA", "There are too many red flags here, I wouldn\u2019t agree to this.", "Their desire to rush the process is a huge red flag. OP, you need informed consent.  These people do not sound like they have your best interests in mind at all!", "Also, this is a medically and surgically invasive procedure.\n\nYou should probably start by setting up an appointment with your own doctor or OB/GYN.  Find out what is involved.  Find out if this is something that is appropriate for your particular medical situation.\n\nAnd find out from a doctor who is only caring for you, not one getting paid to help with your sister's fertility issues, which gives them a conflict of interest.  \n\nYou need to consider this in regards to your entire medical situation, not just your sister's need.  There may be very important reasons, for your safety, why you should not do this.\n\nAnd do not let them rush you into anything.  You might also want to have a lawyer, one familiar with family law, look over any legal forms they want you to sign, and explain to you exactly what is going on.  You don't want to inadvertently agree to anything or commit to anything, thinking you're just signing a \"routine form.\"  \n\nKeep your eyes open, and remember that no one else in your family, besides you, is going to be looking out for ***your*** best interests, rather than just thinking about the hoped-for child.", "Don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t attend this initial meeting virtually! And 100% they should cover flight costs and host you for any extra travel needed associated with the retrieval!! NTA", "Are we sure they're not gonna just strap you down and harvest you for eggs because that's a weird insistence", "Maybe she wants you to do it the old fashioned way", "You can speak on the phone or Zoom. There's no reason to treat this as an emergency. \n\nI would tell them that, if they keep pressuring you, you won't do it. I'd be afraid they'd blame me or my egg or it doesn't work. They sound almost frantic, which is not a good way to go about starting this process. It sounds like they will hound you day and night until they have your egg. \n\nThink about the implications of your sister having what is essentially your child. How will this play out given their state of mind? It needs more thorough thought and time. NTA", "Right?! OP should not have to pay anything at all!", "My sister just got their adoption confirmed (baby not born yet) after 3.5 years on a waiting list. Definitely not fast.", "I wonder if they had an appointment scheduled the next day, and that's why they wanted her there?  But, OP is NTA.  Donating an egg is no easy feat.", "This might be why they are trying to rush you. They want to force a commitment from you before you do research. Which is not right of them if it is the case.", "You\u2019re allowed to walk in and say you\u2019re not comfortable and you\u2019d like to keep that confidential. They will find a reason for incompatibility.\n\nIt\u2019s not a nice procedure and you deserve time to do research before being pressured into signing things.", "Yeah, donating eggs is a big deal.  You say you and your sister have a difficult relationship, so I can't figure out why you're even considering it.  If I were in your shoes, it would be a hard no.", "Damn hope she\u2019s recovered now\u2026didn\u2019t know it had such an impact on a woman\u2019s body :(\n\nAdding that to the list of things that need to be mentioned in sex Ed but arent", "Not everyone.

However, that\u2019s only of little concern to me right now.***\n\nThe above should VERY much be at the forefront of your decision to NOT do this for your sister, OP.\n\n1:  If the pregnancy doesn't go to term, you will get the blame.  Even if it does go to term and something is 'wrong' with the child, you will get the blame.\n\n2:  Any future with your 'nibling' will be watched closely.  And that's provided you get to even have a relationship with said little being.\n\n3:  If said child fails/or doesn't meet sister's expectations, you may well find yourself suddenly taking care of said child.\n\n4:  (And this is the important one)  Does your sister just want your help or is it an EXPECTATION that you should just do what you're told because she thinks so little of you?\n\nNTA for the title.  But OP please consider your future and all the ramifications to it even if you do this on your own terms.", "What pricks", "**This isn't how donating eggs works.** YTA for lieing.\n\nMy old roommate did this. To donate eggs you need to sync your cycle with the recipients. Then you have to take fertility shots for a month before they take out your eggs. \n\nYou also have a shit ton of paperwork to fill out with the facility doing the procedure.", "NTA, why do they act this way when you\u2019re doing them such a big favor. Really think if you would be okay with your sister raising you bio child.", "Not to be weird but - are you absolutely positive they don\u2019t expect you to carry the baby as well? Because if so, that would explain why they think it can be done in a day.", "NTA\u2026sounds like mean older sister didn\u2019t even have the time table of this process. Mom is siding with big sis because she wants to be a grandma. No one is thinking about OP. It\u2019s too bad OP agreed to to this. As badly as she was treated by her sister, I\u2019d be concerned about a baby that came from OP\u2019s egg retrieval.", "You don't seem to grasp the impact of this in your body. You'll get heavily hormoned (and look at all the health risks like OHSS). You'll have to endure painful surgery to retrieve the eggs.

People who need your help and yet have no qualms to inconvenience you and then call you an a\\*?  Maybe you need to think about this.", "NTA, your sister and her husband could have offered to pay for airfare if they insisted you be down there right that day", "Be careful ! I have heard of sisters wanting egg donation then finding out the expenses and trying to guilt you into being a surrogate, having sex with husband and giving her the baby .", "With this level of preparation i would retract the proposal. If they don't want to grasp what kind of trajectory they want to get into and still expect you to bend over backwards, the whole thing will be a tremendously grating experience for you. That combined with the entitled attitude and no regards towards your needs... I'd let that relationship strain a bit more i were you. They should be gratefull you will even consider undergoing an invasive procedure for their sake.", "They should pay for your travel", "This is why video calls are a thing???\n\nCan't they ask. Or do they want you to get an exam? Then your doctor could give you an exam.", "I definitely don\u2019t think this is real. It OP\u2019s sister has already tried IVF herself she knows OP can\u2019t just fly to them on a whim and deposit a bunch of eggs. She knows the retrieval process.", "With the rapid pace and seeming lack of understanding about the egg donation process, I\u2019m wondering if BIL and Sis either truly have no clue how this works or if they are holding back some info. \n\nSis would have been checked for egg viability prior to IVF. Since IVF and \u201cother procedures\u201d didn\u2019t work, why do they think using a donated egg will? Is the issue the eggs or is the issue, as Monica said on Friends, an \u201cinhospitable environment\u201d?", "Also what will happen when the kid finds out, and they will find out. What does OP do then? What will they family do then?", "Yeah I 100% think this is fake but\u2026that\u2019s the case for I think most AITA posts. Hell I\u2019m guilty of it.
