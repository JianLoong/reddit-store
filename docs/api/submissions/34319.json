I am going to call my sister Anna. Anna got cancer when she was 15 and was able to beat it. Ever since she has been having growths and anytime one appears we are worried about the cancer coming back. \n\nMy issue is that she always makes these announcements that she needs to go to the doctors again at the worst times. At the beginning I thought it was just bad timing but it has happened so many time when I hit a milestone. My graduations, my birthdays, my engagement party. Anytime she makes an announcement she needs to go back to the hospital my whole family with flock to her.\n\nI have had my birthday dinner turn into my relatives flocking to her for the whole night.\n\nI had a dinner party to announce my wedding  date for my relatives. It was going so great and it was a fun time until Anna told mom she needs to go back to the hospital. Soon everyone forgot about the reason for the dinner party and it was quiet. My aunt even stepped in to do a pray for Anna. Another event was taken over. I went low contact with her after that.\n\nShe was invited to the wedding and it is in two weeks. I learned today she is in a on and off in a wheelchair from my mom/Anna. She will need to take it just in case for the wedding. I asked if the rest of the family was informed and she told me no. I told both of them they need to inform them. They told me they don\u2019t want to worry them and won\u2019t do that.\n\nI had enough and told them you need to tell before my wedding. Again a no. I then informed them Anna is not invited. \n\nThis started a huge argument about how I\u2019m a dick and my point is that I am sick of her stealing the spotlight. That what will happen if she rolls in with a wheelchair.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to do a mass blast to all my relatives, saying she is in a wheelchair and unsure if she will be able to make it to my wedding, keep my sister in their thoughts and prayers.\n\nI\u2019m gettin ahead of this.", "created_utc": 1704391733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yjla9/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_at_my_wedding/", "score": 8284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A little strange that she always makes that kind of announcement in that situation, anyway praying for her,You'll probably regret it if she doesn't attend anyway", "I would have a conversation with sister and say I feel that every time I have a special event, you choose that time to share with family and friends your medical issues. I feel this is something you share outside of these events. I feel that when the celebration should be about my milestone events it becomes focused on you instead. \nMaybe say to her due to the event venue at my wedding I feel it necessary to let our family members know that you may or may not require more patience as you use things like ramps, elevators etc with your wheelchair. \nSomething like there will be guests who may require the use of ramps and elevators. The wedding venue has asked guests to have patience and to inform them of the number of guests who require accessibility services as some of these things require a specific key.  If you send out a general note of the venue has accessibility features and that there will be guests in attendance who may have need of them, maybe it will take some of the need of the sister to have the spot light on her\n\nI guess it depends on if OP wants to keep the relationship close with sibling or not.  \nUltimately the OP gets to decide on the guest list. \nIt's tricky to navigate and weddings can bring out the worst in people.", "YTA\n\nEver consider, I don't know, talking to your sister before just kicking her out of your wedding?  Maybe saying to her 'listen, you're my sister and I love you but I've noticed XYZ...this day is really important to me so can we talk about anything that you want to talk about, say, the night before?'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr hey, be a grownup and tell your guests yourself.\n\nBut no, you jump right to the nuclear solution.  Easier to just trash your family relationships than have a conversation.  Good job.", "Maybe if you pray real hard you will get cancer and be wheelchair bound on your wedding day and then you can have the whole spotlight.  /s\n\nYTA", "Yes. Weddings are stupid affairs and cancer is a life or death affair. Your discomfort means nothing next to hers.", "NTA.\n\nIf you do decide to let her come, put a comms out to the other guests, saying that your sister will likely need to use a wheelchair for some or all of the day, and that she's a bit sensitive about it so please can people avoid commenting on it or talking about it. That'll puncture her balloon!", "YTA.  But own that shit.  Send out a mass blast to the whole wedding list that your sister isn't doing well again, that you're concerned she might not be able to make the wedding, and even if she can she'll likely be in a wheel chair.  But you know she loves you and she wouldn't want her illness to disrupt your special day.\n\nAnd for bonus points, hold a moment of silent prayer for her health during youe reception speeches. Lean into that shit.", "NTA given that the problem actually the attention-grabbing behavior.  However, there's no good way to avoid it by uninviting her because it sounds like your family will either bring her anyway and dare you to kick her out or spend the whole time bitching about it.  I like the suggestion of another poster that you contact the other guests for \"accommodation\" purposes and deal with the apparent blowback from your family with that.  \n\nHowever in the future, it's best just not to invite people who have demonstrated that they will try to grab the spotlight any way they can.  Interrupting your major events half the time to announce some new issue is deliberate.", "Your sister announces everything medically related to everyone all the time, why being suddenly quiet about it right now? Probably to annouce something bad to everyone in the middle of the reception maybe? Something doesn't feel right indeed !\n\nNTA", "Nta\nBut consider even her non presence will draw attention as many will want to know why she isn't there. And if she is \"ok health wise\". So, will your mom get the bulk of the questions and attention since it sounds like she is in the \"know\"? Just a thought.", "NTA I saw your edit. Do that. I am sorry that your sister is sick but it is not fair that the lives of all family members are her personal show.", "NTA\n\nShe knows what she's doing. \n\nYou can be confident she has a special announcement planned for the wedding. \n\nWould have been better to not invite her at all, but this is still a wise move.", "NTA. I feel so bad for you. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to show up and surprise everyone with the wheelchair.", "Disinviting her will make the wedding about her as well. \n\nIt certainly sounds like she dislikes the spotlight being on you. A lot of it might be resentment from you not having the real medical issues that she has had. She probably needs therapy. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I would tell your parents that if she hijacks the wedding as you suspect she will, you\u2019re going to go zero contact with her and she won\u2019t be welcome at any future events or milestones. Let them know what you think is going to happen. If you\u2019re wrong, then you get the wedding day you want. If you\u2019re right, then you won\u2019t have to deal with it any more. \n\nEither way I hope you post an update.", "How sad that you think she will take up all of the spotlight.  You are having a marriage.  Not a wedding.  There is no need to have all the attention.  In the era of social media everyone craves attention and the spotlight.  What about craving kindness, grace, maturity?   What does attention even give you? It\u2019s momentary.  Marriage is the real goal.  And it should be about kindness, grace, understanding.", "ESH- you are for not wanting her there because she might be in a wheelchair. Her, because some of these things are a little too much of a coincidence to be occurring every time you have a milestone. My guess is she's depressed and sad that she's not also reaching similar milestones. (I'm assuming.) But also, as a chronic illness patient- some of this really is just a coincidence. We can't control when our bodies fall apart or flair up.", "Nta , sounds like she specifically correlates her \u201cneed \u201c to let people know she\u2019s sick with every opportunity you have for get-together or party.", "This has to be fake", "INFO: Is there any reason you can't inform your wedding guests yourself?Just a text saying \"Just a heads up!

You might be want to have a discussion with just him about it, like have a surprise lunch with him and explain you fears and frustrations. A grandparent would be good too, basically anyone who can talk to Anna and/or your mom on your behalf and make sure things go smoothly.

I have two siblings and both are like this. One has a genetic disorder and the second has a host of mental disorders that they are working their way through. Both like to be the center of attention and both use whatever trick they have up their sleeve. I am the oldest and have mostly gotten used to having birthday dinners where my sibling wanted because they cried at my choice or given long winded speeches about themselves at my graduation party, etc. I\u2019m very, very low contact (practically no contact) with the second one and somewhat low contact with the first. \n\nShoot, one of them totally screwed me over on my first marathon a year ago. My mother went to cheer me on and had my car keys and wallet while I ran. My phone died at mile 25, so I had nothing (I texted my mother right before it died, so she knew). Around mile 10, my sibling called my mother crying that his stomach hurt and he needs to go back to the hospital he NEEDS to be picked up (she didn\u2019t tell me because she knew I\u2019d tell her he\u2019s faking). So she left to pick him up. Turns out he was just bored sitting at home and didn\u2019t actually need anything. She took him to a local theme park and drove back to my race. By then, I was sitting on the pavement with no information, no way to get anywhere, no way to get food (I just ran 26.2 miles. The banana they gave me was not enough). Sat there for over an hour with no idea what was happening and no way to contact anyone. (My mother was genuinely worried for his health and equally angry when she realized his true plan.

She has been deteriorating (as is common with the DM1) and suffering for about 2 decades (we are older than you)).  At times, she has used a wheelchair and now MUST use one.   She cannot control when she is in and out of the hospital for dialysis, possible amputations, heart problems, etc.   We may lose her any day.  She has a terrible life.  She was hospitalized and unable to attend her daughter's wedding two weeks ago.  So, we all went to the hospital  and took pictures of her in her wheelchair.   \n\nNow, here's the rub.  When we were kids, she was a terrible sibling.  My sisters and I were treated poorly by her.  Mean as a snake.  Manipulative.  Rude.   Mostly I couldn't stand her.  So, I have empathy for your position and  I'm sorry you feel left behind with the attention issues.\n\n   But consider how much better your life has been, with or without these \"thunder stealing days\".  You are getting married.  You will live to go on and have kids (if you want to) and follow your dreams.  She will spend many days alone, with an IV and Auntie's prayers, eating shitty hospital food with overworked staff who put her last at every turn.  I hope you can find some empathy.  We eventually did  b/c when we really looked at what was going on, we had to evolve.    This is just my experience.  Honestly, can  you try to  find the strength to just be grateful you are a healthy person who has found love.  Some people will NEVER have what you have.  Is the attention that important to you?    I have had many terrible incidents with my sister - - but I still have empathy.  B/C I would not trade places with her for ANYTHING!!!   Would you??  \n\n I liked the idea of a pre-emptive email alerting people to the situation.  Best wishes to you.  I hope I have not been too harsh.  I just know that when push came to shove, you may feel differently if your sister passes early.  If she is in a wheelchair at your wedding, so what?   In my case, my sister is about to die.

It was pretty bad.   I was just sort of at home, no special treatment or toys, about the same time my cousin got a really bad burn on his leg and needed a skin graft.  The whole family went nuts bringing him toys, my mom spent more time with him in the hospital than with me at home.  Sometimes your family is so awful they find a way to make you the glass child even when you ARE the sick child.", "My friend, a twin, had her spine broken at birth. She worked hard, was very independent, owned her own car, and supported her self. Her sister became an alcoholic and once said, \u201cDaddy always carried you.\u201d Like it was so awful. SHE COULD NOT WALK!  That twin was nuts.", "That\u2019s not a glass child it\u2019s a scapegoat.", "Hard same. My mother often lamented that she was stuck with someone as sickly as I am, but because my little brother was a chubby, healthy baby, he got anything he wanted. She wouldn\u2019t get me a bike because she was sure I\u2019d just suddenly die while riding one and then it\u2019d be a waste of money. I initially wasn\u2019t allowed even birthday cakes, because at age 8 I was supposed to have outgrown that, but when she realized we could use that day to get my *brother* a cake, I was finally allowed a birthday cake, as long as it was a flavor he wanted. To this day I refuse to touch pistachio ice cream, because all of my birthday cakes had to be pistachio ice cream cakes, and even though it looks delicious, I\u2019m avoiding it on principle lol.", "I was ALSO the disabled one and the glass one! My sister was SUCH a troublemaker as a \u201cresponse\u201d to my illness, and I would just take care of all my own needs, be the family therapist (and with my mom it was even often enough about MY OWN ILLNESS that she was \u201cconfiding\u201d in me about), and try to be invisible otherwise. \n\nAs adults she claims she was a glass child (which is how I even learned about it!) and I can see how she acted out as a *result* of me being sick, but it\u2019s confusing reading about it and being like \u201cbut\u2026.thats me? You were always making sure everyone was looking at you????\u201d", "wow hi we're twins! I'm the disabled child, I almost died and was sick my whole childhood, yet I was also a straight A student who took care of the other siblings, and caught flack for everybody else's bullshit. \"Glass child\" assumes a family is remotely functional and anyone is getting attention. whereas I routinely came out of the hospital shitting water and disappeared into the night \u2014 as a *middle schooler* \u2014 and no one looked for me cuz nobody gave a fuck", "So the reason the term glass child came to be was solely due to it being the non disabled or ill child. In technicality you wouldn't be the glass child if you're the disabled sibling.", "I was the oldest of 3, a brother and a sister is the youngest. I was often left to fend for myself and look after them. I\u2019m really screwed up because of it. And my family doesn\u2019t understand at all. My grandma is sick and dying soon from lung cancer. The other day I finally admitted to her that I am getting help for my mental health. Her response was, \u201cWhat the hell do you need a psychiatrist and medication for!?\u201d It\u2019s like I have ptsd from the military. I have all kinds for issues from replacement parent syndrome as I like to call it since I pretty much replaced my parents at their role for a good 5 or 6 years every day after school for 6-8 hours a night. I\u2019m deeply depressed. I have crippling anxiety from being bullied my entire childhood which I never spoke to my family about because they all would have over reacted. I was abused by my mom and my grandma agrees my mom was a hateful nasty woman. When my mom died a few months ago I was able to breathe the most refreshing breath of my life. It\u2019s like gran I love you, but please see the reality of what\u2019s going on with me. I don\u2019t use drugs anymore, but you know I was addicted to drugs. Hell you are part of what got me started on that path you bought me drinks at the bar when I was 10.", "You are handing this with pettiness and grace and I appreciate this so hard.\n\nPlease update us so we know how it all goes down.\n\nWe are rooting for you", "Please update us with how it plays out. Strong NTA", "We need updates", "You do realize that if all you say is true, she will only find another way to divert attention to her. All of a sudden she may show up without her wheelchair, maybe she'll wear white, then with no wheelchair, she'll suddenly need it and not have it causing chaos. It may sound harsh but if she comes to your wedding, she will absolutely continue the tradition of ruining your events.", "Depending on the relationship you have with your in-laws, I would say to maybe warn them about sister's behavior in advance. Hopefully they're supportive and will keep you distracted if your family ignores you for her, and won't give in if sister tries to pull them in. If you have a dj, let them know. I've heard of good djs that will cut the mic or turn up music to drown out someone who isn't supposed to make a speech/announcement.\n\nIf I were there, and she tried announcing sad news to me, I'd be like \"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that, I hope things work out for you. Anyway, did you have a chance to try the cake? It's amazing, I have to know where the happy couple got it from\" or bring up some other topic that isn't important. Politely acknowledge, then change the subject to anything but her to show that she's not the priority.\n\nAnd PLEASE update!", "If you have her sizes, pack a bag of non-white dress clothes for her just incase. If she shows up in white \u201coh look you can change or go home\u201d", "Updates", "Yep, make them get it out of their system early", "We neeeeeed them!", "OK, look, I'm sorry about your sister but also you're pretty clearly mixing up your feelings about that and this. Without knowing your sister I have no clue if that was avoidable or whether she should be receiving treatment she's not getting but there's still a fairly obvious difference between that and saying you might need a wheelchair.", "Good! Don't be like me! I could have been on 1000 ways to die, or I could have been used in a medical drama lol!", "Checked mine. It\u2019s on the floor where I left it but I no longer trust it.", "I think that you missed the point of the glass child phenomena.  While obviously, it is reasonable that \u201cDaddy always carried\u201d the disabled twin, but remember that the glass child was also a /child/ who was still developing and from their perspective was always seen as not worthy of as much attention.  Children don\u2019t handle that well, and it takes a lot of active work on the parents (who can frequently be stretched thin by the needs of the disabled child) to counteract.  It\u2019s difficult for all involved, and doesn\u2019t mitigate the challenges the disabled child goes through", "Wouldn\u2019t they be considered more of a \u2018black sheep\u2019 than a \u2019scapegoat\u2019? \ud83e\udd14 Or it could be a bit of both in this situation.\n\nEither way, they have the best wool!", "But what about the disabled kids who's siblings took the limelight so the disabled kid is the one fending for themselves with everyone because the disability is used as an excuse why the other child needs more attention then the disabled child?", "This sounds way too much like me. Switch lung cancer to breast cancer and it is me. I empathize.", "Get the help you need.\n\nMy situation was nothing like yours. Mine was far easier, but it was as if they didn't see me for who I was. But I turned out so much better than my older sister and my younger one was too young to count at the time and I love her dearly.", "For you and everyone else discussing how you relate to this,I'm going to link the original video of the Ted talk here so it may help watching with yours and others situations similar. [Original Video Of The Glass Child Ted Talk](https://youtu.be/MSwqo-g2Tbk?si=R1QgssyCmNudXIOx)", "I'm really looking forward to how sister reacts to the silent prayer thing. It seems like it's about time she was put in check, and maybe this will do it", "1. Have a bridesmaid 'oops' a glass of red wine on the dress.\n2. Have a wheelchair on site \"Hey, sis, I knew you would try to be tough and not succeed, so we have a wheelchair for you here\"", "It's been like 30 minutes, dude", "*Grey's Anatomy has entered the chat.*", "Right? What if it moves to a shelf? What if it snakes its cord out of the cover?", "*stares at six active sewing machines* Crud, I'm in trouble.", "The scapegoat is almost always able to go by black sheep as well. I am able to use all three terms despite being disabled myself because my disability wasn\u2019t \u201cas bad\u201d as my brother\u2019s was", "Right I wasn't saying I don't see both sides or your side to it,just that this was the technical term someone came up for it so based on definition alone it wouldn't fit. The person who this originated from was a lady who spoke at a Ted talk about how she grew up as a \"glass child\" and her brother had autism. Your situation you described yourself in also happens to a lot of people in your situation,which I can imagine is also very difficult and deserves to be heard and understood as well. I hear you,and I also see you\u2665\ufe0f", "Thanks it feels good to know I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s going through something like this.\n\nETA- I\u2019m sorry for you situation. I hope you feel better in the future and good luck with your journey.", "I\u2019m definitely getting the help I need. I wish I had got it sooner, but at least I\u2019m getting it now. Mental health was a huge taboo in my family as I\u2019m sure you can deduce. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t too late when I started to get help but almost was at one point(I tried to od on medication 3 times but unsuccessfully thanks to my wife quickly calling 911). At least my wife understands my mental health issues and she loves me for who I am and supports the fact that I need help. I\u2019m so lucky to have her in my life, it\u2019s been the best 7 years. I wish when I met her 15 years ago I realized how great she was and had tried harder to make things work with her at that time. But it wasn\u2019t our time back then, and if I had stuck with her at that time I\u2019m sure she would have seen me as some kind of demon and wanted nothing to do with me at some point. So it was better we took the time apart that we did and tried again a few years later.", "OP, if you have a Goodwill near you, sometimes they have cheap wheelchairs - though it may need a bit of repair work. We recently bought one for my husband's grandmother for like $50. One wheel is missing and the seat is a little worn, but that's pretty easy to repair.", "If not a wheelchair, a rolling office chair will do. And the mom can then push her around, since she\u2019s the enabler anyway. Lol. \n\nSeriously though. A simple rolling office chair is a great substitute wheelchair in emergencies. My husband used one to get my almost unconscious ass from my apartment to the car, to take me to the hospital.", "> Have a bridesmaid 'oops' a glass of red wine on the dress.\n\nJust make sure she doesn't have telekinesis and you're good.", "Thanks, dude", "I\u2019m never gonna sleep again.
