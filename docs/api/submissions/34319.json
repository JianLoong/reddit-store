I am going to call my sister Anna. Anna got cancer when she was 15 and was able to beat it. Ever since she has been having growths and anytime one appears we are worried about the cancer coming back. \n\nMy issue is that she always makes these announcements that she needs to go to the doctors again at the worst times. At the beginning I thought it was just bad timing but it has happened so many time when I hit a milestone. My graduations, my birthdays, my engagement party. Anytime she makes an announcement she needs to go back to the hospital my whole family with flock to her.\n\nI have had my birthday dinner turn into my relatives flocking to her for the whole night.\n\nI had a dinner party to announce my wedding  date for my relatives. It was going so great and it was a fun time until Anna told mom she needs to go back to the hospital. Soon everyone forgot about the reason for the dinner party and it was quiet. My aunt even stepped in to do a pray for Anna. Another event was taken over. I went low contact with her after that.\n\nShe was invited to the wedding and it is in two weeks. I learned today she is in a on and off in a wheelchair from my mom/Anna. She will need to take it just in case for the wedding. I asked if the rest of the family was informed and she told me no. I told both of them they need to inform them. They told me they don\u2019t want to worry them and won\u2019t do that.\n\nI had enough and told them you need to tell before my wedding. Again a no. I then informed them Anna is not invited. \n\nThis started a huge argument about how I\u2019m a dick and my point is that I am sick of her stealing the spotlight. That what will happen if she rolls in with a wheelchair.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to do a mass blast to all my relatives, saying she is in a wheelchair and unsure if she will be able to make it to my wedding, keep my sister in their thoughts and prayers.\n\nI\u2019m gettin ahead of this.", "created_utc": 1704391733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yjla9/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_at_my_wedding/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A little strange that she always makes that kind of announcement in that situation, anyway praying for her,You'll probably regret it if she doesn't attend anyway", "I would have a conversation with sister and say I feel that every time I have a special event, you choose that time to share with family and friends your medical issues. I feel this is something you share outside of these events. I feel that when the celebration should be about my milestone events it becomes focused on you instead. \nMaybe say to her due to the event venue at my wedding I feel it necessary to let our family members know that you may or may not require more patience as you use things like ramps, elevators etc with your wheelchair. \nSomething like there will be guests who may require the use of ramps and elevators. The wedding venue has asked guests to have patience and to inform them of the number of guests who require accessibility services as some of these things require a specific key.  If you send out a general note of the venue has accessibility features and that there will be guests in attendance who may have need of them, maybe it will take some of the need of the sister to have the spot light on her\n\nI guess it depends on if OP wants to keep the relationship close with sibling or not.  \nUltimately the OP gets to decide on the guest list. \nIt's tricky to navigate and weddings can bring out the worst in people.", "YTA\n\nEver consider, I don't know, talking to your sister before just kicking her out of your wedding?  Maybe saying to her 'listen, you're my sister and I love you but I've noticed XYZ...this day is really important to me so can we talk about anything that you want to talk about, say, the night before?'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr hey, be a grownup and tell your guests yourself.\n\nBut no, you jump right to the nuclear solution.  Easier to just trash your family relationships than have a conversation.  Good job.", "Maybe if you pray real hard you will get cancer and be wheelchair bound on your wedding day and then you can have the whole spotlight.  /s\n\nYTA", "Yes. Weddings are stupid affairs and cancer is a life or death affair. Your discomfort means nothing next to hers.", "NTA.\n\nIf you do decide to let her come, put a comms out to the other guests, saying that your sister will likely need to use a wheelchair for some or all of the day, and that she's a bit sensitive about it so please can people avoid commenting on it or talking about it. That'll puncture her balloon!", "YTA.  But own that shit.  Send out a mass blast to the whole wedding list that your sister isn't doing well again, that you're concerned she might not be able to make the wedding, and even if she can she'll likely be in a wheel chair.  But you know she loves you and she wouldn't want her illness to disrupt your special day.\n\nAnd for bonus points, hold a moment of silent prayer for her health during youe reception speeches. Lean into that shit.", "NTA given that the problem actually the attention-grabbing behavior.  However, there's no good way to avoid it by uninviting her because it sounds like your family will either bring her anyway and dare you to kick her out or spend the whole time bitching about it.  I like the suggestion of another poster that you contact the other guests for \"accommodation\" purposes and deal with the apparent blowback from your family with that.  \n\nHowever in the future, it's best just not to invite people who have demonstrated that they will try to grab the spotlight any way they can.  Interrupting your major events half the time to announce some new issue is deliberate.", "Your sister announces everything medically related to everyone all the time, why being suddenly quiet about it right now? Probably to annouce something bad to everyone in the middle of the reception maybe? Something doesn't feel right indeed !\n\nNTA", "Nta\nBut consider even her non presence will draw attention as many will want to know why she isn't there. And if she is \"ok health wise\". So, will your mom get the bulk of the questions and attention since it sounds like she is in the \"know\"? Just a thought.", "NTA I saw your edit. Do that. I am sorry that your sister is sick but it is not fair that the lives of all family members are her personal show.", "NTA\n\nShe knows what she's doing. \n\nYou can be confident she has a special announcement planned for the wedding. \n\nWould have been better to not invite her at all, but this is still a wise move.", "NTA. I feel so bad for you. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to show up and surprise everyone with the wheelchair.", "Disinviting her will make the wedding about her as well. \n\nIt certainly sounds like she dislikes the spotlight being on you. A lot of it might be resentment from you not having the real medical issues that she has had. She probably needs therapy. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I would tell your parents that if she hijacks the wedding as you suspect she will, you\u2019re going to go zero contact with her and she won\u2019t be welcome at any future events or milestones. Let them know what you think is going to happen. If you\u2019re wrong, then you get the wedding day you want. If you\u2019re right, then you won\u2019t have to deal with it any more. \n\nEither way I hope you post an update.", "How sad that you think she will take up all of the spotlight.  You are having a marriage.  Not a wedding.  There is no need to have all the attention.  In the era of social media everyone craves attention and the spotlight.  What about craving kindness, grace, maturity?   What does attention even give you? It\u2019s momentary.  Marriage is the real goal.  And it should be about kindness, grace, understanding.", "ESH- you are for not wanting her there because she might be in a wheelchair. Her, because some of these things are a little too much of a coincidence to be occurring every time you have a milestone. My guess is she's depressed and sad that she's not also reaching similar milestones. (I'm assuming.) But also, as a chronic illness patient- some of this really is just a coincidence. We can't control when our bodies fall apart or flair up.", "Nta , sounds like she specifically correlates her \u201cneed \u201c to let people know she\u2019s sick with every opportunity you have for get-together or party.", "This has to be fake", "INFO: Is there any reason you can't inform your wedding guests yourself?Just a text saying \"Just a heads up!

Who happens to be your own sister. \n\nI hope your entire family boycotts your wedding.", "NTA. \n\nIts hard having a sick sibling, especially if that sibling gets a taste for the attention they receive. Honestly I understand not inviting her and I would feel much the same way you do if she had a habit of hijacking my big moments.", "This didn't happen. and I'm tired of people like you posting bs like this to make people with disabilities out to be villains.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is clearly manipulative and your parents are clearly hellbent on enabling her.\n\nThey \"don't want your relatives to worry\" but have no problem with completely eclipsing your big day with news?\n\nGuess we know where your sister gets it from.\n\nAny way you could inform the family yourself, about the wheelchair?", "NTA. If you were banning Anna solely for using the wheelchair it would be Y T A.
