Anyway, hi. I'm 28F, and getting divorced from my soon to be ex husband(32M). We were married for 8 years, together for 10. Two years into our marriage my ex broached the subject of an open relationship. He traveled a lot, often for months at a time (it was legitimate work stuff that I knew about going in, this isn't about that), and, well, he had needs. I asked for some time, thought about it, and agreed. Truth be told I was in love with just about everything but the sex anyway. To an extent we both were. We were kinda best friends who wanted to have kids together and who liked the benefits of living together, and maybe that should have been a flag but hindsight, y'know?\n\nAnyway, I agreed to an open relationship but made it clear to him that he had to understand that if he was going to have partners, I would too. He agreed, and we made it work for a good five\\~ years. Three years ago my sister found out (she's a snooper and I left my phone unlocked near her, separate issue), and laughed at me and told me that open relationships were for guys and that he'd leave me when he found out I was sleeping with other people. I told her to fuck off and get out, and she did, though she's made it her running joke (\"Has he dumped you yet or are you just pretending you don't have other people?\")\n\nWell, last year I was at a party and discovered that I am...not straight. I've had a couple female partners now and I told my husband about one of them (this is normal for us, we don't get explicit but we talk about people we've been with). This was, apparently, a bridge too far for him and after I couldn't commit to never sleeping with another woman again (separate issue) he decided the marriage was over.\n\nAll this context is for the actual issue at hand. I do *not* want to hear opinions on my marriage, this is just a history. Now that this is happening, my sister is demanding that I apologize to her and maybe take her to dinner because I've been getting mad at her for three years. My argument is mostly 'fuck off' with a side-note of \"He's mad I'm bi or something, not that I slept with other people\".\n\nTo my absolute mortification, my sister has now dragged our parents into this mess, and they're telling me my sister *was* right and so I *do* owe her an apology because she was just looking out for me.

I\u2019m struggling to work out from your sisters stand point why she needs an apology so badly after making you feel like shit for so long, rather than actually looking out for you by looking after to you?", "NTA and no need to apologize because her information was based on invading your privacy and you never asked for her opinion.", "It doesn't matter whether she was right or wrong. Why was she taking pleasure in criticising your marriage? Why is she taking pleasure in your marriage breakdown? She has no emotional maturity if her response to your marriage breakdown is 'haha, told you so, now apologise to me and pay me'. This says more about her than you. You need to not waste time on people who make you feel shitty. \n\nAnd she wasn't right anyway. Congrats on finding yourself. Enjoy exploring more without a bi-shaming husband dragging you down. \n\nNTA", "NTA, not the same reason. But bloody hell, what's wrong with your sister? Is she a narcissist or something?   \nDo your parents know that she snoops through your things, inserts her unsolicited advice and criticisms, makes jokes about your private life and demands apologies where none are warranted? If anyone should be apologising it should be your sister. Wtf is wrong with her?", "NTA. She should still be apologising for snooping. \nA married couple's life is no one else's business.", "I never apologize even when I'm wrong", "NTA. People who say mean things and then argue \"I'm just being honest\"; in reality they're being jerks and not minding their own business while being judgmental.", "Nta. Who even cares if she was right you didn't ask for her beak in your business", "NTA. First, she wasn't right, and also, she was downright nasty.", "Yeah I think this is the main reason although I don't understand it (I'd be more uncomfortable/threatened by her male partners and yes I know it's stupid but it's what I feel). On of my conditions would be to have closed up the marriage once he stops travelling unless both agree to kep it open.\n\nAs far as Sis's argument about open relationships being for guys, this is rubbish - women find it far easier to attract male partners than men do female partners. Not sure why this is but seen it so many times with friends who have done the online dating thing.", "The compulsion being disrespect.", "I mean wasnt it kind of you who had the harem? LOL NTA", "My word, your sister sounds like she\u2019s a perpetual toddler and your parents are endorsing her childish behaviour.

You don\u2019t belittle someone\u2019s marriage ending and you sure as heck don\u2019t go to your parents because you\u2019re a spoiled little snoop. I\u2019d maintain what you\u2019ve been saying.

I just have one thing to add;\n\nLet's imagine you were still happily married with your ex, at which point would you have been \"right\" in your sisters opinion?! This sort of \"I bet this boat will sink!\" expectation is disregarding and disrespectful imo. You were married for 8 years, and for 6 of them you guys made the open relationship work SUCCESSFULLY! And for all the years your sister claimed to know that you'll break up... How fkn rude can you be to sorta bet on your sisters marriage to fail?!?! And even more: to rub it in your face for years during and, even more, AFTER your marriage... ?! If you have a \"supportive\" sister like that, you certainly don't need enemies anymore...", "You're NTA, but your sister and parents definitely are. Who sees someone's marriage falling apart and demands an apology for being \"right\" about it not working out? Has your sister ever heard about compassion or tact? Even if she thinks she was right (although she isn't, given what you're describing), there's no need for her to focus on that when you're already dealing with so much. The fact your parents are supporting her over this rather than telling her to back off is awful. I'm sorry that the people who should have your back right now are more focused on \"I told you so\"s than comforting you through a divorce.", "YTA   \nYou'll admit to a bunch of strangers on the internet that you think she's right but you'll risk damaging your relationship with her and your family permanently .... for what?", "What kind of grown immature AH drags parents into something like this, giving out your private/intimate info? Just to get an apology for something she wasn't even right about? I'm honestly baffled.\n\nWhat an absolute child. You are definitely NTA.\nIf it were me, I'd go NC with her. Not only did she invade your privacy by going through your phone, but she further invaded that privacy your PARENTS what she saw without your pernission, AND bullied you for 3 years over what she saw.", "NTA, but your sister is. Geez, what a selfish righteous biatch. Instead of caring about you and what you might be going through she only wants to prove she was right? And your parents agree?

Are you flippin kidding me??? \n\nSo even if your sister is 100% \"right\", that makes how she's acting even worse. Remind her that just like your wedding to him, and your marriage to him, your divorce IS NOT ABOUT HER!!  \n\nYou are NTA and your sister needs therapy for her disordered attention seeking.", "It is entirely possible to be both right and an arsehole, as your sister is showing.

And absolutely disgusting to involve your parents where she herself had no business sticking her nose in.", "NTA and what your sister is looking for is validation on her bad behaviour. People need to keep their noses out of other people's relationships. I'm sorry you have gone through this as it seems like your husband is biologic You cant have your cake and eat it. He gets to be with whoever but you have rules.", "NTA. At all. Good on you  for trying something you thought might benefit your relationship. With a partner who had similar motivations and values to you, this could have worked out well.

You\u2019ll attract other likeminded people that way. I\u2019m rooting for you and hope you get to have the cake you\u2019d like to eat.

Most can get at least one guy a day if they wanted.", "Please y'all go easy on the downvotes. \n\nI wouldn't say he is biphobic, he just not comfortable with the whole thing. Not everyone is okay with it and yeah there was disagreement. But I advice opie to not apologize just yet, for her sister was still being a poke noser, teasing and making fun of her. Not cool.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong by saying that opie is not free to do what she wants in an open relationship, he should have been more mindful.", "Your parents are enablers. Therapy isn\u2019t going to help if her family doesn\u2019t hold her accountable for unhealthy behaviors.

They can work and they are non of her business. Even if he did get upset about you having other partners she's still wrong to assume they never work out. I have two separate set of friends who are in open relationships and one set have been so for ten years. Your sister is wrong and mean.", "You said you've spoken about other people you've been with, right? It's literally just because that one was a woman. So, no, she's not right, and they're both bigots and you don't owe anyone an apology of any kind. NTA", "From what your saying she's not right though. He didn't dump you because you were seeing other people, it was because your bi. Which is wierd, I think most guys would be more comfortable with woman on woman action then another guy railing their wife.", "NTA, but your sister was right. It just wasn't her business; you don't owe her an apology. She will have I told you so over you forever though, and you're gonna have to take that on the chin.", "She was kind of right, partially. When you do an open relationship you run into a bit of jealousy. Men take this as a hit to their ego. Like he wasnt enough. Easier to compete with other men rather than other women. I would call a truce because in the end, does it really matter? You will honestly be happier living your true self. When it comes to family this is just not worth the argument. I would have a girls night out with her and destress over the whole situation. Who cares really who is right or wrong. I always think to myself, is this worth it? What am I getting from being right? Is it important? Nah not really. You found yourself along to way and maybe this will lead to something beautiful later on. Its not worth ruining your relationship with your sister. Just say okay fine you're right, but next time stay off my phone and being nosey! But nicely \ud83d\udc4c", "NTA. And she *isn't* right. Your husband didn't decide your marriage was over because you were sleeping with other people. He decided it was over because he didn't want you sleeping with *women*.\n\nYour STBX is narrow-minded, your sister is petty, and you deserve better than both of them.", "Oh my god NTA NTA NTA what the fuck is wrong with your sister!? She was rude about legitimate and reasonable choices made within your marriage for years and is now rubbing that rudeness in your face when your marriage has broken down only because your ex is a literal homophobe.

Exactly.\n\nYour parents taking her side tells you all you should know.\n\nJust shut them out, because its clearly not helping.\nI hope you have friends to turn to who do care about your suffering.\n\nAnyways good luck with the divorce. You'll get through this \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\n\nOh and if it wasnt clear enough already; NTA", "Definitely NTA. Your relationship should be the concern of you and your ex husband and no one else. \n\nYou were doing nothing demonstrably damaging to your health or others and it was consensual between both parties. \n\nYour sister sounds like she loves drama and to insert herself where she is not wanted or needed. \n\nI'm sorry the marriage ended, but power to you for standing by tlyour choices and preferences and not submitting to hubby's insecurities.  \n\nAs for your parents, I'm quite sure your sister has painted herself as some kind of saviour/martyr in the scenario. Again, none of this should be their business except to care and support you what must be a difficult time. \n\nMy personal approach would be to tell my family this topic of conversation is completely off limits and if anyone tries to approach it, immediately leave without comment and not engage.

You shouldn't apologize. Everybody has dated an asshole. Get your divorce and keep it pushing.", "I don\u2019t think you owe your sister anything cuz she was a fucking dick about it. Like maybe if she was sensitive and like \u201cdo you wanna talk about it\u201d sure but she made jokes at your expense the entire time. That isn\u2019t nice or helpful. She can suck it. Don\u2019t apologize.", "NTA. Your husband is obviously biphobic, but frankly your sister and family are being biphobic too.

PS. Congrats on figuring out you're not straight!", "NTA Your sister sounds insufferable.", "NTA. Your sister sounds obnoxious.

I'm sorry I left my phone unlocked near a person I thought I could trust more than any other in my life. I'm sorry that you took that opportunity to violate my trust in you by looking through MY personal property. I'm terribly sorry you take such demented pleasure from my failed marriage. I am also very sorry you have taken such personal information and gleefully relayed it to our parents.\n\nI am sorry I've learned all of this about you because it has forever changed my idea of what our relationship was, and I'll never trust you again.

She sounds a bit immature. When you have been through life and relationships, lifes ups and downs, you learn a thing or 2. She sounds like she might be the youngest in your family? Parents tend to baby that one the longest. They should be giving her advice on how not to be so condescending and more supportive.
