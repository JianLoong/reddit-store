Anyway, hi. I'm 28F, and getting divorced from my soon to be ex husband(32M). We were married for 8 years, together for 10. Two years into our marriage my ex broached the subject of an open relationship. He traveled a lot, often for months at a time (it was legitimate work stuff that I knew about going in, this isn't about that), and, well, he had needs. I asked for some time, thought about it, and agreed. Truth be told I was in love with just about everything but the sex anyway. To an extent we both were. We were kinda best friends who wanted to have kids together and who liked the benefits of living together, and maybe that should have been a flag but hindsight, y'know?\n\nAnyway, I agreed to an open relationship but made it clear to him that he had to understand that if he was going to have partners, I would too. He agreed, and we made it work for a good five\\~ years. Three years ago my sister found out (she's a snooper and I left my phone unlocked near her, separate issue), and laughed at me and told me that open relationships were for guys and that he'd leave me when he found out I was sleeping with other people. I told her to fuck off and get out, and she did, though she's made it her running joke (\"Has he dumped you yet or are you just pretending you don't have other people?\")\n\nWell, last year I was at a party and discovered that I am...not straight. I've had a couple female partners now and I told my husband about one of them (this is normal for us, we don't get explicit but we talk about people we've been with). This was, apparently, a bridge too far for him and after I couldn't commit to never sleeping with another woman again (separate issue) he decided the marriage was over.\n\nAll this context is for the actual issue at hand. I do *not* want to hear opinions on my marriage, this is just a history. Now that this is happening, my sister is demanding that I apologize to her and maybe take her to dinner because I've been getting mad at her for three years. My argument is mostly 'fuck off' with a side-note of \"He's mad I'm bi or something, not that I slept with other people\".\n\nTo my absolute mortification, my sister has now dragged our parents into this mess, and they're telling me my sister *was* right and so I *do* owe her an apology because she was just looking out for me.  I'm not convinced, but she actually was right, technically, so do I need to apologize to her?", "created_utc": 1681329293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jwx0c/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_sister_since_she/", "score": 274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't let aholes like your sister get the better of you at a time when you are vulnerable. Its not worth the time to be with them. Definitely not the Ahole here. \n\nHope you are having a good day as of now, and if not, there will be brighter days soon.", "YTA.  If your sister wants a dinner out of you, just buy her a nice dinner.  Then laugh together about what happened.  Why bear grudges? Why are you so adamant about who's right or wrong.  If you want to be right all the time, it must be difficult to talk to you, let alone working/ living with you.", "NTA. I\u2019m struggling to work out from your sisters stand point why she needs an apology so badly after making you feel like shit for so long, rather than actually looking out for you by looking after to you?", "NTA and no need to apologize because her information was based on invading your privacy and you never asked for her opinion.", "It doesn't matter whether she was right or wrong. Why was she taking pleasure in criticising your marriage? Why is she taking pleasure in your marriage breakdown? She has no emotional maturity if her response to your marriage breakdown is 'haha, told you so, now apologise to me and pay me'. This says more about her than you. You need to not waste time on people who make you feel shitty. \n\nAnd she wasn't right anyway. Congrats on finding yourself. Enjoy exploring more without a bi-shaming husband dragging you down. \n\nNTA", "NTA, not the same reason. But bloody hell, what's wrong with your sister? Is she a narcissist or something?   \nDo your parents know that she snoops through your things, inserts her unsolicited advice and criticisms, makes jokes about your private life and demands apologies where none are warranted? If anyone should be apologising it should be your sister. Wtf is wrong with her?", "NTA. She should still be apologising for snooping. \nA married couple's life is no one else's business.", "I never apologize even when I'm wrong", "NTA. People who say mean things and then argue \"I'm just being honest\"; in reality they're being jerks and not minding their own business while being judgmental.", "Nta. Who even cares if she was right you didn't ask for her beak in your business", "NTA. First, she wasn't right, and also, she was downright nasty.", "Yeah I think this is the main reason although I don't understand it (I'd be more uncomfortable/threatened by her male partners and yes I know it's stupid but it's what I feel). On of my conditions would be to have closed up the marriage once he stops travelling unless both agree to kep it open.\n\nAs far as Sis's argument about open relationships being for guys, this is rubbish - women find it far easier to attract male partners than men do female partners. Not sure why this is but seen it so many times with friends who have done the online dating thing.", "The compulsion being disrespect.", "I mean wasnt it kind of you who had the harem? LOL NTA"]}
