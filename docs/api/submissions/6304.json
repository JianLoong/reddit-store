As a husband, I feel confident saying that your husband sounds selfish and childish. This issue is bigger than chore distribution as exemplified by his snide remark about your age.

He\u2019s literally saying that not be expected to do any chores is more important to him than being married to you. \n\nLet him wear dirty underwear. Let him wear it until he gets some sort of infection and until his friends and coworkers comment on his smell and he has to justify to other people that he\u2019s wearing disgusting clothing because he\u2019s upset that his wife expects him to do ANY of the housework. \n\nCook a single portion of food, eat it and then do your own clean up. Put a lock and key on the bathroom door so you\u2019re able to clean up your own space and he can use the spare one to his heart\u2019s content. Of course you can\u2019t do this with everything but, anything that can be individualised, should he. \n\nAlternatively, just scrap the whole husband - if having a mommy instead of a wife is more important to him, let him have it, he didn\u2019t represent himself accurately before you were married. \n\nNTA.", "INFO:  Do you both work full-time?\n\nRegardless - \n\nWearing stinky underwear is just gross.\n\nThe remark that you're getting older but he still has a lot of time to have kids (so do you btw) honestly sounds like a veiled threat that he'll leave if you stick to your guns about waiting until he's contributing 50% of the household tasks.", "NTA you\u2019re basically his mom, or bang mate. You\u2019re going to be single mother if you decide to have kids with this man. Leave!", "ESH\n\nStop holding on to someone like that and hitting your head against a wall so all you have left is complaints. He tricked you and no Magic words are going to change him. Leave him.", "NTA and this isn\u2019t worth the mental load. Say goodbye", "NTA. The comment about how you're \"old\" is enough to prove he's a worthless person.", "NTA. Do not bring children into this dynamic.", "NTA\n\nPlease don't have children with this man, it seems like it will only get worse from here.", "NTA   \nyou know? He is right, dont wait on him, kick him out, get a man that respects you and helps you instead of leeching on you", "NTA. Anyone who would rather pull dirty underwear out of the laundry and wear it, vs making a minimal effort to take responsibility for at least his own clothes, is not someone who will be a good parenting partner.

Big time. You\u2019re old at 28? Fuck that loser and leave.  It won\u2019t change when the kid comes. Find someone good for you.\n\nFYI my mom had me at 38. That\u2019s such an unnecessary and rude thing to say even if it was just a moment of anger. Just fuckin awful", "Divorce this manipulative, lying, bullying toad now.  DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN WITH IT.", "NTA you definitely don\u2019t want kids with this asshat", "NTA and seriously your options are either marriage counseling or divorce. If that\u2019s his attitude, it won\u2019t work. If anything he\u2019ll pull another bait and switch - do 50% of the chores to get you on board and you better believe as soon as a child is born YOU will be changing all the diapers and doing all the midnight feedings\n\nPS: my wife and I had a similar conversation recently but with things like finances, household paperwork, etc. I usually handle all of it but finally told her that I was feeling overwhelmed and needed her to be more involved. Her response was \u201coh, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know you felt that way. What can I take off your plate or what can we tackle together so you aren\u2019t doing it alone\u201d.

Rewearing dirty underwear to avoid running a load of laundry? Yuck.", "Sounds like sex would also be a UTI lottery if he is re-wearing underwear.  NTA it will get worse if you have a kid - he needs to be onboard as a partner and as a father", "NTA\n\nI love that you made a spreadsheet for this, that's something I would do hahahahahaha", "NTA. Nothing like a good spreadsheet to show the truth. Dump him and move on. He is a deadbeat husband who will become a deadbeat dad.", "Do you both share bills as well?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t trust him to change after he pulled the bait and switch on you the first time. He\u2019ll do it again, and then you\u2019ll be stuck with this guy as the father of your children. You know what they say, fool me once\u2026", "ESH. List keeping is weird and this dude sucks. Please don't have children.", "ESH. you making a spreadsheet IS kinda psycho, and he's a jerk. Divorce before you two make kids, and complicate things.", "Exactly. He thinks he has you trapped (by marriage and your own biological clock), he basically said as much. Leave NOW.", "This is the way, OP!\n\nNTA", "Yes. They're incompatible with the kind of mutual resentment that's absolute death to happiness. With this kind of dynamic so early in a relationship, it's only going to get more miserable from here.

The fact that he stopped quite suddenly after they got married shows that he knows exactly what he is doing, and it isn't a matter of being unaware of the domestic load. It's unfortunately common for guys to be unhelpful around the house and stubbornly misguided about it. That kind of perspective could theoretically be changed by the use of a chore chart or a sheet like OP's. But this kind of behaviour is way more purposeful and manipulative. The fact that he quite deliberately waited until she'd been \"locked in\", and would say such a nasty thing to her to boot, makes me sus that this guy isn't abusive in addition to being a lazy pig.", "100% guanatee he won't!
