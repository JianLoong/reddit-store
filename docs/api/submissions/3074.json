I mean don\u2019t expect his adult son to give you respect when y\u2019all closer in age. Move on", "EXACTLY she wouldnt have a baby if shed have done this at my wedding", "I appreciate your input, thank you!", "Thank you!", "That's what I thought as well but I wanted to make sure.", "Thank you. I felt that since I wasn't being respected my presence at their baby shower wasn't needed or wanted", "It's just a basic one car garage but cleaned it up well. We had enough room for all our guests. It wasn't very big due the fact we both were married before and didn't want anything too elaborate. We also have a decent sized yard so some guests were outside enjoying the weather.", "I do appreciate your input, thank you!", " NTA. It was spiteful and an AH move", "If I could go back 3 years and do that I absolutely would. So many hours tracking down addresses and filling out envelopes. So much money spent on invites for more than half the RSVP\u2019s to come back declined (thanks covid). But I was told anything less than paper invites would be rude. Emails all the way from now on!", "Well and while you were cutting the cake?! Super weird timing", "She's claiming that's when she handed us the invite but that didn't happen at all. Honestly, that makes it even worse in my opinion.", "NTA- they are & her mother is too. Tell them they can't have they're wedding ir reception in your garage, because you're going to be washing your car or something. But then I'll admit i can get petty. ......So stupid!", "NTA.  Stepson and his wife are the AH's.  I cannot think of a way to be on good terms with people whose manners are as lacking as the manners of these two.  Suggest you concentrate your efforts on staying on the same page as your new husband.", "Ewww\u2026 that\u2019s so cringe on their part. I\u2019d be mad as hell for them to do that mess, I bet whoever said that was acceptable also wears white to others peoples weddings, and tries to take home leftovers in ziplock bags in their purse? \n\nNTA!!", "Omg they saved a whole 5$ in postage. Soooo amazing.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut I am trying to figure out why they believed that claiming they gave you an invite while you were cutting the cake would be better. They seriously think that them interrupting one of the more important events in the wedding reception would have been better?????", "Also they chose a moment that the attention was supposed to be on you and your husband the cutting of the cake it was rude either way but way worse that they did it when you were trying to cut your cake", "NTA\n\nBut\u2026seriously if this is the biggest drama (not problem) in your life, you should count yourself lucky and get over it. It was rude. Fine. You now know they\u2019re rude and selfish. Probably immature. Do t forget that, but let the rest go. Enjoy being married. Your husband is going to be a grandfather, celebrate that together. Just let it go. There are so many problems in the world. This is honestly stupid to be so tied up in knots over.", "NTA\n\nI hope someone announces a pregnancy at THEIR wedding, goes into labour at their baby shower and dies at their funeral.\n\nSo tacky and I'd have been pissed.", "NTA. That ex is toxic. Draw some boundaries that work for you.", "NTA. It would have been okay to hand people their envelope as they left, but while you were cutting the damn cake? That's some Women's Network afternoon movie bullshit right there", "It\u2019s presumed people are going to bring gifts.  I want a tasteful invitation and something to eat and I\u2019ll bring a nice 50 gift", "You\u2019re less than 10 years older than \u201cstepson\u201d so that probably tainted any sort of relationship on his end. Your blood boils? You\u2019re 30. Get pregnant and invite people to your baby shower at their wedding. Or grow up. This is not the end of the world.\n\nETA: I just read your replies to comments. OP, this happened three years ago. It\u2019s time to move on! Seriously.", "You must have a nice, large, clean garage! I don't go in mine since my hubby has his crap everywhere & it's a pigsty.", "Seriously!  What, were they planning on putting a down payment on a house with the postage they saved, lol!", "It's called e-vite. \n\nEdit: Cleary NTA.", "She's as full grown woman, with a child, making a tik tok about her dirty laundry with her in-laws... just on that, you can assess the level of maturity and class.", "NTA. Rule of thumb: *Never* make another person\u2019s event about yourself. Just. No. Don\u2019t ask for permission. Don\u2019t do it. Just pay the gang postage for invites to your own dang event.", "NTA for sure, but I hate the word hubby", "NTA.", "But mummy dearest said it was ok /s"]}
