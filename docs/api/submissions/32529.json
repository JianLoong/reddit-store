My ex and I separated two years ago.  A year prior to the separation, she asked to have an open marriage. I agreed to try to make it work. Very quickly I realized that it couldn't work for me. I told her I needed our relationship to be monogamous. She told me that if she was limited to a monogamous relationship with me, she would \"be miserable for the rest of \\[her\\] life.\" Counseling didn't help, she told me she needed me to move out or else she'd have a mental health breakdown, so I moved out we've since divorced. \n\nAfter moving out, I started to see (with help from friends and my therapist) aspects of my relationship that had been very unhealthy, almost like having wool removed from my eyes. As a result, I felt more relief and peace from the divorce than grief. This made it very easy for me to move on, and I started dating my GF (37F) a couple months after the separation. I waited to tell my daughter about the new GF until it had been a full year since separation. My daughter and GF have a great relationship, but she is only 9 and I know this is hard and confusing for her. She does have a therapist she meets with 2x a month.\n\nMy GF and I are planning on getting married within the next year. This is the second marriage for both of us. My GF is concerned about her fertility and wants to have kids quickly. \n\nMy ex and I go to regular co-parenting counseling. I have kept her informed of our plans so that she doesn't hear any of the news through our kid (I have not told my daughter about the wedding plans yet). In response, my ex has told me that I am moving too fast and causing life-long harm to our daughter. She claims I am prioritizing my desires and my GF's timeline for marriage/kids over the well-being of our daughter. I think that the presence of my GF in our lives is positive for both me and my daughter, and I think my daughter will be an incredible older sister if I do have any more kids. But, I am starting to lose sleep at night over whether my ex is right, and if I'm causing serious harm to my daughter.

Tell your ex to butt out. What you do is your business not hers.", "NTA. It's really not the timeline that matters. You could find someone great in a matter of months, you could wait years and end up with an asshole.", "NTA. I think you are handling this well and very maturely.

It sounds like you are working on creating a healthy and happy family for your daughter. If you do not already have her in counselling, I would highly recommend you do to help her with the transition.\n\n\nAdditionally, it is important that your daughter feels that she is a valuable member of your new family. When you discuss your upcoming marriage with her discuss what will change and ask her what things she needs from you to be happy. Then keep talking and checking-in with monthly family meetings.\n\n\nI would also recommend that you privately talk to your fianc\u00e9 about what your blended family will look like. Will your daughter be allowed one on one time with you after you have more children? If your ex gives your daughter opportunities your other children don\u2019t have, how will you manage it?

Your Ex tries to manipulate you.\n\nBut maybe talk to a therapist yourself, get some tips how to tell your daughter. Maybe it would help if you ask her, if it would be okay for her. That you love your new girlfriend and want to marry her but you still want her (your daughters) approval (so she would be part of the decission making). Also talk to your girlfriend and your daugther what they want to be part of the others live - like does  your daughter want your girlfriend just as 'dads new wife', as 'a relative but not a motherly typ', as a step mother or even as a second mother role in her live. She is 9 years old, it might change in the future. But involving her in the decission might help the relationship as well as not letting her feel, like she is replaced by your new family", "\u201cShe claims I am prioritizing my desires.\u201d\n\nLike she did?

Yea, I think it is a bit soon. Your kid is still likely trying to adapt to this new life...and now you and your gf/fianc\u00e9e want to rush more kids into the mix?

If I read this right, you were separated a full year before future stepmom entered the picture, and up to a year after THAT is when you plan to marry. So between 1 and 2 years after being separated, you're not moving too fast.\n\nAlso, the whole \"I need an open marriage now or I'll be miserable or we divorce\" is a very thinly veiled translation of \"I'm not happy with this marriage and I already have a guy lined up to sleep with but need to validate it before I just start cheating on my spouse.\" If she really cared about how the adult relationships would affect her child, she really should have thought of that before throwing away over a decade of marriage. \n\nThe only person you're being any kind of asshole to is your ex, but even that's only because you're doing what is best for YOU and YOUR household instead of thinking about what she wants.

I have also talked about it with the co-parenting counselor, who is a child psychiatrist. I have not talked with my daughter's therapist about it. Her therapist will only communicate with me with both parents present (e.g. emails to both me and my ex). Since I try to limit my interactions with my ex and I have advice from two other professionals, no, I have not sent a joint email to my daughter's therapist and my ex on this issue.
