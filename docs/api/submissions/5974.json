According to him, all documents have a digital version and that is enough, not all are digital (passport) and not all places accept the digital form, but he is stubborn and maintains this position. I don't mind being responsible for the documents and most of the time, I have them in my purse. \n\nThat is until one day (2 months ago) he called me asking about his identity, because he needed it for something and they didn't accept the digital version, I was at work and I informed him that I had with me. He gave me a huge scolding, saying that their documents should be at home and told me to stop \"holding\" his documents. I handed his documents over to him and said that I would no longer be responsible for this or warn him about it, because I was doing a favor for someone I love who is a capable adult (27). \n\nFor the situation: \n\nWe and our friends decided to travel to another country on New Years from the 12/27-01/03 and a passport is needed as it is on another continent. We would go to the capital where we would stay at our friend's house until our flight time. Our city is 2 hours away.\n\nWe decided to go to the airport 4 hours before (visit the VIP room) and I went to check all my documents first. Paul was on my side and when he saw only one passport, he asked about his and I just said \"You have it\". \n\nHe panicked, saying he thought I had taken even more passports as usual and left it at home. He decided to run home and come back, he asked me to go with him but I didn't want to spend 4 hours in the car. He went to get his passport (but complained that this was something to remember him by) and I went with my friends to the airport.\n\n In short, he didn't arrive on time and I decided I wouldn't miss my trip because of him. I turned off my cell phone and made my 12h trip. \n\nWhen I arrived, several messages from him saying that he couldn't believe that I had gone on a trip without him and that I had done it as forms of revenge because of his scolding. The flights are all booked up or too expensive, so he probably won't come. He's still accusing me of leaving him behind after purposely not remember something I know he struggles with. \n\nMy friends are on my side, but I feel doubtful. \n\nAITA?\n\nI forgot one detail: I always make a list for our trips of what to take, his passport was on the list and he still forgot it", "created_utc": 1672365862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zynue3/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_behind_and_going_on/", "score": 10972, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I must say that living your daily life with important documents in your purse is crazy. They can be lost or stolen. His passport should have been at home the whole time.

Why should you miss on a expensive trip of the life time? Hopefully he won't make the same mistake twice...

It's not about the passport, just like it wasn't about the cup. It's about you being the project manager of your home, and his weaponized incompetence.\n\nDon't apologize. He's an adult.

So I change to NTA. But for a long term relationship question is whether he will change or if you are willing to accept this issue. Could be a deal-breaker if he isn't willing to change nor you to accept his shortcoming. \n\n\nOld: YTA. I know it's hard to have someone depend on you, because they are not really capable of managing a task by themselves that is very important and easy for you. (I lost track of how often I have to remind my husband to take his medicine...)\n\nBut you are his partner and you should support each other on your shortcomings. Especially if it is an important event like that. If you want to teach him a lesson do it for something less important. Also, try to give help on how he can remember to take his documents. Eg a calendar entry the night before or a travel checklist. And it might happen that even that won't help.

Another example is someone asks you to do some important work you feel isn't your job & instead of doing the work quickly, you intentionally take an extraordinarily long time and end up making the person late on a deadline.

MONEY. TICKETS, PHONE. You can buy anything else at the other end.", "Yeah, I had undiagnosed ADHD until well into my 40s and I *always* knew it was a me problem. Honestly all the diagnosis did was make me able to disconnect my own sense of worth from my ability to function like a normal adult. It's still a me thing that I need to figure out.", "Where I live, Xanax and Valium don't exist, nor does Benadryl (but there is Allegra), much less the pharmacy section of an American supermarket. Ibuprofen is Actron and paracetamol is Tafirol. And the pharmacy is an independent store and not all of them have card payments. An unwary person who does not know the above would wander around CABA for hours, annoy the supermarket employee asking for a section that does not exist and would confuse the pharmacist trying to ask for brands that do not exist in the country, so it is best to find out what the drug is. the dose, and the presentation (pill, syrup, spray).", "I had a roommate who'd do that every time it was her turn to clean the bathroom.... she'd do it badly and then whine \"I'm so bad at this, you guys should just always take the bathroom\".....  so the other roommate and I voted to put her on bathroom duty until she learned to do it well.... because clearly she needed the practice.  Amazingly that bathroom SHONE the following week.  We had a chore chart and each week we cycled through kitchen, bathroom, and living / dining room cleanup.... each of us taking one common area for a good cleaning.... 3 roommates, 3 common areas.... made sense.", "I find it especially funny since women more often than men tend to be diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, and one of the primary symptom of that is constantly losing things.", "But he was almost insisting she came back with him to pick it up, knowing he may not make it back in time. That\u2019s a \u201cif I can\u2019t have the nice thing, I don\u2019t want you to have it either\u201d. Most people who f***ed up wouldn\u2019t expect their loved ones to bear the consequences of their behaviour.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if it happened accidentally but the BF is a repeat offender.", "Oh, I'm SO saving this one!", "100% agree", "Every time my poor husband had to do something because my female ADHD brain forgets something no one ever says to him \u201cwomen, amirite?\u201d\n\nAnd my distractable self has done some real stupid shit. I am well known for leaving my keys in doors and there\u2019s at least 10 pairs of scissors in the house because I would constantly just leave them in the last place I used them. I even forgot my wallet at home once when I went to the airport! But all that was my brain being itself and it\u2019s my job to learn how to stop doing that or find a work around (eg have 10 pairs of scissors so that every room in the house has its own scissors and I never have to find them)", "Right? When my wife and I go anywhere significant, we spend the week before asking each other constantly if we know for sure where X, Y or Z are. And when we're leaving we're both checking with each other that we've got everything. It's a flipping partnership, you're supposed to cover each others' backs!", "Omg.  I go through this, too, and I\u2019ve never taken them. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nAnd there\u2019s always a millisecond of doubt if I was the only one to pack my bags\u2026", "My thoughts exactly \ud83d\udcaf\n\nHe's trying to manipulate OP.", "She gave him a list that had the passport at the very top, how is she an asshole for assuming he's adult enough to read a list?", "Yeah, incredibly dumb. The most important things for a holiday are your passport, phone, ticket, and wallet. Almost anything else could be replaced at the destination in theory.", "Hanlon\u2019s Razor!", "It wasn't malice until he blamed op for his incompetence. The malice in his reaction calls into question his initial incompetence.", "Sometimes incompetence is so great it's hard to believe it's unintentional."]}
