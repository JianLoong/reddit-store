According to him, all documents have a digital version and that is enough, not all are digital (passport) and not all places accept the digital form, but he is stubborn and maintains this position. I don't mind being responsible for the documents and most of the time, I have them in my purse. \n\nThat is until one day (2 months ago) he called me asking about his identity, because he needed it for something and they didn't accept the digital version, I was at work and I informed him that I had with me. He gave me a huge scolding, saying that their documents should be at home and told me to stop \"holding\" his documents. I handed his documents over to him and said that I would no longer be responsible for this or warn him about it, because I was doing a favor for someone I love who is a capable adult (27). \n\nFor the situation: \n\nWe and our friends decided to travel to another country on New Years from the 12/27-01/03 and a passport is needed as it is on another continent. We would go to the capital where we would stay at our friend's house until our flight time. Our city is 2 hours away.\n\nWe decided to go to the airport 4 hours before (visit the VIP room) and I went to check all my documents first. Paul was on my side and when he saw only one passport, he asked about his and I just said \"You have it\". \n\nHe panicked, saying he thought I had taken even more passports as usual and left it at home. He decided to run home and come back, he asked me to go with him but I didn't want to spend 4 hours in the car. He went to get his passport (but complained that this was something to remember him by) and I went with my friends to the airport.\n\n In short, he didn't arrive on time and I decided I wouldn't miss my trip because of him. I turned off my cell phone and made my 12h trip. \n\nWhen I arrived, several messages from him saying that he couldn't believe that I had gone on a trip without him and that I had done it as forms of revenge because of his scolding. The flights are all booked up or too expensive, so he probably won't come. He's still accusing me of leaving him behind after purposely not remember something I know he struggles with. \n\nMy friends are on my side, but I feel doubtful. \n\nAITA?\n\nI forgot one detail: I always make a list for our trips of what to take, his passport was on the list and he still forgot it", "created_utc": 1672365862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zynue3/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_behind_and_going_on/", "score": 3813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I must say that living your daily life with important documents in your purse is crazy. They can be lost or stolen. His passport should have been at home the whole time.

He should look after his stuff. You should not suffer because hes irresponsible.", "NTA. You have told him multiple times, you have made him a list... Why should you miss on a expensive trip of the life time? Hopefully he won't make the same mistake twice...

It's not about the passport, just like it wasn't about the cup. It's about you being the project manager of your home, and his weaponized incompetence.\n\nDon't apologize. He's an adult.

Are you his girlfriend or his mother? He is an adult. You've already done more than you should for him by making lists and carrying is ID around.

His frustration is understandable but you are not his mother. It's wrong to blame you for his issue.\n\nI am a real flake and forget something really important every time I go somewhere.

In any case - it is his fault, yes,   But it is also the end of your relationship\u2026 one way or the other - so I hope you are ready and wanting that as well", "Edit: to NTA.  just read in another comment from you that you already made him a list with \"passport\" on it. So I change to NTA. But for a long term relationship question is whether he will change or if you are willing to accept this issue. Could be a deal-breaker if he isn't willing to change nor you to accept his shortcoming. \n\n\nOld: YTA. I know it's hard to have someone depend on you, because they are not really capable of managing a task by themselves that is very important and easy for you. (I lost track of how often I have to remind my husband to take his medicine...)\n\nBut you are his partner and you should support each other on your shortcomings. Especially if it is an important event like that. If you want to teach him a lesson do it for something less important. Also, try to give help on how he can remember to take his documents. Eg a calendar entry the night before or a travel checklist. And it might happen that even that won't help.

Your passport is with you\"? Just before you left ft the house.", "NTA. He's 10000% in charge to bring his own belongings and it should have been that way from the get-go.

Forgetting your passport on a 12-hour international flight is no small potatoes!  What else is he so irresponsible about that you can't trust him?  Your household finances?  Your home mortgage?

Weaponized incompetence is when you do something poorly intentionally so you\n\n1. will not be asked to do that thing again,\n2. can have someone do something for you,\n3. can hurt/harm/anger/upset someone,\n4. can punish someone you don't like for a real or perceived act or\n5. can punish someone for asking you to do something in a passive-aggressive, non-confrontational way.\n\nFor example, if your significant other asks you to wash dishes and you really don't want to & want to make sure they stop asking you, you agree to do the dishes, but instead of washing them, you just rinse them. When your SO calls you out, you say \"well this is the way I do them. If you don't like it, then do it yourself\" or \"if you don't like it, then don't ask me\". Another example would be if you're asked to buy decorations for a party when you don't want to be involved in doing that, so you agree, but then intentionally buy the ugliest decorations you can find. Another example is being asked to take care of your child when you don't want to. You agree, but you intentionally don't change the child's diaper. You do a poor job so you won't be ask to watch the kid again. Another example is someone asks you to do some important work you feel isn't your job & instead of doing the work quickly, you intentionally take an extraordinarily long time and end up making the person late on a deadline. The key to weaponized incompetence is the incompetence is intentional and it is done to manipulate.

I'd call that weaponized incompetence. Id hate to be in that car ride... since he seems to be blaming her for forgetting it, probably blame her for everything. If he hadn't blamed her and gotten mad that she went, it would just be pure incompetence. The fact that he expected her to make up for his incompetence and for her to miss out because of it... expected her to stay with him because of it... that's where it becomes weaponized. I wouldn't say it'd fit the strictest definition, but it does fit. And makes it a red flag. \n\nMoreover, she put it on his packing list that she made for him (because he's seemingly incapable of writing his own packing list?) And he still forgot it. I'm assuming she's on AITA because he's trying to make her feel like shit because of his failure. \n\nGenerally weaponized incompetence is more like putting the entire pot of leftovers into the fridge instead of a sealable size appropriate container in order to make the partner do it because \"they're bad at it.\" Which is the classic example. But he is putting the onus on her because he's \"bad at keeping track.\" And therefore she should be responsible for it. That's the weaponized incompetence.

Was I upset? Yes.  Did I blame her? No! I accepted that she'd have to go without me.
