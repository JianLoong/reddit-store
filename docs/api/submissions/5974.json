According to him, all documents have a digital version and that is enough, not all are digital (passport) and not all places accept the digital form, but he is stubborn and maintains this position. I don't mind being responsible for the documents and most of the time, I have them in my purse. \n\nThat is until one day (2 months ago) he called me asking about his identity, because he needed it for something and they didn't accept the digital version, I was at work and I informed him that I had with me. He gave me a huge scolding, saying that their documents should be at home and told me to stop \"holding\" his documents. I handed his documents over to him and said that I would no longer be responsible for this or warn him about it, because I was doing a favor for someone I love who is a capable adult (27). \n\nFor the situation: \n\nWe and our friends decided to travel to another country on New Years from the 12/27-01/03 and a passport is needed as it is on another continent. We would go to the capital where we would stay at our friend's house until our flight time. Our city is 2 hours away.\n\nWe decided to go to the airport 4 hours before (visit the VIP room) and I went to check all my documents first. Paul was on my side and when he saw only one passport, he asked about his and I just said \"You have it\". \n\nHe panicked, saying he thought I had taken even more passports as usual and left it at home. He decided to run home and come back, he asked me to go with him but I didn't want to spend 4 hours in the car. He went to get his passport (but complained that this was something to remember him by) and I went with my friends to the airport.\n\n In short, he didn't arrive on time and I decided I wouldn't miss my trip because of him. I turned off my cell phone and made my 12h trip. \n\nWhen I arrived, several messages from him saying that he couldn't believe that I had gone on a trip without him and that I had done it as forms of revenge because of his scolding. The flights are all booked up or too expensive, so he probably won't come. He's still accusing me of leaving him behind after purposely not remember something I know he struggles with. \n\nMy friends are on my side, but I feel doubtful. \n\nAITA?\n\nI forgot one detail: I always make a list for our trips of what to take, his passport was on the list and he still forgot it", "created_utc": 1672365862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zynue3/aita_for_leaving_my_boyfriend_behind_and_going_on/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why should you miss on a expensive trip of the life time? Hopefully he won't make the same mistake twice...

It's not about the passport, just like it wasn't about the cup. It's about you being the project manager of your home, and his weaponized incompetence.\n\nDon't apologize. He's an adult.

Are you his girlfriend or his mother? He is an adult. You've already done more than you should for him by making lists and carrying is ID around.

Could be a deal-breaker if he isn't willing to change nor you to accept his shortcoming. \n\n\nOld: YTA. I know it's hard to have someone depend on you, because they are not really capable of managing a task by themselves that is very important and easy for you. (I lost track of how often I have to remind my husband to take his medicine...)\n\nBut you are his partner and you should support each other on your shortcomings. Especially if it is an important event like that. If you want to teach him a lesson do it for something less important. Also, try to give help on how he can remember to take his documents. Eg a calendar entry the night before or a travel checklist. And it might happen that even that won't help.
