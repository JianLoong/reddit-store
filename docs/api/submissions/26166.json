Furthermore, I am sure that things won't be easy legally, but at the same time I see them being so defensive as malicious almost putting you in a situation where you have to be the one taking things a step further.\n\nYour husband sounds \"ball-less\": if a mere discussion over this could hinder a marriage it means it's a very weak bond to begin with.\n\nAlso, if your daughter spends so much time with a step-mom that treats her badly where is he when all of this happens?

No accusation just quiet suggestion that this is how your daughter is feeling and maybe this could be explored. \n\nThe fact that your ex is angry when his daughter is miserable tells me everything I need to know about him. He is also deluded if he thinks that his daughter being unhappy when she is with him is not your buisness.

When a step parent enters the picture, it is known that most of the kids have a hard time adjusting. If the new step parent comes with kids as well, the situation becomes even more complicated. \n\nI am not saying that your daughter was lying to you about the situation but there is honestly a possibility that her feelings were a little exagerated due to different factors. Seeing that you have to share your parent's attention with two other kids that are basically strangers to you can mess a little your emmotions. She as a kid does not have the possibility to identify when she is overreacting, therefore her feelings are valid and are not coming with bad intentions. But you as an adult should have this capacity and you should have had more tact when opening the discussion. Instead of directly accusing the new wife of doing this and that, could have asked her and her husband to have a discussion and you could have approached things like \"daughter is telling me this and that, she is feeling like this, do you know whay may have caused it?\".

Parents who allow their partners to mistreat their children unless forced to behave are not good people, and the abuse will often continue in different ways.

Then you see the writing on the wall there because she is not going to change. Your ex should be putting his daughter ahead of her and explaining if you want to be with me , my daughter and I come together as package deal can\u2019t deal with it ? Well that choice is hers.

Be aware of the possible repercussions before acting.", "NTAS and you need to go back to family court and potentially get his visitation re-addressed so she is perhaps with you more because clearly the visiting her Dad isn't working due to Sarah.   \nAt worst it may spook him in to getting serious with Sarah on his shitty treatment of Lily", "NTA - but you are in for an uphill battle. Your daughter needs therapy now. You can try to limit his custody time and you need to start documenting your concerns now. I would even go back and see if you can timeline some of the introduction to the now wife to her behavior escalations. I would also recommend you consult with your family lawyer soon or later. They will be able to lay out your options, likelihood of success, what you need to do, etc based on where you are and how the current judges are ruling.\n\nEveryone is saying protect your daughter and don't let her be exposed to the abuse she sees over there. However, I can not stress this enough - please speak to a lawyer before doing this. Yes, you need to protect your daughter but you want to make sure your actions won't be perceived as alienation or undue parental interference.  I am also seeing people say she is old enough to have a say, but again this is very location dependent. My state won't talk to kids under 12 unless there are concerns of abuse (but again - this is something you will have to prove and could get expensive).\n\nThe biggest factor is your ex. How likely is he to fight you on custody or call the police to enforce the custody order if you don't let your daughter go to his house? Even if she says she doesn't want to go, we were always told by our lawyer to not encourage this and to try to get them to go (because to the courts it looks like you are putting effort into honoring the court order.)\n\nDo what you need to do, but please be smart about it.", "Don't make her go there he's made hid choice and it's not her", "Compose a detailed email to him with what you told Sarah, all the times and events that have upset your daughter, all the times you have talked to ex and his wife and their responses.

He destroyed her home and marriage along with her ex and her kid. She did not know who she was going to hit first, her STBX or his kids. She left him. Went to the cops, he got a charge of child endangerment. She went after him hard. Divorce and civil suits. He screwed himself royally when he attacked her ex physically. The new hubby lost his marriage home and most of his money. His kids were given to his ex. Client and his wife have a little truce. She is undergoing therapy. She managed to ruin numerous lives and is realizing what she had done.", "Time to get evidence ( have daughter keep a diary and you keep a written log of everything she tells you) and get a solicitor. Time to go back to court.", "OP ex has become a shit father who has moved on. Unfortunately that means Lilly  and her well being  isn\u2019t his priority any more. It\u2019s a shame and happens all to often with divorced dads who start over with family number 2 \nI would talk to Lily ask her what she wants. Maybe low contract for everyone is what\u2019s best for now . Or alter the time she spends with her dad to be just her and her dad. So she doesn\u2019t have to deal with wife #2.  I would tell the ex by text or email  how lily feels and about any changes Lilly wants to make to access with her dad. See what his response is and go from there NTA", "There may come a time that you need to go for sole custody if nothing changes at your Ex's.", "Time to go back to court and adjust the visitation schedule", " take him to court for emotional abuse and neglect for your daughter.", "Was coming to comment the same thing. She\u2019s old enough to be listened to now. Simply stop sending her and when he asks explain how his \u2018new family\u2019 is taking priority over his daughter and she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable there anymore", "If anything, OP should remind her ex of this fact. \n\nFix it, or your daughter won't want to come over any more, and neither I or a judge are going to force her to.", "Possibly. Depends on where they are. In my state the kid doesn't have a say until 12 and anytime they do say something it is looked at really closely because they are worried about alienation or parental interference. \n\nWhen my kid (step) was 12 he said he wanted to come live with us. We made him wait a year and make sure he was really sure, because once we put this in motion we couldn't take it back. (We realistically could have, but didn't want to spend a bunch of money on lawyers for him to change his mind.) The judge was very upset with my husband and called him a bad father for putting his kid in this position and making him decide. The problem was this was the only way for us to get custody. Mom wasn't willingly giving up custody, moved around too much to do 50/50, and wasn't abusive/on drugs for us to take him for cause. She finally relented when we waived child support. Still cost us $15k between lawyers and court fees.\n\nSo yes, the child should be listened too but it can be hit or miss depending on the judge and if Dad fights it.  IMO, I would focus on getting her in therapy and working with her therapist to reinforce that none of this is her fault. It sucks she has a crappy father and hopefully OP can help her get through this.", "Please do all you can to protect your daughter. The abuse will have lasting effects.", "This!", "Pitchforks are already out for the stepmom, but OP really does not provide any real details or examples. Is her daughter being made to sit and watch the others eat cake, or is she being told that she can't steal their diaries?\n\nHeck - we don't even know the ages of the other two kids. The stepmom also makes some accusations that seem to be out of nowhere. So explanation there would be helpful.", "Hard disagree with you here. A lot of you comment puts the weight on Lily. She\u2019s a child. She doesn\u2019t have all the self awareness, critical thinking, and other capacities of a emotionally mature adult (yet).  She needs parents to help her. Right now half of her parenting unit has upended and changed everything. That\u2019s emotionally overwhelming. \n\nSo this is where the comment of having more tact is misplaced. She asked to speak privately. That\u2019s a mature and grown up approach. Sarah, getting defensive is not, even though natural reaction, her lack of ability to understand and put priority to kids is a clear indication of immaturity.\n\nThis is why the OP needs to be direct and continue to focus on Lily. There\u2019s nothing more important than prioritizing the emotional well-being of the youth. \n\nIf that hurts adults feelings, well now it\u2019s a great time to learn that adult maturity. Sarah can have totally valid feelings, but the priority of all adults need to be the youth. Period.", "i agree with you.", "how is she jealous ? this comment literally doesn\u2019t make any sense. So is she just supposed to not believe her child and tell her that she\u2019ll come around ?? Her child told her how she felt and like a mother should she addressed it calmly multiple times but nothing seems to be getting done so as a mother i would be upset to if i\u2019m voicing my concerns and nothings is getting done", "She tried ex husband first .

I do hovered remember each of them had us do two rounds of interactions, one in office and one in home, the office one was in 3 situations, me on my own with therapist, me with one \"parent\" and the therapist and then me with the other \"parent\" and therapist. \n\nHopefully I properly trained and qualified therapist can get it right and notice the tension between Stepmum and daughter (and ideally step siblings too).

She asked to speak privately. That\u2019s a mature and grown up approach.* \\- here I will copy & paste OPs words: I calmly expressed my concerns and told her how Lily was feeling left out and hurt. She did not ask the step mom what happened, why is Lily feeling like this, but she expressed her concerns, meaning that she accused the step mom of what Lili told her. \n\nAs I said, it is a very good thing that OP is defending her daughter, but before accusing someone you should at least find out their version of the events. Here is where OP lacked the tact", "Honestly, don\u2019t drag a therapist in this unless you want treatment.
