One day, after dropping Lily off at her dad's place, I asked to speak with Sarah privately. I calmly expressed my concerns and told her how Lily was feeling left out and hurt. I suggested that we could all sit down and discuss how to make this transition easier for Lily.\r  \n\r  \nSarah, however, became defensive and accused me of meddling in her family. She even insinuated that I was trying to drive a wedge between her and my ex-husband. Our conversation quickly escalated into an argument, with neither of us willing to back down.\r  \n\r  \nAfter that confrontation, my ex-husband and I had a heated discussion.

Furthermore, I am sure that things won't be easy legally, but at the same time I see them being so defensive as malicious almost putting you in a situation where you have to be the one taking things a step further.\n\nYour husband sounds \"ball-less\": if a mere discussion over this could hinder a marriage it means it's a very weak bond to begin with.\n\nAlso, if your daughter spends so much time with a step-mom that treats her badly where is he when all of this happens?

No accusation just quiet suggestion that this is how your daughter is feeling and maybe this could be explored. \n\nThe fact that your ex is angry when his daughter is miserable tells me everything I need to know about him. He is also deluded if he thinks that his daughter being unhappy when she is with him is not your buisness.

When a step parent enters the picture, it is known that most of the kids have a hard time adjusting. If the new step parent comes with kids as well, the situation becomes even more complicated. \n\nI am not saying that your daughter was lying to you about the situation but there is honestly a possibility that her feelings were a little exagerated due to different factors. Seeing that you have to share your parent's attention with two other kids that are basically strangers to you can mess a little your emmotions. She as a kid does not have the possibility to identify when she is overreacting, therefore her feelings are valid and are not coming with bad intentions. But you as an adult should have this capacity and you should have had more tact when opening the discussion. Instead of directly accusing the new wife of doing this and that, could have asked her and her husband to have a discussion and you could have approached things like \"daughter is telling me this and that, she is feeling like this, do you know whay may have caused it?\".

Parents who allow their partners to mistreat their children unless forced to behave are not good people, and the abuse will often continue in different ways.

Then you see the writing on the wall there because she is not going to change. Your ex should be putting his daughter ahead of her and explaining if you want to be with me , my daughter and I come together as package deal can\u2019t deal with it ? Well that choice is hers.

Be aware of the possible repercussions before acting.", "NTAS and you need to go back to family court and potentially get his visitation re-addressed so she is perhaps with you more because clearly the visiting her Dad isn't working due to Sarah.   \nAt worst it may spook him in to getting serious with Sarah on his shitty treatment of Lily", "NTA - but you are in for an uphill battle. Your daughter needs therapy now. You can try to limit his custody time and you need to start documenting your concerns now. I would even go back and see if you can timeline some of the introduction to the now wife to her behavior escalations. I would also recommend you consult with your family lawyer soon or later. They will be able to lay out your options, likelihood of success, what you need to do, etc based on where you are and how the current judges are ruling.\n\nEveryone is saying protect your daughter and don't let her be exposed to the abuse she sees over there. However, I can not stress this enough - please speak to a lawyer before doing this. Yes, you need to protect your daughter but you want to make sure your actions won't be perceived as alienation or undue parental interference.  I am also seeing people say she is old enough to have a say, but again this is very location dependent. My state won't talk to kids under 12 unless there are concerns of abuse (but again - this is something you will have to prove and could get expensive).\n\nThe biggest factor is your ex. How likely is he to fight you on custody or call the police to enforce the custody order if you don't let your daughter go to his house? Even if she says she doesn't want to go, we were always told by our lawyer to not encourage this and to try to get them to go (because to the courts it looks like you are putting effort into honoring the court order.)\n\nDo what you need to do, but please be smart about it.", "Don't make her go there he's made hid choice and it's not her", "Compose a detailed email to him with what you told Sarah, all the times and events that have upset your daughter, all the times you have talked to ex and his wife and their responses.

The judge was very upset with my husband and called him a bad father for putting his kid in this position and making him decide. The problem was this was the only way for us to get custody. Mom wasn't willingly giving up custody, moved around too much to do 50/50, and wasn't abusive/on drugs for us to take him for cause. She finally relented when we waived child support.

They were together, things were fine they got married boom problem. Which, some people can hide who they are and this may be the case, but for some reason im veering more toward  the child being upset and confused, ect & maybe taking things too personal &/or exaggerating. My sons father and I have been split for 6 years. We\u2019ve gotten along well. He has three other children from different women. Always been a good dad. I got married in Feb. he got in another relationship last June. At first, things were great. Then my child started coming home from his dads saying stuff like \u201cdaddy and his GF only take the other kids to do stuff and I can\u2019t.\u201d He felt left out, he was even going as far as saying his GF was mean to him. Which had never been an issue prior. She was always nice and he came home talking about her like she hung the moon. Eventually it got so bad with his accusations and the accusations for more physical. I ended up taking his father back to court. He was shocked . Upset. Defensive because he was fighting for his child. I on the other hand thought I was just protecting my child. I won custody. But I continued to let him see his son supervised through the court because I didn\u2019t want to take him away from him I just wanted him to realize if this woman was doing this, I wouldn\u2019t allow it and he needed to open his eyes. He didn\u2019t back down. Neither did she. I got called names, ext. but I was just protecting my child, right? No. Wrong. Eventually his accusations started about my husband . The same exact things, same wording, the difference is. He is never alone with my husband. We both work the same times so I take him and pick him up from school and my husband comes home in time for dinner. My son eats. Showers. Plays a game with us. And goes to bed . So I was confused . We eventually got my child into therapy because the accusations were getting out of hand toward everyone who wasn\u2019t me or his dad. He stayed in therapy for awhile and he came clean to his therapist . It was made up. He felt me and his dad were going to forget him due to other children now being around 24/7. He didn\u2019t have all or most the attention. He was younger and couldn\u2019t do the things the older kids could. Daddy\u2019s attention was on his GF sometimes and mine was on my husbands sometimes. He noticed . It was jealousy and he didn\u2019t know how to handle it so he acted out. He has since gotten better. His father & I are back to our normal half and half coparenting , we still get along . But we\u2019ve switched our days with him around so each of us has a one on one day with just our son a week . Things have been better. I was the AH for going so far to do what I thought was protecting my child. His father understood after talking to the therapist and her explaining some of what he was saying even at the beginning of therapy and how there were valid concerns. Now we know to talk and trust eachother more. Communication is key. Maybe she feels left out because she can\u2019t do what the other children are doing. Maybe she hasn\u2019t mentioned to her dad or his wife about her kids bullying her because she feels comfortable telling you and not them as she feels she won\u2019t be believed (as children we sometimes think this way even if not given a reason) so maybe you telling the father was a shock. He mentioned it and they both talked and decided they haven\u2019t heard any complaints from her and maybe to just watch closer and let it go unless it comes up again. Then you go there, confront her and she feels attacked. To her, it\u2019s out of the blue . She has no clue where this is coming from. She\u2019s hurt so she\u2019s defensive. While I hope your child isn\u2019t being treated differently, my view and experience in this situation could be completely wrong and you could be NTA. But communication goes a long way. Confrontation does nothing but add gas to the fire . Healthy communication . Maybe with your daughter there so it stays civil and everyone can hear her side and be on the same page would be a great start. Maybe if they see it isn\u2019t you just making things up and it\u2019s valid concerns they will understand why you are upset . Right now they feel as though it\u2019s a jealousy technique from you, because let\u2019s be honest. As much as we try, sometimes us mothers can be a bit much or come on too strong when it comes to our children\u2019s fathers .

I got out of my car and walking up to the house I saw, in the window she was right in my 13 year old son's face, yelling at him. So loud I heard it from the street. I walked right in, without knocking, and got in her face. I told her if I ever hear of her talking to my kids like this again she will have me to deal with. I told her if my kids do something she doesn't approve of she is tell their father or me and we would handle it, not her because she obviously doesn't know how to deal with kids. Their dad was at the store apparently. I waited for him to come back and told him what I walked in on and told him he better handle it or the kids won't be coming to visit if she is here. I can't stand these \"step parents\" who won't except the children of their spouse. I bent over backwards to make my stepson feel included and loved and part of my side of the family and all without making my own kids feel left out. Like what is wrong with people.

He may be a great dad. She makes it sound like he\u2019s not doing anything about the situation. OP said she talked to dad he said he\u2019d talk to the wife . Then she went ahead and confronted wife instead . In that case she\u2019s not even giving the man a chance to talk to her or talk to the daughter to figure it out. If the daughter has never told her father what is happening &/or his wife what is happening how is he supposed to know what\u2019s really going on without talking to all parties?
