She has a daughter from a previous marriage who is 19/f with level 1 autism (can talk but is about 8 years old mentally and can not pick up on social situations). We also have a 10/f that does not have autism. The 19 year old (Sara not her real name) always wants to wear provocative clothing every time we go out as a family to a restaurant. This could be Denny\u2019s on a Sunday morning or a nicer restaurant on Friday night. She insists to be able to wear tight low cut, skirts or something that shows off her body. I feel like she can wear this if she were to go out with her friends but with autism, she doesn\u2019t have any friends. Because she goes out with the family and our 10 year old, I don\u2019t think it is appropriate. Make friends and wear those clothes with them, but not these \u201cclubbing clothes\u201d with us. My wife sides with Sara and says that I am over-reacting. I don\u2019t like it because the 10 year wants to sit next to my wife and I have to sit next to the 19 year old. Also, as a dad, I see the types of looks she gets from other men because of what she wears and the evening is not great for me. I don\u2019t feel that my feelings are respected. I am the one paying for the meal and we always have a fight about what she wears. It is like she is going to prom or a club in Miami.

Your feelings have no part of that, how other men look at her has no part in that, your obvious embarassment of her has no part in that, her autism has no part in that. Phrases like you \"have\" to sit with her and justifications like you paying for the meal come off as immature and controlling.\n\nIt seems you are uncomfortable with her \"showing off her body\" but it's possible she's just wearing clothes she thinks are cute or comfy. Even if she is \"showing off her body\"  -- it's hers! We all have a body, we all look a certain way, letting people see that we have a body is not the end of the world! \n\nAn exception might be something like the ballet or a play in a nice theater, which often mention dress code expectations anyway.

You sound extremely condescending and ignorant. I don\u2019t see how her autism has anything to do with how she dresses. If your wife is okay with it let it go. You want your stepdaughter to change something about herself just bc it makes you uncomfortable and that\u2019s not right.

Never around my mom or my friends that were girls.  I didn't understand what the comments meant until I was older.  The 19yr old has been in your life since she was little.  \n\nYour younger daughter is getting to an age, where she will be dating soon, eventually the 19 year old could be going out with the 10 year olds friends (when she is older). Start teaching them both how they should be treated by their friends when they go out.  Keep them from being prey to those with undesirable intentions.  \n\nIt needs to be a family decision, talk it over with your wife.  Maybe have a dance party at your house you and your wife demonstrate.  It can be fun", "YTA- ok, goofy.", "NTA, \n\nBut sir, is this really, REALLY, a hill you want to die on.", "NTA you are just being a dad.

Why not go the full zealot and have her wear only clothes you deem appropriate for you know \u2018religious reasons\u2019 or some BS. Honestly the problem here is you, you don\u2019t get to dictate what others can and cannot do, especially other adults. You say she\u2019s mentally about 8 is that just your opinion as you say she\u2019s \u2018level 1\u2019 but on the scale that\u2019s the mildest form so that doesn\u2019t tie up with your 8 y/o mental development.", "YTA - She could be wearing a nun habit and a man might still r@pe her.

She's mentally 8, with how her autism is. The world is a shitty place and pervs are everywhere, not to mention a nice family dinner isn't the place to be wearing very showy or flashy clothes. Especially with someone like her who can be very easily manipulated. And well it's also rude, as someone who dresses in showy clothing I can at least respect and know the time and place for those things. I can also know when I'm being manipulated which if you know anything about people with autism they usually don't know, she specifically can't read the room either which is a terrible sign.

I wear revealing clothes but there's a time and place for that, a nice family dinner is not a place for that. And like you said if you have a mental handicap or something like autism youre going to be an easy target for manipulation. I can't tell you how many people ik with autism who have been walked on, used, manipulated, etc (in different ways).

I hope that there\u2019s a language difference but doubt it.", "Except that's not true at all, because he specifically said he wouldn't care if she made friends and went out clubbing in those clothes. Which has a much higher risk of danger than going to brunch with her family. So this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting her.", "Bless your heart.", "Bs", "Nah, this is pure ignorance. If he knew what he was talking about, he wouldn\u2019t be here asking if policing his adult step daughter\u2019s clothing choices was something he was truly entitled to or not.", "I addressed both issues, he also stated \"I see the types of looks she gets from men\". I addressed the part where there's a time and place for showy clothes as well. He's not only protecting her but he's mentioning manners as well. Both sides bother him. Also you can't have your parents around your whole life so having a bunch of close friends around when you go out is about as safe as you can get, aside from not going out at all. I'm sure he'd rather her go out with her friends than go out alone.", "I don't know if that's sarcasm or not but thank you regardless."]}
