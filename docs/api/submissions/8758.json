In my university the CE program has a bunch of pre-req classes that everyone has to take so we know most of our batch mates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: There are very few women in the program and most students men. One of these women, Lisa is very girly in the way she dresses, like coming to campus dressed like a model, wearing heels. bright pink etc. I did a group project once with her and we became good friends and ended up leasing an apartment together. She is really smart, has a perfect GPA and is good in computer networking and some aspects of computer graphics. I have good skills in networking as well due to some side projects I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not get along with some of the other men as when I hang out with them they get quite rowdy and say racist and sexist things that make me uncomfortable. They make fun of my friend and how she dresses behind her back a lot before they knew I was friends with her. Eventually since she was friends with most of the other women in our program, I ended up with a friend group that is mostly women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a hackathon recently and I joined after an acquaintance reached out to me. Some team members were one of these rowdy people I disliked but I agreed anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day preceding the hackathon we discussed recruiting one more team member and I mentioned having a friend who is really good and whose abilities would be useful. I kept using the pronoun \"They\" and not she. I asked my friend and she was excited to join and spent the day practicing some things related to graphics shaders which could come in handy. I did not add her to the fb group chat and just had her show up to the event to sign up there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got her to meet the team, the self appointed team lead, was like Oh we decided we just want to be a team of 4, since it would be too hard to coordinate 5 people. My friend was visibly upset but said she doesn't mind leaving since she did not feel like being in a team alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI felt shitty and said I could form a team of 2 with her instead. The others had a surprised Pikachu face when I said that, and asked me if I'm sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey needed networking skills for their initial idea and had to come up with a new one. We ended up doing something requiring the same skills as their original idea but that was definitely a different idea. However we might not have come up with that if I had not known their idea first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end their project was incomplete and we ended up winning first place. 2 of the team members were very mad at me and called me an AH, told me some nasty things about me being a \"simp\", white knight and saying we only won because of her \"pussy pass\" and that I probably did all the work. They said it was misleading of me to not say who the friend was and use the pronoun they instead of she when they knew the person. They claimed it was not about her being a woman just that she sucked.", "created_utc": 1675136675, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pncan/aita_for_leaving_misleading_my_coding_competition/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Despite all your excellent intentions, you put her in a situation where she was a 'gotcha' to the team, and she didn't ask for that or agree to that. \n\nYou knew you were hiding her gender from the team, and you should have asked her if she wanted to be involved with that.\n\nYour intentions are great, but be careful you don't patronise someone or put them in a difficult situation because you've decided to 'help' them without their knowledge.", "NTA\n\nTHEY were the AHs. And their using sexist language certainly suggests they didn\u2019t want her on the team because of who she is.  If her gender didn\u2019t matter, then why does it matter that you used They instead of She?", "NTA\n\n>They claimed it was not about her being a woman just that she sucked\n\nBut she got first place on a team of just 2 and they couldn't complete their project. So who sucks?", "NTA. Regardless of what the rest of the group claimed it seems like they either a) don\u2019t respect her as a comp engineer because she\u2019s a woman or b) just don\u2019t like her personally. In either case it\u2019s super rude to publicly boot someone off a team project. Good for you for taking up with her; obviously she doesn\u2019t suck since you guys won.", "NTA\n\n> 2 of the team members were very mad at me and called me an AH, told me some nasty things about me being a \"simp\", white knight and saying we only won because of her \"pussy pass\" and that I probably did all the work. \n\nThese two team members are the only people being assholes in this story.", "As a woman in tech I\u2019m a bit torn on my judgement here. You\u2019re obviously not the asshole in regards to your male teammates. They are going to have a rude awakening when they try to apply for corporate jobs/internships. I do not envy their future bosses who will have to spend the effort to rid them of these toxic opinions.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, you treated your roommate pretty shabbily and she did nothing to deserve it. You set her up to be publicly rejected and facing the antagonistic sexism of a group that she thought *she\u2019d been invited to join.* She handled it gracefully, allowing you to swoop in and okay the White Knight who rejects the dastardly former teammates to run off with the fair maiden - which more and more feels like it was your plan. You used your \u201cfriend\u201d like a prop in a play and frankly that\u2019s not the kind of ally that any of us needs.\n\n\n\nFinal Judgement: **ESH** except the young woman that you all treated like an NPC instead of a person.", "NTA at all, and good for you! It's impressive that you decided to go after someone who was highly qualified and you stood up for her (and your beliefs too). Honestly, those people are shameful and I'm glad they lost. You will go much further in your career without being a harassment/discriminatory liability to future employers", "So much drama in the CE program.\n\nYou're a bit devious.\n\nNTA", "NTA and way good on you for beating those stupid sexists.", "Look, NTA, but you NEED to stand up for the women in your life. Stop using \"they\" when you mean \"she\" (although it's a fantastic habit to use \"they\" before you know someone's pronouns, and obviously when that is their pronoun), and stop tolerating sexist behaviour around you. Obviously you have to pick your battles and can't fight every single comment in every single situation, but don't just sit there and let people speak that way about women. Same with the racism. Often, people won't listen to the marginalised group they're being awful to, they'll only listen to people like them. It's shitty and gross, but we need allies like you to help us.", "Not about her being s woman but you should have used the pronoun indicating her gender.  \n\nDid you console them and suggest that team of five may have brought them the prize.", "Nah they're the assholes for offering your friend a spot and taking it away last second. Youre the good guy here id say. You stood by your friend even though it put you at a disadvantage. And congrats on winning. If their sexism convinces them to throw away talent then fuck em", "NTA. Well done for being an ally against nasty misogynists. Look what can happen when you\u2019re not AHs.", "Post is fake imo, another underdog story...", "I am brand new to this so please know that if I f up. \n\nUltimately it sounds to me like they are jealous. I would have done what you did in the same situation.", "Oh, interesting one. I feel like ESH. You for not saying who you' were going to invite despite knowing that the dudes do not like your friend. The rest of the team, because they should make sure in advance that you bring a person they tolerate.\n\nNot once and not twice have I agreed to join teams while not knowing who all the members are. The worst situation ended up with me being in a uni comp team with my very emotional ex and that destroyed the day for the whole team, not only the two of us. So, lessons learned, before joining a group all members must be known to everyone so someone can make their objections, justified or not.\nAfter all, these teams are made based on friendship, not some official assessment of skill.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Despite a good reason for the lie definitely makes you come off as a dishonest asshole", "ESH. \n\nThey suck 98%. For very obvious reasons that you seem completely aware of. \n\nBut you suck a little bit too. You knew what their reaction to a female addition would be. Which is why you very consciously used \"they\" instead of she. You may not have known exactly what would happen, but you knew they wouldn't like it and that they are ridiculously sexist. It's a crappy situation to put your roommate into. \n\nCongrats on winning! I'm glad you two ended up winning. Now you know a team of you two can be incredibly strong! :) \n\nBased on your replies to comments similar to this one. I'm pretty sure you've already figured out what you did wrong and won't do it again. Which is awesome and such a nice thing to see on reddit!", "The idea that these young men will end up working in the tech industry sends shivers through me. I've worked in the high tech industry as a female software engineer since the 90s. AHs like them is the reason female engineers are continuing to face discriminatory working conditions.

They deserved to lose.\n\nAnd if you want to throw some petty in there, I wonder if your department heads would be interested in knowing how your classmates treat women, or what they think about the judging of the competition.", "YTA - The other teammates knew your friend, and it seems like there was bad chemistry there, or at the very least, a lack of respect. Instead of saying, \"I would like to invite X\", you were intentionally vague as to who you were inviting. I am not sure whether you were vague out of habit or because you thought that your group would reject your friend. Regardless, by springing it on them at the last second and when your friend was present, you made it more awkward and likely to result in interpersonal conflict than necessary, prevented your team from finding a new network programmer, and prevented you and your friend from forming a decent sized team.\n\nOn a side note, regardless of the situation, leaving a team member out of the FB chat was a really bad idea. Even if everything was fine, doing that ensured that she would not be part of the planning, and, particularly given your overlapping skill set, ensured that she would be seen as your assistant, rather than a full blown member of the team.\n\nYour team may very well also be the AH. However, your decision to be vague, keep the line of communication closed, and then spring your friend on them unnecessarily magnified the problem.", "NTA and thank you for being a good guy.  \n\nYour friends/whatever you want to call them are the ones who would simp for girls, etc. They are projecting how *they* would treat her onto you.", "That is true. Honestly I did not really do it intentionally to spite them. I have a habit of saying they when referring to women when talking to men especially in the context of school maybe because I am a bit self conscious about being judged for being in their friend group.", "I brought that up with them and they claimed something like, if I used she, they would assume it were her as we sit together in class and there are not many other women.\n\nI do not know for sure if they would have disliked another woman, my friend gets made fun of and outcast more because she likes to dress up and they find that amusing. She does stand out and look out of place compared to the others but she is a cool and nerdy person like everyone else.", "We did good and our project looked polished since she has great skills and did some work with graphics and lighting but I would say that these competitions are judged subjectively and it depends on being lucky as there were other good projects.", "I think you have a point. It was not intentional as honestly I did not know these people  well enough to really know that they disliked her that much, I know they associated with some other people who said mean things about her but I thought only one of them sucked personality wise (but I underestimated the extent of it). I did apologize to her for the situation.\n\nI have a habit of using they when talking passively, usually to protect people from being identified.  I think where I do suck, is that sometimes when talking to men I feel awkward giving away that the friends I am talking about are women and I automatically use they to hide that.\n\nI definitely am not patronizing towards her or treat her any differently than a guy friend when we interact with each other, and I like that we have similar interests and we are both more experienced beyond what is taught in school.", "I have a habit of referring to women as they when talking about them to men in particular. Sometimes even when talking about men. I honestly did not think it was such a big deal and thought they wouldn't mind. They did not ask me who it was and it just did not come up. I did not do it intentionally.\n\nI did start having second thoughts later when I was about to add her to the group chat but did not. I also figured out the hackathon discord would have a chat the next day anyway.\n\nMy friend knew who the teammates were.", "Fair enough, but you said you also know they make fun of her, and yet you did not mention to them who she was and did not add her to the chat. It really does sound like you were trying to stealth it.\n\nI'm saying, intention or no intention, be mindful of putting her in A Situation.", "Popping in to say that the teammates are AHs, but what you did isn't completely ok either. Your friend had to show up and be kicked out, just because you agreed to be on a team with jerks. Ok, so the two of you were able to form a team and win, but what if that wasn't possible? She would've felt awful and it would have been entirely your fault. It's good that you support your friend, but you shouldn't do it by hiding her till the last possible minute. That you didn't add her to the group chat shows that you knew on some level that the others wouldn't allow it.\n\nFor that, I say ESH. I get what you were going for, but the right way would have been to be open about it, and convincing the others of her skills. They might not have agreed, in which case, you could have quit and formed a team with her anyway, **without** her having to be told she was unwanted.", "I understand, but by using \"they\" like this you are unintentionally erasing the women that are in your program.  Perhaps if your stupid friend group heard \"she/her\" more often, they wouldn't be so...stupid.", "She subjectively didn\u2019t suck then. If your original team hadn\u2019t sucked by booting her they could\u2019ve won too.", "I appreciate the follow up and retract the comments where I assumed your intention. There\u2019s nothing wrong with using neutral pronouns and those other guys are assholes. In the future, try to give a girl a heads up about what she might be walking into. It gives them the agency to decide how she wants to handle it ahead of time.", "Yeah I should have been mindful about that. I did not like these people but I did not really remember them specifically not liking her however they were friends with other people that made fun of how she dresses and some rude jokes that implies she thinks dressing like she does will make profs and TAs favor her.\n\nI did not see it as a big deal as they asked me if I knew anyone who was good."]}
