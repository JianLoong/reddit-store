It would annoy me too.\n\nI don't know which country you live in, but if your friend ever unblocks you and talks to you again, tell her to watch a TV show called Little Britain.\n\nThere's a character in it called Daffyd Thomas (played by Matt Lucas, who is gay). Daffyd believes he is \"the only gay in the village\", and sees persecution and lack of acceptance wherever he goes. In fact, everyone in the village is either gay themselves, or totally accepting and warm towards gay people. Every time Daffyd doesn't get something he wants (e.g. when he wasn't cast in the role of Hamlet), he claims it's due to the village's homophobia. Whenever he meets someone else who is gay, he is instantly hostile towards them.\n\nDaffyd behaves the way he does because he **wants** to be the only gay in the village.

I feel for the parents - how were they to know that just being accepting wasn't enough and it is a gift giving occasion these days?!", "NTA, tell her to get off social media and realize her parents accepted her. This isn't some movie or TV show. This is real life, and she's not the star.", "NTA.\n\nImagine being so privileged that you're upset that your parents were too supportive of you coming out.

That\u2019s the point no? It should be normal to be yourself?", "NTA, I am a straight female so my take might be wrong. But shouldn't that be the ideal response to a 'coming out' conversation? \n\nI am sure many people would love that response from their parents.\n\nIt seems to me they wanted attention from their parents and didnt like the response they gave but this surely was the ideal response for most people?", "Man, if it's one thing I can't stand it's people seeking more validation than they deserve.

It may now take her awhile to understand what you meant.", "NTA. Her parents responded exactly like they should, gave her a hug and made no fuss. \n\nBecause there should be no fuss or grumble about sexuality at all.

And as much as it hurts in that moment (no \"I live you no matter what\", \"I'm happy if you are happy\"...), compared to all the other coming outs I have witnessed over the years, it was one of the best I could get.\nAnd I know my mom loves me, no matter what, she never failed to tell and show me over the years! I think she was just a little shocked at this moment, I told her out of nowhere in a normal conversation.\n\n\nWhy is she expecting presents and stuff? I don't get it tbh. Other people get ass kicks and not the good ones, she should be grateful. I don't know anyone who got presents or parties after a coming out and I know lots of queer people...

If she'd come out as gay instead would you have put that in quotes too?\n\n\nBisexual erasure is a real thing that bi people deal with from both sides (the LGBT+ and straight communities).  People automatically assume that bi women are really straight and bi men are really gay.  Please don't contribute to that by giving the impression that you don't believe someone is really bisexual when they say they are.\n\nThat said, your friend is also TA (hence my verdict) for wanting more drama instead of being happy her parents accepted her coming out.", "NTA.\n\nYou told her to STFU: that *was* the reaction!

The whole purpose of LGBT+ rights and attitudes, is to treat people within the community with the equality that we treat heterosexual people... nobody bats an eyelid if someone comes out as straight (nobody comes out as straight anyway) so hardly reacting, accepting and carrying on with life is the best way to accept LGBT+ coming out moments.\n\nYour friend's words are ridiculous and she is clearly attention seeking, seeing that the reaction element (positive or negative) was more important than the familial honesty. This is a stupid priority. Given how many kids are disowned by parents for being LGBT+, your friend's words are actually disgusting and she needs to grow up.", "ESH. It\u2019s the putting bisexual in quotes that did it for me. Not sure why that was necessary and makes me question whether you\u2019ve actually been supportive. Of course I recognize that you wrote this after the falling out happened so I might be sensing some angry undertones but either way, the \u201cbisexual\u201d has asshole energy.\n\nETA: and obviously your friend sucks too but it also sounds like she just wants validation of her identity. Being a teenager was hard and I sort of get wanting to feel celebrated (regardless of whether you just came out or just had some other kind of success). That, however, can be insufferable as a friend or bystander.", "Ooof. NTA, but a soft one -- because maybe I'm reading a lot into this, but given her reaction I'm guessing her parents not caring about things is a common theme in her life, and I'm tempted to say N A H out of sympathy for her if that's the case. But I know I'm guessing, and I think she needed some sort of reality check in the moment, hence my judgement. \n\nHopefully she'll calm down and maybe get over herself a little bit. If so, and you get the chance, maybe suggest she talk to a counselor or some sort of professional about her need for attention. But until then, I think just give her some space.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she came out specifically to get a special prize, not because she wanted to share her truth.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s a narcissistic asswipe, don\u2019t cry about her loss. \n\nI also understand the reaction you had and why you had it. You\u2019re also 17, so I don\u2019t expect perfect interpersonal communication. \n\nBut that was a serious asshole moment from you. A more reasonable reaction would have been to either try to help her see that using a calmer tone, or to just realize she\u2019s a narcissistic asswipe and quietly cut down on communication. So you get the asshole tag here too, but I think you know that and can learn from it.", "Being bi IS difficult too. It's an AH move to dismiss her experience. I'm not talking about the parents' reaction necessarily.\nAs a bi woman, there are many issues, the main one being nobody takes it seriously, most family/friends thinks it's a phase that will go away, or totally deny its existence. In my experience most of my gay/lesbian friends also rejected my sexuality, the straights think you're greedy and undecisive. When you're with a partner of one gender people stop seeing you as bi etc. \nHer reaction is over the top but just remember this, if you're going to remain friends :)", "NTA, the best reaction to someone coming out is acting as usual because it shows nothing has changed. If she's upset that they didn't make a big deal out of it, she didn't care about coming out to them or that they accept her she just wanted attention. Also, as opposed to what you write, they DO fully accept her, their reaction is accepting of her sexuality, it just isn't a big deal.", "NTA she needs to get off tiktok \ud83e\udd23", "Nta she sounds like a drama queen who wants people to make a big fuss over her", "So NTA. Your friend is hilarious and needs to grow up.", "NTA your friend is an attention seeking teenager and hopefully will eventually grow up", "NTA. Sounds like your \"friend\" might be though.\n\nI'm taking the loss of friends you mentioned as something painful that I won't mention the term for just in case, and if so I can completely understand your reaction.\n\nI know that bi erasure is a thing, but this certainly doesn't sound like that. And I know that some parents are just emotionless, and it doesn't sound like that either. It sounds like she's just wanting to be the centre of attention, and in the context of other friends you've lost, she should be more understanding and if she's blocking you, doesn't sound like a friend to me.", "NTA.\n\nHer parents are good parents (at least with this), she just wants drama so she has a look at me story to tell people or to have a hallmark moment. I'd trade her if I could, parents that stop seeing you as their child for being you is a weird kind of awful. Let her go be friends with people that'll reinforce her desire for drama, away from you.", "I feel like I see both sides of this, so I\u2019m gonna say no assholes here personally. I totally understand why you got angry that she was complaining over the lack of response, because it *could* be so much worse. But at the same time, it can feel so underwhelming to work yourself up to telling someone something that\u2019s so important, and then they don\u2019t have much of a response at all, and you just sort of feel like, hollow? I\u2019ve had both experiences, and they both feel shitty in their own ways. I feel like this is one of those things where comparing only ends up invalidating one experience or the other.", "NTA- Your friend isn't really bi. She just wants attention. That's my take.", "nta. i will get a lot of hate for that shit but a good part of the lgbt community is just attention seeking ... the same thing happens when teenagers start smoking.", "I know this sounds terrible but as a young queer woman, I would bet she is probably not gay and mostly wanted attention. \n\nComing out is terrifying, I know you know because of your other friend. The phrase \u201cat least then I would have gotten a reaction\u201d makes it clear that her biggest goal was to get a reaction. \n\nI don\u2019t know your friend, but I would also guess that her parents don\u2019t pay attention to her. Like enough to make her feel like they don\u2019t care about her. \n\nAnyways NTA, but I hope your friend (and the other friend) are okay", "It might not feel like it, but this is a classic case of mind reader syndrome. She expects a certain reaction from someone, and when she didn't get it, upset they didn't read her mind, she gets upset. What she should have done, is tell her parents, politely, how she feel and what she wants from them. What kind of reaction, a celebration, she wants to feel validated. \n\nYou get small ah score for just bursting out on here instead of being Any kind of support or advice (including Though love, which she need to hear so she can understand how misguided and lucky she really is.)\n\nESH.", "This could have been a good learning opportunity for her about other peoples' experiences, to gain a bit of insight/ perspective. But people rarely engage after being told to STFU. I wouldn't say YTA because of that, but expecting a different reaction from her seems ill-judged at best.", "YTA\n\nComparing these things isn't fair. Coming out is still a very big thing. She had obviously built it up in her head and is struggling with the low-key response. You're not really being fair to dismiss her venting with 'you don't know how lucky you have it'.\n\nShe does know. Coming out takes so much courage precisely because it can go so badly. There is an increasing move to normalise sexuality - which is awesome - but a surprising result is that it can feel like the courage it took to come out is sometimes devalued by people asserting that they don't care about the sexuality, or the courage behind the act of coming out. And when you take such a big step and make yourself so vulnerable, only to be told it doesn't matter, that hurts.\n\nSaying that that is meaningless because she could have been severely mistreated was unkind. Do you constantly compare everything anyone does to the worst case scenario? Does someone who says they're hungry get reminded that some people are starving so shut up? I hope not.\n\nYou're both still very young. I can forgive most of her comments simply because at 16, its very common to think of yourself first. Your brains are still developing. Were her comments a bit self-absorbed? Maybe. But your response was also unnecessary and insensitive. You do owe her an apology, if she's open to it. She might not be. Hopefully you both learn and grow from this either way.", "Of course YTA for saying that. She has better situation so you can be rude to her? She's looking for attention so you can be rude to her? You could just simply talk to her about others people's situation or at least just tell her to get over herself but you've chosen the worst way. That's why YTA.\n\nOthers peoples mistakes or way of thinking that we don't agree with don't give us excuse to be rude.", "Both of you are AH.  Keep clear of each other.

And I am really happy they don't make a big deal out of it. To them it's just another aspect of my personality, which as long as it doesn't directly affect them or me negatively is not an issue.\n\nI hate it when people make a giant deal out of their sexuality or gender.

She would lie to her classmates about her family members being celebrities and other lies that kids much younger than her try to get away with, but her friends knew she was lying. \n\nOne day she told me she was gay and that she is in a relationship with a girl she never met but plays an online game with, and they use in-game chat. First I warned her about the fact that many people lie and use fake accounts on internet and that she shouldn't share personal information or invest her feelings in something like that. I only felt the need to tell her this because she was quite naive and immature for her age. She rolled her eyes and told me that I just hate her for being gay. I laughed and told her that I don't hate her (she knows it, we had these lessons/therapy talks for years, she was just testing me out to see the reaction) and I said that being gay is totally ok and that no one should care about who she likes except herself. I went on to talk about my gay friends and how their sexual orientation doesn't bother me at all and that neither myself, or anybody else has the right to be bothered by the life choices of others. \nThe moment she realised I was ok with gay, she started making homophobic comments about herself, like she was \"dirty\" and \"sinful\". I was worried because her family was a bit \"old school\" and thought she heard that from them, but it turned out she was just trying to provoke me to agree with that to get attention. She went on to make her instagram a shrine of gayness for a couple of months  as she started highschool. I got a full time job and stopped giving her lessons around that time, but I kept track of her and her academic achievements, and I am happy to say that she grew out of attention seeking and shouting \"I'm gay\" everytime someone spoke to her.

That, in all likelihood, is rather biphobic.\n\nIn Scenario B, Friend 2 accepts Friend 1's sexuality and continues treating them as they always have before. Friend 1 then freaks out that they don't care about them. Friend 2 naturally wonders: \"most queer people just want to be accepted and treated the same as everyone else; so is my friend really bi, or are they just looking for a strong reaction out of me?\"\n\nNow, sure, I'm straight, so I you could rightly point out to the fact that I don't know anything about coming out as bi.

Their family and friends do not take it seriously. Often women are told that they're faking it, doing it for attention, or doing it to be more desirable to men. Most of my male friends who are bisexual have terrible experiences trying to date women because women cannot get past the fact that they have slept with men and doubt that they are actually attracted to women.\n\nWho gets to determine whether someone is \"faking it\" or whether they are exploring their sexuality because they just aren't sure who they're attracted to yet? Homosexuality was classified as a sociopathic personality disturbance in the DSM until 1968 and then a personality disorder until 1980 when it was renamed \"ego dystonic homosexuality.\" [It wasn't until 2013 that the DSM finally got rid of mental disorders based on sexual orientation.](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp-rj.2022.180103) \n\nSo when people assume that someone who is acting erratically and trying to get attention generally who then comes out as bisexual is specifically doing that for attention, it perpetuates the stigma against the LGBT+. She might also be acting bizarrely because coming out is a really big deal.\n\nI understand there are instances of women assuming the bisexual label in a fetishizing and objectifying way and I'm sure there are people who knowingly lie and say they're bisexual because they want attention, it is really harmful to question people when they tell you their sexuality. If someone is really nervous about coming out and someone makes them feel like they don't believe them that's devastating. I just want people to choose to view situations like this in a way that really shows empathy for the person and tries to make them feel accepted rather than invalidated.", "Here's why that might not be ideal. Of course your mileage may vary on this because all people are different.\n\nWhen you are discovering your sexuality, there's a time where you try to hide it. Because it's weird and different and you look around and observe than anyone who doesn't conform to heteronormativity is made fun of and excluded. To give you a hint of what it can be, one time in the sixth grade before I had any hint of my own sexuality I zoned out while sitting in the cafeteria and I guess I was just staring into space. I \"came to\" when I realized a girl who was more popular than me had sat down in my eye line and thought I was staring at her. She got angry and told everyone I was a lesbian. At the time I knew that wasn't true but did it stop my peers from absolutely destroying me? It didn't.\n\nSo you build up and build up and build up this terrifying thing in your head. When you go to tell someone you care about once you've done an enormous amount of internal work, it can very much feel like they don't care or they don't believe you. And when they say they already knew it's horrible because you've tried so hard to keep it under wraps for your own safety.", "Yup!\n\nBut at the same time, like I said, no one wants to feel invalidated. We do want to feel normalised but a quick \"Thank you for trusting me with this info, I'm happy for you.\" Even if insencere can be a thousand times better than a \"ok and?\ud83d\ude12\". It's also largely about tone.\n\nYour reaction is very sweet and exactly how I wish mine went.

You feel exposed in the worst way possible.\n\nWe aren't asking for parties or anything, all we ask is that you show your acknowledgment with a quick \"thanks for telling me and trusting me with this\". That little sentence would show me that you listened, and didn't just respond on autopilot.\n\nAlso, because of said carefulness, once young gays \"baby gays\" come out, they tend to finally feel safe and start expressing themselves in ways they couldn't.

When you spend that long psyching yourself up for something that feels like a *huge* risk, a non-reaction can absolutely feel like a letdown - you still have all these big emotions, but now there\u2019s nowhere for them to go. There was no cathartic moment, no big fight, no tearful embrace. And a 16 year old is going to have no idea how to handle that. \n\nAll this girl did was vent those messy feelings to a friend. She\u2019s committed no grievous sin by having them. She\u2019s a regular kid having a regular reaction to a situation she\u2019s never had to navigate before.

Your sexuality or acceptance of it isn't a reason for people to celebrate, like it's great you're brave and owning who you are but beyond accepting you and respecting you people simply don't owe you anything else. I get it, I'm gay, coming out is this huge deal for us so an anticlimactic reaction can be disappointing to some but that's a good thing, I would sell my soul for an anticlimactic reaction compared to a shitty one, at the end of the day you have to remember that your reality is the baseline of what majority of closeted queer people pray for when they're ready to come out.

However, she\u2019s also a kid and there\u2019s a part of me that wonders if maybe this is feeling like such a big deal for her that and not having her parents react more and being so cool with it has kind of thrown her for a little bit of a loop. I know when I was around 13. My mom wanted to make sure that I knew that I could tell her anything about who I was interested in and if I wasn\u2019t interested in the opposite gender, then that would never be an issue for her.  Turns out I\u2019m straight, but I knew my parents really wouldn\u2019t have cared all that much as long as I was dating somebody nice.

And she\u2019s a kid, so hopefully she will grow and become more comfortable in her own skin, and in her own personhood.  And also realize that she is really lucky and there are a lot of people who steal face immense homophobia from their families, so not having your parents make it a big deal is actually a blessing.  But hey, we all didn\u2019t know all of our blessings when we were in high school it\u2019s a time when we\u2019re all meant to be a little bit more selfish because we\u2019re really trying to figure ourselves out and also developmentally break away from our family units a little bit more.", "Excellent analysis.

We also laugh that she absolutely sits like a bisexual meaning she'll use a chair anyway, but the way you're \"supposed to\". But at the end of the day he and I have talked about how she might still feel pressure about coming out to us (even as straight) when she starts really being interested romantically in other people.

But I still want to handle with care because being a kid is so hard.", "So here's the thing, coming out to someone you care about is like an iceberg. The actual coming out event is the part you see. But the internal work ahead of time can take years. Bisexuality can be tricky because you're still attracted to people you 've been generally socialized to be attracted to. That part seems easy and can throw off the journey. \n\nOn the other hand, you are learning that you have strong feelings towards people of your own gender. Is that friendship? Do you just really like being around that one person? It's very weird and it's so hard.\n\nSo you do the internal work and you build your courage and you tell your close friend. That in itself is scary and risky because they could absolutely turn on you and tell everyone else you hit on them which you aren't inherently doing. You could lose everything.\n\nBut your friend has a generally accepting non-reaction and you have an emotional response and now you're the dramatic one. Because you kind of are dramatic. You're a teenager. Being dramatic is kind of written into the source code.\n\nAt that point, it would be very cool of the friend to say something like \" you know what, I'm sorry if it seems like I didn't care. I do care and I think it's really cool. You told me. Now about that pizza...\"\n\nOf course your friend is young and inexperienced in life as well.

What kind of data were those trends based on? Did you just have to identify as bisexual yourself or were there other factors? According to [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10367109/), the disparity can be explained by the different ways men and women view sexual orientation and the data shows that same-sex and opposite-sex inclinations in human beings are independent of each other, coexist in individuals in different proportions, and will be roughly normally distributed in a population in which no social pressure exists to push people toward same-sex or opposite-sex inclinations.\n\nWho gets to determine whether someone is \"faking it\" or whether they are exploring their sexuality because they just aren't sure who they're attracted to yet? \n\nThere is a higher rate of men who identify as 100% heterosexual who also report attraction to men on some level than there are women in that situation. Does that mean that those men are faking heterosexuality? OF COURSE NOT."]}
