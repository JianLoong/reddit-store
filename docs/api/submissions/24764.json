It would annoy me too.\n\nI don't know which country you live in, but if your friend ever unblocks you and talks to you again, tell her to watch a TV show called Little Britain.\n\nThere's a character in it called Daffyd Thomas (played by Matt Lucas, who is gay). Daffyd believes he is \"the only gay in the village\", and sees persecution and lack of acceptance wherever he goes. In fact, everyone in the village is either gay themselves, or totally accepting and warm towards gay people. Every time Daffyd doesn't get something he wants (e.g. when he wasn't cast in the role of Hamlet), he claims it's due to the village's homophobia. Whenever he meets someone else who is gay, he is instantly hostile towards them.\n\nDaffyd behaves the way he does because he **wants** to be the only gay in the village.

I feel for the parents - how were they to know that just being accepting wasn't enough and it is a gift giving occasion these days?!", "NTA, tell her to get off social media and realize her parents accepted her. This isn't some movie or TV show. This is real life, and she's not the star.", "NTA.\n\nImagine being so privileged that you're upset that your parents were too supportive of you coming out.

That\u2019s the point no? It should be normal to be yourself?", "NTA, I am a straight female so my take might be wrong. But shouldn't that be the ideal response to a 'coming out' conversation? \n\nI am sure many people would love that response from their parents.\n\nIt seems to me they wanted attention from their parents and didnt like the response they gave but this surely was the ideal response for most people?", "Man, if it's one thing I can't stand it's people seeking more validation than they deserve.

It may now take her awhile to understand what you meant.", "NTA. Her parents responded exactly like they should, gave her a hug and made no fuss. \n\nBecause there should be no fuss or grumble about sexuality at all.

And as much as it hurts in that moment (no \"I live you no matter what\", \"I'm happy if you are happy\"...), compared to all the other coming outs I have witnessed over the years, it was one of the best I could get.\nAnd I know my mom loves me, no matter what, she never failed to tell and show me over the years! I think she was just a little shocked at this moment, I told her out of nowhere in a normal conversation.\n\n\nWhy is she expecting presents and stuff? I don't get it tbh. Other people get ass kicks and not the good ones, she should be grateful. I don't know anyone who got presents or parties after a coming out and I know lots of queer people...

If she'd come out as gay instead would you have put that in quotes too?\n\n\nBisexual erasure is a real thing that bi people deal with from both sides (the LGBT+ and straight communities).  People automatically assume that bi women are really straight and bi men are really gay.  Please don't contribute to that by giving the impression that you don't believe someone is really bisexual when they say they are.\n\nThat said, your friend is also TA (hence my verdict) for wanting more drama instead of being happy her parents accepted her coming out.", "NTA.\n\nYou told her to STFU: that *was* the reaction!

The whole purpose of LGBT+ rights and attitudes, is to treat people within the community with the equality that we treat heterosexual people... nobody bats an eyelid if someone comes out as straight (nobody comes out as straight anyway) so hardly reacting, accepting and carrying on with life is the best way to accept LGBT+ coming out moments.\n\nYour friend's words are ridiculous and she is clearly attention seeking, seeing that the reaction element (positive or negative) was more important than the familial honesty. This is a stupid priority. Given how many kids are disowned by parents for being LGBT+, your friend's words are actually disgusting and she needs to grow up.", "ESH. It\u2019s the putting bisexual in quotes that did it for me. Not sure why that was necessary and makes me question whether you\u2019ve actually been supportive. Of course I recognize that you wrote this after the falling out happened so I might be sensing some angry undertones but either way, the \u201cbisexual\u201d has asshole energy.\n\nETA: and obviously your friend sucks too but it also sounds like she just wants validation of her identity. Being a teenager was hard and I sort of get wanting to feel celebrated (regardless of whether you just came out or just had some other kind of success). That, however, can be insufferable as a friend or bystander.", "Ooof. NTA, but a soft one -- because maybe I'm reading a lot into this, but given her reaction I'm guessing her parents not caring about things is a common theme in her life, and I'm tempted to say N A H out of sympathy for her if that's the case. But I know I'm guessing, and I think she needed some sort of reality check in the moment, hence my judgement. \n\nHopefully she'll calm down and maybe get over herself a little bit. If so, and you get the chance, maybe suggest she talk to a counselor or some sort of professional about her need for attention. But until then, I think just give her some space.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she came out specifically to get a special prize, not because she wanted to share her truth.", "ESH. \n\nShe\u2019s a narcissistic asswipe, don\u2019t cry about her loss. \n\nI also understand the reaction you had and why you had it. You\u2019re also 17, so I don\u2019t expect perfect interpersonal communication. \n\nBut that was a serious asshole moment from you. A more reasonable reaction would have been to either try to help her see that using a calmer tone, or to just realize she\u2019s a narcissistic asswipe and quietly cut down on communication. So you get the asshole tag here too, but I think you know that and can learn from it.", "Being bi IS difficult too. It's an AH move to dismiss her experience. I'm not talking about the parents' reaction necessarily.\nAs a bi woman, there are many issues, the main one being nobody takes it seriously, most family/friends thinks it's a phase that will go away, or totally deny its existence. In my experience most of my gay/lesbian friends also rejected my sexuality, the straights think you're greedy and undecisive. When you're with a partner of one gender people stop seeing you as bi etc. \nHer reaction is over the top but just remember this, if you're going to remain friends :)", "NTA, the best reaction to someone coming out is acting as usual because it shows nothing has changed. If she's upset that they didn't make a big deal out of it, she didn't care about coming out to them or that they accept her she just wanted attention. Also, as opposed to what you write, they DO fully accept her, their reaction is accepting of her sexuality, it just isn't a big deal.", "NTA she needs to get off tiktok \ud83e\udd23", "Nta she sounds like a drama queen who wants people to make a big fuss over her", "So NTA. Your friend is hilarious and needs to grow up.", "NTA your friend is an attention seeking teenager and hopefully will eventually grow up", "NTA. Sounds like your \"friend\" might be though.\n\nI'm taking the loss of friends you mentioned as something painful that I won't mention the term for just in case, and if so I can completely understand your reaction.\n\nI know that bi erasure is a thing, but this certainly doesn't sound like that. And I know that some parents are just emotionless, and it doesn't sound like that either. It sounds like she's just wanting to be the centre of attention, and in the context of other friends you've lost, she should be more understanding and if she's blocking you, doesn't sound like a friend to me.", "NTA.\n\nHer parents are good parents (at least with this), she just wants drama so she has a look at me story to tell people or to have a hallmark moment. I'd trade her if I could, parents that stop seeing you as their child for being you is a weird kind of awful. Let her go be friends with people that'll reinforce her desire for drama, away from you.", "I feel like I see both sides of this, so I\u2019m gonna say no assholes here personally. I totally understand why you got angry that she was complaining over the lack of response, because it *could* be so much worse. But at the same time, it can feel so underwhelming to work yourself up to telling someone something that\u2019s so important, and then they don\u2019t have much of a response at all, and you just sort of feel like, hollow? I\u2019ve had both experiences, and they both feel shitty in their own ways. I feel like this is one of those things where comparing only ends up invalidating one experience or the other.", "NTA- Your friend isn't really bi. She just wants attention. That's my take.", "nta. i will get a lot of hate for that shit but a good part of the lgbt community is just attention seeking ... the same thing happens when teenagers start smoking.", "I know this sounds terrible but as a young queer woman, I would bet she is probably not gay and mostly wanted attention. \n\nComing out is terrifying, I know you know because of your other friend. The phrase \u201cat least then I would have gotten a reaction\u201d makes it clear that her biggest goal was to get a reaction. \n\nI don\u2019t know your friend, but I would also guess that her parents don\u2019t pay attention to her. Like enough to make her feel like they don\u2019t care about her. \n\nAnyways NTA, but I hope your friend (and the other friend) are okay", "It might not feel like it, but this is a classic case of mind reader syndrome. She expects a certain reaction from someone, and when she didn't get it, upset they didn't read her mind, she gets upset. What she should have done, is tell her parents, politely, how she feel and what she wants from them. What kind of reaction, a celebration, she wants to feel validated. \n\nYou get small ah score for just bursting out on here instead of being Any kind of support or advice (including Though love, which she need to hear so she can understand how misguided and lucky she really is.)\n\nESH.", "This could have been a good learning opportunity for her about other peoples' experiences, to gain a bit of insight/ perspective. But people rarely engage after being told to STFU. I wouldn't say YTA because of that, but expecting a different reaction from her seems ill-judged at best.", "YTA\n\nComparing these things isn't fair. Coming out is still a very big thing. She had obviously built it up in her head and is struggling with the low-key response. You're not really being fair to dismiss her venting with 'you don't know how lucky you have it'.\n\nShe does know. Coming out takes so much courage precisely because it can go so badly. There is an increasing move to normalise sexuality - which is awesome - but a surprising result is that it can feel like the courage it took to come out is sometimes devalued by people asserting that they don't care about the sexuality, or the courage behind the act of coming out. And when you take such a big step and make yourself so vulnerable, only to be told it doesn't matter, that hurts.\n\nSaying that that is meaningless because she could have been severely mistreated was unkind. Do you constantly compare everything anyone does to the worst case scenario? Does someone who says they're hungry get reminded that some people are starving so shut up? I hope not.\n\nYou're both still very young. I can forgive most of her comments simply because at 16, its very common to think of yourself first. Your brains are still developing. Were her comments a bit self-absorbed? Maybe. But your response was also unnecessary and insensitive. You do owe her an apology, if she's open to it. She might not be. Hopefully you both learn and grow from this either way.", "Of course YTA for saying that. She has better situation so you can be rude to her? She's looking for attention so you can be rude to her? You could just simply talk to her about others people's situation or at least just tell her to get over herself but you've chosen the worst way. That's why YTA.\n\nOthers peoples mistakes or way of thinking that we don't agree with don't give us excuse to be rude.", "Both of you are AH.  Keep clear of each other.

And I am really happy they don't make a big deal out of it. To them it's just another aspect of my personality, which as long as it doesn't directly affect them or me negatively is not an issue.\n\nI hate it when people make a giant deal out of their sexuality or gender.

Its just for the attention.", "You gave her the drama she wanted. \n\nAsk her for your present. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Presents and tears? Did she reveal that she\u2019s an olympic medalist too?\ud83d\udc80", "Isn\u2019t this what the LGTBQA+ is striving for? A society where they get the same reaction for being not straight as they would for being straight?", "It's that comment for me. Some LGBT people have 0 support from family and end up dying because of it, whether that be bc they have no safe place to live or bc of the effect on their mental health. She's an attention-seeking asshole of the highest regard. NTA", "thank you soldier it was bothering me too", "I can kind-of understand struggling with no reaction - I've never really come out to my parents on purpose, just didn't see a reason to hide my sexuality and they're chill with it, but there were other things I psyched myself up about they were chill about as well. In those moments, especially as a teenager with teenage emotions, it can be hard to handle all that fear and adrenaline with nowhere to go. \n\nThat being said, of course she needs to realize how lucky she is to have parents that react like this. Putting those emotions on her friend, especially when he's lost friends due to unaccepting parents, is not okay. She might want to talk to her parents about this- something like \"I've been really scared to tell you this, and your reaction really surprised me. Can we talk about that?\".

She was 14, in a bad family situation for years and basically desperate for attention. I tried to help her with some quality time and acted like a big sister, but she was stuck on the idea of being in the center of attention and she would do stupid stuff because of that. She would lie to her classmates about her family members being celebrities and other lies that kids much younger than her try to get away with, but her friends knew she was lying. \n\nOne day she told me she was gay and that she is in a relationship with a girl she never met but plays an online game with, and they use in-game chat. First I warned her about the fact that many people lie and use fake accounts on internet and that she shouldn't share personal information or invest her feelings in something like that. I only felt the need to tell her this because she was quite naive and immature for her age. She rolled her eyes and told me that I just hate her for being gay. I laughed and told her that I don't hate her (she knows it, we had these lessons/therapy talks for years, she was just testing me out to see the reaction) and I said that being gay is totally ok and that no one should care about who she likes except herself. I went on to talk about my gay friends and how their sexual orientation doesn't bother me at all and that neither myself, or anybody else has the right to be bothered by the life choices of others. \nThe moment she realised I was ok with gay, she started making homophobic comments about herself, like she was \"dirty\" and \"sinful\". I was worried because her family was a bit \"old school\" and thought she heard that from them, but it turned out she was just trying to provoke me to agree with that to get attention. She went on to make her instagram a shrine of gayness for a couple of months  as she started highschool. I got a full time job and stopped giving her lessons around that time, but I kept track of her and her academic achievements, and I am happy to say that she grew out of attention seeking and shouting \"I'm gay\" everytime someone spoke to her. She has good grades and gets attention for her talents and personality, not her sexual orientation. I hope this will happen to the OP's friend, too. \nSorry for the long comment.", "Also to add on, being flamboyant to an obnoxious degree and considering it homophobic when it isn't others cup of tea.", "Main characters wouldn't be this self-absorbed.", "I have a feeling that their daughter has a tendency to make big announcements and expect gifts as a result of this, and are trying not to enable this.

I remember wanting to see tears, screaming, celebration, anything! But getting a simple \"\ud83d\ude10 Okay\ud83d\ude12\" made me feel humiliated.\n\nI can also see why OP would find the friend annoying.

YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME!\" \n\nFriend 2: \"...\"\n\nIn Scenario A, Friend 2 is questioning whether Friend 1 is truly bi for no particular reason, aside from probably thinking that being bi isn't a thing, or something along those lines. That, in all likelihood, is rather biphobic.\n\nIn Scenario B, Friend 2 accepts Friend 1's sexuality and continues treating them as they always have before. Friend 1 then freaks out that they don't care about them. Friend 2 naturally wonders: \"most queer people just want to be accepted and treated the same as everyone else; so is my friend really bi, or are they just looking for a strong reaction out of me?\"\n\nNow, sure, I'm straight, so I you could rightly point out to the fact that I don't know anything about coming out as bi. But I would point out that a number of people here who identify as bi/queer have said the same thing (aka, \"it would be a dream to just be accepted and not treated any differently\"). And even if OP/myself are way off the mark, a much kinder and more effective reply would be: \"hey, I get why you're maybe wondering whether OP's friend is bi given their seemingly odd reaction.

If you consider the how friend\u2019s OP behave, she was def looking for some unhealthy reaction from her parents.

So I pushed that part of me down and assumed I was straight and just really really wanted strong \u2728friendships\u2728 with women (just like Xena). It took years to get through it.\n\nMy friends were wrong and they unknowingly did a lot of damage that could have been avoided if they had just trusted me. It's literally the same story.

Many bisexual women are nervous to start trying to date women because of this precise reaction.\n\nThe automatic assumption that people are pretending for social media is such a skewed way to view the world. The fact is that people are allowed to explore their sexuality. If a woman is curious about potentially being attracted to women and wants to try it out and feels comfortable with the label of bisexual that's no one's business.

So, yeah I agree that I think some (not all) women do claim to be bisexual to feel apart if the community.", "Maybe I can help you reframe that thought. Young people worry about being accepted, right? They're also just kind of learning about who they are in general and what they're attracted to.
