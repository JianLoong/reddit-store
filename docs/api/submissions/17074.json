UPDATE", "selftext": "So here's the [OG post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135aisz/aita_for_leaving_a_starbucks_midway_through_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSo it's been about a week or so now since my post, and wanted to give some updates and good news. Before that, I wanted to say thanks to all the comments from before. I\u2019ve felt like shit for the whole month of April and it helped that there were people telling me I\u2019m not shit. I\u2019ve listened to a lot of the comments, and most of them just say cut them off and move on, so I am.\n\nFirst thing is that, I've sent a link of my post to the \"friend group,\" to give them my perspective of things. I've understood that I've unintentionally made them feel uncomfortable during times. I don't know if I understand their whole perspective but thanks to that I know myself a bit more in social situations. They\u2019ve probably moved on from me but I just wanted to say some sort of goodbye. Now I've blocked them so I can move on and find others that will like me for me. Along with that, I know that I\u2019m gonna have some trust issues and overthinking things in the long run. Secondly, I've taken some tests, like the RAADS test and scored a 149 so I probably have some neurodiversity. I've went ahead and scheduled a ADHD assessment and will be taking it in the next coming week.\n\nWith this comes the good news for me, I've been hanging out with an online friend who I've known for a long while and actually lives like 15 mins away from me. (Lets call him Bob and if ur reading this, thanks man) I told Bob my situation with the friend group and he has helped me emotionally with it without me feel shit about the situation.  During this time, I've made him uncomfortable once by accident with me blurting my mouth. He did let me know how he felt so I apologized, told him it won't happen again, and I'm working on these things. I also got him some Anime Expo badge and a concert ticket to join me. The AX badge and concert ticket was originally gonna be for the \"friend,\" who said that he was unsafe with me. I was gonna surprise him with it as an early birthday present before what went down. I know it's a bit soon to give away the stuff but idk if I can find anyone soon.\n\nAnyways, I'm grateful for the advice you all gave to me. I do understand that there are some things that need to be fixed, some of the things said during the \"intervention,\" just need to be ignored, and somethings that I need to move on from. I'm mainly thankful that you guys help me understand myself a little more like my neurodiversity. Also sorry that this is a long post, I do just like to talk a lot. But yeah, if anyone has extra questions, I\u2019ll try to answer them as best as I can. I hope everyone have a great day and good friendships to never end.", "created_utc": 1683918113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ftx4d/aita_for_leaving_a_starbucks_midway_through_an/", "score": 1048, "replies": ["Wish you all the best. Normal people would have spoken to you about any issues they had well before staging some weird intervention.  \n\nEnjoy your Expo and hope Bob does too. You've a wide world out there to find friends who 'get you'. Expo sounds like a great place to find some  :)", "Good for you man", "Wish you all the best!", "It makes me really sad that those other people (I refuse to call them friends because that's not how friends act IMHO) chose to hold in their annoyances, talk about you beind your back and drop them on you all at once rather than having non confrontational conversations in the moment. They sound kinda immature and overly sure of themselves. Best wishes moving forward \ud83d\ude42", "\u201cBefore you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u2015 William Gibson\n\nThat said, I applaud you for seeking help and self improvement. Regardless of being neurospicy or not, no one... NO ONE deserves to be treated like you did. You can't fix a problem you know nothing about. Instead of coming to you one on one with their individual problems and explaining why THEY have a problem with it and asking for boundaries, they cornered you and belittled the ever loving shit out of you. Maybe they had valid concerns/complaints but that aboslutely WAS NOT the way to handle it.\n\nYou deserve so much better and I'm glad you had someone who took the time to look past your flaws and help you. He even went about it the right way when you said something that made him uncomfortable. No one WANTS to tell another person that something they did made them uncomfortable, confrontation can be weird. But how are we to properly respect one another if we dont PROPERLY address any issues. You can't fix what you don't know about. \n\nThat's all we can ever ask for. Someone to take the time to appreciate our flaws or\"isms\" and help us evolve.", "Something similar happened to me a little over a couple years ago, and I'm 30 now. It was a group of envious bullies, and they did it while I was recovering from a brain surgery. I didn't believe anything they said, though, because I was older than you and know who I am. I was just trapped in the \"intervention\" because my now-ex was secretly threatening me and suicide, and I was already trying to smoothly distance myself from that group. Their accusations were really bizarre, too, and were mostly about how I wasn't good enough for any of them. (Ironically, they were all attracted to me, and the ways they went about letting me know created the extreme discomfort that led me to trying to distance myself.)\n\nThey had apparently been manipulating my family behind my back, too, so it took months to extricate myself. They were relying on me having seizures and being medicated to make me vulnerable and falsely believed I had poor long-term memory, so they concocted completely false and contradictory stories. Luckily, I had saved text messages, recorded audio of these people behaving aggressively, and I recorded all phonecalls. \n\nI highly recommend recording the conversation whenever you suspect people are going to set you up for something like this again. Even if it's not legal to present in court, recordings can be shown to others as proof or just as a reminder to yourself of who to avoid and why.", "I went back and read the original post before reading this one and went \"Boy, I hope this person has gotten evaluated for ADHD,\" so it's good to see, upon reading this post, that you are, in fact, getting an ADHD assessment, because a lot of what you mentioned in that original post reminded me of the annoying things I do as a person with ADHD.\n\nRE: feeling like shit for all of April: look up rejection sensitive dysphoria and see if it jives with how you feel. If it does, knowing about it won't necessarily make the feeling like shit any better, but once I had the tools to recognize when my brain was making me feel shitty for being rejected, I was able to at least go \"Well, I feel terrible, but at least I know I feel terrible because my brain is malfunctioning and not because I *deserve* to feel terrible.\"", "Wishing you the best! Any friends who wait till an \"intervention\" at a public place to say something like that aren't your true friends, and while it sucks to lose them, they showed their true colors.", "The same thing happened to me a year and a half ago. Sounds like you\u2019re moving on quite well. It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve already started to realize that your true friends will hopefully like you for your quirks and qualities and will treat you how you deserve to be treated. I can tell you that I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been with my true friends, and once you fully move on (and take your time to do so), you\u2019ll feel so much better than you ever did with your \u201cfriends.\u201d", "This.", "I can't believe they did it in a Starbucks wtf these are same people that break up there too yikes", "The petty side of me hopes that that \u201cfriend\u201d sees this and saw that you got those tickets for them. Enjoy anime expo and the concert", "I hope you are doing well. I wish you the best in this new phase of your life and I would like you to remember that no one is perfect, we all have flaws that we work on to improve every day and it is important that you be gentle with yourself.\n\nI hope you know that working on yourself requires one step at a time at your own pace and at your own time.\n\nWish you so much happiness. I am sure that now you are going to have true friends because you are going to learn more who you are and who you want to have in your life.", "Although the intervention was late and done improperly in my opinion, it was useful on different levels just not for keeping that group of friends. It\u2019s awesome that you are taking away what you need to work on despite everything else with that group. There\u2019s a certain amount of givens in any equation. Who we are depends on how you respond. I suggest focusing on the toxic elements to see if you can find a cause because there always is. Finding that cause helps you deal with it and leave it behind for good. You seem to be very soul searching person so I won\u2019t say therapy because it might not be needed, but soul searching definitely. With your trust issues also analyze those. Take the situations where you lack trust, take the actions that are there and pair them with your feelings and see if the feelings are matching the events in a reasonable way. Not everyone will be your friend and not everyone will stab you in the back. You don\u2019t sound like you enjoy being an AH. Some people actually do so your way ahead from the start. Good luck with these things!", "Appreciate this and giving me the knowledge of the test which has me thinking a bit about myself...", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you man. I had something similar happen with my friends, and I still don\u2019t know where I stand with them. Hope you can find some better people!", "I'm so glad you found a GENUINE friend OP. I know what it's like to question myself after a terrible friend-group experience, and it took a couple of good people and an ADHD diagnosis to learn how healthy friendships are SUPPOSED to go.", "Good for you but I don't understand how come one gets uncomfortable because you blurt something out. Maybe it's just me but it seems like these people get upset over tiny things. Obviously I don't know the whole story but yea. Wish you luck", "Just sounds like the group wanted to oust the neurodivergent member for existing", "Neurospicy is now my new favorite word, thanks!", "Learning about rejection sensitivity dysphoria was such a game changer. I went from constantly being anxious that my friends were gonna leave me to getting to a place where we can even joke about \"the voice in my head being an AH again\" lol", "dude.", "That's what I was thinking also. What a freakin bombshell. \n\nI'm so sorry. \ud83e\udd7a", "I'm glad things are looking up!  \n\nGetting an ADHD diagnosis as an adult can be an emotional thing (speaking from experience) even if it does help you understand yourself better.  If you do get a diagnosis and can do therapy, I'd recommend it; it can be nice to have someone knowledgeable to talk things out with.  \n\nThere's an adhdmeme subreddit and an adhd subreddit.  Even if some things get posted that aren't necessarily adhd-specific, it's still nice to realize there are a lot of other people out there who can  understand and appreciate your struggles.", "Those guys are assholes the best thing you could do is cut them loose. \nIt is amazing that you are growing and learning from this. I hope those dicks learn from you and grow into better people. \n\nAs a fellow ADHD person, people who tell you right away what is bothering them is a massive help. Because we are not mind readers.  All the best! You got this! You are worthy of better people!", "Just read the original. What a bunch of hypocrites you had there.  \n\n>problems they\u2019ve had with me, like not being open enough with my feelings, having double standards...\n\nThey can't talk about any double standards and lack of openness if they were open about their problems with you to everyone except you. What a truckload of assholes you just dumped!", "When I read your first post the first thought that popped into my head was - ADHD. My son and I both have it. \n\nOP, if you do have ADHD just know there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. If you\u2019re impulsive (taking things without asking etc) those impulses can be managed with new tools and medication. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like a bad person to me at all! You sound like someone who has yet to find their tribe :)", "I'm sorry you lost your friends. That sucks.\n\nIn their minds, they were probably being good friends? In my opinion, they took it further than was necessary and did not try to understand the reasons why you might do some of the things you do. \n\nWhen you have undiagnosed conditions, it can be tough all round. It means no recognition, no understanding, and no reasonable adjustments. That is really hard.\n\nBob sounds like a top person though! I wish you all the best, and you will find more people who understand you and connect with you. \n\nHow do you feel about undertaking the ADHD assessment? Did it resonate when you read up about it?", "I\u2019m glad to hear it, I remember reading the original post and how many bad memories it brought back for me (same thing happened to me, there was an \u201cintervention\u201d, kind of kicked me out of the friend group, was undiagnosed at the time). I\u2019m so glad you were able to move on and meet new people, I wish you luck with pursuing your diagnosis!", "Glad you chose to cut them off. Even if they did notice actual toxic traits in you, their toxic trait is being AH enough to air your dirty laundry and talk shit about you in the middle of a public space. That's not an intervention, that's just bullying. Why choose the middle of the place otherwise? It was about humiliation, not about them feeling \"unsafe\".", "I\u2019m happy for you! If someone doesn\u2019t tell you that X bothers them, how are you supposed to know that X bothers them?", "Yeah, I get the need to hash issue out, but to do it in a Starbucks or any public place is scummy.", "There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s not mentioning what he said, despite the blurting out having made people uncomfortable multiple times. Dont forget everyone tries to paint themselves in the most favorable light here", "I hope the friend realizes what he lost with that gift OP was going to give him", "I haven\u2019t taken the assessment yet, but when I was taking the several online tests, I was reluctantly agree with a lot of the questions that the tests had. I didn\u2019t think that i had the possibility of having ADHD, but I know it\u2019ll help me in the long run", "\"Friend\" might not have felt safe going to the expo or concert with OP.  Might not have been enough people around!", "I saw the list of complaints your \u2018friends\u2019 had in the original post and my heart sank. No one bullies autistic people for *being* autistic, but most people will not hesitate to bully someone for *acting* autistic, even if they don\u2019t recognize that that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. I was diagnosed when I was about your age, and my best life advice\u2014which you are certain free to scoff at and mutter \u201cwhatever, old man,\u201d in response to\u2014is to find or gather a group of neurodivergents that all share one or two special interests or hyperfixations. \n\nThese can usually be found at your Friendly Local Game Store!", "Can you elaborate on what youre doing to make people this uncomfortable, including Bob?  \nIs it sexual in nature? Is this why your old friends will only meet you in public?", "That quote right there changed everything for me, thank you!", "I also had an ex like this. I was very young. I was secure in my person hood, but not familiar with these types of mind games. \n\nHe had them all convinced I had a psychotic break, with split personalities. That we were broken up and I couldn't accept it and trying to kill myself.  Most of our friends, my group of friends from prior to our relationship, and my family. \n\nWe lived several hours away from my friends and family, so I was isolated. They'd come down once a month. Every few months I'd go up to see them for a week. My normal self. He had them convinced it was an act. \n\nEveryone except my aunt and bff who was on the fence about it. My bff couldn't bring herself to believe if I was as bad as his claims, I'd pull it together so well when we'd visit. My aunt said when I have problems she's the first person I go to, immediately, so he could take his bs and shove it. \ud83d\ude06 I love my aunt. \n\nI didn't have brain surgery, that's crazy.\n\n But he did leave me all alone with an ear infection so bad it was bleeding and I was hallucinating. He told them to ignore me because I was making it up. \n\nThe next day, or two days after he left to visit his people, my Mom made the trip to come see me. That's when she realized what was going on. Straight to the ER and home with her I went. \n\nAll my prior to relationship support group started realizing what was going on. That was the beginning of the end of that relationship. It took time, because it was so hard for me to understand. \n\nWhen he called my bff to check in with \"how I was doing\" she started recording stuff he would tell them. She recorded the calls he made to me via speaker phone, so long ago lol. To prove the duplicity. He'd say we're broken up, I'm glad she's safe now. He'd call me and ask when I was coming home and talk weddings. Would I make meat loaf on Wednesday? He could pick me up in two hours. \n\nMy actual friends had the intervention what he was doing.\n\nThe sheep he convinced had an intervention about my \"mental health\" and \"compulsive lying.\" That I needed to \"stop making him look bad, leave him alone.\" \n\nNot even the ER paperwork, or recordings my friends had made could convince them dude was bad news, and I had been leaving him alone. At least 2 out of 6 were sleeping with him. \n\nThere's always a leader with that stuff, and the rest follow. \n\nThe craziest part about it to me, all these years later, is that no one said anything to me. Not one until the ear incident. He'd been telling those lies at least a year, maybe two. \n\nThat was the turn in events- probably because he knew he'd be caught with the proof from the ER. \n\nI got lucky. I know what group would've helped him bury my body. \n\nOP is NTA. Way better off without those type of friends.", "It\u2019s not in any sexual way, it\u2019s more of accidentally saying something that was in one\u2019s past I didn\u2019t know that they wanted it not to be brought up in public.", "Same.
