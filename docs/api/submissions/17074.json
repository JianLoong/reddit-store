UPDATE", "selftext": "So here's the [OG post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135aisz/aita_for_leaving_a_starbucks_midway_through_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSo it's been about a week or so now since my post, and wanted to give some updates and good news. Before that, I wanted to say thanks to all the comments from before. I\u2019ve felt like shit for the whole month of April and it helped that there were people telling me I\u2019m not shit. I\u2019ve listened to a lot of the comments, and most of them just say cut them off and move on, so I am.\n\nFirst thing is that, I've sent a link of my post to the \"friend group,\" to give them my perspective of things. I've understood that I've unintentionally made them feel uncomfortable during times. I don't know if I understand their whole perspective but thanks to that I know myself a bit more in social situations. They\u2019ve probably moved on from me but I just wanted to say some sort of goodbye. Now I've blocked them so I can move on and find others that will like me for me. Along with that, I know that I\u2019m gonna have some trust issues and overthinking things in the long run. Secondly, I've taken some tests, like the RAADS test and scored a 149 so I probably have some neurodiversity. I've went ahead and scheduled a ADHD assessment and will be taking it in the next coming week.\n\nWith this comes the good news for me, I've been hanging out with an online friend who I've known for a long while and actually lives like 15 mins away from me. (Lets call him Bob and if ur reading this, thanks man) I told Bob my situation with the friend group and he has helped me emotionally with it without me feel shit about the situation.  During this time, I've made him uncomfortable once by accident with me blurting my mouth. He did let me know how he felt so I apologized, told him it won't happen again, and I'm working on these things. I also got him some Anime Expo badge and a concert ticket to join me. The AX badge and concert ticket was originally gonna be for the \"friend,\" who said that he was unsafe with me. I was gonna surprise him with it as an early birthday present before what went down. I know it's a bit soon to give away the stuff but idk if I can find anyone soon.\n\nAnyways, I'm grateful for the advice you all gave to me. I do understand that there are some things that need to be fixed, some of the things said during the \"intervention,\" just need to be ignored, and somethings that I need to move on from. I'm mainly thankful that you guys help me understand myself a little more like my neurodiversity. Also sorry that this is a long post, I do just like to talk a lot. But yeah, if anyone has extra questions, I\u2019ll try to answer them as best as I can. I hope everyone have a great day and good friendships to never end.", "created_utc": 1683918113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ftx4d/aita_for_leaving_a_starbucks_midway_through_an/", "score": 461, "replies": ["Wish you all the best. Normal people would have spoken to you about any issues they had well before staging some weird intervention.  \n\nEnjoy your Expo and hope Bob does too. You've a wide world out there to find friends who 'get you'. Expo sounds like a great place to find some  :)", "Good for you man", "Wish you all the best!", "It makes me really sad that those other people (I refuse to call them friends because that's not how friends act IMHO) chose to hold in their annoyances, talk about you beind your back and drop them on you all at once rather than having non confrontational conversations in the moment. They sound kinda immature and overly sure of themselves. Best wishes moving forward \ud83d\ude42", "\u201cBefore you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u2015 William Gibson\n\nThat said, I applaud you for seeking help and self improvement. Regardless of being neurospicy or not, no one... NO ONE deserves to be treated like you did. You can't fix a problem you know nothing about. Instead of coming to you one on one with their individual problems and explaining why THEY have a problem with it and asking for boundaries, they cornered you and belittled the ever loving shit out of you. Maybe they had valid concerns/complaints but that aboslutely WAS NOT the way to handle it.\n\nYou deserve so much better and I'm glad you had someone who took the time to look past your flaws and help you. He even went about it the right way when you said something that made him uncomfortable. No one WANTS to tell another person that something they did made them uncomfortable, confrontation can be weird. But how are we to properly respect one another if we dont PROPERLY address any issues. You can't fix what you don't know about. \n\nThat's all we can ever ask for. Someone to take the time to appreciate our flaws or\"isms\" and help us evolve.", "Something similar happened to me a little over a couple years ago, and I'm 30 now. It was a group of envious bullies, and they did it while I was recovering from a brain surgery. I didn't believe anything they said, though, because I was older than you and know who I am. I was just trapped in the \"intervention\" because my now-ex was secretly threatening me and suicide, and I was already trying to smoothly distance myself from that group. Their accusations were really bizarre, too, and were mostly about how I wasn't good enough for any of them. (Ironically, they were all attracted to me, and the ways they went about letting me know created the extreme discomfort that led me to trying to distance myself.)\n\nThey had apparently been manipulating my family behind my back, too, so it took months to extricate myself. They were relying on me having seizures and being medicated to make me vulnerable and falsely believed I had poor long-term memory, so they concocted completely false and contradictory stories. Luckily, I had saved text messages, recorded audio of these people behaving aggressively, and I recorded all phonecalls. \n\nI highly recommend recording the conversation whenever you suspect people are going to set you up for something like this again. Even if it's not legal to present in court, recordings can be shown to others as proof or just as a reminder to yourself of who to avoid and why.", "I went back and read the original post before reading this one and went \"Boy, I hope this person has gotten evaluated for ADHD,\" so it's good to see, upon reading this post, that you are, in fact, getting an ADHD assessment, because a lot of what you mentioned in that original post reminded me of the annoying things I do as a person with ADHD.\n\nRE: feeling like shit for all of April: look up rejection sensitive dysphoria and see if it jives with how you feel. If it does, knowing about it won't necessarily make the feeling like shit any better, but once I had the tools to recognize when my brain was making me feel shitty for being rejected, I was able to at least go \"Well, I feel terrible, but at least I know I feel terrible because my brain is malfunctioning and not because I *deserve* to feel terrible.\"", "Wishing you the best! Any friends who wait till an \"intervention\" at a public place to say something like that aren't your true friends, and while it sucks to lose them, they showed their true colors.", "The same thing happened to me a year and a half ago. Sounds like you\u2019re moving on quite well. It\u2019s great that you\u2019ve already started to realize that your true friends will hopefully like you for your quirks and qualities and will treat you how you deserve to be treated. I can tell you that I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been with my true friends, and once you fully move on (and take your time to do so), you\u2019ll feel so much better than you ever did with your \u201cfriends.\u201d", "This.", "I can't believe they did it in a Starbucks wtf these are same people that break up there too yikes", "The petty side of me hopes that that \u201cfriend\u201d sees this and saw that you got those tickets for them. Enjoy anime expo and the concert", "I hope you are doing well. I wish you the best in this new phase of your life and I would like you to remember that no one is perfect, we all have flaws that we work on to improve every day and it is important that you be gentle with yourself.\n\nI hope you know that working on yourself requires one step at a time at your own pace and at your own time.\n\nWish you so much happiness. I am sure that now you are going to have true friends because you are going to learn more who you are and who you want to have in your life.", "Although the intervention was late and done improperly in my opinion, it was useful on different levels just not for keeping that group of friends. It\u2019s awesome that you are taking away what you need to work on despite everything else with that group. There\u2019s a certain amount of givens in any equation. Who we are depends on how you respond. I suggest focusing on the toxic elements to see if you can find a cause because there always is. Finding that cause helps you deal with it and leave it behind for good. You seem to be very soul searching person so I won\u2019t say therapy because it might not be needed, but soul searching definitely. With your trust issues also analyze those. Take the situations where you lack trust, take the actions that are there and pair them with your feelings and see if the feelings are matching the events in a reasonable way. Not everyone will be your friend and not everyone will stab you in the back. You don\u2019t sound like you enjoy being an AH. Some people actually do so your way ahead from the start. Good luck with these things!", "Appreciate this and giving me the knowledge of the test which has me thinking a bit about myself...", "I\u2019m sorry this happened to you man. I had something similar happen with my friends, and I still don\u2019t know where I stand with them. Hope you can find some better people!", "I'm so glad you found a GENUINE friend OP. I know what it's like to question myself after a terrible friend-group experience, and it took a couple of good people and an ADHD diagnosis to learn how healthy friendships are SUPPOSED to go.", "Good for you but I don't understand how come one gets uncomfortable because you blurt something out. Maybe it's just me but it seems like these people get upset over tiny things. Obviously I don't know the whole story but yea. Wish you luck", "Just sounds like the group wanted to oust the neurodivergent member for existing", "Neurospicy is now my new favorite word, thanks!", "Learning about rejection sensitivity dysphoria was such a game changer. I went from constantly being anxious that my friends were gonna leave me to getting to a place where we can even joke about \"the voice in my head being an AH again\" lol", "dude.", "That's what I was thinking also. What a freakin bombshell. \n\nI'm so sorry. \ud83e\udd7a"]}
