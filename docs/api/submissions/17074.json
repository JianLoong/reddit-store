UPDATE", "selftext": "So here's the [OG post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135aisz/aita_for_leaving_a_starbucks_midway_through_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSo it's been about a week or so now since my post, and wanted to give some updates and good news. Before that, I wanted to say thanks to all the comments from before. I\u2019ve felt like shit for the whole month of April and it helped that there were people telling me I\u2019m not shit. I\u2019ve listened to a lot of the comments, and most of them just say cut them off and move on, so I am.\n\nFirst thing is that, I've sent a link of my post to the \"friend group,\" to give them my perspective of things. I've understood that I've unintentionally made them feel uncomfortable during times. I don't know if I understand their whole perspective but thanks to that I know myself a bit more in social situations. They\u2019ve probably moved on from me but I just wanted to say some sort of goodbye. Now I've blocked them so I can move on and find others that will like me for me. Along with that, I know that I\u2019m gonna have some trust issues and overthinking things in the long run. Secondly, I've taken some tests, like the RAADS test and scored a 149 so I probably have some neurodiversity. I've went ahead and scheduled a ADHD assessment and will be taking it in the next coming week.\n\nWith this comes the good news for me, I've been hanging out with an online friend who I've known for a long while and actually lives like 15 mins away from me. (Lets call him Bob and if ur reading this, thanks man) I told Bob my situation with the friend group and he has helped me emotionally with it without me feel shit about the situation.  During this time, I've made him uncomfortable once by accident with me blurting my mouth. He did let me know how he felt so I apologized, told him it won't happen again, and I'm working on these things. I also got him some Anime Expo badge and a concert ticket to join me. The AX badge and concert ticket was originally gonna be for the \"friend,\" who said that he was unsafe with me. I was gonna surprise him with it as an early birthday present before what went down. I know it's a bit soon to give away the stuff but idk if I can find anyone soon.\n\nAnyways, I'm grateful for the advice you all gave to me. I do understand that there are some things that need to be fixed, some of the things said during the \"intervention,\" just need to be ignored, and somethings that I need to move on from. I'm mainly thankful that you guys help me understand myself a little more like my neurodiversity. Also sorry that this is a long post, I do just like to talk a lot. But yeah, if anyone has extra questions, I\u2019ll try to answer them as best as I can. I hope everyone have a great day and good friendships to never end.", "created_utc": 1683918113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ftx4d/aita_for_leaving_a_starbucks_midway_through_an/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Wish you all the best. Normal people would have spoken to you about any issues they had well before staging some weird intervention.  \n\nEnjoy your Expo and hope Bob does too. You've a wide world out there to find friends who 'get you'. Expo sounds like a great place to find some  :)", "Good for you man", "Wish you all the best!", "It makes me really sad that those other people (I refuse to call them friends because that's not how friends act IMHO) chose to hold in their annoyances, talk about you beind your back and drop them on you all at once rather than having non confrontational conversations in the moment. They sound kinda immature and overly sure of themselves. Best wishes moving forward \ud83d\ude42"]}
