I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located, but is there a social worker or counselor at your school? I would strongly encourage you to reach out to them!

What are they doing? Taking care of your sibling is NOT your job to do.

You absolutely should not be routinely responsible for your siblings throughout the night. I'm sorry your parents are slacking at *their* responsibilities, but that is **not** *your* fault. By any means. \n\n> They always remind me that my problems at school are small compared to their problems.\n\nAnd? What does that matter? (I say this to them, not you.) Of course their problems are more complicated, they are adults. *Your* problems are only so complicated because of *their* lack of ability/responsibility. **NTA.**", "NTA.  This is not your responsibility.", "NTA that is your parents job, not yours. I highly encourage you to see the school counselor. If your teachers become aware of your home situation there is a chance they will extend deadlines for you and offer you extra assistance to help you catch up.", "NTA, though I\u2019m wondering how financially feasible it is for your parents to hire a nanny when it seems like they can\u2019t keep gas in the car (I\u2019m assuming this is out of lack of funds and not just laziness as stopping for gas on the way to school would have been the solution there instead of just staying home).\n\nYour schooling is incredibly important and your absences can become a truancy problem for your parents that can land them into legal trouble if they\u2019re not careful.  Even if a nanny isn\u2019t a realistic possibility, something has got to give as it is not okay to rely on you so heavily to babysit it\u2019s interfering with your ability to go to school.

You\u2019re too young to be stuck with all this responsibility.", "Absolutely NTA!! You are not, and should not be made to be responsible for your own sibling. Your parents chose to have kids. They knew they were expensive, yet they chose to have kids. The financial burden and the responsibility that comes with it is their responsibility! They shouldn't be expecting the older sibling to be the parent of their younger sibling.  It sounds like you're expected to be the parent to their child round the clock and that's not something you signed up for or should be expected to do. You should be allowed to get a good education and should be allowed to have the time to go out and spend time doing hobbies that you enjoy and be allowed to make new friends and spend time with those friends. You shouldn't be expected to take care of their child. Let alone for free. They need to be caring for the kid they chose to have or pay for a nanny during the times that they can't. It's totally unfair to you, and I'm sorry that you have terrible parents. Depending on how old you are, you could go to authorities, and that would probably leave both of you in a better situation. You deserve so much better and I'm sorry they put so much responsibility on you. That's just so unfair, and that can cause problems with mental health, even down the line if you're given a parental role at a very young age. You didn't say how old you were or how long this has been going on, but if it happened young enough, it could have even more lasting effects on your mental health than it does just right now. I hope that your parents can find a solution that gives you the time you need to do well in school and to have some freetime and some good sleep!", "NTA for wanting to focus on school at all....

Like I and everyone else said: your sibling is not your responsibility", "Thank you for that. Is it normal for me to feel guilt that I have upset them with my expression?", "Why would you feel guilt? Making the oldest kid be the parent to the youngest is a form of neglect. No child should have to take on the responsibility of another child.

Even calling you ungrateful once is enough that you would feel guilty and that's completely valid! For them to be upset is normal only for toxic people. And if your brother sleeps during the day because they work during the day, then they're EXTREMELY EXTREMELY irresponsible. People who stay up all night and sleep in the day are proven to have shorter lives and we simply don't get as good of sleep with sun shining through the window. So this would likely be affecting his growth. But that's just ok with them? It's one thing if he just is on his own, it's pretty typical of young babies and young children to be awake part of the night. If that's how if is, and he just does it with no encouragement at any point from them to flip his sleep schedule, then it's probably normal and he'll probably grow out of it and be perfectly fine doing so health wise. But if it's not, they're discouraging growth and shortening his life. It will also be hard for him to adjust when he starts school. None of this should be on you to take care of. You deserve to have a happy life where you have time to grow up and do well in school. Your feelings are valid and nothing is your fault.

Your parents are going to be able to \" push your buttons\" because they are the ones who installed them.

You could do it online when you are up with your sibling. Once you have it, gather your important papers: birth certificate, social security card ( if in US), lock down your credit and move out.

Saying your troubles at school are nothing compared to their work troubles is invalidating bullshit.
