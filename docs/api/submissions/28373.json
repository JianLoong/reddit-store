Kind of a bizarre take from your friend. \n\nMy only thought is that their home life is difficult for other reasons and they were lashing out because they were feeling jealous or something like that. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t take it to heart, and once this has blown over a bit you could ask about it in a roundabout way.", "NTA. They asked, you answered. Honestly, they're TA for insulting your grades (and the friends aren't much better.)", "NTA, she shouldn't be mad because you were just saying your routine. It seems to me that you weren't bragging at all", "NTA\n\nI'm confused at what part of your routine illustrates a lavish lifestyle.  It sounds like you do the dog chore, have a snack, read, homework, nap, eat, more homework, where is the lavish part?", "NTA- You get stuff done and enjoy your time, that is not bragging, just answering the question. Your friend is likely just mad that you do not obsess over grades the way she does and you have a break from school that she doesn't have. It doesn't make you bad.", "NTA. I don't understand why she feels this is bragging. Not everyone does the same stuff so your routine is different than hers just as I'm sure other people have different routines. She and her friends need to stop being difficult.", "NTA.  You weren't bragging, you were being honest.\n\nWhat your friend wanted was for you to say you studied non-stop, or to complain about how much homework your teachers were giving you.  Anything but the idea that with a little food, a good book and a dog, life can be more than OK.", "> 16F\n\nAh, now the story makes sense, because this is some grade-A teenager drama bullshit.\n\nNTA. I love how a dog, reading, eating, homework, TV, and sleeping equals a \"lavish lifestyle\".", "NTA.\n\n\u2026seriously, *what*? How is any of that a \u201clavish lifestyle\u201d especially when you apparently don\u2019t have as high of grades as the people that just said \u201cdo homework\u201d? Tf?", "I feel like there must be more to this because I don't understand other people taking her side.", "NTA\n\nThis is a weird thing to be mad over. You were asked what you did after school and you answered. You're allowed to be on your own schedule when home.", "NTA those are some bad \"friends\"", "NTA these are all... very standard things to do tbh. Sounds like something else is going on with them.", "Your schedule doesn't even sound like a brag, that's very ordinary (minus the nap right before bed, wtf sleep schedule).

You can't control her environment. Just feel lucky that you have more freedom and have a less stressful environment. Or maybe I am just thinking too much...\n\nNTA", "NTA- they\u2019re weird and uptight. Nothing lavish about what you did, you just have a different way of doing things and different priorities. If they wanted to do that they could, unless they\u2019re insecure about their intelligence. You need friends that are more like yourself.", "nta and whaaaaaat? no idea how your friend got the impression you were bragging. sounds like a comfortable routine", "NTA\n\ni am failing to see what is lavish about your after school routine. It all looks fairly standard to me. That said, maybe fitting in some extra study time would improve your grades, also it\u2019s good the get into practice to do some study each day even if you start with only 10 minutes", "NTA.\n\nSchool and homework isn't everything. Guarantee that pretty much all of them will get crushed by higher education despite being straight As students in high school. You have a healthy routine that balances school work with relaxation.", "Nothing you said is lavish. NTA for answering the question", "NTA, obvs. But yeah, as that sounds like a very normal afternoon, not at all \"lavish,\" OP might want to find out what is going on with the friend. They may need some help. It might just be that they have to work after school, or that they want a dog, or that there's no way they can nap in the afternoon, but it might be that they're food insecure. If OP is OK with it, offering to study occasionally (with snacks or even dinner) might be a kind thing to do, but while couching it as \"can you help me out as your grades are better than mine.\"", "My guess?  Her parents are waaaaay more into the \"academics uber alles\", which translates into \"you can have fun when you're dead\".", "I don\u2019t know, she never answered when I tried to ask more about it so I decided to just give her space..", "I do the homework but I only put enough effort to pass. Doing more stresses me out and then I would have no motivation to any homework which is bad. So I\u2019ve decided to get enough to pass while also not putting myself under a lot of stress. It\u2019s also why I split up my homework with a nap and food.", "I can sleep almost at anytime and anywhere really, I just need a Power Nap to continue my homework", "I would but I never put more than enough Into my grades because it causes too much stress and that would mean less motivation to do the work. I also can\u2019t study for more than three minutes, it\u2019s boring to me and I can\u2019t sit still for very long.", "I bet her parents don't let her do that and the pressure she gets from them to work so hard is why your afternoons sound lavish.  She's envious.", "I may be missing something but what about your after school routine does she consider lavish?  NTA", "God, I do *not* miss being your age.\n\nIt sounds like your friend is really stressed out, and she's lashing out at you because, well, you're happy and she isn't. \n\nNTA. Don't respond to your friends about this.", "Wait what lol? Apparently your friend studies for hours every night between shifts at the coal mine. Only rich people have dogs and take naps\n\nNTA", "Did you say anything else? Because that doesn't make sense unless you were disrespectful of her answer.", "NTA. That was an extreme overreaction. Unfortunately she may have something else going on that has nothing to do with you but you found yourself on the receiving end of her frustration. That\u2019s definitely not ok.", "NTA\nI\u2019m sorry but this is such a highschool thing to do. Not on your part. On your friends", "NTA, stay away from that girl she\u2019s jealous and it shows! She\u2019s been jealous..", "I don\u2019t know, she stopped talking to me and my questions got unanswered. I wish I knew though", "Question: could it be related to any family life? I know that\u2019s how I work and in my 30s I still feel anxiety when I\u2019m sitting around doing nothing when I could be doing something because of how my parents reacted to not doing anything and lazy and they\u2019d get upset with me. Maybe they don\u2019t mean lavish like spoiled but having \u201cthe luxury of not getting grief from your family\u201d ability to do that. \n\nLong shot but that\u2019s where my head went even tho, I\u2019d never have reacted like that and it does seem a bit odd.. maybe your friends agreed with her bc they know?\n\nEdited for spelling.", "Okay, that's kind of a humble brag :P", "Hm. Of course, I don't know you, but have you considered asking your parents to have you evaluated for ADHD? If you're in the US you can have that done for free through the public schools, even if you yourself do not attend a public school. You sound much like everybody in my family, and we're all ADHD or autistic or probably both. (My mother even used to drink coffee before bed, to help herself fall asleep! I told her that was practically diagnostic in and of itself.)"]}
