I'm not crocheting tampon doilies for the dining room...", "NTA Sanitary products are kept in the bathroom where they are used.", "NTA, super weird to store them on a communal eating surface.

Asking for any kind of consideration, trying to figure out why something was the way it was, trying to get my mom to do things differently, if I didn't just let her do what she wanted, I was \"attacking\" her.

Also stating the issue as being embarrassing for company to see, is low key shaming.", "NTA.
