Also stating the issue as being embarrassing for company to see, is low key shaming.", "NTA.

So why didn't you just put them in the bathroom and tell her \"hey Ma, I put your pads in the bathroom under the sink\" and make that the end of it?\n\n*Edited to correct spelling", "Well you can keep stash in kitchen but in a hidden cupboard not on the table...", "Ah I didn't realize that was their permanent home. I assumed they were from a grocery trip and not yet put away.", "Yea it\u2019s still no different. It\u2019s just a necessary object in the house no matter what it is. You\u2019re making a much bigger deal out of this than you should be. Would you feel the same way if there was a baby in the house and there was a box of diapers in the same spot?", "But you didn't. If you had just put them in the bathroom rather than asking her to to do it - this would not be an argument.\n\nYou were tasking your mother.\n\nAs a mother of an adult son, this is dangerous territory.\n\nYou want something done, do it. You want your mother to do something on your timetable...you have now seen how that goes.\n\nYTA", "So drop it. If you didn\u2019t think it was weird or shameful you wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed by it. They\u2019re sterile, clean packed away in the box. Not worth an argument", "Weird and shameful over a box of something lmao, so unbelievably dramatic", "do people really judge others for having that stuff out? i seriously can\u2019t imagine caring if someone had that on in their kitchen, especially since i\u2019m a guest in their home", "Our toilet paper sits pack on top an unused table in the kitchen, it\u2019s really not a big deal", "Where would he put all that stuff? Then move it there don\u2019t point and whine", "Do you honestly think a used, disgusting cum rag is the same as unopened hygiene products? Is that the argument you want to go with when you're trying so desperately to convince us in other arguments that you're not trying to be rude, you just care about cleanliness etc etc? \n\nGrow up.", "Not remotely the same. What are you, twelve?", "Wow nice of you to reveal you truly are an AH in likely every aspect of your life", "It hit shaming levels when he talked about it being embarrassing for people to see the pads, like there is something specifically embarrassing about pads. If he'd said something about it being more practical to keep it in the bathroom or that it got in his way or even just that he didn't think it was a good place because you don't use pads in the kitchen then it would be fine.", "Underwear are reusable. \n\nPads are disposable. \n\nThey\u2019re literally packaged inside a box/plastic & then individually wrapped. \n\nYou\u2019re just being rude to her to be rude. You weren\u2019t even having company \u2014 it was just an other excuse c", "Ah, these things happen. I'm sure it will blow over.", ">Threatened to *move out*. \n\nOh my bad, threatened to move out and screw her over financially. Better? \n\n>Not in the slightest\n\nThen what was the reason?", "Dude - periods in general are just pretty awful, honestly. They suck. Noone ever wants to hear about them, they don't want to know that you are on them, and we get called irrational and emotional at that time of the month. We are bloated, hangry, and generally just pissed off and we have to go around pretending like all is well while gushing blood from our vaginas... And this happens every. Single. Month. \n\nThen, heaven forbid your child sees your period products on the dining room table and says \"Mother, get these things out of my sight, they are offensive in this particular location! What will our guests think?!?\".\n\nJust try see it from her perspective. Noone wants to know about our periods and sometimes it just sucks because a bit of kindness about this reality of ours would be nice.", "Okay, in that case, I'm glad you didn't move them yourself, it would have caused more drama. This is what I suggest: Talk to your mother, tell her you support her feminism, and you want to be an ally to her, so you propose putting the pads front and center in the bathroom, because having them in the kitchen is inappropriate, not because they're a reminder of menstruation, but because they belong in the bathroom, where they get used. You don't put nail clippers in the fridge. Everything has its place.", "Well then you should pick things up.  It\u2019s not that big of a deal to move pads to the bathroom.  And again talk to your mom because this is a really odd hill to die on.", "He could have just put them away and if the mom got upset then that would have been an issue. It's also the fact that he said it's embarassing, it shouldn't be, he is grown, those are just pads.", "I really wish I had of just done that. I\u2019m not grossed out by them by any means, but I don\u2019t want to have to see them every time I\u2019m in the kitchen", "Bahahaha! Just visualizing this made me snort laugh!", "Maybe she\u2019s Mrs. Incredible/Elastigirl??", "Literal LOL", "Well yeah hindsight is a great thing. I do wish I did that haha", "Agreed, tbh", "Nah, I\u2019m with OP on this one. Sanitary pads should not be left in the kitchen. Neither should diapers.", "Ngl anything that isn't a kitchen item (paper towel, pot, pan, bowl, ect) that's on the kitchen table is embarrassing. So yeah. Move the pads, move baby diapers, pretty much anything else should be moved. It's necessary, sure, but is she changing her pad in the goddamn kitchen?!", "If you have a baby visiting, then fine, if said baby lives there and constantly needs them, then it stands to reason you store them in the room where you change them, along all necessary things to clean and care for the baby's skin, that place is not the kitchen table...", "Yeah but they belong in the bathroom. I\u2019d feel the same about jock itch cream lol.", "The pads aren't shameful.   What's shameful is to be so lazy as to be a slob and just have everything laying around helter skelter and not put away.   I don't know if she just has a thing for having her pads everywhere or if she is a slob that never puts anything away and stuff is strewn all over.", "It\u2019s a normal bodily function, nothing disgusting about it, stop trying to shame me. \n\nI wasn\u2019t rude to her when I asked her, I was really polite. Being rude now doesn\u2019t change that", "Why are you trying to shame me?", "Yes a vulgar joke on reddit describes every aspect of my personality", "I\u2019m not being rude to be rude, it wasn\u2019t an excuse, I asked her to put away her pads off the kitchen table and I made a real attempt to be as nice as I could about it", "Yeah probably. Maybe I need to learn to just use my initiative a bit more rather than expecting other people to do things.", "Screw her over financially!? I\u2019m paying her mortgage on a house that\u2019s 30km from my work even though I\u2019m on part time hours so she can pursue her dream job in another county. Retracting that isn\u2019t me screwing her over financially. \n\nThe reason was her reaction to a simple request.", "But she talks about her pains and stuff to me constantly, i never reply negatively to her or tell her I don\u2019t wanna hear it (tbh I absolutely don\u2019t, but I hold my tongue out of respect). I really made an effort to be polite when I was asking her.\n\nI appreciate you taking your time to write that out", "He could but, then he'd be in the wrong for moving her stuff without permission. I agree if its embarrassment over the fact that they're pads. But I would be embarrassed that things were soo out of place that someone left bathroom products in the kitchen.", "Can you not just put them in the bathroom from now on?", "Dude just let it go. My kitchen growing up had a cabinet full of different medications. Sure plenty of people store them in the bathroom, we stored them in the kitchen. Who gives a shit? People do things differently, your mom has her way. Let it go and stop being mean to your mom.", "No one said it wasn't a normal bodily function, but I hope you and your mom leave your cum soaked rags and your period stained pads everywhere on the kitchen table now. That's the only way it's equal. Another way it's equal is if you buy a rag to make it your cum rag and then leave it on the table with the pads BEFORE you cum in it. There. That's how easy it is to respect normal bodily functions AND hygiene at the same time without confusing them! \n\nWell, if you're asking for judgement of your own accord in this sub, then yeah it does make a difference that you're rude now. Because before, you were TA and now it's you're a massive TA who needs a few more bio lessons, apparently", "You\u2019ve shamed yourself. Grow up.", "Yes it does That and your post.", "So leave. Because you're embarrassed by the sight of pads instead of just putting them in her room or something.", "I don't think you are the bad guy here. I think it just touched a nerve and things blew out of proportion. You sound like a supportive son, OP.", "I don\u2019t think they are literally equal ffs", "Stop trying to start a fight", "It really doesn\u2019t", "Well yeah I wish I had of just put them away without saying anything. I didn\u2019t think it would be a big fucking deal to ask her about it though", "I\u2019m telling you the truth. You\u2019re the one who asked opinions and are arguing with everyone. That was the joke of a young teenager, you\u2019re too old for this level of angst.", "Sure Jan", "I think it became a big deal because you kept calling them embarrassing to see. It's fine to not want them to sit around on the kitchen table but it's hardly something worth being embarrassed about like it's shameful to be seen. That's the issue your mother was having."]}
