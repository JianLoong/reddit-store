Ur MIL had her kids, had her time to control every aspect of a person's life, and now she needs to move aside and allow her son and his wife control all aspects of thier sons life until his old enough.

Obviously, you're not an asshole for having the most basic rights.

Don't let her ruin this time for you. \n\nBlock her and, for now at least, anyone who is taking her side. \n\nHave your husband reach out to his family and tell them that you two don't need the added drama are taking a time out from them to focus on your newborn. \n\nOnce you two have a chance to catch your breath, he can reach back out to other family and set the record straight on any lies she has told.", "NTA: It sounds like MIL is going to get some lessons in boundaries and how you and your husband are going to hold her to them.

Wow. I just... wow. \n\nShe can accept the name and let you parent YOUR baby, or she can stay away. Same goes for anyone taking her side.", "Nta post in just no mil aswell. Looks like she will be sitting in the nc and info diet corner soon. Congrats on your son.", "NTA. She owes you an apology. She violated your boundaries by going to the delivery and harassing you before you gave birth. Then tries to push your husband to go behind your back. Then to lie to make herself the victim. Hopefully your husband is on the same page, and will not let her see your son until she apologizes and confess to the truth. Not a moment before. And a true apology.", "NTA. You just had a baby and this crazy lady is trying to pressure you to change your child\u2019s name!

Not just support you, he should have shut that down and kicked her out. You were the patient. You were busy birthing a human into the world. He should have taken care of his mother before you had to.
