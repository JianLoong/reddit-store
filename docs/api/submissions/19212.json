I\u2019d cut her off immediately right now, don\u2019t let MIL think she can carry on like this or even ramp it up. Nip it in the bud ASAP (please!!)", "NTA - you can always kick a MIL out of the room without being an AH, you don\u2019t even need a reason", "NTA\nUmmmm the mere fact that she asked the nurses if she could legally change the kid\u2019s name?! \nBoundaries are clearly not her strong suit\u2026.if she even knows what they are to begin with. \nGotta put mama (in law) in her place now or never.", "NTA\n\nHusband should have kicked her out as soon as she arrived since you only wanted him in with you.\n\nWhen we were prepping in the final weeks our OBGYN asked who was going to be allowed in the room or if anyone in particular should be banished to the waiting room. Wife chose not to limit, but left it up to me in the moment. If I had seen her getting uncomfortable because of anyone I would have asked them to leave, and would have had the full backing of the entire staff.", "NTA - but your entitled, controlling, gossipy, and dishonest MIL is.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA.", "Lmao. NTA. I did not tell anyone the name of our baby until I filled out the paperwork and gave it to the lady at the hospital to file. \n\nMy in laws are also very opinionated and I wanted my MIL out of the hospital ASAP. She stayed with us for 3 months after trying to control every aspect. Had to eventually put my foot down with my wife and asked her to get them to leave. I took 2 months off from work to help my wife instead and things were easy, fun and smooth once my in-laws left.", "NTA.  Cut her psycho ass out of your lives.", "NTA. She's a toxic boundary pusher who does not deserve your patience. She's not worth your peace of mind. You JUST had a baby. If she's already causing problems, then she's got to go. Tell her that if she can't be supportive and is instead a distraction from your parenting responsibilities, then you've got to go no contact for the time being as your son is your priority. Decide how to handle her later when you have more sleep and not a brand spanking new baby. Enjoy being a new mom! \ud83e\udd70", "NTA. Do not ever tolerate that behavior it just encourages them to be worse", "Nta", "NTA. And your husband is a decent human being for having your back. As for her family, ignore them - they are not your problem. Let your husband deal with his side of the family, or cut them off, as he chooses.  \nAnd did I understand wrong, or did your MIL crash into the room where you were having the baby? That merits total cutting off and no contact, of her and of any relative who supports her.", "NTA. Congratulations on the birth of your son. Your L&D team failed you by letting her in the room. So did your husband. Anyone who is calling you names should be blocked from calls, texts, and social media, going forward. You are the one who is owed an apology, but MIL is obviously a lying liar who lies a lot. Let your husband deal with his kooky family, and you concentrate on healing and welcoming your child.", "NTA. You're the mother and your husband's wife. She needs to respect you as such including your decisions and your space. If she can't (and obviously won't), I would cut her out of your life immediately. This garbage doesn't get better over time.", "NTA\n\nYou should have had her removed from the room immediately, frankly.\n\nYou've married into a family of assholes, by the sound of it. I'm sorry. I hope your husband has your back because it's not going to be easy if they're acting like this now ... it will likely only get worse, so you mayhave some hard  decisions to make about going low or no contact in the near future.", "NTA. I'm assuming it isn't a crazy name that will negatively impact the baby's life? You still wouldn't be the AH because your kid, your choice. But that's the only logical reason a family member should criticize someone's baby name.", "NTA why was she even in your room? We need boundaries with Mil stat and cut everyone out of your life that sides with her. Those are her informants and would only talk shit later.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure why MILS are so obsessed with the name choice. I\u2019m surprised you let her stay at the hospital when you said you only wanted your husband there. This is way beyond her not liking the name. She tried to change it behind your back and that is crazy. Draw this firm boundary with her now or it will only get worse. She will make decisions behind your back and honestly she wouldn\u2019t be left alone with your child if it were me. And if any family bashes you then tell them the full story. I\u2019d be surprised if anyone would be ok with her going behind your back to try to have your child\u2019s name legally changed.", "NTA.  What kind of delusional crazy woman tries to hijack a baby name while a woman is in labor?!?!?  Cut her off completely and be done with that craziness.  Congrats on your son,  I hope you and baby are both healthy.", "NTA. The nurses fucked up. They should have thrown her out well before you did. And can I say, I\u2019m shocked by the unmitigated gall of that woman.", "NTA - it's your child, not hers. She's trying to hit you at your most vulnerable time and she failed. Good on you!", "NTA, and thank all the stars that you have a husband with a shiny spine.  YOU!  Block her.  It's his mother, and his issue to deal with now.  You do not have any interaction with her at all.  That way, she can scream into the void and you don't have to deal with it.", "No, You\u2019re not tah! I\u2019d block her number so she can\u2019t send abuse! Or even report the abuse!. Your Husband needs to get a backbone and stand up to his mother as if he\u2019d done that in the first place she wouldn\u2019t be lying and sending nasty messages.", "NTA and good on your husband for defending you. Now he really does need to cut her off for a while. Then every time she brings this shit up or gets someone else involved she gets another time out. Start extending the time outs or just cut her off completely. Something tells me this isn't the first time she's crossed the line if your husband jumped right into cutting her out. Block her number now so you can just be a mom for right now and take care of your baby without her bullshit.", "Nta dont understand people like that. That's not your kid you don't have a right to name him.", "Absolutely NTA. You should probably just go completely no contact with her. Your husband may also want to just cut her loose because *\"She asked the nurses if she could legally change his name.\"* is waaaaay over the line. Like, here's the line and she's waaaaaay over there in the next county.", "No you\u2019re NOT the AH!!!\nPlease practice blocking all these horrible, hateful people. Then enjoy getting to know your little guy. NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe needs consequences for turning this into a giant shit show all on her own. So she needs to fix it.\n\nFull public apology with an added week of silence for every hateful message, voicemail or call.\n\nPunish her like a toddler. Don't let it get under your skin. Every insult is another week of peace bonding with your baby in solitude.\n\nI mean if she doesn't want to see baby until 2030 that's her business. If not she and her family will learn real fast that you aren't a doormat and shut up.", "NTA\n\nWhat's the expression about opinions? Opinions are like \\_\\_\\_\\_ everyone has one and they all stink. And the corollary; Opinions are like orgasms, mine is more important and I don't care if you have one", "NTA - and glad to see your husband is sticking up for you.", "NTA.  MIL needs to learn consequences.", "NTA. She is texting you calling you an AH and causing drama while you are recovering from birthing her grandson? Fuck that, I\u2019d go no contact and never look back.", "NTA\n\nI'd cut her off now!\n\nAlso, there is a post somewhere about some grandparents who were upset about a similar \"issue\", because in their family, all the men had the same name, for generations.\n\nOP and partner cut them off but then later the grandparents were all \"fake nice\", saying they accept the name and just wanna see the grandson!\n\nWell, turns out that whenever they were alone with grandbaby, they were calling him by their preferred name and introducing him to others with that name!\n\nBoom, back to NC with them!\n\nSo keep an eye out!", "NTA - she is the grandmother...that's it. You are the mother and together with her son, his father, you two are the sole decision makers for him. That's it, that's all. \n\nLet them call you names, you can cut them out of your lives too if they are going to be horrible humans to you guys, especially right after giving birth.\n\nJust remember, you don't owe her (or any of the others) ANYTHING, period!\n\nCongratulations on your new baby, I truly hope that you can enjoy this time with your new bundle of joy without the added stress.", "NTA, and good on your husband for standing up for you. Such a shame his mother had to make the birth of her grandchild all about her. Please, OP, enjoy your little family and congratulations!", "NTA but your husband needs to grow a spine and confront his mother and the rest of the AH family", "NTA and your husband needs to cut her off NOW. Block her and anyone else who messages you to berate you. You just had a baby! You need to focus on recovering and bonding with your baby.", "Stand your ground.  The family sounds nuts.", "NTA- I am so sorry you are going through this right after giving birth.", "NTA- I am so sorry you are going through this right after giving birth.", "NTA. It's your kid, your choice. She sounds toxic.", "NTA. She sounds like a horror show. What a pita", "No your not. The grandmother is over bearing and overstepping boundaries. I am soon to be a new grandmother, as my son and daughter-in-law are expecting their first child, which will be my first grandchild. I had two sons I never got to experience a daughter. I am very thankful that my daughter-in-law wants me to go with her to the doctor and as far as I know, I am going to get to be in the delivery room as well, but I know my boundaries, the names that they have picked out are not names I would have picked out, but this is their child not mine. She needs to learn her boundaries, and if she doesn\u2019t, I would no longer include her in things.", "Yes!  Had to draw this line with my own mother and she crossed. Haven\u2019t seen/heard from her in over ten years and it\u2019s been great!", "This is the only acceptable response. Have your husband send this message. No do-overs, if she doesn't comply with her next response ...go no contact immediately. If she comes to your house, have her trespassed off your property.", "Perfect response. For any moms to be reading this you can tell your nurse who you want or do not want to see you while in labor or afterward. Use them to buffer you from unwanted family or friends.", "Yeahhhh.... This isn't going to happen. MIL runs that family. Barges info the fucking delivery room and no one kicks her out?\n\nYa she runs circles around them", "We took this approach after grandparents wouldn't respect our wishes to not post pics of our daughter on their public social media pages...hasn't happened since.", "Exactly this!! She also needs to tell MIL to tell the family how whatever story she told is a lie and that OP did nothing wrong", "[removed]", "This. OP, send this to your MIL almost word for word. If she responds anything but favorably, block her and the rest of her flying monkeys. Let your husband know. And tell him you want to focus on your new family and stop wasting energy on her drama. He should stop responding to her too.", "Love the submit part! All I can see now is MIL on hands and knees pleading for forgiveness! HAHAHAHA!", "For future reference, you can tell the L&D nurses you want her out and they will extract her and not allow her back. \n\nThese ladies are rock stars and have seen crazy MIL and worse", "Yeah, they need to spend some time on r/JustNoMIL to be prepared for all the crazy ways she could act", "[removed]", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "You ain't lyin!  Lord knows my wife has had to stick up for me with a couple of her siblings who disrespected me in our house earlier in the marriage.  (It was about four years ago and we all get along okay now, but for the first couple of years it was a touchy situation.)  Finally I'd had enough of letting them push me and BIL and I almost came to blows.  My wife runs past me, gets in his face, and tells him flat out he's not going to disrespect HER husband in OUR house, that if I'd pulled that in HIS place he'd toss me out on my ass, and that if he didn't like it don't let the door hit him in the ass on his way out.  He calmed down while I went outside to cool off, and when I came back in he apologized.  Since then we get along well enough.  But you're right.  The In Law dynamic can be VERY complicated.", "Why?", "[removed]", "How did MIL even know OP went into labor and was going to the hospital?  It seems obvious that her husband told MIL and then didn't manage her in any way.  OP is obviously NTA but I'm side eyeing her husband at least a little right now.", ">She'll see he stands with you.\n\nLol, no. She's going to be convinced that OP put him up to that. She's already accusing her of controlling him on the name. Your right though, husband should be the one to stand up.", "[removed]", "you're supporting the MIL here?  what are you saying?", "also hubby might benefit from checking out r/raisedbynarcissists", "You're right.  He clearly is doing his job.  Good on him.", "At the end of the day, he can't control what his mom does and does not do.", "OP shouldn't air hair family's dirty laundry in public. It would make OP look  small and it would reflect poorly on her husband.", "Wow you are immature. Your heart's in the right place but your execution is terrible.", "In a normal family, I'd expect a soon-to-be new father to let his mother know that her grandchild is about to be born (though it's understandable if he doesn't have time to do so). And how was he supposed to \"manage\" her?\n\nThe MIL's behavior (as described) is atrocious, but I don't see any evidence that the husband did anything wrong.", "This was stolen from u/ArtificialMurder's comment.", "There's no controlling the mom. It's saying - if you want access to me and my family, you will be respectful to my wife. If you cannot be respectful, then you will not have access. We are a unit together. Then it's up to the mom to decide how to act.", "But he can operate as gate keeper, and truth teller to his family.", "Yes he can. He can refuse to let her see her grandson until she apologizes to OP and her son, until she tells the whole family she lied and proves she is sincerely sorry and won\u2019t start her BS up again.", "MIL already did. She's getting her flying monkeys to say awful things about OP. If OP gets her side of the story out, that's not airing dirty laundry. That's self-defense.", "If MIL felt it was okay to text OP about this, then it's already out in the world. It would just be made even more public.\n\nGotta think about what you say before you say it, isn't that something her generation was taught?", "Ok, I have to disagree in a small portion. One not like any of the family members will see this. And she gave out no names just ages. I am sure there are a lot of entitled MILs trying to boss their DILs around. It's not a unique dynamic.  BTW OP NTA.", "He absolutely should have told her to leave the moment she showed up", "The way he's supposed to manage her is \"Mom, we'll let you know once Timmy is born, but it'll be just me and Wife in the hospital room.\" Or at the very least \"Mom, Wife is literally giving birth as we speak; shut up about feeding schedules as we don't need to talk about that now.\"", "He could have managed her by making her leave before it reached the point OP was yelling at her (how about when she asked if she could legally change the name-that would be a good time for DH to step up)", "I don't get how many people are letting their parents or inlaws take part in decisions regarding their babies!\n\nMy partner and I made our own decisions and no one else from outside of us two tried to coerce us into doing something else for the baby! We even only had her parents over (from our country) after two months. \n\nThey're super nice but we still had to tell them what was what, because they came too strong onto the kid (obviously, first grandkid), and they listened and acquiesced! \n\nSure, they offer some advice or something and we take it or we don't, but there is no way that they think they can take over parenting over our son!\n\nSo, why are there so many posts about people not standing up for themselves against pushy parents or inlaws, damn!", "Either the moment she showed up or the moment she started trying to change the baby's name. But the OP herself told the MIL to leave (we don't know after how long). We don't really know what the husband said in the meantime.\n\nThe comment I replied to implied that the husband shouldn't have let the MIL know that the OP was going to the hospital. In retrospect, hiding that information might have been a good idea, but perhaps the MIL's behavior was unexpected.", ">My MIL is very opinionated about everything. She has been giving us her opinion on everything for our son.\n\nGiven that info from the OP in the post, it was not unexpected. And the fact that she was there bitching about the name means she *stayed throughout OP's labor which she wanted to do with just her husband.*"]}
