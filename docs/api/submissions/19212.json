Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.  \nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.  \nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.  \nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?  \nBallast!  \nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.  \nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .  \nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.  \nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.  \nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!  \nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.  \nYou know what would be easier?

With people like your MIL, you absolutely need to set strong boundaries right out of the gate, letting her know in no uncertain terms that *you* are the parents, and she will either respect the rules and boundaries you put in place for your son, or she will not be part of his life.\n\nMILs like that can and will attempt to take over parenting their grandchild if allowed. They will gladly make every decision about your son's life and take all practical power away from you. The good news is that it sounds like your husband is with you on this, and is willing to stand up to his mom / extended family as needed. That makes things much simpler for you vs. having a husband who acts as an extension of his mother in her quest for more control.\n\nI would recommend letting him be the one to convey these boundaries to his mother as much as possible so she gets the message that he stands with you. She needs to understand, and understand well, that this new little baby is not hers to control. She already had her turn at raising kids. Now it's her grown son's turn, along with you, to raise *your* son the way you both see fit. \n\nHang in there! Setting boundaries now will save lots of drama/heartache later! Sometimes it takes a temporary cutting of ties to teach people like your MIL that they do not have a right to be in either your or your son's life. In some cases, cutting those ties once, then restoring them later on with appropriate conditions/warnings in place, is all it takes to get that message across. Hopefully you won't have to resort to that, but if you do, know that it's well within your rights, and you're doing what is best for your son.", "NTA.
