There are four couples; 8 people. Four years ago one couple moved out of state.\n\nLast month, my out-of-state friend asked me to plan a get-together while they\u2019re in town. I brought it to the group & we picked a restaurant. I made reservations for 10 because sometimes someone brings an extra.\n\nOne friend said, \"It can be our anniversary dinner!\"\n\n4 - 5 times we've celebrated our anniversaries together although the real dates are far apart, but I was never aware of a rule that others can't attend. I didn\u2019t object, but the anniversary aspect of our plans was not on my radar; it wasn't pertinent - so I thought.\n\nLater, I invited my daughter (DD, 23 y.o.) to dinner and texted the group, \u201cDD is coming, 1 spot still open!\u201d\n\nBut 2\u00bd hours before dinner, a different friend PM\u2019d me, saying I must uninvite DD from our plans because they had been hoping to have dinner with the 'adults'. This friend often brings (sometimes all 3 of) her adult kids.\n\nI refused to uninvite DD. She persisted.\n\nI tried to explain that DD has agoraphobia; it\u2019s not easy for her to agree to leave the house. There was no way in hell I could rescind her invitation 2\u00bd hours beforehand. This friend has known for weeks that the reservation was for 10.\n\nThings I didn't have a chance to say because she hung up on me:\n\nIn fact the reason I reserved 10 spots is I was hoping this friend in particular would bring her daughter, too.\n\nAlso, I am not so heartless as to uninvite DD 2\u00bd hours before dinner, then go without her. Complying would have forced hubby and me out of the plans I HAD MADE for our other friend.\n\n\\--\n\nMe: \"DD has agoraphobia and it wasn\u2019t easy for her to say yes. She has been having a hard time lately; she would be devastated if I uninvited her now.\"\n\nHer: \"So it's all about DD.\"\n\nMe: \"I can count on 1 hand the number of times DD has been to dinner with the group.\"\n\nHer: \"This was supposed to be our traditional anniversary dinner.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, I didn't think of it as an anniversary dinner. If you had a problem with plans for 10, why didn't you say something weeks ago? I would have changed it if you had said something sooner.\"\n\nHer, \"I was waiting to see what everybody else would do.\"\n\nMe (exact words): \"I am not uninviting DD and you better not say one effing word about this to her at dinner tonight, it would destroy her.\"\n\nHer: \"I can see you're getting upset, so I'm hanging up now. This is me, hanging up.\"\n\nThey blew off dinner, giving no explanation. It has been 7 days. I'm not gossiping with the group about this; IDK if she might have PM\u2019d others since.\n\nFor my part, I raised my voice and dropped the f-bomb, so I apologized for that. Twice by text and again by voice mail  - crickets.\n\nI feel blindsided by such an epic blow-out, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking \"It doesn't add up\", you're right. I'm still reeling in total shock from how much it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688672505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sjj5n/aita_for_not_uninviting_my_daughter_from_a_dinner/", "score": 346, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What others have said, but also: I think at some point in life, we\u2019ve all been invited to a gathering where the invited group is not the exact set of people we expected. That still does not give a person the right to 1) ask for someone to be uninvited and 2) throw a fit when it doesn\u2019t happen.

Nah I wouldn\u2019t lose any sleep over her", "It seems so, but honestly I've been wracking my brain to figure out what precipitated this and I can't think of a single thing I or my daughter did. Also to add, my daughter is sweet, a little timid, overall pleasant person, and a decent conversationalist - on the rare occasion she goes out at all. She's never had any conflict with the group that I'm aware of. And neither have I.\n\nHubby said a few months ago that he felt something was off between him and the friend's husband (one of his closest friends) but couldn't put his finger on it, and it's been eating him up. But when he asked the other husband about it a couple of months ago, he said all was ok.\n\nThe AH friend has been exhibiting progressively worse and worse narcissistic traits over the past 20 years, mostly toward her own daughters (with whom she is often at odds), her neighbors (whom she despises), her own husband, and random other people (co-workers, relatives, etc.) who she perceives \"did her wrong\". The rest of us usually shift uncomfortably in our seats while she tells us how she put this or that person in their place. Because we all know what the problem is, but no one will say anything.

No one would even know there is a problem. There have never been any issues before or drama between DH, DD, or myself and the group.", "In fact, the out-of-town friend invited her (adult) niece, but she couldn't make it.

I'm 56, she's a couple of years older.  \nYou know, I thought about that and this is how I'm coming to peace with  what happened. Now that I think about it, one time I tried to share with her how anguishing it is to watch your adult child have an anxiety attack, her response was to trivialize DD's (diagnosed) medical condition. In other conversation I have heard her imply that people with crippling anxiety are just manipulative and lazy, and if it was her kid she would have thrown her out on her behind, stuff like that. So I long ago stopped mentioning these struggles to her. If she was a friend she would have empathy, a kind word, or maybe even offer to help me find resources and hope for my daughter. But that has never happened. Only hard-heartedness.\n\nIt seems she was never really my friend, and I kinda already knew that. But this is still devastating. I think it will break up the group.\n\nNo matter. We are going out of state to visit our friends there next month. The other good friend lives a few blocks away and we see each other often enough. Maybe our group dinners, vacations, and epic Disneyland trips are over. But the friendships ( at least, the real ones) are not.", "Maybe she wanted to bring her kids?", "NTA There's more going on here than she's said, or else she hates your daughter something fierce.", "I have to add, we intentionally scheduled a late reservation specifically to accommodate their work schedule. \n\nWhen we first arrived, I explained to the group that the friend and I had had an argument (no further details) and I hoped it wasn't going to affect the dinner. We were all going to wait to order until they showed up. But the designated arrival time came and went and it is not like them to be late, so people were starting to worry. One of the ladies texted her, \"Are you guys almost here?\" and received back, \"We made other plans tonight.\" \n\nSo they were going to just not show up and not tell anyone. I couldn't possibly say anything about the details of why they weren't there, thus bad-mouthing them to the group, and then DD would have known why they hadn't come. Because how could I tell her that? Again it would have devastated her to know that they refused to come to dinner because she was there. WTAF? She has literally never had any conflict with them. It was VERY AWFUL.\n\nAt one point I went to the bathroom and cried.", "She didn't say that she was waiting for someone to object specifically to DD. She was (ostensibly) hoping that no one would invite anyone else so it could just be the core group of eight people, not ten.\n\nBut she never said, \"It was supposed to be just the core group, and if it isn't we aren't coming\" -- until 2 1/2 hours before dinner. I still hoped, until it was time to order, that they would show up. I just figured, a sane, rational person shrugs and goes anyway to honor their out-of-town friends, even if you didn't get your way as regards the number of invitees. I was genuinely disappointed that they didn't come. I would have wanted to get past this, keep a short account, and let it be water under the bridge.", "I felt that way too. Saying, \"DH and I needed some time for just the two of us\" would have been fine and everyone would have had sympathy and understanding because we have all been there.\n\nMaking it about DD was really, really awful. Put me in an impossible spot.", "This occurred to me. Maybe she was wondering why I didn't reserve a table for 11. Then all 3 of her daughters could have come. They didn't have space for 11 or I might have done. It's a small restaurant.", "I just apologized to the other ladies privately, saying that I didn't mean to bring any drama into the group, explained what happened without making anyone into the devil,  and adding that I hope I didn't ruin dinner too badly. One friend said she was going to stay neutral (which I guess I understand, I would never be juvenile enough to expect others to shun the AH) and the other said, \"You did nothing wrong, she always brings her kids. When you made the reservation for 10, I assumed it was so she could bring HER kids, because she always does. SHE made it all about HER. I will tell her that if she brings it up.\" \n\nA lot of the events are at the AH's home, so IDK if she will just leave us out in the future; I guess we can wait and see. Sheesh, it's been sooo many years since I had a petty \"friend\" deliberately leaving me out of plans!  I hoped to never go back to that again. I just don't get adults acting like they're in Junior High. Also the husbands are still best friends and they are GREAT together. It don't think I will exclude anyone if I make plans in the future. I might have to roll over in the name of peace. It sticks in my craw.", "I am pretty sure they are having struggles in their marriage. Maybe they wanted to talk about that at dinner.

Don't feel bad for not uninviting your daughter.", "OP if she is waiting to see what others would do, bc she didn't want the group to be more than 8, then it's also an implication that she hoped someone else would say something first.", "She sounds a lot like a \"rules for thee and not for me\" type. At least on this topic.\n\nIt's sort of telling that one of your other friends thought that the extra seats on the reservation where because the complainer was already planning to bring her kids.\n\nIt also makes me wonder if the blow-up was because said friend was planning to bring two of her kids, and wanted your daughter's seat. Which would have been a total jerk move. Though, if that was the plan, I'm sure she'd have had a justification as to why her kids didn't count.", "I agree that we all contributed to allowing it on an ongoing basis, I guess because it was never one of us, and now the chickens have come home to roost.\n\nAnother problem lies in the fact that in addition to our close friend group, we also have an extended group of long-term friends, some 50+ people.

(You can do that without saying anything about the dinner). Is there some backstory here you might be discounting (examples: if your daughter was formally friends with hers, if she has a past history with someone who used anxiety to manipulate things, if she was pregnant and lost a child around the time you gave birth to your daughter, if previous gatherings were even slightly disrupted by your daughter\u2019s needs, if she disagrees with your parenting approach, if your daughter saw her do something inappropriate, if her husband might have expressed attraction to your daughter, if your daughter is a member of a group she dislikes. etc.)? \n\nI\u2019m not saying any of the above would excuse her poor behavior.

No, I read it right the first time.  The only one who isn't an adult is the ex-friend.  NTA.", "You are correct. I will not be her friend going forward. However, we will see each other in our wider social circle so I will have to learn a new skill called \"grey rock\".", "She definitely disagrees with my parenting approach. She has said she thinks anxiety is a bunch of bs and people use it to manipulate others. She said she thought I was being manipulated, and that if her daughter had been unable to leave her room or keep a job, she'd be out on her ass. But it was some three years ago that she said this and it has never come up again.\n\nMy daughter has REAL, DIAGNOSED medical conditions and is in treatment for them.

She's a former EMT though, she can't possibly believe that, can she?\n\nShe DID put her OWN daughter out on her ass in her early 20's and was estranged from her for a while because - this is what she told the group - she felt the daughter's boyfriend was disrespectful and didn't have enough of a work ethic. Her response to anyone's suffering is, \"Suck it up, buttercup.\" or, \"I have it so much worse than you.\" She's a narcissist.\n\nThis friend has only seen my daughter maybe 10 times in as many years. It's not as if they have much opportunity for interaction.\n\nI wonder if she is jealous because my daughter and I have a good relationship she and her daughters - don't.", "NTA.

We always cut her some slack and of course as a first responder she has our ultimate respect. So there's that. But she doesn't get to abuse my daughter. Ain't happening.", "I know nurse with a masters degree who doesn't believe in mental illness. She thinks they are real but it's controllable and people shouldn't be on medication for it long term.

It blows my mind that someone in Healthcare can think that way. I told her it was the same as saying a diabetic should be able to 'will' themselves to produce and process insulin better and she argued it wasn't the same.", "Yes, that's why I apologized. I thought about my part and what I did \"wrong\" and that was it. Raising my voice and swearing. So I did what I needed to do.

Great at first, but through the years was slowly becoming more self-absorbed and hard to communicate with in a rational adult manner. You ignore it because they're your friend and try to make it work. However, if they weren't your friend, you realize you wouldn't allow yourself to be treated like that for one second. We're not friends anymore because of a similar \"you've always been like this, but you've crossed the line this time\" moment.\n\nStrange how it works.

It's the 2 days after I feel like talking to anyone is not possible that is the real impact and no one sees that.", "A basic guide to the Grey Rock Method. Your EX friend thrives on drama so at some point she is going to try to provoke you into reacting negatively, likely so she can DARVO and play the victim. **So don\u2019t give her the reaction she\u2019s looking for**. Your goal is to make needling at you so boring and unrewarding that he gives up. \n\nEvery time she says something to start drama/a fight don\u2019t react. Don\u2019t look upset, don\u2019t sound upset, don\u2019t call her out. Act normal, like what she said was some innocuous comment. Keep your replies to something non-committal like \u201chmm\u201d, \u201cok\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d, \u201ccool\u201d, \u201chuh\u201d, \u201cnoted\u201d, \u201cwow\u201d, \u201cneat\u201d, etc then immediately change the subject to something bland or something you know they\u2019ll always talk about when asked.  As soon as you can come up with an excuse to end the conversation and walk away. You want your interactions to be brief and boring. \n\n\u201cYou ruined our anniversary dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoted. Did you see that story on the news about the tornado. Crazy, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour daughter is never gonna improve if you keep babying her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk. Are you going to Bill\u2019s retirement party this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you like being alone, because nobody\u2019s going to want to hang out with selfish anniversary-ruiners like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool. Did you ever find that hard drive you were looking for?\u201d\n\nIf she just won\u2019t stop trying to provoke you then end the conversation and leave: \u201cI just remembered I have to do [chore/errand/go to the bathroom/talk to ABC], bye.\u201d Then walk away/hang up. \n\nIf she directly asks you why you aren\u2019t reacting to her comments: \u201cI have nothing to say about that/ I have no opinions on that. Anyways, [Immediately change subject]\u201d\n\nThe key here is you can *never* react to her comments, because if you do she will double down in the future to provoke you. Make needling you into a worthless and boring effort on her part, and she should hopefully give up on it.", "\"gotta go, hubby just told me the wall is all done, we're going to watch it dry together\"."]}
