It's easier to get older children, but you run the risk of them having psychological and behavioral issues from growing up in the system. And don't get me started on how biased the system is towards gay couples that want to adopt.  That's why a lot of people adopt from out of the country. There is however a problem with adopting from Eastern European countries because there heavy drug use among women that put their kids in the system and a lot have developmental delays and are born addicted to drugs, which you can't really tell until their older, so it's a roll of the die. It's a popular place to adopt because many families want 'white babies'.\n\nProbably the safest bet is adopting from East Asia, where a lot of kids born to single women (a big no no) are put up for adoption. For a long time it was China mostly because of the one child policy, but now I think people adopt largely from Korea.\n\nI love the idea of adoption, but it's so difficult and often time expensive.

They were talking about reducing but she talked them  into keeping both because it was their last chance to have another child since they burnt through any dime they had for this. \n\nMaybe try to look into what you're talking about before you claim to know what it's really about without any experience in it.
