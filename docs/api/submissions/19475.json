Why did he and his wife contract with a surrogate they don\u2019t trust?

I know that there possibly exist surrogacy that's actually good, but such a large part of it is just buying women's bodies (edit: not to mention, buying children), and it is so gross and the way people seem to handwave it away is chilling.", "I feel the same. Not to mention that the brother and partner are really wealthy and the surrogate is clearly from a more deprived \u201cunsafe area\u201d with a possibly \u201cfilthy\u201d house. The whole thing stinks of buying desperate women\u2019s bodies.", "It\u2019s modern day slavery. Yes, she is getting paid for it, but if the brother was really interested in an equitable surrogacy, he would do this within his country, or pay the equivalent to her, rather than exploiting a 3rd world person and risking her health. Pregnancy is one of the most dangerous things any woman will do, and to do it for money is only done in desperation. In the UK, it is illegal to pay for it so it is volunteer only, which isn\u2019t exploitation free (many of these women have mental health issues IMHO) but at least it is more equitable. However, even then, very few are rich and well educated and most come from more deprived backgrounds.", "Oh yes.", "Almost everyone who uses a surrogate is preying on deep financial insecurity and it's gross. So many kids are already here, desperate to be adopted, but you need a purebred. Surrogacy is immoral.", "You're not the only one.

Never mind the fact that having a surrogate in another country screams 50 shades of shady-as-fuck. But, like, he\u2019s never even been to her house? Mind you, I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s appropriate/safe for the woman for a parent to visit their surrogate\u2019s house.

If medical needs are met and the woman gets paid whatever has been agreed on it\u2019s really no one\u2019s business but the people involved.  \n\nIt may seem off putting but it can offer someone the chance to earn significant money when they otherwise might not be able to earn it through traditional work.", "It only takes the top comment's verdict anyway", "I don't know if UK footballers retire with the injuries of American footballers, but our version takes a huge toll on the body. Would you expect someone to do that for free?\n\nProfessional surrogacy firms in the US hire women who have had at least one child, screen them psychologically, pay all medical expenses, and pay a fee that was around $50K ten years ago. \n\nI wouldn't give up rights to my body for less.", "No, women in the UK just get paid under the table, which typically means less compensation or regulations.

Calling this slavery is ridiculous compared to truely existing modern slavery...", "It\u2019s not about undervaluing the surrogacy, it\u2019s about taking out the monetary incentive. So that people who are acting as surrogates are not doing it for the money or at risk of doing it out of desperation. All reasonable expenses are paid.", "Given the horrific shit pregnancy can do to a woman, hazard pay seems appropriate", "But then it becomes a case of \"is the hazard pay making this dangerous undertaking a career choice?\"\n\nSurrogacy for cases like infertility, or giving gay loved ones an opportunity of parenthood where at least one of the men has shared DNA in the child, or allowing a woman who has high risk of dying in labour to still raise a child is wonderful and amazing \n\nSurrogacy of \"I don't wanna be fat\" or \"I don't want to take maternity leave and have to recover after birth\" or \"designer baby\" shopping where the family wants to lower the odds of their child being short, or having a big nose or whatever is reprehensible \n\nThe 1st ones - you'll find a hell of a lot of women willing to do that in exchange for no financial profit (as said in the UK a reasonable financial stipend for pregnancy related costs is totally acceptable, but the surrogate still has to make a living independently).\n\nThe second ones - you're not going to find women willing to do that for a bit of extra money to fund more calories and maternity clothes...", "I would agree but it then becomes an incentive to do something which clearly can be hazardous"]}
