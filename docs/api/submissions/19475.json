I earn more here, with my Mexican job. And yes, I did say that I know that I\u2019m a very lucky person, not only in my country, but in every country, and I talk from experience, I have friends from absolutely every social status and even my ex boss that was deported from New Jersey, and now lives in Puebla, always says it\u2019s the best thing that happened to him because he has a better life here. I\u2019m sorry your experience is different, so different than mine, but no one experience is the same ever, I hope things get better for you and your family.
