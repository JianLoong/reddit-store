On our 2nd date he shared that he had a recent positive test for cancer. And, I was warned by Chris, and his friends that his parents were horrible people. His mother meets all the criteria for a sociopath, dad is a narcissist. They treat their adult children horribly, use them to meet their emotional needs while offering nothing but manipulation and criticism. All the while using money to ensure loyalty and proximity. Add their toxic individualistic values, and they truly are some of the meanest, most selfish people I have met.\n\nDespite this, I fell in love with Chris, partnered up. We had an amazing connection, and I felt it would be worth any pain to share even a short time with him. I tried a lot in the beginning with the parents to have a good relationship with them. This was never reciprocated. I was disrespected, and obviously excluded from all family references, holidays, family photos, etc. So, Chris and I focused on our life together.\n\nChris was looking at a chance to beat this disease. There was a window where with proper treatments, less stress/more rest he could have created a window of remission. Yet his parents refused to help, even when in the midst of debilitating treatments. They kept insisting \u2018everyone dies, and it will be better for you to have something to do\u2019 and made it clear they disrespected his choice to pursue a dream- even if he might have a chance at a bit longer life. As a result, I singlehandedly cared for him while burning through my retirement. I also worked myself into chronic illness that has left me with chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. I have given a lot.\n\nWe didn't make it a a couple (the stress broke us) but we are still best friends. I'm here for him. Chris is now staying in an empty apt his uncle owns, while I and his sister take care of him 24/7 - he doesn\u2019t have much time left. I am sleeping in my van as short term rentals are out of my budget at this point. His family has made it clear they won't be helping out with this care in any way. I don't agree and have been contributing as much as I am able - its just too much for one person - and he's their son, too!\n\nHis mother did agree that she would pay for whatever funeral arrangements Chris would liked. Yesterday we learned that this limited to 25% less than needed for a basic funeral. As a result she won't pay for his gravestone - or a reception- and they conveyed to me that they expect me to pay for the gravestone.  \n\nGiven my significant investment already (in comparison to her), I replied that \"we would have an unmarked grave until they can scrape up some cash for a headstone\". This feels petty, and I feel I have to say no, for my own sake. \n\nI think I could be the asshole here for not covering the gravestone marker - leaving Chris with a less than ideal memorial and causing more conflict in the family?\n\nAITA for telling my ex mother n law that I won't pay for my ex's headstone?", "created_utc": 1669738576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7yc8h/aita_for_telling_my_mother_n_law_i_wont_pay_for/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Explained the situation, and My Guys found a GORGEOUS 100-year-old Syrian box, inlaid with camel bone, ebony, and mother-of-pearl. Dad's one regret was never making it to Syria. Well, thanks to My Guys, we brought Syria to him \u2764\ufe0f It meant something. And it was thousands less than a casket. Guy sold it at a significant loss. Would have given it to me, but I wouldn't let him (it was a reverse haggle. Told him my dad would smack me for just taking it).\n\nMy Gramma's funeral was a RAGING success.

Played her music, sat on her bed with her and on the windowsills, on chairs we brought in....her last words were what a LOVEly party! \u2764\ufe0f And then she went to sleep. \n\nSounds to me from the snapshot of your lives that the little things are the important ones. Don't worry about the headstone. Do something meaningful to him. Add a headstone later if he wants it.", "NTA. You're helping Chris now. The gravestone is for those who remain.

Unfortunately, her mental decline lead to her life insurance premiums not being paid so they had her cremated (which she wanted anyway) and had a nice memorial on her birthday.\n\nDad: Didn't want a funeral or memorial, ***nothing***.
