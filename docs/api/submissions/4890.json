But now you're going to need to go to bed sooner to get up in time for the bus so he's going to need to move back home so he doesn't disrupt the new routine that you need to get used to. Free transportation was a small price to pay for free room and board but some people think the world owes them everything", "That's a parasite, not a boyfriend.\n\nNTA", "Every single day remind him how much he owes for half the bills.  He isn't a responsible person and even a kind one to let you pay all the bills and then insist you buy a bus pass. \n\nSadly, getting him out maybe harder than you expect since you never required him to pay half the rent and will have to pay out good money to evict him. \n\nBest to text him daily telling how much the rent and other bills are for proof.  When he doesn't pay then say it is too expensive to support him and you need to focus on getting your life in order including your finances.  The fact that he has not been voluntarily giving you money is a major red flag. \n\n You need to realize that he does not love or care for you.  You are a convenience of sex and  a free place to live.  Sooner you realize this the better.   You are now inconveniencing him and he won't tolerate it, yet you are expected to make all kinds of sacrifices for him. \n\n   It will always be like this and you are better off solo. \n\n Look up the laws and give him the legal requirement to move out. Or say him living there is against you lease and you don't wont to end up homeless because of him.   If he wants to pay half then insist that he be put on the lease so that he is legally responsible too.", ">he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated for driving me to work and picking me up through rain or shine and never once has he asked me to ask my parents (that live 20 minutes away the opposite direction of my work and home) for a ride.\n\nWTF. He contributes nothing to the house snd he feels unappreciated? NTA and toss him out. Doesn't look like he's worth much anyways.", "NTA, but no dick is so good that they don't have to pay half of the bills.", "Perfectly said", "\n\nAnd the correct response should be \"And I feel unappreciated when I pay the rent or utility bills yet again with no help or kudos from you!\"\n\nIf he was paying his part, you'd have money to get the car fixed in a timely manner!\n\nNTA\n\nWhy do you respect yourself so little that you let this man take advantage of you?", "NTA, for being upset, but take a good look at the situation."]}
