Ok. \n\nRecently my car broke and he has been needing to drive me to and from work (again, I pay all the bills). He works 45 minutes away while I work 20 minutes away driving.

He is encouraging I buy a monthly bus pass now. \n\nI am angry that he\u2019s even entertaining the idea.

Moving in together should be discussed as a step in the relationship and establishing a reasonable pay balance is a big step a couple needs to discuss and work out.\n\nYou've created resentment in not demanding pay upfront then hoping he balances it out by doing favors later which he doesn't want to do because he has a sweet deal so far doing nothing.\n\nIs the driving to work temporary (until the car is fixed or you buy a new one soon) or your idea for the foreseeable future?

Good lord, how does the man remember to take a shit?  This is not your person.  Read that again.  He is not on your team.

But YTA for letting him mooch off you. You two needed to have a conversation about moving in together before it happened. Everything should be split 50/50 or comparible and chores should be split equally. But now it's a little late because he's there and comfortable using you for a free place to live. You need to sit down with him and have a brutally honest convo about how this living situation is not working and he either needs to start paying for things equally or has 30 days to get out. One year together is not long enough to really know what someone is like 100% of the time and it seems like he sucks and using you as a doormat. If he wants a suger mama then he needs to find on who is willing. And maybe in the future don't let someone just move in without a serious convo about it first because it is a huge change to any relationship. By rule of thumb I never even think about moving in with someone until after a year.
