He isn't a responsible person and even a kind one to let you pay all the bills and then insist you buy a bus pass. \n\nSadly, getting him out maybe harder than you expect since you never required him to pay half the rent and will have to pay out good money to evict him. \n\nBest to text him daily telling how much the rent and other bills are for proof.  When he doesn't pay then say it is too expensive to support him and you need to focus on getting your life in order including your finances.  The fact that he has not been voluntarily giving you money is a major red flag. \n\n You need to realize that he does not love or care for you.  You are a convenience of sex and  a free place to live.  Sooner you realize this the better.   You are now inconveniencing him and he won't tolerate it, yet you are expected to make all kinds of sacrifices for him. \n\n   It will always be like this and you are better off solo. \n\n Look up the laws and give him the legal requirement to move out. Or say him living there is against you lease and you don't wont to end up homeless because of him.

He is encouraging I buy a monthly bus pass now.\n\nNTA\n\nI suggest telling him that unfortunately after paying rent, bills and food for 2 people you do not have the fu ds for a but pass but if he starts contributing his fair share you would be more than happy to buy it.\n\nOr tell him that since you've never experienced appreciation for paying all of the rent, bills and food for 2 people so you are unsure of how to show your own for him driving you to your job which allows tou all those purchases and current standard of living.\n\nOP, he's a mooch! Where did he live before he started squatting with you? If he rented, then how did he remember to pay his own bills and rent? And even if he lived with his parents prior, he is still maintaining his car, which shows he is certainly capable of remembering to make regular payments on things involving his car without anyone having to remind him.\n\nBe honest with yourself. Maybe you are fine with him living with you, but are you really fine with the financial side of it? This isn't even weaponised incompetence or learnt helplessness (which he is also using and also not good!), he is straight up using you!\n\nEdit to add: he blames the calendar for forgetting?

The fact that he said he forgets due dates is a huge red flag. Okay, you forget due dates, but you can still send the money even if it's late. That doesn't even make sense. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results.
