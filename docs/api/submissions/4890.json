Then one day he never left and I was ok with that. He lives with me.  I\u2019ve asked him to help with rent and utilities multiple times but aside from paying $50 for my internet one month and buying me food he has not paid anything else. He always blames it on forgetting the due dates and promises money on the next paycheck as long as I remind him. Ok. \n\nRecently my car broke and he has been needing to drive me to and from work (again, I pay all the bills). He works 45 minutes away while I work 20 minutes away driving. He got upset that I asked for coffee one morning and said we needed to wake up earlier if we wanted that because he\u2019s always late to work even though we were early that morning. \n\nIt made me upset because we were early. So I left the car without saying \u201cI love you.\u201d And he later texted me to let me know that he doesn\u2019t feel appreciated for driving me to work and picking me up through rain or shine and never once has he asked me to ask my parents (that live 20 minutes away the opposite direction of my work and home) for a ride. He is encouraging I buy a monthly bus pass now. \n\nI am angry that he\u2019s even entertaining the idea. Not because I\u2019d be taking the bus, I\u2019ve done it plenty with my parents when I was younger, but because we leave for work at 7:30a and it\u2019s barely above freezing outside and it\u2019s a very rainy state.

He weedled his way into your apt and now you are footing the bill to support him. If you weren't sinking so much of your income paying for his share of expenses, you'd be able to fix your car.

Moving in together should be discussed as a step in the relationship and establishing a reasonable pay balance is a big step a couple needs to discuss and work out.\n\nYou've created resentment in not demanding pay upfront then hoping he balances it out by doing favors later which he doesn't want to do because he has a sweet deal so far doing nothing.\n\nIs the driving to work temporary (until the car is fixed or you buy a new one soon) or your idea for the foreseeable future? It seems like a lot to expect rides from now on without really discussing it.

He only cares about himself and he is taking advantage of you.  Figure out how much he owes you, tell him it's due by the end of the month or he needs to move out.

Get him the eff out! I know it's not easy, but he is using you HARD! my daughter went thru the same thing, and she wouldn't listen until he finally went ham on her for bugging him about rent and shit. He went to jail, thank God, and she finally moved on and found a dude who is actually a decent human.\n\nPoint is, everyone told her, and she did nothing. You will most likely do the same cuz he's a narcissist and makes you feel like everything is your fault. But it's not! Put on your big-girl pants and kick him to the curb, even if you have to take the bus! It'll be worth it.", "NTA. He\u2019s using you. He wants to be appreciated for giving you a ride while he lives in your house for free? Gtfo.", "OMG - are you seriously allowing him to use you like this?  I mean, you are basically supporting him, and your upset now because he is gaslighting you?  I would have been upset the first month he didn't pitch it and help pay bills (instead of accepting that lame \"oh I forgot the due date\" crap and then you have to be responsible to \"remind\" him?  Good lord, how does the man remember to take a shit?  This is not your person.  Read that again.  He is not on your team.  He is using you and trying to make it out that you're the bad guy - he doesn't feel appreciated?  Seriously?  You've got this on your own - kick this dude to the curb ASAP!

With all the stuff you have to do for him he should be offering to help you out more when he can.\n\nOn another note, you both need to have a talk about bills, finances, and expectations.", "I think it's important you see that he sounds like a toxic jerk and you need out of that relationship. But you sound kinda toxic too. It's petty not to say I love you and you could've asked your parents, not waited on him.\nI think you're both the AH", "ESH. Taking the bus rather than being chauffeured by someone when your car is broken down is pretty reasonable.\n\nBUT he doesn't actually sound reasonable.

Him driving you is not a long term solution. \n\n\nYes he is taking advantage of you. But you got yourself into this by him never leaving.  That's on you. The car situation would annoy me too.
