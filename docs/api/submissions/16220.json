Sounds like your moms playing mind games. It\u2019s obvious that they mean a lot to both your son and your brother. A 14 year old wouldn\u2019t put up stuff all over their walls that they don\u2019t want up. Sounds like she was stirring the pot purposefully to try to get a reaction from you so that she could then come in and \u201csave the day\u201d by letting you stay.

There was no good reason for her to throw those drawings out, and she can\u2019t justify it either.\n\nAlso, your mom doesn\u2019t get an award for being a decent parent when your dad wanted to throw you out.

I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t receive the support you needed (and still need) when you got pregnant at such a young age. That\u2019s a scary and uncertain time and your parents only made it harder on you. I\u2019ll never understand the parental urge to kick out your kid when they get pregnant. Like\u2026 adults who use every precaution can still have an oops, so why are judging teens, who have all the hormones but underdeveloped brains when something like that happens. If your teen decides to keep the baby, then it\u2019s the parents job to help them navigate this curveball from life. Not to make them feel *even worse* when they\u2019re likely already terrified, stressed, uncertain and overwhelmed. Like, providing a roof over their head is literally the bare minimum of parenthood. \n \nObviously you are NTA. Your parents seem to harbour some serious resentment toward your child and could probably benefit from some therapy. If it\u2019s something you all can afford I would suggest that avenue so that you all can unpack your feelings around the big life change of a pregnant teenager etc. I would insist your mom apologize to your son AND brother. It wasn\u2019t her place to take those down and she should acknowledge that she messed up instead of trying to brush it off.", "NTA. Sounds like you hit the nail on the head.", "NTA\n\nThat's awful.

What your parents are doing is pure manipulative bullshit.\n\nYou don't get to do something hateful today and claim it's okay because you did something nice yesterday. That's not how life and relationships work. They're not meant to be so coldly transactional. \n\nYou can and should be grateful to your mother for the good things she has done and still be angry and disappointed when she pulls some petty bullshit like this.\n\nYou said it felt good to call her out. Why do you think that is? Did it feel surprisingly good? Maybe there's a reason for that. I'm guessing if you really think about it you'll spot a pattern of this kind of manipulation and guilt-tripping going back a nice long time.", "NTA your mum seems jealous of the relationship between your brother and your son", "NTA\nWhat your mother did was wrong, and she didn\u2019t do anything to rectify the situation once she realized how upset your son was. She should give them back so that your brother can put them back. It is his room after all, he should be able to decide what are on his walls", "NTA. It sounds like a tough situation all around, but your mother had no right to take the drawings, which were clearly beloved by your brother and son. Your father should not have guilted you by saying what he did- if he and your mother had kicked you out as a minor, they would have been very much in the wrong and he should realize that. That was not your mother being generous, it was her doing the right thing, and it does not give her a free pass to treat you or your son badly in the future. That being said, this is probably a symptom of other, more serious issues in your and your parents relationship. Name calling can only make it worse, regardless of whether or not it is justified. If you have the means, I would suggest doing whatever you can to move towards independence from your parents in the near future. Space may be what all of you need.", "NTA at all.. your mom *knew* she did something to crush her 4 YEAR OLD grandson's feelings that way and had the gall to sit there and comfort him like *she didn't know* what she did? That's *totally* heartless and 2 faced.. what was her end goal there? To let her own 14 year old CHILD take the blame for what she did, while also crushing his feelings as well? That's pretty disgusting of her. And I'm sorry. But anybody who wants to throw out their scared, confused, pregnant 16-year-old CHILD just for being pregnant is not being a good parent, either. Your mom's jealousy of the bond between a 4 year old and his uncle is weird and gross.. and I'm sorry but you can't convince me what she did wasn't out of spite because she was jealous your son's gift got the most attention/excitement from your brother.. BTW your brother sounds like an *amazing* brother and uncle and screw anybody who tries to interfere or damage that bond..", "NTA", "It's hard to call you TA in this situation (especially considering that your mom is so clearly a huge AH), but I've said things in the past that gave me that horrible-yet-satisfying feeling, and if I could go back and do it over, I'd have tried to give the message without the viciousness.\n\nWhen you strike out like that, the focus becomes how you said it rather than the very important thing you were trying to say. It basically gives the AH a way to completely ignore what you wanted them to hear and convince others that you were the only AH in the picture.", "You got alot of support on this for calling her out\n\nBut youre 20, an adult.\n\nWhats the point of losing it on her? Especially considering what your dad said.  \n\nReddit is always fast to support emotional off the rail actions but there was a time we taught people to stay calm and converse first, then go off the rail later", "I'm going against the grain on this one. \n\nYTA. You are 20 years old and living with your child at your parent's home - for free. What your Mom did was wrong. But, you can't go calling people names when you get upset. Speak to her like an adult and explain what upset you. She isn't acting very mature, but you are not either. If you don't like the way she behaves, you can go get another place to live and pay your own way. Your son and your brother are children.

Ever since ive made a permenant rule with my bf before we ever had our daughter. Punishment must fit the crime and INTENTION! SOo if she spills something by mistake then theres no punishment because the intention was for it not to happen the crime is usually she spilt some water like who cares about tht or even if its a staining thing like a strawberry well then ok we clean it together thats the consequence as that fits the crime perfectly.
