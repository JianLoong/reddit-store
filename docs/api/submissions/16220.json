In fact, my son looks up to him and my brother adores him. \n\nMy son made this drawing of him and my brother and gave it to my brother for his birthday.

When we got back, my son ran to my brother\u2019s room to show him something. The door was wide open and the first thing he noticed was that all his drawings were gone. He just began to cry and cry and it took forever to calm him down. He eventually went to sleep.\n \nMy brother came back the next day and when he went to hug my son, he started to cry. My brother was confused so I told him that he saw the empty wall. My brother was still confused so he went to his room and came back really upset.

She was there the night before when my son saw the wall and started crying and she was comforting my son and everything.

Wow your mum has some serious jealousy issues going on there. I really hope she doesn\u2019t cause any damage to the relationship between your brother and your son.", "NTA. Sounds like your moms playing mind games. It\u2019s obvious that they mean a lot to both your son and your brother. A 14 year old wouldn\u2019t put up stuff all over their walls that they don\u2019t want up. Sounds like she was stirring the pot purposefully to try to get a reaction from you so that she could then come in and \u201csave the day\u201d by letting you stay.  So she both caused the issue and she\u2019s the \u201cgood guy\u201d in the situation.", "NTA - You can apologize for calling her a \u201cheartless b*tch\u201d for your own conscience, and if this was a truly out-of-character thing for her to do, but don\u2019t back down on pointing out how what she did was wrong and hurt both her son and grandson immensely. There was no good reason for her to throw those drawings out, and she can\u2019t justify it either.\n\nAlso, your mom doesn\u2019t get an award for being a decent parent when your dad wanted to throw you out. That was quite literally her job.", "NTA - Your mom should be glad you held back.", "NTA! You were correct. Your statement was accurate.", "Honestly both your parents sound awful. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t receive the support you needed (and still need) when you got pregnant at such a young age. That\u2019s a scary and uncertain time and your parents only made it harder on you. I\u2019ll never understand the parental urge to kick out your kid when they get pregnant. Like\u2026 adults who use every precaution can still have an oops, so why are judging teens, who have all the hormones but underdeveloped brains when something like that happens. If your teen decides to keep the baby, then it\u2019s the parents job to help them navigate this curveball from life. Not to make them feel *even worse* when they\u2019re likely already terrified, stressed, uncertain and overwhelmed. Like, providing a roof over their head is literally the bare minimum of parenthood. \n \nObviously you are NTA. Your parents seem to harbour some serious resentment toward your child and could probably benefit from some therapy. If it\u2019s something you all can afford I would suggest that avenue so that you all can unpack your feelings around the big life change of a pregnant teenager etc. I would insist your mom apologize to your son AND brother. It wasn\u2019t her place to take those down and she should acknowledge that she messed up instead of trying to brush it off.", "NTA. Sounds like you hit the nail on the head.", "NTA\n\nThat's awful. She deliberately broke her grandson's and son's heart. (To what end? To punish you for keeping and raising yours?).", "Nta my mum used to pull shit like this ALL THE TIME \nHeres her multi step way of doing things\n\nStep 1: Do something incredibly cruel like throw away a whole walls worth of drawings\n\nStep 2: pretend she didnt mean anything by it and try to comfort us while knowing full well she did it on purpose.\n\nStep 3: when one of my 4 siblings enevitably finds out what she did she gets cussed for messing with our child minds like tht\n\nStep 4: Throw a tantrum and claim everyone is being mean for no reason\n\nStep 5: threaten to kick us out to our dad so he is convinced this has to happen now and when he actually goes to do it change his mind so she seems like the hero who kept everyone from being homeless.\n\nStep 6: when everyone obviously tells her to shove it cause no one cares if they live there or not have dad yell them into submission again.\n\n\nWhat u have goin on here is textbook my friend keep sticking up for ure kid and dont ever let ure mum trick u into thinking she is the good guy. Cause the moment u let her win like that BAM suddenly shes bullied ure kid for 5 years and dad hid it from u nd uve got expensive therapy and a kid who doesnt trust anyone anymore. Dont let it happen dont let her win keep ure son and ure brother on the right path (sounds like ure bro needs no help tho what a fantastic human being!! )and keep defending the moral truth she fucked up and she found out now shes tryna back step DO NOT LET HER!", "NTA your mother has some issues and I think the fact that you're the 'mom' now and she's actually jealous of you and the relationship you and your son have with your brother. Very sad", ">My dad confronted me later and yelled at me for what I said. He said that regardless of what she did, she\u2019s my mom and when he wanted to kick me out, mom\u2019s the one who convinced him to let me and my baby stay. AITA? I feel guilty now.\n\nNTA. What your parents are doing is pure manipulative bullshit.\n\nYou don't get to do something hateful today and claim it's okay because you did something nice yesterday. That's not how life and relationships work. They're not meant to be so coldly transactional. \n\nYou can and should be grateful to your mother for the good things she has done and still be angry and disappointed when she pulls some petty bullshit like this.\n\nYou said it felt good to call her out. Why do you think that is? Did it feel surprisingly good? Maybe there's a reason for that. I'm guessing if you really think about it you'll spot a pattern of this kind of manipulation and guilt-tripping going back a nice long time.", "NTA your mum seems jealous of the relationship between your brother and your son", "NTA\nWhat your mother did was wrong, and she didn\u2019t do anything to rectify the situation once she realized how upset your son was. She should give them back so that your brother can put them back. It is his room after all, he should be able to decide what are on his walls", "NTA. It sounds like a tough situation all around, but your mother had no right to take the drawings, which were clearly beloved by your brother and son. Your father should not have guilted you by saying what he did- if he and your mother had kicked you out as a minor, they would have been very much in the wrong and he should realize that. That was not your mother being generous, it was her doing the right thing, and it does not give her a free pass to treat you or your son badly in the future. That being said, this is probably a symptom of other, more serious issues in your and your parents relationship. Name calling can only make it worse, regardless of whether or not it is justified. If you have the means, I would suggest doing whatever you can to move towards independence from your parents in the near future. Space may be what all of you need.", "NTA at all.. your mom *knew* she did something to crush her 4 YEAR OLD grandson's feelings that way and had the gall to sit there and comfort him like *she didn't know* what she did? That's *totally* heartless and 2 faced.. what was her end goal there? To let her own 14 year old CHILD take the blame for what she did, while also crushing his feelings as well? That's pretty disgusting of her. And I'm sorry. But anybody who wants to throw out their scared, confused, pregnant 16-year-old CHILD just for being pregnant is not being a good parent, either. Your mom's jealousy of the bond between a 4 year old and his uncle is weird and gross.. and I'm sorry but you can't convince me what she did wasn't out of spite because she was jealous your son's gift got the most attention/excitement from your brother.. BTW your brother sounds like an *amazing* brother and uncle and screw anybody who tries to interfere or damage that bond..", "NTA", "It's hard to call you TA in this situation (especially considering that your mom is so clearly a huge AH), but I've said things in the past that gave me that horrible-yet-satisfying feeling, and if I could go back and do it over, I'd have tried to give the message without the viciousness.\n\nWhen you strike out like that, the focus becomes how you said it rather than the very important thing you were trying to say. It basically gives the AH a way to completely ignore what you wanted them to hear and convince others that you were the only AH in the picture.", "You got alot of support on this for calling her out\n\nBut youre 20, an adult.\n\nWhats the point of losing it on her? Especially considering what your dad said.  \n\nReddit is always fast to support emotional off the rail actions but there was a time we taught people to stay calm and converse first, then go off the rail later", "I'm going against the grain on this one. \n\nYTA. You are 20 years old and living with your child at your parent's home - for free. What your Mom did was wrong. But, you can't go calling people names when you get upset. Speak to her like an adult and explain what upset you. She isn't acting very mature, but you are not either. If you don't like the way she behaves, you can go get another place to live and pay your own way. Your son and your brother are children. They have a lot more space to throw fits.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Unless she regularly goes around wiping walls down, there was no reason for her to do what she did. It sounds like their behavior towards you is to perpetually punish you, and punishing your son in the process.\n\nYou're not wrong that your mom's behavior was very wrong, but you may want to apologize in order to have a roof over your head. You may want to plan on moving out though. Your brother will be old enough soon to decide he wants to visit you and your child on his own. \n\nHowever, if we could imagine a different type of response from you to your mother in that situation, maybe it would be one where you or your brother ask where the drawings are and to put them back up? Whatever her answer is (maybe she says \"I threw them away\", or \"I don't want things hanging on the walls anymore\"), you and your brother should remind your son that he would like to keep them up, and that he loves him and loves his drawings just the same. \n\nBest of luck, sounds like you at least have a great brother.", "I agree with this, but personally still say nta, because how the father then came to tell how it was the mom who allowed her to stay as if that is a pass on all bad things mom does.", "The mother clearly did this on purpose to cause emotional harm and provoke a negative reaction.

But the hitting never met the crime like i'd accidentally spill a drink into the carpet and BAM suddenly i was punched in the side and im getting open hand slap after open hand slap to anywhere tht hand could reach on my back. Ever since ive made a permenant rule with my bf before we ever had our daughter. Punishment must fit the crime and INTENTION! SOo if she spills something by mistake then theres no punishment because the intention was for it not to happen the crime is usually she spilt some water like who cares about tht or even if its a staining thing like a strawberry well then ok we clean it together thats the consequence as that fits the crime perfectly. I hate and i genuinely mean HATE parents that hit or use basics like food or a home to punish kids thats literally evil in every sense", "My parents NEVER used corporeal punishment and I am grateful for that. But I did see when I was like 8 my friends father hit her 4/5 yo daughter with a belt on the bare bum, and that was shocking. I told my parents, who said that it isn\u2019t right, but some people still do it. Now I know that it was actually illegal even then!"]}
