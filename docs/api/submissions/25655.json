He\u2019s not responsible for supporting them in perpetuity once they\u2019re divorced.", "They don't have any kids! She used his money to be a stay-at-home mother to her children. They are 10 years old and the kids are old enough to be in school all day long. So she had all that time to go ahead and take a class or enter the workforce... She just didn't want to. Why should he get penalized for that now?\n\nThis is a guy that gets chauffeurs for his wife's kids.

How did they grew apart etc. Just talks about how he's sending the kids to private school and pays for a chauffeur. At this point and time, with uber existing, I doubt he's hired a 'professional chaffeur'. Anyone with a licence and a car can drive people around.\n\nSending the kids (who are 10!) to private school is not particularly note-worthy unless they needed it for a specific purpose such as specialised classes or certain extracurriculars.

I look at things logically. Kids that I did not create do not require my participation in their life once the decision has been made to be uncoupled. \n\nThe therapist that I see on a biweekly basis tends to agree that I have some of the stronger abilities to set boundaries and not subject to emotional manipulation by most people. \n\nHere\u2019s another unpopular opinion on this situation.

Write myself a paycheck, whatever lol anyway it does not need to be as high as it would be if I had to pay all those things I listed because those are all business expenses. Sounds like that's what OP did and he must have a business he can run out of his house.\n\nLet's say we started a restaurant. All those bills I mentioned up above would all be considered business expenses. So the first thing we would do is take all those off the top of how much money our restaurant brought in.

That's the taxable amount.\n\nYes we made $100,000 but since we couldn't have made that money without spending the $25,000 it's sort of doesn't count.

There is nowhere in the post that he convinced her to give up her job. And she is a grown up, she could decide for herself if she wanted to still keep working. But why work when op was supporting her and her kids?? Well, the answer is that he'll divorce you and your kids aren't his and you end up in this situation. Sucks to be her, but again, she chose this."]}
