We hang out quite often so nothing odd to report for most of the night. \n\nAt some point, Jeremy goes to the restroom and leaves the other three of us together.

Maybe 5 minutes pass and Jeremy returns from the restroom. Erin now thinks it\u2019s best to state that she will no longer be speaking around Clarke because he will not allow her to speak her mind. This is where I may be the asshole. I interjected and told her that he was 100% in bounds to ask her to stop her line of conversation as he was uncomfortable with it. I told her that he did not say anything to her in a rude way and that she cannot act like a child when people don\u2019t agree with her. \n\nErin and Jeremy left to sit in their car in the driveway at this point. I believe everything has settled, but Jeremy returns to yell anti-Semitic remarks at Clarke and myself. We are not Jewish, I just believe they were trying to be rude at this point. I do not wish to repeat what was said. I was told I\u2019d never see my niece again and once I woke up I\u2019d see how wrong I was. \n\nThis is really out of the left field and shocking to say the least.

When someone is \"just asking questions\" or \"hearing all sides\" on a subject involving nazis, they are not doing so in good faith. We can see it today from people espousing horrific beliefs that they're \"just protecting the children\" or \"looking out for their tribe\".

Even if he didn\u2019t know she was going to bring it up - and you should consider that maybe they actively planned to make a recruitment attempt - then when he heard about it, he doubled down and took the mask fully off.\n\nYour brother and SIL are not just exploring conspiracy theories. They are fully radicalised and actively recruiting to a hate ideology; if they are not neoNazis, they are absolutely their fellow travellers and sympathisers.\n\nThere is a saying that if there is a table of ten people sat down together, choosing to spend time together, and one is openly a Nazi\u2026 then what is at that table is ten Nazis.

That doesn't change the terrible things he said, did, and believed in.\n\n\nFrom my experiences with right wing propaganda, the meme that \"the only good thing he did was kill Hitler\" does more harm than good as the far right can use the few legitimate examples where he was correct - such as not smoking - to instill doubt in people who are already disillusioned, making it far easier to convince them that everything Hitler did was actually good."]}
