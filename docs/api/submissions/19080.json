My brother is no longer speaking to me over this. For the purpose of this story, my brother (M,26) is named Jeremy. My sister in law (F, 24) is named Erin. My boyfriend(M,26) is named Clarke. \n\nOn Saturday night I was hanging out with Clarke, Jeremy, and Erin and things were going normally. We hang out quite often so nothing odd to report for most of the night. \n\nAt some point, Jeremy goes to the restroom and leaves the other three of us together. Clarke was explaining to Erin a bit of the backstory of the game we were currently playing. Out of nowhere she interrupts him and says, \u201cSo hear me out\u2026.what if Hitler wasn\u2019t wrong?!\u201d We are both shocked by this random turn of conversation. Clarke, calmly and with more patience that I could ever have, said, \u201cNope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I will not entertain this train of thought. And if you\u2019d like to discuss conspiracy theories. Maybe don\u2019t lead with \u2018What if Hitler wasn\u2019t wrong\u2019 just a word of advice!\u201d This is where I should add that Erin has been really into conspiracy theories lately, so he believes she was wanting to discuss some conspiracy she read. \n\nErin just says okay and things are awkward but we continue playing our game while she sits there watching. Maybe 5 minutes pass and Jeremy returns from the restroom. Erin now thinks it\u2019s best to state that she will no longer be speaking around Clarke because he will not allow her to speak her mind. This is where I may be the asshole. I interjected and told her that he was 100% in bounds to ask her to stop her line of conversation as he was uncomfortable with it. I told her that he did not say anything to her in a rude way and that she cannot act like a child when people don\u2019t agree with her. \n\nErin and Jeremy left to sit in their car in the driveway at this point. I believe everything has settled, but Jeremy returns to yell anti-Semitic remarks at Clarke and myself. We are not Jewish, I just believe they were trying to be rude at this point. I do not wish to repeat what was said. I was told I\u2019d never see my niece again and once I woke up I\u2019d see how wrong I was. \n\nThis is really out of the left field and shocking to say the least.
