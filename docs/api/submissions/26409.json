While I have a lot of insecurities,  hair never used to be one of them. All my hair is very blonde and it's never really been a problem or visibly noticable. It doesnt grow any faster or thicker than any regular girl.\n\nSince dating he has pulled away from day-old stubbly hair on my legs or the hairs on my arms (which I'd never shaved before him and had always been quite soft and very blonde/light in color), etc. He says its a texture issue, it bothers him when its prickly. He has made comments anytime he noticed and hasn't failed to let me know when I've skipped a day.\n\n I used to shave legs, pits, intimates maybe once or twice a week. Since discussing his preference I've shaved more often and now EVERYWHERE. No inch of skin is spared. Since moving in two weeks ago together, I've had to shave daily in fear I'll \"ick\" him out. It's causing rashing, ingrown hairs, cuts and bleeding, and stinging pain and discomfort. Recently he made the comment \"sometimes I can't tell if I'm kissing  Anna or I'm kissing Andrew.\" Implying I'm as hairy as a man. Which is untrue, I shave more than most girls I know. \n\nI spoke to him about the pain and how i thought it was unrealistic, and he offered to pay for a waxing. He doesn't seem to mind the idea of me cold and naked on a metal table spreading in front of a stranger. Not to mention the pain that comes with it, and the discomfort following days after. This also doesnt resolve the week i have to let that hair grow back out so it can be waxed again, which would mean long sleeves and pants for these time periods. His response to this was \"winter is coming up anyways\" \n\nI said it's a lot to ask, his reasoning is \"if you asked me I would.\" And I haven't. I've asked for no changes regarding appearance, maintenance, or state of dress at any time in our dating. He could NOT say the same. And I have been very accommodating and gracious with all of these asks, because I love him. \n\nNothing ever feels smooth enough, I have become neurotic and borderline obsessive, shaving everyday, sometimes twice. I feel insecure when he reaches for me (even just holding hands, brushing past me, whatever) in case he feels hair, or the day-after-shaving-stuble. \n\nI had suggested abstinence (it's been well over a week as it is) until we find a better solution that doesnt leave me feeling gross and insecure and in pain, and he thought it was absurd. In the grande scheme of things Maybe I'm being over reactive? Am I the asshole for not wanting to be touched? \n(Breaking up simply isn't an option, I'd much rather be unhappy about shaving than leaving, but it's getting in the way of our relationship) Am I just an ex-hippy with silly-gross standards? Should I suck it up and wax?", "created_utc": 1694126884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ct5d6/aita_for_suggesting_abstinence/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You saying you\u2019d stay w him even though it\u2019s obviously causing you discomfort is baffling. If he\u2019s not okay w you how you are why would you even want to be w him?

She told him, \"You first.\" Offered to do his balls that day, but shockingly he declined.\n\nWhen I was younger and more insecure about stuff that doesnt matter I used to obsessively remove my body hair prior to my boyfriend's visits. Would even go over my body with tweezers to find any little straggler. (I have a scar on hand from a horrible hot wax experience as a reminder of that time.) At some point in the last 5 years I decided to stop caring. I still shave, but not daily, not even weekly. And I never shave before first intimacy with a partner because I want them to see me as I am and want to be and if that's not a good fir for them then we are not a good fit and best to find that out now.\n\nDo yourself a favor and move on from this relationship. I cannot tell you how freeing it was to spend my first night with my current partner with hairy legs and have him... not even notice, let alone say anything about it. To know that someone wants to be with you and not some idealized version of you. You are trapping yourself in a routine that will leave you unhappy and physically uncomfortable.\n\nNTA for suggesting abstinence for any reason. This is your relationship too and you get to make suggestions. But please be better to yourself. You deserve it.\n\nAnd just want to add--when you are hairy you do NOT feel like Andrew.

In my current relationship we are together through choice, not obsession or fear of loneliness.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in you asking your question. You\u2019re going to keep shaving daily or waxing too often for comfort, and you shouldn\u2019t. You aren\u2019t going to leave him, but you should. In order to do that, you need to be kinder to yourself but also be prepared to go through some pain to end up in a better situation. It\u2019s often hard to do that when you\u2019re 21.\n\nWhat if it was a friend? A niece? A sister? Your mum? Your future daughter if you want one.

You should never need to feel gross, insecure, uncomfortable or in pain to please your partner ( unless that\u2019s your kink). Women have body hair, we are not hairless below our chins (Generally).   \n\n\nDoes he even like you as a human?  If he thinks it\u2019s not a big deal, he can shave every day every where.

I guarantee you, no other woman would have him.  He either figures this out with you or he gets to be single forever.\n\nHere\u2019s what you don\u2019t do:  You don\u2019t internalize that this has anything to do with you.  This is not your issue.  It\u2019s his.

No reasonable and loving partner would ask this of you. \n\nPlease rethink this. He may seem like a great catch, but he isn't. Throw the whole man away.", "NTA. This is beyond unreasonable and he's not the one that has to deal with the pain of shaving and waxing every day to meet his \"standards.\"\n\nIf he's been willing to pay for waxing and says he would do it if you asked, then see if he means it. Don't get rid of *any* body hair until he goes completely hairless for at least one month, the exact same way you have been doing. You have been doing this daily for 3 years to meet his standards. He can handle a month.\n\nIf he argues it's unreasonable or unnecessary, then it should be the same for you. If he cannot live up to his own standards, but is willing to see you endure pain and discomfort for him, then that should tell you he doesn't view you as an equal. Your *pain* is less important than his wants. How is that fair in a relationship?\n\nThis is about more than body hair, though. He finds your natural body disgusting and is demanding you change it so he can love you. That's not love. That's the first step to abuse. I find it extremely telling that he can't stand body hair but can supposedly handle his own. You already know that when he touches you it will turn into critiques and make you feel worse. You are afraid of him.\n\nHe understands perfectly well that these insults and critiques of your body make you feel worse. You've been explaining to him valid reasons why you shouldn't  need to shave everyday for 3 years. He understands fine. He just doesn't care. This argument won't resolve until you give in. He doesn't see you as an equal or as your own person. He loves when you fit his mold, not who you are as a person.\n\nWhat he wants is to control you and whittle down your self esteem. He likes seeing you prove your love to him. That's why he's demanding this of you and is mad when you're okay with being abstinent. He needs you to jump when he tells you. Any alternative shows you still have free will. That's what makes him mad. Not body hair.", "NTA\n\nWhy isn't leaving an option, if he thinks he's entitled to sex and doesn't care that he's literally causing you pain and suffering and doesn't care?\n\nHe doesn't love you. You loves the idea of the perfect hairless woman. And if you can't give him that perfection, you're no longer good enough. He's actually mentally abusing you and you don't even see it, OP.", "Adding: if you\u2019re determined to stay in this relationship, I\u2019m not sure what you want to happen. I mean, you can suggest abstinence of course, but that isn\u2019t going to be a long term solution & I think you probably know that. Either party weaponising sex is going to end badly.\n\nReal talk: I don\u2019t think you should wax against your will, *however* as someone who does wax (Brazilian & underarms - my arms & legs are oddly hairless) in a way it may be easier on you than the daily shaving. Hair growth slows & it grows back finer & can become non-existent. The ingrown hairs don\u2019t seem to happen (for me) & the growth doesn\u2019t seem to be sore/prickly like it is with shaving. I kind of hate myself for even typing this because I don\u2019t want him to \u2018win\u2019 over this, but at least you have the information. \n\nIf you do choose the waxing route, make sure he has an appt before yours so he can do it for moral support. Let him know you want him completely hairless - groin, legs, arms, chest - you want it all to be gone. :)\n\nNote, in *no way* am I encouraging you do it for him or against your will.

I would never want one of my kids in a relationship that had conditions like yours has. It\u2019s really not feasible for you to be hair-free. What happens if/when you get pregnant and have a child? You will not physically be able to shave everywhere then and won\u2019t have time to do it once the child arrives. This is not sustainable.\n\nIf this is \u201cthe perfect guy\u201d in every other way, HE is the one who needs to make modifications. I think some kind of therapy/desentization kind of exercises. Do you have a pet? How is he with animals?\n\n  \nI also don\u2019t like the Anna/Andrew comment. It comes off as very homophobic and gives me some pause, as in perhaps he is afraid of facing something he doesn\u2019t like about his own sexuality.\n\nPlease reconsider staying in this relationship unless he gets some help.", "This abusive OP.  You *could* make the same demand of him, but honestly you will break up anyway because this is an absolutely unlivable situation.  Anna or Andrew? Fuck this abusive asshole.

He is being unreasonable and controlling, and he's prioritizing his own preferences over your comfort in your own skin. You are making all the effort here, and he is not. It's not *just* about shaving, it's about how he's treating you because of the shaving. He's making you feel lesser because you physically cannot conform to his expectations because his expectations are ridiculous and unrealistic and treat you as a doll, not a human person. \n\nYou're not gross. You're not wrong. I also shave once a week or so. I've gotten waxed a few times (it's really not that bad, the technicians have seen so many clients that they absolutely don't judge, and part of their job is to prioritize your comfort), but I did it because I wanted it, not because anyone told me to. It's your body. Do what you want with it.", "NTA. Take him waxing. Make sure they wax his balls and ass Crack. And say you will do it only if he also does, each time.", "NTA. We have hair because we\u2019re mammals. He isn\u2019t shaving all his body hair off already? He just wants you to? That\u2019s a control thing. And to be honest anyone who doesn\u2019t want body hair that comes in with puberty on an adult sounds like a perv. Have you been told you look younger than 21? You say breaking up isn\u2019t an option. Yes it is. It might be a hassle but if you don\u2019t have anyone who can take you in then find a women\u2019s shelter that can help or provide  contacts that can. It\u2019s body hair now but then it will be clothes, friends, and how you spend your money later on. Let as much body hair grow as you want.

He goes first.", "NTA but your partner is. You say breaking up isn\u2019t an option but you really need to reconsider because this man doesn\u2019t respect your or treat you the way someone who really loves would. His extreme aversion to hair is something he needs to get help with from a mental health professional. It\u2019s not normal. Being paranoid about whether or not you shaved enough isn\u2019t healthy and it\u2019s no way to life. I have never shaved my arm hair and I probably never will. It\u2019s soft, not prickly.

You keep saying that breaking up is not an option because there are no other hiccups in your relationship. Is that because you agree on absolutely everything or because you usually take his side of things? How often are you accommodating his requests vs him accommodating yours? Everyone here is telling you to question your relationship because you seem to be bending over backwards for him and he doesn\u2019t care how much pain it causes you as long as he gets his way.

While I have a lot of insecurities,  hair never used to be one of them. All my hair is very blonde and it's never really been a problem or visibly noticable. It doesnt grow any faster or thicker than any regular girl.\n\nSince dating he has pulled away from day-old stubbly hair on my legs or the hairs on my arms (which I'd never shaved before him and had always been quite soft and very blonde/light in color), etc. He says its a texture issue, it bothers him when its prickly. He has made comments anytime he noticed and hasn't failed to let me know when I've skipped a day.\n\n I used to shave legs, pits, intimates maybe once or twice a week. Since discussing his preference I've shaved more often and now EVERYWHERE. No inch of skin is spared. Since moving in two weeks ago together, I've had to shave daily in fear I'll \"ick\" him out. It's causing rashing, ingrown hairs, cuts and bleeding, and stinging pain and discomfort. Recently he made the comment \"sometimes I can't tell if I'm kissing  Anna or I'm kissing Andrew.\" Implying I'm as hairy as a man. Which is untrue, I shave more than most girls I know. \n\nI spoke to him about the pain and how i thought it was unrealistic, and he offered to pay for a waxing. He doesn't seem to mind the idea of me cold and naked on a metal table spreading in front of a stranger. Not to mention the pain that comes with it, and the discomfort following days after. This also doesnt resolve the week i have to let that hair grow back out so it can be waxed again, which would mean long sleeves and pants for these time periods. His response to this was \"winter is coming up anyways\" \n\nI said it's a lot to ask, his reasoning is \"if you asked me I would.\" And I haven't. I've asked for no changes regarding appearance, maintenance, or state of dress at any time in our dating. He could NOT say the same. And I have been very accommodating and gracious with all of these asks, because I love him. \n\nNothing ever feels smooth enough, I have become neurotic and borderline obsessive, shaving everyday, sometimes twice. I feel insecure when he reaches for me (even just holding hands, brushing past me, whatever) in case he feels hair, or the day-after-shaving-stuble. \n\nI had suggested abstinence (it's been well over a week as it is) until we find a better solution that doesnt leave me feeling gross and insecure and in pain, and he thought it was absurd. In the grande scheme of things Maybe I'm being over reactive? Am I the asshole for not wanting to be touched? \n(Breaking up simply isn't an option, I'd much rather be unhappy about shaving than leaving, but it's getting in the way of our relationship) Am I just an ex-hippy with silly-gross standards? Should I suck it up and wax?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
