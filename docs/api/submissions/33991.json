{"id": 33991, "submission_id": "18twjbp", "title": "AITA for saying my brother is selfish for planning to go on a trip and leave his girlfriend alone with their baby?", "selftext": "My (26F) half-brother (39M) met his girlfriend (36F) a little over a year ago. She unexpectedly got pregnant and they decided to keep the baby. The birth is supposed to be in March.\n\nIn July, my brother and father are going on a three-week bike tour of some Nordic countries. His girlfriend will be left alone to care for the baby as well as the house, the vegetables, the garden, and all their animals (a flock of sheep and a dog). Her family lives abroad and while my brother's mother will be able to come by occasionally to help, she won't be able to stay the whole time as her health is poor and she's elderly. It should be noted that the girlfriend herself has a heart condition and a mid-risk pregnancy (the baby is fine).\n\nI recently overheard my brother and father talking together about the trip, with my brother saying that his girlfriend always knew that trip was in the cards since it was my brother's present to himself for his 40th birthday, and he \"told her so since they first met\". When I later tried talking to them separately about postponing the trip a year or so, that was the same reason I got. I pointed out that the baby wasn't planned and should take priority over a trip, but they both got defensive and said I was welcome to go help her if I cared so much. The problem is a) I work, b) I'll already be caring for my elderly grandmother while my father is away on said trip, and c) I can't stand babies and they know that.\n\nI called my brother selfish and immature. My father said I was being too judgmental as usual.\n\nETA: The girlfriend is not fine with the trip. She's a first-time mom who knows nothing about babies and is very anxious about childbirth and childrearing, especially since she has no support system here. I don't know whether she and my brother had a conversation that prompted the one between my brother and father about the trip, but she's a traditional and selfless person who frequently does too much for others even when she suffers from it. That's also why I'm worried about her.", "created_utc": 1703881578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18twjbp/aita_for_saying_my_brother_is_selfish_for/", "score": 2102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Expect the sheep to starve and the garden to spoil unless your bro steps up and arranges care for those 2 demanding tasks!

She unexpectedly got pregnant and they decided to keep the baby. The birth is supposed to be in March.\n\nIn July, my brother and father are going on a three-week bike tour of some Nordic countries. His girlfriend will be left alone to care for the baby as well as the house, the vegetables, the garden, and all their animals (a flock of sheep and a dog). Her family lives abroad and while my brother's mother will be able to come by occasionally to help, she won't be able to stay the whole time as her health is poor and she's elderly. It should be noted that the girlfriend herself has a heart condition and a mid-risk pregnancy (the baby is fine).\n\nI recently overheard my brother and father talking together about the trip, with my brother saying that his girlfriend always knew that trip was in the cards since it was my brother's present to himself for his 40th birthday, and he \"told her so since they first met\". When I later tried talking to them separately about postponing the trip a year or so, that was the same reason I got. I pointed out that the baby wasn't planned and should take priority over a trip, but they both got defensive and said I was welcome to go help her if I cared so much. The problem is a) I work, b) I'll already be caring for my elderly grandmother while my father is away on said trip, and c) I can't stand babies and they know that. \n\nI called my brother selfish and immature.

It might also be paid for and it sounds like your dad might be paying for it seeing as he's going with his son.\n\nThey also have no idea what having a newborn entails.  Your brother maybe able to afford this trip and he's also 40 and thinks that life will go on as normal even with a child as he'll probably be quite set in his ways.\n\nHis girlfriend has chosen to keep the baby (completely her right to do so) but may have chosen a non optimal person to be the father.  Was she actually hoping to get pregnant but your half brother not so much so she had an oopsie?  Her biological clock was ticking and some women, as they get older, end up with an urge to have a kid right before they start hitting perimenopause.  And especially if she's into traditional gender roles.  So she may have thought this was her last chance to have a baby herself.  But contraception is not foolproof.  There's always a chance of pregnancy unless there's no ovaries or uterus or a successful vasectomy.\n\nShe is also older and also a bit set in her ways and probably a reasonably organised person... who have no idea how disorganised a baby can be.  Some babies don't like routines.. and then they change it and it's messy.\n\nIt would be a very good idea to postpone this trip.  The baby will be 15/16 months old if it's postponed by a year and the girlfriend will have more support hopefully.\n\nHaving said that, a 3/4 month old can be easier to look after if it's a settled baby than a toddler wanting to run around and do stuff and fight sleep.  Breastfeeding is usually established or you're pretty good with bottle feeding.\n\nThe girlfriends issue is more that there is no support for her where she is and she's expected to keep the household running.  I'd be letting the garden go in that 3 weeks.  Water it but that's about it.  Her neighbours can help here, even if it's just holding the baby while she picks the vegies and waters the garden.  Same with the sheep.  Dog just needs to be fed.\n\nBut if your half brother is not interested in the baby and expects her to do everything, then she's got bigger issues to think about.\n\nShe would be far better off going back home to her family before the child is born... especially if they can't come out after the kid is born or be there when your half brother is away.  \n\nYou're not helpful and it's not your issue whether he goes or stays so this isn't something you should keep bringing up.  I don't think much of him for doing this but not your problem either as you aren't going to be able to help.  Does your grandmother need help 24/7.  Can she be left for periods during the day because if she can, you would be able to go and help her.  You don't have to do baby related things but you could help with the garden or the animals or even help with cooking a meal.  In fact you could bring your grandma and all eat together.\n\nHowever you are not obligated to help your half brothers girlfriend just because you are female.

Even if you cant stand babies, you can still volunteer to help with the garden or animals, cook food to bring over/your mom can bring that can be reheated, send her food delivery, organize the meal train with her friends and your family (if your brother is useless), do laundry, help locate any of the aforementioned staff she will need.
