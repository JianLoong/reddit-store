Now don't get me wrong, I love them, but while we are there I can't rest or catch up on my work due to how loud they are all getting and how intrusive they get.

They think you're sad or down and that they can fix you by...... Back TF off me, you are the cause!\n\n(We would have a support group for this issue, but we just don't want to be around each other) \n\nBut an ex did make me a \"I'm in a time out\" sign for our bedroom door when we visited family. It was laminated and I would write, released at 1:15. It was our compromise to me wanting to spend the whole day and night in there and me making an effort to bond with his really nice (but amazingly effusive) family \n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  I'm pretty much the same when it comes to being social, so I understand entirely.  However, the minute they'd have laughed at me and called me entitled?  I'd have packed my shit up and gone to the hotel there and then.", "I think this is the way. \n\nOne thing with people like this, and I am related to a lot of people like this, is that you need to ignore their comments. Never show fear. Never back down once you have made a decision.\n\nBook that hotel room. Establish in your mind the hours you are willing to spend in that home, say 8 am to 10 pm. That\u2019s a long day of family togetherness.\n\nAnd then stick to that schedule. No explanations. No arguments. No discussions. Just, \u201cHi, I\u2019m here!\u201d and \u201cBye bye! I\u2019m leaving now!\u201d The later said as you are actually stepping through the door.\n\nYour husband can join you or not as he chooses.  But don\u2019t argue or discuss things with him. Establish your time line with him before the visit, and then ask him, just before you leave, if he is coming. Accept whatever answer he gives and leave, with or without him. If he tries to get you to stay, smile, kiss him goodbye and leave.\n\nWhat I have found with family members who bully me, is that when I just don\u2019t engage with them, when I ignore their comments and slights, when I pretend that their comments don\u2019t hurt and can\u2019t influence me, and I do what I have said I will do\u2014they stop. Or at least greatly reduce their bullying attempts.", "I have tried not going and it causes way too much drama. Plus unfortunately husband is on some medication which he needs to take at specific times during the day and if he is there by himself he forgets/nobody reminds him. And not taking them will affect his health. (I have tried texts but he doesn't always have his phone on him)", "Yea, this family is definitely not okay for bullying/guilting her to stay, but I think it's almost conditioning/survival. You grow up in a tiny house, 1 bathroom, 8 kids. You have to delude yourself into thinking that it's the greatest and everyone loves constantly having other people in their space. Only way to survive.", "He has to take responsibility for that himself. Otherwise you could be worrying about his medication for the rest of your life.\n\nDon't visit or stay in a hotel or let him go alone.

Take 2 cars next time.  Stay in a hotel.  He can sleep at his parent's house alone.  It's up to you to decide to  keep putting yourself in this position.\n\nGood luck.", "Your husband is an adult who can take care of his own meds.

Being intrusive has negative connotations. Telling them how to be in my own house, yeah that would not fly with me. Calling you an entitled asshole is not ok either, just to make that clear.", "Stop going over there!!\n\nNta", "NTA. You need to start staying in a hotel though, regardless of their insistence. You have every right to set some boundaries for your own needs, but you can't dictate anyone else's behavior. All you can do is figure out a way to hold your boundaries in a way they can't violate - hence, hotel. But also, they're being real dicks if their response to you expressing your very reasonable needs is to laugh at you and call you entitled.", "NTA... get a hotel room or dont joint hubby on visits.\n\nTalking to an influential family member about it 1on 1 would have been more effective... maybe", "Exactly.  Stay in a hotel - and commit X amount of time each day to hanging out with family - like 5-8.  If anyone says anything keep your answers the same and super boring.  \"I've got a couple conference calls so I need to work at the hotel\".  \"I have to log in early so I have to go to the hotel and get some sleep\".  Then change the subject.  If they push just repeat the exact same thing and change the subject again.  Make it boring and frustrating to talk about.  \n\nIf you need to skip family time one day tell them you have diarrhea and don't want to take up the bathroom so it is easier to stay at the hotel.\n\nLet your partner say at the house if he wants, just hold down your boundries and don't budge.", "Why should you be completely miserable for a week every few months just because your grown adult spouse can\u2019t remember to take his daily medications? That\u2019s ridiculous.", "Then stay at the hotel alone if necessary and call your husband to remind him ( though to be honest since he's a darn adult that shouldn't be necessary) or better yet set him  alarms on his phone ( again he should do this himself...)\n\nNTA.", "He can set alerts on his own phone or a Smart watch. \n\nGet a hotel room and have some peace of mind.", "His incompetence shouldn\u2019t mean you have to suffer. \n\nHe can have his overbearing mom remind him or set a reminder. This is not your responsibility.\n\nLike seriously what would he do if you took a basic trip by yourself???", "TA in this story is your husband.  He has 0 respect for you & what you need.  You've asked to stay in a hotel for more privacy & my guess is he refused.  Then the family had the nerve to call you an entitled AH?  Like, WTF?  You've asked for some privacy & there is no good reason they can't give it to you.  The family who laughed at you are AH's too.

Somehow you end up at their house even though you insist on a hotel.\n\nSo STOP GOING UNLESS YOU HAVE A HOTEL.\n\nNTA except to yourself.
