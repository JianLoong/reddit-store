However, I think we have to put ourselves in OPs position- she suddenly had to cope with a foster sibling 6 years older and bigger who was angry and traumatised. That must have been very scary and she would have felt powerless for most of her childhood and only now feels able to start talking about the impact this has had on her.\n\nReddit is all for NC for unpleasant adult family members, but when a teen starts to express boundaries as a result of her childhood being destroyed by Mike, she\u2019s the villain.", "What have ur parents done to deal with this?

I can also see how him being adopted would make him more sensitive to being excluded from the family photo but honestly? Wouldn't happen if he wasn't being a dick to you.\n\nPeople on this sub all the time advocate for \"chosen\" and \"found\" family and cutting off harmful people.

People tend to pretend that being a family means all is forgiven, but in reality, it\u2019s hard to feel much for a household that doesn\u2019t make you feel like you belong or a person who more often than not is annoying to you.", "ESH tbh\n\n your parents should have put him in therapy and gotten those anger issues and maybe depression under control. \n\nFor you it was pretty petty and mean to exclude him out of a family telling him he doesn't belong to the family.\n\nFor him. He is an adult. By now he should have gone to therapy on his own accord and checked his behavior.\n\nI think it is unfair to expect a teenager who had to live 10 years with someone that aggressive and draining to be on their best behavior. If he was her blood brother nobody would have batted an eye to this situation and sure everyone would say that the parents failed both kids but no one would say that she is an ah to want her family back, not live with someone draining the mood and tending to explode.\nApart from that yes we don't know how his life was before he got adopted, but I do think that constantly saying he hates everyone even the hand helping and feeding him is not right. No adopted children don't necessarily need to be grateful to be treated right but idk... it sits wrong with me that he isn't even the slightest thankful that he got adopted. Someone above said that he maybe was 11 years in the foster system where it is awful. Yeah no questions but maybe especially then be at least slightly grateful. \n\nI think it is pretty normal that a child who has to live with someone always mad and depressed is not going to like them or see them as a sibling. \nTherapy will be needed for all of them.", "YTA.\n\nSiblings fight, they're still family.

But to say that has ruined your life or that, that is a good excuse for excluding him from a family photo is immature and self centred.\n\nI was a 16 year old girl once too and I can understand the way you must be feeling... We are allowed to feel whatever we feel, it's what we do with those feelings that make us the asshole, or not the asshole.\n\nWhat you did was calculated and spiteful, regardless of your feelings and it makes you the asshole.", "Whether you like him or not, he's your brother.

He was in the fister system till around 11. Imagine having to deal boucing around homes to home knowing your bio parents just abandoned you. He most likely has a lot to be upset about and if he hasn't had help to address his feelings about this then they can lead to a lot of anger. Now you saying to him he isn't family bc he is adopted? You clearly can't even imagine how that feels. HUGE YTA! If you can't actually provide examples of how he treats you then you just seem like an entitled brat. Siblings don't get along all the time and being adopted or not means nothing as he is still your brother. Maybe tell him you are sorry about him not being family and that you are just upset bc you feel like he treats you poorly and that you wish he would treat you kindly as you understand he was bot dealt the hand but its no reason to treat me the way you have and that you would like a good relationship with you. \n\nYou need to learn this that people have shit happening in their life and they act out so instead of meeting their level of crap try asking them whats going on and help them get that chip off their shoulder and you will be surprised how many people open up and the friends you could actually make.

It would have been very hurtful, embarrassing and belittling for him and at 16 you have a voice, you can hold a conversation and you clearly are okay to speak your mind so doing what you did wasn\u2019t necessary or productive. If every conversation ends in an argument with him then there are ways you could have talked to him and explain how your interactions and relationship makes you feel and you could have done it by using non accusationary, non provoking, non triggering things and used \u201cI feel\u201d instead of \u201cyou cause\u201d \n\nYour parents clearly aren\u2019t doing enough to mediate this situation. When adopting a child the parents should always take into account how it will affect the existing people in the house and if he has always been problematic then they should have worked on getting him the help he needed and not let things progress this far \n\nOn a side note though it shouldn\u2019t be understated how much a single negative person in a home can grind you down and the effect it can have on someone\u2019s wellbeing and happiness. Your home and your family are your safe space and when there\u2019s someone who\u2019s apart of that who causes only negative emotions then gradually it can become consuming and take a massive toll on someone and I can see this is where you\u2019re at.

A child whose life before he came to your family was most likely horrid. He was a child of the system with no family, no parents and no one to give a shit about him! Then your parents adopted Mike and by doing so gave him something he has never had\u2026a real family! I wondering if you weren\u2019t adopted. How are your parents so giving and loving and you\u2019re so selfish. \nIt was a family picture and Mike ***is*** family!!\nYou have no idea what it must\u2019ve been like to hav no one and be in foster care or how the families before treated Mike.

They're also Mike's. And you're siblings. And as far as I can see, the most he's done is be a bit of a dick.

That's not exactly an unprecedented time to still be living with parents.", "Sounds like you have the same attitude towards him.", "I understand it\u2019d be hard to get along with him but he is still part of the family, even if he\u2019s rude.

This isn't a world where everyone moves out at 18, so don't be surprised if you still live there at his age. \n\nYou need to figure out what the real problem is concerning yourself, not how he treats your parents. Is he just annoying to be around? Because, adopted or not, we all got family members like that. Your parents made a decision to bring him into their lives. Are you angry that you weren't included in this decision? Because how he treats them is their problem, not yours. You need to focus on yourself and what this relationship is to you.

So, get your shit together and stop acting like he ruined your life, because he didn't. However, if you let that idea run your life, it will ruin your life. Not him. He has no control over you unless you let him. And I'm not talking physical control, but you've given him a place in your head as 'The Enemy' and that took your control away.
