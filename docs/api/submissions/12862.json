I still work adoption events and I am a qualified rehabber.\n\nDid I leave anything out?\n\nI have a lot of interests and hobbies. I've had a busy  few years. \n\nDoesn't mean I work 5 jobs.

This needs to be done, or you could find yourself out on the street, with no housing again, if you landlord changes his mind, gets a better offer, etc.  Or you could be 5 years down the road paying rent, and for improvements and he could sell it and not reimburse you for anything.

I've been here for almost 7 years.", "I posts a comment above. Our attorneys are hashing out the paperwork. The full \"purchase price\" is in the contract.

Thank you. :)", "Both of our attorneys are hashing out the paperwork as we speak. This isn't a stranger.
