This has been a fact since we got married and had kids. This applys to both sides of the family. \n\nSo today around 4:30, I hear a knock at the door and it turns out it's my in-laws. My husband isn't home at this point so I quickly call him to see if they'd talked to him about coming over. He says no they hadn't. I check my messages and missed calls and voicemail. They didn't call or next me either. I answer the door and ask them what they needed \n\nThey ask to see our daughter who isn't even home. She's at my mom's house visiting for the week since my husband and I are in that process of closing on a house and moving out of our rental home.  So we are not in any shape to receive guests. \n\nI ask them if they called or texted my husband or myself and they admit they had hadn't but they didn't see the issue since I was home. I remind them of our rule and tell them they need to leave. My FIL gets huffy saying they drove over an hour to see our daughter and they should be allowed in. \n\nI explained that I understand that but since they didn't check with us first they needed to leave. I go to close the door and my MIL puts her foot in the way to prevent the door from closing. At this point I'm getting extremely frustrated as I have other things I need to take care of. \n\nMy MIL explains that since it was such a long drive they should at least be let in for a few minutes to visit. At this point my husband comes home and my in laws are under the impression my husband will let them in. He doesn't. He tells them to leave and at this point they're trespassing. \n\nWe have a no trespassing sign on a tree by the house. It's clearly visible. My husband reminds them of our rule and tells them to leave. They refuse. My husband then tells them he has no choice but to call the police and have them removed from the property. \n\nMy in-laws think he's bluffing but my husband isn't a bluffer. He calls the sheriff and has his parents removed from the property. His parents are extremely upset saying we're assholes for not letting them break the rule. I do honestly feel a little bad since they did drive an hour to see our daughter.

Sounds like they tried to push a boundary and were peeved when it failed.", "\\>  My in-laws think he's bluffing but my husband isn't a bluffer. He calls the sheriff and has his parents removed from the property. \n\nThank your husband for having such a shiny titanium spine.  Seriously.\n\n\\>  I do honestly feel a little bad since they did drive an hour to see our daughter. \n\nWhy?  You said so yourself.  They knew your policy from the start.  They chose to waste their time.\n\nNTA, but your husband is fuckin gold, keep him forever.", "Not just your rule but common courtesy, right? You never know if someone's able to receive guests, check in first. A sheriff escort off the property sounds harsh but...if they're habitual line steppers, well met.", "NTA. They drove an hour to see a child who wasn\u2019t even there. Had they called they would have known. You both reminded them that you don\u2019t allow people over without notice and they still chose to not leave.", "NTA and anyone who says ESH or YTA has never had to deal with narcissist in-laws.", "I  look at r/JUSTNOMIL everyday and I'm sure it's safe to assume you guys have this rule for a reason.\n\nI know calling the Sheriff seems harsh but to the people saying Y T A/ E S H - have you ever made someone feel so uncomfortable by crossing their boundaries they threatened to call the cops? Probably not, right? \n\nIn-laws clearly have a problem with following rules and are completely unhinged.\n\nOP good for you for making your boundaries clear and sticking to them.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: Spelling", "NTA. The rule applies to both sides of the family. I\u2019m going to assume you have your reasons for having the rule. \n\nMoreover, you told them to leave. Your husband told them to leave. Your husband warned them the police would be called. What the heck did they think was going to happen? If you let them in at that point, you\u2019re setting a precedent that they can come whenever they want without warning. This is clearly what they were hoping would happen. \n\nThey tried to be manipulative by guilting you with the \u201clong drive\u201d crap. You didn\u2019t fall for it. Good for you. \n\nI don\u2019t understand all these people saying you suck or went too far. They were warned and given plenty of opportunity.", "NTA sounds like a hard rule. Sounds like his parents don\u2019t like that rule. Sounds like they made a power play move to check that rule. Seems like a rule. Bet you his parents had hard rules they enforced, he seems comfortable with them.", "NTA. But maybe don\u2019t share your new address with your boundary stomping ILs. Personally the rule at our house is you wait to be invited over before you come. Inviting yourself to someone else\u2019s house is rude AF.  This rule is frankly common sense enough that we never had to tell anyone about this rule. Normal people just already do it.", "NTA.  You have a rule.  They know the rule.  They didn't follow the rule and then refused to leave after being told multiple times to do so.  If they live an hour away and they know you have to be contacted before coming over, it's their fault they drove all that way for nothing.", " NTA. You set boundaries and they broke them. A simple phone call from them would have told them their reason for coming (to see your daughter) was pointless anyway since she wasn't home.  \n\nSome of you weren't raised by abusive, manipulative, self-esteem shredding parents and for all of you, I'm genuinely happy you never experienced that.", "Okay, for everyone complaining that OP and her husband took it too far: how many times do we tell people to put up boundaries and not let people in their homes if they just show up?\n\nNow everyone is pearl-clutching, saying OP and husband are horrible.\n\nSMH\n\nOP, NTA", "That is one f\u2019d up family dynamic, but NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to feel bad. They know your boundaries and they tried to force you to do what they wanted. You asked them to leave and they refused. That\u2019s on them. This happened because of THEIR poor choices.", "I'm going to get down voted but NTA\n\nThey live an hour away? That means they had an hour+ to call/text to give you a heads up or ask for permission. Kudos to you and your husband for sticking by your rules. They lacked boundaries and MIL sticking her foot in the door escalated things. \n\nWhat id you were renovating, had guest over, or didn't feel like entertaining. People think having family over is easy but there is still a level of hosting that is expected. \n\nNTA", "Honestly, the biggest thing is that they could have, and were told to, call first.\"We drove an hour\" loses its impact when they could have checked first. Plus, they have to know about the moving and stuff. Wouldn't the first instinct anyway be to call and see if they needed help or something? What was she supposed to do? Host while half their stuff is in boxes??? GTFOH. NTA", "NTA. I'm guessing your in-laws are overbearing and are used to getting their way, and that's why your rule exists. Some parents never accept that their children are adults and want to keep acting like the uber parents and standing up to them is disrespect. Rules and consequences like this often emerge from this kind of family dynamic.\n\nHonestly anyone who sticks their foot in the door and refuses to respect the homeowner's request to leave is in the wrong period. That's aggressive and confrontational even if it's a grandma doing it.", "I had to set this exact rule with both my Mom and Mil. Harsh rules are typically set for a reason, mine was because our mothers decided to wake us up the morning after our wedding. We were in bed. They sat on our bed. I guess that\u2019s my question for OP. OP, were these boundaries set for a very good reason or just because?", "NTA. If they'd called, it would have saved them the hour trip. What if you weren't home?", "NTA. They know the very reasonable rules you have.\n\nNext time don't even answer the door - pretend not to be home.", "NTA, they played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.", " My ass of an ex had a terrific answer to this situation:  tell them that you are sorry but you have an appointment to go to and need to leave.  And apologize that you can\u2019t entertain them and if they called beforehand, they would have found this out and saved themselves the trip.  Then you pick up your car keys and leave the house.", "NTA I don\u2019t really understand what the other judgements aren\u2019t getting. It is 2022 and technology is so advanced you can tell your phone to text someone for you. And your daughter wasn\u2019t even home wtf did they want from you lmao.", "NTA\n\nI dont' think they did drive over to see your daughter.  I think they drove over to try to exert dominance.  Are they thinking ahead to the holidays and want to be the king and queen of Christmas?  Are they threatened that your house move will somehow make you less accessible than you are now?  Whatever triggered them today, they wanted to show you they are the bosses, and you are just the kids.  \n\nAnd you and DH were AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Way to go, you.", "NTA-  all the people telling you  that you\u2019re overreacting have clearly never had to fight tooth and nail to have their boundaries respected . \n\nI grew up with family like this , and having them show up and me be expected to drop everything to entertain them was annoying af. \n\nYour MIL sticking her foot in the door in the door was her trying to bully you into submission. Good for you for standing your ground .\n\nI would have just ignored them and left them on the porch and let the embarrassment simmer and sink in  til they leave .", "NTA,  who drives over an hour without confirming the person (daughter) they want to see is available?  Sounds like the boundaries are in place for a reason.", "NTA. You have clear boundaries which they chose to ignore. They deserved what they got. What idiots drive an hour to see someone without checking first to see if they are even at home? I live three miles from my son and DIL who have my grandkids and I don't just drop by! It's called treating your adult children as adults.", "NTA. However, I feel like there's more to this rule that's being left out. I'm all up for the idea of setting rules and enforcing them, but this sounds like maybe, there was more than one unsavoury incident leading to it.", "NTA if they're aware of the rule and no memory issues they were testing that the rule didn't apply to them. Ya know because they're so special they thought their son would make an exception. Who drives an hour to drop in on someone unannounced? Refuse to leave? Then obstruct the door? No siree,  that door's gonna shut with or without your foot there, it might take a couple slams, but it's gonna shut. Don't leave when your kid you thought would grant exception doesn't, well now I understand why there rule was created.", "NTA. They knew the rule. They chose to break it and drive the hour to you.", "NTA\n\nWhen the in-laws said they had come to visit your daughter, you should have simply said she wasn't home and closed the door. This should have reinforced the idea that they needed to call first. However, you and your husband still might have needed to call the cops.", "NTA. That is a very valid boundary to have, and even though you took it to the extreme, they also did so by so blatantly refusing to leave.", "NTA - if they'd called, they'd have known the daughter wasn't home. You asked them to leave. \n\nWas your husband TA? Yeah, maybe, for calling the Sherrif.", "NTA. Personally I think this is so wrong on your part, but boundaries are boundaries and your boundaries are very clear and they were reminded of them multiple times, what did they want? To be let in and then you and your husband go back to doing whatever you normally do then they get mad for not being treated like welcome guests, once you said no and she physically stopped you from closing the door it was past the possibility of being a positive interaction.", "LOL, what? I found it funny that MIL put her foot down to prevent OP from closing the door. OP and DH put their foot down and literally called the police on them.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nThe kid wasn\u2019t even home!!!!", "NTA if they had time to drive an hour they had time to drop a text or make a call.  There is obviously history behind your edict, and you have to hold the line.", "NTA. Putting her foot in the door that someone is trying to shut (and has given a valid reason to) coupled with the fact that your husband already has issues with these people leads me to believe they are exactly the kind of people the rule was made for. While I myself might have offered them a drink or to sit for a moment I don't know your complete situation. You did say your house is not in good shape. What if there is no where to sit and there is no ability for you to host?  You were clear and they did not listen. They put themselves in this situation.", "Technically NTA. You have rules in your home and it should be respected.  Personally I was raised as a \"you here, good, let's party\". So this situation is very bizarre and I would never call the sheriff on my parents.", "NTA and for all the comments saying calling the cops was too far, what else were they supposed to do? They couldn\u2019t just close the door, it was being blocked. Should OP have broke MILs foot instead? Did y\u2019all miss where OP said the house wasn\u2019t guest ready regardless? It\u2019s not like they called the cops out of nowhere, the ILs were explicitly warned the consequences and didn\u2019t back down. Requesting people ask permission before arriving isn\u2019t even a far fetched request, I have that rule for my house and I don\u2019t know anyone who allows random pop ups either.", "my partner and i actually have the same rule for our home. we were homeless for months together and we value our space and privacy above all else. it\u2019s really accosting for us personally when people come over unannounced because we\u2019re completely unprepared. people might think it\u2019s a dumb rule, but it\u2019s your rule. you do not have to let anyone into your home that you don\u2019t want to be there.", "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more back ground here but seriously if you have to call the police it\u2019s time to go NC for both sides.  Their obviously is serious issues here and both sides should just stay away from each other. To have this kind of rule and have to call the police just get out of each other\u2019s lives.  Both sides need therapy.", "So, in the whole entire hour it took to drive, neither of them thought to have the non-driverbcall or send a text message, even though they know the rule? Huh. \n\nNta\n\nI have the same rule. Along with giving a rough eta, so we are home when guests arrive.", "NTA. People who don\u2019t respect the word no - to the point that police have to be called - had these types of rules created just for them", "NTA it's very easy to send a txt or a call if your InLaws wanted to come over. And to those who didn't read before posting  y t as and e s hs. They came over uninvited, to see your child who wasn't there, without calling, & while your working on moving out of your house. OP amd OP's husband asked them to leave and they were too selfish and entitled to accept their mistake and leave.", "NTA. Maybe they\u2019ll learn to respect boundaries next time.", "How bizarre, why wouldn't they leave. They sound insane! NTA", "NTA. Your MIL has some balls putting her foot in the door. It went too far but your in laws did it. Your hubby is a boss! Good on him for standing up. They fooled around and found out.", "Something tells me your in-laws are like my mom and 2 brothers. I can only imagine the things that they might have put you through. If that's the case, they have a solid history of disrespecting you, their son and all of your boundaries. So, if that's it, nta.\nIf this was a one time thing, I'd say yta. But I get the feeling this incident is just another in a long line of incidents.\nMy wife would have stomped on your mil's foot as soon as she tried to block the door.  I know this because my narcissist older brother pulled this trick on her. She didn't even blink, just stomped his foot as hard as she could, right where the toes meet the top. She was wearing her work boots. He had on sneakers. His screeching was glorious,  as was the sound of her slamming the door shut and locking it; followed be her using her \"drill instructor voice\" to tell him she said he wasn't welcome to come in and next time he pulled the foot in the door trick, she wouldn't pull her kick. I was torn between absolute shock and the urge to laugh hysterically. Because my older brother,  mom and younger brother are all narcissist,  self entitled nightmares. I'm still not sure how my middle brother turned out so nice. \nI guess I'm imagining your in-laws to be much the same.", "I think your boundary is extremely weird but they knew the boundary ahead of time and it should have been clear to them. NTA.", "They wanted to f around and they found out. NTA.", "NTA. They knew the rule, admitted to knowing the rule, and knew that you were in the process of moving. I have to wonder if you are moving farther away from them, and they had some idea of upsetting your daughter about it?", "Most people don\u2019t have rules like this for family. I\u2019m guessing there is a reason why the rule is in place. Since the in laws didn\u2019t leave the first time they were asked, makes me think there is a bad history. Who drives over an hour away for a surprise without a heads up? That\u2019s weird on their end or they knew the answer would be no haha", "NTA They\u2019ve clearly had an issue with boundaries before if you\u2019ve had to set this rule and they tried to force their way in. This is not the behaviour of respectful and caring parents. They purposefully didn\u2019t message you in advance to try to catch you out. \n\nYes calling the police is extreme but when they\u2019re being so pushy how else are you mean to get rid of them. Time to go NC or low contact", "NTA, the Y T A and E S H responses obviously have perfect families /s\n\nRules are rules for a reason. If your in laws can\u2019t follow the rules of your home, then they have to accept what comes of it when they break them.", "This can't be real.", "If you have that contact rule in place, I assume it\u2019s because you needed to set boundaries and they haven\u2019t been good at respecting them. NTA.", "Do they have a history of just showing up unannounced? You\u2019re entitled to your boundaries but it seems odd that things escalated to the point where you needed to call the cops. I\u2019m assuming your husband doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with them??", "NTA- I\u2019m not sure I woulda called the sheriff but if they had called first they wouldn\u2019t have driven an hour to see your daughter who wasn\u2019t even there so that\u2019s their own fault", "INFO\n\nIs this a one-time offense, or a repeating pattern?  If you went straight to orbital nukeage for an isolated incident, E S H with most of the A going to you; if they\u2019ve done this before, have had the rule clearly explained, and tried to assert dominance by ignoring it and forcing themselves into your home, N T A.", "Questions, do they compulsively try to impose without notice? Is this why you felt the need to be so draconian about this rule? None of this is normal; how did we get here?", "NTA.  I don\u2019t have that rule and if ppl come over unexpectedly, I won\u2019t answer the door.  Even for family.  Who does that these days?", "NTA and if they drove so far they definitely should have checked with you guys first", "NTA. They drove an hour to see your daughter, who wasn\u2019t even home. Which they would have known IF THEY HAD CALLED FIRST.", "NTA clearly the ILs don\u2019t respect yours or anybodies boundaries by lacking the ability to call ahead before showing up uninvited they even had an hour of driving to do it & they also would\u2019ve gotten their answer faster realizing the person they wanted to see wasn\u2019t even home. Its truly incredible the amount of YTAs and ESHs I see here with no proposed solutions. So I ask what else did you want them to do to get the message through to these repeatedly unwelcome boundary offenders?", "NTA, your husband is great. They suck.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nI have to deal with similar asshole in-laws who like to invite themselves over with no notice. Had to go NC because FIL threatened physical violence on his own son for no reason other than he was driving and didn't want to have a political discussion without being able to research context.", "NTA. Good for you. *applause*", "This is hard to swallow.", "I guess NTA because they crossed your boundary.\n\nI personally don't have such a rule but I also don't have a bunch of narcissistic pushy people in my life.", "Technically NTA but jesus your husband called the police on his parents because they showed up unannounced and didn\u2019t want to leave? I mean you have you boundaries and you stick to them but don\u2019t be surprised when people treat you like outcasts because of it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because I have a good relationship with the people around me but if someone I\u2019m supposed to love and treat like family showed up at my door unannounced, I\u2019d at least invite them in for a cup of tea or something. I\u2019m convinced that people on this sub treat every situation this black and white is because they have no real world experience or extremely negative experiences that have tainted their views of normal people.", "NTA.  They were intentionally trying to violate your boundaries.  They could have left at anytime but didn't so the cops were called.

Thankfully, my relatives have known this my whole life and respect my wishes.)", "NTA, they know the rule and you and your husband enforce it on both sides. An hour drive isn't even that long, but if they think it is then they should have had all their ducks in a row prior to making the trip. Don't make a long trip if you aren't 100% certain you are wanted there or allowed to be there. What if you hadn't been home at all? They had no way of knowing because they didn't even ask. Their refusal to leave is also not your problem or your fault, no means no and sometimes when a person can't accept that then they get the cops called on em.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\n\nBut more to the point, this isn\u2019t about them seeing your daughter. Either she\u2019s old enough for them to reach out to her directly and make plans (at which point she could have told them she\u2019s with her other grandma), or she\u2019s not old enough to do that and therefore seeing her has to be coordinated with HER PARENTS. Either way, it would be completely illogical for them to drive an hour to see her.\n\nNo, this is about trying to test your boundary because they think that they don\u2019t have to follow the rules.

Your husband took it too far by calling the police.\n\nThey suck for not checking before coming over given they knew your boundaries.", "Soooo, they knew the rule, drove an hour and on that wwwwhhhhhoooooolllllleeeeee drive the passenger couldn\u2019t be bothered to call you? NTA not at all.", "This is bananas level of boundaries but you do you I guess,  esh,  they should have left you should re-examine your choices,  as it applies to everyone it seems unlikely it\u2019s a specific issue with them", "I have to question why this rule is that important?  Calling the sheriff on your own parent's is an AH move.  I understand keeping boundaries but that is too extreme and I hope you gave them a better explanation than you posted here.", "ESH - I get that OP was upset about a clear boundary being broken, but to go as far as to call the police is a bit crazy. Especially since they\u2019re your in laws", "I mean, I get that it's your \"rule\", but geez... calling the police on your parents for visiting?? \n\nI can't reconcile someone who's not an AH doing that, so YTA.", "YTA.

Look I get they disrespected your boundaries. But they drove over an hour to see your family and your daughter.

This has been a fact since we got married and had kids. This applys to both sides of the family. \n\nSo today around 4:30, I hear a knock at the door and it turns out it's my in-laws. My husband isn't home at this point so I quickly call him to see if they'd talked to him about coming over. He says no they hadn't. I check my messages and missed calls and voicemail. They didn't call or next me either. I answer the door and ask them what they needed \n\nThey ask to see our daughter who isn't even home. She's at my mom's house visiting for the week since my husband and I are in that process of closing on a house and moving out of our rental home.  So we are not in any shape to receive guests. \n\nI ask them if they called or texted my husband or myself and they admit they had hadn't but they didn't see the issue since I was home. I remind them of our rule and tell them they need to leave. My FIL gets huffy saying they drove over an hour to see our daughter and they should be allowed in. \n\nI explained that I understand that but since they didn't check with us first they needed to leave. I go to close the door and my MIL puts her foot in the way to prevent the door from closing. At this point I'm getting extremely frustrated as I have other things I need to take care of. \n\nMy MIL explains that since it was such a long drive they should at least be let in for a few minutes to visit. At this point my husband comes home and my in laws are under the impression my husband will let them in. He doesn't. He tells them to leave and at this point they're trespassing. \n\nWe have a no trespassing sign on a tree by the house. It's clearly visible. My husband reminds them of our rule and tells them to leave. They refuse. My husband then tells them he has no choice but to call the police and have them removed from the property. \n\nMy in-laws think he's bluffing but my husband isn't a bluffer. He calls the sheriff and has his parents removed from the property. His parents are extremely upset saying we're assholes for not letting them break the rule. I do honestly feel a little bad since they did drive an hour to see our daughter. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because the people who caused you to set boundaries see that inch as a mile and know they can push and push. I can\u2019t tell you how mentally and emotionally taxing it is to have your boundaries take blow after blow.", "NTA. It's perhaps a bit unfriendly, like your strict policy, but people are allowed to have boundaries. My guess is the policy was put into place for a reason.

There\u2019s no context provided for why this rule exists but because it applies to both sides of the family, I\u2019m not going to just assume that both sides are boundary-pushing narcissists. I\u2019m questioning you both for why you literally could not let your in-laws in and felt the need to call the cops on them. I understand boundaries but there was no indication of actual harm from past experiences with both sides of the family. I would literally never call the cops on my parents or in-laws and my FIL is literally a narcissist. Is there a different culture that is part of this story? In my culture, people tend to not call and just show up. Other times they say they are coming and don\u2019t show up or come super late. Absent an abusive history with both sides of the family, I\u2019m shocked at this behavior. Like where is the human decency? Just because they inconvenience you a little bit, it\u2019s no reason to call the cops. Jeez.", "NTA at all.\nMy MIL would come to my husband's house when we were dating unannounced during the day knowing we worked nights.

I get that there are some familiy dynaminic that are cool with drop in's and that's him and his, but not me. I had to make him start locking the door because she would literally walk in on us having sex and act like it was no big deal. It got to the point I had to give my husband an ultimatum of either addressing it and making her call or text prior to visiting, or making her leave if she showed up unannounced, because I have PTSD from being SA'd by my step dad who felt he could just walk into my room whenever he pleased. It's not ok for anyone, ever. I don't care if it's your parents, his parents, or Jesus christ himself. Good for you for calling the cops.

They didn't bother to call before driving over an hour to see their granddaughter and she's not even there and then insist on coming in anyway? This sounds like a ridiculous power play on their part (I'm sure there's way more to this story, one has to wonder if it has to do with your anticipated move from the home) but they should know better than to test their son since apparently he does not make a habit of bluffing and is a big believer in FAAFO, which kudos to him for that.", "I mean...there are boundaries and then there is being so rigid you call the cops on your own parents?

They have just aggressively set boundaries for ANYONE coming to their house because they're a little paranoid about their personal space (in which case, this is just weird). \n\nI'd assume if the family had a history of violating their boundaries, OP would have mentioned it. Instead, the in-laws are showing up during a chaotic time with no warning after a long time looking for their grandchild. Is it because they have been cut off from seeing grandchild for a long time?
