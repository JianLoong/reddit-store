{"id": 6036, "submission_id": "zz24wu", "title": "AITA for complaining about my bridesmaid dress for my sister\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "I (f22) have just graduated from university and I\u2019m currently living half the time at home with my mom the other half in London while I\u2019m trying to find work as an actress. My sister (f26) has just gotten engaged. For context, my sister and I have always had a strained relationship, and I haven\u2019t seen her in person in 3 years (mostly due to covid, but also that she skipped a family vacation in Greece to hang out with her partner). She\u2019s always been very difficult, and she\u2019s ruined almost every event I\u2019ve had, by skipping both my high school and university graduations, as well as most of my plays or dance recitals. She even posted her engagement on Instagram before telling me.(There\u2019s a pretty big time difference as she lives in Canada and I found out via her post, which made me really upset.) Ever since then, she\u2019s been a bit of a bridezilla while planning her wedding and recently sent me perhaps the ugliest and most insulting bridesmaid dress I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m not kidding, it looked like a couch or curtains. It was also cheap (less than 100$), in a horrible colour, and an awful shape too. I also asked way at the beginning of her engagement for the dress to be any colour but orange (I have really cool pale skin and dark hair), and of course, it\u2019s bright orange with a velvet leaf pattern. My mother immediately agreed and said there\u2019s no way I\u2019m wearing that. Every single person has also been flabbergasted at her choice of dress. For context,  my sister has always been very competitive with me in relation to our appearances,  and with my mother too, who looks very young for her age and is very beautiful. My sister is beautiful too, and I\u2019ve never understood why she is sometimes determined to make sure I look horrible. My mom and I sent back more suitable dresses priced about 200-300$, but my sister said they are too expensive for the other bridesmaids. For context, my sister is getting her entire wedding paid for by our grandmother, so cost really shouldn\u2019t be an issue. There\u2019s also 10 months until the wedding, so plenty of time to find a new dress. In order to fix the dress situation, my mother suggested I pick out a dress in the same colour as the other bridesmaids and wear that instead, so I can feel comfortable at the wedding. While studying at university, I gained weight and had acne from stress, so now that I\u2019ve graduated and had time to relax, I\u2019ve lost all the weight/have great skin, and feel good again, so wearing a dress I feel beautiful in is very important to me too, as we rarely have family occasions and I\u2019m not wearing an ugly dress to the one event we have. I know my sister feels insecure about her appearance and I\u2019m trying to be sensitive to it, but I\u2019m also not going to allow her to dress me horribly to make her feel better. My sister flipped out and called me a spoiled brat and a piece of shit for wanting a different dress. I know the bride is \u201calways right\u201d, but at this point I don\u2019t even want to be a bridesmaid anymore! AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve tried multiple times to tell her I won\u2019t be a bridesmaid and instead attend as a guest, but she wouldn\u2019t have it, telling me I HAVE to be her bridesmaid. \n\nEdit 2: I also would never force her into a dress she didn\u2019t like, as she\u2019s very temperamental about her appearance. If I get married (wayyy it into the future lol) I would let her wear literally anything she wanted. Same with my graduation, my mom wore neon green and I thought she looked beautiful!! I think life is too short to force people to be uncomfortable for the sake of a photo or aesthetic.\n\nEdit 3: As for the graduation, she had promised to attend for 2 years and backed out last minute to go camping with her BF.\n\nThe dress for context, her pick:\nhttps://balticborn.com/collections/maxi-dresses/products/danielle-embossed-velvet-maxi-dress-rust?variant=41062736691365&nosto_source=cmp&nosto=1300816185\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nThe dress I suggested (the one you guys are saying is too revealing) was actually one she originally suggested months ago!

Seems like you and your mom feel like the wedding should be all about you.", "YTA. You are coming across as entitled. Her day, her way. Don't want to wear the dress, decline being a bridesmaid.", "YTA: it\u2019s one dress for one day. It\u2019s not about what you want. Further $ 100 is not cheap, but it is respectful of other peoples money. It\u2019s not so important that you feel pretty that your sister should change decisions to make you happy. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t be a bridesmaid.", "YTA.\nDon't like your dress? Don't like your sister?\nDrop out of the wedding party. Seriously!

Major AH behavior.", "YTA  - I doubt very much your sister has been spending her time scheming of ways to make you look bad at her wedding.  You seem like the one one looking for drama. \n\nIf your sister has multiple bridesmaids she\u2019s trying accommodate multiple body types and style preferences.  I don\u2019t love the color (maybe it\u2019s a fall wedding?) but the style seems fine even if it\u2019s not to your own personal tastes.  The alternative dress you proposed may not be at all suitable for the other bridesmaids.  Everybody has their own tastes, but it\u2019s a little slinky for the occasion IMO.  You are not supposed to be drawing attention to yourself at someone else\u2019s wedding.", "YTA. \n\nHer dress choice is fine and your \u2018offer\u2019 for one that\u2019s triple the cost for a slip dress- nah, not reasonable and not suitable for all body types. Just because you\u2019ve lost weight now and want to show off - her wedding is not that day. \n\nMost of your post was whining about your sister not celebrating every minor thing in your life - whereas you\u2019re not even willing to step back FOR HER WEDDING. Suck it up, be a decent sister and wear her choice - let her wedding day be about her, not you pushing into the spotlight.", "YTA.  Bride picks the dress, and that dress is cute as hell", "YTA the dress is stunning I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with it. Your moms reaction makes it seem like you\u2019re the golden child who can do no wrong.", "YTA\n\n\n\nEnd of the day....it's not your wedding ...it's hers. You don't get to tell her and all the other bridesmaids what they can or can't wear.\n\nJust drop out of being bridesmaid and go as a guest only. It's that simple OP. Or don't go at all. Not sure why you're making a huge fuss for a sister you don't like. Just sounds like you're butthurt about her not going to your graduation and the engagement.... this is just payback.... I mean she lives in Canada and you are in the UK.... That's a huge distance and time difference especially if she's in western part of Canada. That's going to affect traveling and talking OP. With your distain for each other...come on...be real OP.\n\nYou and your sister are both drama llamas.\n\nEdit to add.. the dress she picked is nice looking and different. It's not some hideous ball gown sack you wrote about. The one you picked isn't even the same color family and is a vastly different style and costs 3x. Your grandma paying is a bullshit excuse... Obviously no one wants her to, pay 3x as much for all the dresses..and that if she is even paying for them .. cause it sounds like the bridesmaids are doing that part and said NO.", "YTA, That dress is literally fine, if you're such a baby about how you look don't agree to be a bridesmaid.", "INFO: Are all the bridesmaids wearing the same dress?", "Honestly, I love that dress. I can see how it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s taste, but it\u2019s entirely possible she\u2019s not choosing it just to troll you. Especially seeing as it\u2019ll be an October wedding (I assume, based on stated timeline), those fall colors might be perfectly seasonal. \n\nIt\u2019s nice when bridesmaids get a dress they love, but wearing an ugly bridesmaid dress is a time-honored tradition at this point. Wear the dress or don\u2019t stand up in the wedding. YTA.", "INFO: Is your grandmother insanely rich, as you say money (her money) doesn't matter?", "YTA. She can\u2019t make you be a bridesmaid.  Drop out and stop insisting on your dress preference.  It\u2019s not about you.", "YTA \nSorry. But I think your suggestion is even worse\u2026it looks more like a night-dress type of dress. And 300$ for that slip of fabric is over the top. \nEven if you dont like it, its not your wedding. And I think there is more to the story than you describe. After readying how your mother choose your side shows that you were probably the Favorite/Golden child. The bridesmaids dress is not the most modern one but its HER choice. NOT YOURS. You sound entitled and rude.", "YTA\n\nWho the hell cares if a bridesmaid dress is ugly, you only have to wear it for a couple hours. Especially if it's cheap too\n\n>my mother suggested I pick out a dress in the same colour as the other bridesmaids and wear that instead\n\nGreat! Can't wait to see you get roasted over at r/weddingshaming", "YTA. Your complaints against your sister seem petty. So your 16 year old sister didn't go to her 12 year old sisters plays... how exactly did that ruin the event for you? She was excited and announced her engagement on social media without waiting for the appropriate time zone to call you? You're more worried about what she's doing than what you're doing with your own life. \n\nSo the bridesmaids dress isn't what you like. It looks like it would be flattering on multiple sizes of bridesmaids, where the one you want would not work for most women. It's also budget friendly for everyone. Most bridesmaids don't love their dresses, stop trying to make her wedding about you.", "Yikes, ESH. I get that it's annoying, but the problem you're describing is literally so common that movies have been made about the bad bridesmaids dress. Also, have you seen dress styles lately? It's like the 80s made a comeback on acid. So it's not unthinkable that this dress is perfectly on-trend despite sounding hideous. \n\nYour sister sounds difficult and I get why you have a strained relationship. But you're coming across a little entitled too (especially blowing off cost like that). And as much as you want to look hot, your sister's wedding isn't really your time to shine. Your mom's compromise is ridiculous. So yeah, the whole lot of you need to grow up.", "Honestly while I wouldn\u2019t pick that bridesmaid dress, it\u2019s not that bad- I\u2019ve seen way worse. When you\u2019re a bridesmaid you just have to suck it up and wear what the bride picks. If it bothers OP that much she should just stand on her refusal to be a bridesmaid, her sister can\u2019t force her to do it. \n\nYTA", "For what its worth, I think its a pretty dress and its not an unreasonable ask for her wedding day.

Bridesmaids wear the dress without complaining. \n\nFunny how you complain it's only 100, when I'm pretty sure you would also complain if it was super expensive. \n\nIf you plan to get married in the future, I'm sure you will want to choose things for your wedding without everyone chiming in with negativity and contrary opinions. \n\nI have brothers and have never wanted a sister.

Your sister is getting married. \n\nShe chooses a cheap dress. \n\nBut because it's orange, you are throwing a fit? \n\nI am not a huge fan of bright colors (sensitive eyes, bright colors literally make my eyes burn) and I had to wear a bright purple outfit a wedding once as the last minute addition to the bridal party. My solution? I avoided mirrors to the extreme but to get through the day. Did I hate the outfit? Yes. Did I still wear it? Also yes. Why? Because I was asked to and I went with it. \n\nSo yeah. If I can do that, so can you. Op, the biggest YTA I have seen today", "YTA. You're the actress, pretend you love your sister and wear the fucking dress she picked out or don't be her bridesmaid.

Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to make your grandma pay for her bridesmaids dresses. Regardless politely decline if it\u2019s not your taste and back out of the position.

Seriously that\u2019s the rudest choice you could suggest.", "YTA \u2014 Not your wedding, number one. \n\nTwo, your sister picked a cute dress. Your dress looks like underwear (and I don\u2019t know where your sister is getting married, but if it\u2019s in a church, you probably can\u2019t wear that). \n\nMaybe you\u2019re not paying for your dress, but most of the other bridesmaids likely are. Under $100 is a general rule of thumb as a courtesy to them.", "YTA for your focus on the price of the dress, it makes you sound like a snob but also your Me Me Me attitude. Sure tell her you don\u2019t like the dress and maybe see if she\u2019s open to suggestions but if it\u2019s the dress the other bridesmaids chose you might be SOL. Also just because grandma is paying doesn\u2019t mean your sister is wanting to bankrupt her", "YTA\n\nThat dress is really cute. You tried to suggest double and triple prices for the dresses, when the other bridesmaids can't afford them. \n\nETA: I just saw the dress you wanted to wear and it's basically a nightgown. It would look horrible on most people. Your sister's pick is much nicer and more appropriate.", "YTA- west the dress and stop making everything about you. It doesn\u2019t matter if you think it\u2019s pretty or not. I wore a shockingly ugly (strapless, green, drop waist, polyester with silver shoes) dress as a bridesmaid and didn\u2019t complain at all because it\u2019s not about me, and I was happy to support a friend.

Stick to your no if you don't want to do it. That dress isn't the most terrible one I have seen (US in the 80s. Enough said.), but it takes the right person to pull it off.

How? I\u2019m genuinely confused.", "NTA. Normally I would say it\u2019s about the couple getting married and these things are their choice and you just have to deal with it. Is the dress that bad? Because surely as a bridesmaid you would be in a lot of pictures does she really want someone in a terrible dress in pictures? If you do feel that she is doing it to make herself look better then can you drop out of being a bridesmaid and just be a guest?

Get the photos done and change", "ESH\n\nThe bridesmaids dress she chose was definitely taste specific; it's one of those \"you love it or hate it\" kinds of things.\n\nIt sounds like she chose your dress to be spiteful which makes her TA, but at the same time, you as a part of the wedding party were given bad advice by your mother to just wear something else. That's not proper etiquette and you would be TA if you chose to show up in a dress she didn't agree on.\n\nThat being said, you have every right to back out of being a bridesmaid and wear your own dress. Your self esteem is important, but it wouldn't be fair to use that to overshadow her plans. But if you really want to be in the wedding party, you may have to wear the dress she chose. So it's a personal decision as to the lesser of two evils.\n\nTo anyone saying \"bridesmaids don't have a right to complain about their dress\" - that's wrong. You can absolutely complain about the dress, but if you love the person who's getting married more than you hate the dress, then you suck it up and wear it. My half sister stuck us in watermelon bubble dresses with bright blue eyeshadow up to our eyebrows. We wore it (and hated it) but did it because we loved her.\n\nAlso, sometimes you may change your mind when you see the full picture. My friends from college did a rainbow themed wedding and put us all in a color from the rainbow. I got put in yellow and I hated yellow. I usually look awful in yellow.

Your sister does sound like a piece of work. But, sorry, it isn't your wedding and you don't get to choose the bridesmaid's dress if the bride wants to pick them. It isn't your event to feel beautiful. It's not your wedding. Now, of course, a reasonable person would want their wedding party to feel good about themselves and to feel good about the choice of dress. Obviously, your sister isn't reasonable, hence my judgment that everyone sucks. Still, you agreed to be a bridesmaid, you wear the dress your sister wants you to wear. You said yourself it was a cheap one, so it isn't like she's making you pay a ton of money for the dress.\n\nAre all the bridesmaids wearing the same dress?
