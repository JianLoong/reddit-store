{"id": 17311, "submission_id": "13id7lx", "title": "AITA for telling my husband I\u2019m not buying his mom a Mother\u2019s Day gift anymore?", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve (26F) been with my husband (29M) for six years and have bought his mom a gift every year since we\u2019ve been together. I\u2019m now a mom of two year old twins (their only grandchildren) and usually dread the interactions with her on this specific day. Since my husband and I have had our own family he does not gift MIL anything for Mother\u2019s Day. For that reason, I buy her a gift and say it\u2019s from us just so she won\u2019t feel forgotten or have any hurt feelings. \n\nThis year I was a little tight on money but I was still able to get her a card with a very thoughtful note, See\u2019s chocolates, and a B&BW candle (she loves chocolates and candles). So we go over and have my daughters give her the gift, she immediately looks at hubby and says thank you to him. Then, she tells FIL to give me my gift. I say thank you and open it in front of them only to see that she gifted me a burnt candle she didn\u2019t like (I know this because she had it on her vanity for a long time) and a candle she couldn\u2019t see on her IG business page. NOW, don\u2019t get me wrong I know it\u2019s the thought that counts and I\u2019m not a materialistic person but that is exactly why it\u2019s so rude and hurtful. The lack of thought and care is so frustrating because she\u2019s not my mother and gets more than what she gives. She could\u2019ve just given me a card and wrote something in it and I would\u2019ve genuinely appreciated it. Anyway, I told hubby that from now on he was in charge of her gifts because I was not going to waste my time and efforts.\n\n\nP.S. it\u2019s not a one time thing, last year I made her a whole gift basket with supplies for her garden, a card, and of course her chocolates and candles. Again, she looks only at hubby and tells him thank you after I handed it to her. She in turn told me that the plant sitting on her table was for me(a orchid she bought that same day from her job). Never been a big plant person so idk.

The lack of thought and care\" Don't kid yourself: She put a LOT of thought into snubbing you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo make a new rule: If youre husband wants MIL to get a gift, HE will have to buy it.", "NTA, and not sure why you were handling Mother's Day gifting for his mother in the first place.", "NTA. The best rule you can implement going forward is: you deal with your family of origin, I\u2019ll deal with mine. \n\nThat means he\u2019s on the hook for gifts, remembering to reach out for bdays/holidays/anniversaries, etc. If he doesn\u2019t do it, oh well. \n\nLastly, you didn\u2019t really specify, but if you are having to plan/prepare your own Mother\u2019s Day or bday because he doesn\u2019t do anything, then start matching his energy. If he can\u2019t put thought into you, you don\u2019t put thought into him.", "NTA\n\nIf your mother-in-law is such a big fan of plants, she should know that you only reap what you sow. She clearly doesn't care about making gestures so maybe not getting them will show her how it feels.", "NTA! Monster in laws are why when you become a parent, they then celebrate grandparents day, meaning mother's day is about you...the active mother", "NTA\n\nTime to pass this duty on to husband. She's being intentionally rude. If he chooses not to get her anything nice, she'll learn pretty fast who was picking out all those nice gifts!", "Absolutely NTA!!!\n\nI'm not sure what goes on in your marriage, so please don't be upset with me asking further questions....\n\nHave you spoken to your husband about this? \n\nHas he ever confronted his mom?\n\nDoes your MIL know the gifts are your planning?\n\nDo you think your MIL does not like you?\n\nI ask all this because these are key questions. You and your husband need to be a united front. My husband used to take credit for things because he didn't see the big deal until we had a long talk about it. I asked how he would feel if he spent a lot of time and effort on a project at work, and his partner, who did nothing, got all the credit? Putting it in that perspective helped him understand, and now when someone thanks him, he always does his best to have my back. \n\nAlso, I ask if your MIL does not like you because it sounds like she is being passive-aggressive. Like, \"I got you a horrible gift, but you can't say anything because I got you something, and if you complain, I can call you ungrateful.\" It is like she is trying to set you up to have an argument, and to be honest, your husband should not be ok with that. He should be the one to take his mom off to the side and say something. You are being put in a very uncomfortable and unfair spot.\n\nI'm so sorry this is what you are going through. Just know you are an amazing person, wife, and daughter in law for putting up with so much of this. I hope it gets better for you. You don't deserve this.", "YTA..  she does it once...ok...she does it twice then forget her.

I have old posts of some situations we were dealing with. \n\nMy husband is aware, we talk about everything. He\u2019s had to confront her on other topics but he never has on this one just because it feels so petty. \n\nMy MIL knows my husband is not that thoughtful lol and plus the cards are always in my writing. \n\nI absolutely do not think MIL likes me. My husband had girlfriends in the past but never anything serious. Mix that with her being super territorial/possessive..", "How exactly does that make me the AH? I\u2019m not arguing that, I\u2019m just wanting to understand. I feel as I might be the AH for telling my husband something but not necessarily for still including her in my gift giving.", "Exactly! She knows my husband is not that thoughtful or would even put the effort into doing that. He\u2019s a sweet man but has a very hard time standing up for himself and I."]}
