I say thank you and open it in front of them only to see that she gifted me a burnt candle she didn\u2019t like (I know this because she had it on her vanity for a long time) and a candle she couldn\u2019t see on her IG business page.

Anyway, I told hubby that from now on he was in charge of her gifts because I was not going to waste my time and efforts.\n\n\nP.S. it\u2019s not a one time thing, last year I made her a whole gift basket with supplies for her garden, a card, and of course her chocolates and candles.

You and your husband need to be a united front. My husband used to take credit for things because he didn't see the big deal until we had a long talk about it. I asked how he would feel if he spent a lot of time and effort on a project at work, and his partner, who did nothing, got all the credit? Putting it in that perspective helped him understand, and now when someone thanks him, he always does his best to have my back. \n\nAlso, I ask if your MIL does not like you because it sounds like she is being passive-aggressive. Like, \"I got you a horrible gift, but you can't say anything because I got you something, and if you complain, I can call you ungrateful.\" It is like she is trying to set you up to have an argument, and to be honest, your husband should not be ok with that. He should be the one to take his mom off to the side and say something. You are being put in a very uncomfortable and unfair spot.\n\nI'm so sorry this is what you are going through. Just know you are an amazing person, wife, and daughter in law for putting up with so much of this. I hope it gets better for you.

Still the only of her kids to take her to doctor's appointments despite the retired golden son who lives much closer to her. One of the reasons why she treats him badly was because he married my mum, yet 30 years later, my mum still wants to bend over backwards for her & forces my dad to do the same.

Stop giving AF and you will feel so much better. NTA.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you should have been buying it in the first place. I have the opposite issue to you in that I refuse to buy gifts for my husbands side of the family and the things he chooses, I definitely would not but his mum thanks me for them. I want to say \u201cthere\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d be buying that tacky gift\u201d lol.", "NAH but I think it would be a nice thing for your kids to continue to be part of gift giving to their Grandma. \n\nAlso, in the 38 years since my son was born I have never received a gift or card from my mother for mother's day, and it literally never occurred to me to expect one, since I am not her mother. Yet I always ensured my son sent her a card since she is my mom and his grandma. \n\nI think it is rude for your MIL to get you a used gift for a present, but it seems somewhat strange to me that you expect a present from her, as she is your husband's mother. \n\nIt does make sense for your husband to continue to give his mother a present, since she didn't stop being his mother just because he became a father. It would really hurt me if my son stopped giving me a card and flowers for mother's day just because he got married had and children, but I know he would never do that. He will always be my son and I will always be his mom.", "NTA. Yes, it is the thought that counts. I love when people say that to someone who has just received a crappy gift. Anyone who gives you a used candle that they disliked obviously doesn't think much of you!!! Of course the ultimate insult is that when you hand MIL her gift, she looks straight at your husband to thank him.\n\nDefinitely leave the gift buying for MIL to your husband. But what do you want to bet that somehow you will be blamed for her not receiving one, because of course it is the wife who has to do these things.", "NTA - why don\u2019t you go ahead and show her this post?", "NTA.", "NTA you never should\u2019ve. That\u2019s his responsibility.", "Info- why do you keep doing it? sounds like your husband has made an active choice to not give her gifts, so why are you when she treats you this way? sounds\nlike you need to follow his lead", "Lol NTA.  Let your hubby figure things out.", "NTA - do not waste your time, energy and efforts on your MIL.  She's sounds dreadful.  Please put your lovely and kind energy towards a friend or another relative that will reciprocate.  These people with the emotional space of a black hole really need to stop sucking up the good energy of good people.  Time to say no to AHs.", "NTA. His mom, his problem.", "NTA but your husband sure is.", "You should maybe post/read R/JUSTNOMIL to see if any of those posts resonate with you", "i mean... considering how you've described his mother\u2014 maybe that's intentional, bud.", "Mother's day is a completely different date where my MIL lives so we always forget it. I feel like it's my fault, even though no one has ever said that it was."]}
