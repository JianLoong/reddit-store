For example, if I am in the kitchen doing something and step out for a few moments. I hate if I came back and someone has \"cleaned up\" after me. Unless obviously something was in the way or they needed to use something. But I hate when people don't just mind their business and leave stuff how it was. I hated when I lived at home and my mom would tidy up my room when I wasn't around. Nothing crazy but say I left a shirt hanging on my bed frame. I know exactly where that shirt is. Now I am coming back looking for it and it's in a new spot. I ask my mom, she doesn't remember where she put it etc etc. I just am a big believer in minding my own business. I strongly dislike if I am making something in the oven and have a timer set and it goes off and someone takes it out right away and turns the oven off. Usually I want to leave it in a bit longer or maybe that was just the first step and it needed to be checked on. Even if that was the time for it to be taken out. I would much rather people just mind their own things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I extend this courtesy to others and its very much in my nature to mind my own business. Usually what other people are doing isn't on my radar and people point out how I am usually in my \"own world\" a lot. My roommate(22f) on the other hand is the complete opposite. She has to be part of everything. If I'm watching something, she asks what I'm watching. If I look at my phone and laugh she asks why I'm laughing etc. It's not a problem. A lot of my friends are like this and I don't find it annoying, it can be endearing. She's like this with everyone. But she grew up in a big household whereas I was an only child so she has some different tendencies. She can be absent minded and easily distracted. She'll almost expect people around her to be watching out for her. She'll have water boiling on the stove and wander to another room. Also she has the annoying(to me) tendency to \"clean up\" after me or other people that are in the apartment\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was baking cookies in the oven and I was in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal. I was also wearing airpods. She left the kitchen for a while and eventually I heard the oven going off faintly through the airpods but it wasn't my business. Eventually she came rushing into the room and took the cookies out. They weren't burnt to the point where they smelled but her chewy cookies were solid. She told me I should have heard the oven and took them out. I told her if that's what she wanted she should have told me to listen for the oven and I would take them out and that you can't just assume someone will.

In fact, the long preamble makes me wonder if there's a bit of an ESH ruling in order here.  Have you told her in concise and direct terms, without blame, that you live on different terms from her and could use some space and clear communication?", "YTA\n\ncmon mannnnn, you heard the alarm. it takes absolutely no effort to say \"yo, the thing is doing a thing\"\n\ni mean, i guess you dont really HAVE to do ANYTHING for ANYONE, EVER and just \"mind your business\" but thats highly anti-social behavior but I guess if everyone thinks your an aloof jerk you won't have to worry about people being in your business or vice versa", "INFO \n\nHave you ever spoken with her about this? \n\nIt sounds like just different styles, but you would be TA if you just expect her to read your mind.", "You could, at the very least, take the cookies out or inform her the timer went off. Yes, she was careless and thoughtless, but it would\u2019ve required no effort on your part. It's the polite thing to do. \n\nHowever, if you didn't hear the timer because the noise was faint through your AirPods, then you're not at fault. She's entirely to blame.", "I have a question for OP... say you had your bathroom in your room and you accidentally left the water running and went on the road, and your room began flooding.

I'm leaning towards YTA.", "YTA, u couldn\u2019t just let them know? do everyone a favor: live alone. some people can\u2019t handle having roommates, and u sound like one of them \ud83d\ude2c", "You need to communicate your boundaries and encourage communication from her.", "YTA, and I strongly suggest you dedicate your life to earning more money so you can live on your own, angrily.

You know she doesn\u2019t find it disrespectful to get involved with her stuff, so your opinion about people getting involved with *your* stuff doesn\u2019t really matter here. Knowing she wouldn\u2019t find it disrespectful if you said something or took them out of the oven, you still chose not to help - and it\u2019s not like you\u2019d have to actually take them out, just saying \u201coven is beeping\u201d would\u2019ve been considerate and helpful. Sure you aren\u2019t obligated to do that and it\u2019s not your job, but it\u2019s the courteous thing to do, so that\u2019s why I think YTA. \n\nIf you hadn\u2019t heard the alarm, I\u2019d say NTA, but you did. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart or safe for her to leave the room with water boiling or stuff in the oven, and maybe you should talk to her about that, but if that ever happens in my house, we just inform the other person to remind them out of courtesy and consideration. In the future, you should probably tell her you don\u2019t ever plan to help her out with these kinds of things, so she\u2019ll know what to expect from you and plan accordingly.", "You just sound exhausting in general, so I'm surprised to find myself typing NTA ...this time.\n\nI have a feeling there's (many) other times where you're not so lucky.", "NAH\n\nBoth you and she have ways of interacting with alarms and ovens that work, but they're not compatible.

Extra crispy cookies are the best-case scenario.", "YTA\n\nYou seem to be unpleasant to be around in general.", "YTA all that stuff at the beginning isnt necessary, you should have let her know the timer went off its not that hard.", "Sooooo if the kitchen caught on fire\u2026would you still be minding your own business?", "Did she not hear the alarm? Wtf did she think she was doing walking away?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  There are alarms on phones.  If you really have to walk away from cookies in the oven, you set the alarm on your phone and take it with you so you'll hear it.  If you think you won't be able to be back in time, you ask for help or you wait until you can take care of it.", "NTA\u2026I totally get it and also I get irritated when someone tells me the timers went off\u2026especially when I\u2019m in the same room/house.

That being said, if you haven\u2019t had an explicit conversation about how you operate as far as \u201cminding your own business\u201d you\u2019re reaching into AH territory.

It\u2019s not an insult\u2014but your post seems to indicate a few things that may be symptoms, such as having a specific way you like things to be, being inflexible in people disturbing your patterns, space, or routine, applying your own thoughts about the way things \u201cshould be\u201d to other people even though you say you recognize they are different (you cognitively seem to understand that she thinks differently but you can\u2019t seem to think or understand from her perspective), and not picking up on certain social cues.\n\nBecause I am reading deeply into what you are saying, I\u2019m going to say NTA because I feel like calling you an asshole is too far for just ignoring a timer that maybe you shouldn\u2019t have.  To be clear, I don\u2019t think it was the \u201ccorrect choice\u201d to ignore it but I think there is something else going on here that is preventing you from understanding why this wasn\u2019t the correct choice and I\u2019m not going to call you an asshole for that.", "Exactly! How hard would it have been to yell out \u201ctimer went off\u201d", "Because the \"long preamble\"(two paragraphs so long) is important. I see not messing with other people's things as respect. But hey, I could be the asshole. That's why I'm here", "I just assume other people got whatever they are working on. I see not getting involved(unless asked) as showing respect.", "As an only child that grew up with parents that worked a lot and late. I faced most of these things alone. I've been in situations similar to what you mentioned. Left the water running or left something on. So if my roommate didn't turn it off I wouldn't feel any kind of way. It was my fault. Now if I left water running, remembered, called my roommate  who was home and asked her to turn it off. Then I would feel a way if she didn't turn it off.", "Explain why? Because it's not their business if no one asked.", "Cookies take like 10 mins, idk where this girl went with cookies in the oven", "When we were kids, if we heard a timer go off, one of us would run to the center of the house and yell \"beep\" very loudly. It was the quickest way to alert anyone home.", "See?  You said it all in one sentence. \"I see not messing with other people's things as respect.\"  That's what you need to tell her and all your flatmates, along with the tolerance you showed for her background helping to explain her behavior in your mind but not spoken. Maybe just saying something to them all at the same time like, \"we're all coming from different expectations of the best way to live with other people, I like you guys, and I'd like to just lay it out why I let the cookies cook past the timer.  If you want me to do something, ask me directly.\"  Sounds like she might also be a bit of a shite-stirrer so you want to say it to all of them.  And to be clear -- you have a right to that attitude of not messing with people's things as respect.  I have the exact same attitude and would have been really happy if you'd been my roommate or flatmate.  The question, to me, is do you want to be friends with your flatmates or just live with them while you have to and then move on?  If good relationships or even friendships are the goal/s, then being clear and kind is your best strategy.  Your generation is going through hell with tons of mixed signals and too much data pouring into their brains all the time.

What you see as respectful is not what most people see as respectful. Most people would recognize that water left running when the person isn\u2019t home is out of the ordinary and something that should be turned off so as no it to ruin things/cost extra money etc. Most people would view turning off the water as helpful and generally appreciated not as disrespectful.", "Okay, I get you. Just wanted to make sure you were consistent right through. Going to say NTA.\n\nTbh, it's weird, probably because I grew up differently. But, if that's how you are, that's how you are.", "Because maybe they do. I just generally assume other adults have their things under control", "given you had to explain sooo much how the way you behave is actually respectful because your mum used to pick up for you and it was annoying .

Respect: cookies were not in the oven. she forgot to put them in, you leave them there as you don\u2019t know why she left them out.
