For example, if I am in the kitchen doing something and step out for a few moments. I hate if I came back and someone has \"cleaned up\" after me. Unless obviously something was in the way or they needed to use something. But I hate when people don't just mind their business and leave stuff how it was. I hated when I lived at home and my mom would tidy up my room when I wasn't around. Nothing crazy but say I left a shirt hanging on my bed frame. I know exactly where that shirt is. Now I am coming back looking for it and it's in a new spot. I ask my mom, she doesn't remember where she put it etc etc. I just am a big believer in minding my own business. I strongly dislike if I am making something in the oven and have a timer set and it goes off and someone takes it out right away and turns the oven off. Usually I want to leave it in a bit longer or maybe that was just the first step and it needed to be checked on. Even if that was the time for it to be taken out. I would much rather people just mind their own things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I extend this courtesy to others and its very much in my nature to mind my own business. Usually what other people are doing isn't on my radar and people point out how I am usually in my \"own world\" a lot. My roommate(22f) on the other hand is the complete opposite. She has to be part of everything. If I'm watching something, she asks what I'm watching. If I look at my phone and laugh she asks why I'm laughing etc. It's not a problem. A lot of my friends are like this and I don't find it annoying, it can be endearing. She's like this with everyone. But she grew up in a big household whereas I was an only child so she has some different tendencies. She can be absent minded and easily distracted. She'll almost expect people around her to be watching out for her. She'll have water boiling on the stove and wander to another room. Also she has the annoying(to me) tendency to \"clean up\" after me or other people that are in the apartment\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was baking cookies in the oven and I was in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal. I was also wearing airpods. She left the kitchen for a while and eventually I heard the oven going off faintly through the airpods but it wasn't my business. Eventually she came rushing into the room and took the cookies out. They weren't burnt to the point where they smelled but her chewy cookies were solid. She told me I should have heard the oven and took them out. I told her if that's what she wanted she should have told me to listen for the oven and I would take them out and that you can't just assume someone will.

It\u2019s not an insult\u2014but your post seems to indicate a few things that may be symptoms, such as having a specific way you like things to be, being inflexible in people disturbing your patterns, space, or routine, applying your own thoughts about the way things \u201cshould be\u201d to other people even though you say you recognize they are different (you cognitively seem to understand that she thinks differently but you can\u2019t seem to think or understand from her perspective), and not picking up on certain social cues.\n\nBecause I am reading deeply into what you are saying, I\u2019m going to say NTA because I feel like calling you an asshole is too far for just ignoring a timer that maybe you shouldn\u2019t have.

I've been in situations similar to what you mentioned. Left the water running or left something on. So if my roommate didn't turn it off I wouldn't feel any kind of way. It was my fault. Now if I left water running, remembered, called my roommate  who was home and asked her to turn it off. Then I would feel a way if she didn't turn it off.", "Explain why? Because it's not their business if no one asked.", "Cookies take like 10 mins, idk where this girl went with cookies in the oven", "When we were kids, if we heard a timer go off, one of us would run to the center of the house and yell \"beep\" very loudly. It was the quickest way to alert anyone home.", "See?  You said it all in one sentence. \"I see not messing with other people's things as respect.\"  That's what you need to tell her and all your flatmates, along with the tolerance you showed for her background helping to explain her behavior in your mind but not spoken. Maybe just saying something to them all at the same time like, \"we're all coming from different expectations of the best way to live with other people, I like you guys, and I'd like to just lay it out why I let the cookies cook past the timer.  If you want me to do something, ask me directly.\"  Sounds like she might also be a bit of a shite-stirrer so you want to say it to all of them.  And to be clear -- you have a right to that attitude of not messing with people's things as respect.  I have the exact same attitude and would have been really happy if you'd been my roommate or flatmate.  The question, to me, is do you want to be friends with your flatmates or just live with them while you have to and then move on?  If good relationships or even friendships are the goal/s, then being clear and kind is your best strategy.  Your generation is going through hell with tons of mixed signals and too much data pouring into their brains all the time.

I would hate to live with you", "Team NAH here. \n\nI\u2019m the same way when it comes to not wanting people to interfere with what I\u2019m doing. It messes with my brain and drives me up a wall. If I\u2019m doing a thing it\u2019s because I want it done my way. TBH if I don\u2019t care how a thing is done, I\u2019m likely to ask someone else to do it. \n\nI also think she\u2019s NTA either. She\u2019s just different from you. You and I would probably be compatible roommates.  I think you\u2019re doing pretty well to put up with her. She seems totally fine but would be difficult for me to live with. \n\nThat said, as my husband loses his hearing I\u2019m learning more and more to not mind my own business. If I hear a timer going off I tap him on the shoulder and call his attention to it. I come behind him and turn faucets off and only rarely do I annoy him because he left it running on purpose; usually it\u2019s because he can\u2019t hear it so he forgets about it. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible for you to learn to work with each other\u2019s differences. Maybe you can come to an agreement that she will alert you to a timer instead of taking your stuff out of the oven, and will let you know if she wants you to keep an ear out for her timer. Try y", "OP, is there any chance that you are neurodivergent?  Either way I think your perspective mostly makes sense when you explain it but doesn't when you don't.

If you don\u2019t want other people answering your alarms, you should not leave your food unattended.\nSame goes for her", "NTA. She put cookies in the oven which are at most 15 minutes, some as little as 5 depending on size. Why was she wondering so far from the oven when she out something in?? \n\nI would make sure to communicate with her, though that you will not remove something from the oven unless specifically asked to. Communication is usually a good thing.", "If someone is cooking it's 100% on the person cooking to not walk away from the stove/oven. They are solely responsible for managing timers and making sure things don't burn. She didn't even ask you to keep an eye on it.

She sounds irresponsible.   She needs people to stop enabling her", "NTA - I've had many roommates who do stuff like this. Not your problem.", "Nta, if you knew the cookies were gonna burn you would've taken them out. You partially gave the long preamble to point out that you simply were not paying attention to her baking and had no idea what she was doing. You heard the beep and dismissed it, assuming she'd be back in time anyway.  Then just forgot about it and put it out of your mind because it wasn't your business \n\nI wouldn't dare yell at a roommate for not taking my cookies out of the oven. That's 100% her own fuckup lol. But it seems like you guys are on pretty good terms and even though you're really different you can still handle or even appreciate her asking about your funny videos and trying to chat all the time. Being friends with roommates was one of the best experiences of my 20s, really even in my life.  I would apologize to her and explain that you are just different from her and don't pay attention to other people's stuff, and thought she had the cookies covered. Of course if you knew they were burning you would have taken them out. \n\nOn the point of the preamble, you might reconsider adjusting your attitude around people cleaning up after you too. If people are tidying rooms when you leave, it's because they don't want to sit or work in clutter.  In a shared space especially, one item begets more items. I'm sure that was your mother's impulse when she sees a shirt or shoes out.  Annoying as it was for her to go through your room as an adult, most of what she knows about you is having to attend to your every need and you being totally helpless as a child. It was easier for her to pick up one item at a time rather than wait for the entire room to explode with your shit, and therefore this is her habit.  For your roommate, she likely feels the same.  As soon as one person throws a coat down, 5 people do. Putting small items away or folding stuff up is a compromise.  They get a nice clean space, you don't get nagging or resentment directed your way, theoretically everyone can win", "YTA. It takes very little effort to call out to her that the timer went off. Doesn't even require you to leave your chair.", "YTA, because it\u2019s so unnecessary to antagonize the people you live with in situations where it would be so easy not to just by using a little common sense.", "YTA for the simple reason that you would rather make a point than be momentarily inconvenienced on principle. I very much dislike people like you and avoid them at all costs at work. \n\nWhen you have a roommate you do things for each other. You don\u2019t have to take the food out but if you hear a timer and she didn\u2019t you say something. This feels like it\u2019s punitive because she cleaned up in the kitchen and you didn\u2019t want her to. Most people clean as they go. You should try it. Quit keeping score or you\u2019re gonna have a bad time.", "You don\u2019t want your apartment to start on fire, do you? If she wasn\u2019t coming to get it and you heard it, even if she was being irresponsible, your apartment not catching fire is definitely your business. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I have have a judgment based on that fact. Cause I am tempted to say YTA.", "YTA. You knew she was baking. You knew that the oven was going off. There was no reason for you not to take the cookies out of the oven.", "YTA. You shouldn't have roommates. You don't share space well and don't seem to have the interpersonal skills to be able to live peacefully with one.", "Technically, NTA. And I understand why you see this mentality as a sign of respect, but I do think this sort of thing is context-dependent. I do agree that not moving another person' things is good, but sometimes people do appreciate someone stepping in. For example, if I'm walking around with toilet paper stuck on my shoe, I appreciate it when people politely point this out to me. People are flawed and oftentimes make mistakes. Sometimes, what you might see as butting in makes another person's life a little easier.", "YTA - So the cookies weren\u2019t burned to a crisp but overdone. The difference between done and overdone with cookies is perhaps 3 minutes in the oven. So she spaced out for 2-3 minutes and you decided to punish her for that. You didn\u2019t even have to pull them out of the oven - you could have just yelled \u201cTimer!\u201d. She might have even shared some perfectly baked homemade cookies with you if you weren\u2019t such an insufferable roommate.", "NTA. nothing was burned. The cookies are her responsibility to look out for and she should have said something to you. But you sound like someone who should live alone or at least communicate your expectations with those who share living space with you.", "YTA. I'm antisocial, I don't like people getting into my business either and even I find you too much. A bit of kindness goes a long way. Makes me wonder how long are you actually \"stepping away\", maybe other people are tired of cleaning up after you, how about that perspective? It's a shared space.\n\nAnd I would be more than ready to go on a warpath with anyone who touches my oven.", "OP i don't think you're an AH but you, like me, should not have a roommate.  I think things that, as a one off may he mildly annoying are amplified x100 if you're always around someone.", "NTA but I'm not gonna lie all the info you shared makes you sound pretty insufferable. It's not that hard to just be helpful OP.", "Considering your replies to certain comments I'm gonna go NTA because it seems like you weren't doing it to be malicious or anything, you were following your own definition of respect. Perhaps a clear conversation with your roommate about things like this should be had to both reduce possible tension between the two of you and to prevent future scenarios like this from happening.", "The whole time I was reading this I thought, \"Be whoever you want, OP, but it would be hard to be around you.\" Every inch of this post feels... unlikable, I'm not sure why. Maybe because the concept that nothing matters outside of yourself is not an endearing personality trait.", "That was my thought too. Like, how long would she just let them stay in the oven? I hope the roommate has renter\u2019s insurance.", "This is a NAH comment, you may want to correct", "In my family as a kid, whoever was closest to the oven would take whatever was in there out when the timer went off. Then go tell whoever was cooking to check on it. No one turned the oven off in case it needed more time. That\u2019s how I do it now unless someone asks me not too. It literally takes bare minimum effort.", "Yeah that you see the world differently doesn\u2019t make it better. See some see now wrong in using force to get what they want and draw the line in the sand on a different place when it comes to what is okay to them. \n\nJust compare your average drug lord to a Amish person to your highschool teacher to your parents. Everyone has a different stance on violence, who is right? \n\nIMO I do think YTA because what respect is it , to see someone fail? You could have helped, but you have taught yourself that since you find it not necessary it is okay to do so.", "Would you have kept sitting there in the kitchen as the oven started smoking? As the cookies burned? As a fire started? At what point is some basic decency and common sense \"not your business\"? You didn't necessarily have to be responsible to take her cookies out of the oven, but you absolutely could have just yelled out when she didn't show up within a minute of the timer.", "I mostly get where you are coming from. But there is minding your own business and then being ignorant. If she had fallen asleep and the cookies burst into flame behind you, would you have done anything?\n\nYeah it\u2019s bad she ignored the timer or went to where she couldn\u2019t hear it- but would it kill you to call out \u201ctimer\u201d when you heard it and she didn\u2019t come back?", "That's a very weird, antisocial attitude. People are meant to be interconnected and to help each other.", "That's adorable.", "Our family always yelled, \"Timer, check the freezer.\"  Origin story...my mom once put some soda in the freezer for a quick cool down and set the timer but didn't tell anyone and left the house. We all heard the timer, but the oven wasn't on, so we had no idea what it was for. 6 hours later, when she got home, it was a heck of a mess.", "I'm glad my sister and I weren't the only ones that did that", "It\u2019s kind of funny that this massive paragraph you wrote is to promote the benefits of brevity.", "Agreed. Made me think of the videos where you see a bird adorably mimicking some sound.", "It really is adorable.", "Here is where I lean toward you being an AH. You criticize your roommate for assuming you would know she wants you to pull the cookies out, but you assume everyone else \"heard the beep,\" so to speak. It takes nothing to say, \"Hey, a timer went off.\" \n\nYou also keep talking about respect, but your words drip with condescension.", "Wait, you\u2019re saying you assumed your roommate was just letting a timer go off without responding on purpose?", "YTA don\u2019t be obtuse."]}
