For example, if I am in the kitchen doing something and step out for a few moments. I hate if I came back and someone has \"cleaned up\" after me. Unless obviously something was in the way or they needed to use something. But I hate when people don't just mind their business and leave stuff how it was. I hated when I lived at home and my mom would tidy up my room when I wasn't around. Nothing crazy but say I left a shirt hanging on my bed frame. I know exactly where that shirt is. Now I am coming back looking for it and it's in a new spot. I ask my mom, she doesn't remember where she put it etc etc. I just am a big believer in minding my own business. I strongly dislike if I am making something in the oven and have a timer set and it goes off and someone takes it out right away and turns the oven off. Usually I want to leave it in a bit longer or maybe that was just the first step and it needed to be checked on. Even if that was the time for it to be taken out. I would much rather people just mind their own things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I extend this courtesy to others and its very much in my nature to mind my own business. Usually what other people are doing isn't on my radar and people point out how I am usually in my \"own world\" a lot. My roommate(22f) on the other hand is the complete opposite. She has to be part of everything. If I'm watching something, she asks what I'm watching. If I look at my phone and laugh she asks why I'm laughing etc. It's not a problem. A lot of my friends are like this and I don't find it annoying, it can be endearing. She's like this with everyone. But she grew up in a big household whereas I was an only child so she has some different tendencies. She can be absent minded and easily distracted. She'll almost expect people around her to be watching out for her. She'll have water boiling on the stove and wander to another room. Also she has the annoying(to me) tendency to \"clean up\" after me or other people that are in the apartment\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was baking cookies in the oven and I was in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal. I was also wearing airpods. She left the kitchen for a while and eventually I heard the oven going off faintly through the airpods but it wasn't my business. Eventually she came rushing into the room and took the cookies out. They weren't burnt to the point where they smelled but her chewy cookies were solid. She told me I should have heard the oven and took them out.

It\u2019s not an insult\u2014but your post seems to indicate a few things that may be symptoms, such as having a specific way you like things to be, being inflexible in people disturbing your patterns, space, or routine, applying your own thoughts about the way things \u201cshould be\u201d to other people even though you say you recognize they are different (you cognitively seem to understand that she thinks differently but you can\u2019t seem to think or understand from her perspective), and not picking up on certain social cues.\n\nBecause I am reading deeply into what you are saying, I\u2019m going to say NTA because I feel like calling you an asshole is too far for just ignoring a timer that maybe you shouldn\u2019t have.

I've been in situations similar to what you mentioned. Left the water running or left something on. So if my roommate didn't turn it off I wouldn't feel any kind of way. It was my fault. Now if I left water running, remembered, called my roommate  who was home and asked her to turn it off. Then I would feel a way if she didn't turn it off.", "Explain why? Because it's not their business if no one asked.", "Cookies take like 10 mins, idk where this girl went with cookies in the oven", "When we were kids, if we heard a timer go off, one of us would run to the center of the house and yell \"beep\" very loudly. It was the quickest way to alert anyone home.", "See?  You said it all in one sentence. \"I see not messing with other people's things as respect.\"  That's what you need to tell her and all your flatmates, along with the tolerance you showed for her background helping to explain her behavior in your mind but not spoken. Maybe just saying something to them all at the same time like, \"we're all coming from different expectations of the best way to live with other people, I like you guys, and I'd like to just lay it out why I let the cookies cook past the timer.  If you want me to do something, ask me directly.\"  Sounds like she might also be a bit of a shite-stirrer so you want to say it to all of them.  And to be clear -- you have a right to that attitude of not messing with people's things as respect.  I have the exact same attitude and would have been really happy if you'd been my roommate or flatmate.  The question, to me, is do you want to be friends with your flatmates or just live with them while you have to and then move on?  If good relationships or even friendships are the goal/s, then being clear and kind is your best strategy.  Your generation is going through hell with tons of mixed signals and too much data pouring into their brains all the time.

I would hate to live with you", "Team NAH here. \n\nI\u2019m the same way when it comes to not wanting people to interfere with what I\u2019m doing. It messes with my brain and drives me up a wall. If I\u2019m doing a thing it\u2019s because I want it done my way. TBH if I don\u2019t care how a thing is done, I\u2019m likely to ask someone else to do it. \n\nI also think she\u2019s NTA either. She\u2019s just different from you. You and I would probably be compatible roommates.  I think you\u2019re doing pretty well to put up with her. She seems totally fine but would be difficult for me to live with. \n\nThat said, as my husband loses his hearing I\u2019m learning more and more to not mind my own business. If I hear a timer going off I tap him on the shoulder and call his attention to it. I come behind him and turn faucets off and only rarely do I annoy him because he left it running on purpose; usually it\u2019s because he can\u2019t hear it so he forgets about it. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible for you to learn to work with each other\u2019s differences. Maybe you can come to an agreement that she will alert you to a timer instead of taking your stuff out of the oven, and will let you know if she wants you to keep an ear out for her timer. Try y", "OP, is there any chance that you are neurodivergent?  Either way I think your perspective mostly makes sense when you explain it but doesn't when you don't.

If you don\u2019t want other people answering your alarms, you should not leave your food unattended.\nSame goes for her", "NTA. She put cookies in the oven which are at most 15 minutes, some as little as 5 depending on size. Why was she wondering so far from the oven when she out something in?? \n\nI would make sure to communicate with her, though that you will not remove something from the oven unless specifically asked to. Communication is usually a good thing.", "If someone is cooking it's 100% on the person cooking to not walk away from the stove/oven. They are solely responsible for managing timers and making sure things don't burn. She didn't even ask you to keep an eye on it.

She sounds irresponsible.   She needs people to stop enabling her", "NTA - I've had many roommates who do stuff like this. Not your problem.", "Nta, if you knew the cookies were gonna burn you would've taken them out. You partially gave the long preamble to point out that you simply were not paying attention to her baking and had no idea what she was doing. You heard the beep and dismissed it, assuming she'd be back in time anyway.  Then just forgot about it and put it out of your mind because it wasn't your business \n\nI wouldn't dare yell at a roommate for not taking my cookies out of the oven. That's 100% her own fuckup lol. But it seems like you guys are on pretty good terms and even though you're really different you can still handle or even appreciate her asking about your funny videos and trying to chat all the time. Being friends with roommates was one of the best experiences of my 20s, really even in my life.  I would apologize to her and explain that you are just different from her and don't pay attention to other people's stuff, and thought she had the cookies covered. Of course if you knew they were burning you would have taken them out. \n\nOn the point of the preamble, you might reconsider adjusting your attitude around people cleaning up after you too. If people are tidying rooms when you leave, it's because they don't want to sit or work in clutter.  In a shared space especially, one item begets more items. I'm sure that was your mother's impulse when she sees a shirt or shoes out.  Annoying as it was for her to go through your room as an adult, most of what she knows about you is having to attend to your every need and you being totally helpless as a child. It was easier for her to pick up one item at a time rather than wait for the entire room to explode with your shit, and therefore this is her habit.  For your roommate, she likely feels the same.  As soon as one person throws a coat down, 5 people do. Putting small items away or folding stuff up is a compromise.  They get a nice clean space, you don't get nagging or resentment directed your way, theoretically everyone can win", "YTA. It takes very little effort to call out to her that the timer went off. Doesn't even require you to leave your chair.", "YTA, because it\u2019s so unnecessary to antagonize the people you live with in situations where it would be so easy not to just by using a little common sense.", "YTA for the simple reason that you would rather make a point than be momentarily inconvenienced on principle. I very much dislike people like you and avoid them at all costs at work. \n\nWhen you have a roommate you do things for each other. You don\u2019t have to take the food out but if you hear a timer and she didn\u2019t you say something. This feels like it\u2019s punitive because she cleaned up in the kitchen and you didn\u2019t want her to. Most people clean as they go. You should try it. Quit keeping score or you\u2019re gonna have a bad time.", "You don\u2019t want your apartment to start on fire, do you? If she wasn\u2019t coming to get it and you heard it, even if she was being irresponsible, your apartment not catching fire is definitely your business. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I have have a judgment based on that fact. Cause I am tempted to say YTA.", "YTA. You knew she was baking. You knew that the oven was going off. There was no reason for you not to take the cookies out of the oven.", "YTA. You shouldn't have roommates. You don't share space well and don't seem to have the interpersonal skills to be able to live peacefully with one.", "Technically, NTA. And I understand why you see this mentality as a sign of respect, but I do think this sort of thing is context-dependent. I do agree that not moving another person' things is good, but sometimes people do appreciate someone stepping in. For example, if I'm walking around with toilet paper stuck on my shoe, I appreciate it when people politely point this out to me. People are flawed and oftentimes make mistakes. Sometimes, what you might see as butting in makes another person's life a little easier.", "YTA - So the cookies weren\u2019t burned to a crisp but overdone. The difference between done and overdone with cookies is perhaps 3 minutes in the oven. So she spaced out for 2-3 minutes and you decided to punish her for that. You didn\u2019t even have to pull them out of the oven - you could have just yelled \u201cTimer!\u201d. She might have even shared some perfectly baked homemade cookies with you if you weren\u2019t such an insufferable roommate.", "NTA. nothing was burned. The cookies are her responsibility to look out for and she should have said something to you. But you sound like someone who should live alone or at least communicate your expectations with those who share living space with you.", "YTA. I'm antisocial, I don't like people getting into my business either and even I find you too much. A bit of kindness goes a long way. Makes me wonder how long are you actually \"stepping away\", maybe other people are tired of cleaning up after you, how about that perspective?

NAH", "Did you read the comment where he said if roommate left the faucet on, he would also just let it ran even though there's flooding because it's none of his business? OP is a big AH", "there\u2019s no such thing as mild autism, it\u2019s not. linear spectrum, also no need to blame her sex on how she acts. your opinion seems extremely uneducated and sexist", "Three adults in their forties in this house.  \n\nIf something makes a alert noise (microwave, oven, dishwasher, dryer, etc.), someone will invariably yell **\"WHY HIM BEEP?!?!\"**", "This perfectly expresses my take on the situation.", "I wonder if he\u2019s on the spectrum. Most people won\u2019t think someone is on the spectrum if it\u2019s mild but find the person very unlikable as you mention. OP is very rigid in his ideas.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Do you see not saying \u201chey your timer went off, do you want any help?\u201d as respect\u2014like that\u2019s somehow offensive? I feel like you\u2019re under no *obligation* to do so, and your free to say it bothers *you* if people try to be helpful (though really sounds like childhood trauma you should unpack there if you ever want a happy life and decent relationship\u2014based on the rant about your mom) but you know your roommate wouldn\u2019t feel disrespected because you alerted them or even helped without asking. So it\u2019s not really about respect. Because respect is about other people, and you\u2019re aware of this person\u2019s preferences. That didn\u2019t make you obligated to help, but it did mean that not helping does not magically equal respect. If you didn\u2019t think to help, that\u2019s fine, just like it would have been if you didn\u2019t hear it, but going on about your weird hang up isn\u2019t doing you any favors here. People like to be treated differently and you seem to understand that\u2014I think she\u2019s TA when she doesn\u2019t treat you how you like to be treated if you tell her/she knows, but if you know they want help with something (even without them asking) and you don\u2019t help, that\u2019s not about respect any more. It\u2019s a fixation.\n\nI do think it\u2019s reasonable to not know if they wanted something done at the timer, and it\u2019s not cool she called you rude. But the more I see your inner thinking about this, the less I agree with your premise. Respect isn\u2019t about acting how you wish others would act\u2014it\u2019s about acting how you know they want you to (unless that crosses a boundary for you, of course\u2014you\u2019re not obligated to help, but it\u2019s not respectful to not help particularly if you know they like to be helped in such situations even if you don\u2019t).", "You\u2019re actually disrespecting everyone. YTA \nIf the kitchen caught on fire would you ignore it because it\u2019s non of your business? You realise you have an anti social personality disorder right? While this doesn\u2019t bother you, your behaviour is hurtful, disrespectful and potentially harmful to others.", "Lol if something was on fire, instead of putting it off, you just leave because it's none of your business?

They\u2019ll think you\u2019re a spiteful asshole who must hate them.", "I know this might sound sarcastic, but I'm speaking in earnest: caring for other people and allowing yourself to be cared for by others is ok.

You can mind your own business while doing a common courtesy and letting your roomate know. It\u2019s less of a hassle than the smoke alarm going off or something", "Idk, have you read his other comments? He thinks it would've been OK if he let the cookies go 20 more minutes. He thinks it's ok to not turn off a running faucet when your roommate leaves the apartment. I respect someone who keeps to themselves. I keep to myself.

Nothing wrong with me saying that sucks.", "It\u2019s not but it isn\u2019t a bad question since OP included the weird as fuck rant AND doubled down on a question of how he\u2019d feel if someone didn\u2019t turn off water he left on in his room by accident (hypothetically). I\u2019m not concerned about the cookies but I am not sure if OP would find it disrespectful to stop an actual problem at any place or where their line is, because they\u2019re being pretty extreme here (less in the situation than their philosophy and comments).", "yeah this is so disingenuous i don't even see why it's desirable to post this. a fire in op's home would obviously be op's business. op needs therapy but this this is a weird analogy", "As someone who sets oven times short of when they are actually done, this \u2018take someone else\u2019s stuff out and turn off the oven\u2019 thing would drive me nuts, and can easily ruin food, depending on what\u2019s cooking. ESPECIALLY baked goods. She put them in, it was plenty reasonable for him to expect she would come deal with it and not to mess with it, or even call out. Cookies bake for pretty short times, not enough to forget about it. I\u2019ve had this issue when family members hear the beep and take it out and now I have a mess to deal with instead of baked deliciousness. He just expecting op and o deal with it is the bizarre part - she didn\u2019t ask and he had no reason to assume she needed or wanted help. Definitely feels like she might have been the baby of the family, and op would very much do better living alone or not explicitly stating perspectives about this kind of issue (sounds like toes have been stepped on before snd op is not a fan), but he didn\u2019t sit there 30min past the timer and hope hokey pucks formed in the oven. They hadn\u2019t started to burn or smell, they were just a little more done than she wanted - that\u2019s on her for not being on top of her baking or asking for what she seems to have just expected him to telepathically know she wanted. He seems the kind of guy people who expect more active engagement from roommates might clash with, but that\u2019s the kinda vibe I want - I do mine, you do yours, as long as we are not actively inconveniencing each other and if one asks for something it\u2019s done, to each their own. I tend to clean and organize by taking things out and laying them out- if someone came behind me and just put it all away without asking if I wanted help I\u2019d be steamed. Don\u2019t touch, that\u2019s it\u2019s SPOT for now. Don\u2019t take my cookie out, I know when I need to come back. I can hear the timer beep from the other side of the house and the basement, what was she so busy with that she couldn\u2019t yell out \u2018can you grab those\u2019 and make sure he heard if she wasn\u2019t coming for them?", "And OP\u2019s roommate could\u2019ve acted like an adult and stayed near the timer to hear it and take out her cookies. Whatever she had (wanted) to do could\u2019ve waited until after her cookies were done, but she just expects other people to look out for her and take attention away from what they were doing.

They aren\u2019t purposefully sabotaging anything, just remaining passive. And recognizing a dick move isn\u2019t the same as calling yourself a full-time asshole.", "Except his roommate obviously wasn\u2019t hearing the alarm.", "An ice water bath will cool a wine bottle faster", "Because we live in a society and doing minor things to help people is part of living in society. Nobody is asking OP to like risk his life or anything. You hear a beep, you tell someone. OP said in a comment he thinks it's reasonable to let a house flood if the alternative is turning off the water someone else turned on. That's insane", "Okay now *that* sounds like projection, who hurt you?", "Tried to tell him that, but he wasn't the smartest and stubborn.", "Chill, bud. He's just wired differently."]}
