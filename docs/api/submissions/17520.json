For example, if I am in the kitchen doing something and step out for a few moments. I hate if I came back and someone has \"cleaned up\" after me. Unless obviously something was in the way or they needed to use something. But I hate when people don't just mind their business and leave stuff how it was. I hated when I lived at home and my mom would tidy up my room when I wasn't around. Nothing crazy but say I left a shirt hanging on my bed frame. I know exactly where that shirt is. Now I am coming back looking for it and it's in a new spot. I ask my mom, she doesn't remember where she put it etc etc. I just am a big believer in minding my own business. I strongly dislike if I am making something in the oven and have a timer set and it goes off and someone takes it out right away and turns the oven off. Usually I want to leave it in a bit longer or maybe that was just the first step and it needed to be checked on. Even if that was the time for it to be taken out. I would much rather people just mind their own things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I extend this courtesy to others and its very much in my nature to mind my own business. Usually what other people are doing isn't on my radar and people point out how I am usually in my \"own world\" a lot. My roommate(22f) on the other hand is the complete opposite. She has to be part of everything. If I'm watching something, she asks what I'm watching. If I look at my phone and laugh she asks why I'm laughing etc. It's not a problem. A lot of my friends are like this and I don't find it annoying, it can be endearing. She's like this with everyone. But she grew up in a big household whereas I was an only child so she has some different tendencies. She can be absent minded and easily distracted. She'll almost expect people around her to be watching out for her. She'll have water boiling on the stove and wander to another room. Also she has the annoying(to me) tendency to \"clean up\" after me or other people that are in the apartment\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was baking cookies in the oven and I was in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal. I was also wearing airpods. She left the kitchen for a while and eventually I heard the oven going off faintly through the airpods but it wasn't my business. Eventually she came rushing into the room and took the cookies out. They weren't burnt to the point where they smelled but her chewy cookies were solid. She told me I should have heard the oven and took them out. I told her if that's what she wanted she should have told me to listen for the oven and I would take them out and that you can't just assume someone will.

It\u2019s not an insult\u2014but your post seems to indicate a few things that may be symptoms, such as having a specific way you like things to be, being inflexible in people disturbing your patterns, space, or routine, applying your own thoughts about the way things \u201cshould be\u201d to other people even though you say you recognize they are different (you cognitively seem to understand that she thinks differently but you can\u2019t seem to think or understand from her perspective), and not picking up on certain social cues.\n\nBecause I am reading deeply into what you are saying, I\u2019m going to say NTA because I feel like calling you an asshole is too far for just ignoring a timer that maybe you shouldn\u2019t have.

I've been in situations similar to what you mentioned. Left the water running or left something on. So if my roommate didn't turn it off I wouldn't feel any kind of way. It was my fault. Now if I left water running, remembered, called my roommate  who was home and asked her to turn it off. Then I would feel a way if she didn't turn it off.", "Explain why? Because it's not their business if no one asked.", "Cookies take like 10 mins, idk where this girl went with cookies in the oven", "When we were kids, if we heard a timer go off, one of us would run to the center of the house and yell \"beep\" very loudly. It was the quickest way to alert anyone home.", "See?  You said it all in one sentence. \"I see not messing with other people's things as respect.\"  That's what you need to tell her and all your flatmates, along with the tolerance you showed for her background helping to explain her behavior in your mind but not spoken. Maybe just saying something to them all at the same time like, \"we're all coming from different expectations of the best way to live with other people, I like you guys, and I'd like to just lay it out why I let the cookies cook past the timer.  If you want me to do something, ask me directly.\"  Sounds like she might also be a bit of a shite-stirrer so you want to say it to all of them.  And to be clear -- you have a right to that attitude of not messing with people's things as respect.  I have the exact same attitude and would have been really happy if you'd been my roommate or flatmate.  The question, to me, is do you want to be friends with your flatmates or just live with them while you have to and then move on?  If good relationships or even friendships are the goal/s, then being clear and kind is your best strategy.  Your generation is going through hell with tons of mixed signals and too much data pouring into their brains all the time.

I would hate to live with you", "Team NAH here. \n\nI\u2019m the same way when it comes to not wanting people to interfere with what I\u2019m doing. It messes with my brain and drives me up a wall. If I\u2019m doing a thing it\u2019s because I want it done my way. TBH if I don\u2019t care how a thing is done, I\u2019m likely to ask someone else to do it. \n\nI also think she\u2019s NTA either. She\u2019s just different from you. You and I would probably be compatible roommates.  I think you\u2019re doing pretty well to put up with her. She seems totally fine but would be difficult for me to live with. \n\nThat said, as my husband loses his hearing I\u2019m learning more and more to not mind my own business. If I hear a timer going off I tap him on the shoulder and call his attention to it. I come behind him and turn faucets off and only rarely do I annoy him because he left it running on purpose; usually it\u2019s because he can\u2019t hear it so he forgets about it. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible for you to learn to work with each other\u2019s differences. Maybe you can come to an agreement that she will alert you to a timer instead of taking your stuff out of the oven, and will let you know if she wants you to keep an ear out for her timer. Try y", "OP, is there any chance that you are neurodivergent?  Either way I think your perspective mostly makes sense when you explain it but doesn't when you don't.

If you don\u2019t want other people answering your alarms, you should not leave your food unattended.\nSame goes for her", "NTA. She put cookies in the oven which are at most 15 minutes, some as little as 5 depending on size. Why was she wondering so far from the oven when she out something in?? \n\nI would make sure to communicate with her, though that you will not remove something from the oven unless specifically asked to. Communication is usually a good thing.", "If someone is cooking it's 100% on the person cooking to not walk away from the stove/oven. They are solely responsible for managing timers and making sure things don't burn. She didn't even ask you to keep an eye on it.

She sounds irresponsible.   She needs people to stop enabling her", "NTA - I've had many roommates who do stuff like this. Not your problem.", "Nta, if you knew the cookies were gonna burn you would've taken them out. You partially gave the long preamble to point out that you simply were not paying attention to her baking and had no idea what she was doing. You heard the beep and dismissed it, assuming she'd be back in time anyway.  Then just forgot about it and put it out of your mind because it wasn't your business \n\nI wouldn't dare yell at a roommate for not taking my cookies out of the oven. That's 100% her own fuckup lol. But it seems like you guys are on pretty good terms and even though you're really different you can still handle or even appreciate her asking about your funny videos and trying to chat all the time. Being friends with roommates was one of the best experiences of my 20s, really even in my life.  I would apologize to her and explain that you are just different from her and don't pay attention to other people's stuff, and thought she had the cookies covered. Of course if you knew they were burning you would have taken them out. \n\nOn the point of the preamble, you might reconsider adjusting your attitude around people cleaning up after you too. If people are tidying rooms when you leave, it's because they don't want to sit or work in clutter.  In a shared space especially, one item begets more items. I'm sure that was your mother's impulse when she sees a shirt or shoes out.  Annoying as it was for her to go through your room as an adult, most of what she knows about you is having to attend to your every need and you being totally helpless as a child. It was easier for her to pick up one item at a time rather than wait for the entire room to explode with your shit, and therefore this is her habit.  For your roommate, she likely feels the same.  As soon as one person throws a coat down, 5 people do. Putting small items away or folding stuff up is a compromise.  They get a nice clean space, you don't get nagging or resentment directed your way, theoretically everyone can win", "YTA. It takes very little effort to call out to her that the timer went off. Doesn't even require you to leave your chair.", "YTA, because it\u2019s so unnecessary to antagonize the people you live with in situations where it would be so easy not to just by using a little common sense.", "YTA for the simple reason that you would rather make a point than be momentarily inconvenienced on principle. I very much dislike people like you and avoid them at all costs at work. \n\nWhen you have a roommate you do things for each other. You don\u2019t have to take the food out but if you hear a timer and she didn\u2019t you say something. This feels like it\u2019s punitive because she cleaned up in the kitchen and you didn\u2019t want her to. Most people clean as they go. You should try it. Quit keeping score or you\u2019re gonna have a bad time.", "You don\u2019t want your apartment to start on fire, do you? If she wasn\u2019t coming to get it and you heard it, even if she was being irresponsible, your apartment not catching fire is definitely your business. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I have have a judgment based on that fact. Cause I am tempted to say YTA.", "YTA. You knew she was baking. You knew that the oven was going off. There was no reason for you not to take the cookies out of the oven.", "YTA. You shouldn't have roommates. You don't share space well and don't seem to have the interpersonal skills to be able to live peacefully with one.", "Technically, NTA. And I understand why you see this mentality as a sign of respect, but I do think this sort of thing is context-dependent. I do agree that not moving another person' things is good, but sometimes people do appreciate someone stepping in. For example, if I'm walking around with toilet paper stuck on my shoe, I appreciate it when people politely point this out to me. People are flawed and oftentimes make mistakes. Sometimes, what you might see as butting in makes another person's life a little easier.", "YTA - So the cookies weren\u2019t burned to a crisp but overdone. The difference between done and overdone with cookies is perhaps 3 minutes in the oven. So she spaced out for 2-3 minutes and you decided to punish her for that. You didn\u2019t even have to pull them out of the oven - you could have just yelled \u201cTimer!\u201d. She might have even shared some perfectly baked homemade cookies with you if you weren\u2019t such an insufferable roommate.", "NTA. nothing was burned. The cookies are her responsibility to look out for and she should have said something to you. But you sound like someone who should live alone or at least communicate your expectations with those who share living space with you.", "YTA. I'm antisocial, I don't like people getting into my business either and even I find you too much. A bit of kindness goes a long way. Makes me wonder how long are you actually \"stepping away\", maybe other people are tired of cleaning up after you, how about that perspective?

Please, listen for it in case I don't hear it.\"", "No offense to the only children out there, but when you said you were an only child I instantly knew the type. World revolves around you, type.

When it comes to ovens, cooking , washing machines etc. it's easy to cause a serious incident. That would affect everyone living there, so you should keep an eye on those situations.\n\nYou have to think of your roommates and can't just keep your things wherever you want. If they need to use something then they have to move your things.\n\nMy roommate was absentminded and she put my electric kettle on a stove and forgot it's on, twice. If I didn't notice our dorm room would burn down. If the forgotten cookies caused an accident you all would be affected.", "YTA. If the alarm goes off and it's clear the person hasn't heard it, shouting \"Timers gone off\" or similar is the normal thing to do. You knew full well that they didn't hear it and what was in the oven would be spoiled and chose to keep silent. \n\nFor what it's worth, your outlook an everything in life as described in your OP is broken to the point that this will severely impact all your friendships and relationships. How you perceive space and interactions is not healthy or neurotypical.

People who ignore everyone else's business completely can be just as bad as those who are in everyone's business all the time, imo. But I'm gonna say NTA in this scenario! You were right that she should have said something if she wasn't sure she'd be able to take them out right when the timer went off. You couldn't have known that she wouldn't be there to pull them out when the timer was up.", "YTA. I have many friends who are only children, or had absent parents, and that's no excuse to not be a decent person. If you didn't hear the alarm that's a different story, but you did, and couldn't have even shouted her name or something?", "I\u2019m just going with NAH for this one since it is so mild, but you are pretty rude, honestly.", "NTA in this situation, but only on the technicalities. \n\nHOWEVER, I do have to ask: have you even been tested for autism?

How you are independent and are often in your own world. \n\nA lot of these points for me were diagnosed as symptoms of ASD. also just the general feel of how you talk and see the world. Might be worth checking out.", "NTA for this instance in particular, but overall you sound exhausting. There is a difference between minding your business and being a tool.", "YTA. \n\nYou seem to severely misunderstand what \"mind your own business\" means. Someone gets into an argument with a significant other or is having family problems and they don't want to talk about it? Yeah, mind your own business, it's not about you. \n\nSomeone is doing an everyday task and it would be polite to call out and give them a heads up or a reminder? That's not being intrusive, that's being a decent human. You seem kind of self-absorbed OP. Not everything is about you, and I think you'll enjoy your life more if you learn to interact with other people.", "YTA. Your attitude is not conductive to good interpersonal relationships", "YTA. It would take such little effort to shout out for example \"The oven is beeping, want me to turn it off?\"\n\nI\u2019m kinda like you to where I like to remain in my own world and don\u2019t like people cleaning up for me or whatever, even to my own detriment at times, and I would that 100% of the time.", "YTA. A lot of what you wrote actually resonated with me. I too am someone who minds my own business and don\u2019t like other people to encroach on my personal space. But my roommate is almost like yours. She loves being social with me. And as a general courtesy I try to be helpful and be aware of her needs as well. You should probably try to do the same because tbh you sound insufferable.", "NTA or NAH\n\nI think there\u2019s miscommunication and different expectations in what you and your roommate expect from each other, but I dont think either of you is especially in the wrong. I think she should/could have told you if she wanted you to keep an ear out for her cookies or you could have told her you heard the alarm\n\nI get your annoyance at people touching your stuff too I hate it.

Hating being interrupted, things lying around but she knows exactly where they are, difficulty finding things that have been moved, \"in her own world\" are all pretty classic ADHD or Autism symptoms. As a girl and an only child, it's entirely possible that she missed a diagnosis as a kid as her symptoms may not have risen to the point of dysfunction. It may not even be dysfunction now, but it does seem like a clear pattern of behavior.\n\nI say ESH. Don't ignore oven timers because of fire safety, but the roommate should have been clear in her expectations if she was counting on OP to assist.", "Im autistic too and had the same suspicion especially upon seeing everyone respond to them with YTA when I didnt see that big an issue \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude2c\n\nThe look out for others things when its not life or death is an unwritten rule I didn\u2019t get was so big a deal until now either, but I could also see this being an issue with them being extra respectful in a way they\u2019d like(their stuff left completely alone) coming from disrespectful housemates", "Yeah, from some of OP's other comments, they are either neuro divergent or just really messed up.\n\nShort term solution is OP and their roommate both need to communicate better. Long term, it sounds like OP needs to see a psychologist or someone to work out what's going on and how they can learn to understand themselves and others.", "I would argue that they are great at sharing spaces because they just leave their roommates' stuff alone.\n\nThe worst things I could imagine roommates do is fuck with my stuff or steal my food, which I have read a lot of stories about. So a roommate who just minds their own business? Heaven.", "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one with this line of thought, the responses are also reflective of what undiagnosed ND people hear from NT people who haven\u2019t considered that possibility - I really think looking into it would at least be of benefit", "I absolutely get it. Don't know if it's because I'm an only child too, but I hate when people interfere with what I'm doing, even if they are just trying to be nice.\n\nAnd it's especially bad with anything in the kitchen.", "you need therapy because you have a very skewed concept of respect. Many of your words and actions are generally disrespectful, but because you were raised to look out for yourself an nobody else, you think it\u2019s normal.", "You were parentified and now you are going around passive aggressively parentifying the whole world. You\u2019re treating people like they should never be interconnected. Get some therapy!!!!!", "It\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve managed to conflate passive aggression with respect, lmao. YTA", "Sounds like it\u2019s your world and everyone else just lives in it", "But don't you outright acknowledge she's different though? Like this event wasn't a revelation was it?", "But clearly, from your post, you're aware of the fact that not *everyone* sees it as respectful, including your roommate. You are aware of that. So how about you stop using that as an excuse - because clearly, it has nothing to do with respect.\n\nI honestly wouldn't want to live with a roommate who acted like you. Either live on your own, so you can be as antisocial as you want - or suck it up and realise that living with other people *does* mean you have to adjust your behaviour, and that you can't always have everything exactly how you want it.", "Hearing the oven ding and yelling for your room mate in another part of the house who couldn't't hear it (a task that takes absolutely zero effort) is _very_ different from \"being expected to watch the baking\"", "Honestly if OP gave me a heads up about this I'd be fine living with them.", "You can know who you are and still be an AH. Or at the very least unpleasant to be around.", "Knowing you are an AH in general and not changing makes you a larger AH. It shouldn't end with \"that's just who I am\".", "Strongly seconding this. OP got pretty messed up by their parents - like it happened to a lot of people - but changing this one attitude might help them just be happier.", "Didn't know I was such a rare breed of person, but I absolutely agree with OP.\n\nIf I make something in the kitchen and someone sitting in there calls out for me to let me know the alarm is going off (which is probably way louder and more noticeable that their voice), I just assume they want to passively let me know the alarm is annoying to them. Because of course I can hear the damn thing, and what exactly do they assume I plan to do, aside from going to the kitchen, turning it  off and finishing the dish?!\n\nI think it's really annoying for people to state the obvious and even worse to meddle with the things I am making.\n\n(I guess as a fellow only child who spent most of their week home alone, you get used to doing things on your own and in your own way. You just don't rely on other people doing something or notifying you, so when they do, it feels like intruding.)", "Yeah I normally set the timer because it's easier to remember when to turn/check whatever I have cooking there.\n\nDepending on how long OP and her roommate have been living together because this sounds like an ESH situation and they both need to communicate more and respect eachother more.", "I had a female friend who grew up with four brothers who used to steal food of her plate. Any hand came towards her plate she would automatically go to cover it.\n\nTook her years of freaking out waiters to untrain that habit.", "Great, maybe you should live with OP then. And leave other people alone. Because I guarantee, most people don't want to live like this, constantly having to walk on eggshells around someone who always assumes the worst of them.", "But you also say that your roommate has the tendency to wander off if a pot is boiling. So, you already know he or she isn\u2019t someone who has everything under control, and it sounds like you have judgement around this.\n\n So, when you say you assume other adults have things under control, you already know this assumption is incorrect in this case. \n\nI think you think that\u2019s how everyone else SHOULD be, so you like to punish your roommate a bit for this by not bothering to yell out, \u2018Buzzer is going off!\u2019 \n\nYou\u2019ve got some very rigid life-rules going on that may need to be softened a bit if you want to have a lot of human company in your life.", "So if you see someone choking you move on because its not your business?", "You don't have things under control.

Then put all the utensils you\u2019re using in there as you go. No mess on the counter sides from dirty utensils, nothing dries/cakes on to the utensils so they are easy to wash at the end, and they are all in one place so you aren\u2019t hunting around for the whisk you swear was in your hand moments earlier.

Abusers claim to love their victims, after all.", "Go stick a soda can in your freezer for 6 hours and then come back and tell us what happened", "I honestly think OP might be on the autism spectrum. The whole story, the stress when someone does something against their assumptions and how they are mostly focused on their own stuff. \n\nMight be worth checking out, for them and their (future) roommate.", "Chill, dude. OP isn't an abuser just cause they didn't tell their roommate the timer went off."]}
