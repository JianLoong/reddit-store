I just want to add here, that I really love babies, so when I meet them, the girl was 2 mo. and I absolutely adore her, and I still do.\n\nMy husband, friend and wife share the same musical taste. Last year she (wife/friend) got tickets to a concert. I offered to take care of the kids so she, hers and my husband could enjoy the concert together. I went to their place after work ( 5 p.m.) and it was fine, putting aside the fact that I was exhausted, and the kids went to bed almost at midnight. \n\nFast forward to today, I have been asked a few times if I can take care of the kids so they all 3 can go to concerts. I have said no to all of them. I do not know why but this upsets me a lot, not in a way that I get angry, but it does affect my mood. I am a very straightforward person and luckily, I know how to say no. At the end of last year, the husband asked me, and I said no because of work and I\u2019ll be tired, he started asking me what time I was working, (I answered him) which he said it was not too early and that I would still rest. I shut him down as I don\u2019t have to explain myself. Unfortunately, because of this, my friend (his wife) did not go to that concert.\n\nThis year my friend asked me again if I could take care of the kids. She said something along the lines: \u201c2 things: would you like to go to a concert, or would you be able to stay with the kids\u201d (this rubs me the wrong way for some reason). I said I have plans already and to ask my husband if he wanted to do it. Her husband was working that day btw and my husband ended up looking after the kids.\n\nSo, today I have been asked again. There is a concert that my husband and the two of them are going. She knows I am working a long shift (7 am till 8:30 pm). She asked if I would consider going to their house after work and being there till midnight when they come back. That they are DEFINITELY paying (it has never been about the money), she added that she knows I am honest and that I should not feel obligated to do it.\nI have been vocal with my husband about how it bothers me to be asked to look after the kids every time they want to go to a concert, my husband does not get why I get upset and that I should simply say no and that is it. But I do feel that it\u2019s taking a toll on the friendship. I know they asked me because they trust me, and their kids like me. My friend (f37) is wonderful, she is nice and has been there for me always, she is overall a very sweet and caring person, but I do not like the situation that I have been put on. One thing is to offer and other things if to be asked every time they want to go out to this concert.\n\nSo, REDDIT, AITH?", "created_utc": 1684928711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qj6nx/aita_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_friends/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From her side because as I friend I refused to babysit and from my side because I keep being put in this awkward situation. I came here to see if I was the AH and because I want to tell her in a really nice but firm way to stop asking and that if I ever feel like it, I would offer myself to babysit like I have done it in the past (apart from emergencies that I would be there without the need of being asked).", "To be completely honest I would not go because I do not even know these bands so it does not bother at all that they all go to the concerts. It\u2019s more about the expectation of me to watch over the kids just because I don not like these bands and I won\u2019t go.

That\u2019s why I came here and see if I was being the AH.", "To be honest I would not use the word hate. I love my friend, I just don\u2019t like to be seen as the default babysitter.

It is just assumed that because I don\u2019t like this type of music I would not go and they are 100% right. Nevertheless I feel like I have been seen as the default babysitter because of this reason. I think it bothers me because of the fact that I\u2019m doing a 13.5 hours shift that day and they know it, I work in a psychiatrist hospital and my job is not easy. And even thought I don\u2019t have an issue saying no I think if this keeps happening it would affect the friendship and this is something I don\u2019t want it to happen.", "Honestly? NAH. Based on the title I went in assuming N T A and that the friend was asking every weekend or something. But 3-4 times in the past year or two is not an exuberant amount, especially when you do like their children and have done it before. I also saw this more as you allowing your SO a night out with friends that enjoy similar music that isn\u2019t really your cup of tea (since you mention all three of them like it but don\u2019t mention your taste I assume it\u2019s not really your thing). It sounds like the friends think this too based on how they have asked. It\u2019s more \u201chey this band is in X genre of music which your husband is a fan of but you aren\u2019t, he mentioned wanting to see them. would you rather come along and listen to music you don\u2019t enjoy or stay with our kids that you do like to be around while your SO goes to a show he enjoys.\u201d And less \u201chey we\u2019re ditching you with our kids all the time to go have fun without you.\u201d It also sounds like you enjoy time with this couple and the 4 of you are a support system for each other. If you want to tell them it\u2019s off the table and you won\u2019t do it anymore, be direct and tell them. But I think a better route would be to find a way to lean on them for something in return. Can they house sit when you and hubby go on a vacation? Do you have pets they could help out with? Maybe a home project they could bring the kids over and make a day of? \n\nI understand you feel uncomfortable with them asking, but they clearly aren\u2019t doing it with any ill-intent, so try not to see it that way.", "NAH. Honestly the number of people saying not the asshole and commenting on how your friend is using you is really surprising to me.\n\nI think this is just a matter of miscommunication where your friend simply doesn't realize that asking this of you is upsetting. From the sounds of it, when you say no that answer is respected \u2013 you aren't being guilted into changing your answer. She asks, you say no, someone else watches the kids instead.\n\nTo me it's reasonable that your friend would ask you, a trusted friend in a country where she has no family, to watch her children. Especially when you have offered to do so in the past, it isn't an especially frequent occurrence, and haven't told her to not ask you again (you have only told her no when she has asked again, and she has respected that answer). She's not doing anything wrong by simply asking, and the comment about paying makes me wonder if she thinks that's the reason you have said no.\n\nI will admit that I don't personally understand why this is a problem for you, but if being asked to watch the kids rubs you the wrong way and I think it's reasonable to let your friend know that you no longer want to be asked to watch the kids. It sounds like she is the kind of person who would respect that if she knows that it bothers you.", "NTA, remember the old saying Just Say No.", "You will know for sure if she's truly a good friend once you make it clear that you're done babysitting. You know they are taking advantage of you. I wish your husband would have said something to her husband when he  didn't take no for an answer. Is he okay with it because it benefits him?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to babysit - they can hire someone else.", "I don\u2019t know either and yes, those ages require loads of attention and energy which I won\u2019t have after a 13.5 hrs shift in a mental health hospital. But event if I was not working I would rather have an invitation to the concert (which I would politely decline as I don\u2019t like the band) than an request to babysit.", "Yes, this is exactly what I will be doing. Thank you!!", "Thank you for this!! I honestly don\u2019t think my friend is an AH at all. But I want to understand her rationale and tbh I was just assuming that maybe I was the AH? I will have an honest conversation with her because I don\u2019t want to loose our friendship over this or to make things awkward. \n\nJust to add some things, the first time I offered to babysit was on July last year. So I have been asked 3-4 times in the last 10 months. \nMy husband and his friend would go to these concerts and now that the kids are a bit older she wants to join (and I\u2019m happy for her). \nAnd as you mentioned, yes I like to be around her kids but I don\u2019t like to look after ANY kid especially after 13 hour shift haha!", "Thank you! And I get that she rather has someone she trust to look after her kids but would that always be the case then? That I would be expect to do it always because she trust me and she has no one else? as you said I think I need to communicate with her what I feels and hopefully we won\u2019t be in this situation again. \n\nRegarding the money. I would never charged her to look after the kids. If I ever do it again will be because I want to and I\u2019m doing a favour to her as a friend. I guess the money part comes from the fact that she might think I would believe she wants me to look after them because she wants to save some money (as I won\u2019t charge her)??? But I do not think so either. I know she is asking me because she would rather leave her kids with me than with someone else. Unfortunately I do have a very demanding job, I\u2019m doing a second degree right now, I\u2019m on the middle of exams! So I have a lot in my plate. \n\nAnd yes, she always accepts my answer and does not push at all (not like her husband haha) that\u2019s why I was feeling a bit like the AH. But I can understand why it\u2019s my fault as I haven\u2019t been clear. Thank you for your input.", "I was avoiding an awkward conversation with her and to tell her to please stop asking me and if I ever would do it again, I would let her know. \nIn the other hand, my husband does not mind as he still would go to the concerts without them or her. In the worst case scenario both husband will go and she will stay behind to look after the kids. So this is why I was feeling a bit like the AH.", "Yes! To be honest I was avoiding it and I was hoping I was not going to be asked again. But apparently I need to be clearer.", "That's fine if none of you have family in the country.\n\nBut it seems you all have jobs. Where income could be used to hire a babysitter. If they have money to buy concert tickets, they have money to pay a babysitter that isn't you.", "I mean it\u2019s nice that she trusts you but even and immigrants can usually have a hard time trusting people outside of their in-group with their kids. \n\nBUT you have to let her know to stop asking. My parents (the immigrants) never let anyone babysit us after they were done work even close family friend which imo was insane. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole but I think she might be feeling a little desperate and untrusting of her other options for babysitting. You should tell her asap that you\u2019re way too tired from work.", "The address the question in your first paragraph, I think it's not that you would always be expected to do it, but that she will probably often think of you as a good first option when looking for somebody to watch the kids. I think you're seeing that as an expectation to do it when she doesn't see it as an expectation but just as the option that makes the most sense to use if available, so she checks first and if you say no then she can move on to the next best option. Especially since your husband would be going to the event as well, and you wouldn't have an interest in going. But like I said (and you agreed) I think just letting her know you don't want to be asked should resolve it, and that way you're free to offer in the future if you want to do it, without feeling like there's an expectation for you to do that.\n\nSounds like everyone in this situation is kind and has good intentions, so I think once you have a little talk it will work out okay. Best of luck!", "If she can't get a babysitter, she and her husband should alternate who gets to go; she shouldn't always have to be the one to miss the concert.\n\nBut they (as a couple) do need to find some child care options.

Why tf are you not ever invited to go to the concerts?! Why are you always asked to babysit instead?! Even if you don't care for who is playing, go. I went to a concert with an artist I didn't like, but I got to listen to live music and most of all, spent time with friends. You are nta. But your friends and husband are", "Are they really assuming though? They're asking and they're immediately taking no for an answer. Also, OP isn't downright saying she doesn't (ever) want to, she's giving practical reasons (work, being tired, etc). So my guess is they think she likes watching the kids, ergo, they keep asking on the off chance she's available.\n\nI'm going NAH.", "As a parent, it might just be because you are a \"perfect match\", trusty, lovely with the kids, almost family.

They are treating you with disrespect.", "It's totally understandable that you do not want them having fun at a concert to equate to you having to babysit.\n\nAlso having to say no can feel like a confrontation or a situation where you have to assert boundaries which is not \"no big deal\" for everybody like your husband think.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIt is especially irritating that they start interrogating you over your work hours, as if they get to decide how tired you are allowed to be when not serving as a tool of their will.\n\nThe mistake is offering to watch their kids that first time. They become like the crocodile in Peter Pan. They must have more! More ! More!", "And one of the three is her husband, the other two are her close friends.  So she's bearing the consequences of having children for the night.  Part of being childfree is being child *free*, you get to go to the concerts.\n\nI imagine if it was just the friend and friend's husband going out, it wouldn't hurt as much.", "I don\u2019t think you should tell her \u201cin a pinch\u201d I really think you should say something more like \u201ca serious emergency that is involving a life or death situation where you have no other options.\u201d Or something else as clear where you say that going out with friends does not constitutional as \u201cbeing in a pinch.\u201d", "I\u2019m a psychiatric nurse, too. Child free by choice. The last thing I want to to after work is more caretaking responsibilities. It sounds like you feel left out of activities a lot and get seen as a babysitter instead of a friend. I am guessing you maybe would like your husband to prioritize spending time with you, alone? I\u2019m glad you can say no. I think you need to direct your friend to find her own babysitters going forward. Even if you don\u2019t want to attend the concerts. Working 12-13 hour days in a psychiatric hospital is a long day and many non healthcare workers just don\u2019t get the physical and emotional toll it takes.", "i think you've got to make her take your job in consideration. It's not cool at all that she insist if she's aware of your professional charge. You're very tired and it would'nt be responsible, to her to let her kids, and from you to accept. I'm sorry but this is not good parenting, and not good friendshiping (?). And your husband is TA too here : I bet he's very happy to go to those concerts with his friends at your expense"]}
