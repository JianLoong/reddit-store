I just want to add here, that I really love babies, so when I meet them, the girl was 2 mo. and I absolutely adore her, and I still do.\n\nMy husband, friend and wife share the same musical taste. Last year she (wife/friend) got tickets to a concert. I offered to take care of the kids so she, hers and my husband could enjoy the concert together. I went to their place after work ( 5 p.m.) and it was fine, putting aside the fact that I was exhausted, and the kids went to bed almost at midnight. \n\nFast forward to today, I have been asked a few times if I can take care of the kids so they all 3 can go to concerts. I have said no to all of them. I do not know why but this upsets me a lot, not in a way that I get angry, but it does affect my mood. I am a very straightforward person and luckily, I know how to say no. At the end of last year, the husband asked me, and I said no because of work and I\u2019ll be tired, he started asking me what time I was working, (I answered him) which he said it was not too early and that I would still rest. I shut him down as I don\u2019t have to explain myself. Unfortunately, because of this, my friend (his wife) did not go to that concert.\n\nThis year my friend asked me again if I could take care of the kids. She said something along the lines: \u201c2 things: would you like to go to a concert, or would you be able to stay with the kids\u201d (this rubs me the wrong way for some reason). I said I have plans already and to ask my husband if he wanted to do it. Her husband was working that day btw and my husband ended up looking after the kids.\n\nSo, today I have been asked again. There is a concert that my husband and the two of them are going. She knows I am working a long shift (7 am till 8:30 pm). She asked if I would consider going to their house after work and being there till midnight when they come back. That they are DEFINITELY paying (it has never been about the money), she added that she knows I am honest and that I should not feel obligated to do it.\nI have been vocal with my husband about how it bothers me to be asked to look after the kids every time they want to go to a concert, my husband does not get why I get upset and that I should simply say no and that is it. But I do feel that it\u2019s taking a toll on the friendship. I know they asked me because they trust me, and their kids like me. My friend (f37) is wonderful, she is nice and has been there for me always, she is overall a very sweet and caring person, but I do not like the situation that I have been put on. One thing is to offer and other things if to be asked every time they want to go out to this concert.\n\nSo, REDDIT, AITH?", "created_utc": 1684928711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qj6nx/aita_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_friends/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why can\u2019t they hire a babysitter or ask a family member like any other couple would?", "You are NTA. \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. If they don\u2019t have parents or relatives nearby who can babysit, that\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s theirs. Whether they offer to pay you or not, all you have to do is politely decline and be done with it. \n\nYou do have a bit of a husband problem, as this is his friend and that friend\u2019s wife. He should probably stand up and say that the babysitting service is over and that they should stop asking you.", "NTA - they need to figure out all this without asking you. You've repeatedly told them no. You need to tell them to stop asking you because you're not doing it. Finding childcare and providing it for them is not your problem it's theirs. Your husband also needs to stop bothering you about this.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand why people would assume you would just watch their kids.  6yo and 2yo are very demanding, it's effectively a job the whole time.", "NTA - your feelings are valid. It sucks to not be invited out along with friends because they value you more as a servant than a friend.", "NTA\n\nIf its making you feel like this and putting strain on your friendship it's clear it's not working for you and will cause future issues.\n\nIf it was me personally I would try ease into a conversation about how stressed you are with work and that you would appreciate no more requests for babysitting. If she learns that it's stressing you out and could put a strain on your friendship she might back off a bit.\n\nShe sounds like a good friend from what you described. So I think discussing it with her before it becomes an issue in the friendship would be a good idea.", "Not the AH. You don't have kids and you don't work as a babysitter. \nIf the relationship is really close between you just go with a straight:\n\"Are you crazy? 13 hour workshift AND babysitting until midnight, getting home and ready for bed at 1:00am instead of sleeping to go to work again at am?! I don't think so!\"\n\nIf you are more polite than my group of friends and me, go with:\n\"-_- I'm working a 13hour shift that day. The only thing I'm babysitting is a glass of wine, my bathtub and Morpheous (god of sleep). Maybe you should consider hiring a professional babysitter.\"", "NTA You're being taken advantage of. You need to tell them firmly to get a babysitter and to never ask you again. If they can't respect that then perhaps it's time to end the friendship and block them.", "Hmm I say NTA. I think it\u2019d be worth communicating with your friend, \u201cif you are in a pinch I don\u2019t mind you asking me to babysit but you need to look elsewhere for reliable, consistent childcare options outside of myself\u201d", "Nta\n\nNot your kids not your responsibility.

If it's going for a long time, why won't they hire babysitter?...\n\nAnd what about you? Your husband and his friends keep having fun and push you away to stay at home with children.", "NTA.  Why dont you talk to your husband about how it bothers you that the 3 of them swan off to concerts and leave you home like Cinderella?  Would you like to go with them?  Express your feelings.", "NTA\n\nTell them to hire a babysitter.", "NTA. Just tell them to stop asking.", "NTA. Some people think the word 'No' is just the opening bid on an answer which will lead to a \"Yes'.Tell her no and that is final. No explanation necessary.", "NTA, are you a friend or maid? Because it sounds like there is an expectation for you to be their servant whenever there\u2019s a concert. No means no.\n\nYour husband is also TA for not stepping in.", "NTA, and that \"two options\" comment puts your friend in the AH zone. \n\nYour friends are not entitled to your time.

But you have a unnatural hate for it.", "Info: Do they ever ask you to go out the four of you, or ask your husband to babysit so you can go to a concert with them? Or do a girls night with her?\n\nI can't fully get why it bothers you so much.", "This! OP, You said you\u2019re comfortable saying no, so by extension, it\u2019s time to tell friend the root of the problem.", "I think that's why the request bothers the OP so much. \n\nShe is being asked to do more work, watching two young children, after a long day at work. While the other three people waltz off to a concert and have an enjoyable time. \n\n\"Here, we're going to go have fun. Can you watch the kids for us?\" Lots of people would feel resentful at hearing that. \n\nOP may not enjoy these particular concerts, but that doesn't mean she should be babysitting.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m actually surprised that this keeps happening. The fact that she has no family here also might be one of the reasons. But as you mentioned, it is putting a strain on our friendship and I don\u2019t want that to happen. She knows my job (I work in a mental health hospital), she knows how stressful it is, and the fact that I will be working that day. I\u2019m going to have the conversation that I was avoiding. Thank you for your input.", "Thank you! I just feel like every time I said no it creates some sort of mutual resentment, maybe? From her side because as I friend I refused to babysit and from my side because I keep being put in this awkward situation. I came here to see if I was the AH and because I want to tell her in a really nice but firm way to stop asking and that if I ever feel like it, I would offer myself to babysit like I have done it in the past (apart from emergencies that I would be there without the need of being asked).", "To be completely honest I would not go because I do not even know these bands so it does not bother at all that they all go to the concerts. It\u2019s more about the expectation of me to watch over the kids just because I don not like these bands and I won\u2019t go. Just want to clarify that my husband does not expect me to watch their kids but does not understand why I get upset when they asked me. That\u2019s why I came here and see if I was being the AH.", "To be honest I would not use the word hate. I love my friend, I just don\u2019t like to be seen as the default babysitter. It bothers because I have said no every time they asked me due to work or having other commitments. The fact that she is aware I will be working that day for 13.5 hrs and she knows how my job takes a toll on my physically and mentally (I work in a mental health hospital and I have talked to her about it) upsets me.", "No, they haven\u2019t ask. It is just assumed that because I don\u2019t like this type of music I would not go and they are 100% right. Nevertheless I feel like I have been seen as the default babysitter because of this reason. I think it bothers me because of the fact that I\u2019m doing a 13.5 hours shift that day and they know it, I work in a psychiatrist hospital and my job is not easy. And even thought I don\u2019t have an issue saying no I think if this keeps happening it would affect the friendship and this is something I don\u2019t want it to happen."]}
