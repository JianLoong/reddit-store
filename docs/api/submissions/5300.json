My dad made all the money and she would just do random side jobs where she would get paid by cash. She mainly babysat other people's kids or go to other people's homes and take care of their kids while they worked. In middle school, my parents got divorced. So it's just been me, her, and my younger sister. She managed to get by with child support, food stamps, low income financial help, and babysitting on the side.\n\nMy mom started gambling because her friends would boast about how they would go to the casino and win money. I would help pay some bills by spotting her from time to time. However she would ask me for money and then go to the casino with it and when she would lose she would ask for more money. This went on for a few years. I was young and stupid and trusted my mom. Eventually she ended up maxing out credit cards, pulling out multiple loans, and ended up taking out a home equity loan without my knowledge. \n\nOnce I finished college, I moved back home and got a job nearby. I helped with bills but this time I would only pay it if I saw the bill. I mainly paid online with my card. Never giving her cash anymore.  Fast forward to Oct 2020, the home equity loan matured, and she's freaking out because she's fixing to lose the house. It was $50k and she needed to pay back $53k. She's constantly crying and gaslighting me for money and now she wants me to take out a 50k loan to pay off this loan so she can keep the house. I had enough. I told her this is all her fault and that this is what she gets for listening to her friends. So I ended up buying a house and moving out with my sister.\n\nWell, she ended up selling the home and made enough profit to pay off the 50k loan and have money left over. Eventually, she ended up spending all that money. She ended up finding a small cottage to stay at from a friend's friend. She's always begging me to let her come live with me and my sister. I told her no for my sanity. My home is my happy place. \n\nNowadays she only calls when she needs money and says things like \"How can you let your mom live like this\" or \" I raised you all these years and this is how you treat me.\" My sister and I vividly remember her saying mean things to us when we were little. She would say things like, \"I wish you would hurry up and die so I don't have to take care of you anymore.\" It's just so upsetting because my mom used to be so good at saving money and paying the bills on time. But it was because someone provided the money not her making money. She's been off and on with jobs at fast food restaurants. She'll only stay at them for 3 months and then quit. She refuses to work for Vietnamese people because they will \"scam\" her even though she can communicate with them better.\n\nI moved out of state for work, and she's still calling and begging for money. She makes tons of excuses and asking for thousands of dollars.

This is one of those situations where the right answer probably feels awful. You can\u2019t fix your mom and she is a money pit that refuses to fix her life. Going NC is probably the best option, but of course up to you.", "Don't driwn yourself to keep your mother afloat. She's not poor. She has a gambling addiction. It won't matter how much money you give her, she will go waste it again and be surprised that it's all gone so soon yet again. \n\nGood on you for not going into debt to help her out of a hole she dug herself into. I understand the guilt because it's your parent, but not all parents are good people. \n\nNtA. Block her calls for a while so you have some peace and she can realize that you are not her atm.", "NTA. Your mother has a gambling addiction, giving her money is NOT going to fix that.", "NTA at all, not even a little bit. Please stop having guilt over this. You did way more than you should have, and you shouldn't do another thing for her. Don't let her pull the \"but I'm your mother\" card because that's nonsense. That's not how a mother should act. Instead of helping her with money, you should spend that money on some therapy so you can work through the trauma she no doubt caused you, and practice setting boundaries with people and stuff. Although honestly, I think your best bet is to just go no- contact with your mother. Be grateful she didn't fuck you up worse and that you're doing well in life, but recognize that she's toxic and you're not required to keep her in your life. Best of luck \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n Your mom is an adult with no disabilities, most single mothers world wide are able to work and provide for their children and still give them a decent upbringing. It is not a child\u2019s duty to provide for their parents throughout their whole life. Although caring for your parents once they are old and sickly is somewhat expected, taking loans and paying bunches of bills for your middle-aged parent is not normal.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to finance her gambling addiction. I think you did well for yourself and your sister by moving out and getting your own place. Helping her with bills only frees up her own income to blow at the casino. Hopefully at some point, she will seek counseling for the gambling problem. Bailing her out will not help anyone.", "NTA but just block her.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother's gambling addiction caused this issue.

Not only do you not owe her for raising you, but if you were to continue to financially support her through this it would just be enabling her. She is an adult and it is completely reasonable that she be expected to care for herself. You do not owe her anything and prioritizing your own safety and wellbeing is not something you should feel guilty for, especially when there's no indication that she will ever take steps to take care of herself if she can have someone else take care of her.", "NTA\n\nDo not set yourself on fire for her. Continue to take care of yourself and your sister. Your mother must learn from her choices.", "NTA - my dear you have done too much already. Kudos to you for saving your little sister \ud83d\udc9d. Your mom needs help for her gambling addiction, giving her money would only make it worst.", "NTA\n\nIt is likely that your mother will get pretty desperate for money to gamble when you cut her off. Please make sure your credit is safe in case she gets the bright idea to use your credit for gambling money. You simply can't trust addicts to make wise decisions, and in this case it's much better to be safe than sorry. \n\nI don't know where you are, but in the US you can freeze your credit, and I would suggest doing so if possible. Here, using someone else's credit is fraud and you can't heal your credit without a police report accusing your mother with identity theft and fraud, which is a felony. Make sure your sister does the same.", "NTA.  You're not a financial advisor, you're not a gambling addiction therapist, and you're not her caregiver.  Go LC or NC and let this go.  You tried to help, and she didn't want the help.  She still doesn't want real help, she just wants a bail out so she can go back to the casino.", "NTA and it sounds like it's time to go no contact with her and block all the ways she can communicate with you. She isn't healthy and is only hurting your mental health. \n\nIt's a parents job to provide the bare minimum when they have kids. We as kids don't have the option of saying if we want to be born or not, we also don't get to choose that family but we can choose if we want to stay in contact.", "NTA. I know this is absolutely heartbreaking for you. Had your mom tried her best and merely needed money to get by I wouId understand. But your mom has sadly made bad decision after bad decision. Your mom has serious money problems that you alone will never be able to fix. You need to save your own money and plan your own life. You\u2019re making the hard choice, but it\u2019s the right one.", "NTA. \n\nWith my mother it was a shopping addiction. I'd help her cover a bill she didn't have the money for, and the next day she'd be buying discount DVDs or something else equally unimportant. I stayed at home for years longer than I wanted out of hope that my help would get her into a better financial state. It didn't, and my mental health suffered for it.\n\nIt's more complex than that of course, but I've been NC for 7 years and it's made a huge difference.", "NTA. OP, I would text your mom, \"You need to get help for your gambling addiction, and remember that it isn't my job to take care of you. Get the help you need and stop trying to get me to fix your problems. I'm done being used as a piggybank.\" Then, block her. You don't need that in your life.", "NTA, except that ...\n\n>She's constantly crying and gaslighting me for money\n\n... you don;t know what \"gaslighting\" is.", "NTA.
