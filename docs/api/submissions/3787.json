My wife has gotten an amazing job opportunity and we will be relocating, most likely forever or at least for a very long time. Basically, my future wife wants to spend her life there (she\u2019s not Mexican, she\u2019s British). I am happy to move with her. But because I don\u2019t speak Spanish, I\u2019ll have a hard time finding a job so we agreed that I can be a stay at home husband for a while before we figure out what to do with my job. She\u2019ll be able to afford supporting the two of use and more. Basically, she works in a very specialised field that has a high demand and not enough applicants. \n\nMy wife has Ba in Spanish so she does speak Spanish fluently which allowed her to get this position. I\u2019m British and only speak English. \n\nWe will be living in a very good area, surrounded by a lot of other expats who speak English. \n\nRecently, Katie suggested that I should take up some Spanish classes to at least learn some basics. I said that I didn\u2019t fell that it was necessary. I said that we\u2019d be surrounded by expats anyway so there was no need.\n\nShe didn\u2019t think it was acceptable and argued that I wouldn\u2019t be able to integrate with the society and i counter argued that I wasn\u2019t planning on that anyway. That there\u2019s plenty that I can do with English only.\n\nShe asked how I was going to communicate with her potential friends if they didn\u2019t speak English. And I said that she\u2019d just translate or we wouldn\u2019t communicate, that I didn\u2019t have to be friends with all her friends.\n\nShe said she was disappointed in me but dropped the subject only to try again a few days later.\n\nI stood firm saying that I didn\u2019t feel learning Spanish would be of any use for me. She asked if it was okay for others to come to the UK And not speak English and I said to at was different and she knew it and people should speak lingua Franca. \n\nShe didn\u2019t appreciate it. She told me I was an ignorant asshole (she used a different word but you get the point) and she didn\u2019t know if I should be moving with her. She also told me we won\u2019t be expats but immigrants but I argued with her that it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nShe\u2019s really angry with me. I told my mate about this and they\u2019re split on this matter.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to learn Spanish?", "created_utc": 1670011721, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaw4o9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_learn_spanish/", "score": 2132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019ll be able to afford supporting the two of use and more. Basically, she works in a very specialised field that has high demand and not enough applicants. \n\nMy wife has Ba in Spanish so she does speak Spanish fluently which allowed her to get this position. I\u2019m British and only speak English. \n\nWe will be living in a very good area, surrounded by a lot of other expats who speak English. \n\nRecently, Katie suggested that I should take some Spanish classes to at least learn some basics. I said that I didn\u2019t fell that it was necessary. I said that we\u2019d be surrounded by expats anyway so there was no need.\n\nShe didn\u2019t think it was acceptable and argued that I won\u2019t be able to integrate with the society and i counter argued that I wasn\u2019t planning on that anyway. That there\u2019s plenty that I can do with English only.\n\nShe asked how I was going to communicate with her potential friends if they didn\u2019t speak English. And I said thag she\u2019d just translate or we wouldn\u2019t communicate, that I didn\u2019t have to be friends with all her friends.\n\nShe said she was disappointed in me but dropped the subject only to try again a few days later.\n\nI stood firm saying that I didn\u2019t feel learning Spanish would be of any use for me. She asked if it was okay for others to come to the UK And not speak English and I said to at was different and she knew it and people should speak lingua Franca. \n\nShe didn\u2019t appreciate it. She told me I was an ignorant asshole (she used a different word but you get the point) and she didn\u2019t know if I should be moving with her. She also told me we won\u2019t be expats but immigrants but I argued with her that it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nShe\u2019s really angry with me. I told my mate about this and they\u2019re split on this matter.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to learn Spanish?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
