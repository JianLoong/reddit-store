I get the feeling that your sister was hoping for some kind of validation at the con by being actually groped, catcalled, et cetera, because it would make her feel sexy and desirable and when it didn\u2019t happen she decided to seek validation from lying on TikTok SAYING it happened so at least she\u2019d not only get pity from viewers, but with every person who believed her that meant they must also agree that she is sexy and desirable enough to deserve such treatment (not to mention those schweet, schweet views, right?).\n\nHer accusations hurt real people who suffer from the trauma of these things actually happening to them when all they want to do is dress up as one of their favorite characters and show off their awesome costumes which often cost a great deal of money and can take an incredibly long time to make (not to mention many cosplayers actually make their own costumes and they take great pride in them). She may not have called out anyone in particular but her lies are damaging, nonetheless. She is (most likely unintentionally) spitting on the cosplayers who\u2019ve been brave enough to come forward about this issue, possibly costing them their livelihoods because they want to make it stop.\n\nI think you did the right thing and probably the same thing I would have done. You were standing up for the men (imaginary straw men, but men, regardless) who go to cons and actually respect the cosplayers and it\u2019s bad enough that those men have to exist in a negative light through no fault of their own because of the actual sexual assault-y, misogynistic troglodytes who see cosplayers as objects to put their hands on but now your sister made it even worse by adding fuel to a fire that was, unfortunately, burning just fine without her help.\n\nAgain, you are not the asshole, you have integrity and know when and how to stick to your guns. Never change.", "NTA. She is the one making a mockery of victims and setting the movement back decades, not you.", "NTA.  False claims don't raise awareness, they mock and hurt real victims.  Did sister want something to happen?  For the drama of it?  To hurt the scene?  What she did is on the same level as the creepers.", "Telling the truth isn't being an asshole.  NTA.  Lying and pretending to be a victim *is* being an asshole.", "NTA - it's good that you put a stop to it\n\nThat's a really common form of content that people make online, some valid, some attention-seeking, either way it usually results in a wave of addictive support and validation. That is to say, she may have internalised it as the 'normal' thing to post after going to a convention and not realise the implications of what she has done. (like teens with good home lives who say they have abusive parents, it's fucked up but comes from a place of wanting to fit in and feel community support). She's still an ass, but as your sister she deserves to be able to grow from it.\n\nShe's old enough to have a proper conversation about sexual harassment and why her actions weren't okay, and hopefully it won't happen again", "NTA.  What your sister did makes it SO much harder for people who ACTUALLY get harassed when they come forward, and for what?

When someone makes false accusations of sexual misconduct of any sort, it\u2019s not only harmful to the person being accused, it also makes it very difficult for anyone who has been a victim of sexual misconduct to come forward.", "NTA, and your sister is awful.

I've gone to conventions. I love seeing the cosplayers go all out; they're so proud of their work & they look amazing. The people are very well-behaved & are some of the nicest people you'll meet; they're nerds & geeks (I'm both, so they're my peeps). I feel safe in that crowd. Your sister is an attention-seeker. She didn't get what she wanted at the convention, so she got it from the Internet. Does she actually want to be sexually harassed? You did the right thing by those people. Shit like this ruins lives of the innocent & invalidates REAL victims. It's why men rarely believe women when we speak up about abuse.", "NTA. she is playing a part in the current man bashing society problem. and that by being a LIAR just to garner votes. the worst kind of social media wannabes\n\nnot even touching what that means to the cosplay community and the convention as a whole", "NTA sounds like shes attention seeking. The thing is fake accusations ruin the accused persons life while simultaneously damaging people who have had real experiences.\n\nEverytime someone lies, it gives ammo to real abusers to say that people that come forward are faking it, because \"look how often it happens in x y z cases\".\n\nSo you were absolutely right to call her out on it", "NTA\n\nShe is lucky that con organisers don't press legal action over her slandering the con.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds dangerously misguided and detracts from other victims struggle by attention seeking and muddying the waters with her lies. \n\nSome incel somewhere will love her behavior.", "You don't understand her feelings?

It is despicable and perpetuates the cycle of disbelief for people who have actually experiences assault or abuse.  Not to mention potentially destroying an innocent person's life.  NTA.  I really hope she learns the lesson she should from this, but based on her reaction, I doubt it.", "NTA but.. poor guys getting their lives ruined due your sister wanting attention.

You might think your situational awareness is that good, but I can tell you most people's usually isn't.\n\nIt's a split second of brushing their hands over your butt when you're turned away or their arm \"accidentally\" against your breast or a hand to the small of  your back to \"move\" you. Not everything is overt. \n\nAnd when it happens you have 2 choices.\n\n1) you can make a scene and hope people believe you. Since her own brother doesn't coz \"he didn't see it so it doesn't  happen\" how well do you think this one works with strangers? And some dudes get violent when they're called out. \n\n2) you can stay silent and keep the rage and disgust inside and move away from the creep to stay safe a D not ruin your con experience.. And then vent to your friends when you get home to help you process the rage and disgust. \n\nWhen your brother calls you a liar though, that's the opposite of helping you process.

She the most though. Lying about that kinda a thing is just such a shit thing to do.

What's the point of that other then just you getting more likes and comments.\nJust tell her in person and leave it at that.", "I think you completely mishandled this. You don't know for certain she lied. Instead of talking to your sister about it and asking how she was and finding out more about what she claimed, you straight away assumed as accused her of lying. Then without actually knowing what is true, you publicly called her a liar. She could be lying or she could be telling the truth. You went nuclear on your own sister online and publicly. That makes YTA.\n\nIf she is lying it would be ESH.", "NTA. Those who make false accusations of SA and harassment are the ones who make actual victim's lives hardest, and from the sounds of it she is literally lying and inventing her own victimhood for clout.  \nEither way, since \\*clearly\\* she had such a traumatizing time, you should \\*never\\* take her to a con again. You wouldn't want her to endure such misogyny a second time, since she got harassed so badly whenever you blinked.", "Your sister is lucky she didn\u2019t actually falsely accuse someone\u2026 she\u2019d be faced with legal actions.

But the situational awareness thing isn't gendered.. I used to work as security. Even when you're looking for it you can miss it. Maybe your sister is lying. And maybe something happened and she's ashamed to tell you or didn't want to make you feel like you didn't protect her or something. I dunno, jumping to her lying immediately doesn't make sense to me, but I don't know your sister. Does she have a habit of making things up?", "yes", "Absolutely agree. It's vile and it needs to be called out.\n\n I just might be oldfashioned and don't see the point in doing so online. Op should call out sister, tell their folks etc. Because that is not OK. I'm only questioning why this has to happen via social media/internet.", "You said you accused her of lying, not talk to her in an non judgmental way.
