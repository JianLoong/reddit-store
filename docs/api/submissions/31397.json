There's usually 10-12 kids enrolled as I'm the only one who's regularly there. I have a part time helper 2x a week. \n\nThe kids are ages 7-10 and most have known each other since kindergarten or younger. There is one new kid, joined in August, Matt, he's 9, white, and has some mild/moderate special needs. There's one black kid in the program, Ben, he's been with me since he was old enough to join, he's 10.\n\nBen is a difficult child and constantly seeks attention. He tends to aggravate the other kids in the program. The rest of the kids usually take it with a grain of salt because they're used to Ben and get that's how he is. Ben does not particularly target Matt anymore than he does the other kids and even then it's kid stuff. Things like knocking books off the desk, slapping pencil out of another kid's hand, thumping someone on the ear, smack on the back of the head, stepping on another kid's heels when walking behind them, etc. Matt took all of it personally and kept complaining about it, Ben did this, Ben did that. I encouraged Matt to ignore Ben, to go sit elsewhere, to sit by me if he really felt the need to.\n\nLast week the incident that led to me posting happened. Matt struggles a bit with coordination and balance, he gets up and down slower than the other kids. As Matt started to sit down, Ben grabbed the chair from under Matt so he fell and lost his balance hitting head on the floor. Ben started shrieking with laughter, I told Ben what he did was unkind and he needed to apologize. Matt lost it, between yelling and sobbing, he looked at Ben and very clearly said, you are a stupid black bully loser and I hate you!\n\nI understand kids will aggravate each other, but I absolutely do not tolerate any kind of racism or hatred in my program. Once I made sure Matt wasn't hurt I had him sit in a corner until his mom came. I took Ben aside and told him that no matter what it never justifies someone being racist and hateful towards him.\n\nWhen Matt's mom picked him up, I told her what transpired and Matt was expelled from my program. The mom was extremely apologetic and agreed there were many other ways Matt could have expressed his frustration and she's not going to argue with my decision.\n\nThe next day, my helper was in so I told her what happened and she disagreed with me. She said expelling Matt and not Ben was unfair as Ben had a long history of being the instigator where Matt only reacted to Ben's ongoing antics. My assistant said the only right choices were to either expel both boys or expel neither as by only expelling Matt would just reinforce to Ben his behavior is acceptable when it's not.\n\nMy assistant and I are both biracial and in our early 30s.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700541302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1808nbg/aita_for_expelling_child_from_my_program/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then why are you letting one child get away with bullying and physically attacking other students? Do you think his violence comes from love?\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: your blatant dismissal of Ben being a violent bully in the comments is a disturbing mindset for someone in charge of childcare.  You act like he's doing zero harm because when he slaps and hits other children you claim \"It's never a full out hit intended to hurt.\" and because he has a troubled home life,  his behavior is acceptable.  You reward him with extra attention and special treatment \"When Ben is genuinely upsetting the other kids, I have him sit at my desk with me or on a yoga ball where he's able to move around a bit and get that energy out on the other side of the room.\".  All the other kids are expected to \"brush it off\" because you're certainly not going to do anything about it. I'm surprised you're allowed around children.", "YTA I find the premise of this post a bit hard to believe, but for arguments sake, let's say it happened. You tolerate bullying by Ben but when Matt snaps because of your failure to address the problems with Ben, Matt gets expelled. Ben should have gotten the boot a long time ago. \n\n>Things like knocking books off the desk, slapping pencil out of another kid's hand, thumping someone on the ear, smack on the back of the head, stepping on another kid's heels when walking behind them, etc.\n\nSome people might consider this behaviour abusive but not you. Smacking other children on the back of their heads, so you think assault is okay?", "I doubt this is real but YTA. Ben isn't doing \"kid stuff.\" Ben is aggressive, mean, and at times violent towards other children. He has injured kids in the past and targeted Matt and basically all you did was tell Matt to suck it up. And then expelled Matt for awkwardly standing up for himself and even called him racist. His insult wasn't great but what did you expect when Ben has been cruel for days on end? \n\nAssuming this is real, Matt's mom or your assistant needs to report your program to the proper agency to be shut down before Ben seriously injures someone. None of what you described in Ben's behavior is acceptable or \"just kid stuff.\"", "YTA. Matt did not \"feel\" bullied he actually was being bullied. You don't get to decide what he experiences and how it affects him. Why have you let this kid Ben get away with his antics for so long? Pulling a chair out from under someone is no laughing matter, Matt may have seriously been hurt when his head hit the floor. I notice you say you are biracial - what has that got to do with any of this? Do you think this makes you particularly gifted in making decisions involving kids of different racial backgrounds? It doesn't. If I were you the correct reaction would have been to speak to Matt's mother about her son's language, with a warning that it won't be tolerated, and Ben would be suspended because of his continued bad behaviour. But everyone knows that there is no way Ben will ever face any disciplinary action because of the perceived optics, no matter how much he might deserve it.", "YTA. You are keeping a kid in your program who physically hurts others and could potentially get you sued. He does this repeatedly and you just say oh, that's not nice. You need to get this kid gone yesterday. And Matt didn't use any racial slurs, he said you are black, you said he was black ( hypocrite much), and a bully again you gave examples of his bullying. Things that make you say HMMMMMMMMMM. After reading all her comments, she needs to let all the other kids go and run a place of worship at the altar of Ben he can do no wrong in her eyes. A kid is going to get hurt bad and she will spin it to be the victims fault. This place needs to be shut down fast.", "YTA. You're giving Ben license to harm, bully, and annoy other kids. Do better.", "YTA- Ben could've had Matt land in the hospital or permanently injured with that chair stunt. And this bullying had gone for months.\n\nYes, racism is never right. However, you caused this by allowing Ben to continually bully Matt to the point where Matt couldn't hold it in anymore. Bullying is never right either and you let it go on.\n\nI agree with either expel them both or expel neither. You caused the situation to get this bad. And it sounds like Ben should've been expelled a long time ago with his constant bullying and physical violence.\n\nOh yeah, and when you told Matt's mom why he was expelled, did you tell her the full story about what Matt has been enduring or did you conveniently leave all that out and only gave that specific instance? I feel Matt's mom would be livid if she knew the full extent of what her son has been through.\n\nYou are lying just to make Ben seem like way less of an instigator just so you can have your decisions be agreed with.\n\nAt this point, your job and credentials are gonna be heavily in danger.", "You letting Ben be abusive?  YTA", "I agree with your assistant. From my point of view, it seems the only thing Matt did that Ben didn't was to call him black, which he is. Did Matt's words really hurt Ben more than Matt's potential concussion? Ben shrieked with laughter. You gently reprimanded him? Is there more to this that you're not telling. Expelling one kid, the victim of bullying, and not the bully does not seem right to me.\n\nYou stated \"I absolutely do not tolerate any kind of racism or hatred in my program.\" What is bullying if not hatred? Ben is a bully but you tolerate it. Speaking as one who was bullied frequently, YTA. The kind of resentment or emotional hurt that the other kids suffer at his hands is not visible but real nonetheless. And by letting Ben stay but expelling Matt you're just reinforcing Ben's behavior.", "yta for allowing ben's behavior to continue unchecked and then punishing matt for finally snapping. it's not fair to ignore ben's actions and then expel matt for reacting to them. both boys should have been held accountable for their actions.", "YTA.  Ben is a bully and abelist.  Matt hit is head on the floor, you are lucky he wasn\u2019t seriously hurt.  You should have talked to both boys and their parents about the incident before going with the nuclear option of explusion", "YTA - You allowed a bully to get away with things too long. Matt could have been seriously hurt, and you do not care because a 9 year old said something that perhaps may be construed as racist. Or may be an apt description. So, for Matt, it's one strike he is out, but Ben gets multiple chances because why? Ben IS a bully, and will end up hurting someone. I hope your insurance is paid up.", "YTA\n\nYou let one kid bully and physically harm another and then blamed a pretty young child for their reaction?? \n\nI hope the next time Ben injures someone their parents have an attorney. All the kids deserve better than what you're doing.", "Did you even checked on Matt? He could have a concussion and all you get from the incident is a white kid called a black kid black. YTA.", "What Ben did could have caused spinal cord damage to Matt, and you're choosing to ignore that.  That's really concerning.  \n\nYou're allowing Ben to get away with big shit and yet you expelled a kid who let out a bad choice of words out of frustration.\n\nMy choice would have been to expel Ben and maybe have Matt not come in for a week after a serious talking to.", "YTA - You shouldn\u2019t be allowed to watch over any kids if you accept bullying. Matt\u2019s mother should\u2019ve reached out to other parents to let them know you allow their children to be bullied too. Or taken it to the proper authorities.", "There\u2019s no excuse for tolerating Ben\u2018s behavior. It doesn\u2019t matter if the other kids are used to it, and in fact it\u2019s appalling that they\u2019re used to it. \n\nThe aggressive behavior he displays needs to be nipped in the bud. You downplay it as though it\u2019s not serious, but it certainly is. You\u2019re very lucky there have been no serious injuries. If left unchecked, his behavior will escalate to a point where it absolutely will be full out dangerous because he\u2019s not learning that it\u2019s not ok. I don\u2019t know what the focus of your program is, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not supposed to be enabling aggression & assault.\n\nOf course Matt took it personally. Of course Matt thinks Ben is a bully. He likely thinks you\u2019re a bully too, because you are. You\u2019re doing all of these kids, Ben included, a great disservice. If I were Matt\u2019s mom, I would be reporting you, & more. You absolutely should not be working with children in any capacity. YTA.", "YTA. Are you kidding me. You have a boy in your after-school-program who constantly targets other kids and being violent while doing so and you expell the kid who decides he had enough. People like you shouldn't be working in childcare, when you let such behaviors go on for such a long time that kids get used to being bullied and physically threatened. \n\nThis child is in your programm for several years and you think that Ben is just attention seeking. Something serious could be going on in this child's life that is the reason for his behavior. Have you ever got CPS or other authorities involved or at least had a talk with his parents? I can not believe that the other parents are happy with this situation.", "YTA\nif I was a parent of one of these kids I would want you FIRED ASAP!", "YTA. I cannot even believe what I\u2019ve read. This is shocking and scary that you\u2019re around children.", "YTA why are you allowing Ben to behave like this. No child should have to tolerate his bullying. Ben is the one who should be punished", "what qualifications do you have to be running this program? is your program licensed? \n\nyour incompetence is deeply harming every single child in your care and you should be ashamed of yourself. it is your responsibility to ensure the physical and emotional safety of every child and you have failed miserably. \n\nyour other students are not \u201cused to\u201d Ben bullying them. they have simply realized that you will always let Ben intimidate, harass, and physically harm them, and that it\u2019s a waste of time to reach out to you for help. \n\npoor Matt has been abused in your care for months by a bully that you enable. when he finally snaps while experiencing physical and emotional abuse and says something offensive, you decide that he does not deserve the grace that you have given Ben for his mistakes. have you ever considered that Matt said that because he was desperately trying anything and everything to get you to take meaningful action? he was screaming for help and you spit in his face.\n\nand now we get to how you treat Ben. this really hammers home how disingenuous and dangerous you are, and how you should not be in charge of any vulnerable children. you are actively hurting Ben and negatively shaping the rest of his life by not holding him accountable for bullying the other kids. you seem to already know that children who bully are usually children who have their own issues that they are struggling with. you don\u2019t seem to understand that when that happens, a child needs firm boundaries and consequences and guidance from a trusted adult to teach them how to be accountable for their actions, and to teach them healthier ways of dealing with conflict and their feelings. a light scolding and a timeout are horrifically inappropriate consequences for a years long pattern of hitting and humiliating other children for fun. you should be implementing real consequences that encourage him to reflect on his behavior and build empathy for others. why would Ben ever change his behavior if you make it abundantly clear to him that you don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of it? \n\nYTA and your ignorance is dangerous.", "YTA.", "YTA.

You are trying to dismiss everyone's concerns here. You do not know better than everyone. You do not understand that your favoritism, disguised as empathy, is going to deeply damage your business. Ben obviously has special needs, and your current method of dealing with him is not working. He has been violent (yes, that is the correct term) with other children. It is only a matter of time before he seriously hurts someone. OP, please listen to all the replies here.", "YTA. You did *nothing* to stop Ben's bullying of Matt. What you did reinforce to Ben is that he can get away with harassment and bullying of someone who is already vulnerable with zero consequences.

Wait, my bad, he hits these kids, you are charging them to have their kids assulted. Then when the bully assulted a special needs kid, causing him to hit his head, you punished the kid assulted.

So racism isn't tolerated in your program but bullying a kid for their disability is? Both are discrimination and only one involved physical violence.

That telling someone they're hurting them is racist if they're black? That they have to take people's shit or they would be the ones in the wrong? These kids don't just take it because they're used to him, they take it because they just gave up on the adult who's supposed to protect them while in their care to ever do what they're supposed to do, you made it very clear you don't give a shit what this boy does as long as no one's seriously physically hurt, and kids can pick up on that.\n\nYou said your self that the little boy has special needs, you seriously expect that same boy to deal with being bullied like an adult?\n\nWell he DID try to deal with it like an adult, he went to YOU, the adult who was supposed to help him, and what was your solution? That he needs to either suck it up or hide like a siner behind you all the time?

Of course not, he's white, he can deal with it!\n\nThe audacity you have to say you're against racism!! The hypocrisy!! If my kid was in that program and had to deal with your biased shit I would have made an official complaint against you along time ago! And the mother is another thing entirely!

You allowed him to repeatedly abuse a disabled child and then when said child had enough and defended himself with words you decided he was racist and kicked him out.

I DO NOT CARE OF YOU SAY HE ISN'T HITTING HARD ENOUGH TO HURT, PHYSICAL TOUCHING WITHOUT CONSENT IS ASSAULT AND BATTERY.  Instead of being part of the solution, you ensure the problem continues.  You will be part of the reason this young man ends up in prison one day, because instead of stopping him you allow it to continue.

This is his first offense, and while his words were completely unacceptable he is a child. He's likely just parroting something he heard someone else say.

There's usually 10-12 kids enrolled as I'm the only one who's regularly there. I have a part time helper 2x a week. \n\nThe kids are ages 7-10 and most have known each other since kindergarten or younger. There is one new kid, Matt, he's 9, white, and has some mild/moderate special needs. There's one black kid in the program, Ben, he's been with me since he was old enough to join, he's 10.\n\nBen is a difficult child and constantly seeks attention. He tends to aggravate the other kids in the program. The rest of the kids usually take it with a grain of salt because they're used to Ben and get that's how he is.

Things like knocking books off the desk, slapping pencil out of another kid's hand, thumping someone on the ear, smack on the back of the head, stepping on another kid's heels when walking behind them, etc. Matt took all of it personally and kept complaining about it, Ben did this, Ben did that. I encouraged Matt to ignore Ben, to go sit elsewhere, to sit by me if he really felt the need to.\n\nLast week the incident that led to me posting happened.
