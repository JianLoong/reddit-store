Feeling worthless and thinking badly of yourself go hand in hand with depression and ultimately aren't going to help her get better. So set boundaries, but do it kindly. Try to be mindful over whether she could genuinely be struggling with it and think how you could make it easier for her. That doesn't mean having to do everything for her. Something as simple as being with her and having a nice chat whilst she tidies up the mess could be really beneficial. I've depression myself, and sometimes just having someone physically there with me, having a chat, can be the boost I need to get things done.\n\nI'm going to say N A H, because this is a very difficult situation that you're all trying to navigate as best you can.

From what I've garnered, you haven't had to deal with this kind of mental health issues. Not ONLY this, but the WAY you described her depression further shows that you don't take this shit seriously. Clearly, it seems like you're blaming your ex for somehow \"giving\" your daughter depression and are now taking this out on her.\n\nAnswer me this: Are you her therapist? No?? Well then, you have no CLUE how it's affecting her. It is very well known at this point that people with depression often let the things in their life crumble because they LITERALY cannot force themselves to keep it together. Claiming \"well she could go outside\" is not, in the SLIGHTEST, comparable. \n\nIn the end, having a child struggle with issues you haven't faced can be very, very difficult. But you NEED to learn and adapt and help her out because, as a parent, it is your JOB to support her. Get it together.", "YTA. But soft YTA.\n\nShe is depressed, and that is different for everyone. Some people can't do simple tasks like cleaning, bathing, eating, or even getting up to use the bathroom. However those same people can go out with friends, watch yt, do well in school, etc etc.\n\nIt is a debilitating mental illness that affects everyone differently.\n\nShe isn't purposely being a bad kid, she just might be unable to care or unable to help or see w Gu\nThat she's doing is wrong.\n\nInstead of asking just her to do it, try to help her. She's struggling, and if she was physically sick and made a mess you'd probably help her clean it up right? This is the same thing, sick but mentally instead of physically.\n\nThe real part of this that made me change from NTA to YTA are these pieces:\n\n\n>Well it looks like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because now the kid has depression.\n\nYes, mental illness can be passed down genetically but that doesn't make it any less real. Don't blame the mother for passing on a mental illness, blame her for putting her child through so much stuff that she developed a mental illness that she was already genetically predisposed to. \n\n>I assume she bitched to her mother\n\nOk, if you're gonna have this kid around you for long, maybe watch what you're saying about her mother. Unless she doesn't like her mother, you could be causing a rift between you and her by having her choose sides. She's allowed to talk to other people about how she feels, it just so happens that is her mother. Saying she \"bitched\" is a very odd thing to use about a child talking to her mother. Regardless of how you feel about her mother, be careful that you're not fueling hate or making comments around the kid. She doesn't need to hear how her life and mom suck because I'm sure she already knows that. \n\n>Though admittedly I am not an expert on depression or mental health. \n\nNo one is at first, so instead of posting to reddit, perhaps you can look online at some resources or ask her about how she feels. \n\n>I don't put much value in my ex's partner's words since he is a generally unpleasant man who has gotten physical with me in the past and I honestly do not think a child should be in an environment around him, but I may be biased. \n\nThis is totally fair but then why do you think he should set up her therapy appointments, you already said he hasn't been in her life for long, so why expect him to do it. I'm not saying anyone should expect you to, as it should be the mothers job, but it seems you're the only trustworthy adult in this situation and you might need to. Additionally, if he set them up, who knows if he'll keep up with payments or keep up with taking her. \n\n>I do worry that I'm pushing her away somehow and making her side with her mother even though I don't see what I could be doing wrong.\n\nShe is confiding in the \"fun\" parent. You are unintentionally pushing her away by not trying to understand her. Mental health stigma is real and you need to look up resources to get over whatever issue you have with mental illness. This kid needs help and you're the only adult in her life who is trustworthy and responsible, she won't always agree with you and she won't always be happy. This may cause her to talk to her mom when she's unhappy with you. But you need to understand this is a complex situation for both of you, and that she needs love and support first and foremost. \n\nGood luck, please look up some resources and talk to her.", "YTA, to a degree. As you say, you clearly lack an understanding of how depression actually affects people. In general it means having very limited energy to put towards anything productive, and even \"simple\" things can be too much.   \n\n\nI don't know all the facts here, but it'd seem as though you're not offering much in the way of contrast against her relationship with her bio parents; it reads like you're treating her as a burden - that you don't care how she feels as long as she's carrying out your \"orders\", and that you expect her to just take care of herself without offering her any real help. Here, you were acting without compassion for her or her situation. I don't think it's a stretch to assume this isn't the first time you've left her feeling this way.\n\nYou'd do well to ignore anyone saying she's just using it as an excuse - they're full of shit. She's 13, and her life's been upended in several different ways. To put so much responsibility on a *child* for their entire existence and emotional wellbeing is fucked. If you actually want to help her here - and yourself - you'd benefit from cutting her a ton of slack, and picking it up yourself. That's what actual parenting is.\n\nBy no means am I saying \"clean up after her\" in the literal sense, or just let her make mess (and not just in the sense of and be fine with it. But she needs support, beyond meeting her basic needs. If you can't give her that, then you've no business trying to raise her.\n\nI'd recommend seeking therapy yourself. Even for people who aren't depressed or seemingly have no issues of mental health, it can be incredibly helpful. I'd hazard a guess that that isn't actually the case for you though - like you say, you lack an understanding of a mental health, and that doesn't mean you're perfectly fine in that respect. \n\nParenting isn't easy, and we don't all come pre-programmed with how to best go about it. You probably need someone other than reddit to address the difficulties therein, how it's making you feel, and how that's affecting your life as a whole - as well as that of your step-daughter, and the relationship between you.\n\nA big thing to address is how you communicate. I strongly recommend looking into Non-Violent Communication (Marshall Rosenberg, find the nearly 4h youtube video if you'd like to get a good understanding). The point of which is to avoid language that criticises, might evoke shame (something depressed people generally tend to feel an over-abundance of, especially if they've come from an abusive/neglectful situation in childhood), defensiveness or otherwise harm the relationship. \n \nA quick rule of thumb is to start phrasing things as requests, rather than demands - and if she declines in the moment, just allow it. The more you try and control a kid, the more they'll resent you. Do the parent thing, clean up the mess yourself - but address it with her later; set boundaries and expectations, and be gentle about it.\n\nThe other side of this is why you're taking responisbility for her and co-parenting in the first place - cause by all indications it seems you're not interested in actually rasing her, but maybe that's me reading too far into things. A question therapy would help address in any case.\n\nI hope this helps some.", "YTA  a person with severe depression and an unstable homelife who's likely also anxious all of the time, but can't verbalize it needs compassion.

However, her mental health should be addressed, I can't imagine a child that has already so much package can go easily trough puberty without professional help. And yes, she should clean up after herself, maybe if you happen to be in a similar situation again you could, if it's okay with you at the moment, ask her to do it later (a specific time, like ok then do it in 30 minutes please or something like that). I can only speak for myself but I've lived with depression since I was very little and for me it was a mayor nono to do things NOW, but if my mother for example told me \"hey I want you to clean up whatever, if you could start in 30/60 minutes that would be great\" it was-and is, still- much easier for me to do it, because I could get \"mentally ready\" to do a task or chore.

I have a father who blamed my mother for everything, and let me tell you, it is incredibly unhealthy. \n\nWant my experience? I HAVE depression. Depression isn't just your current state of mind: it is a mental disorder. It comes with highs and lows and is never the same between two separate people.\n\nYou asked, I gave you my answer. If you don't want to hear it, then don't come to this subreddit.", "Most people never know how bad it is until it's too late, or almost too late. \n\nA little over a decade ago I was severely depressed. I hated getting out of bed and doing all of the things. I did them anyway because I didn't want people to see how bad it was. Because I didn't want to be a burden when I already felt like a waste of space. My self-care was non-existent, save for showers and teeth brushing. My place was a mess, but I couldn't bring myself to clean. I just didn't have it in me after spending all day pretending I was \"normal\".\n\nOne night I poured all my sleeping pills into my hand and only stopped because someone in the house called my name. \n\nThe next day, I confessed what I'd almost done to my mum. She was shocked. She'd seen me every single day. She'd watched me closely because she knew I was depressed, and she still missed it. I hid it that well. It's called masking. \n\nSo yes, that little girl can be depressed and still go outside and do stuff, but her capacity for self-care, including cleaning up her surroundings is severely diminished. Please don't use the \"if you can do this thing, then you're capable of doing this other thing\". It's a harmful rhetoric and will only serve to make her feel worse than she already does. \n\nOffer to help her clean. Use that time to bond with her and become someone she can feel safe around. \n\nStop diminishing her illness because you can't see it and it's not presenting in the way you think it should. \n\nYTA, especially if you don't get that poor kid some proper help. Please try to be more compassionate to this kid. She is drowning. How will you feel if you continue to let her drown until it's too late to help her?", "Get this kid out of your 'care' immediately.", "Glad to hear that. And in general, yeah, I'd say the vast majority of people would benefit from therapy as long as they're open to it. It's a much harder sell for anyone in the US since it tends to cost quite a bit, but I digress.\n\nIn short it's access to someone whose *job* it is to look at your own mental health - your immediate mental state, your day-to-day challenges - such as co-parenting a depressed teenager. They'll help you to understand your own patterns of thought and behavior - particularly those which causes you difficulty; and where appropriate, help change some of those patterns. They're there to help you gain self-awareness overall, and a fairly objective view of any situation you find yourself in. Ultimately they're there to give you the tools, facilitate you in getting what you want out of life.\n\nThe important part is that they will do so from a place of emotional detachment, and without any judgement or criticism towards you (and if not, they're shit therapist - they're certainly out there but tend to be the exception). Not to mention they'll be academically accredited in some way, so it's very different from asking advice from or venting to a friend, family member or people on reddit, who might have their own agenda and biases, or might be projecting their own experience on to your situation. I can point to a few bits of my own post that are somewhat accusatory and come from a place of judgement, which isn't really helpful in addressing the issue you're having right now. So, sorry about that, and I'm relieved you chose to keep engaging with me in spite of that.\n\nSomething else I'd recommend reading up on is Attachment Theory. It's not directly related to parenting, but learning about it has helped me understand so much about my own mental health and where many of my own patterns of thought and behavior have come from - and what to do about it. Thais Gibson / Personal Development School on Youtube is a good place to start, mostly focused on romantic relationships (as is AT as a whole) but it all has its roots in upbringing and one's relationship to their parents - and she does have a few videos on parenting specifically.\n\nAnother couple channels I'd recommend are Doc Snipes and Dr. Daniel Fox  - both are excellent for covering broad mental health topics in fair detail, the latter is more focused on Borderline Personality Disorder and directed towards the people suffering with it. Patrick Leahan and Kati Morton as well.\n\nNone of them compare to having a therapist specifically there for you, but they'll help you get a good understanding of the concepts they're working from and importantly, what your daughter might be going through and how to support her.", "You're fine OP.\nYou literally are still providing shelter and care for her after the relationship has ended with her mum", "You aren't doing a great job either.", "When I was in the pit of despair I had a family member calling me daily to talk me into getting out of the bed and taking a shower, because just doing that felt like dragging myself through waist-deep quicksand.", "Somewhere else.", "Is your ex in treatment right now?

It would be a new experience anyway. I had a bit of a mindset that it was like going to the doctor only when you feel there\u2019s something wrong with you, but perhaps that\u2019s outdated thinking.

It\u2019s a numb sort of constant grief that steals your motivation, and leaves you feeling empty. So, I\u2019m suspecting she\u2019s also exhausted. Soul-tired.", "And frankly if her room was messy and not so much so that it risked damaging the place or attracting vermin, I might be more inclined to let that go (while also seeking treatment for her - which you definitely should).  But wrecking up a shared space and expecting you to clean it up is not ok, depression does not give her the right to demand you follow her around cleaning up messes she makes.", "Something to remember as well is that she is also going through puberty and hormones can have similar impact. In general that age is just not a good time for many girls and people tend to struggle with self image etc.", "Being a parent is hard, man. I get that. Just take some time. Research how depression affects people, ESPECIALLY young girls. You can do this. It just requires patience.", "Are you willing to actually care for a depressed teenager? If not, pass her on. To foster if you think that is best.", "One way to think of both medical doctors and therapists is the same as a mechanic - you take your car in to get serviced regularly, just as much to detect and diagnose problems before they become more serious, as to address ones you've already identified. So why not the same with your body and your mind?  \n\n\nSomeone also recommended men's groups and these can be great. Believe it or not, you need emotional support & validation, especially in a situation like this, and there are few places other than therapy and these sorts of groups to get it. Of course, as with reddit, take any advice you get with a grain of salt. That said, just to have people with no direct emotional investment in your situation listen to what you're going through can make a huge difference. \n\nBack to the situation at hand - with what you've learned from everything everyone's said here - in your SD's position, how would you feel, and what would you want from you? Keeping in mind she can't just choose to leave this situation.\n   \nTo reiterate, accommodating and supporting her doesn't mean having no boundaries and letting her get away with behavior you find unacceptable. But it'll be much more constructive to set and enforce those boundaries with kindness and consideration - particularly if you approach having those conversations in a more neutral situation where everyone's relatively calm. And yeah, if she indicates in a given scenario that she's just not up to whatever you're asking, letting her off to do what she feels she needs to do most will always be worth serious consideration.", "Op, another way to look at therapy for yourself -- caregiver fatigue. The post above I think gets at this (and many other important points) well, but I wanted to articulate it s little differently.\n\nYou may not feel it now, but being the carer is hard. Caring for a sick spouse, child or parent, whether cancer, a stroke, depression, any of it, can wear you down and you can feel like you have no one to listen to you. You can feel like the focus has to be on the unwell person and you feel selfish for being frustrated, but carers need support, too. Caregiver depression and fatigue is really common and it can even take a physical toll on your health. Therapy for you can be a proactive way to create your own support structure, and get ahead of some of those challenges.\n\nThis might not happen to you and this might be getting ahead of things!

It took my folks about 10 years to get to that point, so you\u2019re ahead of the game! \n\n13 is a tough age in the best of circumstances. If you haven\u2019t already, gently confirm if she\u2019s experiencing thoughts of self-harm. I encourage you to take her to the pediatrician, from whom you will get a referral for a psychologist (talk doc) and/or psychiatrist (medicine doc).

But just a pain that is dull but very noticeable and laying down subsides it. \n\nSo cleaning feels like a literal drain. \n\nBut depression also can\u2019t be an excuse. Make sure she has a medium sized trash can in her room to throw her trash into. And bathroom too and keep a stack of paper plates and utensils because some times, even taking dishes downstairs is a pain and I\u2019d rather let them pile up than go downstairs. \n\nBut don\u2019t let her drown in trash or go without taking care of herself, it\u2019ll be harder to move forward without support but also without an ounce of motivation from oneself. \n\nI\u2019ve had depression since 9years and am 21 next month, so it\u2019s not just being \u2018lazy\u2019.

What are you offering these kids instead?", "That\u2019s not good advice, I suggest you disregard whatever it is they\u2019re trying to say. depression is still not an excuse. You are a good parent you\u2019re here taking advice on how to help her. Just remember her depression is not an excuse to be lazy and to just not listen to what you\u2019re saying she shouldn\u2019t be using that as an excuse next time, maybe clean with her. You could also sit down and have more talks with her sometimes about how she\u2019s feeling if she would like that also.", "Are you willing to parent her? ETA: like take control and adopt her level of parenting?", "I happen to have recently gone through this process with elementary school, so I don\u2019t imagine middle school would be much different:\n\nOur kid mentioned thoughts of worthlessness and self harm. This is an all hands on deck situation. The next morning, we reached out to teacher via email, explained what we were told and asked to set up a time to talk. Teachers have their own action plans in place, so teacher engaged school therapist and guidance counselor. Meeting scheduled. \n\nSame day we reached out to pediatrician. Saw dr, explained situation, got referrals. \n\nReached out to insurance. Husband has EAP, so we get some additional benefits, such as six counseling sessions at zero cost. They provided a list of covered counselors and psychiatrists.\n\nHad the meeting. At this, we all talked about what had happened in the week or so since we set the meeting. Talked about the 504, which is really cool. Basically, it\u2019s a document that will follow your child through school, and if there are minor accommodations, you don\u2019t have to explain it over and over and over every year. They told us there are possible credits for private school if that\u2019s deemed necessary, lots of good info. We brought the list of counselors from insurance, as well. \n\nResearched counselors. We had a session last week, as the first session is counselor and parents. We were *extraordinarily fortunate* that we landed with a winner on our first go, the counselor is wonderful and we think a perfect fit for our kid. Not every therapist is right for every person (I know this from personal experience, as well). Kid had first appt with counselor next week, as we go from there.\n\nThis has all take about 4-5 weeks. During this time we have also made a lot of changes at home. Once we knew what was up (kid was very good at hiding bad feelings) we made that top priority in our household. We are cognizant of how we are talking and when, checking in way more frequently, incorporating more physical activity, and, frankly, spoiling just a bit. Kid deserves a treat because they definitely aren\u2019t worthless. \n\nHope any of this helps!!", "It\u2019s interesting to me that emotional issues will actually cause brain chemistry to be imbalanced.

I used to be incredibly smart with an infallible memory. I never learned to take notes because I never needed to - I didn\u2019t have a photographic memory, but I retained facts very easily and quickly grasped complex concepts. \n\nNow, my memory is shot. If my boss asks me to do something, I have to write it down immediately or I\u2019m likely to forget it within a minute or two. I have mild aphasia when I used to be a spelling bee champion. I have to read complex things over and over and over before I can grasp them (if I can grasp them at all). I am 45 years old and I could not tell you how I celebrated birthdays 41-44, or frankly if I even celebrated them at all. I simply can\u2019t remember. I only remember my 40th because i took a solo trip internationally and that was my first time doing something like that.
