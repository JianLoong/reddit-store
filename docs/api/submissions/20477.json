While my leg has healed relatively well, I still walk with somewhat of a limp and occasionally use a cane. I try to be active, but have accepted that I will never move like I used to again.\n\nBecause of my injury, I've been limited in how many sports I could play with my son (M15) but have spent time with him in other ways. I recently got back into hiking (an activity my son also enjoys) and invited him to join me on a short hike on a trail a short drive from our house this weekend.\n\nAs my son just started summer vacation, I was really looking forward to the bonding experience. My son was also initially excited to go but seemed to become less enthusiastic as the date got closer. \n\nYesterday, I got back from work a little earlier than usual. I could hear my son in the basement playing video games and chatting with a few of his friends. I don't think they realized that I was home.\n\nI set up in the living room to do some paperwork when I heard one of my son's friends ask him if he was going with them to the cinema this weekend. My son declined and stated, 'I can't, I have to take my crippled dad to see birds and shit.'\n\nHearing him say that hurt, but then he continued into how boring the experience would be and how slowly I would be moving. He made several more comments about how I'm 'learning how to walk' and how he and my wife need to give me encouragement like I'm some sort of toddler. I could not concentrate on my work anymore, so I just sat there feeling upset and furious.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, they came upstairs. I think they could all sense I was angry as all my son's friends said goodbye before heading out. My son asked me then what was wrong, so I told him what I heard him saying.\n\nHe said that it was out of context and not representative of what he actually thought. He apologized and said that he was just making a few jokes for his friends. He then mentioned how it was tough being the only one in his friend's group with a dad like this.\n\nThis only made me feel more hurt and annoyed so I told him that he was an idiot for being the only person in his group that who would make such jokes about their own father, and I said that he had a sick sense of humor. My son apologized again, and my only response was asking him to leave me alone. He went into his room, closing the door. \n\nMy wife came back from work later, and I told her everything. She was mortified by our son's words but thought my reaction was excessive. I haven't spoken with my son since we had that argument.

I feel like most parents would give some sort of material punishment in 2023. \n\nTeens are more self aware than adults think  though. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come back with a sincere apology soon. I\u2019m also sure he knows he\u2019s in hot water and he\u2019s planning to lay low for a bit. He likely knows he\u2019s not gonna get any favors from you for awhile, possibly the entire summer.", "NTA. I would not take him to the trip and ground him so he can\u2019t go to the cinema either. He should be proud of you or at least not ableist towards you. I will never understand people like him who a close person with disability and are still acting like ableist jerks.", "NTA - at 15 I would never have been so disrespectful towards either of my parents Infront of my friend. Yes he\u2019s young, yes he\u2019s a teenager - but it\u2019s not excuse and I\u2019m not sure why these other comments are suggesting his son wasn\u2019t so in the wrong and awful for what he said. It shouldn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s a teenager infront of his friends. \nI don\u2019t think you overreacted. Your circumstances are personal and sensitive to you and you should be able to express them how you wish. This being said, I would have another chat with your son when he is by himself and calmly and positively let him know how you\u2019re feeling about what was said and why you were so upset with him. Hear him out and see if you can make amends. \nYour son was awful for this - but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a monster and I think hearing him out is the best thing to do here, and maybe getting him to think about how he\u2019d feel would the shoe be on the other foot", "NTA - he needed to be cut down a notch. It wasn't just a single comment but it sounds like he went on a bit making fun of the disability. Sure teens can be edgy but  teens also typically learn trying to be edgy and cool can have consequences. That's what happened here. He tried to be cool in front of his friends and now it backfired a bit because now he has to answer for his so-called jokes. Confronting him was the right thing to do because this is an important teenager learning moment. I don't think you went too overboard so far but I would reopen dialogue with him soon.", "NTA. What your son said *was* horrible, cruel and hurtful. Yes, teenagers are immature and given to saying things without thinking, especially around their friends, however, they need to face the consequences of those actions if they are to learn and mature. Your son needs to learn that words can injure people just as much as anything physical can, and that it isn't right to make fun of someone's physical issues, major or minor. Also, he needs to understand that your injury is far more tough on you than it is on him, and he needs to be empathetic and think about others and to be less selfish. All of this is typical teenage behavior, but he won't learn differently unless he faces up to the harm that behavior does.\n\nI think the real trick here is not that your son did this once, but, going forward, does he learn from this.", "NTA. I\u2019m a firm believer in letting kids know they hurt your feelings. Especially this old. Calling him an idiot was a lot, I would apologize for that bit. But what he said was cruel and unacceptable. Jokes are meant to be funny, not to tear down a minority group. The word he used to describe you is also extremely derogatory, and has no place in his vocabulary.", "Nta. And I doubt it was outta of context.  I'd be furious and hurt.", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you punished your son. You didn't ground him or anything. What you did was point out that he was clearly the only one ridiculing a parent, it was ridicule that framed you as a mental invalid or lazy, and he was just...going off about you. That isn't something that can be overheard and walked back with an, \"I'm sorry, and it was heard out of context.\"\n\nYou're a human being and you've every right to be hurt, even devastated, to hear how someone you love really thinks about you when they think you're not listening. Frankly if you need time to forgive, or can't, that doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nI'll also add that I feel like this is an important learning moment for your son. One of the hardest, and harshest, lessons to learn as a teen is that of empathy. Your son is still in that mindset that you can just...apologize and it's like putting a coin into a vending machine and yielding a soda. He doesn't quite grasp that no matter the context his words have hurt you, deeply, and that he can't just walk that back with an, \"I'm sorry.\" This is important, because waaaay too many teens get to early adulthood and people give them excuses for not knowing that actions have lasting consequences some how.", "kids at that age shit talk like nobody's business, esp with friends. he likely in his head wanted to save face for not being part of whatever video game plans they had. \n\nyour nta for having feelings and this def sucks all around. id just hope you can get past this quickly", "NTA. I don't think I would be able to look him in the face for a couple of months after that.\n\nLike the old joke goes; I am completely opposed to child abuse, but I understand what turns Mr. Hand into Mr. Fist.", "NTA. this is a lesson your son clearly needed to learn. If he thinks friends need to hear him be cruel and insult his own father let alone for his disability, he's making stupid choices in friends. You have feelings too, and you're entitled to express them when they're being stepped on.", "NTA. The comments he made were incredibly cruel and humiliating and you have every right to be hurt OP.", "First of all congrats on your recovery.  It's real easy to get discouraged and spend the rest of your days sitting on the couch watching TV and you proved you are stronger than that!\n\nAnyway, your kid's 15.  You know the terrible twos?  They got nothing on the teenage years.  Teens can be horrible little assholes at times, as you're finding out.  It's a lack of tact and no filter AND a 'look how cool I am' attitude that makes them say things they don't really mean.  Like making fun of authority figures: teachers... and parents.\n\nThat kid loves you, don't let the stupid thing he said ruin your relationship.", "I\u2019m struggling to vote on this one. I am also an adult with a disability and yeah, hearing others say things that validate our own fears (being a burden, useless, etc) hurts like hell. You\u2019ve also gone out of your way to find activities to share with your son.\n\nHe is being a little AH, trying to connect with his friends, who may think hiking is uncool or parents are uncool or whatever is going on in their hormone-flooded, underdeveloped brains. \n\nBut he also seems aware that what he was saying was inappropriate and hurtful. He apologized and tried to communicate about it.\n\nI\u2019d sit down and talk with him again when you\u2019ve had some time to process. Let it be an open dialogue. Ask him if he wants to talk about your disability and understand why these kind of comments are detrimental to not only you but disabled people as a whole. \n\nYou are not wrong in feeling hurt but this is an excellent learning opportunity for him to be better. This may not be easy for you but you are the parent and the adult. You have a chance to teach your son kindness, empathy, and understanding. \n\nNAH, if you can use this as a chance for communication and connection. Good luck!", "NTA\u2026.\n\nMaybe cut him some slack, though. 15 is the most horrible age.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry, I would be so heartbroken if my son did this. I do think he was probably trying to sound cool to his friends. Young boys strangely think the dumbest things would make them sound cool. \n\nI think it was the right thing to let him know how bad he hurt you. Calling names wasn\u2019t okay but you can use it as an opportunity to sit your son down, and show him how to apologize when someone\u2019s emotions get to high and say things out of line. You can calmly explain how it hurt you and ask him if he really doesn\u2019t want to go because of you or if he just wants to be with his friends. To teenagers they start making their whole world about their friends and can get really self centered. As a parent it is hard to balance encouraging them to build an identity separate from their family and still include family time.\n\nI am still healing from a terrible leg injury and I think I knew early on that it won\u2019t get all the way better but I just go along with the narrative it will so I don\u2019t get depressed and give up. What really hurts me is when people tell me about someone who broke their leg or had a knee replacement is doing so well and compare the two injuries like they are the same thing. To me it is so embarrassing to explain how bad my injury was, like I am making up excuses or something or whining. I\u2019m glad to hear you have been able to start hiking, way to go!", "Going against the grain a bit and I know I\u2019m about to get attacked in comments, but YTA. Being hurt by your son\u2019s words is absolutely valid. Your reaction was not. Kid at his age say stuff like that in front of their friends. You\u2019re the adult in this situation. You could have told you were hurt by his words and then taken some time to calm down instead of escalating the situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
