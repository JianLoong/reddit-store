{"id": 7176, "submission_id": "10a42pf", "title": "AITA for cutting my hair for my friend\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "This will require a little bit of backstory. So, when my group of friends (Sadie, Jenna, Niki, and me) were entering high school, we weren\u2019t very popular. Maybe a month or so before the school year started we were all hanging out and came to the conclusion that we didn\u2019t want to live like that for another 4 years, so we made a pact to all work on a few things, mainly try to get good at sports, talk to more people, and make ourselves look better.\n\nOne of the main things that made the 4 of us \u2018ugly\u2019 if you wanna call it that is that we all had short hair. So part of this pact was that we\u2019d all grow it. And we did. Through high school, that remained the main symbol of what we were doing and why, so we all valued it a ton.\n\nJune 9th, 2015 is when we all signed the contract. We\u2019d grown really close during high school, progressing to being probably the most popular girls at our school, and we didn\u2019t have any plans to lose contact. 4 years before then, we made a promise to each other to grow our hair for what was, at the time, a shallow reason, to get male attention.\n\nThe contract stated that when this journey was finally over, we\u2019d all cut our hair to how it was before the contract to symbolize the new beginning. And the end of the journey was when the last of us got married.\n\nSo that leads to my question. Sadie got married in 2017, Jenna in 2018, me in 2020 to a man named Dylan, and Niki got married yesterday. After the ceremony, and dinner, and all that, Jenna, Sadie, Niki, and I followed through with the contract and we all went to the salon to get our hair chopped off.\n\nSo the contract said it would be cut to the length it was before we made that pact in the summer before high school, so for me that was a really short version of a pixie cut. All our husbands were there, Niki\u2019s, Jenna\u2019s, and Sadie\u2019s were all supportive, but Dylan remained pretty silent throughout and during the car ride home.\n\nWhen we finally got in the house, he asked me what the fuck I was thinking, and said something along the lines of \u201cyour hair is your best trait, and you know that. I thought when you said you were cutting it, you meant a few inches, a foot at most. This is ugly.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t regret doing it, I\u2019ve known Sadie, Jenna, and Niki for years longer than Dylan, but I do know that he really liked to play with my hair, run his hands through it, brush it, stuff like that.\n\nI think maybe I should have been a little clearer about what exactly the contract said, I mean I was gonna do it anyways but I don\u2019t think that showed Dylan the respect and input he deserves as half of my relationship, so I could have done that better. IDK tho, AITA?\n\nEdit: as a comment I saw reminded me, since I posted this he did apologize for what he said and he told me it was mainly him being upset because he really likes it when he can help me brush or wash it and I won't need him to do that for a while. He said he'll miss that and he hopes I take that into account, but it's my choice at the end of the day", "created_utc": 1673541635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a42pf/aita_for_cutting_my_hair_for_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have grown to like the way I look with a beard  but it's still itchy and annoying, but I keep it because I love her and want to make her happy.\n\nHowever, when I clean shave once in a blue moon, she doesn't curse at me and say I'm ugly. She might ask me why, which I usually answer with \"It was too itchy, so I'm starting fresh\" and we move on from it. She acknowledges that it's my face and I can do what I want with it, but I want to be attractive to her, so I keep it most of the time.\n\nYour husband's response was harsh and uncalled for, which speaks volumes to his character.

You should apologize. \n\nThis will be downvoted to hell, but if you only are looking for validation from the barking seals that agree with you, your marriage is in trouble.", "NTA.\n\nHair grows.

While yes, spouses are totally allowed to make comments about a partner's appearance, it's more of an optional thing. No one has the *right* to do so-it's a privilege. Especially if you can't do so in a kind and respectful manner, like Dylan. Anyone, at any point, can say, \"I don't really like when you make comments on my body, so please stop,\" and that's allowed, whether they're in a relationship or not. You start getting into the mindset of \"I deserve the right to make comments on *your* body\" and you start getting into a whole host of issues. \n\nI see how you said you consider your wife's opinion in things you choose to do, and I think that's commendable-to a point. But I hope you remember that bodily autonomy is very much a precious thing, and there's a very fine line between thinking, \"I personally am okay with giving my partner input in my choices regarding appearance\" and \"*everyone* should be okay with that.\" It's totally fine for you to want your wife to have some decision in what you do with your body, but it's not okay to insist that *every* couple feel the same way. That's pretty much the opposite of consent and bodily autonomy, which every person has the right to.", "You're right, and that's why the divorce rate is so high. People don't seem to consider marriage a union anymore, where two lives become one. Instead, they want to maintain complete and total individualities, and that's why marriages fail.

I'm just saying you should at a minimum consider their valid opinions. And yes, it goes both ways, and Dylan's opinion was cruel. He could voice his opinion in a healthier, more respectful way, such as \"I found your previous style to be better looking\" or \"I am not fond of short styles\", while at the same time respecting her decision to style it that way.\n\nWhat also irks me is how people are attacking me for \"defending Dylan's behavior\" and \"wanting control over a woman's body\". Get bent, that's not what I'm doing here, and attacking me for such makes it pretty clear nobody is reading what I'm typing. So I'm done here.
