Now siblings fianc\u00e9 seems more focused on planning their wedding and said they want to get married before us. I couldn\u2019t care less, but agree as we have a big family it would make sense for our weddings to be a little bit apart. Sibling is now making me promise they can get married first. Thing is we have the funds ready, I want to start planning and I\u2019ve found a venue that is amazing but is stopping weddings in 2025 so if I chose it I would 100% get married before them, even if I don\u2019t pick that venue I do like the idea of getting married next year as I\u2019ve never wanted a long engagement.

Don't promisse that to your sibling. But tell them, you want to get married next year. If they want, the can choose their date first and you will pick one a few months later.

Pick your date and they can either start actively planning their wedding so it's before yours or they will have to do it after yours.

You can't plan your big life events around their feelings.", "Listen - this sort of person never gives this anger up.\n\nMy aunt was one of those.  She resented her younger sister for marrying before her.  She resented both her younger sister and my father for having kids when she didn't.  She ended up dying alone and unloved, because she pushed all her family away with her resentment.\n\nThis has absolutely nothing to do with you and everything to do with whatever's wired funny in their head.", "NTA - Set a date. they can always set one before you. If not... well thats on them.", "NTA. Why should you wait around in limbo for your sister to get around to it. Get married when you and fiance want to and tell you sister to get over herself.", "NTA.\n\nIf they are dragging their ass on getting married, that isn't your problem.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Sibling is now making me promise they can get married first. \" .. Don't make that promisse - tell her: If she wants to get married befpre you, she better hurries.
