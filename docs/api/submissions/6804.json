Yes it's difficult and uncomfortable, but if she spends her life getting other people to speak for her, then she will never improve. At some point she needs to take responsibility for herself and her personal growth. \n\nBeing understanding of someone with anxiety and social anxiety would look more like saying \"I'll come with you to the pharmacy, and I'll be by your side while you ask for what you need.\" As that way you're providing support without being a crutch to hide behind.

She needs to understand that there won't always be someone there who willing to hold her hand and do things for her.

You can\u2019t rely on the idea that someone will always be there to do it for you (and this is coming from someone with social anxiety). \n\nYour sister is not the asshole for having social anxiety and wanting help.

So she should probably consider therapy for that. \n\nAs for the plan B itself, I hope she got it in the end. If she\u2019s having sex she needs to be aware of the risks.
