She needs to understand that there won't always be someone there who willing to hold her hand and do things for her.

Big sis simply describes her being too anxious to go get Plan B herself and asked for help. Maybe she had fully consensual sex. But we don\u2019t know that. Let\u2019s just say that most of the unprotected situations my friends and I encountered between 16-22 included people telling us we didn\u2019t need to use a condom because X Y or Z and feeling pressured into continuing. Not saying that\u2019s what happened, but we have just as much proof of consent as we have proof of coercion. \n\nPregnancy and children aren\u2019t a FAAFO situation. Thinking they are is why we have so much childhood poverty. Donate to your local abortion funds.\n\nI hope sincerely all of the N T A folks never need to have a plan B or C.\n\nMods: I\u2019m not a bot and I didn\u2019t steal!

Can\u2019t they refuse to serve you in some US states even?\nMaybe this one instance of someone with chronic social anxiety not wanting to go in person and request a medication that is ridiculously stigmatized and surrounded by politics and misinformation shouldn\u2019t reflect badly on her because it\u2019s completely understandable. (E.g. every comment here about how she\u2019s too immature or irresponsible to be having sex.)", "Plan B is not a contraceptive. It's an emergency measure. You have no idea which contraception method they used - and let them down.\n\nIt's fucking terrifying to have a condom break and to have no idea what to do, don't make it more difficult than it should be.", "I thought it prevented implantation of a fertilized egg?\n\nEdit: looked it up. It does both! Cool.", "So, you are also insinuating the OP intentionally kept a rape out of the conversation?  Then you\u2019d also be insinuating that the sister did not seek any sort of medical treatment for a violent attack; therefore, not receiving Plan B from the facility. Stop making up your own stories in your own mind. The girl had sex and was too embarrassed to purchase a Plan B. Simple as that.", "I\u2019m glad you brought up the consultation room aspect of the purchase. I live in Australia, and while I haven\u2019t personally taken plan b before, my friend has. She told me that it was quite a lengthy process where she had to go through quite a bit of history with the pharmacist on duty before being allowed to purchase it. I can\u2019t remember if she had to take it then and there though. This was several years ago so I\u2019m not sure if the rules have since changed. But yeah it feels strange for something so significant to be given to anyone who asks for it without any further details when it needs to consider so many other personal/medical factors.", "I have plenty of empathy. I just think children need to learn to self advocate so they aren't relying on people to do things for them.", "If OP\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t take care of it herself now, every time she needs to do this will be \u201cthe first time.\u201d She might as well get it over with now, it\u2019s not going to get any easier by continuing to not do it herself and pawn it off on someone else.", "What about next time?", "And you drew this interpretation how? Where does she say that?", "I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m having a difficult time finding OP\u2019s comment that her sister was pressured to have sex with an older boy. Can you link that comment?  \n\nOtherwise, STFU and stop making crap up.", "Projection", "You really came on here and reinvented the narrative for what reason?", "You made that up", "This is very close to how I got made, alas. (Not pressured into the sex, but pressured into the skipping the condom.)\n\nWhile there's no way to know exactly what happened, it's not like that's an uncommon experience either.", "Why you making up the story now?", "It seems like a bit much to put on someone else. I'm also wondering, if the baby was born, would the sister be responsible for doctors visits? Finding daycare, etc, etc. At what point is social anxiety not your own problem? I have insane social anxiety too, but its nobody's responsibility but my own to clean up my messes. Doesnt seem like she was too socially awkward to find a partner...", ">how will she handle it if it happens again?\n\nHopefully the sister is in therapy working on this (if not, she should be). Punishing someone for having social anxiety with the refrain \"how are you gonna learn\" is ignorant and dismissive. Getting over social anxiety can be a very long and torturous process. It's not a one-and-done thing. \n\nOP knows her sister has the problem, and presumably cares about her sister. OP also said nothing about going in to pick it up being a potentially negative experience for her, so the entirety of her refusal is punishing her sister for her mental illness. \n\nCould sister have gone in and gotten it? Yes, but it would be at great emotional expense (and likely making the social anxiety even worse). Every negative experience you have compounds the fear.\n\nNobody has the right to say this \"should\" be a teaching moment for the sister. Her therapy is between her and her therapist. Did the OP have the right to refuse? Of course. Was it a kind thing to refuse something that would have caused no harm to OP, and great harm to sister? Nope, and for that reason I'm giving the YTA.\n\nMental illness is illness. Leave treatment decisions to the person with the illness and their health care team. Just because you don't have the illness, don't have it to the same degree, or don't understand it, doesn't make it okay to bash the person who has it. They didn't choose to be ill.", "Generally phobias are treated with exposure therapy. The thing with that is that it's in a controlled environment at first, and little by little. If she goes to get the plan b and has a full blown panic attack, next time she needs to do something similar, she'll be even more anxious.", "I'm sorry you've been that unwell, and I'm glad you've got treatment. It really is a dark and hopeless place. Especially if it's combined with depression.", "Fair enough", "Yep. Had a friend take it and got all the nasty side ecfects like vomiting, bleeding, cramping, etc. It was bad enough that she said next time she'd just get pregnant.", "Also a difference in how people view buying condoms (you are being responsible!) and view buying Plan B (how irresponsible, you fucked up).", "We\u2019re not talking about next time, are we?\n\nIf the sister is really so put out by doing this it\u2019s easy enough to say \u201cI won\u2019t help you again.\u201d", "You don\u2019t know that this isn\u2019t the case either.", "Just like you made up a scenario in which a socially awkward person suddenly gained the confidence to enter into a completely balanced adult sexual relationship?", "I\u2019m not bashing anyone. But the reality of this situation is shit like this *isn\u2019t going away.* Sis isn\u2019t always going to have someone there to hold her hand through these things, that\u2019s just a fact. At some point *she does need to learn to do these things herself.* What if she\u2019s on vacation out of town when she needs it again? In the end she found a way to get it herself so she apparently could do it. Pushing things off and delaying them doesn\u2019t make them go away and will just keep making it worse.", "Or \"I'll do it this time, but let's work on that and practice some scripts so that if it happens again, you will feel more confident to do it yourself.\"", "I can dismiss it with as much evidence as you brought it with\u2026 none"]}
