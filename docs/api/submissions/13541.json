All you did was tell her you definitely thought she was out of shape, which is just going to make her feel worse.", "Let's try this. You just got fired because your boss found a series of big mistakes on your part. You realize you're over leveraged financially, you just had a baby, and you're not even going to be able to make the house payment. No one will hire you in the local area, because your industry is close-knit, and you're not even getting interview requests after sending out hundreds of resumes.\n\nYou're having a particularly bad day, after your car is repossessed for non payment, and your wife says \"Babe, I will always love you, no matter what a failure as a man you are\".

Period. Full stop. Just don't.\n\nThen, \"What I meant is that you are the most beautiful person in the world to me, inside and out, and there's nothing that will ever change that.\"  If you'd like access to her body again, you might want to compliment her new dangerous curves and let her know you mean it by leering SLIGHTLY with the elevator-eyes as you say it.\n\nIf she accepts than, STFU about weight forevermore.  Your only answer should be, if (and only if) she asks, \"If you ask me, it's in all the right places.\"", "YTA.  Not for the sentiment but for the painfully poor choice of words.

Your wife is feeling immensely insecure about her new shape and size. She has extra padding everywhere and likely regardless of how much she diets and exercises it won't leave (unless she develops a ED which sadly is highly likely right now due to her mental health) and she SEES IT DAILY. When she tries her favorite jeans on and they don't button or zip or that amazing top she loves won't stay put and rolls up..or even the bracelet or ring she adores no longer fits. She sees it.\n\nWhat she doesn't need is pointing out that she's heavier. Which is what you did. Women know that theirs a high chance when a person calls them \"big\" it means fat.\n\nYou just told your post partum wife that she is fat in your eyes. Aka you dun fucked up son. You used the WORST wording possible. It should've been as simple as \n\n\"I love you for who you are. And for everything you've given me. You've given me four beautiful children and is the most beautiful woman in the world\"\n\nYou DO NOT MENTION SIZE. Dear goddess man! Have you learned nothing?? Weight, size, and things of that nature is likely a trap and you avoid it. And I say this a a biologically born woman! Weight and things like \"do I look fat, does this dress make me look fat\" etc ARE TRAP QUESTIONS. You avoid them or try to change the subject. You don't feed into them.\n\nDude. Just no. Apologize and swear and actually do better....", "Postpartum depression is a real thing. I would advise you to help her and encourage her to do things to help her improve her image. Get a family gym membership and go with her. Help her with preparing healthy meals. Get her a spa day or two. Mani/ pedi. Maybe even a romantic getaway for the 2 of you. Woow her like when you were first courting her", "YTA.\n\nI get you're trying to support her and you're coming from a place of love but the way you worded the sentence seemed like an insult.

There's no getting around that. You would have been smart to stop at \"I'll always love you no matter what\" and say no more. Your heart may be in the right place, but you have to realize that there are things better left unspoken. You did not need to be literal here. The sentiment would have been understood without it.\n\nAs I write this out, I've decided to say YTA for actually saying the words \"no matter how big you get.\" This was a situation where less words were needed, and by saying what you did, you called attention to exactly what she has been feeling depressed and insecure about. That's the AH part. But I do think you are genuinely trying and just screwed up instead of being deliberately malicious. Do better with your choice of words in the future, and for now, don't push this incident anymore. Keep your head down and just keep doing nice things for her so she can resolve how she feels at her own pace.", "NTA. I think you meant well but didn\u2019t word it properly.

All she heard with that sentence was you confirming that she\u2019s fat. YTA.", "YTA you know she's feeling insecure and you called her big? Oh lord. No no no no no. You say \"omg you are so sexy, you just get more beautiful\" then kiss her. \nYou never call her big, fat, old, ugly, or anything negative. \nHow did you survive this long and not know this? You called your wife fat! No wonder she's upset.", "NTA but very poor choice of words. You should have just simply said that you loved her just the way she is.", "NTA. You have good intentions, but it\u2019s also clearly a sensitive topic for her and you probably could\u2019ve handled it better. \n\nWomen are constantly pressured to meet a set of social \u201cbeauty\u201d standards and experience real social consequences for *not* meeting those expectations. Women can experience anything from passive aggressive comments to outright harassment and abuse. This message something ingrained in women from literal childhood. \n\nYour wife is struggling seeing her body change in ways that don\u2019t conform to these beauty expectations. She\u2019s probably really stressed and emotional about it, and if she recently gave birth her hormones will likely be going crazy which will mean she cries more easily, feels emotion more intensely, etc. \n\nThe reason she got upset is because what she heard from you was \u201cyou\u2019re getting fat/gaining weight, and I noticed\u201d not \u201cI love you.\u201d This isn\u2019t necessarily your fault, it comes from social messaging around beauty that is constantly targeting women and puts them on the defensive.\n\nI\u2019d suggest approaching her when you both have time (not busy/rushing/stressed). Start by apologizing, then explain you realize you messed up with what you said and really just noticed her stress and wanted to lessen it by letting her know you love her no matter what. Avoid making any comments that could be even possibly considered negative. Tell her you love her and her body, and always will, and some things you like about her physically. Tell her you want to support her in any way you can. She may or may not want to talk to about this, and you should respect that either way.\n\nTherapy might be really helpful for her, but don\u2019t try suggesting it immediately. If you do bring it up eventually, make it about literally anything but her physical body. Make it about stress, etc. Maybe consider going to therapy yourself (it never hurts!) and suggest you both do it (individually) to take care of your mental health.\n\nApologize. Be genuine. Be empathetic. Be patient.", "YTA but I get it. There was a girl I liked who was insecure about her weight and I kept insisting that not only was not fat at all (she wasn\u2019t) but even if she were fat she would still be gorgeous (true). I thought that kind of thing would be encouraging but it wasn\u2019t. She thought she was fat, nothing could change that. \n\n\nFor your wife, you confirmed her own insecurities. But also taking her out to dinner and stuff, while full of good intentions, contributes to perpetuating the problem that\u2019s getting her down in the first place. \n\nMaybe try being supportive of her goals rather than trying to mitigate her current concerns?

There isn't going to be some magic phrase you can say that will penetrative through the self loathing and decades of conditioning about a womans worth being tied to looking a particular way. That being said, focus your compliments away from specifically her body, which sounds weird I know, but towards effect. When I feel the worst about my appearance the compliments from my partner that make me feel the best are impact. If my fiance sees me he looks a little dumb strick and says \"wow... how gorgeous you are catches me off guard everytime.\" I know he's playing it up a bit because he's making me feel better, but it works because I also know it's also true. That's what you should be aiming to make her feel, rather than trying to counter specific insecurities, because pointing them out, even positively, brings more attention to her already negative feelings.", "YTA\nYou told her you will love her no matter how big she is. So you told her you think she's big. After all of her efforts to return to a size she's happy with, you told her she's big. There's no way you did know what you said wring here. You probably haven't been as supportive as you are making out in this post if you think telling your wife she's big is a good idea. Get your head out of your backside.

As a woman who's been there (mom of 4, pregnant with #5) she needs not only your unconditional support, but some mental health care from a therapist or doctor. \nAlso, backpedal. Go to her and explain that you were not trying to call her fat/big/anything of the sort. Apologize for hurting her feelings, and hopefully she will recognize that wasn't your intention.  Explain to her that you love her for who she is, not ONLY for her appearance and you were not trying to comment on her size, you just poorly stated that you love her unconditionally. Then, as long as you REALLY do still find her attractive (no one wants to be lied to) explain to her that you ARE still physically attracted to her, and then BE SPECIFIC about what you find attractive.

It takes just 5 seconds to tell \u201cyour stomach is so beautiful, I want to kiss it every time I see\u201d, you don\u2019t need an occasion to tell, just have an eye contact. Hearing something like this every day would boost her confidence. But be ready, that at start it would get some negative words from her about how she don\u2019t believe, but its just insecurities. Hearing body compliments everyday have great effect, but it needs time. One more thing, go for sexy compliments, a wife want to be desired by her partner, and do it more.

When someone is in distress over their body image, that sounds like \u201cyes you\u2019re fat, but I still love you\u201d. She didn\u2019t want to hear that and that is what everyone around you is telling you. You\u2019re still not being receptive to it and you\u2019re going to cause more hurt and harm in the future because you\u2019re being so obtuse.", "YTA. Dude, seriously we need to explain this to you? Come on", "You lied to us, you misled us. You said one thing in your title, and then you said another thing in the post. I was going to say NTA just based on their title. And obviously everyone's going to tell you what you said wrong with what you said in the post.\n\nYTA", "YTA, not for the sentiment but for the execution. You are clearly worried about her mental health but your wording made it all physical.\n\nYou need to backtrack immediately but unfortunately I don\u2019t think she will forget this", "Slight YTA. You worded it wrong. I got what you wanted to say, but your wife interpreted your words as calling her fat.", "YTA.  You don't just tell somebody \"you're fat but I still love you\" and expect them to take it well.", "That was not nicely handled IMO.\n\nId say something more like: i know youve feeling down, i can tell. I just want you to know i appreciate all your sacrifices and i wish i could be the one to carry the burden instead of you. It is amazing how your body could create a human. And i will always treasure you for it. You are amazing and i love you and your body just the way you are. And i always will.", "'I \u2764\ufe0f Love You!' is a complete sentence!!! Say it.

Then I reread what he actually said\u2026 yikes.", "Better thing to say would have been \"I know you're feeling insecure lately but I want you to know I love you and you're incredibly beautiful\".\n\nOP YTA, as well intentioned as you are.", "Oh yeah this guys sex life just died.

I made a huge mistake, and I promise to be more sensitive to how my words might land before I say them. You can count on me to be responsible in my communication with you and I want you to let me know when I\u2019m not being that way. I love you and I want our relationship to be something that supports you, not something that makes difficulties you\u2019re facing harder.\u201d\n\nOP YTA. No woman anywhere that is feeling frumpy after giving birth wants to hear the words \u201cbigger\u201d, \u201cheavier\u201d, \u201clooser\u201d, etc. Try being sensitive to how she\u2019s feeling and what might be triggering her feelings. \n\nAlso watch for postpartum depression and encourage your wife to talk to her doctor about it. It\u2019s something that many women experience after childbirth.", "Tip number 8. Wear two condoms. She doesn't want to get preggers again. And that's if u ever get any again.\n\nDon't mention her size ever the hell again, don't say it, don't think it, don't imply. Just say you will love her always.

It might make her feel under pressure and like the husband only cares about getting her to put out.", "I can't understand how you think those are 2 different things. They are the same thing. You just rearranged the words slightly. YTA", "Every time we see or hear something we filter it through the lens of our own perspective. Our perspective is influenced by a number of things. That\u2019s why there\u2019s sometimes a huge disconnect between what a person actually says, and what the person they said it to thinks they have heard.\n\nYour wife has the perspective that she is fat. Now, whether you meant to or not you reinforced that perspective with your choice of words. You stated that you would love her no matter how big she gets, which implies that she has gotten bigger and that you have noticed. She has then filtered that through her own perceptions about herself, and so what she has heard is that you agree with her that she is fat.\n\nIt may not be what you said, but it is what she has heard. YTA for choosing to use a phrase with that implication, and for mentioning her body in the first place. You have tied your feelings about her to how she looks. That is something she is not likely to forget.", "You said \"no matter how big YOU ARE\" \n\nYOU. ARE.\n\nAs in present-tense. As in \"you ARE big\"\n\nIf you wanted to say you don't consider her fat but would love her even if she was, you should have said \"I'd love you *even if you were fat.* But you aren't.\"", "I love you and you're the sexiest woman on earth\n\nYou don't need to qualify it", "The person that you are responding to said NOT to apologize with \u201cyou mistook my comment\u201d.", "They said \u201cDont day \u201cmistook\u201d.", "I agree. The last thing a woman who feels bad about her body wants is to put it on display in lingerie that will probably fit wrong.", "He probably was half asleep when he said it and so brain wasn't working properly.

I'm 2 years postpartum, about five pounds up from my pre-preg weight, and somehow that translates to \\~5 pants sizes. Plus needing a completely different style of pant - I didn't realize how lucky I was that most cuts of pants looked fine on me. Now I have to very strategically buy pants that camouflage the C-section shelf without digging uncomfortably into my belly.\n\nBasically cosigning allllllll of this.
