All you did was tell her you definitely thought she was out of shape, which is just going to make her feel worse.", "Let's try this. You just got fired because your boss found a series of big mistakes on your part. You realize you're over leveraged financially, you just had a baby, and you're not even going to be able to make the house payment. No one will hire you in the local area, because your industry is close-knit, and you're not even getting interview requests after sending out hundreds of resumes.\n\nYou're having a particularly bad day, after your car is repossessed for non payment, and your wife says \"Babe, I will always love you, no matter what a failure as a man you are\".

Period. Full stop. Just don't.\n\nThen, \"What I meant is that you are the most beautiful person in the world to me, inside and out, and there's nothing that will ever change that.\"  If you'd like access to her body again, you might want to compliment her new dangerous curves and let her know you mean it by leering SLIGHTLY with the elevator-eyes as you say it.\n\nIf she accepts than, STFU about weight forevermore.  Your only answer should be, if (and only if) she asks, \"If you ask me, it's in all the right places.\"", "YTA.  Not for the sentiment but for the painfully poor choice of words.

Your wife is feeling immensely insecure about her new shape and size. She has extra padding everywhere and likely regardless of how much she diets and exercises it won't leave (unless she develops a ED which sadly is highly likely right now due to her mental health) and she SEES IT DAILY. When she tries her favorite jeans on and they don't button or zip or that amazing top she loves won't stay put and rolls up..or even the bracelet or ring she adores no longer fits. She sees it.\n\nWhat she doesn't need is pointing out that she's heavier. Which is what you did. Women know that theirs a high chance when a person calls them \"big\" it means fat.\n\nYou just told your post partum wife that she is fat in your eyes. Aka you dun fucked up son. You used the WORST wording possible. It should've been as simple as \n\n\"I love you for who you are. And for everything you've given me. You've given me four beautiful children and is the most beautiful woman in the world\"\n\nYou DO NOT MENTION SIZE. Dear goddess man! Have you learned nothing?? Weight, size, and things of that nature is likely a trap and you avoid it. And I say this a a biologically born woman! Weight and things like \"do I look fat, does this dress make me look fat\" etc ARE TRAP QUESTIONS. You avoid them or try to change the subject. You don't feed into them.\n\nDude. Just no. Apologize and swear and actually do better....", "Postpartum depression is a real thing. I would advise you to help her and encourage her to do things to help her improve her image. Get a family gym membership and go with her. Help her with preparing healthy meals. Get her a spa day or two. Mani/ pedi. Maybe even a romantic getaway for the 2 of you. Woow her like when you were first courting her", "YTA.\n\nI get you're trying to support her and you're coming from a place of love but the way you worded the sentence seemed like an insult.

There's no getting around that. You would have been smart to stop at \"I'll always love you no matter what\" and say no more. Your heart may be in the right place, but you have to realize that there are things better left unspoken. You did not need to be literal here. The sentiment would have been understood without it.\n\nAs I write this out, I've decided to say YTA for actually saying the words \"no matter how big you get.\" This was a situation where less words were needed, and by saying what you did, you called attention to exactly what she has been feeling depressed and insecure about. That's the AH part. But I do think you are genuinely trying and just screwed up instead of being deliberately malicious. Do better with your choice of words in the future, and for now, don't push this incident anymore. Keep your head down and just keep doing nice things for her so she can resolve how she feels at her own pace.", "NTA. I think you meant well but didn\u2019t word it properly.

All she heard with that sentence was you confirming that she\u2019s fat. YTA.", "YTA you know she's feeling insecure and you called her big? Oh lord. No no no no no. You say \"omg you are so sexy, you just get more beautiful\" then kiss her. \nYou never call her big, fat, old, ugly, or anything negative. \nHow did you survive this long and not know this? You called your wife fat! No wonder she's upset.", "NTA but very poor choice of words. You should have just simply said that you loved her just the way she is.", "NTA. You have good intentions, but it\u2019s also clearly a sensitive topic for her and you probably could\u2019ve handled it better. \n\nWomen are constantly pressured to meet a set of social \u201cbeauty\u201d standards and experience real social consequences for *not* meeting those expectations. Women can experience anything from passive aggressive comments to outright harassment and abuse. This message something ingrained in women from literal childhood. \n\nYour wife is struggling seeing her body change in ways that don\u2019t conform to these beauty expectations. She\u2019s probably really stressed and emotional about it, and if she recently gave birth her hormones will likely be going crazy which will mean she cries more easily, feels emotion more intensely, etc. \n\nThe reason she got upset is because what she heard from you was \u201cyou\u2019re getting fat/gaining weight, and I noticed\u201d not \u201cI love you.\u201d This isn\u2019t necessarily your fault, it comes from social messaging around beauty that is constantly targeting women and puts them on the defensive.\n\nI\u2019d suggest approaching her when you both have time (not busy/rushing/stressed). Start by apologizing, then explain you realize you messed up with what you said and really just noticed her stress and wanted to lessen it by letting her know you love her no matter what. Avoid making any comments that could be even possibly considered negative. Tell her you love her and her body, and always will, and some things you like about her physically. Tell her you want to support her in any way you can. She may or may not want to talk to about this, and you should respect that either way.\n\nTherapy might be really helpful for her, but don\u2019t try suggesting it immediately. If you do bring it up eventually, make it about literally anything but her physical body. Make it about stress, etc. Maybe consider going to therapy yourself (it never hurts!) and suggest you both do it (individually) to take care of your mental health.\n\nApologize. Be genuine. Be empathetic. Be patient.", "YTA but I get it. There was a girl I liked who was insecure about her weight and I kept insisting that not only was not fat at all (she wasn\u2019t) but even if she were fat she would still be gorgeous (true). I thought that kind of thing would be encouraging but it wasn\u2019t. She thought she was fat, nothing could change that. \n\n\nFor your wife, you confirmed her own insecurities. But also taking her out to dinner and stuff, while full of good intentions, contributes to perpetuating the problem that\u2019s getting her down in the first place. \n\nMaybe try being supportive of her goals rather than trying to mitigate her current concerns?

There isn't going to be some magic phrase you can say that will penetrative through the self loathing and decades of conditioning about a womans worth being tied to looking a particular way. That being said, focus your compliments away from specifically her body, which sounds weird I know, but towards effect. When I feel the worst about my appearance the compliments from my partner that make me feel the best are impact. If my fiance sees me he looks a little dumb strick and says \"wow... how gorgeous you are catches me off guard everytime.\" I know he's playing it up a bit because he's making me feel better, but it works because I also know it's also true. That's what you should be aiming to make her feel, rather than trying to counter specific insecurities, because pointing them out, even positively, brings more attention to her already negative feelings.", "YTA\nYou told her you will love her no matter how big she is. So you told her you think she's big. After all of her efforts to return to a size she's happy with, you told her she's big. There's no way you did know what you said wring here. You probably haven't been as supportive as you are making out in this post if you think telling your wife she's big is a good idea. Get your head out of your backside.

As a woman who's been there (mom of 4, pregnant with #5) she needs not only your unconditional support, but some mental health care from a therapist or doctor. \nAlso, backpedal. Go to her and explain that you were not trying to call her fat/big/anything of the sort. Apologize for hurting her feelings, and hopefully she will recognize that wasn't your intention.  Explain to her that you love her for who she is, not ONLY for her appearance and you were not trying to comment on her size, you just poorly stated that you love her unconditionally. Then, as long as you REALLY do still find her attractive (no one wants to be lied to) explain to her that you ARE still physically attracted to her, and then BE SPECIFIC about what you find attractive.

I know that my husband loves me and finds me attractive. I don't need him to tell me he loves me when I'm fat because I already know that. For me, and I think many other women, it's much more about not recognizing yourself in your new body. My previously perky breasts are now in constant contact with my rib cage. I have large stretch marks from my upper thighs up past my belly button. My feet are a size and a half larger than they were before motherhood. No matter how much weight I lose, all of that will still be true. And the feeling of being unrecognizable in my own body is magnified by how much my life has changed.

A lot more of it was about internal shifts, both physical and metaphorical.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it would have seemed like I was really stressed about weight gain.

My husband sometimes struggles with communication, but somehow with weight problems, he helped me a lot by busting my confidence, when I was on my lowest.

Its all about adjectives :) \r  \nOne more suggestion, listen carefully to what she says about her body, and start complimenting things, that she is most insecure about. It takes just 5 seconds to tell \u201cyour stomach is so beautiful, I want to kiss it every time I see\u201d, you don\u2019t need an occasion to tell, just have an eye contact. Hearing something like this every day would boost her confidence. But be ready, that at start it would get some negative words from her about how she don\u2019t believe, but its just insecurities. Hearing body compliments everyday have great effect, but it needs time. One more thing, go for sexy compliments, a wife want to be desired by her partner, and do it more. Its OK to tell her how she is amazing 2-10 a day.
