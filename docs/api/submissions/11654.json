Because what you've actually described is wanting an occasional babysitter, not abdicating all responsibility. You're allowed to decline babysitting or requests for food. But I don't see where you've described them doing anything other than asking for help if you're available or if the grandparents are available.", "NTA you don't have to be part of your sister village if you don't choose to and you are setting expectations early so there is no confusion.\n\nBUT if you aren't willing to help out your sister with her life in ANY way should she have kids don't expect any support from her in return.  Get your appendix out and need help around the house \"she's not part of your village\".  Run into hard financial times and need a loan, \"she's not part of your village\".  Get a pet and need some one to check in on them while you are away, \"she's not part of your village\".  You need emotional support because your partner cheats on you, \"she is not part of your village\".  \n\nThere is a big difference between saying you aren't interested in baby sitting and saying you will cut off all support of your sister should she choose to have kids.  If you want to maintain a good and reciprical relationship with your sister but do not want to take on child related responsibilities you could still be a little supportive in ways that fit your boundaries.  Dropping off a meal or two while she is physically recovering is a pretty easy thing to do, send a card to wish her well, if she gets sick offer to pick up a perscription from the pharmacy and drop it off to her rather than taking care of the kids so she can go.  We all need a village sometimes, not just those with kids.  \n\nNow if you don't value your sister at all and want to cut her out of your life don't use her future kids as your excuse.  Just be honest that you don't value her and go no contact, she will probably be better off without you.", "NTA\n\nThey don't have kids yet, and it takes a village, but it must be willing villagers, and they're not to take over the parents and raise the kids for them.

It is also normal for friends and family to bring by some meals (a week or so) after the family with newborn goes home from the hospital.\n\nIt is also acceptable and normal for said extended family to decline when asked to watch kids for a night.\n\nIt is NOT normal (at least in the US) to expect extended family to share the responsibilities and financial burden of parenting.\n\nI think there\u2019s some miscommunication among various family that\u2019s going on, too.", "Your post is littered with so much contempt and unnecessary rudeness that it's so very hard to give a proper judgement.

If you judge your sibling for asking your parents or you for help, then surely you don\u2019t ever expect to reach out to them, ever, for anything, correct?\n\nFamily helps family because they choose to, because supporting each other is a part of showing love.\n\nNot everyone can or wants to be close to their biological family. You are not wrong for choosing to create what sounds like a large amount of emotional distance and will likely result in limited contact. I genuinely give you props for being so clear about that from the start.

Otherwise, I hope your space is everything you wanted.", "This is one of those classic AITA tropes (so much so that it\u2019s probably trolling rage bait).  No, you\u2019re not an asshole for not babysitting or making someone food or whatever; they\u2019re not entitled to your help.  But if you tell someone a you supposedly care about, \u201chey, on principle I\u2019m going to refuse to help you at an important point in your life.

The \"It takes a village\" thing doesn't mean foisting off your parental responsibility. \n\nThe phrase comes from the exchange of wisdom and skills.

No one decides to have children or not based on their brother's ability or inclination to help. You could have let your actions speak louder than words by not engaging in their child rearing. They're not going to drop a litter of children at once, they can have one and discover you're not interested, have another and recognize again you're not making yourself available to help, have more and find you're still not available. \n\nI do think your snarking about being a food bank is asshole-ish because its normal to bring food to ailing or otherwise preoccupied people whether its due to child birth, a broken bone, or grieving a loss... its not outlandish that they'd hope for a meal train in the immediate aftermath of a medical event. You don't have to stay to hold the baby while a new mom naps or showers in the earliest days, but calling it food bank is unkind.

They've already guilted our parents and the in-laws into watching the kids once in a while when they have them, and seem to expect us to do so as well. My sister seems to think that once she has her kids, we'll be swinging by to drop off food and \"give her a break\" for a while.\n\nWell we decided to clear that up, and make it known now that we won't be helping to raise THEIR children for them. We aren't going to babysit, we aren't going to be a free food bank for them, and we are not going to let them foist their responsibilities onto us.\n\nMy sister was hurt, and snitched to our mother, who said I was being too harsh.

They didn't even pay the grandparents. \"You're at home all day, why can't you just watch your own niece/nephew?\" When they were WORKING. FROM HOME.

Sis and BIL have no respect for consent and are acting entitled to free labor and financial support to an immoral degree.", "Thank you so much! I am very lucky, I have a strong and loving village. Thank you for your kindness!", "If my Mom for example said to me: If we go to Florida, I am expecting you to XYZ, and ABC and even some 123 for us. \n\nAnd I said: No. I will not be doing that. I hope you have fun in Florida but please do not expect that of me. \n\nThere--I just set a boundary in a very clear, concise polite way for something that hasn't even occurred. \n\nIt's actually quite healthy to set boundaries. Nothing can be misconstrued this way.", "I perceived snark too. But justified snark. Sis is laying a trap lmao", "Can\u2019t tell you how often I hear this .. kid is in pain \u2026 must be psychiatric in nature because it\u2019s just not possible for kids to experience pain. Makes me furious. Glad you found better help.", "Hardly a happy ending. I'm so sorry to hear that. People never think about the realities that can happen when parenting because even when the really tough stuff happens, it remains largely out of sight. Kind thoughts to your family and wishes for continued healing to your daughter.", "Just wanted to say how sorry I am this happened to your family.", "They have already convinced their parents to hang out with their grandchildren sometimes. I shudder to think of what nefarious pressures they must have applied.", "I mean I of course don\u2019t know what really happened but the way it\u2019s written sounds very biased, so I\u2019m not sure if there was really any guilting in done by the sister and bil \n\nAlso \u201conce in a while\u201d doesn\u2019t sound like that much, for me that\u2019s more like once a month than once a week.\n\nBut either way I do think it\u2019s smart to talk to parents and in-laws about how much they will be available for babysitting way before the kid is born, because if they don\u2019t ever want to do that you know you\u2019ll have to find other solutions when you still have time", "The way its worded, this is slanted and seems to be just OPs take. The whole write-up seems pretty slanted. I'd be curious to hear the other side.", "Yeah, I'm curious if they really did guilt them or if it was a proactive conversation working out expectations/a potential schedule for childcare. Especially given the use of 'once in a while', it doesn't sound like they're foisting them off on grandparents from the get-go.", "So they asked both sets of grandparents if they wanted to spend some time with their grandkid?  Wow, how awful", "Babysitting the grandchildren once in a while is likely not guilted into. My mom adores having the kids around. Even now, they are teens, and she will get them during school lunch once a week to eat together.  They have a huge bound. And in return from the delicious meals, the occasional ride, the getting them from school when they are sick, they also help her around the house for big chores that she is now to tired to do, my husband helps with the electronics, I help with managing various accounts or I house sit for her\u2026. \n\nOP thinks that babysitting children that are not yours is de facto imposed and torture. \n\nSome people like being around their family members, even if they are still in diapers.", "Are you being sarcastic? I genuinely can't tell. \n\nOf course adults ask for help all the time. I would say I sign of maturity is knowing when to ask for help.", "Oh I\u2019m on board with mocking OP. I think sister is being responsible in asking parents, maybe I\u2019m crazy but I think grand parents like that. I know my parents do with nieces and my I love being a Uncle. My family has done allot and I like being able to help, never it feels like obligation. I babysit when it\u2019s cool, bro helps me mount TV or fix fence. Never do we keep track", "The family agreed to babysit, that\u2019s their choice. OP did not. OP\u2019s sister assumed OP would help since the rest of the family did, that\u2019s wrong. \n\n*\u2019And, while a parent may sign up for \u2018no breaks\u2019\u2026\u2019*\n\nThere\u2019s no \u2018may\u2019, they do sign up for no breaks when they have kids, that\u2019s one of the many \u2018perks\u2019 of having them. \n\nExpecting family to care for your kids or give you a break is wrong. Sister expected OP to do it since everyone else said they would, that\u2019s why OP made themselves clear. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the circumstances, family is not obligated to care for your kids.", "Thanks for clearing that up. I thought fump was some new word I hadn't cottoned on to, yet.", "Ok but not everyone wants to babysit tho. If she already has other help there\u2019s no need for the drama she\u2019s causing for a kid that doesn\u2019t exist. Ofc emergencies are an exception", "Really well said.", "U can\u2019t plan to have a kid if u going to relay heavily on others.", "The question is why is op brother and sil already asking their parents to babysit a child they are not even pregnant with?", "Who left Timmy alone at a bus stop if he\u2019s not wise enough to fend for himself? And giving the kid a ride in a very unlikely situation is very different than taking care of him regularly", "It may be called being family but op is in his right to not be a babysitter. He set this boundary now before his sister had a baby.\n\nBut from op it sounds like sister doesn\u2019t want an emergency back up babysitter. Instead she has made comments about helping when she needs a break. And sister expects them to drop by with food.\n\nShe has told them what she expects so op told her what he was willing to do. This doesn\u2019t make him a bad person. He is entitled to not want to babysit.\n\n\nHe sit boundaries now so she knows who the back up child care will be when she does have kids. She now knows op and his wife are not on the list to be called.", "No, he's setting boundaries.  NTA. Just because YOU want children doesn't mean I want to watch said children. Family or not.", "Judging her for planning to pawn the responsibility of her own children off on other people before they even exist, planning on getting financial help from others to help raise the child before they exist. If you want children and are planning to have them, then plan to raise them yourself, plan to provide for them yourself. People who plan to pawn off the responsibility of raising their own children on other people are the absolute worst", "For some reason, the line about guilting the future grandparents into watching them on occasion leads me to believe this isn\u2019t the most reliable of narrators. I am skeptical at least one of them isn\u2019t incredibly excited for grandkids and plans to jump at the chance to look after them on occasion.", "if someone decides to ask again after getting THAT harsh of a \"no\" then anything follows is totally on them.. also asking again kind of implies that it's more of an expectation and less of a request, which isn't great", "Yeah there\u2019s a big difference between not parenting your child and pushing them on someone else and having Uncle babysit one night every now and then for a date night.\n\nMore info needed", "Free labor ? Like do people here not get some sort of enjoyment from helping others out. I just don\u2019t get how this sub views family & friendship as purely transactional.", "My uncles NEVER watched us when we were kids. Literally never. They liked us, we always had fun at family events and have I have a good relationship with them now as an adult, but they never watched or babysat me. And my dad never watched my cousins. I think OP was a little harsh, one can easily say they aren't interested in future babysitting in a better way, but not every uncle babysits their nieces/nephews.", "How is this choice an asshole ish one?", "Lol, agreed. I made a comment asking if OP\u2019s sister actually asked him to babysit or if she just in general said that \u201cit takes a village\u201d and others offered to babysit.", "But I don't have to. My SILs and a couple friends are more than happy to spend a weekend enjoying a quiet apartment with their boyfriends or whatever. I don't understand the pet comparison at all. Pets are MUCH easier to handle than children.", "He definitely seems like the type to ignore his nieces/nephews until they\u2019re teens and then be surprised when they want nothing to do with him.", "Lol yeah no.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that OP, based on HIS tone, is exaggerating the actual discussion.\n\nSounds more like a typical \u201cone day when we have kids\u201d type convo that people have all the time with family.", "But that's not by any means the tone that OP indicated they said it in. \"we won't be a free food bank\" isn't respectful or a healthy way to set boundaries.", "I can\u2019t tell you how many times we fought them over that bull crap. We kept telling them over and over. We live in the country. The kids have 2+ acres to play on. We homeschool (always have). My bestie and her kids (my kids friends) visited regularly bc her husband works a family business so my husband was the only wild card going into work and they were ok with it. The only change was that Walmart delivered our groceries and library clubs were now virtual. They kept saying it was ok. That they had 5+ kids a week coming in with the same issue. I kept thinking...5 kids a week being neglected.", "Thank you.", "Thank you. She\u2019s alive and happy. That\u2019s all we care about at this point.", "Unreliable narrator, perhaps?", "I decided it must be sarcastic, because the other way is sociopathic.", "Lol I\u2019m assuming fump means dump", "That\u2019s fine. OP doesn\u2019t have to babysit but the way he\u2019s talking about fairly standard family practices is very negatively skewed when in all likelihood, this was his sister talking in general with her *loved* ones about what hypothetical support she would have in the future.\n\nEdit: what he\u2019s made it come across as is that she\u2019s assigning days of the week to different family members so she doesn\u2019t have to do a thing, which I would bet, isn\u2019t how she even said it at all.", "This is so off topic but please tell me \u201coily josh\u201d in your username is in reference to the translation of the name Jesus Christ \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The post says they\u2019ve asked the in-laws to watch the kids \u201conce in a while\u201d. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re asking for full time childcare 40 hours a week. \n\nAgain, families help each other out. My SIL lived at home to save money during college. My mom sold her old car to my brother for near nothing when he needed transportation. My husband taught my nephew industry skills to help him land a job. That\u2019s what families do. I would wager that OPs family already helps and supports each other in many different ways. It seems weird to get pre-angry about his sister seeking the same support when it\u2019s related to hypothetical children. Your logic of \u201cif you can\u2019t do it 100% by yourself, you shouldn\u2019t do it at all\u201d would not apply to any other situation. It seems odd to use that as the requirement for having children.", "So they can get an idea of how much family help they would have. It\u2019s good they are doing that now instead of making assumptions, then panicking after the baby is born. If the grandparents are willing to babysit, the parents won\u2019t need to pay a babysitter as often. \n\nI mean, if I were planning on having another kid, I\u2019d definitely put my feelers out to see how much help I would have. I wouldn\u2019t expect it, but I would definitely want to know.", "I raised 2 kids and I can think of maybe 5 times I had a true emergency and needed someone to get my kids. And they are both adults now. \n\nI also found as my kids where growing up that most of their friends where willing to help. You get your village not from family but friends. My kids friends mom and I would alternate pick up and drop off. It was a 2 way benefit. My friends son had football practice with my son. I take them or she take them. That\u2019s how you get a village to help.  Not demand free babysitting from family.\n\nThe situation the above person is talking about in all those years never happened except once and I was caught in a wreck. It wasn\u2019t family that helped out it was the above friends that knew I was Gone somewhere and had not heard from me so she went to the school. Actually your kids friends are better with pick ups and drop off then most grandparents and family. They already no the school routines. They are already familiar with school staff and protocols.", "I don't see anything in OP's post where it says that his sister has actually asked HIM to do anything at all. Seems like he's making some inferences based on conversations his sister has had with her parents and in-laws, but until she asks him for time, food or anything else, all he's doing is speculating, and berating her based on speculation. Which would make him TA.", "Totally agree that the OP\u2019s coming off more than a little biased here, especially when they refer to the grandparents babysitting once in a while as the parents not doing ANY parenting themselves.", "Exactly \n\n95% of grandparents don\u2019t need to be guilted into occasionally babysitting.", "Yeah, my parents watch my kids at least once a week, bc they ask to, bc they *shock* love their grandchildren and want to spend time with them. Posts like these honestly just make me sad that some people have an idea of family that is so far removed from my experience, with apparently no frame of reference for love and support from the people they're close to.", "After what OP has told us, do you think there\u2019s any possibility of this not being a constant fight? The sister is unreasonable.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re family was so uninvolved. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean everyone else needs to act like that", "I think saying you won\u2019t socialize with children is an assholeish choice. It\u2019s one OP has all the right to make, but it\u2019s still an assholeish choice. \n\nPerhaps this is personal bias but my opinions comes from the fact that most people I know who \u201cwon\u2019t socialize with children\u201d don\u2019t just stay in their own house and do their thing. They want the world around them to be childfree and make that clear any time a baby cries in a coffee shop.", "Yeah, if it's the latter, then OP might just be starting s**t!", "Absolutely. Plus if a child free person ever made the comparison, this sub would be full of \u201cfuR bAbiEs don\u2019T CoUNt\u201d and would be incandescent with rage at the thought of it.", "The pet comparison is more about asking for help. \n\nIf he ever needs help for ANYTHING, I hope he doesn't expect it from his sister... That's all...", "My mom and SIL and aunts never went around signing people up for free labor and financial responsibilities. Or if that language is inaccurate, they never asked people what contributions they could rely on them for in advance. My 3 sisters, the 3 living grandparents, and I are always ready to chip in with driving, babysitting, party set up, etc. for the niblings/grandkids, we actually consider it a privilege, not a chore, but our brother and SIL never talk or act like the TTC couple here do. At all. If they did, we wouldn't be so happy to be involved. And nobody is judged for ever saying No.", "You can read tone via text?", "Since the in laws are helping once in a while why is ops help so necessary that she needs to make a big drama out of it", "To me that sounds like they are preparing. Which means op stating they wont help lets them know ahead time. Op seems to have a negative feeling behind it all. Which make me wonder how much or little the sister exceptions of help and what people are actually wanting to provide is?", "They weren't uninvolved. We had tons of family events, went to ball games, the river, holidays, dinners, etc., they just never babysat us. I just went over and visited one of my uncles yesterday. I don't know, maybe it's a generational thing. My uncles are boomers and I'm in my 40's.", "So the question here isn't are they ta for generally not wanting to socialize with kids. I personally think that would be NTA since I also don't enjoy being around other people's kids. Don't get my wrong I love my niece and my little cousins, but it would be weird if I a grown ass man randomly hung out with children.\n\nThe question is are they an asshole for preemptively telling their inlaws that they won't help with the future hypothetical kids. The inlaws are already requesting/demanding it. In my view OP is just setting up boundaries so if/when the kids exist the inlaws aren't expecting support that isn't going to be there.", "Lol yeah, I don't get it? I just adopted a new kitten and it's been in a separate room for days with me and my bf alternating who gives her attention (as recommended by the vet because I have a 9yo SIC). She meows cutely every time we leave the room for 5 mins or so. She stays clean, drinks, eats and entertains herself. If babies were anything like that (specially $$-wise) I might just have had one or two of those myself hahaha these people are something else!!", "Yes, actually. It doesn't take much to know that \"we won't be your free food bank\" and using horrendous language to describe your family would lead to a bad tone. There's no Convo where the food bank comment would be interpreted as respectful. Youre grasping.", "You very clearly do not have children \ud83d\ude02 everything from my previous comment still stands.", "And my answer is that refusing to socialize with children and preemptively saying \u201cfuck your kids\u201d is an assholeish move, even if OP is technically right in doing it. You can be \u201cright\u201d and still come across like an asshole.", "Still, OP's silence is deafening.", "U clearly didn\u2019t get a word i said. Have a nice day", "The irony in this comment is truly astonishing \ud83d\ude02 but have a great night!"]}
