{"id": 24936, "submission_id": "15ul5f0", "title": "AITA because I don\u2019t want to visit my family anymore?", "selftext": "I (39F) moved to Europe nearly eight years ago and got married (2015). I have a nice job and my wife (45F) and I live comfortably \u2014 one cat, no kids. Just the way we always wanted it\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s expensive to fly back home (Texas/Tennessee), but I\u2019ve done it twice since. The plane ticket alone for my wife and I is up to 1,000\u20ac *each.* Not to mention the cost of a hotel (something we choose for ourselves to have space), food, other misc. expenses. \n\nMy sister doesn\u2019t work (SAHM) and had a baby in 2018 and we went to Texas to visit for two weeks. It was great because I became an aunt for the first time and got to see my sister who I hadn\u2019t seen in several years at this point. My mom also flew in during this time from Tennessee. \n\nI have always begged my sister or my mom to come visit me in Europe. I want to show them the life I\u2019ve made for myself here, teach/show them the culture, and admittedly, just feel the excitement of having them travel to see me. They\u2019ve always said things like, \u201cone day it\u2019ll happen.\u201d \n\nMy sister\u2019s excuse has always been that she has a young kid and can\u2019t just make spontaneous plans and travel. My mom\u2019s excuse is that she can\u2019t handle an international flight. She does have flight anxiety, but somehow she manages the 2-3 flights to Texas a few times a year. (Keep in mind my sister didn\u2019t have a baby the first few years I lived here.)\n\n2023 comes and my sister had her second child in June. At this point, I doubt she will ever visit. My mom already made her yearly trip to Texas and could seemingly care less about what\u2019s going on in my life. I\u2019ve been here 8 years and my mother doesn\u2019t even own a passport. I\u2019ve even encouraged her to get one at my own cost in the case of an emergency. She\u2019s just not interested. My sister and her husband do have passports. \n\nI\u2019ve pulled back from my family because of this. It was planned that we fly to Texas next year to meet my second niece, but I\u2019ve canceled that trip. I\u2019m tired of the effort being one-sided. It\u2019s also incredibly expensive. Mostly my heart isn\u2019t into it anymore because it honestly feels like I\u2019ve been put on the back burner. \n\nThe only time we really chat now is when it\u2019s about my sister\u2019s kids. Our family chat is nothing else but conversation about my sister\u2019s family. I throw a pic of my cat in there every now and then and the engagement is the bare minimum of a virtual heart. \n\nMy phone doesn\u2019t ring as much anymore. My private texts go unanswered most times or the replies I do get seem mundane. I\u2019ve stopped initiating communication from my end because what\u2019s the point? \n\nMy wife thinks I need to approach it differently because I\u2019m being a little selfish and unfair. She does understand my side and has expressed that, but she thinks canceling the trip next year is an overreaction. AITA because I don\u2019t want to go anymore?\n\n**Edit:** added that my sister is a SAHM, corrected spelling errors\n\n**Second edit:** Some people keep bringing up the financial burden that my family might have coming to visit me. I never said either of them were struggling in that sense, so please stop assuming they can\u2019t afford it. Both can. It\u2019s not about money or time, but rather about desire and effort. They both have expressed repeatedly that they want to. I don\u2019t know when that time will come at this point, if ever. \n\nAlso, I understand the few that are concerned that my mother has flight anxiety and feel that I\u2019m overlooking that. She can fly and she does multiple times a year, but she just gets extremely nervous. The idea of an international flight doesn\u2019t excite her, but it doesn\u2019t prevent her either. She has said she is willing to tackle it. She just\u2026 isn\u2019t.\n\nSome people took what I initially wrote and made me out to be a monster that wants to put a small, terrified old lady on a long flight against her will. My own mother would laugh at that! Hopefully this clarifies that.\n\nLastly, me moving abroad was not with the expectation that I would be dropped like a hot potato. We all knew our family dynamic would change, but to this degree? Can\u2019t say I saw it coming.", "created_utc": 1692366649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ul5f0/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_visit_my_family/", "score": 322, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I moved to Europe from New York 12 years ago. I built my life here. It was a real struggle to keep in contact with my siblings. It always felt like a one-way street to me.

Since then we have grown our relationship to be  incredibly close. \n\nIt's fairly common that the person who chooses the uncommon path in their life has to do more to reach out to maintain those relationships. It's not right, it's just reality. Subconsciously they may just feel like you are the one who created the situation of it being such a pain to visit, so it should be you to reach out. \n\nWhen I stopped caring about how often somebody reached out to me, and just evaluated the relationship. And was it something that I wanted to nurture I let go of a lot of that resentment.\n\nIt's fair to feel hurt. It's fair to feel frustrated.

Your sister and the husband could have visited before extending their family.

Your been an ass to yourself", "NTA, if that's your prerogative .\n\nBut I never understood really why people care and depend so much on seldom or solitary visits as a way to keep close to family. As a benchmark for closeness. Even if your family visited you once or twice a year, it's still just a visit. I can understand if they hadn't been at all, and you want them to see the life that you're proud of. \n\nBut everything they are seeing, is in this false bubble of showing. Like animal exhibits in the zoo. It never made me feel closer to anybody. I would rather have more regular communication with them. If that's the trade-off.

I know my in laws refused a free trip to Paris last year bc they think evil union workers are burning the ciry down and killing everyone.  When we sent them pics of us picnicking next to the Seine, they accused us of lying about being in Paris.  The eiffel tower was in the background of our picture....\n\nHave your family members ever traveled abroad before? It might just be a fear thing. Or maybe a money thing.

Relationships need to be reciprocal, otherwise they tend to fizzle out as it's too much effort for one person to do all the work.

Eventually you gotta make the choice to make a turn or keep going in a direction knowing there is no destination ahead.", "NTA but with a caveat. I think it\u2019s perfectly fair to be upset with them for not making an effort to stay in touch with you. If the pandemic taught us anything, it\u2019s that it possible to maintain relationships from a distance. However I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold it against them that they\u2019re not coming to visit you. Regarding your mom, you admit she has flight anxiety. It\u2019s easy to push through that for a quick domestic flight, like from Tennessee to Texas but international travel is a completely different beast. It\u2019s stressful and uncomfortable so if someone already has anxiety about flying, an international flight is going to be out of the question. As for your sister, she and her husband have a single income household. It\u2019s not reasonable to be upset with her for not wanting to spend money to go to Europe.

I would want to show my family around Europe and even show off my lifestyle a bit. But the reality is that you chose to leave the continent. You chose to be far away. Not them. They may be afraid of traveling. They may have cost barriers. They may have a hundred reasons why making the journey is not appealing to them. This is a consequence of moving far away unfortunately. I\u2019m sure your sister has had moments where she wishes your mom was more present in her life or in her kids. But she lives in a different state. So that\u2019s just not an option. \n\nYou guys are spread out. It\u2019s easier for you to travel than them. It just is what it is at this point.

But I\u2019ll play devils advocate. My sister or daughter moved to a different continent to be with her wife\u2019s family. She chose to leave her family behind. It took three years and a major life event before she came to see any of us. She\u2019s only made two trips total in all that time.

But part of doing that (especially if you don't tell them you're doing that/what the problem is) is that a relationship that's mostly been maintained from your side may basically evaporate entirely if you stop. Especially if, again, you don't tell them why you're stopping. That's probably what your wife is worried about, that you're feeling upset/like they don't care enough but may regret it later if you let things devolve now. Do you want to never meet your newest nibling? Are you fine with them growing up without knowing you as more than a distant face in some old pictures? To be clear, it's totally okay if you are! Sometimes, people drift apart and that's normal. But if you're making a concious choice to end things, then examine all the repercussions first.\n\nAlso, have you ever invited your family to a specific thing/event or sat them down to plan out dates, or just generally waited for them to sort it out themselves?

Not a single friend, sibling or anyone else has made an effort despite my traveling abroad for weddings, christenings and big birthdays for them. \n\nI used to feel guilty about how little I interact with most of them now, but honestly, I realized that they can\u2019t really care that much if they have never made the effort in over a decade.

My mother FaceTimes her other grandkids weekly but not my daughter. She called daughter first time in 9 months because I was not answering anymore to ask for money.

I'm the one who moved far away and I used to get so frustrated that my family wouldn't put it as much effort. It took an old lady at a park one day describing to me how it felt when her daughter moved across the country, and looking me in the eyes and saying \"you have to understand, you're the one who made the choice to go so far, your family didn't have a say in that choice\" for me to finally understand. I made the choice, and so yes, more of the \"cost\" of that choice needs to fall onto me. \n\nThat little old lady in the park really reframed things for me and made my stop trying to see my family as having to do \"equal effort\" in the relationship.

If you had conversations with her prior, then why are you surprised that the results were as predicted? Did she not express reluctance at you moving abroad during those conversations?", "They don\u2019t travel much within the US and just got their passports last year, but say what you feel is necessary I guess.", ">I\u2019ve seen here (in other families) one member of the family will fly out to accompany their parent on their flight to visit (so the family member flies out and then back in with their parent). I am guessing you wouldn\u2019t want to do that but I\u2019ve seen it work well.\n\nWe were absolutely willing to have one of us do this. My mother declined.", "Right\u2014her thought process is silly. \u201cOur relationships aren\u2019t great right now because I moved away. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to make them worse\u2026for no reason.\u201d", "She encouraged me to move. It was a rare opportunity that she felt suited me well. So, I moved. It doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t consider the emotional impact it would have on my family, but we\u2019ve also had many conversations where they said they would visit us that never came to fruition. I\u2019m allowed to be a little upset. Blink once and 8 years have passed.", "Oof, that's rough OP", "I do live in Germany, but most Germans speak English. The countries she could go through to get here are English speaking. Signs are in both German and English. I didn\u2019t get lost when I first came here and she wouldn\u2019t either. My mother is a wise woman.", "Just going to a busy airport can be overwhelming."]}
