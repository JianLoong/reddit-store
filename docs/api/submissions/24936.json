{"id": 24936, "submission_id": "15ul5f0", "title": "AITA because I don\u2019t want to visit my family anymore?", "selftext": "I (39F) moved to Europe nearly eight years ago and got married (2015). I have a nice job and my wife (45F) and I live comfortably \u2014 one cat, no kids. Just the way we always wanted it\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s expensive to fly back home (Texas/Tennessee), but I\u2019ve done it twice since. The plane ticket alone for my wife and I is up to 1,000\u20ac *each.* Not to mention the cost of a hotel (something we choose for ourselves to have space), food, other misc. expenses. \n\nMy sister doesn\u2019t work (SAHM) and had a baby in 2018 and we went to Texas to visit for two weeks. It was great because I became an aunt for the first time and got to see my sister who I hadn\u2019t seen in several years at this point. My mom also flew in during this time from Tennessee. \n\nI have always begged my sister or my mom to come visit me in Europe. I want to show them the life I\u2019ve made for myself here, teach/show them the culture, and admittedly, just feel the excitement of having them travel to see me. They\u2019ve always said things like, \u201cone day it\u2019ll happen.\u201d \n\nMy sister\u2019s excuse has always been that she has a young kid and can\u2019t just make spontaneous plans and travel. My mom\u2019s excuse is that she can\u2019t handle an international flight. She does have flight anxiety, but somehow she manages the 2-3 flights to Texas a few times a year. (Keep in mind my sister didn\u2019t have a baby the first few years I lived here.)\n\n2023 comes and my sister had her second child in June. At this point, I doubt she will ever visit. My mom already made her yearly trip to Texas and could seemingly care less about what\u2019s going on in my life. I\u2019ve been here 8 years and my mother doesn\u2019t even own a passport. I\u2019ve even encouraged her to get one at my own cost in the case of an emergency. She\u2019s just not interested. My sister and her husband do have passports. \n\nI\u2019ve pulled back from my family because of this. It was planned that we fly to Texas next year to meet my second niece, but I\u2019ve canceled that trip. I\u2019m tired of the effort being one-sided. It\u2019s also incredibly expensive. Mostly my heart isn\u2019t into it anymore because it honestly feels like I\u2019ve been put on the back burner. \n\nThe only time we really chat now is when it\u2019s about my sister\u2019s kids. Our family chat is nothing else but conversation about my sister\u2019s family. I throw a pic of my cat in there every now and then and the engagement is the bare minimum of a virtual heart. \n\nMy phone doesn\u2019t ring as much anymore. My private texts go unanswered most times or the replies I do get seem mundane. I\u2019ve stopped initiating communication from my end because what\u2019s the point? \n\nMy wife thinks I need to approach it differently because I\u2019m being a little selfish and unfair. She does understand my side and has expressed that, but she thinks canceling the trip next year is an overreaction. AITA because I don\u2019t want to go anymore?\n\n**Edit:** added that my sister is a SAHM, corrected spelling errors\n\n**Second edit:** Some people keep bringing up the financial burden that my family might have coming to visit me. I never said either of them were struggling in that sense, so please stop assuming they can\u2019t afford it. Both can. It\u2019s not about money or time, but rather about desire and effort. They both have expressed repeatedly that they want to. I don\u2019t know when that time will come at this point, if ever. \n\nAlso, I understand the few that are concerned that my mother has anxiety when flying and feel that I\u2019m overlooking that. She can fly and she does multiple times a year, but she just gets extremely nervous. The idea of an international flight doesn\u2019t excite her, but it doesn\u2019t prevent her either. She has said she is willing to tackle it. She just hasn\u2019t. \n\nSome people took what I initially wrote and made me out to be a monster that wants to put a small, terrified old lady on a long flight against her will. My own mother would laugh at that! Hopefully this clarifies that.\n\nLastly, me moving abroad was not with the expectation that I would be dropped like a hot potato. We all knew our family dynamic would change, but to this degree? Can\u2019t say I saw it coming. I have expressed to them before that I feel like things have changed between us, but those conversations tend to only improve things short-term.", "created_utc": 1692366649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ul5f0/aita_because_i_dont_want_to_visit_my_family/", "score": 901, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can understand if they hadn't been at all, and you want them to see the life that you're proud of. \n\nBut everything they are seeing, is in this false bubble of showing. Like animal exhibits in the zoo. It never made me feel closer to anybody. I would rather have more regular communication with them. If that's the trade-off.

I think it\u2019s perfectly fair to be upset with them for not making an effort to stay in touch with you.

However I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold it against them that they\u2019re not coming to visit you. Regarding your mom, you admit she has flight anxiety. It\u2019s easy to push through that for a quick domestic flight, like from Tennessee to Texas but international travel is a completely different beast. It\u2019s stressful and uncomfortable so if someone already has anxiety about flying, an international flight is going to be out of the question. As for your sister, she and her husband have a single income household. It\u2019s not reasonable to be upset with her for not wanting to spend money to go to Europe. She and her husband may not even have the money to go. \n\nI would talk your family about not expressing interest in your life but I think you should drop the travel issue.

I would want to show my family around Europe and even show off my lifestyle a bit. But the reality is that you chose to leave the continent. You chose to be far away. Not them. They may be afraid of traveling. They may have cost barriers. They may have a hundred reasons why making the journey is not appealing to them. This is a consequence of moving far away unfortunately. I\u2019m sure your sister has had moments where she wishes your mom was more present in her life or in her kids. But she lives in a different state. So that\u2019s just not an option. \n\nYou guys are spread out. It\u2019s easier for you to travel than them. It just is what it is at this point.

But I\u2019ll play devils advocate. My sister or daughter moved to a different continent to be with her wife\u2019s family. She chose to leave her family behind. It took three years and a major life event before she came to see any of us. She\u2019s only made two trips total in all that time.

I\u2019ve got small children I care for full time or I\u2019m getting older and just a little more tired these days.

Especially if, again, you don't tell them why you're stopping. That's probably what your wife is worried about, that you're feeling upset/like they don't care enough but may regret it later if you let things devolve now. Do you want to never meet your newest nibling? Are you fine with them growing up without knowing you as more than a distant face in some old pictures? To be clear, it's totally okay if you are! Sometimes, people drift apart and that's normal. But if you're making a concious choice to end things, then examine all the repercussions first.\n\nAlso, have you ever invited your family to a specific thing/event or sat them down to plan out dates, or just generally waited for them to sort it out themselves?

I'm the one who moved far away and I used to get so frustrated that my family wouldn't put it as much effort.

I made the choice, and so yes, more of the \"cost\" of that choice needs to fall onto me. \n\nThat little old lady in the park really reframed things for me and made my stop trying to see my family as having to do \"equal effort\" in the relationship.

The countries she could go through to get here are English speaking. Signs are in both German and English. I didn\u2019t get lost when I first came here and she wouldn\u2019t either. My mother is a wise woman.", "Just going to a busy airport can be overwhelming.", "You\u2019re the one that moved to Europe. And your edit doesn\u2019t help. Just because you\u2019re assuming they can afford the flight doesn\u2019t mean that the money isn\u2019t already earmarked for something else. I could buy a ticket to Europe right now too, but there\u2019s other things I\u2019d rather do with the money that would be better for me financially. I don\u2019t blame your sister one bit for not wanting to tackle an international flight with two kids. And I think you\u2019re being very unsympathetic to your mother. As someone with anxiety, I can tell you, it\u2019s hard to handle and emotionally exhausting. You\u2019re downplaying her anxiety because you want us to agree with you. I don\u2019t though. You should be the one to fly.", "Everyone has told you why they don't come but you're making your own narrative.   Flight anxiety is probably different on a 1 hour flight vs a 10 hour flight. New moms don't want to leave their babies to fly to another country for fun. It's not the same as having a cat. Your reasoning for not wanting to go is just that you're salty.  If you cancel this trip YTA. And if you decide to cut out your family in the future after this trip that's your decision but fyi you're the one who moved to Europe, did you never consider that your family feels abandoned by you? Because my family does. 15 years ago I moved 3,000 miles from my family. My mom has come once, to be with me when I experienced a death and my sister has come once just last month, my other sister has never come. Of course I feel the way you feel and want them to be interested in my life and where I live. I thought they would be excited to take a trip but they aren't and they also all sort of feel like I don't think my home state is good enough because I moved, like I think I am better than them or my hometown or something. But I am the one who moved so I am the one who makes the trip home.", "As someone who\u2019s lived long distance from family and felt the exact same way, NAH but y-wbta to yourself if you allow yourself to cancel. \n\nIt sounds like your family is very similar to both mine and my in-laws. Neither side of family are travelers, you could offer the US debt value in cash to have had them visit us when we lived long distance and they would\u2019ve declined. Without getting into their brains I have no idea their refusal to travel- my in laws tend to be in their own little world and don\u2019t visit unless we repeatedly ask, my own family I think there was the expectation almost that since we were the ones who moved, there was the expectation that we would be the ones to visit. I do know for my family, I have a cousin-like-sister who has little ones and when she lived long distance it was hell to wrangle them on a plane to come visit, even with an active husband also playing wrangler. So for her, we would try to go visit her as much as we could when she lived long distance, because it\u2019s a lot less logistics for us to trek there, than vice versa. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your family is abusive or neglectful, so I\u2019d hate to see you throw away your connection with them over what sounds like a logistical issue. Is it fair that there\u2019s that expectation that you are the one to come visit, no. Does it suck, yes. Are you going to change it, probably not. Are you going to regret not visiting when you were able to, that\u2019s something only you can answer. I know when we lived long distance, the answer was yes we would regret it if we didn\u2019t visit simply because we were mad at the unfairness. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA I\u2019m sorry I know it\u2019s hard when you want to spend time with family but a domestic trip that is half the time of the international trip to go see you is a world of difference. I live in Australia where we often have to drive hours to see family cause Australia is massive but when I lived 20 mins drive from my sister she rarely visited me then I moved back to our \u201chometown \u201c and she decided to move 30 mins away you bet I\u2019m not driving to vist her. I\u2019ve had kids since I lived \u201caway\u201d from her and I\u2019ve had to be the one to put the effort in and travelling with kids sucks ass seriously a 30 min drive can be an absolute nightmare there\u2019s no way I\u2019d do an 8 hour flight with small children when my sister chose to be that far away. \n\nMoving away and staring a new life can be a massive important thing I understand but if you change the family dynamic you need to be the one to put in effort to maintain that especially for family that is less well off then you and has struggles that you don\u2019t. It comes down to what each of the family members prioritises as important for you that might be visits as spending quality time whereas for your sister it might be rent and having stability for her kids. International trips don\u2019t tie into her life goals and that\u2019s ok. It doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t care about your relationship it just means her finances and life situation is different to yours.", "NAH\n\nYou chose to move. International travel is so different from domestic. You created a dynamic where it is harder for them to see you. \n\nYou say you're both comfortable but you still mention how much it costs you. Maybe you have no idea how comfortable they are with their finances and yo are not close enough to know if they can afford that cost. \n\nPeople drift apart. You could try having an open conversation with them, not looking to blame them, but just stating what you need. If they still don't care to talk more, then you'll have your answer and can adjust your expectations of them to more realistic levels. \n\nUnreasonable expectations cause us to get hurt. If this is how they are, you will have to face that reality and focus on the people who do love and care about you!", "You've made a choice to move overseas, and put incredible distance between yourself and your family. It's nice to invite them and hope they might come...but realistically, many family members won't. (Yes, I know some will! That doesn't mean it's everyone's cup of tea.) \n\nIt's not fair to make yourself less accessible and then get upset when people don't jump through hoops to get to you. It is actually healthiest for most humans to focus on the relationships around them, on the daily. \n\nAnd it's really unfair to assume because they can financially afford it, that they have the resources to do it. Travel takes stamina, courage, resiliency, planning, time, and most importantly, time away from the things you have and nurture at HOME. It's not for everyone. \n\nI have a delusional family member who wants to move far away and expects visits when s/he does. It's not happening. Sorry. It's HIS/HER choice, not ours. We live in reality, and in reality, a big trip is beyond our family's resources. I'm not saying we can't afford it financially. It's just beyond our personal resources. \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.

While my parents have visted me once in the 6 years I have lived here and my brothers have not visted me due to life circumstances (pandemic, babies being born, limited vacation time), I can not expect them to come to me when I made the choice to move away. I know that they want to, but I also have to recognize that it is easier for my family to see each other as they all still live in the same country. So I go to them once or twice a year because it was my choice to leave just like it was your choice to move to another country. I know it sucks and it hurts not seeing your family and wanting to show them the life you are living. I think you need to accept that life is tough and depending on jobs it can  be hard to find the time to travel abroad or afford it.

That said, I think you need to be more compassionate towards each of your mom and your sister.  When your mom (who I assume is in her mid 60s or older) system that flying internationally is hard for her, believe her.  As you know, you have to get to the airport sooner, wait in longer lines, and make other preparations that you normally would not for domestic travel.  Also, if she still flies to Texas, it may not be a sign that she is lying to you about how much she hates flying but that she is really genuinely trying desperately to o ercome her fear so that she can go see her daughter and her grandchildren.  \n\nAs for your sister, when you have a child, it is hard enough to go out to dinner, much less take a week off to travel to Europe.  I am not sure that you fully understand just how all-consuming being a parent is.  \n\nWhile I fully appreciate your situation, I think you are allowing your growing resentment to color how you see the situation that you mom and sister are in.  I'd advise you to be more understanding and charitable, because being family means being there for each other in times of need and it sounds like they are in much greater need at this stage of their life than you.", "NAH. I\u2019m not sure what you were expecting when you moved but I sympathize with your feeling left out. But it\u2019s also kind of a normal dynamic in a family where there are grandkids. \n\nI don\u2019t think YTA for wanting to pull back but it\u2019s not going to make your family feel bad or reach out more. If you pull back, you\u2019re just going to accelerate the division between you and your family. \n\nMany people love to travel abroad and think nothing of it. But it\u2019s pretty common for a lot of Americans not to want to travel abroad. There are folks who live within an hour of the Mexican or Canadian border who have never visited and don\u2019t have passports. Unfortunately for you, your family members seem to be folks who don\u2019t value travel and aren\u2019t likely to enjoy it. \n\nI think your wife is right and you do need to take a real look at the situation. You need to understand that your family members are who they are. Your mom and sister are adults. They\u2019ve had a long time to get their minds around traveling to see you and it hasn\u2019t happened you continuing to expect them to do something that it\u2019s pretty clear they don\u2019t want to do is kind of the definition of insanity.  \n\nYou can either keep wishing them for them to be different than the people you\u2019ve known them to be for many years now it seems, or you can decide that you\u2019re going to continue to travel because you want to have at least some relationship with them. But expecting them to suddenly change is going to be an exercise and disappointment as it has already been for you.\n\nBut this really isn\u2019t about travel. It\u2019s really about feeling disconnected from them and like they don\u2019t care. That is understandable. \n\nBut traveling to see each other isn\u2019t the only way for you to build that connection.  We live in a world of technology. You could pick up the phone, or try to schedule a zoom call so that you can see your sister\u2019s kids and develop a relationship with them, and maybe through that get closer to your family. You could send gifts or postcards from where you live to try and share Your life with them and maybe encourage them to come and visit you.  Maybe you cut your visits back to every other year, and use that money to enjoy yourselves in the alternate years traveling near where you live now. \n\nI really hope you do find a way to connect with your family. It\u2019s clear it\u2019s something you really want but forcing them to do it in the way that you want them to do it probably isn\u2019t gonna get you anywhere and simply cutting them off and expecting them to come scrambling after you isn\u2019t going to help.", "NAH - but you really can't expect to move overseas, have no children, and expect people to visit.   You even admit you've flown to them twice in 8 years and one time was to see a new baby.  Vacation time is limited in the states, they might have the money, but a family vacation with the kids might take precedence over an international trip to visit someone who is barely around.

You got to live with your choice now.", "NAH, I know you didn't *expect* that moving to Europe would negatively impact your family relationships, but I'm not sure what you did expect.

I have never once expected them to come visit because it's much more onerous for them to do it than it is for me, traveling solo, to do it.  That's one of the costs of moving a long distance away, you have the burden of travel costs if you want to see your family.\n\nAnd yes, the nature of the distance means you will largely be put on the back burner.

That\u2019s how it goes. \n\nYour mother is always going to put little grandchildren over you, and your sister flying long haul with kids is a challenge to say the least. \n\nYou may think your life is exciting or even better but they might view it as strange, or uppity. They don\u2019t want to learn how great the culture you left them for is. \n\nI say this as a European very familiar with American sensibilities- most Americans don\u2019t own a passport, they are an insular nation who often don\u2019t understand why you\u2019d want to leave a country you pledged daily allegiance to (SO WEIRD BTW). \n\nCancelling your trip is you cutting yourself out, but you need to accept that\u2019s a choice you are making, not them.

And then a little less, and a little less, and now I visit about 1-2 times a year. Which really upsets them all. My parents and brother are all young and healthy.

But as time passed, I realized this is what they had to offer and it did not mean they loved me less, but rather that I wished they loved me in a different way. You can accept it or don't but from what you've written, I don't think they are trying to hurt you but it sounds like you want to hurt them for hurting you and have plans to make that happen. That's very human amd understandable, but it is what makes you the AH.", "My family had a similar problem. I was ok with flying over land, but flying over ocean was too much. I also weighed the importance of the trip against how I would feel if there was an accident and someone was killed or injured. Visiting the sibling in Europe just wasnt worth the tiny but real risk.", "NTA. Relationships are a two way street. It doesn't sound much like they want to actually see you, so it's not surprising that you don't want to go! So don't go for awhile. Keep the parts of the relationship that are working for you and let the rest go.", "Yeah. This is my situation too. I moved to a different country and my family forgot about me. They make no effort at all. I haven\u2019t spoken to my mother in five months because she doesn\u2019t even care to call and when I try to call she says she couldn\u2019t figure out how to answer the phone. But in my case I was always the least favourite child growing up so the move just kind of cemented the existing ranking. Was that also the case for you I wonder? At any rate definitely NTA. Just stop investing in your family-you will only get hurt. Do you at least have a good relationship with your wife\u2019s family?", "NTA. Relationships are a two way street, even with family. It sounds like you've put in a fair amount of effort to stay communicative with them, and have visited them a few times and they won't reciprocate. \n\n\nRegardless of their reasons, it's a bit unfair for you. I don't think you're family are monsters or anything though, and neither are you. \n\n\nHave you outwardly expressed to them that you feel neglected? And not just saying \"when will you visit me?\", but actually bringing up how you're feeling about them not visiting?", "Nah.\n\nYour family doesn't really care. Your sister has her life and you're not part of it. Your mom has her life And you're not part of it either. If I'm going to be cynical, I think the fact you're gay with no kids might have something to do with the lack of interest.\n\nFamilies aren't meant to be forever. They grow apart and people do their own thing.  It's up to you to keep chasing their attention and or just go where you're wanted.", "I joined the Navy at 18 years old and was stationed on the opposite side of the country from where I grew up. My parents divorced when I was 7. One parent visited me annually, the other constantly asked \u201cWhen are you gonna come visit me?\u201d. That got old real quick.\n\nI eventually stopped responding to his texts and calls. When I received a text on my daughters 4th birthday asking me to \u201cGive my granddaughter a kiss for me\u201d I finally lost it. I sent a very scathing text explaining that he didn\u2019t have a grandchild and to lose my number permanently. \n\nI got the call that he\u2019d died of a heart attack this March. I\u2019m not happy about the way things transpired, I would have loved for my daughter to have had him around because he really was an awesome person to spend time with; but he didn\u2019t have a desire to be around. When you were in his presence, he made sure everything was enjoyable and that you felt welcome, but he never put any effort into being present in my life. It was a convenience (for him, nobody else) based relationship.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t change anything about how I dealt with him. I\u2019m sad it played out the way it did, but I have no regrets about how I reacted given his behavior. Cut them loose and see what type of effort they put into their relationship with you.", "Here's the issue- YOU chose to move abroad. Your family didn't get a say. When you chose to live in Europe, you took on the burden of visiting them, not the other way around. If you are upset that you don't see them more, that's 100% on you. The person who moved away inflicted their choice on everyone else. For this reason YTA.", "I lived abroad for close to 20 years and often felt the dynamic you\u2019re describing. I\u2019d come back maybe 1/1.5 years. We were all pretty bad at staying in touch and the only person to visit me was my sister and BIL over the holidays in 2015. Theirs was the only visit by ANY family member in 20 years while I was making a semi-regular trip back to them. Ngl, it was hurtful. I felt very disconnected from them. \n\nWhen my niece was born in 2016, I feel like we all started making an effort. Regular FaceTime catch ups while I was prepping dinner, for example, not just when there was big news. Now I\u2019m on the same continent (but not in the same country) and visits between all of us are more frequent. \n\nI empathize with your predicament, but I\u2019m inclined to say NAH. Americans are very constrained when it comes to taking the time off (work or life) to make a trip like that worth it, the accumulated expenses of eating/drinking out for that period of time, the worry about healthcare and the like abroad, etc. No, your mother doesn\u2019t even have a passport, and that should tell you where her comfort levels are. \n\nDoes living this way seem particularly imaginative or adventurous? Not to you or me, perhaps, but maybe adjust your expectations before you cut them off. Y\u2019all can organize something in Baton Rouge or Colorado or somewhere a bit more \u2018familiar\u2019 as a way of injecting a adventure into your meet ups without pushing them too far out of their comfort zones and also make you feel like they\u2019re putting in a *little* more effort than they\u2019ve put in thus far, which I know is a valid pain point for you.", "NAH. My siblings and I have had this discussion often. My brother and I lived internationally and a sister lived in a different state from parents.\n\nWe were always bummed that nobody traveled to see us but it is a burden. Just because someone can fly from TX to TN doesn't mean they're willing to tough it for international travel.\n\nYou had to have assumed you wouldn't see them as often. Also, if someone said they wanted to \"teach me\" about their new culture and I was also responsible for travel expenses and time, I probably wouldn't rush over for the lesson.\n\nIf you enjoy seeing your niece/new baby and like travel, then it doesn't make sense to cancel because you hope they come see you?\n\nI wouldn't push it with them and keep the invitation open. Tell them it is hurtful that they're not making plans to visit your new home. \n\nMaybe they'll come through but don't punish yourself by not visiting if you want to.", "NTA. I am relating so hard right now. The disappointment and the complete lack of prioritizing or interest is hard to take. \n\nMy family is also on both sides of the Atlantic and we have also had to deal with non-visiting relatives. My sister does visit once or twice a year and we visit ourselves once a year. So no issues there. The plane tickets prices and hotel prices are eyewatering which strains our finances but we\u2019re happy to absorb that also because we need to get out of our island for our mental health. My husband\u2019s family never visits. Ever. Well, his sister and family once visited him before we met. We got married during the pandemic and his mom was unable to make because she lives in another country than my SIL and my sister and we had no idea if she was even allowed to fly in. So it was fair enough. SIL, however, thought it was too much trouble (her own words) and opted out after promising religiously herself they would ALL be there, in spite of quarantine. It was definitely possible to fly in with a free 5 day quarantine in a hotel room. My sister and her now ex did that for us gladly. But SIL, no. She even made a lot of fuss trying to force us to understand her view when we visited the year after that. No sorry, no self reflection, only \u201cYou got mad at me for failing my promise so now I\u2019m the victim\u201d. Mind you we spent a large amount of money to come to their latest big celebration. I had to watch my husband hurt during our wedding days because almost no one came to be with him on our big day. Out of two parents and 3 siblings only his dad came, and only because my husband paid for his ticket for a domestic flight. And this year SIL and MIL almost bought a ticket but then cancel so fast when they realized we had bought tickets for a summer holiday. Well, we are visiting the country now and after 2 weeks we still have yet to see any of my husband\u2019s relatives. We have a newborn baby and so we have chosen to keep stops to an absolute minimum and will not be visiting MIL\u2019s or SIL\u2019s houses because it takes so much energy to get there. We\u2019re not even really allowed to sleep over at SIL\u2019s house so we\u2019re forced to take several bus and train rides in the evening when baby and big brother are tired. They are more than welcome to come during the weekend or sleep in the same hotel. SIL is too busy and MIL thinks that one night hotel room is too expensive so she will come by and go home in the evening. Remember she just saved a lot of money on plane tickets. At this rate, they will meet the new member of the family for a few hours this year even though we are visiting for 25 days. F)@\u201c this sh&@. I have told my husband I might not be willing to spend that much money next year when the effort and economic hit is so onesided. Why not see the world with this kind of money?! So, after this novel, I can so relate. It\u2019s so disappointing.", "Relationships take work, on both sides.  \n\nIt seems that more of the responsibility for visiting falls on the person who moved out of the state or country for a couple of reasons.  1. You chose to move that far away.  2. You are one person traveling as opposed to however many people you will see in your home country traveling to where you live.  More bang for the buck, so to speak.\n\nConversations revolve around things you have in common and parents' lives tend to revolve around their children.\n\nSince you don't have children, you probably don't know what an expedition it can be to travel ANYWHERE  with them, much less overseas.

Give your mom a break.\n\nGet on a plane and visit your family.  They won't always be around.", "nta!!! I only moved to a neighboring state (5 hour drive from hometown) and no one in my family has ever come to visit. my father in law has only come once to visit from my husbands side (husband and I are from the same town). so when I do drive out to california, I do not go visit family even though I stay in my hometown when I visit. I get guilt laced messages from family members when they see i\u2019m in town. however, I do not ever receive messages from family at any other point. it\u2019s always me checking in and calling every so often, I decided to stop to see if anyone would reach out to me, it\u2019s been about 6 months and not a single person has. you are entirely justified in not spending any more time or money on those who won\u2019t do the same for you.", "I feel OP's pain.  Moved from the west coast to the east coast and have had exactly two visits from my family.  Once for about 1/2 an hours while my sis and her family were passing through on the way to Disney, and the second (which I paid for) after my sister filed for divorce.  I've visited them ten to twelve times.  \n\nI finally gave up and just quit trying.  No phone calls, barely any contact on the socials...not even a christmas card most years.   These days I only hear from them when they need something.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Distance creates distance so to speak. You\u2019re not a part of their daily dynamic anymore, you won\u2019t be close. You just have to accept that all the effort to travel will be made by you, they\u2019re not the AH because they don\u2019t want to travel internationally. It\u2019s a hassle to fly that long and far, not everyone wants to do that. \n\nIt\u2019s also not crazy that you have negative feelings about all of this. It hurts to look in the family album and see yourself missing.", "NTA, but im willing to bet your family ignores you because you're the gay kid that lives overseas. They may not be out right homophobic but it feels like an \"out of sight, out of mind\" thing. It's a l lot easier to just ignore a gay kid when they live far enough away that there is a litany of excuses that don't seem sus on the outside as to why you don't see/talk to them much. \n\nI hope im wrong for the record.", "NAH. I'm a fellow expat/immigrant. It took over 5 years, a family crisis, and an enormous personal achievement to get my parents to visit for the first time this year. I get that the onus is on the expat to visit more, but it sucks to feel like your loved ones don't care about seeing the life you've created and live every day.\n\nAs hard as it can be for those we left behind, for them life continues on and they are still surrounded by family and friends. For ex-pats, it's not like that. We may have our spouses, but we left everyone (some of us eagerly, others less so) and are extremely isolated in foreign cultures. It's extremely hard for non-expats to understand.\n\nI recommend seeking out expat groups for your country/city and also checking out the Grumpy Expat community - it's cathartic in so many ways (they do a screaming into the void every week where you can rant about your chosen country, your home country, the people you left, or whatever you want).", "NTA", "NAH/ESH\n\nThis kind of has similarities with the relationship in my family but\u2026 not. I guess my perspective would be like your mom/sister than you. \n\nSo, when my youngest sibling was in elementary or middle school and I was in college, my parents divorced and my mom moved out to a city that was about an hour drive away. We made attempts to visit her at least once a week and this lasted for a few months.\n\nThe effort on her end\u2026she came by to our house maybe once a month, twice at most and sometimes because she\u2019d thought she would stop by after work since it\u2019s on the way or she had a doctors appt in our city that day or she was going to meet up with someone. \n\nI felt our relationship was diminishing (? Idk if this is the right word). Maybe we\u2019d talk about what\u2019s going on with our lives but it wasn\u2019t much. We didn\u2019t do much together either. I guess we expected her to make plans to do stuff as she was the parent. She would just come over and chill at our house and go on social media if she wasn\u2019t talking to us. Sometimes we would go out to eat. \n\nAfter a couple of years of this, I found that I lost interest in maintaining a relationship with her. (Of course, other things came into play but that\u2019s a whole bunch of other stories I\u2019m not getting into.) \n\nI see it as\u2026 she\u2019s the one who moved away and pretty far for us, imo. (I know for some ppl that\u2019s their drive to work and do it 5 times a week but that\u2019s not my thing.) She moved away from us so why do my siblings and I have to go out of our way to see her? We barely see her, she should be making plans to do stuff with us, especially since she\u2019s the parent. Instead of making plans with/for us, she makes plans with other ppl (some of them are strangers to her) to go try new restaurants or activities. \n\nAgain, this story is not even close to yours but it is kind of the same with one family member moving a good distance away. I understand your disappointment and frustrations with your family not even making an effort to visit you even once to see your \u201cnew\u201d life with your wife. I can also see their perspective from not wanting to go out of their way to make the trip. \n\nI think you should have another conversation with your family. They keep saying \u201cone day\u201d but nothing is getting solidified in the planning. Maybe you should take the lead on this. Pick a season/year you think is reasonable for all parties (kids\u2019 ages, school, work commitments,  etc.) and tell them to keep that time free. Then, following that conversation, start planning some stuff that you would like to show them and get them involved (sightseeing, attractions, cuisine).  They may end up actually interested in wanting to go visit you and your wife. \n\nSide note: I\u2019m sorry but you mentioned that you would send your family pictures of your cat every once in awhile in the group chat, and honestly I wouldn\u2019t say much either or respond lol. I\u2019m not much of an animal person and they\u2019re okay from far away but I\u2019d have no attachment or interest in someone else\u2019s pet. Sometimes ppl send me pics/vids of their pets and I just reply \u201coh cool\u201d and then try changing the subject haha. Again, I\u2019m sorry. Your cat can\u2019t compete with human children. \n\nOff topic: OMG I always see your posts in the Glee sub haha. Different seeing you here", "NTA my family lives far away too (not as far as yours but far enough that you can't just visit for a day). I grew up not really thinking about it, but now that Im older I've realised how weird it is that only a few of my aunts have visited our house. I think one aunt came by just one time and my two uncles have never visited. Which is weird because we would visit theirs.", "I don't think I'd call you an AH, but you're the one who moved so far away. Hopefully your mom will push through her issues and come one day. I personally wouldn't count on getting the sister out there for a long long time. It's very difficult to travel with young kids, and then by the time it's easier to travel with them their tickets are no longer free so then it becomes extremely expensive if you have multiple children.", "NAH. \n\nI can understand you\u2019re hurt, frustrated and disappointed.  So I can\u2019t think of you as an asshole. I want to help if I can. \n\nI\u2019m going to focus on the fact they\u2019re semi ghosting you on the communication. I think that\u2019s where any a-holing begins.  My mom\u2019s family is in Asia so I know it\u2019s with the non face to face stuff that these relationships thrive or die. Rather than focus on who is being an asshole, I think it\u2019s important to look at the underlying mechanics and fix that. I do think they\u2019re falling down on the job more than you. \n\nI am a mom of a human daughter. And a \u201cpet-mom\u201d of many cats, both mine and fosters, and in the past had dogs as well.  Both aspects of my life bring me joy of a different kind that I love to share with people who are important to me.  \n\nSo I can empathize with you feeling that you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick on the communication part of the relationship.  Your cat has been an important part of your life and you wanted to share about this part of your life. It can hurt when your cat photos and anecdotes aren\u2019t given the same weight or even any weight vs your sibling\u2019s children.  \n\nUnfortunately that happens all the time.  The natural reaction can be to kind of withdraw from being invested in the children.  I completely understand that. I would encourage you to resist that urge to withdraw, though.  \n\nFor your sister, I can remember how addled and behind all communication I got when my daughter was little. It isn\u2019t just the kids that are needy, but my goodness, the school was badgering me nonstop to volunteer.  From middle school to high school the pressure was intense and the schedule was demanding until Covid. So let\u2019s just give your sister a pass on that for now.  \n\nWhat\u2019s going on with your mom? Have you asked her why communication has fallen off between you?  She\u2019s the one I would focus my attention on right now. I\u2019m not referring to pressing her to come fly to see you. Let\u2019s do some triage and put the communication back on track first. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing or contemplating anything asshole-ish but if I were you, I\u2019d persist just a little longer and try to find out where the breaches are in your relationships and communication and address those. \n\nDo give your sister a LOT of grace.  It\u2019s hard to understand unless you\u2019re in her house seeing what she\u2019s up against for yourself. Every household is different so you can\u2019t necessarily compare what you grew up with or what you\u2019re seeing in other homes to what\u2019s happening in hers. \n\nI even thought I\u2019d have more free time and energy when my daughter went into high school, but I was so wrong. I\u2019m friends with other moms since our kids were in elementary school. They went to different schools but we moms stayed friends.  But we no longer had time to see each other because high school life and being moms to teens sucked us in. Being moms during the pandemic was a special kind of hell.  \n\nAll of us are still catching up on getting doctor\u2019s appointments and things done that couldn\u2019t be done for almost 2 years plus horrific wait times. My daughter is 18 now and still is in a queue to get evaluated for neurodivergence. That should have been completed sophomore year in high school. Which was a lost year. \n\nAnd yet she still had to go on meeting deadlines and responsibilities like nothing shut down.  \n\nOur children emerged so damaged from that period.  I don\u2019t have time or space to convey to you what that was like. Being pregnant and having a baby during that time was also hell on so many women I know.  I\u2019m not sure what your sister has been through.  My dad died a year and a few months ago during a last blast Covid surge and the hospital rules were still very restrictive. \n\nFast forward to now:  All of us are seeing our kids off to college so we\u2019re starting to plan get togethers after barely seeing each other since before the pandemic.  One of my friends just invited us to a very important event and she and I have not texted or talked in 3 years!  But we are picking up right where we left off before so much crap hit us in the face.  \n\nSo keep a figurative candle in the window for your sister. She\u2019s always going to be your sister. You haven\u2019t had a falling out so don\u2019t let there be one. \n\nIf I were you I would go to see the family.  At least find out if there really is a coldness there that\u2019s set in. Or you might find your sister beaming to see you, an actual adult!  And don\u2019t be put off if she seems a bit self absorbed regarding her life and kids.  I really do think it\u2019s a hormonal spell a lot of us moms fall under and it\u2019s probably necessary so we don\u2019t go insane and abandon these needy little monsters.  And it\u2019s probably intensified by parenting through a global pandemic and political unrest. \n\nBut don\u2019t hesitate to tell her you would appreciate some show of interest in your life whenever she can come up for air.  She may not even realize how much she\u2019s failing to nurture your relationship.  \n\nReally, go to Texas, get lots of hugs. Give lots of hugs. Accept that things can\u2019t be equal or equitable right now or anytime soon, but see if some building blocks can be set down during this visit for better communication.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if they will ever visit you in Germany. My mom\u2019s family never could manage to come to the US though they really wanted to.  (Their work life balance is way worse than what the US has and vacation leave is pathetic). Life does get in the way. But they always welcomed us when we went to see them.  \n\nI have noticed that Europeans, somehow, are generally speaking, just so much better about travel for some reason than those of us in the US.  I do have to travel such long distances to see family in the US that it does take a lot out of me that I don\u2019t have the energy to muster to take the trip to Italy I\u2019ve always dreamed of. And I\u2019ve been meaning to travel with friends to Greece for 15 years now. They can\u2019t manage it, either. \n\nFor one thing, vacation allotments in the US absolutely suck compared to what our European counterparts get. \n\nSorry this is so long. I wanted to touch on some points and see if anything at all could be of help to you. Your life and your wife sound lovely and I hope someday someone from your family gets to see you all in your home turf.", "NAH - I have also lived in a different country than all of my family for most of my adult life. For many of them, international travel is not something ingrained in their culture or lifestyle. Because I value them and want them in my life, the reality is that I will always have to travel more often, and further, to see them. It\u2019s harsh but if you\u2019re the one who moves, you usually have to try harder because you miss out on all the regular meetups that are just part of everyone else\u2019s normal lives.\n\nYour pulling back is your prerogative (hence the verdict), but you can\u2019t then be surprised that they will pick up on your distance and can\u2019t complain that your conversations are more surface level.", "NAH.\n\nOP, it is hard when you move far away from family to keep a strong bond like the people that remained behind. I have moved all over the country and can count on one hand the amount of times we've had family come to us in the past 15 years. It's mostly on us to visit them. One thing I will say is that maybe look into how much effort you are putting into interacting with your family. People that are into having grandkids are going to be much more excited to talk about their grandkids than your cat. I'm sure your cat is wonderful, but to them it may not be a big topic of conversation. \n\nThere are also other ways of keeping in touch to keep a bond that don't involve in person visits. Having a weekly or monthly video call with them might be a good way to keep yourself in their minds. And as far as flight anxiety, a domestic flight can be way less stressful for someone than flying over the ocean. Once your mom arrives, part of the trip may be overshadowed by her dreading the return flight home. Anxiety can really fuck you up.\n\nFlying with young children internationally is a big pain in the ass. Some people do it no problem, but it is a big hassle.\n\nAnd one last thing I'll add, I feel like people say a lot of things about making plans or visiting, but don't follow through. I think they have good intentions, but I truly don't believe they actually want to visit. If they did, they would. One thing you could do is to tell them how much it would mean to you if they could come visit. Other than that, I don't think there's much you can do. But I will say that withdrawing will make sure you are less involved in their lives. So go down that route carefully and make sure it's what you want the outcome to be.", "As long as you are doing this because you thing it will be better for your metal well being and not to be petty than you are in the clear. It does sound like thats the case so NTA", "NTA. The bottom line is you can do whatever you want, and if they miss you and want to come see you badly enough they will.

This way it would be more interesting than just going home for you and much more doable than international travel for your family. At the end of the day it\u2019s your family and your decision, but I feel there is some middle ground here where you can keep your relationship with your family.", "NTA, I honestly did the same with my extended family.

He didn't fly at all but he would frequently drive through my state, on a highway that was 3 hours away from my home, on his way to visit his brother. but driving the 3 hours out of his way was too time consuming and even though he only worked part-time, for himself - no boss, he simply could not spare the time it would take to meet me even half way. He, of course, expected me to visit him multiple times a year. As he got older, he said it was time and money, he couldn't take off of work (again, he worked for himself, part-time).\n\nFinally, in June 2021 he called me excited to say he was buying an new puppy but it was SOOO Expensive. He had to get a pure breed dog that cost over $2,000.\n\nI lit up at him. \"Don't even talk to me about this dog. You've never come to visit your only daughter in 10 years.

I've asked you every single time I speak to you on the phone to come see me and you always say \"one day\". Don't talk to me about this fucking dog!\"\n\nAnd for the first time, ever, he said he would come see me. We planned it for the first weekend of August. I was so excited. We started texting about what we would do, the restaurants we would go to. I was so excited to finally have my daddy with me in my house.\n\n3 weeks after that phone call he fucking died.

I was very poor back then, but I still visited her twice and had my dog with me (which meant getting him a lot of expensive vaccinations and a passport of his own). \nMy sister also visited me several times and we used to talk a lot on the phone. My monthly phone bills were quite high, as this was pre free-Internet-phoning. \n\nWhen my sister left her 1st hubby, she came back home and lived in my house for a year before getting on her feet. We continued being close until she found her 2nd SO. He is jealous of her, so my sister dropped me almost instantly. Nowadays, I only see her at Christmas, even though she lives nearby. We don't talk much on the phone anymore; it's like we never were close at all.\n\nIt took some time for me to mourn her, but I can't force anyone to keep me in their lives. I've forgiven her and went on with my life. Needles to say, I'm not investing my time and effort in getting to know her children too well now.

I think the onus is on you because you\u2019re the one asking them to change. You\u2019re the one with the new life that they also have to adjust to. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this happen with friend groups and family over the years. Everyone still cares about each other, but the life right in front of them is far more pressing. You get married, have kids, get hung up at work, you have issues with money, someone dies\u2026 and before you know it years have passed and you realize you still haven\u2019t gone to visit that friend out of state.

Speaking as someone who moved from Asia to the UK years ago, it\u2019s not easy to catch up together in one city as a family.

For mom, it\u2019s to brush off her flight anxiety - sure it\u2019s easy to take a domestic flight to see the sister but it\u2019s definitely different as compared to taking an international flight (even with stopovers it\u2019s time and mentally consuming). For the sister, she\u2019s married, has small young children to be a mother to, so how can you expect her to bring her kids to visit without any reservations/planning? \n\nAlso my parents and brother don\u2019t really do phone calls much (maybe once every other month or during each others\u2019 birthdays), but we make an effort to know about each other\u2019s days, even if it\u2019s just my dad sending \u201cold people pics (aka the good morning photos)\u201d with the occasional discussions on random topics, BUT we make the effort to stay in touch even though it\u2019s not much - sometimes we don\u2019t talk for days too. \n\nMaybe OP has too much of a high expectation (and the fam may not be a fan of cats as OP is??) on making the effort.

I dealt with too many screaming babies, vomiting kids sitting next to me, and other annoyances to the point that I refuse to be the one who forces others to go thru that. So I waited for my kids to be over 7 years old. I do not regret it at all.

Acknowledge the reality that they do face some bigger challenges to travel than you do, due to the kids and fear of flying, respectively, but that it would mean a lot to you for them to make the effort. Then, also ask what exactly would need to happen for it to feel doable for them. Does your sister feel like she could do it once her kids reach a certain age? Then set a goal and timeline for around then, and agree to keep talking about it seriously. Is your mom willing to speak with a doctor about her anxiety and maybe get some tips and possibly medication to help with it? \n\nIf they aren\u2019t willing to engage in a conversation that deals with these concrete things, then yeah, it really is your last trip, and it would be fair to start investing more in relationships that return the investment fairly.

We try to host them once a year and most of them act like it's a chore to visit us, even though we make the reverse hour drive to see them way more often. \n\nPoint is, my husband loves his family. So we accepted a long time ago that we will be the ones to travel to visit. We're talking about moving states away and know that means that none of them will probably visit.
