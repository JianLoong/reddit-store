Just the way we always wanted it\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s expensive to fly back home (Texas/Tennessee), but I\u2019ve done it twice since. The plane ticket alone for my wife and I is up to 1,000\u20ac *each.* Not to mention the cost of a hotel (something we choose for ourselves to have space), food, other misc. expenses. \n\nMy sister doesn\u2019t work (SAHM) and had a baby in 2018 and we went to Texas to visit for two weeks. It was great because I became an aunt for the first time and got to see my sister who I hadn\u2019t seen in several years at this point. My mom also flew in during this time from Tennessee. \n\nI have always begged my sister or my mom to come visit me in Europe. I want to show them the life I\u2019ve made for myself here, teach/show them the culture, and admittedly, just feel the excitement of having them travel to see me. They\u2019ve always said things like, \u201cone day it\u2019ll happen.\u201d \n\nMy sister\u2019s excuse has always been that she has a young kid and can\u2019t just make spontaneous plans and travel. My mom\u2019s excuse is that she can\u2019t handle an international flight. She does have flight anxiety, but somehow she manages the 2-3 flights to Texas a few times a year. (Keep in mind my sister didn\u2019t have a baby the first few years I lived here.)\n\n2023 comes and my sister had her second child in June. At this point, I doubt she will ever visit. My mom already made her yearly trip to Texas and could seemingly care less about what\u2019s going on in my life. I\u2019ve been here 8 years and my mother doesn\u2019t even own a passport. I\u2019ve even encouraged her to get one at my own cost in the case of an emergency. She\u2019s just not interested. My sister and her husband do have passports. \n\nI\u2019ve pulled back from my family because of this. It was planned that we fly to Texas next year to meet my second niece, but I\u2019ve canceled that trip. I\u2019m tired of the effort being one-sided. It\u2019s also incredibly expensive. Mostly my heart isn\u2019t into it anymore because it honestly feels like I\u2019ve been put on the back burner. \n\nThe only time we really chat now is when it\u2019s about my sister\u2019s kids. Our family chat is nothing else but conversation about my sister\u2019s family. I throw a pic of my cat in there every now and then and the engagement is the bare minimum of a virtual heart. \n\nMy phone doesn\u2019t ring as much anymore. My private texts go unanswered most times or the replies I do get seem mundane. I\u2019ve stopped initiating communication from my end because what\u2019s the point? \n\nMy wife thinks I need to approach it differently because I\u2019m being a little selfish and unfair.

I moved to Europe from New York 12 years ago. I built my life here. It was a real struggle to keep in contact with my siblings. It always felt like a one-way street to me. Sometimes I just wouldn't reach out and see how long it would take for somebody to message me. \n\nAbout four or five years in, I had some heart to heart talks with my sisters. Since then we have grown our relationship to be  incredibly close. \n\nIt's fairly common that the person who chooses the uncommon path in their life has to do more to reach out to maintain those relationships. It's not right, it's just reality. Subconsciously they may just feel like you are the one who created the situation of it being such a pain to visit, so it should be you to reach out. \n\nWhen I stopped caring about how often somebody reached out to me, and just evaluated the relationship. And was it something that I wanted to nurture I let go of a lot of that resentment.\n\nIt's fair to feel hurt. It's fair to feel frustrated. But the way you wrote this letter, it doesn't seem like you want to sever ties with your family. Sometimes being the bigger person is rewarding to yourself even more than it is to the other people who supposedly benefit from the imbalance in the relationship.", "NAH, but you're heading into asshole territory now by *purposely* taking action to degrade your relationships. \n\nRealize, your family may think the onus is on you to maintain physical contact since you made the choice to permanently move abroad. If you live near your in-laws then that could be another element that makes your old family feel \"less than\" and disinterested in visiting.\n\nYou said in a comment you have discussed visits \"playfully.\"  Quit playing games about it and really have a talk about this if you expect anything to change.

This way you get both the vacation you enjoy and see family members.", "It's really difficult to get some Americans out of the USA. I bet they don't even have passports. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nI think your family is being selfish and unfair, not you. If your family wanted to come see you, they would have figured it out. Your sister and the husband could have visited before extending their family. Your BIL could have taken vacation time to watch their kid, so your sister could come to see you. \n\nYour mom could suck it up and come to visit you. Not liking international flights isn't an excuse.\n\nAnd their decreasing communication over your cancelled trip is really telling.\n\nIt is your choice to not return home.", "NTA who doesn't want to go to Europe?? That's crazy. You and your wife and cat just keep living your best life and enjoying all the fabulousness you get to see daily.", "Nta for feeling how you do. Your feelings are valid and it's clear your feelings aren't the priority. People grow apart. It's sad and it sucks but you can't do anything to change it. It's your choice if you chose to see them or not. I don't think you're an ah for canceling the trip but I do think you aren't being vocal enough about your wants and needs here. Validation from strangers is fine but what you're seeking here is validation from your kin, please talk to your mom and sister if you still want a relationship with them in the future.", "NTA went through the same thing with my sister and her wife - I used to call, visit, etc...it was all one-sided.  So I stopped - figured if they were that interested, they could call and they didn't. If they can't be bothered why should you?", "Write them on the family chat hey family I\u2019m now putting as much effort into our relationships as you do I\u2019m done been the one to visit I\u2019m done been the one ignored you have made it clear that I\u2019m out of sight therefore out of mind and your lack of effort to ever visit over the 8 years has hurt me and continues to hurt \n\nGo on holiday with your wife enjoy your life. Your family is clearly stealing a lot of your happiness and your allowing it to continue.  Your been an ass to yourself", "NTA, if that's your prerogative .\n\nBut I never understood really why people care and depend so much on seldom or solitary visits as a way to keep close to family. As a benchmark for closeness. Even if your family visited you once or twice a year, it's still just a visit. I can understand if they hadn't been at all, and you want them to see the life that you're proud of. \n\nBut everything they are seeing, is in this false bubble of showing. Like animal exhibits in the zoo. It never made me feel closer to anybody. I would rather have more regular communication with them. If that's the trade-off. Give me a midweek conversation, with them talking about the office villain or how They had the 'worst' day ever, over a visit where everyone is acting a touch unnaturally.", "NTA: Would it be possible for a compromise where you book a holiday to somewhere more usually regarded as a holiday spot from Europe - Cancun/Florida? and see if your family would deign to join you. If they can't manage that you & your wife still get a decent holiday", "\nI'm almost the opposite of you.  I moved from Europe to the US as a kid. My relatives back home refuse to visit bc they're terrified of Americsn cities being dangerous war zones and refuse to believe I live in a very nice, very safe place.  \n\nI don't want to make any unkind assumptions about TX/TN, but is it possible your family has some fears/notions about where you live? I know my in laws refused a free trip to Paris last year bc they think evil union workers are burning the ciry down and killing everyone.  When we sent them pics of us picnicking next to the Seine, they accused us of lying about being in Paris.  The eiffel tower was in the background of our picture....\n\nHave your family members ever traveled abroad before? It might just be a fear thing. Or maybe a money thing. But, tbh, it's most likely that your mom wants to see her grandkids more than you and your sister doesn't want to be on a plane for 10 hours with small kids.  \n\nIt sucks to be the family member who puts in all the work to maintain relationships.  But, it also sucks to talk to someone who is bitter that I don't have time for them.  \n\nI'm sorry for your situation.  You're NTA. Probably no one is.", "NTA", "NTA", "Planes go both ways and if your heart\u2019s not in it, it\u2019s not in it. NTA.

Relationships need to be reciprocal, otherwise they tend to fizzle out as it's too much effort for one person to do all the work.

I think it\u2019s perfectly fair to be upset with them for not making an effort to stay in touch with you. If the pandemic taught us anything, it\u2019s that it possible to maintain relationships from a distance. However I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold it against them that they\u2019re not coming to visit you. Regarding your mom, you admit she has flight anxiety. It\u2019s easy to push through that for a quick domestic flight, like from Tennessee to Texas but international travel is a completely different beast. It\u2019s stressful and uncomfortable so if someone already has anxiety about flying, an international flight is going to be out of the question. As for your sister, she and her husband have a single income household. It\u2019s not reasonable to be upset with her for not wanting to spend money to go to Europe. She and her husband may not even have the money to go. \n\nI would talk your family about not expressing interest in your life but I think you should drop the travel issue.

I wrote it down for myself to read when I feel down about all of this. Thank you.", "My sister didn\u2019t work before the kids came along. Trust me, money is not an issue for my sister and her family. Her husband works hard and has given her a great life. They could easily afford a trip to Europe.\n\nAs far as my mom having flight anxiety, she can somehow handle 4-5 flights to Texas, but not a 6 hour flight to London with a break before continuing on?", "Yes, I moved to Germany to be with my wife. Her family lives about an hour away. We visit them several times throughout the year.", "You didn\u2019t make the decision to move continent with them, you decided to move because it suited you and one of the consequences is that it\u2019s going to be difficult for others to visit you. I have family abroad who have never visited, even though they physically could, for various reasons. It sucks but it is part of being the one that moved.\n\nAlso, 2 trips in 6 years (discounting 2 covid years) isn\u2019t actually a lot. \n\nAlso one last thing about your mum, I\u2019ve seen here (in other families) one member of the family will fly out to accompany their parent on their flight to visit (so the family member flies out and then back in with their parent). I am guessing you wouldn\u2019t want to do that but I\u2019ve seen it work well.", "Np.\n\nSide note.  My husband and I are going to start visiting Europe this year, as a result in part of everything I mentioned. \n\nThis year is Rome, any suggestions for next year?", "I think you\u2019re an AH for dismissing her travel anxiety.  A 2-3 hour direct flight in the US with no language barriers is very very different than a long flight over the ocean that involves navigating new airports where you don\u2019t speak the language.  \n\nI know plenty of people who are fine travelers who would be hesitant to travel internationally alone.", "If they can easily afford it, how many international trips have they taken since becoming parents? Come on, if he works hard at his job and she works hard at home taking care of the kids, they would most likely jump at the opportunity to travel to Europe for a week, if they had the money to do it. Also, a trip from Tennessee to Germany is completely different from a trip from Tennessee to Texas. It\u2019s not a fair comparison at all. \n\nI\u2019m beginning to see why your wife says you\u2019re being selfish and unfair. You were living in Europe for three years before you went to visit your family and you only did that because your sister had a baby. You were only planning this upcoming visit  because your sister had another baby. Ask yourself this question: if your sister didn\u2019t have kids how many times would you have traveled to visit your family in the last six years?", "Right.  So from your old family's perspective:\n\n*You* chose to make a life abroad with your spouse and *her* family, which is perfectly fine and what often happens in life. But your mother/sister may have felt then that their own priority in your life was clear, and their behavior reflects that now. Surely you realized at the time that your decision came with trade-offs. \n\nYour wife is likely discouraging you from cancelling the trip because she realizes that she was the reason for the physical distance, and she doesn't want to also be the cause of a real estrangement.\n\nIt's still possible to maintain and even improve these relationships, even with no physical visits.  That's your call.", "My favorite city in Europe is Liverpool. I can\u2019t get enough. I\u2019ll recommend it every single time.", "I second this. Real AH move to dismiss her mom\u2019s anxieties and make it seem like going from TN to TX multiple times is the same as going to a whole other side of the world that is very different than possibly anything she\u2019s ever experienced", "We live in an English speaking country. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not dismissing her travel anxiety at all. She has agreed that she wants to visit. She just isn\u2019t executing it.", "We are definitely going to the UK. A co-worker of mine is from Maryport, and highly suggests visiting the UK", "I thought you said you live in Germany?   You\u2019re dismissing it by repeating that she can fly to Texas.  You\u2019re not acknowledging that an international flight is much different.\n\nCustoms is overwhelming for a lot of people, even those without travel anxiety!"]}
