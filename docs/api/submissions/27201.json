This past Friday I had pre-planned to take off so I could enjoy a day. My wife worked from home, but I ended up staying home taking care of of son again. She gave me 30 minutes of her time to watch our kid so I could go get a haircut.\nSaturday morning she decided to go get vaccinated (covid / flu) and stayed on the couch ignoring everyone again, claiming the vaccine wore her out.\nSunday morning after breakfast and the kids were distracted I tried talking to her to let her know I didn't feel acknowledged or appreciated for taking up the extra slack for 2 weeks in a row. She shut down the conversation telling me, \"congrats on being a parent\" and walked away.\n\nAITA for wanting to talk about not feeling valued?\n\n\nEdit - since there are multiple comments about thr breakdown of work:\nOn weekdays she will help get the kids dressed in the morning for school. I cook breakfast for them, drop them off at school, pick them up from school, make dinner & entertain them until wife gets home. I empty dishwasher/ refill or hand clean things that need to be cleaned. We normally alternate who puts which kid to bed.\n\nWeekend meals will vary based on her mood.\n\nWeekends I am usually entertaining the kids if we stay home (she's usually glued to TV or tablet but will help manage kids when they act out). When youngest is napping, I'll mow the lawn or work on other house projects. She normally handles laundry, but I do the folding/putaway for me & kids.\n\nEdit 2:\nI clean all the bathrooms except hers (we have young boys with bad aim). I vacuum the carpet on the weekend. We have a robot that does the hardwood floor daily. Neither of us mop since we have hardwood floors.

How much longer will you be picking up her slack? How did you frame this complaint? \n\nAlso, it's kinda shitty to act like the COVID vaccine didn't actually knock her on her butt. It definitely does affect people that way, and it sounds like you just wanted another thing to complain about.", "INFO: You said you did everything for two weeks, but only talked about a handful of days where you seemed to have to do more than usual. What does the division of housework/childcare usually look like? Does your wife pick up your slack as needed, and then expect things in return?

Y'all need therapy; an AITA ruling isn't going to do anything to help the situation which would be more aptly described as festering resentment in a longterm relationship, than a single conflict.\n\n---\n\nSo your wife has been super busy for 2 weeks and you\u2019ve been picking up the slack around the house? \n\nAnd why are you implying that she\u2019s faking exhaustion after getting vaccines (I literally plan to take the rest of the day and following day off work when I get mine because I feel so run down,) or that taking care of your children while she\u2019s working (from home) is anything to remark on? \n\nI do think couples should appreciate each other and vocalize it when they feel overlooked, but still, Y T A because your attitude is pretty shitty and wanting accolades for doing most of the chores for 2 weeks is a bit much.", "NTA because duh. The question is, \"Am I an \\*asshole\\* for commenting that I do not feel appreciated.\" That's it, that's all. The question isn't, \"who deserves a break\" or \"who has justified their part of the partnership.\" \n\nSo, is it not only wrong but \\*at least a little offensive\\* to verbally express that you'd like more appreciation than you got? No, that's not being an asshole. There was no accusations. No yelling. No throwing things. You initiated a conversation. You didn't belittle her. You didn't accuse her of not holding up her end of the bargain (that was slightly implied in your story, but not what you recounted saying to the wife). \n\nCome on people. When you overhear a person tell another person \"I haven't felt appreciated the past couple weeks while you've been overwhelmed at work\", do you really think \"OMG what an asshole.\" No, you don't because we \\*all\\* feel that way occasionally. IT'S NOT A COMPETITION. Sure, they're both working hard but they both can support each other. Dude asked for \"appreciation\" which for many men can easily be a nice word and a few seconds of whatever touch the dude appreciates. All the YTA votes are saying that something like that is not only wrong to expect ... it's offensive? \n\nAll the YTA voters, how do you react to those campaigns about men's mental health? You know, the ones that encourage men to reach out to their immediate family and friends with how they are feeling. You say, \"feelings are all well and good, but really you've got to ensure that you've objectively and obviously earned any positive feelings coming your way - if you ask for appreciation when you aren't obviously working harder, then that's just offensive.\"", "I feel the comments here are missing the point.

Feeling appreciated doesn\u2019t mean you want constant praise, if the shoe was on the other foot everyone would be saying you need to pull your finger out but cos it\u2019s the mom who is essentially neglecting family life it\u2019s ok cos she needs to have time out. The double standards on Reddit are laughable at times", "NTA.\n\nYou are picking up slack to support your wife, and she isn\u2019t speaking your love language which will seed resentment.\n\nNext time you will be less willing to do so and then she will feel some resentment.\n\nWeather or not she thinks is a big deal or not isnt the issue, it\u2019s an issue to you.  She could have validated your feelings instead of brushing you off.\n\nDespite what others say you totally deserve to be validated and thanked for being a good dad.\n\nWhatever her issues are it doesn\u2019t give her a pass to be cranky and cold hearted.", "Sounds like you have a good division of labor on normal days\u2026NTA for wanting to feel a bit appreciated as I would like the same in reverse position.

And it seems like you handle a majority of the chores. I don't even have kids but people are messy and it takes a lot of work to keep a home clean. Asking for words of affirmation or please and thank you isn't a bad thing. I had to teach my partner to say please and thank you when asking me to do things since his mother never taught him to do so and his (ex)stepdad clearly walks all over his mother. It amazes me sometimes how little it's taught to respect and appreciate the other people in our lives. I forget from time to time, so no one is perfect but the point is to always make an effort. I'm sorry she isn't, and hopefully you can build communication up to help fix the issues.", "NTA, and it's kind of funny how she's passively aggressively saying congrats on being a parent when she very obviously is failing to do that exact job.", "NTA. My husband and I always make sure we thank each other for doing our regular everyday jobs and parenting. While we know the work is expected of us we still want to make sure the other always knows they are appreciated and valued and not being taken for granted.

Your wife has been the one doing this already. It's clear from her reaction that she does not get acknowledged or recognized for it. Nor should it be, this is your job to be doing aswell. Two weeks is barely even cutting it. You guys both need to figure something out, but don't be expecting some kind of reward for doing something a parent should be doing.", "Looking at your (attempted) post history, it\u2019s likely past time you seek some marital counseling.  There is a lot more at play here than your last 2 weeks of overtime.", "NTA BUT that doesn't mean your wife is an asshole either.\n\nAlso, if the roles were reversed I can't imagine there would be as many \"YTA\" either, but I could be wrong about that and only have my own experience to go off of.", "NTA. I could be glib and say something like \u201cI guess it turns out you actually have 3 kids\u201d but more realistically, she probably is just overburdened from work. I don\u2019t know what the heck she could possibly do that requires two entire weeks to \u201ccatch up\u201d on, but it sounds like it\u2019s probably stressful? \n\nHowever, as it seems neither of you in a SAHP role, her career doesn\u2019t excuse her from her share of parenting and housekeeping responsibilities.", "YTA. Wow... A whole two weeks being a dad and husband and you expect bells and whistles? Grow up.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what, I always thank anyone who is doing more of the work than usual. It\u2019s just kind. Your wife is not being kind, in fact, she is down right rude. People want to hate because they always assume the woman does more of the work, but given your comments so far, it seems you do a lot on a regular basis anyways. Being stressed at work is no excuse for your wife to act that way. She could have easily said \u201cI know I have been MIA the last couple of weeks, but I do really appreciate you picking up the slack while I worked on xxx\u201d. So, your wife is the AH in this situation.", "How many times have you told her that she's appreciated?", "YTA! You don't get extra credit for being the dad you're supposed to be.

Well, just stop the goddamn presses.  WTF is wrong with you dude. Two weeks out of 15 years and you want some damn trophy? You are giving fathers a bad name with your childish need for reinforcement. You are a parent, parenting is hard.

I have an awesome team!", "You told OP, who only asked to discuss his feelings, to give his wife more grace (implying his feelings were in fact not giving her grace), and then went after him for saying anything about her vaccine. Getting a vaccine does not render you immobile. You didn\u2019t render a judgment but you certainly were being judgmental.", "Made the awful mistake of flying within days of my vaccine.  Could barely function and was lucky to make it to the hotel alive.", "Some people will be OK though. I got my COVID and flu vaccine at the same time and I felt just fine. Continued on with my day/week.", "Yeah. The flu shot is hit or miss when it comes to me feeling fine afterwards. Usually it is not sick, just blah. But after seeing what the flu is really like, I get the flu shot every year. I haven\u2019t gotten it since.", "Suggesting therapy doesn\u2019t invalidate feelings. AITA is simply not the right forum for complex relationship problems.", "Yes, more people need to understand this.", "I feel for people in these situations, it's rough when your in a relationship/marriage and you don't recieve some words of encouragement when you've done something well.", "A lot of people, especially young people just suck at being in relationships.", "Ahhh the AITA mindset", "I hope not, if they are I feel bad for their partners", "From her response? Women typically don\u2019t respond like that unless that\u2019s the case, but men will without that connotation", "Sounds like a guy who wants to know his wife appreciates him. \n\nBrownie points is sucking up to someone. He wants to be seen and acknowledged. It\u2019s amazing that you see those as the same thing - you must have an interesting social circle.", "Sounds like a good opportunity to communicate instead of being an asshole.", "\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, man, but do you genuinely believe there\u2019s a chance he\u2019d say \u201cI do it for praise and I didn\u2019t get any\u201d?\n\nI don\u2019t mean to misunderstand your intent but like\u2026 you asked a question that would only ever get one answer. You\u2019re telling me you\u2019d believe him if he gave that answer?", "Because catching up on missed/incompleted work assignments is not praiseworthy even if it results in working extra hours\u2026 catching up is meeting expectations, not exceeding them.\n\nETA: on top of that, unless they were on the brink of homelessness and she HAD to work those extra hours, then there\u2019s nothing for him to appreciate about her working more. Her working more is making his life more difficult, hence the post, so why would he thank her for it?", "I mean yeah in this case it literally is belittling, you can't use your mind's eye to imagine how that phrase was said, given the context? Really? It's textbook belittling", "He did clarify it though. Maybe it was someone else, but they stopped a back and forth conversation with him when it was clear he wasn\u2019t the asshole. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call him an asshole (or anyone for that matter) for expressing feelings\u2026", "Am I the only one concerned that there\u2019s no mopping happening on the hardwood floors?", "thats a lot of assumptions lol", "Source: your ass", "Lmao\u2026no \n\nIt\u2019s just *usually* how womens\u2019 brains work. My husband is very involved and does so much for our daughter and the home. It\u2019s not an insult to a man/father, it\u2019s just a difference in how we think about running the household and caring for our family.\n\nEdit to add: look up mom guilt. It\u2019s a huge factor in the mental load that fathers don\u2019t usually experience.", "Right?!?! When my family members got theirs vaccines they were totally fine! Me- I had a fever and body aches and was so tired for 24-48 hrs each time! It sucks! Everyone reacts differently. How does this dude not get it?!", "Perfectly fine. How bout you? Do you feel love and appreciation from your significant other? Because of course you understand those are basics in any healthy relationship.", "This sub is just sexist and that\u2019s honestly all there is to it, every single judgement and comment this place usually makes is explained by this", "It actually is? Unless you\u2019re making something in the oven it\u2019s pretty negligent to leave a hot stove. You might be able to clean up the kitchen here and there while you\u2019re in the room, but no serious house cleaning can get done while you\u2019re cooking. \nThat\u2019s how you burn down a house or a kid comes in a pulls a hot pan off the stove.", "It\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t count. More like when you start a conversation with an aggressive tone you\u2019re more likely to put the other person on the defensive then get the thing you\u2019re looking for.", "Yeah, sure, don\u2019t disagree. \n\nIt\u2019s his attitude that\u2019s putting off so many", "Thanks for laying that ridiculous bias out in the open for everyone", "Wow\u2026", "What are you basing this on?", "Or maybe she\u2019s just an asshole?\n\nNo, she\u2019s a woman, that can\u2019t be\u2026\n\n/s", "Her response is the equivalent of a \u201cfirst time here\u201d meme and he\u2019s taking it as disrespect. Seems like he\u2019s omitting a lot too, that doesn\u2019t say \u201cguy who wants his wife to appreciate him\u201d to me at all", "Again I think your misunderstanding what I said originally. Does the husband go out of his way to praise his wife? Guessing no BC OF HER RESPONSE. Im sure she\u2019s had to pick up slack before in the relationship w so many kids bc that\u2019s what relationships are like, so why is it crazy to think that this is yet again another story about how the husband is doing house work but is expecting way more praise than he would have ever given his wife for the exact same chores. Just bc he didn\u2019t say all of that doesn\u2019t mean her response isnt warranted and she\u2019s just a bitch. Context is important and everyone is saying I\u2019m being sexist for picking up on this just bc they can\u2019t wtf. If y\u2019all in this thread are miserable but treat the ppl in your life like the commenters up here have been responding to me, seems like there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re miserable and it\u2019s miscommunication and hoobastank (the reason is you)", "He didn\u2019t comment to me. My comment was off the information he first posted- there were only a few comments at that time. He didn\u2019t speak highly of her, but did not offer more info at that time. I\u2019m not monitoring his conversations. He asked a question to the public forum, it was answered based on the original information he gave. His edits were not there\u2026 hence the YTA reactions.", "Hahaha, I thought the same! In another comment, he said he uses like a swiffer or something but doesn't consider that mopping. Mopping apparently needs to include a pail and water.", "This sub thrives on assumptions. It's wild.", "They were *questions*.  OP is welcome to answer them.", "Well, you don\u2019t have to use the front burners. Washing dishes after you done using them isn\u2019t hard to do. \n\nI don\u2019t stand in front of the stove the entire time I am cooking if I am making chili, soup, pasta sauce, steaming veggies, taco meat, etc etc. Plus you have to be watching the kids and know what they are up to (he is making dinner and watching the kids). \n\nHis kids are old enough to be putting stuff away after they are done playing with it.", "Her response.", "Her response.", "Sounds like you have never been in an adult relationship.", "Makes sense. I usually wait for the inevitable edits before I render judgment, but I understand what you\u2019re saying.", "No you said \u201cwomen don\u2019t typically respond that way\u201d unless they aren\u2019t also being under appreciated, but men for some reason do\n\nBased on what? What\u2019s to say she just didn\u2019t respond well?", "Oh so you\u2019re sexist?  Gotcha.\n\nSo we shouldn\u2019t really put credence into your opinion then.", "Am currently and have been happily for a very long time. Not sure what that has to do w anything", "I definitely caught this one early! So it looks like misandry over here, when it\u2019s not. \n\nBut from his post history\u2026 they absolutely have larger issues to work out. Their marriage isn\u2019t a healthy one!", "Yes, she said \u201ccongrats on being a parent\u201d which is something a woman would say in that context. That response wouldn\u2019t come from someone who got all kinds of compliments and affirmation from their partner but now he wants it bc he had to pick up slack for a couple measly weeks? Gtfoh op lol", "How tf is that sexist? Unless you\u2019re just misunderstanding me like that other person who deleted their comments"]}
