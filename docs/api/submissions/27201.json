This past Friday I had pre-planned to take off so I could enjoy a day. My wife worked from home, but I ended up staying home taking care of of son again. She gave me 30 minutes of her time to watch our kid so I could go get a haircut.\nSaturday morning she decided to go get vaccinated (covid / flu) and stayed on the couch ignoring everyone again, claiming the vaccine wore her out.\nSunday morning after breakfast and the kids were distracted I tried talking to her to let her know I didn't feel acknowledged or appreciated for taking up the extra slack for 2 weeks in a row. She shut down the conversation telling me, \"congrats on being a parent\" and walked away.\n\nAITA for wanting to talk about not feeling valued?\n\n\nEdit - since there are multiple comments about thr breakdown of work:\nOn weekdays she will help get the kids dressed in the morning for school. I cook breakfast for them, drop them off at school, pick them up from school, make dinner & entertain them until wife gets home. I empty dishwasher/ refill or hand clean things that need to be cleaned. We normally alternate who puts which kid to bed.\n\nWeekend meals will vary based on her mood.\n\nWeekends I am usually entertaining the kids if we stay home (she's usually glued to TV or tablet but will help manage kids when they act out). When youngest is napping, I'll mow the lawn or work on other house projects. She normally handles laundry, but I do the folding/putaway for me & kids.\n\nEdit 2:\nI clean all the bathrooms except hers (we have young boys with bad aim). I vacuum the carpet on the weekend. We have a robot that does the hardwood floor daily. Neither of us mop since we have hardwood floors.

How much longer will you be picking up her slack? How did you frame this complaint? \n\nAlso, it's kinda shitty to act like the COVID vaccine didn't actually knock her on her butt. It definitely does affect people that way, and it sounds like you just wanted another thing to complain about.", "INFO: You said you did everything for two weeks, but only talked about a handful of days where you seemed to have to do more than usual. What does the division of housework/childcare usually look like? Does your wife pick up your slack as needed, and then expect things in return? What exactly did you want from your wife?", "That\u2019s what being a parent and married is, you pick up the slack. Sometimes it\u2019s more on you, sometimes it\u2019s more on your spouse.", "So your wife has been super busy for 2 weeks and you\u2019ve been picking up the slack around the house? \n\nAnd why are you implying that she\u2019s faking exhaustion after getting vaccines (I literally plan to take the rest of the day and following day off work when I get mine because I feel so run down,) or that taking care of your children while she\u2019s working (from home) is anything to remark on? \n\nI do think couples should appreciate each other and vocalize it when they feel overlooked, but still, YTA because your attitude is pretty shitty and wanting accolades for doing most of the chores for 2 weeks is a bit much.", "NTA because duh. The question is, \"Am I an \\*asshole\\* for commenting that I do not feel appreciated.\" That's it, that's all. The question isn't, \"who deserves a break\" or \"who has justified their part of the partnership.\" \n\nSo, is it not only wrong but \\*at least a little offensive\\* to verbally express that you'd like more appreciation than you got? No, that's not being an asshole. There was no accusations. No yelling. No throwing things. You initiated a conversation. You didn't belittle her. You didn't accuse her of not holding up her end of the bargain (that was slightly implied in your story, but not what you recounted saying to the wife). \n\nCome on people. When you overhear a person tell another person \"I haven't felt appreciated the past couple weeks while you've been overwhelmed at work\", do you really think \"OMG what an asshole.\" No, you don't because we \\*all\\* feel that way occasionally. IT'S NOT A COMPETITION. Sure, they're both working hard but they both can support each other. Dude asked for \"appreciation\" which for many men can easily be a nice word and a few seconds of whatever touch the dude appreciates. All the YTA votes are saying that something like that is not only wrong to expect ... it's offensive? \n\nAll the YTA voters, how do you react to those campaigns about men's mental health? You know, the ones that encourage men to reach out to their immediate family and friends with how they are feeling. You say, \"feelings are all well and good, but really you've got to ensure that you've objectively and obviously earned any positive feelings coming your way - if you ask for appreciation when you aren't obviously working harder, then that's just offensive.\"", "I feel the comments here are missing the point.

He was looking for his wife to say something along the lines of \"Babe thank you for stepping up and looking after the kids while I caught up on work. I appreciate it.\"\n\nVery simple shit\n\nNTA there is nothing wrong with looking for some appreciation and validation, we all need it sometimes", "INFO:\n\n>The past 2 weeks I have taken on doing all the chores around the house\n\nDoes this mean she is usually responsible for these things?", "NTA, I think all those saying you are are missing the point. Feeling appreciated doesn\u2019t mean you want constant praise, if the shoe was on the other foot everyone would be saying you need to pull your finger out but cos it\u2019s the mom who is essentially neglecting family life it\u2019s ok cos she needs to have time out. The double standards on Reddit are laughable at times", "NTA.\n\nYou are picking up slack to support your wife, and she isn\u2019t speaking your love language which will seed resentment.\n\nNext time you will be less willing to do so and then she will feel some resentment.\n\nWeather or not she thinks is a big deal or not isnt the issue, it\u2019s an issue to you.  She could have validated your feelings instead of brushing you off.\n\nDespite what others say you totally deserve to be validated and thanked for being a good dad.\n\nWhatever her issues are it doesn\u2019t give her a pass to be cranky and cold hearted.", "Sounds like you have a good division of labor on normal days\u2026NTA for wanting to feel a bit appreciated as I would like the same in reverse position.

Is this an unusual attitude from her or very out of character?", "NTA for wanting to talk to her about this. It seems like a tough couple weeks for both of you.", "info: what about the last two weeks has she not done? how do you normally thank each other for the work you take on ?", "NTA.\n\nIt seems like she's beginning to check out, which isn't great. And it seems like you handle a majority of the chores. I don't even have kids but people are messy and it takes a lot of work to keep a home clean. Asking for words of affirmation or please and thank you isn't a bad thing. I had to teach my partner to say please and thank you when asking me to do things since his mother never taught him to do so and his (ex)stepdad clearly walks all over his mother. It amazes me sometimes how little it's taught to respect and appreciate the other people in our lives. I forget from time to time, so no one is perfect but the point is to always make an effort. I'm sorry she isn't, and hopefully you can build communication up to help fix the issues.", "NTA, and it's kind of funny how she's passively aggressively saying congrats on being a parent when she very obviously is failing to do that exact job.", "NTA. My husband and I always make sure we thank each other for doing our regular everyday jobs and parenting. While we know the work is expected of us we still want to make sure the other always knows they are appreciated and valued and not being taken for granted.

Your wife has been the one doing this already. It's clear from her reaction that she does not get acknowledged or recognized for it. Nor should it be, this is your job to be doing aswell. Two weeks is barely even cutting it. You guys both need to figure something out, but don't be expecting some kind of reward for doing something a parent should be doing.", "Looking at your (attempted) post history, it\u2019s likely past time you seek some marital counseling.  There is a lot more at play here than your last 2 weeks of overtime.", "NTA BUT that doesn't mean your wife is an asshole either.\n\nAlso, if the roles were reversed I can't imagine there would be as many \"YTA\" either, but I could be wrong about that and only have my own experience to go off of.", "NTA. I could be glib and say something like \u201cI guess it turns out you actually have 3 kids\u201d but more realistically, she probably is just overburdened from work. I don\u2019t know what the heck she could possibly do that requires two entire weeks to \u201ccatch up\u201d on, but it sounds like it\u2019s probably stressful? \n\nHowever, as it seems neither of you in a SAHP role, her career doesn\u2019t excuse her from her share of parenting and housekeeping responsibilities.", "YTA. Wow... A whole two weeks being a dad and husband and you expect bells and whistles? Grow up.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter what, I always thank anyone who is doing more of the work than usual. It\u2019s just kind. Your wife is not being kind, in fact, she is down right rude. People want to hate because they always assume the woman does more of the work, but given your comments so far, it seems you do a lot on a regular basis anyways. Being stressed at work is no excuse for your wife to act that way. She could have easily said \u201cI know I have been MIA the last couple of weeks, but I do really appreciate you picking up the slack while I worked on xxx\u201d. So, your wife is the AH in this situation.", "How many times have you told her that she's appreciated?", "YTA! You don't get extra credit for being the dad you're supposed to be. You also don't get extra credit or points for being a decent husband to your working wife who gave you two sons.

Well, just stop the goddamn presses.  WTF is wrong with you dude. Two weeks out of 15 years and you want some damn trophy? You are giving fathers a bad name with your childish need for reinforcement. You are a parent, parenting is hard.

Just some basic appreciation, for taking over for her so she could focus on work and get ahead/catch up", "You act like picking up the slack when one parent is busy is an easy thing and not something that should be appreciated and thanks.\n\nI feel bad for your partner if you truly believe the above.", "Right \ud83d\ude44 good job doing what needs to be done\u2026.", "looking after your own kids INDEPENDENTLY when you are used to doing it as an EQUAL PARTNER is worth some appreciation. obviously, tons of single parents do everything by themselves, all the time, and don't get appreciation for it. however, a partner who is used to an equal split of household chore & parenting duties, should get at least a small thanks for shouldering the majority of these duties while the other partner focuses on work. no parent should be praised for stepping up in their own responsibilities as a parent. imo, a partner does deserve some thanks for stepping up in the other's stead.", "So with the update, I would definitely say NTA. You do a lot for the family, and while I'm sure you don't expected to be thanked at every given opportunity, it would be nice for your wife to acknowledge.", "In the update you don't mention cleaning. And I say that because dishes and laundry are not cleaning. \n\nWho cleans the bathrooms, vacuums, mops and how often?", "But is it reciprocated?", "And they are downvoting OP for correcting the assumption.", "That\u2019s 95% of this sub.", "Lol right! They made up a whole ass story to berate Op with, they have no fucking clue.", "Uh, OP is a man, that\u2019s all the evidence needed. \n\n/s", "Going by the chore distribution you detailed in your other comment, 'split' is being very generous to her, IMO. Sounds like you absolutely do more on a regular basis, even when she's not slammed at work", "I always find these kinds of posts tricky. Essentially it sounds like you feel like your wife has checked out at home for the past couple of weeks and she feels you want to be thanked for parenting your own children. Either way as parents you guys probably need to have a conversation regarding expectations and a game plan for how you split responsibilities. It also wouldn\u2019t hurt you to check in with your wife and make sure she\u2019s ok and not struggling with depression or something", "No, you made up an entire story based on your interpretations of the reactions of someone you don\u2019t know described by someone else.\n\nAlso, only assholes don\u2019t say simple please and thank yous to their partners.", "Her reaction doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s the one doing the lions share of chores. She could also just be an asshole.", "You should try to go on your own, it would benefit you.  She seems to be checking out, for whatever reasons.  You seem to have growing resentment of that.  That won\u2019t be sustainable.", "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/HMhwsvrAY0", "It's bizarre that people think you're unreasonable for this. I don't even have kids but I picked up way more housework/chores for a few weeks when my boyfriend was working all the time. He thanked me for all the extra effort nearly every day and then we went back to normal. It's just respectful to acknowledge it.", "What did you do for your wife when she picked up your slack in the past?", "Once again grateful to my own spouse for understanding no thanks needed", "If you are complaining about being not being appreciated after having to do the lions share for two weeks, then clearly your wife does does it.  And you even complained about her being wiped after a COVID shot.  Man, that was ridiculous.", "He \"entertains\" the kids after work. How much you wanna bet that he and the kids make a huge mess every day that his wife cleans up?", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.  There is no sentence stating, I regularly let my wife know how much I appreciate her.", "I clean all the bathrooms except hers (we have young boys with bad aim). I vacuum the carpet on the weekend. We have a robot that does the hardwood floor daily. Neither of us mop since we have hardwood floors. I'm also in charge of getting the trash / recycling handled.", "If it's not, then that's a separate issue, but of course OP would be TA in that situation", "Of course they are. He's a man on Aita, arguing against the commonly held women do all chores bias. I didn't expect any different.", "He doesn't mention nearly any cleaning-related chores. I wonder who does those? ex. Who wipes the counters? Do the kids put away their own toys? Vacuuming? Cleaning the bathrooms? He's leaving out a significant and daily portion of what it takes to keep a home running.", "Page not found", "I try to make a point to let my wife know how much I appreciate her, even if she's not doing extra stuff, just her normal chores. She works hard, she does a great job, and I want her to know that I appreciate it! It makes her feel good, and it costs me nothing, why is that so difficult for some people?", "She hasn't.", "I'm complaining about doing everything (not the lions' share) the past two weeks. For the past 2 weeks she's done nothing to help with the house or kids. When I had my covid shot 2 weeks earlier, i didn't get to check out for a day.", "Try the next sucker, I'm not dumb. He absolutely does.", "You don't mop your floors, like, ever?", "Lol yup. This sub and most of the parenting/relationship ones are very biased toward women. Many others are biased towards men.\n\nOn my old account, i got scolded for \u201cnot helping\u201d my SAHM as the sole income earner, even though I had ZERO free time. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I literally never did anything but work, chores, and kids. When I said that it was just a chorus of \u201cBUT SHES WORKING MORE\u201d. Actually no, our older two were in school and her mom takes the baby multiple hours every day while I was at work. The only one who got free time was her. The relationship was abusive overall, but I couldn\u2019t recognize it because everyone told me I just wasn\u2019t doing enough. This shits no good.", "Sorry, I updated the original post. Not sure why link didn't work.", "No, we don't mop hardwood floors. If you're hinting at them not being clean, I do use a bissel spin cleaner on them.. but I don't call that mopping like a bucket of water/mop."]}
