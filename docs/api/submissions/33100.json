Your husband needs to suck it up and learn how to care for his own child. Not only do you need and deserve the occasional break for your own mental health, but at some point in time your daughter is going to have to learn how to be in a situation without you there.

You need to stop giving her what she demands, let her melt down, and only give her your comfort and attention when she's worn herself out and is calm. It would be rough, but training her that if she throws a fit, she gets whatever she wants isn't a way to live.", "NTA  \n\n\nThere would have been a three adult to one baby ratio, so if he struggled, the other two could help a bit.  \n\n\nIf you can't convince your husband that **he has got this** in a gradual way, there's always cold turkey.   Plan to take a weekend away, give him a month to prepare and then leave the two of them together.   Maybe have a friend stop in and see how they are getting on.    \n\n\nYour daughter will have her moments, but they won't last.", "NTA at all. For both you and your daughter's sakes, she needs to feel secure when you're not around. Like, what if you got in an accident or sick and were in the hospital for a week? Is he gonna bring her up there for you to watch her?", "NAH, but also, this arrangement is unsustainable. Hopefully you both can work out how to help the baby bond with dad. He should be an equal partner, not someone who can only watch THEIR OWN CHILD while the child sleeps or if you're there. That's ridiculous. There will be an adjustment phase, and possibly some uncomfortable crying time, but your husband needs to try to learn how to soothe the baby when you're not around. Perhaps some hands-on parenting classes or in-home support/direction for him? We have Parents as Teachers as an example in my area. They go to the home and help with a variety of things for new parents. Please don't let him use this as an excuse much longer. You need to be able to run errands, have a spa day, etc, without having to constantly have the baby with you.", "NAH\n\nBut she can't get used to it until she repeatedly does it. Time to start scheduling time with just dad until she's ok with either of you.", "NTA.  Your husband needs to learn to settle your child.

Both of you have created this monster & it\u2019s going to take both of you to break her of this.", "I understand your predicament but surely you're not trying to blame a one-year-old for getting upset when you leave her with her father.\n\nINFO: Are you asking because your husband is refusing to deal with her meltdowns?
