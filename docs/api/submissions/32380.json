Though I would also not say *\"I don't owe his kids shut and that he chose to breed so he can buy them whatever he wants them to have\"* \\- that did seem a bit like adding fuel to the conflict, if you catch what I mean.  That said, gifts are not something you demand and his reaction was not OK, and was in fact very rude. Not buying hundreds of dollars of toys to his kids doesn't make you an A-hole even if you are able to afford it. \n\nIt seems to me (based on what you indicated) like his reaction migth have come from a place of resentment about his life choices and your success that you can afford certain things, so maybe you guys should talk about this instead of letting it foster and it resulting in random conflicts like this. \n\nI have a nephew and I live abroad so I tend to bring him stuff when I can but my sister never demand i Give him gifts or complain if I don't. That would be just weird to me and her. In fact, if she wants to get him something more expensive that he needs or is a meaningful enough toy, she asks me if (instead of buying something random when I feel like it) I want to contribute to this bigger thing, that way, it's not a financial burden on anybody and he also doesn't end up with a lot of random toys and gifts he doesn't care about.

Why if you can afford a medium", "YTA for the both of you.  First off, you have no obligation to lavish expensive gifts on his children or anyone.

They were literally worth more per ounce than gold at one point. \n\nIt\u2019s not really a side hustle for us but my husband likes legos and buys them and I have no problem as the resell value is crazy. Plus he\u2019s in their special memberships thing where he gets the opp go buy things first or that others can\u2019t buy. He uses those items to trade to sell for sets he missed out on or wants.
