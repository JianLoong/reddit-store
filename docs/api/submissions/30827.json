Prior to the house, we had lived with him for around 1-2 years in our apartment. No issues. We have been in our home about 5 years now. I will say previous he had been the perfect roommate. We all had fairly similar schedules and no issues. He previously was very solitary and did not go out much other than work and home. We all are pretty introverted and like our space. Now, over the last year he has been much more social, goes to the gym, etc. this is great. Around 3-4 months ago, he got a girlfriend and they immediately start hanging out everyday and she was staying over practically every single night. She was only gone like 2 nights within a 2 month time period at first. Things got really frustrating fast. They immediately started having loud sex every night and being loud in general. Mind you, he himself isn\u2019t very loud, but his girlfriend is. She has yet to actually introduce herself and at most has just said hi. That\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a requirement, just a little odd. But the noise got to be so bad. I would wear earplugs and play music but still could hear them. Our house is very small. 2bed 2bath. \n\nWe all wake up pretty early for work, and they would be loud (sex or not) until midnight even on weeknights when we all had work the next day. We have been super mindful of our own noise on nights where he works the next day etc. now they are keeping p us up all of the time. Then to top it off, she sets an alarm to get up before everybody and leave the house before we all get up for work. This is loud and then obviously wakes us all up again. \n\nWe have had multiple conversations with him about it. We came to an agreement that after 10 pm they would try to be quieter. Obviously this still isn\u2019t the case most of the time. I have had to text him multiple times to ask them to keep it down. I could even hear an alarm go off at 10pm from his room, but they would still continue to be loud. Then came the fact that she is here every single night. \n\nLike I said previously, we are pretty introverted, so having somebody we don\u2019t know in our space every day has been really frustrating. I ended up texting him about a month ago asking if it would be okay if she only stayed overnight max like 4 nights a week to which he agreed. (She would still come over, but would leave when everybody went to sleep) as much as I wanted to say don\u2019t come over at all on those days, it didn\u2019t feel right to request that. I figured I\u2019d take what I could get. This has gotten better. But she is still staying overnight 5-6 days out of the week despite him agreeing. \n\nAt this point we have made a few requests, and even if he agreed, he hasn\u2019t been following through. Am I being unreasonable? I\u2019m almost ready to just ask him to make sure he is out by Jan 31st because I\u2019m losing my sanity.", "created_utc": 1699778475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tg464/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_his_gf_cant_stay/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He and his girlfriend are acting like rude AHs, and you're risking letting the gf establish tenancy rights by letting this happen.\n\nSo, if you have a lease, you need to make sure that \"no guests more than 3 consecutive days/10 days total per month\" or whatever is in it.\n\nQuiet hours are a thing, often by law, and you can also put those in a lease.\n\nIf it's at all possible, just give notice and have him/them move out.", "NTA. That's incredibly rude. I'm guessing you didn't put this in the lease, but standard leases generally do have clauses about how often a tenant can have an overnight visitor, so what you're asking for isn't remotely out of the ordinary. I'd also kick him to the curb, especially since he's your friend, not just a random tenant, and he hasn't made any effort to introduce her to you.", "NTA, that much is a roommate. Does she shower there and eat meals there as well? That's a roommate.", "NTA. You\u2019re right that he, of course, has rights to guests. But someone being over every day, for most of the day if not also the night, is not a guest. They\u2019re another roommate that you\u2019re supplementing. \n\nIf you guys have tried to talk it out multiple times and its either not working or not doing enough for you guys to be comfortable in your home, its definitely time for the discussion about seperating homes.", "4 days per week is too much. Less than half is not unreasonable. You pay for the serenity if home and they're stomping on it. GL!", "NTA These are perfecty reasonable requests. I was in a similar situation once where my roommate asked me to not have my ex over so much because she didn\u2019t feel 100% comfortable in her own home since she didn\u2019t know him. I hadn\u2019t thought of that until she said it but I fully understood, apologized and complied. If you live with other people you have to be mindful and respectful of their comfort.", "NTA. \n\nI also rent out a room in my house, and I know this can be a contentious issue. He's not being reasonable - the girlfriend has almost moved in by stealth, and is running up your electricity bills. \n\nOne of the defter ways of stopping people from acting like this is a rule that for every night she stays at your house, he has to stay at her house for one night. \n\nBut whatever rule you have, I would try actually enforcing it before going for eviction. Inevitably evicting him will end the friendship. \"Come on Kylie, time to leave, you've already stayed here 4 nights this week like we agreed, you'll be welcome back on Monday\"", "definitely NTA. you tried many ways to settle in peace but this is just disrespectful.", "NTA. \nHopefully they\u2019re saving up to get their own place", "NTA, it's disrespectful to ignore your requests to keep it down beyond 10 pm  \n\n\nINFO: what are your terms on his lease about guests?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ask for an extra roommate.", "NTA you've increased the utilities and usage of the house. I think you'd be well within your right to tell him he needs to find another place, that yours isn't big enough for two more people. You agreed to let him live with you, not his gf. He's breaking the agreement.", "She\u2019s there to often and needs to pay rent. The noise level will most likely continue to be a problem if he stays. It may be time for him to move on.

I would just honestly ask him to leave. As long as you give him adequate notice, there is nothing wrong with parting ways, even if you had a super relationship in the past. People change and situations change and there is nothing wrong with moving on.", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of people giving you advice but they are using landlord tenant law but in most areas the situation you have would considered your friend a lodger or boarder and the laws about guests and eviction are often different and benefit the landlord because of the safety needs of a landlord who also lives in the space.

They are loud and rude together. That's how it is. If the co-living arrangement is over, let it be over. Give him notice.\n\nAnd whether or not you, as a couple, end his tenancy, you can still speak up more. When they're being loud past 10pm, knock loudly on their door. Talk to them both about her morning alarm waking you up and being intrusive. Clarify with him that she's around too often and it's not the literal sleeping, it's the loud activities and her presence that's too much.\n\nBut yes it seems that your time is up as roommates. If you give him notice ASAP, that gives them plenty of time to figure out a new situation.

When people stay over a certain amount of days or start receiving mail or things like that, they become a legal resident - regardless of if there is a lease or other rental agreement in place - and it becomes HELL to get them out. Like going to court and starting eviction proceedings to get them out type of hell.\n\nI'd go ahead and for the sake of your friendship (or what's left of it) and serve that notice to vacate by 1/31/24.
