You should not have rescheduled in the first place.", "NTA why should you have to push the vacation back a day because of his work??  Him meeting you there is the perfect alternative.", "NTA for the vacation, but AH for being with a guy who cares next to nothing about your daughter as compared to his comfort. You should not make this person a part of your daughter's life for much longer.", "NTA\n\nHe agreed to the plans, it's not reasonable to expect you to rearrange everything at the last minute.", "NTA. His lack of planning does not constitute your emergency. He should be ashamed to even ask you to move anything at the risk of disappointing your daughter. An adult should not put their procrastination above a child.", "NTA.  YWBTA if you don't go as planned.  This is about your daughter primarily.  Everyone else is secondary.", "NAH. It is your trip with your daughter. When a whole bunch of other family were coming it made sense that your bf was coming too. Now they're not. Maybe bf can join you for part of the time, but he shouldn't have been required to book or pay for it. \n\nYou handled it fine. Stick to your original schedule and if he can join so be it. What matters is mother-daughter time. Hope she has fun!", "NTA. Go, have a great time and if he shows up, fine. This is about your daughter, not your (cheap) bf.", "Your priority first and always should be coming before your boyfriend.

You are doing right by your daughter.", "NTA", "Absolutely positively NTA. This trio is about your daughter,  not your family or your boyfriend!!

I absolutely HATE when people don't stick to planning. Happened to my brother this summer. He and his friends planned a vacation to Spain. They were staying at an apartment owned by one of the friend uncles but when my brother +gf had already bought tickets everyone else backed out. They did what you also should. They went anyway and had a great time. Perhaps even a blessing in disguise to have that one on one bonding time.", "NTA\u2013 you snooze, you lose.  How do you forget to book a hotel?  Or forget the dates to take time off?  You can only accommodate people so much for a very specific window of time, oh and by the way, this isn't about your mom, sister or boyfriend, it's supposed to be about your daughter.\n\nAlso, your boyfriend can also decline to pay for costs like this instead of whatever he just did; why volunteer and not follow through?  That's a red flag if you ask me.", "You can do better than this cheapskate irresponsible boyfriend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Delayed to accommodate your mother and sister, so it became just a holiday. they drop out and your BF wants to delay it again because of his poor planning.\n\nWell done for putting daughter first as three adults have messed with this trip forgetting they are messing with a child feelings.\n\nAll she needs is you and her.", "Thank you, I sure will enjoy it and I'm certain my daughter will too \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "I thought him meeting is there was fair too.

I really don't care if he catches up or not atp. \n\nHe can go cry in the corner", "Go have fun.  He can either catch up and meet next day or stay home and pout like a toddler.", "If he procrastinates on stuff like booking a hotel room, I'd be skeptical of whether he actually talked to his boss or just says he did.\n\nLike maybe he said he did and that it was good, but hadn't actually done it yet, but when he finally did, it was too late and his boss said \"no\". Dunno why he might have thought it was a good idea, if that's what happened. But, if he has a habit of procrastinating in one area of this stuff, it makes it more likely he might in other areas too.\n\nSide-note: If he never follows through on booking stuff, maybe stop taking him up on the offer. If he wants to pay, have him Venmo you. I'd say have him cough up his card so you could use it, but that's just tempting fate with hotel booking policies.\n\nEspecially with the current \"I can't get time off\" issue, better all around that you book something like this yourself, so that it doesn't matter if he actually makes it or not.", "Good for you, OP!  Don't take his BS; he FAFO'd.", "WOW he actually said that?? I\u2019d tell him he was not only not my family but not a part of my life anymore", "Yup.. I wish I could post the text messages"]}
