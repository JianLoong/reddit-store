These are not a breed you can leave home alone or neglect training.

Idk man I'd just drop it or drop the friendship. You're moving in AH territory", "NTA. You are absolutely not wrong to have told her this. It might appear to be pushy/unasked for/interfering but I don't care. She needs to be told and reminded of this. You are correct: the wellbeing of a dog (or cat or any other pet) is everyone's business. If she can't understand the dog's essential needs and if she can't meet them, she has no business putting a dog through this.\n\nToo many people get pets without properly understanding their needs. And with a dog such as a Border Collie it is vital to understand them as they are a working dog withh high intelligence. Insufficient exercise and insufficient stimulation is going to produce a bored and probably aggressive dog. Her neighbours are likely to suffer as if he is left alone he may well start barking a lot.\n\nFrom the Purina website: \"...a bored, under-stimulated Border Collie is no fun at all to live with - and can become anything from hyperactive to noisy to destructive to aggressive. This is a dog for the real canine enthusiast whose life will revolve around their dog.\" (A pet food website)\n\nFrom the PDSA website: \"Owners considering a Collie will need a large, secure garden for them to play and run in between walks. Your Collie will need a minimum of two hours exercise every day, but with Collies the more, the better! We'd recommend spreading this across the day in several walks with off-lead exercise in a secure area.\" The PDSA is a UK charity; the vet charity for pets in need ie they can provide free vet care if you can't afford it (subject to financial checks).", "NTA. This is absolutely a bad situation for the potential puppy of that breed.  The poor thing will almost certainly be miserable.

I have four kids who are active and older.\n\nWe are an ideal family, on paper, to have a breed like a setter.\n\nAnd you know what? It\u2019s still overwhelming and exhausting. \nHe is a ton of work. He needs a lot of exercise and mental stimulation.\n\nHe gets it but he still finds ways to mischievous and it\u2019s hard. \n\nThe puppy stage is so much work and can be disheartening.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine simple things, like potty training a busy dog like that with little to no space.\nOurs was easy to train, but that wasn\u2019t without effort and work. The huge, fenced in yard and the fact that he was born on a farm\u2026made potty training stupidly easy. He has accidents because, like busy toddlers\u2026he forgets he has to pee and forget to let us know.\n\nTraining him is an ongoing effort and we practice everyday\u2026but that isn\u2019t without discouragement and lots of fails.\n\nPuppies like to bite. Herding breeds use their teeth to get what they want\u2026that\u2019s how they move their herds,.\n\nOur setter will cause a riot if he is bored.\nWe\u2019ve already had to replace a tv cord and he\u2019s gotten into the trash several times\u2026.and this is with little time being left alone.

Oh dear god no.  Border collies are working dogs.  They need a job, by which I mean they need something physical to accomplish all day every day, and they need a LOT of daily exercise and they need owners who know border collies.  There's a reason the classic situation for a border collie is herding sheep - it's physical and running all day, it requires intelligence and being able to communicate with both sheep and humans, and since both their brain and their body are being used all day they end up tired and happy.  I fostered a border collie one time because it was an emergency situation, and though various circumstances he ended up being a long term foster.  I loved him so much, and my situation was so wrong for him, and he and I and my other dog were all the worse off for it.\n\nI used to say that I could use bungee cords on my trash can, and then wrap it with a ratcheting tie-down of the type you use to hold things on cars, then encase it in three layers of lead and drop it into the deepest part of the ocean, and I'd still come home to find the trash all over the floor.  The bungee cords and ratcheting tie-down are true, then I put the trash can in a closet that closed tightly and had a round knob.  Every day, the same thing; garbage can out and open and trash all over.  **I couldn't give him a job, so he made his own.**  This is what will happen with your friend.\n\nIf your friend gets a border collie, the dog will end up at Animal Control or (preferably) at a no-kill rescue or (even more preferably) a border collie rescue organization.  I thought I could handle him because I'd had so many dogs of so many different breeds in my life.  My friend who works with a border collie rescue org told me I was not the right kind of person to have a border collie because I was away all day, couldn't take him running so he could get real exercise (spinal issues, can not run), and because I had another dog and this particular border collie tended to be jealous.  She was absolutely correct.  He wasn't happy with me, and I couldn't adjust my situation so that he would be happy.  He found a home on a farm where he could run and have long discussions with the other animals and he was so much happier.\n\nShe doesn't know dogs, and she really doesn't know border collies.  If she thinks \"a lot of exercise\" is two walks a day, she's in for a world of grief.  If she wants a dog, she should not get a border collie.  I'd like to suggest her closest animal shelter or animal control, and that she get a nice non-puppy non-working dog already house trained and out of the chew on everything stage, roughly 4 years old.  Adopt, don't shop.\n\nETA: if the border collie is coming from a breeder, that's a dreadful breeder.  He should check out the situation he's sending his dogs into, and make sure they're going where they can be supported correctly.", "Why do college girls always get the most hyper hard to control dogs \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02, I had a Ex who is the same as your friends and got a high energy dog.

Situations like hers fit cats way better than dogs.", "NTA\n\nShe has no business getting a border collie in a 30m2 flat and leaving it alone all day.

They definitely need exercise, training and stimulation but there are various ways to do that. \n\nYou don't know for a fact that she will neglect this dog. She's allowed to get it and try. One hopes that she changes her schedule around so that she stops home in the middle of the day to feed, walk and play with it.
