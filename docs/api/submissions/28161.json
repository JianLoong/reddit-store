He has no curtains but lots of windows, and I have a really hard time sleeping when the sun is shining right through the windows. I tried wearing an eye mask but I can't stand the feeling of something on my face when I'm trying to fall asleep. Every few months I say something along the lines of \"do you think you could please get blackout curtains soon? Sleep is really important to me and I can't sleep with all this light.\" He's usually dismissive and says I'm acting like a child begging for something from a parent. He always uses the excuse that his parents will be going to IKEA when they visit his sister in college every few months, yet they're always out of stock of these damn curtains. I've told him he can literally get them online with free shipping yet he always puts it off. I reminded him again this morning after not mentioning it for months, and he said \"Ok, I'll look this week. I might not buy them though.\" I just don't understand why he's so stubborn? Is my request really that insane?? I'm getting to the point where I'm not that nice about it when I bring it up because it has been so long and he's dragging his feet for no good reason. We don't live together and I only sleep at his place for 1 or 2 nights a week, so I'm wondering if this is contributing to his stubbornness. Still, I'm not sure why a person wouldn't want curtains. I should also add that I've offered several times to buy them myself and he has a very negative reaction, saying \"No I'm not letting you do that. I'll get them sometime\". If he'd said yes, I would've bought them instantly and we could've been done with this year long disagreement.", "created_utc": 1696349395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yvzsh/aita_for_repeatedly_asking_my_boyfriend_to_get/", "score": 1039, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
