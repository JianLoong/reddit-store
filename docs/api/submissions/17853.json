I'm glad her dad actually cares about her, unlike you.", "But\u2026her \u2018behaviors\u2019 only happen around YOU at YOUR house. Maybe YOU are the problem?", "It doesn\u2019t actually sound like you\u2019re doing much parenting, I don\u2019t see sacrificial love.\n\nI can\u2019t comment on your ex\u2019s quality of parenting, but he at least seems willing to deal with her.", "You ARE abandoning your child though. Being a parent means being there for them no matter what for the rest of their lives. Not until it gets a bit stressful or expensive and then you just bail. You need to take a long hard look at yourself.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Many families won\u2019t even visit their kids and volunteer/ staff interaction is all they get.", "What are the odds that she doesn't actually have destructive behavior and just drops things accidentally like kids do?", "According to a quick google search, autism can be detected during pregnancy. I don\u2019t know why she even decided to keep the pregnancy if she wanted a \u201cnormal\u201d kid.", "If she is 9 and you still don't understand that all behavior is communication, I have serious doubts you've ever made any attempt to learn about autism. You want to \"minimize and reduce\" her behaviors, not understand them.", "Please look into the Autism Speaks organization a bit more. It is very controversial and many are against it due to the framing of autism as a problem, which it seems you\u2019ve fed into.\n\nYou\u2019re daughter\u2019s \u201cdestructive\u201d behavior is her communicating since she doesn\u2019t have any other way, or so she feels at your home apparently.", "Autism Speaks is an awful ableist organization.", "Yta!!! Autism speaks is a hate group!!!! No wonder she doesn't act out at her dad's. What did you put that poor girl through?", "You\u2019re the one \u201cdoing some actual parenting\u201d - what like going to court to get your visitation taken away? Wow YTA", "I know.   I was being ironic", "Considering how she describes the child's behavior, this is more about how much, or little attention, the mother pays towards her.", "All kinds of kids sometimes have destructive behavior. If she threw down a controller and stomped on it, that\u2019s pretty destructive. Many autistic kids have destructive/aggressive behaviors for many reasons. My nephew breaks absolutely everything. It\u2019s exhausting and incredibly frustrating at times, especially for his parents. Just FYI.", "No it cant. edited to add: there is one study published in one journal hypothesizing that you can detect autism by measuring a fetus' brain using an MRI. This is not a test that is performed by any hospital currently. We can only detect autism behaviorally after a child is born. Even if this was a test that we did routinely for every pregnancy, it is only detectable starting in the second trimester when an abortion would no longer be legal in many places.", "Ewww. Even if that were true (hint, it\u2019s not).  Just ewwww.", "No it isn't, there is a lot of good people there and their therapies work as long as you put them in practice constantly. With my ex being the \"funny dad\" what I try to enforce on my daughter has no continuity so she is out of control and doubling down on her stimming and behaviors. \n\nWe not agreeing on how to deal with her is one of the reason for our divorce.", "It is not, never EVER i've heard someone in AS say \"We hate autistic people\" they wouldn't volunteer in an autism advocacy organization if they hated autistic people, saying that they are a hate group is nonsensical, they help thousands of people every years, but this is not a debate sub so we are not debating this.", "You are grossly mistaken. Some of their endorced therapies can be considered abuse in some states. If all the people in your life and all the people on the internet are telling you you're entirely wrong, how can you still stand here and defend the way you're handling this. If she's non-destructive at his house but very destructive at yours, then you're right, there are distinct parenting differences, but you're putting the blame on the wrong side. \n\nAlso let me guess. Your \"therapy\" involves eliminating stimming. If so, there's your reason as to why her stimming increases at your house. Stimming is a crucial part in helping to regulate oneself. \n\nMaybe have an in depth conversation with your husband and step son to figure out what you're so upset about that they don't mind dealing with.", "They barely have any people who work for them that are autistic. How can a group made 99% of non autistic people be able to actually advocate for autistic when they don't understand how they work.", "Riiiiiight and how many hate groups come right out and say it???
