It's something that's intimate and close, and we just decided we didn't want each other sharing that with anyone else. Absolutely mutual decision. Plus we're older and more financially stable now, we're not in a position where we can't afford a bigger/second hotel room if we travel with friends (as opposed to teenage or 20-something me piling into a room with as many people as would fit just so we got to enjoy a party!).\n\nAs I said, I made an exception when my sister needed me to stay with her, but that's very specific and very different.", "Opposite for me! It\u2019s usually like $10 more for a single.", "Seriously. Cheating on your SO is one thing. Making your SO pay to get cheated on is a whole other level of shitty", "The room agreement indeed wouldn\u2019t stop the bf cheating, however insisting on the arrangement of sharing a bed after OP stated being uncomfortable with a situation and offering reasonable alternatives (discounted hotels and etc), and just expecting OP to fund and facilitate something that they don\u2019t agree with is ridiculous.", "Because you wouldn\u2019t have said any of that if you agreed with what I said. That\u2019s what is happening and that\u2019s why she\u2019s not paying for the ticket. You\u2019d pay for a ticket for your SO to sleep in a bed with their ex? Answer the question", "Not an E S H because she was ok with those two going alone to begin with. Two rooms will not stop people from hooking up. It just gives them more rooms to use. \n\nIf she would had told him no from the start and the bf still went ahead to do this trip, than she wouldn\u2019t even be an asshole.", "That would happen when you understand common sense. So\u2026 probably not in this lifetime.", "If OP were a jealous person they would not have allowed the bf to take a trip with an ex at all. OP has no issues with the trip itself, just with the sharing of a one-bed hotel room. That\u2019s entirely reasonable.", "Lol has to be people getting caught doing nonsense and trying to plead ignorance as an excuse right? Like do these people sit down and outline every single thing someone can do wrong that would cause a breakup, because that would take days. I mean you didn\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t pull a wolf of Wall Street and snort coke off a strippers ass on our first date so how dare you get mad that I did such a thing! Reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where George gets caught having sex with the cleaning lady at work and he\u2019s telling his boss nobody told him not to do that when he got hired \ud83e\udd23", "Reddit is made of some of the ppl who think all of these things are ok in relationships, unfortunately", "[removed]", "I think he means a single king or queen sized bed.", "Yes I had a single bed in room when I went to Iceland last year.", "Depends where. I\u2019ve booked a single/twin bed for an upcoming trip", "I think many also now have 2 double(or full) size beds instead, which can fit adults better or a petite couple and their kids.  Single beds are getting rarer.", "They were on offer when I was looking for hotels in NYC. Not my first choice for vacation, but available.", "[removed]", "They do in most part of Europe. I'm not sure if they still do outside of that.", "They do in some parts of Europe but I haven\u2019t seen it in the US.", "Single bed as in one bed in the room.", "In the US travel industry a \"single\" refers to a room with a singular bed, and/or a singular occupant, not the mattress size. The OP later clarifies that is not a room with a twin size bed, but a room with a singular (Queen or King) sized bed.", "...who is crazy enough to pay for hotel laundry \ud83d\ude02 of course I'd rather do my own. \n\nAirbnb or similar rentals make me feel way more at home and have always worked out cheaper than a hotel for me. The only reason I stay at hotels is because I have so many points left from a previous job that sometimes it's free \ud83d\ude02", "You're missing out by just accepting the current bag feelings in the zeitgeist about airbnb. What you're saying or reading is not accurate.\n\nI generally pay about half what I would for a hotel at Airbnb. And there are not always \"chores\"-- I haven't ran into any that were unreasonable.\n\nI have about 30 stays since 2010. I have several kids in colleges all across the Eastern part of the us. I've never had any problems. I'm always satisfied and often more than satisfied.", "I actually stayed a hotel not that long ago where you could do your own laundry. I believe it was the Marriott. They had a laundry room the only thing is you'd have to pay for using the machines like you would at a laundromat. Granted we booked months in advance so our stay and overall expenses were relatively cheap.", "Right. Because they have a sexual/romantic history, evidencing that compatibility.", "And I don\u2019t mean necessarily intense spooning all night long, but it\u2019s hard to share a bed for 8 hours, rolling around and stuff without touching the other person. \n\nI\u2019d rather sleep on the floor than be that close to someone (other than my partner) for that long.", "Oh I agree. I said in another response she wasn\u2019t TA and her boundaries should be respected", "As a prolonged period of close proximity, touching and vulnerability, sharing a bed (with a former intimate partner) is in itself an act of intimacy that is reasonable to be uncomfortable with even if you take sex out of equation.", "I guess that\u2019s what I get for skimming the story instead of reading the whole thing \ud83d\ude02 I accept my down votes", "No fr, like I get something a little more specific like *being man/maid of honor in a sibling's or friend's wedding and being paired up with your ex with whom your sibling/friend is friends with*, but *not sharing a bad with your ex* or *not going to the strip club and getting a lapdance* or *not having your ex over during the night and end up cuddling half naked with them in the living room*?  There's no way you have to be sat down and told that.", "Right? \"OMG, just let me use your discount and to share a bed with my ex! You're ridiculous for bring uncomfortable with that. Don't you trust me?\" Not really cool. \n\nOP is being super cool. Lots of people would be more uncomfortable with this trip in the first place. They're getting a discount and still won't do anything to help OP be more comfortable. \n\nI dont think trusting someone means having zero boundaries.", "NTA if the two of you are not in a relationship them Just Go to your vacation If Thats already paid her has already family there so Just what you want to do", "True in Europe.

At the same time he is also really ungrateful, because OP is saving him so much money; so the least thing he could do is address her concerns about the bed.\n\nOn the other hand I also don\u2019t know how much sense it makes to even get into that kind of argument; OP is not there and ultimately he could tell her one of them slept on the ground or a cot or wherever, when in reality they did not because that would obviously be a lot less comfortable.\n\nI think it\u2019s either ESH or NAH and they have a deeper trust problem.", "Yesss your last example reminded me of a post here where a guy\u2019s girlfriend was out of town and he went hiking with a female friend and they got caught in the rain so when they got home of course they had to get naked out of wet clothes and check each other for ticks and oops they were exhausted so they took a nap in the same bed no biggie why is the girlfriend mad???

Intimate just means \u201cclose, private, personal.\u201d Sharing a bed with someone is intimate no matter who it is. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have sexual undertones, UNLESS the other person is someone you have (have had, might have, could reasonably perceived to have) sexual or romantic feelings for or contact with. \n\nThis context seems obvious to me and it\u2019s why OP is concerned. What seemed like a trip between friends turned into a bed-sharing with an ex when she found out they\u2019d be sharing a bed. OP\u2019s perception because the context changed: her bf wants to share a bed with his ex despite the other options available, and got defensive when she expressed discomfort with it.", "Oh yeah I remember that post, it was hilarious. Tho tbh I was quoting another one where a guy's girlfriend had her ex over watching movies and when he came home he found them asleep cuddling on the sofa while the ex was in his boxers. Absolutely bonkers to me. And he was asking if he's the asshole for??? Kicking the ex out??? Like sir you okay?", "\ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\udc80"]}
