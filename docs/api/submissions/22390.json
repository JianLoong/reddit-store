I found him some cheap hotel rooms which don't cost more than $150 for the night, and even offered to let him use my  industry discount on the room to cut the price even more.\n\nNonetheless the conversation escalated into an argument, where he started accusing me of being insecure and paranoid and they were just sharing to save money.

This was the only room available at that hotel for the price they wanted, and in the past we have both shared hotel rooms with our friends to save money.

If you\u2019re insecure about your relationship, then say it\u2019s that. It\u2019s not a boundary. If you think your partner will cheat and you don\u2019t trust him. Say that. If you think you\u2019re being taken advantage of. Say that. Stop using therapy speak as a shorthand and dig deeper so you can explain why you\u2019re going back on your word. You didn\u2019t give conditions for your favor, but now you are expecting them to abide rules they didn\u2019t know about. It\u2019s one thing to be the AH for a legitimate concern.", "If it were the other way around, would BF be ok footing the bill or providing perks that allowed you to spend a free weekend with an ex? I suspect not. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe's going on vacation and **sharing a bed** with his ex? Yikes. Not only were you right to cancel the plane tickets, I would be having some serious concerns about the relationship, too...", "NTA\n\nHe deliberately withheld information about the trip that nearly everyone would be uncomfortable with- he plans to share a bed with his ex. \n\nIf it were just about them saving money, your help in booking two rooms at a discount would have been the perfect solution. But then he doubled down and argued with you about that. \n\nTrust your gut here.", "Wait what, why is the vote Y T A? if my SO was going on a trip with their ex who is also a friend, i would very much expect them to not share a bed, regardless of the gender. They can also share a room with twin beds, why does it HAVE to be one bed? And as their partner i would completely respect the fact that my SO is uncomfortable for not being OK with me sharing a bed with my ex. WTH people? NTA", "NTA\n\nTo the \u201cyou either trust him or you don\u2019t\u201d crowd - that\u2019s not how trust works. It\u2019s not a binary do or don\u2019t. Trust exists on a scale, and must be fostered to continue to exist. It\u2019s also not entirely rational. You can trust someone but also be uncomfortable with a certain situation.\n\nI think it is eminently reasonable to not be comfortable with your partner sharing a bed and hotel room with their ex on a trip. It also blows my mind that your partner\u2019s reaction to your feelings about it was anything other than \u201coh of course, if you\u2019re uncomfortable with that we\u2019ll make different arrangements.\u201d", "YTA\n\nIt appears that this boundary was never something mentioned before and now you are using it to punish him.", "NTA.

You trust him enough to travel alone on your benefits, which means you\ntrust him with your career.\n\nTrust is a choice, you choose either to trust him or you don\u2019t.

Find a new boyfriend who does not give you reasons to doubt him.", "NTA. So he requested that you organize free plane fare for him, and then dropped the bomb that he'd be sharing a room and bed with his ex? No. He purposefully waited to fill you in on that. You're not paranoid nor insecure. If he respected you, this arrangement would have never been in his plans. Drop him", "YTA. Some people disguise control by calling it a boundary. And, that is what you are doing.", "INFO: did he let you know in advance that he would be sharing the room with the ex? Have you met this person and are they such good friends?", "NTA!!! In what world does he think it would be acceptable to share a bed with his ex while they go on vacation and use your discount. Tf?", "NTA!", "NTA for setting a boundary, and you aren\u2019t obligated to use a perk from work to enable a situation you aren\u2019t comfortable with. The fact that he got so defensive would have shut that gate for me too.", "NTA, ask him how he'd feel if you went on a trip with your ex and had to sleep in the same bed.

It\u2019s one thing to be the AH for a legitimate concern.\n\nExpecting her boyfriend to not share a bed with his ex is an extremely reasonable expectation.  I fact, that's the default expectation, it's not a rule that needs to be stated.", "On the other hand, it does seem like the partner is taking advantage of the situation and op's work benefits, and purposefully not disclosing all information until the very last minute. Yes, there were no conditions, but there also wasn't all the information and I think the op's partner isn't truly honest.", "I think asking her to provide airfare for him to share a bed with a former partner is a pretty j reasonable request", "Not wanting your partner to sleep in the same bed with someone they used to date is a legitimate concern. Why would I help you with when you won\u2019t take my feelings into consideration. A lot of hotels have rooms with a king bed or double beds that are around the same rate. I know this for fact since I travel a lot from 3 star to 5 star hotels. And pricing is subject to what views, upgrades in rooms, and sizing. I can see sharing a room with double beds to save money or they waited so long decent hotels were booked. But to get one room with one bed was a choice he made and op can choose not to let them use her perks. The relationship will be over most likely but to me the relationship would have been over when he chose to share a bed with someone he dated prior. NTA", "That's my bad. I edited the post as I realised I never mentioned that it was a single bed (that's the only room the hotel was offering for that price)", "I'd say it was not just to save money because OP offered hotel discount too which only escalated situation. IDK if I'd take back my promise to get them free flight but I see OP's frustration and anger justified.", "This was my thought as well. The boundary became an ultimatum with no prior discussion. That\u2019s a YTA move.", "Is \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with you sharing a bed in a hotel room with your ex\u201d really a boundary that needs to be stated ahead of time?", "\"Oh, and in case it ever comes up, please don't share a bed with your ex\" . I have never, ever set this boundary or had to set this boundary in any relationship.  Seems a pretty common sense line in most relationships and when she found out about it, she set the boundary.", "How dare OP be uncomfortable that her boyfriend wants to share a bed with an ex and neglected to share that info, even when presented with other viable options that still would've saved them money.\n\nYou need to grow up.", "Trusting someone isn't always that simple and to believe otherwise is immature.", "Trust is neither a choice nor is it binary.
