Yesterday I went to my uncles house for a stay over. once I arrived to the house, I took off my bra as usual and just started to get comfortable. at dinner time, I noticed my uncle and male causin acting a bit weird around me, and my aunt and female cousin were giving me looks I couldn't tell what for. after dinner, my female cousin pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't wearing a bra. I told her because we are in the house. She told me that my uncle and her brother was in the house too. I got confused and told her so what, I also have a dad and brother at my house, they never cared if I wore a bra or not in the house. she got annoyed and told me to wear it and that I can take it off before sleep and to put it back on once I wake up. I refused and told her I was not going to spend the whole day in my bra. she told me she and her mom does and that I'm being dramatic. I said no again, walked out her room and basically spent the whole night in the guest room where I was gonna sleep. now its morning as I'm writing this, I'm not wearing a bra and both my cousin and aunt gave me annoyed looks and a forced good morning when I said good morning to them. Now I feel a little guilty. Should I just wear the bra? AITA for not?\n\nedit, just so yall know: my breasts arent big. and yesterday the guys only saw me for like an hour while we were eating and I greeted them. nor did they bounce like, at all. and also, I was wearing a black oversized hoodie, they weren't visible, my nipples weren't hard. literally only thing was that they were moving freely.", "created_utc": 1669476387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5a2p3/aita_for_not_wearing_a_bra_in_my_uncles_house/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not going around naked. Any woman should be free to wear or not to wear a bra anywhere as she pleases. Bras are meant for support and comfort not to hide boobs.

Why are your family members paying such close attention to your boobs? I stopped wearing bras years ago and almost no one comments aside from the occasional asshole. It's not like you're running around naked. Tell your family it's weird they pay so much attention to your underwear situation.", "NTA. Americans will act all high and mighty because they don't force women to wear a veil and then say shit like this lmao \nIf I went into someone's house and they forced me to wear a veil because I am a woman I wouldn't do it, and it is not nearly as uncomfortable as a bra.", "NTA - Not to sound creepy, but how much did they look at your boobs to realize you weren\u2019t wearing a bra under a black oversized hoodie???\n\nWould anyone stare at a male\u2019s crotch to check if they are wearing underwear, even though they\u2019re wearing pants? No, because it\u2019s not appropriate! So why should it be different with women\u2019s boobs? \n\nPlus the whole \u201cthis is not your house\u201d excuse is kind of ridiculous. It\u2019s not your house, but it\u2019s your body and you don\u2019t need to wear a bra. Clearly, you weren\u2019t putting your boobs in people\u2019s faces because you were wearing a comfy hoodie, so why the hell do people care? I really don\u2019t understand why this is an issue in 2022\u2026", "NTA. Your uncle and cousin seem a bit creepy and too preoccupied with your breasts. I wouldn\u2019t spend the night over there again for your own safety. If they require women to wear bras all day because they can\u2019t control themselves they are the problem not you.", "NTA. ffs it\u2019s 2022. No one ever has to wear a bra. It would be normal for you to decide to literally never wear one.

You were wearing a shirt and that\u2019s sufficient.", "NTA. If your uncle and cousin can\u2019t control their gaze around breasts in their natural un-brassiere state, especially family members, they\u2019re the problem, not you. \n\nBut factoring in your aunt and cousin (F) spend 16 or more hours a day in a bra, I can see why they\u2019re so uptight. \n\nNTA, let them titties hang free.", "I\u2019m confused on the y t a?

Is it the sound of the breasts flapping against your skin as you run down the stairs? The missing bulge of cleavage at the neckline? Or are they just afraid of nipples? This is a take that screams of misogyny. Do they also believe women who get assaulted deserve it if they aren\u2019t wearing turtlenecks? \n\nIf your cousin and uncle feel unfettered breasts might run them into predators then don\u2019t stay with them anymore.

Then YTA.\n\nIt makes them uncomfortable in their OWN house. It doesn't matter why. All that matters is that it does. They're your cousins and your uncle. \n\nI will stress that not wearing a bra in the house is fine as long as other people are okay with it. If you're in your house, your rules. If you're in another person's house, be a bit more respectful.  \n\nBefore someone tells me it's not disrespectful. Respect is relative. Her uncle and her cousins found it disrespectful and were uncomfortable. Again OP, YTA.", "NTA. No one should be forced to wear a bra if they are uncomfortable with it. It doesn't matter who's company you're in, there's nothing wrong with not wearing a bra.", "NTA - boobs aren\u2019t offensive in their natural state and you should never feel pressure to conform to someone else\u2019s standard of beauty. Hope you don\u2019t have to return to this house anytime soon.", "NTA. You weren't topless. Was everyone's underwear checked? Did anyone question why your male relatives were looking at your chest so closely that they thought they could tell what you were wearing? Any drama here was caused by people who wanted...drama!", "NTA lol that\u2019s a weird rule", "NTA do what you want they are ahs", "NTA. I bet they're the kind of people who would tell a breastfeeding mother to cover up as well. I'm sorry that many of the people in your story have bronze age beliefs.", "NTA, what fucking century is this? They burned bras in the 60s for your right to be comfortable.", "NTA if your own family is sexualizing you or anyone they are related to that\u2019s creepy. I also take my bra off as soon as I get home. I also spend a lot of time with family and have gone all day no bra and my uncles and male cousins don\u2019t stare or act funny.", "NTA. That\u2019s really creepy. Also, the old \u201cI\u2019m a man so I can only notice b00bz\u201d is outdated and gross.", "For me you are NTA - Its not like you were naked.", "NTA. You just shouldn\u2019t have worn a bra in the first place, then no one needed to know you took it off.", "NTA - did you ask why your uncle and cousin were staring at your breasts? Screw them.", "NTA. Just stop wearing bras entirely, it's so much more comfortable. I only wear mine if the cut of a top absolutely needs one (which is very very rare). If the people at the grocery store can handle my boobs, your relatives should be able to.", "NTA\n\nif they wanna wear a bra, kudos to them. if you don\u2019t wanna wear a bra, that\u2019s awesome, let them girls fly.", "NTA. I see posts like this quite a bit and I never understand what the issue is and neither do my friends. I\u2019m a Brit early 20s average to biggish sized boobs and I literally wear a bra once a week when I go on a night out. I don\u2019t wear one at work, I don\u2019t wear one around family. I\u2019ve never ran into an issue because no body cares about it. No one\u2019s ever pointed it out, no one has ever acted awkward or stared. My guys friends don\u2019t see what the issue is girls wearing or not wearing bras. To quote my best guy friend \u201cthey\u2019re just tits half the people on the planet have tits, everyone has seen a pair of tits before\u201d\n\nMy other guy friend, he doesn\u2019t get the fascination with boobs either he said once drunk to me \u201cdon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird that people like looking at boobs because the first tit they\u2019ve sucked on is their mums\u201d", "100% NTA this is so dumb. No one should be policing how much underwear you're wearing. Tell them to stop staring at your boobs if it makes them so uncomfortable\n\nInfo: when your uncle and cousin go swimming do they wear a fucking wetsuit? In the summer, do they walk around without a shirt when it gets too hot? These double standards are fucking ridiculous.", "NTA. At all.\n\nDo the men in the house have to wear a braw if their nipples poke out of their shirt? I bet the answer is no.\n\nI find myself more and more going without a bra. When I have guests I do wear one, but that\u2019s because I feel weird.\n\nThe real question is, why do men feel uncomfortable when a woman doesn\u2019t wear a bra? Especially a relative? What does it have to do with them. It\u2019s not a secret that women have breasts.", "NTA. People have sexualized breasts for too long and made us contain them to the point of hurting our breasts/backs and to live in discomfort for no reason. Maybe the uncle and cousin should ask themselves why they find it sexual for you to not wear a bra. It's literally beyond insane to force people to wear bras", "NTA\nYour relatives' sexualizing your outfit is creepy. I wouldn't feel safe around men who view every woman as a sex object in every setting. They are the threat they think you need to armor your boobs against.", "NTA. Nobody is obligated to wear a bra. If you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t. \n\nIf they are uncomfortable seeing one of their family members while they don\u2019t wear a bra, then that certainly says more about them than you. \n\nBtw - tell you parents when you get home.", "Nta but kinda weird, unless I was 100% sure that everyone in the house would be comfortable with it I would not go to someone's house wearing a bra and then take it off when i got there. That's just super awkward, just don't wear a bra in general if you don't like em but taking it off around people who aren't comfortable with it feels like it's crossing a line.", "NTA\n\nI literally only wear bras to work. I would just stop visiting that family. Bras really shouldn't be a requirement. Of course, it's polite to be reasonably covered up in their house if they are anxious about it but it sounds like you were wearing a hoodie. I feel bad for all the women who have internalized all these rules they don't need to live by.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been \u201cbrafree\u201d for for ten years, and I do have bigger breasts(DD). It is your decision to wear a bra or not. Your body, your choice honey.", "NTA. I don\u2019t wear a bra at all. If someone doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s their problem", "Question for your auntie and cousin- do the boys/men in the house wander around in sweatpants or pj pants without underwear? Is that also considered unexceptable?", "NTA I only wear bra when I wear a form fitting t-shirt. If my top is large enough that it hide them well, fuck that annoying thing. It's uncomfortable as hell. I pity the girl who have big breast. Mine are small and I'm so grateful for it. It's weird that family members of yours stares enough to notice you don't wear one under a hoodie.", "NTA. If they are sexualizing anything about you it's their problem. I have many cousins and we've seen each other in various states of dress. It's not a big deal.  You were literally covered up so sounds like your uncle and cousin are just creepy.", "NTA- why are men not wearing cups then? What if they get hard? That\u2019s inappropriate\u2026", "If you do not like or cannot respect the rules of someone else\u2019s house, you should go home. Your cousin told you what the practice is at her house and you chose to do what you want it.", "You are NOT in Your home. You fail to 'read the room'. Your free moving boobs may not bother you BUT they bother other family members, both male & female. Be respectful. Wear a sports bra & stop creating drama unnecessarily.", "YTA. Only because you were a guest in someone else's home and they told you that your actions were making them visibly uncomfortable. There was an easy solve but you chose to be defiant. Yes they could change their views but the same way you appreciate being comfortable in your home with your family is the way they wanted to be comfortable in theirs.", "NTA. \n\nYou have authority over what you do or don\u2019t wear. Regardless of breast size or whatever else. Then sexualizing you and getting crass is THEIR problem that they need to grow up And take responsibility for. Screw modesty culture.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re walking around naked, or even topless. You\u2019re doing nothing wrong. If your uncle and cousin can\u2019t stop looking at your chest, that\u2019s their problem, not yours. It\u2019s disgusting they would look at female family members like that. \n\nWomen have been conforming to beauty standards since the beginning of time, and bras are a part of that. Bras offer no health benefits, and in fact, some research shows wearing bras may adversely affect breast tissue (there\u2019s not much research about this, so don\u2019t take this as saying they\u2019re bad for your health). There\u2019s no real reason to ever force someone else to wear a bra.

Bras are optional articles of clothing that no one is obligated to wear, ever. \u201cTheir house, their rules\u201d simply does not apply.", "NTA. It's on your uncle and cousin to pretend not to notice you weren't wearing a bra. Openly admitting that they did notice is gross and they should know better.", "NTA. You\u2019re covered up. Us guys can just look at your face. \n\nWe don\u2019t ask guys with man boobs to wear bras do we?", "NTA. People are weird.", "NTA. Your family are a bunch of judgmental prudes. I wouldn't stay at their house again if they are going to be so controlling about what you wear. Tell them to stop looking at your chest so much and mind their own business.\n\nI haven't even owned a bra in over six years. I'd laugh in their faces and tell them to get over themselves if they said that to me.", "NTA", "I'd totally be on your side if this happened in public or at your home, but it's their house, their rules. You're not an AH for not wearing a bra - and I honestly think that it's strange that your uncle and cousin get weird around braless women, especially *their own family* (given that your aunt and female cousin apparently wear bras all the time) - but you're an AH for not following their house rules. \n\nIf I were you, I would wear that bra now and never stay over again.", "NTA and it\u2019s creepy that your family members were looking at your titties like that. I rarely wore a bra around the house when my dad was alive and I can\u2019t imagine having to cover up because, he\u2019s my family, why would he be uncomfortable with it? Why would he be looking?? Weirdos, looking at their family members breast.", "YTA you're a guest in their house and you're making them uncomfortable.

You don't have a baggie sweater that would allow you the comfort of being braless without making them aware of your bralessness do you? Could you borrow one?\n\nEdit: I just saw your edit. Well hell, so much for compromise.", "ESH, this is just kinda weird. Why would you get undressed in someone else's house, even if you were staying over?

I have cousins that can receive guests wearing only their undies and they will not make any attempt to change. I have cousins that will only receive guests (yes, even their own parents/siblings) fully clothed.\n\nOn the other other hand, I had a friend who was very very... I have no idea what's the correct word to describe him in english... he's the kind of guy who received people on his undies, and when he visited other people, he wouldn't hesitate to get comfortable, although he did control himself a little, he never got full \"undies\" (... as far as I know... ) but he did take off his shirt and shoes.", "NAH.

Yesterday I went to my uncles house for a stay over. once I arrived to the house, I took off my bra as usual and just started to get comfortable. at dinner time, I noticed my uncle and male causin acting a bit weird around me, and my aunt and female cousin were giving me looks I couldn't tell what for. after dinner, my female cousin pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't wearing a bra. I told her because we are in the house. She told me that my uncle and her brother was in the house too. I got confused and told her so what, I also have a dad and brother at my house, they never cared if I wore a bra or not in the house. she got annoyed and told me to wear it and that I can take it off before sleep and to put it back on once I wake up. I refused and told her I was not going to spend the whole day in my bra. she told me she and her mom does and that I'm being dramatic. I said no again, walked out her room and basically spent the whole night in the guest room where I was gonna sleep. now its morning as I'm writing this, I'm not wearing a bra and both my cousin and aunt gave me annoyed looks and a forced good morning when I said good morning to them. Now I feel a little guilty. Should I just wear the bra? AITA for not?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also you've been replying pretty much the same thing to every comment, why are you so obsessed?", "Lol, undressing. You\u2019re a clown if that\u2019s what you think that is.", "And her bra was making her uncomfortable", "She wasn\u2019t undressing lmaooo she had a hoodie on.", "She is not undressing, her uncle and cousin are creepy and sexualising her body.", "Why are you acting like she stripped naked at the dinner table? You're a huge weirdo", "Well, are you a bra wearer? Cos even if you are, you can only go by your own experience.", "Not good at getting the point are you?", "Really? Because you seem pretty well versed in this", "That is not my logic", "I\u2019d have the same reaction if she was outraged by her cousin wearing sweatpants.", "1) that isn't what I asked.\n\n2) no one can makes rules about other people's underwear\n\n3) was there a sign posted somewhere?

It is distracting. Maybe not band aids but a padded cover.", "Still innapropriate", "You can move to some places in Africa-  the tribes there are more sociall accepting of bare breasts entirely.  But you won't, because of convenience.

And indeed we as humans, men and women alike, are sad and sick, but that is the reality of life. Most wom n, upon seeing a o nis, would think of sex, because that is what a penis is for. Same with breasts, they are also used for feeding babies but they too are used for sex as well, and having multiple purposes does not diminish the individual purposes. If he wasn't thinking of sex, why would the uncle not be disgusted? If anything, it is healthy to be disgusted by a sexual appearance of of a close relative.", "Yes, I read what I wrote, and it's to help you and that tooth fairy person I'm talking with see things from someone else's point of view. \"Why would I look at my uncle's dick?\" Same reason he might look at your breasts, no effort made to cover it and putting it in the open for others to see.

Why for their own safety??", "Cool idfc", "Hahaha legit", "It's not her house", "No I feel uncomfortable about them because in trans nothing to do with society.

But how would you find out? And as long as their bare arse isn't on show, why would you care?", "If someone told you they were absolutely disgusted because you decided to wear a binder, how would that make you feel? Do you think other people get the right to chose what you, a trans person, is appropriate to wear? The fact that you\u2019re all over this thread judging someone for not wearing what you deem is the correct underwear is extremely disconcerting.", "What kind of weird prudishness is this?

We may also assume at this point that OP did not let the girls out for air in front of everybody, as, given the overt sexualising of breasts in this household, nobody is accusing her of that. \n\nSo she says no, I ain't ashamed of my mammary gland, I'm gonna let them hang low, cos they're still covered up.", "your arguments are really bad", "If I knew they werent wearing underwear I'd be digusted because that isn't appropriate", "I don't wear binders I can't afford them.
