Yesterday I went to my uncles house for a stay over. once I arrived to the house, I took off my bra as usual and just started to get comfortable. at dinner time, I noticed my uncle and male causin acting a bit weird around me, and my aunt and female cousin were giving me looks I couldn't tell what for. after dinner, my female cousin pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't wearing a bra. I told her because we are in the house. She told me that my uncle and her brother was in the house too. I got confused and told her so what, I also have a dad and brother at my house, they never cared if I wore a bra or not in the house. she got annoyed and told me to wear it and that I can take it off before sleep and to put it back on once I wake up. I refused and told her I was not going to spend the whole day in my bra. she told me she and her mom does and that I'm being dramatic. I said no again, walked out her room and basically spent the whole night in the guest room where I was gonna sleep. now its morning as I'm writing this, I'm not wearing a bra and both my cousin and aunt gave me annoyed looks and a forced good morning when I said good morning to them. Now I feel a little guilty. Should I just wear the bra? AITA for not?\n\nedit, just so yall know: my breasts arent big. and yesterday the guys only saw me for like an hour while we were eating and I greeted them. nor did they bounce like, at all. and also, I was wearing a black oversized hoodie, they weren't visible, my nipples weren't hard. literally only thing was that they were moving freely.", "created_utc": 1669476387, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5a2p3/aita_for_not_wearing_a_bra_in_my_uncles_house/", "score": 5160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not going around naked. Any woman should be free to wear or not to wear a bra anywhere as she pleases. Bras are meant for support and comfort not to hide boobs. Totally NTA\n\nEdit: to all the people answering because it's their house, their rules, I ll reply here by quoting another comment \"you buy into the idea that not wearing a bra is inappropriate; sorry but people don't get to rule over other people's undergarments\". Being a woman and having boobs is not a shame or something to be discussed. \n\nThanks for the award and upvotes and for the civil conversations even with those I disagree with \ud83d\ude4f", "nta. i haven\u2019t worn a bra in four years. one day in high school i noticed my friend wasn\u2019t wearing one and i said hey, why are u wearing a bra and she said \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f you don\u2019t have to. and i was like woah. ur right. i don\u2019t have to. they\u2019re uncomfortable and i hate them. u should not be forced to wear a bra for anyone else u should wear it when and if you want to wear it", "NTA. Why are your family members paying such close attention to your boobs? I stopped wearing bras years ago and almost no one comments aside from the occasional asshole. It's not like you're running around naked. Tell your family it's weird they pay so much attention to your underwear situation.", "NTA. Americans will act all high and mighty because they don't force women to wear a veil and then say shit like this lmao \nIf I went into someone's house and they forced me to wear a veil because I am a woman I wouldn't do it, and it is not nearly as uncomfortable as a bra.", "NTA - Not to sound creepy, but how much did they look at your boobs to realize you weren\u2019t wearing a bra under a black oversized hoodie???\n\nWould anyone stare at a male\u2019s crotch to check if they are wearing underwear, even though they\u2019re wearing pants? No, because it\u2019s not appropriate! So why should it be different with women\u2019s boobs? \n\nPlus the whole \u201cthis is not your house\u201d excuse is kind of ridiculous. It\u2019s not your house, but it\u2019s your body and you don\u2019t need to wear a bra. Clearly, you weren\u2019t putting your boobs in people\u2019s faces because you were wearing a comfy hoodie, so why the hell do people care? I really don\u2019t understand why this is an issue in 2022\u2026", "NTA. Your uncle and cousin seem a bit creepy and too preoccupied with your breasts. I wouldn\u2019t spend the night over there again for your own safety. If they require women to wear bras all day because they can\u2019t control themselves they are the problem not you.", "NTA. ffs it\u2019s 2022. No one ever has to wear a bra. It would be normal for you to decide to literally never wear one. Everyone saying y t a is creepily fixated on women\u2019s bodies not being their own. \n\nI do not care whose house you\u2019re in or if they told you to wear one, it\u2019s your body. You were wearing a shirt and that\u2019s sufficient.", "NTA. If your uncle and cousin can\u2019t control their gaze around breasts in their natural un-brassiere state, especially family members, they\u2019re the problem, not you. \n\nBut factoring in your aunt and cousin (F) spend 16 or more hours a day in a bra, I can see why they\u2019re so uptight. \n\nNTA, let them titties hang free.", "I\u2019m confused on the y t a? My bra doesn\u2019t even last past the door way half the time and if I sleep over at any of my uncles or family\u2019s I\u2019m definitely not wearing bra and never felt like I had to no one ever has commented on that not my uncles , father or cousins. Only problem here are your uncle and cousin NTA that\u2019s mad creepy.", "NTA. What is their deal? Men's nipples show over their shirts all the time and nobody ever stares or cares. Why does this family have the urge to stare at yours? They wouldn't even know you're not wearing a bra had they not taken the time to examine the free movement of your boobs. What the hell.", "NTA. I hope you don\u2019t have to spend the night there ever again, so creepy.", "NTA, double standard. Everyone has nipples regardless of gender, but only you have to wear a bra.", "NTA\n\nWhat the been is wrong with people? \nYou have breasts. And nipples.\nSo does my FIL and nobody makes HIM put on another piece of undergarment. \n\nThe existence of one's body is not something that needs to be smothered and hidden.\nIf you're wearing a sheer peekabooteddy or something, you'd be ta, but assholes policing the mere existence of girls' bodies needs to end\n(Edit for typo)", "I guess my question would be what is the difference between bra and braless that\u2019s making such an impact? Is it the sound of the breasts flapping against your skin as you run down the stairs? The missing bulge of cleavage at the neckline? Or are they just afraid of nipples? This is a take that screams of misogyny. Do they also believe women who get assaulted deserve it if they aren\u2019t wearing turtlenecks? \n\nIf your cousin and uncle feel unfettered breasts might run them into predators then don\u2019t stay with them anymore. And if it\u2019s only the idea that proper women cover themselves with lycra, then don\u2019t stay with them anymore. \n\nNTA this is ridiculous.", "Heavy NTA.\n\nJust because you're staying with them does not mean they have a right to tell you what to wear.", "YTA. People in the comment section are delusional. If you are at your house, do whatever you want. It will be your house. If someone comes to your house, they need to respect your house and your comfort comes first. If you go to your uncle's house, and you do something that makes them uncomfortable. Then YTA.\n\nIt makes them uncomfortable in their OWN house. It doesn't matter why. All that matters is that it does. They're your cousins and your uncle.\n\nI will stress that not wearing a bra in the house is fine as long as other people are okay with it. If you're in your house, your rules. If you're in another person's house, be a bit more respectful.\n\nBefore someone tells me it's not disrespectful. Respect is relative. Her uncle and her cousins found it disrespectful and were uncomfortable. Again OP, YTA.\n\nEdit: My post legit went from 20 upvotes to -something. It's almost funny tbh.\n\nEdit: People fail to see that your personal opinion about whether a woman should or shouldn't wear a bra goes out of the window once you're in someone else's house and everyone there is uncomfortable in their own home.\n\nYou can look down on those people and say they're prudish and weird for placing these social norms. You are entitled to think that way. At the same time, you forget that you're in their house. YTA 100%.The mature thing to do was leave and never go there. I stick to my view. OP is 100% the asshole.\n\nI would also like to add that my personal opinion about this is irrelevant. I don't care what a woman wears. The family in the house does and I respect it. I guess, people nowadays are so entitled in their thinking that they think their way is superior and everyone else is wrong. I am mature enough to see all sides and not let my own personal biases dictate my actions.", "NTA. No one should be forced to wear a bra if they are uncomfortable with it. It doesn't matter who's company you're in, there's nothing wrong with not wearing a bra.", "NTA - boobs aren\u2019t offensive in their natural state and you should never feel pressure to conform to someone else\u2019s standard of beauty. Hope you don\u2019t have to return to this house anytime soon.", "NTA. You weren't topless. Was everyone's underwear checked? Did anyone question why your male relatives were looking at your chest so closely that they thought they could tell what you were wearing? Any drama here was caused by people who wanted...drama!", "NTA lol that\u2019s a weird rule", "NTA do what you want they are ahs", "NTA. I bet they're the kind of people who would tell a breastfeeding mother to cover up as well. I'm sorry that many of the people in your story have bronze age beliefs.", "NTA, what fucking century is this? They burned bras in the 60s for your right to be comfortable.", "NTA if your own family is sexualizing you or anyone they are related to that\u2019s creepy. I also take my bra off as soon as I get home. I also spend a lot of time with family and have gone all day no bra and my uncles and male cousins don\u2019t stare or act funny.", "NTA. That\u2019s really creepy. Also, the old \u201cI\u2019m a man so I can only notice b00bz\u201d is outdated and gross.", "For me you are NTA - Its not like you were naked.", "NTA. You just shouldn\u2019t have worn a bra in the first place, then no one needed to know you took it off.", "NTA - did you ask why your uncle and cousin were staring at your breasts? Screw them.", "NTA. Just stop wearing bras entirely, it's so much more comfortable. I only wear mine if the cut of a top absolutely needs one (which is very very rare). If the people at the grocery store can handle my boobs, your relatives should be able to.", "NTA\n\nif they wanna wear a bra, kudos to them. if you don\u2019t wanna wear a bra, that\u2019s awesome, let them girls fly.", "NTA. I see posts like this quite a bit and I never understand what the issue is and neither do my friends. I\u2019m a Brit early 20s average to biggish sized boobs and I literally wear a bra once a week when I go on a night out. I don\u2019t wear one at work, I don\u2019t wear one around family. I\u2019ve never ran into an issue because no body cares about it. No one\u2019s ever pointed it out, no one has ever acted awkward or stared. My guys friends don\u2019t see what the issue is girls wearing or not wearing bras. To quote my best guy friend \u201cthey\u2019re just tits half the people on the planet have tits, everyone has seen a pair of tits before\u201d\n\nMy other guy friend, he doesn\u2019t get the fascination with boobs either he said once drunk to me \u201cdon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird that people like looking at boobs because the first tit they\u2019ve sucked on is their mums\u201d", "100% NTA this is so dumb. No one should be policing how much underwear you're wearing. Tell them to stop staring at your boobs if it makes them so uncomfortable\n\nInfo: when your uncle and cousin go swimming do they wear a fucking wetsuit? In the summer, do they walk around without a shirt when it gets too hot? These double standards are fucking ridiculous.", "NTA. At all.\n\nDo the men in the house have to wear a braw if their nipples poke out of their shirt? I bet the answer is no.\n\nI find myself more and more going without a bra. When I have guests I do wear one, but that\u2019s because I feel weird.\n\nThe real question is, why do men feel uncomfortable when a woman doesn\u2019t wear a bra? Especially a relative? What does it have to do with them. It\u2019s not a secret that women have breasts.", "NTA. People have sexualized breasts for too long and made us contain them to the point of hurting our breasts/backs and to live in discomfort for no reason. Maybe the uncle and cousin should ask themselves why they find it sexual for you to not wear a bra. It's literally beyond insane to force people to wear bras", "NTA\nYour relatives' sexualizing your outfit is creepy. I wouldn't feel safe around men who view every woman as a sex object in every setting. They are the threat they think you need to armor your boobs against.", "NTA. Nobody is obligated to wear a bra. If you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t. \n\nIf they are uncomfortable seeing one of their family members while they don\u2019t wear a bra, then that certainly says more about them than you. \n\nBtw - tell you parents when you get home.", "Nta but kinda weird, unless I was 100% sure that everyone in the house would be comfortable with it I would not go to someone's house wearing a bra and then take it off when i got there. That's just super awkward, just don't wear a bra in general if you don't like em but taking it off around people who aren't comfortable with it feels like it's crossing a line.", "NTA\n\nI literally only wear bras to work. I would just stop visiting that family. Bras really shouldn't be a requirement. Of course, it's polite to be reasonably covered up in their house if they are anxious about it but it sounds like you were wearing a hoodie. I feel bad for all the women who have internalized all these rules they don't need to live by.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been \u201cbrafree\u201d for for ten years, and I do have bigger breasts(DD).

Is that also considered unexceptable?", "NTA I only wear bra when I wear a form fitting t-shirt. If my top is large enough that it hide them well, fuck that annoying thing. It's uncomfortable as hell. I pity the girl who have big breast. Mine are small and I'm so grateful for it. It's weird that family members of yours stares enough to notice you don't wear one under a hoodie.", "NTA. If they are sexualizing anything about you it's their problem. I have many cousins and we've seen each other in various states of dress. It's not a big deal.  You were literally covered up so sounds like your uncle and cousin are just creepy.", "NTA- why are men not wearing cups then? What if they get hard? That\u2019s inappropriate\u2026", "If you do not like or cannot respect the rules of someone else\u2019s house, you should go home. Your cousin told you what the practice is at her house and you chose to do what you want it.", "You are NOT in Your home. You fail to 'read the room'. Your free moving boobs may not bother you BUT they bother other family members, both male & female. Be respectful. Wear a sports bra & stop creating drama unnecessarily.", "YTA. Only because you were a guest in someone else's home and they told you that your actions were making them visibly uncomfortable. There was an easy solve but you chose to be defiant. Yes they could change their views but the same way you appreciate being comfortable in your home with your family is the way they wanted to be comfortable in theirs.", "NTA. \n\nYou have authority over what you do or don\u2019t wear. Regardless of breast size or whatever else. Then sexualizing you and getting crass is THEIR problem that they need to grow up And take responsibility for. Screw modesty culture.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re walking around naked, or even topless. You\u2019re doing nothing wrong. If your uncle and cousin can\u2019t stop looking at your chest, that\u2019s their problem, not yours. It\u2019s disgusting they would look at female family members like that. \n\nWomen have been conforming to beauty standards since the beginning of time, and bras are a part of that. Bras offer no health benefits, and in fact, some research shows wearing bras may adversely affect breast tissue (there\u2019s not much research about this, so don\u2019t take this as saying they\u2019re bad for your health). There\u2019s no real reason to ever force someone else to wear a bra.

Bras are optional articles of clothing that no one is obligated to wear, ever. \u201cTheir house, their rules\u201d simply does not apply.", "NTA. It's on your uncle and cousin to pretend not to notice you weren't wearing a bra. Openly admitting that they did notice is gross and they should know better.", "NTA. You\u2019re covered up.

I'd laugh in their faces and tell them to get over themselves if they said that to me.", "NTA", "I'd totally be on your side if this happened in public or at your home, but it's their house, their rules. You're not an AH for not wearing a bra - and I honestly think that it's strange that your uncle and cousin get weird around braless women, especially *their own family* (given that your aunt and female cousin apparently wear bras all the time) - but you're an AH for not following their house rules. \n\nIf I were you, I would wear that bra now and never stay over again.", "NTA and it\u2019s creepy that your family members were looking at your titties like that. I rarely wore a bra around the house when my dad was alive and I can\u2019t imagine having to cover up because, he\u2019s my family, why would he be uncomfortable with it? Why would he be looking?? Weirdos, looking at their family members breast.", "YTA you're a guest in their house and you're making them uncomfortable.

Well hell, so much for compromise.", "ESH, this is just kinda weird. Why would you get undressed in someone else's house, even if you were staying over?

Yesterday I went to my uncles house for a stay over. once I arrived to the house, I took off my bra as usual and just started to get comfortable. at dinner time, I noticed my uncle and male causin acting a bit weird around me, and my aunt and female cousin were giving me looks I couldn't tell what for. after dinner, my female cousin pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't wearing a bra. I told her because we are in the house. She told me that my uncle and her brother was in the house too. I got confused and told her so what, I also have a dad and brother at my house, they never cared if I wore a bra or not in the house. she got annoyed and told me to wear it and that I can take it off before sleep and to put it back on once I wake up. I refused and told her I was not going to spend the whole day in my bra. she told me she and her mom does and that I'm being dramatic. I said no again, walked out her room and basically spent the whole night in the guest room where I was gonna sleep. now its morning as I'm writing this, I'm not wearing a bra and both my cousin and aunt gave me annoyed looks and a forced good morning when I said good morning to them. Now I feel a little guilty. Should I just wear the bra? AITA for not?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We found out later they only accept female travelers, go figure. \n\n\nAnyways, after a few days they told us to get on our workout clothes we were going to his nearby vinyard to harvest grapes. They said it was just going to be for a day and it was right down the road so we didn\u2019t need to bring anything. Then after we harvested all day, we went to an \u201calmond farm\u201d that was another property he owned. And a Kurdish family lived there and upkeeps it. It wasn\u2019t really any more of a farm than the other place was a village, there was just some almond trees that they\u2019d sort of harvest from and crack open with rocks. Like there wasn\u2019t a single nutcracker on this \u201cfarm.\u201d Then they just ditched us there for three nights, hung out for a little bit then drove off without saying anything. I would pester the teenager to give me his phone every day and call the people who left us there and yell at them, and they\u2019d all be like \u201csorry, not my problem, we have other stuff to do.\u201d \n\n\nThey finally sent one of their domestic workers to pick us up on the same day I was planning on hitchhiking out of there. I know it sounds bad, but going with him was still the better option compared to hitching with no passport or wallet in a tank top and shorts in rural Turkey. When we got there, the guys who had ditched us had all left so I didn\u2019t get to yell at them.

Long answer read below:\n\n As Muslims we are not really supposed to draw any living creature as making a portrait of an animal or person is too akin to trying to be like God. This is why there are no pictural representations of the Prophet or Allah, all Islamic art is usually very geometric or involves designing gardens, there is no universal  symbol for Muslims ( the crescent is used often but its a later adoption and not everyone uses it) and so on. Art is very respected but making art about animals is disrepectful. This is why we don't wear clothes with animals or people on them because we are not allowed to pray with them.\n\nThere is also a whole other issue with iconography and idolatry and thus shirk but those are deep theological stuff but put simply we don't people or animals because some idiots might decide to worship them and God does not like that.\n\nOf course in this day and age this is really hard to enforce. Everyone has a camera in their phone so is taking a photo allowed or not? Is drawing plants bad? How do you find plain clothes for children? Is most media by its very existence sinful? If a cartoon teaches you to be a good person is it allowed or not? \n\nAs Islam is a very individualistic religion it really comes down to the person. Fundamentally we follow a book of poetry we believe was written directly by [God.](https://God.It) It is the duty of every Muslim to read the book, understand it and interpret it in a way that connects them to God. Muslims don't have a central  church like structure or like pope figure, there are multiple schools of thought that follow different interpretations and within those schools you may have some religious scholars. You may choose to follow a school of though, a variation of different schools or develop your own personal interpretation. It is directly between you and God with no middleman. So you decide on these questions yourself. Even within the same family there is no guarantee that everyone is following the same interpretation and  all children under 7 are exempt from this.\n\nI'm wearing a snoopy shirt right now and my kid has a shirt with dinosaurs on but when I pray I will change and if I decide to attend a religious ceremony or go to the mosque I'll make sure that my clothes are either plain or have a geometric pattern.

A women in one of my classes didn\u2019t wear a bra, no biggie, but would also wear really sheer shirts with massively low holes for her arms which meant when I looked up from my desk to the prof/board there was full on naked boob in my peripherals (we had set seats and she sat one row ahead and to the side of me). Which like I don\u2019t care, but it\u2019s not something that you are used to seeing in class but whatever, I managed to get through it just fine. Now that I\u2019m older and did the whole breast feeding thing myself probably wouldn\u2019t even phase me now, and even then didn\u2019t complain or make a deal but will admit looking up to full on boob in my view line was mildly distracting. After a few weeks tho I got used to it and it didn\u2019t even register with me.  \n\nWe recently went out for hibachi and shared a table with a lovely couple with a few kids and a baby. Near the end the mom who was insanely large breasted (like as a women my god that women is a fucking super hero for lugging those things around) had to feed her baby and it was like a normal sized infant head, plate sized areola and her trying the best she could to be as unnoticeable as possible, she apparently forgot her usual cover (which even if she didn\u2019t have one no fucking big deal). Her husband ran over and threw a napkin over the top of her chest trying to be helpful but honestly it covered like 1/4 of it. The husband made a comment apologizing or something, they were obviously a bit uncomfortable probably not knowing if we were offended or not, and before I could even open my mouth my husband looked up from macking on his food oblivious to the whole thing and was like \u201cdude, don\u2019t even think twice about it, a fed baby is a well taken care of baby\u201d and we continued to share a table and converse freely with not a second thought to the fact a breast was basically on full display.
