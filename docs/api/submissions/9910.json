If massages help her pain, then they should be far down the line on areas to cut for budgetary reasons, no?", "INFO: What are you giving up to help manage month expenses?\n\nBecause although a massage might not be a cure, it can really help with the pain.   So, if you're giving up something of great benefit to your physical and mental wellbeing as well, then it's a NAH.  However, if you are expecting your wife to give up something that's a legitimate health need, while you still go to the gym or do a hobby that you like, you're absolutely the arseshole.  \n\nBased on OP's edit, YTA.

Given that this is a financial issue I\u2019d suggest that you both explore some alternatives that could be covered by your health insurance.  Physical therapists can provide ultra sound to the specific areas.  I\u2019ve had it before and found it helpful.  Massage can be very useful as it helps to relax the muscles and break up scar tissue.  As others have suggested, perhaps this is something that you can do for her.  I suffer from chronic pain issues and know that all types of treatment have associated costs.  No one can appreciate how bad it can be until they experience it.", "YTA- these massages aren't for fun, and likely there isn't a cure that will fix the problem. Telling your wife to cut back on treatment is just sending her the message \"I want you to live in X amount of pain because it's not worth the cost for you to feel better\"", "INFO: if this is purely financial why does she have to give up the massages? Can you two sit down and see if there are other costs she can cut (I see in a comment she outspends you 2:1, so I'm assuming this isn't a situation where you should look at both your finances)? Singling out the massage makes it seem like you have a problem with them specifically, I think it's more reasonable to say that her spending is getting more than what you two can support and x amount needs to come down, she can figure it out from there", "YTA.

She might also benefit more from massages from a chiropractor's office versus a spa. Those tend to be more cost effective and may be covered with your health insurance.

I understand both sides. \n\nIf she can find other pain management options, that might help with the expenses. \n\nIf she's into homeopathic options, there's a great website called \"the natural health library\", filled to the brim with more research being added. Free to make an account and access the reference materials. I've used some of the recommendations off of there for my own pain issues, and had it really improve. \n\nAnother option might be to YouTube massage techniques and try to help her at home. It'll take a lot of practice but it can be a way to save money and bond.\n\nOther than that, all I can say is I hope you both figure it out. Times are tough.

Massages might be under \"nice if you can afford it\". \n\n\nAlso, what about separating your finances? You could each have your own bank account, then a joint account you both put money into each month to pay bills from.

I think your suggestion of one massage a month is a reasonable compromise between none and 2/3 per month.", "NTA. I get why some people think you are, but I know a bit about chronic pain. There is no amount of any remedy that will cure it. It's not fair, no one is saying it is, but I know she could get a massage every day for the rest of her life and it still wouldn't help. I totally understand why she thinks it's helping and if the placebo effect is what it takes for her to feel better then I think you've been reasonable by asking her to scale back on them and not give them up completely. There are people who go without their asthma medication for financial reasons, when it literally helps them breathe. They forgo *breathing.* I think she can take one for the team and scale back on the massages. She still gets to have them and you get some financial stress lifted off your shoulders.

Look into local massage therapy schools, they may do free or deeply discounted rates for practice and assessments (may not be suitable if likely to cause more damage).

It could be worthwhile to shop around, but then you might be paying for value.\n\nNext you need to discuss budget.

They cannot be cured or solved. And self-discipline, while it is relevant, is really only useful in helping one actually do the things which make it better, like exercise (for some people), regular stretches (for some people), etc. Most people are willing to go to the massage therapist -- although I've treated patients who suffered terrible pain on my table in order to help manage their pain the rest of the time -- but there are often other things which help control the pain but which are less pleasant, and discipline can help people take action along those lines. \n\nIt can't just make them able to \"solve their pain problem,\" though.

At the end of the day it\u2019s fairly extreme if there\u2019s not enough of the budget for healthcare. Again unless OP encourages or requests her to have her hair like that, I don\u2019t see why he should be contributing.", "And this is why I\u2019m thankful I live in the UK and we have the NHS. \n\nMy brother is currently on day 25 of a hospital stay. 11 days were spent in intensive care with 1:1 observation and care 24 hours a day. He has had countless surgeries, blood transfusions and antibiotics. \n\nQuite frankly they have saved his life. And it hasn\u2019t cost anyone anything but our National Insurance contributions. The level of care he has received would have bankrupted the entire family if we lived in other countries. \n\nHealthcare is not a luxury. It is a necessity. A human right.", "I went into ketoacidosis back in September. Doctors said another day or so and I\u2019d have just gone into a coma and died. I spent a couple days vomiting up so much stomach acid that I had chemical burns in my mouth, and eventually that was mixed with partially digested blood (that had a texture like wet coffee grounds) that had dripped into my stomach from my eroding esophagus. Lost over 20 lbs in less than a week.\n\nI\u2019m not even really that afraid of dying, but *not* like that. That fucking scares me.", "I didn't say they all covered massage. I said they had to cover massage *at the same rate* that they cover any other alternative medical treatment. That means that if your policy covers acupuncture or chiropractic or naturopathy, they have to cover massage to the same degree and in the same way. \n\nIf they don't cover the other types of alternative treatment at all, they don't need to cover massage. And some policies don't, especially the catastrophic-only policies aimed at younger, healthier people who don't want to put much money into it (or, sadly, people with sucky jobs whose employers don't want to put much money into it). \n\nBut IF they cover any of those other things, then they should also cover massage. It's required under the Affordable Care Act.", "Absolutely this", ">That means that if your policy covers acupuncture or chiropractic or naturopathy, they have to cover massage to the same degree and in the same way. \n\nI don't believe this is correct.  I'm sure there are some policies that cover things this way,  but definitely not all.  We have chiropractic coverage,  but our policy specifically excludes acupuncture and massage therapy.", "So the wife out spends the husband by 2:1 and spend hundreds on hair and clothes and that\u2019s okay? He has physical therapy covered on insurance but she wants more expensive treatments- that\u2019s fine. Stop outspending the husband by 2:1 on hair and clothes?? NTA a hundred times. You\u2019re not the asshole for struggling financially- Americans man."]}
