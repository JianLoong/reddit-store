So, if you're giving up something of great benefit to your physical and mental wellbeing as well, then it's a NAH.  However, if you are expecting your wife to give up something that's a legitimate health need, while you still go to the gym or do a hobby that you like, you're absolutely the arseshole.  \n\nBased on OP's edit, YTA.

Given that this is a financial issue I\u2019d suggest that you both explore some alternatives that could be covered by your health insurance.  Physical therapists can provide ultra sound to the specific areas.  I\u2019ve had it before and found it helpful.  Massage can be very useful as it helps to relax the muscles and break up scar tissue.  As others have suggested, perhaps this is something that you can do for her.  I suffer from chronic pain issues and know that all types of treatment have associated costs.  No one can appreciate how bad it can be until they experience it.", "YTA- these massages aren't for fun, and likely there isn't a cure that will fix the problem.

Can you two sit down and see if there are other costs she can cut (I see in a comment she outspends you 2:1, so I'm assuming this isn't a situation where you should look at both your finances)? Singling out the massage makes it seem like you have a problem with them specifically, I think it's more reasonable to say that her spending is getting more than what you two can support and x amount needs to come down, she can figure it out from there", "YTA.

She might also benefit more from massages from a chiropractor's office versus a spa. Those tend to be more cost effective and may be covered with your health insurance.

Free to make an account and access the reference materials. I've used some of the recommendations off of there for my own pain issues, and had it really improve. \n\nAnother option might be to YouTube massage techniques and try to help her at home.

Massages might be under \"nice if you can afford it\". \n\n\nAlso, what about separating your finances? You could each have your own bank account, then a joint account you both put money into each month to pay bills from.

I think your suggestion of one massage a month is a reasonable compromise between none and 2/3 per month.", "NTA. I get why some people think you are, but I know a bit about chronic pain. There is no amount of any remedy that will cure it. It's not fair, no one is saying it is, but I know she could get a massage every day for the rest of her life and it still wouldn't help. I totally understand why she thinks it's helping and if the placebo effect is what it takes for her to feel better then I think you've been reasonable by asking her to scale back on them and not give them up completely. There are people who go without their asthma medication for financial reasons, when it literally helps them breathe. They forgo *breathing.* I think she can take one for the team and scale back on the massages. She still gets to have them and you get some financial stress lifted off your shoulders.

Look into local massage therapy schools, they may do free or deeply discounted rates for practice and assessments (may not be suitable if likely to cause more damage).

They cannot be cured or solved.

I know some fancy fucking people, and even they don't go to a salon every month. Like they have money to look nice because they work hard and don't have time for it kinda fancy money.\n\n$100-200 could just be once nice well made top or pair of pants, which could last years. Fuck depending on your size a good bra is $80 if you're very lucky.", "True pain isn't a discipline issue, however spending $300+ a month on clothes and hair is a discipline issue.

I have chronic pain from herniated discs and pinched nerves and at my physical therapist he also does dry needling and it relieves pain within 10minutes. Its targeted and can be done before or after the exercises and actually made the PT time more valuable. I\u2019ve been in PT 3-6mo a year every year for the last decade+ and I did this for 8weeks only and I feel better than I have is many years.

That part I feel for him on.", "Physical therapy and massage therapy are two different things and help in different ways. Based on his comments, it sounds like the massage therapy also helps her pain more than the physical therapy does, so it isn\u2019t quite as simple as she just \u201cwants massages that are more expensive\u201d. However, I do agree that pain management should be more of a financial priority than hair or clothing.\n\nEdited to add: There\u2019s something about the way that OP referred to his wife\u2019s pain issues as a \u201clack of discipline\u201d and her medical issues as \u201cdubious emergencies\u201d that really doesn\u2019t sit well with me. If the issue was simply that he wanted her to spend less on clothing or hair to pay for medical, I get it, but that\u2019s not what he\u2019s saying.

I tweaked my back at my first job in HS. I didnt think it was that bad the day I did it, but when I got up to go to school the next day I essentially collapsed. My back hurt so bad I couldn't stand. For 2 years I went to a chiropractor (which had a massage before the adjustment) and never saw permanent relief. Eventually i learned to live with it until I tweaked my back again freshman year of college. 2 ER visits where they were convinced I had kidney stones, and a prescription for muscle relaxers later and my back has been great ever since. All that to say the massages and chiropractor visits were a total waste of money. They made me feel better for a few days and then it was right back to misery.", "NAH... this is less about massage and more about a lack of a budget plan.

Your wife has chronic pain, but that doesn\u2019t mean she is beyond reproach.

Massage is similar to physiotherapy and both are often used together to help with stuff like this.

Let me translate: \"Hey honey this isn't a cure so your comfort isn't worth the money\"", "You\u2019ve got two hands, you can massage her for free. WTF. YTA.

Can you get a book from the library or take classes to give her massages?", "Yta by the way you are communicating. Your issue is cost but you focus on her getting massages bc you see that as a luxury -  but not her $300/month haircut. I get my haircut like 2x per year so this to me is a much better place for cost reduction. Also you don\u2019t need new clothes 1-200 per month. Cut back on both of those that\u2019s 400-500 a month. \n\nAlso agree on insurance possibly.

You are adults, you are on the same team, don't make it into a contest.\n\nIf it was me, I would absolutely put her pain management high on the priority list.
