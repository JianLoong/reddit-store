So, if you're giving up something of great benefit to your physical and mental wellbeing as well, then it's a NAH.  However, if you are expecting your wife to give up something that's a legitimate health need, while you still go to the gym or do a hobby that you like, you're absolutely the arseshole.  \n\nBased on OP's edit, YTA.

Given that this is a financial issue I\u2019d suggest that you both explore some alternatives that could be covered by your health insurance.  Physical therapists can provide ultra sound to the specific areas.  I\u2019ve had it before and found it helpful.  Massage can be very useful as it helps to relax the muscles and break up scar tissue.  As others have suggested, perhaps this is something that you can do for her.  I suffer from chronic pain issues and know that all types of treatment have associated costs.  No one can appreciate how bad it can be until they experience it.", "YTA- these massages aren't for fun, and likely there isn't a cure that will fix the problem.

Can you two sit down and see if there are other costs she can cut (I see in a comment she outspends you 2:1, so I'm assuming this isn't a situation where you should look at both your finances)? Singling out the massage makes it seem like you have a problem with them specifically, I think it's more reasonable to say that her spending is getting more than what you two can support and x amount needs to come down, she can figure it out from there", "YTA.

She might also benefit more from massages from a chiropractor's office versus a spa. Those tend to be more cost effective and may be covered with your health insurance.

Free to make an account and access the reference materials. I've used some of the recommendations off of there for my own pain issues, and had it really improve. \n\nAnother option might be to YouTube massage techniques and try to help her at home.

Massages might be under \"nice if you can afford it\". \n\n\nAlso, what about separating your finances? You could each have your own bank account, then a joint account you both put money into each month to pay bills from.

I think your suggestion of one massage a month is a reasonable compromise between none and 2/3 per month.", "NTA. I get why some people think you are, but I know a bit about chronic pain. There is no amount of any remedy that will cure it. It's not fair, no one is saying it is, but I know she could get a massage every day for the rest of her life and it still wouldn't help. I totally understand why she thinks it's helping and if the placebo effect is what it takes for her to feel better then I think you've been reasonable by asking her to scale back on them and not give them up completely. There are people who go without their asthma medication for financial reasons, when it literally helps them breathe. They forgo *breathing.* I think she can take one for the team and scale back on the massages. She still gets to have them and you get some financial stress lifted off your shoulders.

Look into local massage therapy schools, they may do free or deeply discounted rates for practice and assessments (may not be suitable if likely to cause more damage).

They cannot be cured or solved.

I\u2019m also a [T1.5 LADA diabetic.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes_in_adults) I was originally dx (diagnosed) as T2 but four years ago my pancreas died; I\u2019m fully insulin dependent now.\n\nPain patients in the US are in a really tenuous situation right now. Due to overprescribing and abuse (two distinct issues) most chronic pain patients in this country are no longer maintained on narcotic pain medications.\n\nThere is no surgical answer to my chronic pain, although it has been well-documented, I won my Social Security disability case, and I have appropriate evidence (MRIs, X-rays); I have always been in compliance with my morphine (UAs, pill counts).\n\nDespite these factors, my doctor\u2019s practice decided they would no longer write me for pain meds. The same is true for almost every other practice in my state. Even cancer patients and surgical patients are having difficulty obtaining appropriate pain management. \n\nIt\u2019s my opinion that pain patients are being punished bc of the fentanyl overdoses in this country but that\u2019s a separate topic. Please see [Don\u2019t Punish Pain.](https://dontpunishpainrally.com)\n\nWhen I was tapered off my morphine (incorrectly, I might add), I was so constantly dopesick that I went cold turkey and gave my remaining pain meds to a friend who couldn\u2019t get enough coverage for his psoriatic arthritis.\n\nI have since done exactly what OP\u2019s wife has done: cobbled together an assortment of treatments in order to remain as functional as possible. I can\u2019t speak to private insurance but the list of things Medicare/Medicaid (state insurance) won\u2019t cover is many times longer than what they will.\n\nGenerally speaking Medicaid will cover surgery, prescriptions, and a limited number of physical therapy appointments. They do not cover: massage, yoga, acupuncture, other types of body work, education in lifestyle changes, education in dietary changes, help losing weight, cannabis, CBD cream, ongoing physical therapy, or ongoing counseling for living with chronic pain.\n\nBroadly speaking, the medical community here now recommends that chronic pain be managed with lifestyle changes. That\u2019s no substitute for pain medication, obviously. But even people who want to try lifestyle changes don\u2019t receive any support from Medicare/Medicaid and none of those tools are covered. They are simply out of luck.\n\nIf anyone is curious I now take kratom to manage my pain. It literally saved my life. I\u2019m in a legal cannabis state but the only good results I got (from a variety of cannabis products) was some relief from using CBD salve to treat trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious why I suffer from trigeminal neuralgia it\u2019s bc I had over three years of constant, painful shingles outbreaks and was left with nerve damage in my face. The reason the outbreaks went on so long is bc I was under the age covered by Medicaid for a shingles vaccine even though I was already suffering shingles outbreaks. This is another example of the American healthcare system in action.\n\nOn to the comments bickering about diabetes coverage. Four years ago my pancreas died, I ended up in [DKA, and was in a coma for three days.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis) I spent ten days in the hospital where it was determined my diabetes was autoimmune in origin and I would be insulin dependent for the rest of my life.\n\nFrom the moment I returned home I had difficulty getting Medicaid to pay for my insulin. I was terrified bc I had very nearly died from lack of insulin and didn\u2019t want to go through that experience ever again.\n\nThe issue, evidently, is that Medicaid had in its records that I was originally (mis)diagnosed as a T2. So they believed that insulin was somehow \u201coptional\u201d for me. My doctor\u2019s office and the insurance went back and forth over it for almost a year. And I learned to do what diabetics in this country do: ration insulin, use syringes to scavenge the remaining droplets in old insulin pens, borrow from people who have private insurance, and post on the diabetes subreddits asking for help.\n\nThree absolute strangers mailed me insulin from their stockpiles and that got me through for a while. We finally reached an impasse with Medicaid when they agreed to cover insulin for 28 days of every month. It was at that point that my doctor snapped and started to falsify the amount of insulin I needed so I would have enough to 1) not die and 2) start building a stockpile of my own. \n\nEven that is not a great solution. If I were to, God forbid, end up arriving at a hospital unconscious ever again my records would indicate I\u2019m taking much higher doses of insulin than I actually need. That\u2019s a pretty dangerous situation tbh.\n\nI also turned out to have a little something called hypoglycemic unawareness. I\u2019m prone to erratic highs and lows with my blood sugars and hypoglycemic unawareness means that I don\u2019t feel myself dropping dangerously low. The remedy to that is CGL (continuous glucose monitor) but Medicaid won\u2019t cover the monitor or (prohibitively expensive) sensors.\n\nI fought another year for the CGL before getting my congressman involved. He made one phone call and Medicaid did a complete about face. Because that\u2019s the way things work here. Corporations are people, people are expendable, and a local politician can get me supplies that my doctor can not.\n\nIf you\u2019re still with me, God bless you.\n\nNow, is OP the AH? I don\u2019t know. But I do firmly agree that, if finances are causing his family to cut corners, they should cut anything and everything before giving up on his wife\u2019s massages. They are therapeutic, they are pain management, and she is dependent on them to maintain her quality of life.\n\nThat\u2019s really important. Almost all chronic pain patients also end up with chronic depression. That\u2019s bc the chemicals in your brain that stabilize mood are constantly depleted from managing physical pain. That\u2019s right, TL; DR: physical pain = emotional pain. It\u2019s all processed in the same place and should be treated in every way possible.\n\nThank you for hearing what I have to say. I hope some of my reddit posts will be helpful to people and perhaps even serve as my legacy. Because after March 1 I will be homeless. I receive almost $900/month from Social Security; that\u2019s my entire income and well below the poverty level.

Couple of suggestions to manage pain and expenses:\n\nTake a massage class if you can find one in your area.

If you learn how to do it properly, you can save money while giving your wife some relief more often than a few times a month.\n\nYou can also purchase a massage gun or other device to help provide relief on a more regular basis.\n\nHeat always helps my aches and pains, but most don\u2019t work well for the neck. The best thing I have found is also super easy. Fill a sock with uncooked white rice and tie the end in a knot. Microwave 1-2 minutes for 10-20 minutes of heat. The sock conforms to the neck better than any heating pad.\n\nHope those help you out a bit. If she\u2019s still in a lot of pain, look into seeing a rheumatologist.

I'd also be asking why she is needing more often - is pain worsening (it can be weather or stress-related - stress makes you tense up and that can aggevate old injuries so not all in mind) or does she need to see a doctor?

She overspends drastically and contributes to his negative opinion of her.", "Appreciate it :)", "In the US, massage is far cheaper than doctor\u2019s visits, so if they can\u2019t even afford massage, going to a doctor is probably not practical.", "What on earth has this got to do with OP. You're comparing one of the most horrendous medical conditions (hence the nickname suicide headache) to severe back issues. Ever heard of suicide backache? Their not even remotely comparable. \n\nThat's not to dismiss OP's wife, but it all depends on their budget. If their struggling to put food on the table, then yes massages are a luxury they sadly cannot afford.", "Do you always make stuff up when you\u2019re being dramatic? I think you were trying to refer to trigeminal autonomic celphalgias. More commonly called \u201ccluster headaches.\u201d While they are sometimes referred to as \u201csuicide headaches,\u201d the term is far from commonly used in healthcare. Your references to people \u201cpretty often\u201d committing suicide do not represent medical causation. Maybe provide a reference? Same for the migraines as a \u201cmost painful condition\u201d. I tried to look that up, but obviously that\u2019s pretty impossible to determine, so the lists were a bit laughable. Certainly not something that would even be discussed seriously in healthcare.\n\nIn one comment, you\u2019ve exaggerated, misrepresented, flat out lied, and made claims without a source. How could anyone read this and take your complaints seriously?", "YTA.\n\nNo, they're not a cure - what the hell IS? She needs to manage her pain, which is probably considerable. You could show her a little more empathy.", "YTA, learn how to give a massage if you are so worried about the money.

Do you have access to a flex spending account? I would suggest getting one of those (too late for this year, but next year). You can pay for massages with that. Soft Yta because, while it is a complete rip off, is it the only thing that helps her? Obviously it\u2019s not a cure, but does it give her relief?", "YTA. Advil isn\u2019t a cure for a headache but it\u2019s sure nice when it temporarily makes you feel better, right? Even if the pain comes back because it\u2019s a migraine that lasts three days, you\u2019re so happy with the Advil kicks in, right? \n\nYou\u2019re telling your wife she must exist in constant pain because the relief she gets will just be temporary. But temporary relief is better than no relief.\n\nInfo: why do you want your wife to physically suffer?", "Alot of insurance companies will cover massage if it's a doctor referral.", "YTA- why don\u2019t you learn how to give massages and then do them for free? \n\n#justamassage", "I can see both sides, massages are expensive, but also it may be one of the only things that gives her relief. I have chronic pain off and on, and the only alternate I've found for deep tissue massage is this specific shiatsu massager (others are too weak and/or break). I'm on my 3rd one of these in 10 years, and it costs less than the price of a massage. It might be a good option as a supplemental item to help her go longer between massages while still managing the pain.\n\nZyllion Shiatsu Back and Neck Massager - 3D Kneading Deep Tissue Massage Pillow with Heat for Muscle Pain Relief https://a.co/d/4RPG7Hn", "well  light yta, and put in balance cost of massages and her salary... because thats where will end up, with her not being able to work anymore, either physically either psychological she will burn up and will no longer be able to work....", "https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/how-to-get-medical-insurance-to-cover-massage-therapy", "Huuuuge difference between insulin and a massage dude.", "Name a country who's healthcare coveres massage visits.", "I also have severe fibromyalgia as well as chronic migraines. I completely disagree with you. I would really benefit from having massages multiple times per month, but guess what? I can\u2019t have them because I can\u2019t afford them.\n\nYes, OP needs to understand that pain management is important. There\u2019s no cure for chronic pain, but managing it is very important. However, if OP\u2019s family is going without necessities because of his wife\u2019s massages, she needs to find another way to manage her pain. It really sucks that that\u2019s the case, but in the real world, sometimes you just have to figure out an alternative to the ideal.", "If you believe that people rationing their medications is ok in any form.

It's done out of necessity and desperation because they can't afford their needs.", "Maybe I misread, but it seems like the financial burden the massages are causing the family is the only reason OP is asking her to cut down? How does that make him an asshole? He isn't treating it like she's doing it for shits and giggles, just acknowledged we can't afford to keep doing this at this rate which seems valid. It's a shame they can't afford it and it's a bigger shame there isn't any kind of coverage and this woman has to make the choice to live in pain or maybe not be able to pay other bills. That's not treating healthcare and pain management as a luxury, that's just the shitty reality of the situation.", "I've been wearing the same pairs of lucky jeans from Marshalls i picked up for $30-40 like 5-8 years ago. Recently bought more and they are like $60 now.\n\nI'd say you're not looking in the wrong place.", "According to his comments, the massages aren't such a burden that they'll starve or be homeless if they continue...it's just that they aren't socking away savings the way OP thinks they should be.  Nor do they have an actual budget to see if this is their only economizing option.  Having experienced sciatica, I can tell you that chronic pain is debilitating.  It can weaken your immune system, it affects your mood, your sleep and your quality of life.  Even a couple of days pain-free is like a gift from the gods.  So yeah, I think OP is def TA", "Thank you for commenting this. \n\nBut really, as the top comment says, this really highlights ways that healthcare sucks in the US.

On good months, all the different cards you stacked up into a house (massage, chiropractor, TENS, theracane, medication, yoga, etc.) balance well enough that your house doesn't collapse. If your pain can't be completely rehabilitated (so, something like fibromyalgia, MS, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome with hyper mobility), then all you can do is treat the symptoms as they appear and seek temporary relief. \n\nFor OP's wife, a big part of her pain management program involves massage. That's a valid treatment for symptoms and, in many cases, the most effective one. OP is asking his wife to go without or cut down on her medical treatment. Unless their finances are truly dire that's not a reasonable ask. \n\nOP, gently: you're the asshole. Sit down with your wife and figure out the budget."]}
