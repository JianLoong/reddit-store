Like he can\u2019t even make the bare minimum effort while you\u2019ve had a lot more invasive procedures done. And if you did explore other options like IVF, those are a lot of work too.\n\nLike how would he be raising kids?\n\nHe\u2019s free to decide if it\u2019s a dealbreaker or not", "NTA. All he needs to do is pee and jizz into two separate cups. If he can\u2019t find the time to do two things that he probably does daily, then how is he going to find time to raise a kid?", "NTA. Your husband is throwing up a ton of red flags here. He makes absolutely _zero_ effort for 6 months to do a basic task, then becomes \u201cirate\u201d when you make a very level-headed and reasonable conclusion? \n\nThe silver lining: you are dodging a bullet by not having a kid with this man.", "If you're done, you're done. You have given it a good try. NTA. Plenty of couples have survived the realization that children weren't going to happen for them.\n\nI'm an adoptee; my own parents went through this.", "If he's this bad at supporting you during conception, he's not going to magically get any better once kids actually arrive. NTA.", "NTA, you've done the right thing, kids are a big choice for a couple and when one person doesn't want or cannot have kids, it changes a lot, you're aware of that and let him know you understand that, so that option to leave isn't one you would fight, that's simply something that shows your understanding of the situation and care for your husband's future and priorities. \n\nAlso, just FYI, as someone who went through infertility, similar testing to what you're likely going through, followed by IVF, you need a partner who is going to be just as involved as you are. Yes most of the test, potential operations/procedures and treatment will fall on you, that doesn't mean your partner gets to check out and not show their support and do their part in the process. \nHis inability to do the simple tests that are required of him now, says a lot about the road ahead if you did pursue children with him.", "NTA, you are being an adult.\n\nHe has a know medical issue, I suspect, that he doesn't want you to know, regarding his sperm. Otherwise he would get that done. Either that or he doesn't want kids either but he wants to pin it on you.\n\nAnyways, I like you. You are so strong and responsible. I have never been, but I am more so now as a parent, something I absolutely did not plan (to begin with) but love being now. Being child free, voluntarily or involuntarily, is just as good as being a parent. We all have worth and value. If he wants kids that are biologically his, he should move on. You don't want to get pregnant, that is just fine. \n\nGood luck with everything.", "If he truly wanted kids he would have jumped to get his tests done before your long list of tests. Now it is excuses.\n\nYour life plans have diverged...it is a mature thing to offer the out now while he could still have kids or do something else. If you want to save this marriage and go childless like others, you may need marriage counseling to come to terms with a new life plan. Otherwise walking away is OK too if you both agree.", "NTA. It seems like you're fully dedicated, yet your husband hasn't done a simple test, which doesn't seem very supportive. I can understand that you might be feeling alone in this, and that's tough. Wanting kids is one thing, but actions really count, especially considering your past miscarriages. At the moment, the effort seems quite minimal, and expressing the desire to have children is just not enough. If you haven\u2019t had a serious calm conversation, I think it\u2019s time. Sharing your perspective, feelings, and the challenges you're facing could bring you closer, especially if the idea of him leaving was mentioned in the heat of the moment (which we don\u2019t know if that was the case)", "Your husband not putting the efforts is a bit strange.", "nope, nta, hubs needs to be realistic", "NTA.You've already gone through alot medically to attempt to have a child and he hasn't done the bare minimum that's been asked of him. Perfectly reasonable for you to be hesitant, or not willing at all (I certainly would be) to undergo more treatment for something that might not work.\n\nAlso one might look at this as a character test. You did all this, he did nothing. What happens in the future if there's a dire life emergency?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: missing word", "NTA.

His reaction seems dramatic and childish. However his lack of effort in getting simple tests done does not sound like the actions of a mature responsible man either.", "NTA because it is your choice whether or not to have kids- but I kind of hope that\u2019s not how you told him. You make it sound like you said \u201cI\u2019m not having kids. If you don\u2019t like that, leave.\u201d It makes it sound like you think he only cares about your desire to have children and that you don\u2019t care about him much if you are able to offer up an ultimatum like that. \n\nI would also want to know the real reason he doesn\u2019t want to get his sample done. Is he afraid he is infertile and it\u2019s messing with his head? The \u201cget rid of him\u201d comment seems like it is coming from somewhere.", "NTA. I struggled through infertility for 2.5yrs. Mine wasn't too severe in comparison to IVF, miscarriages, still births, etc. I can understand your change in my about wanting kids. It's alot to go through. We have stopped at one because it was too hard mentally. I think you're being very mature by giving your husband a way out if he doesn't want the same future as you.", "NTA, he is projecting. He wants out but doesn't have the balls to tell you so he is angry that you are doing what is necessary. Never give yourself the blame for not wanting kids, I always wanted kids too, but at 35 I had a massive uterus operation, I am still fertile, but I am just able to become a mom via c-section and I needed almost a year recovering from this big operation and I don't want to do that again. I am 40 now, too, so a little old for kids anyhow. You need to be serious with him, tell him if he doesn't do any of the tests necessary within the next three months, you will leave him and set him free because he doesn't want to make the effort to have a kid. If he doesn't want to have kids either, he needs to tell you, then you can talk about your future.", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We had always talked about wanting kids and wanting 3 or 4. About 2yrs ago I stopped my birth control and we decided to start trying. After a year and a half with no success we went and saw a specialist who told me that I had a few different medical conditions that would make getting pregnant very difficult, but not impossible and I would need to start treatment asap.  I ended up having labs draw that included 18 vials of blood, ultrasound, hysto, and a procedure to remove a piece of my uterus. My husband would only need to submit a urine and semen sample and I could not start treatments until both of us completed the testing. It has been over 6months and he still has not done the lab work and if I bring it up he gets very defensive and tells me he just doesnt have the time. The lab is open 7days a week 12hrs a day. He works 4a-12p most days and has regular days off.  Ive really spent this time thinking about what I want and even his labs come back perfect there is long road ahead full of pills, more surgeries, possibly IVF, hormone injections, ect. Im no longer sure that having children is the best option for my mental and physical well being. I miscarried a few times with my last partner and I dont know if can go through that again. I told my husband that I longer wanted to have kids, but that I could not make that choice for him because I knew he always wanted them. I told him, he really needed to think about if he wanted to continue in this marriage now that our life goals no longer matched up. He became irate and told me that I was just looking for a way to \u201cGet rid of him\u201d. This is not the case, I love my husband with my whole heart and it would kill me to end things but I do not want him to resent me down the line when he realizes that I really can not going to give him the children he always wanted. So am I the asshole for telling my husband I dont want to have kids and he is free to leave?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is a long and difficult road ahead and if he is not cooperating in the slightest at this very early stage where he has to just do one small thing, you're going to end up so frustrated and angry trying to lug it uphill all alone.", "NTA. Your husband is awful though. Either he is scared he is infertile or doesn\u2019t want to face the reality and so avoids the labs like he plaque. He tried to put blame on you for simply stating something that you no longer want. Despite your love, this man is a bunch of red flags from this post alone, I would seriously reconsider your relationship.", "Honestly I don\u2019t feel like your husband is acting like someone who really wants to have children. Maybe the conversation needs to start with figuring out how important that is to either one of you. You\u2019re NTA, his actions have been kinda passive aggressive until he expressed his anger. Could it be that children aren\u2019t as important to him as they once were and now he\u2019s afraid that you seem willing to part with him over this?\n\nThere could be a lot more going on here, but I think a real heart to heart is necessary before making any assumptions. I\u2019d love to hear an update if you do have a conversation about it.", "NTA this is absolutely fair from your side to offer him to leave to fulfill his life goals. Kids ARE a deal-breaker.\n\nAbout his behaviour about testing? I would bet that he doesn't want to do it because he is afraid that his sperm might also be not working. As long as he doesn't know you are the bad guy. Once he knows, he can't put all the blame on you alone plus leaving you would also not help because he can't produce kids.", "You've already come to this conclusion but let me just reiterate: do not, under any circumstances, have kids with someone like this. You will have two toddlers to shepherd through life with no help, instead of just the one you have now.", "Something tells me he already knows what the lab results will be.

He says he wants kids but won\u2019t even put in the (minimal) work to determine his own fertility.\n\nYou\u2019re right. If the two of you are determined to have a biological child together it will be probably be an uphill battle and there will be disappointments. Surviving that as a couple requires full commitment from both partners.

He should either agree to end the marriage or stand by you as you are.", "Question: Is it the process of you physically having children that you no longer want or just kids in general? \n\nBecause there are other options, like adoption that would not include you giving birth, no miscarriage on your part and no more treatments for you either. \n\nBut being honest with you partner is never an AH move, in my opinion.", "You're NTA but I feel more extensive communication here is in order.\nYou still love this man - tell him that. Say that you don't want to get pregnant anymore with all that would imply. Say that it seems like kids are not written in your future and you have reconciled with that idea (though if you were willing to go through all of this, adoption may have been an option?).\nThen see what he says. Remind him that you had agreed you did want kids, and you changing the terms of the agreement does mean he has to make the choice, and you are reconciled with that too. If he stays, he has to be ok being a family without kids.\nThis way he can't accuse you of trying to break up with him, because you don't actually mention him leaving.", "NTA let him leave.", "I'm a bit confused. You have every right to change your mind about kids, but once you have such a thought you go to your husband and tell him he should consider to leave you? Am i correct? \nHaven't you uh just talk about still being a family with no kids? \n\nPS your husband still the AH to continue postpone his labs", "INFO: Why can't you adopt?", "I'll get downvoted for this but ESH.\nObviously your husband not putting effort into it is an AH move, especially with how hard youre working to get your side of things done.\n\nHowever, you do want to leave your husband and you're lying to yourself. I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that most things end up like this \"I've been asking for 6 months but I can't get him to do ___\"\n\n\nWhy has there not been a single mention of adopting? Or surrogacy? If you really really want this to workout and the issue is fertility why not *try something else??*", "This will be a hot take now but in some case, YTA.\n\nAt first let me clarify, I am absolutely on anyone else's side here regarding the effort your husband takes to submit his medicals and also that it's your body and obviously a whole lot of medication so you should decide if you want to have kids or not. No doubts about that.\n\nNow to the YTA part.\nDid you two got together for a longer conversation about this topic, where you explained all of your points to not have kids AND told him, despite loving him with all  your heart, you could understand if he wants to part ways? Because how you write things it sounds like it was a rather quick convo without you giving him all the mentioned details. If so, I can absolutely understand him getting irate about it.\nThe end sounds kinda like a \"I won't get kids, if you're not fine with it go and I won't stop you\".\nI would be mad if my missus told it to me like this too.\nNot even because you don't want kids but because you make it sound like you can easily abandon him. \n\nLike I said, hot take and I hope you can understand, where I'm coming from.\n\nBTW, English is only my third language so excuse my mistakes here pls.", "It sounds to me like you're deciding for him what he wants, and that might make YTA. He's clearly not that eager to have kids if he's not even willing to do that simple test. Just be happy together without kids.\n\nOf course if he really does want kids but isn't willing to do anything for it, then he's living in a fantasy world and not suited to raise kids at all.", "NTA you went through a lot of invasive procedures and previous trauma which has led you to make this huge decision. It sounds well thought through and you respected your husband by giving him the option to leave if his life goals don\u2019t align with yours. Personally, someone who can\u2019t even make a small effort to start the baby making process when you\u2019ve literally endured so much trauma doesn\u2019t bode well as someone who will take 50% responsibility for childcare.", "NTA he\u2019s not even willing to do a couple of non invasive tests. He doesn\u2019t seem committed to having kids either.", "My first thought is that it sounds like you've made the right decision for you. He hasn't been checked out which says a lot and If he kicks up a stink I'd have to question whether he might have changed his mind also. Delaying getting tested says so much. Be honest with each other. Truly deeply honest.", "NTA. \n\nHaving had fertility battles that sound a little similar with husband putting things on the back burner I would highly recommend seeing a fertility counsellor / couples counsellor together. His reluctance may be a result of him \u201cfreezing\u201d due to emotion he can\u2019t deal with. \nLeaving a marriage - or going straight to that as an option - without discussion is black and white thinking. You love each other. Communicate and talk to each other; it\u2019s hard but it\u2019s so worth it.", "NTA.\n\nGood luck, bud.", "\"Yes husband, I developed a medical contidion on purpouse just to get rid of you\"\n\nNTA...", "NTA\n\nYou didn't tell him to leave, you told him that your priorities have changed based on the evidence and your physical and mental well-being. He ASSUMED you were trying to get rid of him. You approached this in the most sensitive way I could fathom, knowing what it might cost you. You were compassionate but direct and you are absolutely NTA.", "NTA but biased. I made same call and same chat with my O/H. But he didn't have the tantrum. It is a major undertaking for you to get pregnant with chance of heart break. But it is unfair to bind other to your decision and he hasn't. \n\nHowever, you may have deeper issues with your husband. He may have been avoiding testing due to issues around his verility. Children and worth aren't just a female thing. A man is proven by his fertility while a woman's worth is her children. Both absolute BS to my mind but deeply ingrained beliefs that may surprise you when they come up. Did for me when had hysterectomy. He may be scared of tests in case  \"broken\" or scared of being dumped.\n\nThis way he gets the easy out of it all being your fault. Don't let him away with that or will become recurring issue. Try couple therapy if willing. I know tough time for you but he may need reassurance too.", "Nta...idk what he's so mad about, it doesn't seem he's really interested in having kids anyway since he hasn't bothered to get the tests done in 6 freaking months. If you don't want to divorce him then just.....do nothing. He'll continue not going to get tested, eventually it'll be too late, it'll sort itself out. Don't nag him about getting tests done. He knows you can't start treatment till he does and he's not getting it done. Know what? With his reaction he may have ALREADY been thinking of divorce and feels guilty and you telling him it's ok if he wants to find someone else to have kids with made him feel worse. Idk. If the problem is you being unable to carry, you can look into a surrogate. It would be expensive, but I can't imagine it would be any more expensive that ivf, as long as your eggs are fine and his sperm is fine it would still biologically be your baby. You should talk to him tho and tell him you don't WANT to get a divorce, just that you would understand if that was what he chose and judge his reaction from that.", "NTA \n\nIf he cant be bothered to get his end checked out when its so straightforward, then he isnt that bothered about having kids either.", "What is HE not the Asshole? He does not want kids either but is not willing to face his truth", "NTA but you need to understand this is no easy conversation. There will be angry and sad moments, doubts and questions and some really stuffed up assumptions.\n\nIf there's any love, that's how it may come to the fore. And sometimes, love is absolutely all you need.\nSometimes, people need love and kids. Or they like to think that's the case. So your husband will have to figure this out on his own.\n\nSo adoption was never on the cards?", "NTA, you changed your mind about having kids, you communicated that to him. Having kids is not something you can compromise on.", "NTA OP. It is a difficult road and it often feels lonely when doing everything together. Let alone if you have no support of your partner.

You\u2019re supposed to go through a series of huge physical and emotional commitments with no guarantee of it paying off.

The way you said it in the post, in the wrong context it can sound a bit like you\u2019re just giving up on the relationship. Tell him about how you\u2019re worried about your health and whether or not you can handle it. Tell him you\u2019re upset he hasn\u2019t done the one thing that\u2019s expected of him while you gave this huge road ahead of you.

He's projecting his feelings into you because he doesn't know how to use his words, and he's already left the marriage.", "NTA. I would have a think about what you want and what the issues are though. For example, is adopting an option? No judgement but I'd explore the whole issue and understand exactly where you stand on everything.", "I had a discussion with my partner around something and felt he might decide to leave because of it. I mentioned this to him when we originally had the conversation, basically saying that I would understand if he decided not to be with me anymore. When we spoke about it some months later, he said that he'd felt really hurt that I said that and that he felt like I didn't love him enough to work on the relationship despite what had happened. From my side, I was trying to alleviate guilt and let him know that whatever he decided, I wouldn't try to change his mind and would accept his decision as it was his to make. \n\nI think the way you said it might have been insensitive, but it also feels like his response was super insecure and quite manipulative.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, when considering it as a whole, you are NTA. You've put yourself through an enormously strenuous and uncomfortable process and changing your mind on something like this and communicating that to him, is a kindness and incredibly respectful and considerate of what he wants and gives him the space to decide without basing that decision on  how the consequences of it affect you.", "NTA, but your husband sure is. Can\u2019t even do the bare minimum to have a kid while you go through all that. What\u2019s he going to be like when you\u2019re pregnant or have a kid, really think about that.\n\nIs someone this lazy and unmotivated someone who deserves to have a kid/s with you?", "NTA. \n\nAside from your own reasons to not want to put your own health at risk for something which will likely take years and possibly not even work, do you even want children with a man who can\u2019t be bothered to piss and jerk into two cups? \n\nTo try for children you have a long, painful road ahead of you. Your husband has shown you he isn\u2019t available to join you on this burdensome journey. \n\nThat\u2019s all you need to know. \n\nYou are more that reasonable to tell your husband it\u2019s now off the cards. \n\nHis reaction is odd. Considering his total lack of effort. I think perhaps he does want children but he does not want the work involved. This is causing conflicting emotions for him. \n\nEither way, this is a bad sign.", "NTA. I\u2019m a big believer that when it comes to kids, you both have to be 150% all in. This kind of foot dragging with just the bare minimum of testing would tell me that when you need him to show up for the rest of it you might not be able to rely on him. \n\nAlso there is no shame in realising that the process of having kids for you might be extremely medical, long and heartbreaking and that swaying you away from it. I suspect if some IVF parents knew going in what their family planning journey would be like they may not have made the same choice. It\u2019s okay for you to have changed your mind, and it\u2019s compassionate to tell him in case his wants are different.", "NTA.\n\nI doubt he really wants kids tbh. If he did, he would have submitted that sample. Maybe something happened to him mentally when everything first didn't happen, or at the doctor's one time.

Normally that would only be required when you start IVF, after fixing all the other medical issues you face with conception.\n\nWhat specific bloodwork are they looking to have him do? Testosterone and FSH are the two used to determine if hormones are in balance for regular sperm production, and a semen analysis will tell you if he has low count, motility or morphology issues. Any of the latter would mean you'd either have to go with an ICSI procedure, or look for a sperm donor.

Ultimately though, if he wants kids, he needs to take responsibility and go. \n\nMy wife also miscarried, and we went through a similar thought that we didn't want to go through it again.

The fact that he hasn't gotten tested yet suggests that maybe he is unwilling to have children at all (despite him saying he does). I think that it is a blessing in disguise that he has put it off, because you have been able to think deeper on this issue and whether it is the right thing for you to do or not. His being irate over simple, reasonable questions demonstrate a lack of maturity and I would even say a victim complex seeing as he is trying to twist the argument on you and make you seem awful.  \nAt the end of the day, the decision is YOURS to make. YOU are the one who carries the child. YOU are the one who is having invasive testing done. YOU are the one who goes through the physical changes associated with pregnancy. If you were to get pregnant and miscarry again (god forbid) you go through so much more emotional trauma because that baby was a part of you (I am not discounting the feelings of others here, I understand it would be awful for all parties involved).   \nI suggest seeking therapy, there may be deeper issues at play here, especially if he is putting off this simple test and turning the argument on you.  \nI hope this issue can be resolved, that you can both come to a peaceful conclusion and be content with whatever decision you make.", "NTA!

She's under huge pressure about this (their expectations to have kids) and i assume she may be depressed and need help to regain her mental health.  (this also might be the reason to stop treatment. I'm not saying is necessarily like that, i respect her decision)\n\nSo her lack of confidence make her think this is the end of their marriage. I'm well aware having kids is huge deal and they both wanted them, but has she talked with her husband about all this? About her feelings, about her fears, about how could they stay or not together considering the fact she might not have kids with him? What he thinks about that? \n\nMy question is - where's the husband? Was he there for her all this time? Was he supporting and caring? All we know is this thing about not getting his labs done, but maybe he's just afraid to know he also has problems. Again I'm not saying he's not the AH about that, but he can have fears just like OP. That's normal and could be dealt by simply open conversation. \n\nAll I'm trying to say there - what's with husband? How he feels? Has they talked this through? Other ppl here suggest they might also consider adopting or some other options, but this require two of them. \n\nI can't imagine what's she going through. OP, if you read this, I'm very sorry for you. Please take care whatever the outcome. \n\n(sorry for my bad English I'm not a native speaker)\n\nETA for typos", "not to mention she's even hard parts of her REMOVED over this. how her husband can't seem to see or acknowledge that is horrifying to me", "good point, since OP did get pregnant with someone else (could happen of course, and it wasn't smooth sailing, but let me say that after i finally got pregnant and had a miscarriage, the medical professionals we were working with said: \"well, at least now we know you CAN get pregnant, much as it sucks.)"]}
