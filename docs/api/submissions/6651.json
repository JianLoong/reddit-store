{"id": 6651, "submission_id": "10505s5", "title": "AITA for not wanting to also pay for my sister to come to Italy?", "selftext": "\\*please do not repost anywhere else\\*\n\nFor my mother's birthday this upcoming August, I (25f) planned to pay for her and I to take a trip to Italy in September. When I first made these plans in summer 2022, I spoke with my sister (23f) and asked if she wanted to come and she said she can't because she cannot afford it, which is totally understandable as she still lives at home with mom and works in a food retailer of sorts. I moved out in 2020 and started saving for this Italy trip after speaking with my sister. All seemed well and my mom was excited to go since it was a trip for her to a destination she always wanted to visit.\n\nCut to now. I've been making steady plans of what we will do in Italy each day and - of course - the overall cost. I was going to pay for my mom's ticket and mine as well as our hotel for the entirety of the trip. I'd also likely pay for some dinners and fun stuff while in the country. My mom wanted to bring fun money for herself to get whatever she wanted as well. However, now my mom has been talking about how my sister is upset that we are going without her and that she wants to go. I get that - I do - and if I were in her shoes I'd feel the same way. But her financial situation hasn't changed, so mom was saying she and I could split the cost for my sister to come with us. This is an absolute no to me because according to my savings plan, I should have enough for just mom and I for the plane, hotel, food, train, and an emergency. I do not have spare money to pay for my sister as well. My mom is also not doing well financially (a big reason I wanted to pay for something so extravagant for her since she likely could never afford to go) so her paying half for my sister to come was unfair in my opinion. None of us are rolling in money. We're all struggling, but I planned for just 2 people to go to Italy and saved as such. I don't think it's fair for my sister to start complaining about wanting to go now without paying her way 100%. She isn't giving any money towards the trip for mom (since it's mom's gift), so the least she can do is pay her own way at this point.\n\nThis was supposed to be a gift for my mom and I already asked my sister if she wanted to/could contribute when I first started planning this and she couldn't and I respected that. I haven't bought our flights yet (waiting until March), so I wanted to know if I was really being unreasonable wanting to spend an extra $1,000 or so for my sister to come with us when it would be dipping into my already low savings and wasn't part of my budget plan from the get-go. Please let me know because my mom is really upset with me and I feel like my sister is ruining something that was supposed to be a dream for her.\n\nEDIT: A lot of you are making this a big deal and telling me to cancel the trip, which I guess based on the post alone without reading comments/knowing more is totally fair. It\u2019s not that big a deal that I\u2019d take away this experience from my mom for being worried my sister wants to come and can\u2019t. The world isn\u2019t as black and white as that, unfortunately.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019ve texted my sister and surprisingly she said she didn\u2019t want to go. I planned to speak with her in person about this but she said via text that mom had taken something she said during the holidays out of context and thought she wanted to go when she doesn\u2019t. I asked if she would be down to plan a separate trip with the 3 of us somewhere in 2024 and she was down.

She's not realising how this could strain or damage things between you and her as well as you and your sister, because if your sister gets to go, you will probably spend the whole trip, and maybe years afterwards, resenting both your mum and sister for foisting this on you.", "NTA. \nCancel the trip. \nYour mom isn't going to appreciate your efforts now.

My sister hasn't said anything directly to me yet, but that's mainly because we don't talk often because she's always working/with her boyfriend. I wish I had the flexibility to pay for everyone - that's in a perfect world - but if I pay for my sister as well then I have to put off taking my animals to the vet/paying student loans for the first few months and I can't take that risk.", "My mom thinks that I have more money than I do since my boyfriend and I bought a home and she rents. It's not the case because my savings took a serious hit the past year and when student loan payments restart I'll be extra screwed. I think my mom just genuinely wants us all to go and thinks I can afford it and that I'm being stingy by saying no somehow", "I feel like a bitch saying it but my sister totally could afford at least half her way on this trip if she didn't spend so much on getting large tattoos lol I love tattoos a ton but I'm the one who chooses to save/spend money on bills vs. get tattoos/spend money on bills. I'm definitely more frugal, which is likely why mom thinks I can afford to pay for my sister too.", "I hope we can work it out too! I wish I could explain my sister a bit more because I feel like I made her seem evil and malicious when she really isn't. She just doesn't think before saying things and (I love her so I don't mean this cruelly) she doesn't really have the mental capacity to plan something like this. I'm hoping that she probably just mentioned that it'd be cool to go and my mom took that as she's upset and wants to go now. I gotta speak to my sister in person after reading some of your guys comments and get a straight response from the source", "I'd feel awful taking away something so important from my mom over my sister's actions since technically mom didn't do anything wrong but beg me to pay for my sister (which I've said no to both times). I would never forgive myself from taking an experience my mom could never have again from her over this", "I hope so. My mom of all people should understand not being able to afford things since she's worse off financially than even I am. I just wish I didn't feel so pressured", "That may be the only option. I first want to speak with my sister in person and get her exact words on if she does or does not want to go and what she expects. Once I have that then I can either postpone for my sister to save or go with mom this year and hopefully have my sister be okay with it in the end", "When I first brought it up to mom as a gift for her this year and that my sister couldn't come, she was of course bummed but also very excited and started planning with me. It wasn't until my sister (maybe) said something to her that she switched a bit. I am going to speak with my sister in person and see if she really wants to go or if mom is blowing it out of proportion. If my sister tells mom she will be okay if just me and her go then mom will get back to being excited and happy - I'm sure", "Totally not the point, I know, but I have to defend my mom because she works 40-50 hours at her job and petsits on the side and still struggles (tis the suffering of people nowadays). I do agree that my sister could have saved money she spend on tattoos or weed to pay for the trip, but then again, knowing her, she probably didn't think she wanted to go until mom and I started planning for it more thoroughly", "I haven't had a chance to speak with her about this yet because it has to be in person (she will ignore my texts if she gets upset). I might go to my mom's at some point next week and try to catch her after she comes home from work to talk. As of now, it's been her venting to my mom since they live together but mom rightfully thinks this is a once in a lifetime trip and that all of us should go. I don't think either are trying to be malicious, but it means a lot to my mom for both of us to join her if that makes sense.", "I'm not sure but can you link me to the post? I think it'd be hilarious if someone else is going through the same ordeal as me with my sister still living at home and wanting to treat my poor mom to an international trip lol", "Lots of entitled family members trying to get free vacations from their generous relatives lol. There was another one on here earlier.", "Omg I didn't even think about the fact that there's tons of walking involved with our trip that my sister would refuse to do. UGH. I hope she really doesn't want to go and that my mom just misunderstood a comment she said? I am going to speak with my sister in person next week.", "We're in the US and mom had been learning Italian the past year in prep and she's excited to see where her side of the family is from. I know I'd be happy with any international destination, but Italy is like her #1 dream thing (which I get) and she wants to take so many pictures in Sicily where her grandmother used to live.\n\nI definitely will be speaking with my sister in person about if she is going and lay out the finances (at least regarding Italy itself and not my personal stuff) so mom understands how expensive the plane and hotel are alone.", "She has been picking up more hours at work, but I think that's just to pay her basic bills and stuff. I have to speak to her in person about this Italy thing and if she's going to save for that. Judging by my mom though, she isn't planning on it. I also can't postpone the trip due to my own job and some things I need to get done (surgeries) Fall 2023/Spring 2024.", "I know my mom is just trying to give everyone what they want and have a nice family trip with just the three of us - which I also would like to have one day - but she doesn't truly realize the price of things since it's a gift for her and she thinks I have the funding (why? not entirely sure)", "I told her that we can go on a smaller trip all 3 of us at some point later on but that for something this big (to me at least) I can't budget for my sister. Also, just realized, she would also need to get a passport, which mom and I applied for last month and should come in around March. So that would postpone things even more", "I have a few savings accounts already lol but I don't want to cancel a trip my mom deserves over the possibility of my sister changing her mind, you know?", "I really thought I was avoiding issues by asking my sister if she wanted to come as soon as I thought of the idea for my mom's bday. I didn't think she would change her mind (if she did and mom isn't misunderstood). I will absolutely be speaking with my sister in person to see if she actually wants to go or not and go from there. I hope she will be okay with waiting and maybe we can do a trip of all 3 of us later down the road and still give mom a good birthday trip this year.", "Your sis is manipulating your mom.

You and mom can't afford it!", "[removed]", "You really shouldn't. She should just appreciate what you're doing for her.", "NTA.  Suggest changing the trip to the following year to give extra time to save.  See how she responds to the offer.", "You seem like a very sweet, generous woman. I can understand your mom wanting both of her daughters on this trip but your sister isn't a child and your mom needs to realize she should've made efforts to save if she really wanted to go. Is there any way your sister can take out a loan to pay her own way? Definitely don't put yourself in a financial bind to make this happen!", "Regardless of whether you can afford it or not, if someone gifts your a trip you do not turn around and say we\u2019ll person x wants to come so you should also pay for her. That\u2019s absurd", "Don't let her do that to you. You have a right to decide how to use your money. When you offer someone-anyone- a gift, the only appropriate responses are thank you  and no, but thank you. Asking for more is unacceptable. Asking twice is way beyond unacceptable.", "Try to explain that to your mother again. Let her know that you have really been saving for months and you can hardly afford it all.\nYour sister has not saved anything and now she is not offering anything, such as partly paying now and partly paying back later.\nThe trip is a gift for your mother, not your sister.\n\nNTA.", "It might be helpful if you talk to your mom a bit about your finances. Enough for her to get a truer picture. And maybe give her an idea of the cost of your sister's priorities (tattoos, weed). That's a lot of money she could have saved up! Sometimes you need to clean people's glasses for them so they can see what's in front of them.", "I have a feeling that your mom is going to complain the entire trip if your sister is not there. It is not your responsibility to pay for your sister to come. Your mom is really treating you badly though. Do not make excuses for this behavior.

Been there done that.", "Yeah I saw some other comments from you now and I think you can probably solve this by speaking to your sister! Wishing you the best!", "Is she willing to drop it?

I gave my mom an iPhone a few years back. My sister\u2019s phone screen broke about a week later (convenient IMO). She told our mom she needed a good working phone more than mom did, so mom just gave her the new iPhone I\u2019d gifted her. I was unbelievably hurt and angry, but there was nothing I could do. When you realize your sibling sucks, you just gotta change your own behavior to try and avoid their behaviors.", "Sorry but I get the feeling that this was probably your sister\u2019s plan all along. It was never a matter of not wanting to go so much as not wanting to pay to go.", "I think you need to talk in person - just in case it's actually your mom who is more upset here.

I don\u2019t even know you but I\u2019m excited af for y\u2019all lmao", "She gets cheques and most do go to bills and other goes to her hobbies that I outlined in a previous comment", "I am actually starting to believe my sister never said she wanted to go and my mom just misconstrued a comment from her on xmas. Based on texting my sister after posting this", "I\u2019m prepping until we leave exercising daily so i can just feast a plenty \ud83e\udd70Thanks for being excited for us! Tell me, is it easy to get around with basic Italian? My mom and I have been learning via duolingo for almost a year but i am not confident", "You should not have to explain to your mom why she can\u2019t spend your money.", "I kind of doubt it is unintentional since she has brought it up twice.", "It depends on where you go but I think you\u2019d be fine even if you didn\u2019t know any! In the big cities everyone spoke English, and in the smaller towns we were able to get by with a mixture of English and broken Spanish haha. They\u2019re used to tourists though, so it was really never a problem!", "Well it turns out, after a few texts back and forth with my sister after posting this, mom just misunderstood a comment my sister made and thought she wanted to go when she doesn\u2019t so no worries", "I actually finished my text convo with my sister and she said she never wanted to go she just made a comment about us going to mom and mom misunderstood thinking she wanted to go. All is well", "Fabulous! My mom is really proud of learning her Italian despite our obvious accents so hopefully no one judges when she tries speaking to them in their tongue lol\ud83d\ude02", ">... OCD I am about my savings/paymentss/budgets because I definitely keep strict to what I can and cannot afford haha\n\nYou don't have control of the exchange rate OR inflation. If you haven't booked anything for this trip yet, you don't actually know how much it is going to cost you.\n\nI have traveled extensively and do know how it works.", "I meant your MOTHER was guilting you by bringing it up twice.\n\n I hope your mom drops the subject now that she knows your sister doesn't want to go. Good luck.", "You act like I haven\u2019t traveled before lol I have made a budget which is a little more than I know we will need (in case of emergencies). I am completely fine financially when the two of us go.", "Has your mom always been this helpless?", "No I think u/Emotional-Coast5117 means uninvite **your mother** if she continues to try to emotionally blackmail you. \n\nI get that you love your mother, but she is being totally unreasonable. And I wouldn't bet that your sister is egging her on - she's just smart enough to know you are a soft touch with your mom. \n\nFYI, I don't think you need to share the intimate details of your finances either. That is none of her business and could come back to bite you.", "I would only share finances of the trip alone and my budget and where the money is going for Italy. Nothing personal ever", "So happy to see your second edit :)", "NTA ! Ur not responsible for anyone else\u2019s vacation you\u2019re being nice enough to help your mom out with this. Don\u2019t let your sister push her away into it and make your mother feel bad. Let your mom now you can\u2019t afford it and if she really wants to push it you can cancel the event or go on your own, but this event is for her only and you do not have the means or the funds to pay for your sister to", "NTA your sister would have had 11 months to save. If she put aside 50 a week for all weeks, or even almost all weeks (some weeks she might not be able to because low income) she would have had over $2000. She lives at home, so probably pays token rent, her expenses are low, there\u2019s no reason besides being bad with money that she couldn\u2019t plan ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s not a family trip, it\u2019s your bday gift for your mom.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t stop your mother from paying for your sister, but it is absolutely not your responsibility. If she can\u2019t afford it she can\u2019t go. You need to keep your money for you. It\u2019s not just flights and hotel either, who\u2019s going to feed her or pay for her to go places?\n\nI went to Italy with my best friend when we were in our early twenties. I\u2019d budgeted how much I could spend each day with a little left over for an emergency. My friend did not. She spent our whole time there buying anything she wanted, little trinkets, tickets for museums, drinks in clubs, fine right? On our last day my friend had no money left for food. So I could\u2019ve either paid for her food all day or watch her starve. I paid for her food, and while I didn\u2019t tell her, I was incredibly annoyed that she\u2019d put me in this position.\n\nStick to your guns OP, don\u2019t get guilted into paying if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA and get to booking now. My cousin and I just booked UK/Ireland and a lot of its getted sold out.", "So apparently it's mom getting something really wrong. Which makes the mom an asshole imo.", "nta", "I\u2019m so grateful dude I\u2019ve been stressing since last night over this \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc9c Thankfully no more worries!", "It turns out she didn\u2019t even want to go she just mentioned to my mom that its cool we\u2019re going and my mom, sweet soul, took it as \u201ci wish i could go too\u201d. So thankfully just a big misunderstanding \ud83d\ude02 If my sis wants to do a trip all 3, like we talked about today, I did mention saving a little bit per paycheque or at least giving a heads up if she comes up short", "I hope you see this but don't wait til March to get your tickets, if you have thr money, but them prices. Prices are crazy and are going to get worse. ( I'm a travel agent)", "Could you elaborate?", "There are vacation packages that are payment plans that don\u2019t have obnoxious fees for the convenience of paying monthly versus deposits and even the rest or all at once. My mom and her husband just went to Aruba and did a 8 month payment plan, it was pretty affordable, now they want to take the whole family lol", "Eh, sounds like OP\u2019s mom is pushing for her sister to come because *she* wants a family vacation, not because sis wants to go. Kinda shitty to financially strap OP like that", "Omg what??? Everyone said to wait up to 6 months to buy an international flight from US. Should I buy ASAP?", "Read OP's second edit. Apparently mom misinterpreted something and decided to push based on a misunderstanding, rather than discussing with sis first. Creating needless drama as a result.", "What website is this through? I mentioned trying to do Mexico with all 3 of us in 2024 (so I can save back up after Italy this year). So it may be worthwhile to see what\u2019s up with a package deal and if itd be worth it", "You\u2019re fine if you book ~6 months ahead of time. Even 4 months is plenty of time so don\u2019t worry.", "Thank god! Almost gave me a heart attack \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m waiting because both our passports should be in by March. I worry about booking beforehand as what if the passports are extremely late or denied for some reason? It\u2019s a risky biscuit lol", "NTA, you owe your sister nothing.", "Do not wait. Buy it now. ETA: I book flights overseas every day. I've seen how the prices are going up. Yes, you can wait, but if you want a better price, buy as soon as you are able to", "I\u2019m not sure. I think it\u2019s one that has travel agents but is completely digital.\n\nI know cruises offer this, and then offer huge discounts on future bookings", "NTA. My family and I all love to travel, and all my siblings have done individual trips with my parents. It always sucks not being able to go away somewhere cool like that, but your sister is only 23. She will have another opportunity to go in the future. But she can't afford it right now so she can stay home. That's really all there is to it.", "Of course she wants to go. You're going to Italy! But, she will have other opportunities in the future. Not being able to go now doesn't mean she'll never get out there. It's just the way things work", "Ironically she doesnt want to go lol I spoke with her and mom just misunderstood a comment she made at christmas saying \u201cit\u2019s cool you guys are going\u201d. My mom heard \u201cI wish I could go\u201d \ud83d\ude02"]}
