You are a VERY healthy weight. Second, even if you gained a few pounds that\u2019s OKAY too. She shouldn\u2019t be doing this.", "NTA, how can you be told by multiple medical professionals that your wrong and still not budge?", "NTA- share this with your mom\n\nI had a mom like this. Picking at everyone's size, pointing out all the flaws with everyone else's body. She also yoyo dieted my whole life, still does. I was always really tiny, I hit puberty late, so that was definitely part of it. I was under 100 pounds until senior year of high school. Anytime I ate what I wanted, or junk, or whatever my mom would comment on, \"you won't be this skinny forever l, you need to stop eating like this!\"\n\nWhen I started developing curves, and a NORMAL adult body in college I couldn't handle it. I was still barely 110 pounds but I developed an eating disorder. I literally turned it into a game to see how long I could go without eating. I was obsessed with not getting \"fat\" because of 18 years of dealing with a mom who was convinced I would get fat. That is NOT NORMAL. \n\nIt took me WAY to long to accept what a normal woman's body looks like (and that my pre-pubescent body isn't a normal adult woman's body) \n\nMy mom cause so much harm qith her comments. \n\nI've had 2 kids, and I'm currently over 160 pounds. I like it. I like my body, I like my boobs, I like my hips. I like having an hourglass figure. My mom would start commenting on my body as soon as I delivered my kids. Talking about gym memberships, watching what I ate better (I was breastfeeding and needed to eat more.) She would have everyone over for dinner, and purposely give dessert to everyone but me.\n\nGuess what? I've gone NC with my mom. I hope when you move out someday, it doesn't take you until you're 35 to cut your mom out.", "\"A significant portion of teens in the US have self-image and weight issues!

She obviously has her own body image issues, but they're her issues, not yours. If every doctor says you're healthy, then you have absolutely nothing to be worried about, and your mum needs to learn to shut her damn mouth. Maybe the money she spends sending you to doctors should be used to get herself some therapy.", "Oh dear. Please speak to other adults/teachers/counselors about this if you can. I am especially concerned that your mother makes you skip meals during your growing years. \n\nObvious NTA, but I doubt you can get your mother to stop. Stay strong, and I am sending you all my love.", "NTA \nMom is. Being constantly reminded of your weight isn't nice", "NTA. It sounds like your mom had an eating disorder that she's trying to pass on to you.", "NTA. Keep telling her to shut up. She\u2019s obsessed and the constant badgering can have long term emotionally damaging consequences.\n\nShe should shut up for your own good. She is being abusive and a bad mom.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems like your mother desperately wants you to have issues with your weight and self-esteem. That\u2018s a huge AH attitude. She should be happy and relieved that you aren\u2019t obsessed with weight loss and beauty standards.", "You are 100% NTA. But is there someone you can find to support you in this? Is your dad or a grandparent around? How old are you?", "NTA, not even close. \n\nOP, if you have another trusted adult in your life who can help advocate for you (parent, grandparent, teacher, etc) let them know what is going on and ask them for help in facilitating a conversation. Because what your mom is doing is manipulative and can be psychologically damaging. \n\nAs someone who was just a curvier teen with the cruelty of mid 2000s fashion, I have been exactly where you are. Please remember that being strong, healthy and comfortable in your body is more important than a number on a scale or the tag in your clothes.", "NTA.  If your doctor says you're the perfect weight then that's all you need to know.  The amount of body fat displayed by most models today is below what is ideally healthy, anyway.  (Because if they were to get really sick, their bodies couldn't sustain them through it.)\n\nConcentrate on being healthy and strong and your body will do great.\n\nEdit: Your mom doesn't want what's best for you.  She wants what's best for *her*.  She wants a teen idol or for you to attract boys that want teen idols.", "NTA. Try showing her these comments, they might shake some sense into her because what she's doing is emotionally abusive and one of the many reasons lots of young girls develop eating disorders.\n\nIf she's reading this, mam, you need intensive therapy. You are ignoring professional orders because you think you know better, I can promise you that you don't. That \"opinion' in itself is a sign of either mental illness or a low IQ, I'm hoping it's the first one as at least that's easier to fix then stupidity. You do not know better then someone with a degree in all this. This is all just a reflection of how you view yourself pressed onto your child. I know you think it's normal, but you've got to stop or else you will lose your child. Either from cutting you off, or something else. If she is healthy telling her to lose weight will damage her health. So stop.", "NTA, there\u2019s a difference between constructive/concerned conversation and bullying and it sounds like your mum is the latter. That sort of behaviour can be so harmful!", "Oh God, the well meaning family member/ friend who will not stop because \"they only care about your health\" so how can that be bad? NTA. The fact that she would be happier if you developed an eating disorder should tell you something. Guard yourself. You are fine. There is a fun podcast, Maintenance Phase, that both of you would benefit from bit it is likely you may be the only one who would listen. It might give you amo and a language to deal with this. NTA.", "NTA hands down. My mom did this to me my entire life. I was underweight most of my childhood. As a sophomore in highschool, I finally hit 100 lbs  and I was excited. My  mom told me she didn't weigh that until she was 9 months pregnant with my older brother. It took me 15 years, an eating disorder, and an offhand comment to my daughter before I snapped and told her to stop talking to us about our weight, eating habit, etc. Kudos to you for your confidence and courage to stand up for yourself.", "Oh yikes. This might take a lot of therapy to undo. Nta at all and often people forced into dieting young get a messed up relationship with food that can lead to unhealthy weights on both ends. My parents had me diet young and it messed up my metabolism.", "NTA. You have not gone far enough to prevent this. I would imagine this behaviour could cause huge self image and confidence problems. I would write down how this behaviour makes you feel, present it to her and if she refuses to stop, refuse to engage with her. I know thats harder in your teens but this is basically bullying.", "NTA", "NTA. Your mother is shaming you into an eating disorder and it's great that you set boundaries (or at least that you try)", "OP, I am so sorry to read what you are going through and it is so exhausting on your part dealing with her. You did nothing wrong telling her to stop going on and on about your weight so NTA.\n\nI am glad that you have medical professionals standing by you on this. If I am one of them, I would gladly give your mum a serious word and tell her what she is doing to you is harmful and unacceptable. It is not okay on her part\n\nDo you have any trusted adult you can turn to like a teacher, a relative, friend's parent or school counsellor? Do not suffer in silence and confide in any of those trusted people. Do talk to your doctor too. I believe your mother needs a parenting course on how her obsession with your weight is driving a wedge between you both \n\nIf she keeps at it, I suggest you should temporarily move out and crash with friends or relatives for a few weeks to put space between you both and make it clear to her that you won't put up with her behaviour anymore", "NTA\n\nI feel I could have written this when I was about your age, except I never confronted my mother.\n\nI ended up developing a horrible relationship with food and of course an eating disorder. At one point I was barely eating and it almost killed me. I am lucky to be healthy now and I feel good about my size even though sometimes she still comes up with comments like that. I just don\u2018t listen anymore.\n\nSo yeah, keep telling her to shut up! And maybe get some other family member to support you. But please please please don\u2018t believe anything she\u2018s saying. She\u2018s crazy.", "NTA, and good luck", "NTA. Sounds like you should have told to STFU years ago. You should keep telling her that and if she doesn\u2019t stop making hurtful derogatory comments then you should go NC.

Your doctor already said you are healthy and don't need to lose weight.  I have a child that still has issues and worries about gaining weight.   Just before they had a huge growth spurt they gained a bit of weight.  They weren't fat, but a bit chunky and I knew a spurt was coming.  Their father (we are not married anymore) made a bunch of fat comments to him and despite it being over 10 years those really stuck.

I sadly know a woman who is literally morbidly obese and shopped around until she found a doctor that wouldn't call her out. She also left bad reviews on the doctors who did, without explicitly saying weight was the issue they disagreed on. She's otherwise an extremely nice and pleasant person, but this issue brings out the worst in her.\n\nIt is still not mom's place to comment once OP tells her to stop, and controlling food is awful.
