Many of our family members and friends are meat-eaters and enjoy having a drink or two, and they feel uncomfortable and unaccustomed to the restrictions being imposed on them. They feel like they won't be able to fully enjoy the wedding and that it is not a true representation of who they are.\n\nI understand my daughter's choices and respect them, but I also want to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and happy. After much discussion with my family and friends, I decided to host an alternative reception at my home, where meat and alcohol are going to be served, for those who are unhappy with my daughter's reception. I made it clear that this is an optional event and that everyone was welcome to attend or not.\n\nMany guests are choosing to attend the alternative reception instead of my daughter's reception, which is making her feel completely distraught and angry. She thinks that I have disrespected her and her partner's choices, and is accusing me of trying to sabotage her wedding. I told her that this is not the case, and that I am simply trying to provide the wedding guests with more options. She insists that I should have supported her decision and made sure that everyone was comfortable with it.\n\nMy daughter is threatening to disinvite me and my husband from the wedding if I do not cancel this alternative reception, and I am now unsure if I am doing the right thing. I want to make sure that everyone is happy, but I also don't want to create an unnecessary rift with my daughter.

You seem to be a bit mixed up on that point.  Surely, the guests can manage a few hours without alcohol and eat the food.  If the guests believe that they won't be able to eat ANYTHING at the reception, then maybe they should eat before the event and drive through McDonald's on the way home.  I'm not a vegan but not all vegan food is weird (e.g., salad).\n\nAnd to host an \"alternate reception\" and thereby, not be attending your own daughter's reception is just downright RUDE.
