While the laws may vary between where we live, generally speaking, there are very few cases where someone who owned real property (a house, in this case) does not have to go through probate. To sell the house at all without going through a title company would require an executor/administrator to be appointed by the court and then it would be another whole process to determine heirship, after which letters of administration will be appointed to the appointed administrator. These letters will allow said administrator to close bank accounts, sell the house, and parcel out the estate as decreed by the court. \n\nYour first step is to find an attorney in your state who does probates without a will. They won\u2019t be able to start anything until you have a death certificate, so make sure you have the death certificate by the time of your appointment. They will likely tell you that any community property will go to your step mother, but assets he entered the marriage with might go to you and your siblings, OP. Without knowing where you live, I can\u2019t give you any more information about what this process is going to look for you. \n\nIf you have the Next Door app, ask for attorney recommendations on there. The firm I work for gets a ton of people coming off Next Door. And most firms keep a referral list, so if the first place you call can\u2019t help you, ask for a referral. Best of luck, and I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\n(DM me if you live in Texas and I can get you a referral)", "If there is no will the estate will be administered. It is only probated if there is a will.  There is usually a table of heirs and the spouse gets dower or courtesy in the estate plus usually a living allowance. The children only don't get a share where they are specifically disinherited in a will. Anything jointly held by the husband and wife are not part of the estate and goes to the surviving spouse. Same for life insurance it goes directly to the beneficiary. The same hold true for IRA's and other retirement accounts. There may be actually very little or nothing to be administered in the father's estate depending on what type of property he owned and how it was titled. Inheritance laws are very state dependent,so OP should definitely contact an attorney in the state where his father lived.", "Whether probate is require depends on the law where the deceased is located, locally, etc.  Not everywhere has the spouse inheriting everything in the absence of a will, so probate is the better choice to make sure the law is followed where parties do not agree on what happens to the assets.", "NTA.

It's not even a conflict, it's a situation where if dad wanted 100% assets to go to step mom and step kids he should have had a will. Probate IS the law.", "Not true.

It also notifies them that the executor has filed the petition, which is a formal request made by the executor to administer the estate. The presiding judge reviews the petition.", "Yes. I absolutely will not ask for anything if my dad dies before my stepmom because why should she have to sell HER house or give me any of THEIR money. I guess I just don\u2019t think adult children are entitled to anything over living spouses. If my dad wants me to have something he can put it in a will or designate me as beneficiary to a life insurance policy. In my state I wouldn\u2019t be entitled to anything  anyway since they\u2019re married.", "In many cases the children are entitled to a portion of the estate if there is no will.  However it depends heavily on the state, and there are ways a married couple can keep many assets out of the estate, like having joint ownership of the property so it automatically passes to the spouse, having joint ownership of bank accounts and having the spouse being the named beneficiary of any insurance policies.", "Because your kids will get the stuff when you die but step mom might now give anything to former step kids when she dies, especially if she was only around for a few years with the kids and then went on to marry someone else. Not saying thats the case in this family, just saying why step parents inheritance is different then when the bioparents stay married", "But what if they own the home together? That would still be her house, correct?", "Maybe the law says she gets it anyway. He needs a lawyer not Reddit.", "Intestate law isn\u2019t something you can opt into or choose.  Just because your experience of not going through the legal proceeds worked out doesn\u2019t mean that it was done correctly. No idea where you live, but every state has some kind of version of it.  \n\n\nJust look up \u201cintestate succession [your state]\u201d\n\n\ntl; dr - just because you choose not to follow the law doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t any laws that apply.", "That depends on whether things were owned jointly. If her name isn't on certain accounts or on the deed to the home that it goes to probate. As the children of the gentleman who died they can contest that in court if they choose to.", "Well fair and appropriate in a legal sense not a moral one.", ">\tIt\u2019s automatically assumed that it\u2019s going to the spouse if there\u2019s no will.\n\n\nIn many cases, it\u2019s also the law, and the will serves to allocate assets to individuals and entities besides the spouse.", "In Ohio the estate goes to the surviving spouse UNLESS there are children who are not related (aka natural children) to the surviving spouse. \n\nSuch as in this exact case.", "In Michigan the first $250,000 goes to the spouse.  I never got farther than that. (Late husband\u2019s estate wasn\u2019t large) so im not sure where the rest would go if it\u2019s more than $250k.", "It depends I know a lot of time things like houses are in both names and go to the survivor. Then there is usually a thing where if the estate is worth less then x amount the wife gets it all.", "Where are you? I\u2019m not aware of any US state where that would be the case.\n\nEdit: looks like you\u2019re in Ohio. [I think you\u2019re a little confused about how probate and intestate succession work there.](https://www.bakerfirm.com/which-assets-are-immune-to-ohio-intestate-succession/)\n\nMostly of the stuff that would pass outside of probate are things where he gets to designate beneficiaries. Everything else would go through probate, where the current wife would get the first $20k off the top and 1/3 of the remainder. You and any siblings she wasn\u2019t the mother of would split the remaining 2/3.", "Maybe in your state, but still NTA for OP to file for probate", "Sounds weird.", "people rarely know when they\u2019re going to die. death doesn\u2019t discriminate. his dad should\u2019ve made a will to prevent this - it was poor judgement on the dads part to not make a will despite having adult children.", "It is. It really depends on the area, but sometimes it may go straight to the children, sometimes it\u2019s split. There is no general rule.", "You know better than me. I thought it was a matter of court procedures. So if no one does anything it all just is there for whoever wants it?", "Because in some cases if everything passed to the wife and it was stuff from the dad's family his children could lose it all. A good mother is less likely (not entirely just less) to rip off her children. Unfortunately, I have seen this happen too many times. It's why I have a will and why even if we separate and I get married to someone else my current partner will remain the beneficiary on my will.", "Intestacy statutes are written in a way that assumes the deceased loves their family equally. They love both their kids and their wife and they would want them both to be given something and cared for when they pass. That\u2019s the best the governments can do. If that is not how a person feels, then they need to hire an estate planning attorney to get their specific desires down in writing.\n\nEdit: and they are long statutes. Usually if the kids are shared with the spouse the spouse gets everything because the thought is that spouse will eventually leave the kids everything they have. If there are minor kids, the state does not want to pay for them so the estate must cover them if there is anything in it. There\u2019s always some sort of logic behind the way it is written", "It doesn\u2019t really matter if she doesn\u2019t have a legal right to OP\u2019s dad\u2019s property. \n\nSelling everything before it goes to probate when there was no will or clear law giving her possession of all this things is an AH move.", "I'd say that their relationship isn't the relevant one. The relationship between OP, OP's siblings and their dad is the relevant one and it doesn't seem like they'd been estranged.", "Unfortunately my mom died suddenly without a will but it taught us to make sure we have a will/trust set up. There was no fighting after my mom died because we knew she would want everything split evenly and we respected her wishes. \n\nSomething about death and money makes people start salivating at the mouth and become greedy monsters. It breaks my heart. There seems to be no real grief happening over the fact OP just lost his father. OP seems more concerned about losing money.", "I think \"Advance Directive\" may be what you're talking about?", "That depends on a few things. If dad owned the house just in his name, it goes to the estate for probate- the will or local law controls for that. \n\nIf it was in both names, it depends on how the deed describes the arrangement. Each could own half, or they could share it equally and, once one owner died, the other owner automatically owns the whole thing. \n\nIf each owned their own half, the father\u2019s half goes to the estate", "Well, we did visit with an estate lawyer and were told it didn\u2019t need to go through probate so I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I do believe it was fortunate for us that his children were either co owners on bank accounts, beneficiaries on 401k/insurance and listed on property titles.", "Lots of maybes or could bes to be calling my response bullshit.", "Stuff just gets messed up. Taxes accrue. Insurance doesn\u2019t get switched over. It becomes a big mess. Many times real property passes outside of probate based on how it is titled so when one spouse dies it automatically passes to the other spouse. Many tax collectors just need a copy of the death certificate in such an instance. OP might have a hard pill to swallow if they discover all of the assets were titled in a way that made them pass outside of probate. This is why having an estate plan (will and/or combination of trust documents and properly titled assets) is so important to make sure you leave your assets they way you want to the people you love.", "But why are adult children entitled to something over a current spouse? I don\u2019t feel my dad or step mom owes me anything. Just like I wouldn\u2019t expect anything from my mother.", "I answered about being an asshole which is not regulated by law lol. I definitely understand that the law stipulates all of this. And also 100% agree that dad should have figured this out in advance. For all we know he did, and step mom is listed on the property and is the beneficiaries on all accounts. You don\u2019t necessarily need a will if that\u2019s the case.", "But the point is she probably does\u2026we don\u2019t know.  No will, no probate.", "It seems that way, but no will makes me wonder why dad wouldn\u2019t have made sure his kids got a fair share.  That makes me wonder about dad, stepmom and kids.  Interesting stuff here.", "I'm hoping my family will be fine. My mum had 4 kids but only 3 of us are alive today. My stepdad is amazing too so fingers crossed when mum passes all we have to deal with is the grief. I really couldn't handle people trying to fight me while I bury my mother.\n\nMy grandmother (my mums mum) is nearly 80 and has dementia. Chances are she will pass soon. My family are already fucking fighting about it. I was born on my nan's birthday so she named me, raised me and taught me a lot. 90% of the time she doesn't even know who I am. All my family are concerned about is what's going to happen to all the land she owns. It's disgusting. Makes me want to burn the shit to the ground.", "Haha thanks. It's been awhile since I looked at the paper work so I forget what they all are.", "The part where they were co owners on everything is how they were able to bypass probate, not because they all agreed on where the assets should go.", "I'm just saying it's bullshit to tell them to just forget about it and move on. They have the right to find out if they're entitled to anything and I think it would be a pretty shitty deal of the stepmom to screw his kids out of anything that belonged to their father.", "It\u2019s why I have one. Trusts are your friend!", "I think adult children are entitled to family heirlooms. I don't care about other shit. \n\nFor instance my grandfather fought in WW2 he survived and was awarded with a few medals that my dad currently has. His fiancee and him have been together for 13 or 14 years. She and her children have no right to keep my grandfathers medals. They did not know him. They have no connection to him. She is not entitled to them just because of a piece of paper. She doesn't owe us anything but she does owe my father the respect in honouring his wishes and passing them to our younger sister when he passes.", "You know, if I had a buck for every time I heard a story about people not leaving any will or handling their affairs before their death because they, thought their loved ones would handle things maturely, and then the heirs fighting tooth and nail, I would order take out tomorrow.", "So it is in fact correct that not everything needs to go through probate? The stepmom may very well be on all the accounts.", "That is true but also shitty of dad to not have a will.", "100% agree regarding heirlooms!", "True dat.", "Outside of that I think the children should stay out of it. I get some parents are loaded but in many cases they worked really bloody hard for their money. They should do what they like. \n\nI knew a lady who found out her DIL wanted to demolish the house her husband had built for her when they first got married. So she gifted the house to used as a treatment centre for teenage addicts. I would've loved to have seen her DILs face when she found out they weren't getting the house."]}
