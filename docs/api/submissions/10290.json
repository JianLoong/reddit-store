Your mother, tho...", "NTA I went through this with my family too. China cabinet with china sets, the whole thing. I just said I didn\u2019t want it from the beginning because we have no space for it in our apartment. My Mom and aunt recently moved my grandma to assisted living and I only accepted the Waterford champagne glasses, which now sit in their box on top of another box I have no place for on a table in the office/guest room of our two bedroom apartment. I don\u2019t even use our riedel wine glasses because I swear if I even look at them wrong they shatter.  So the Waterford glasses will remain in a their box until we all die and I make them my little brother\u2019s children\u2019s problem s/.", "NTA, sounds like she does not want it either.", "NTA. Your Mother got herself into this situation. It should be easy to say 'no, thank you'.", "NTA perfectly reasonable to decline a gift if you have a reason which you do your mother also didn\u2019t have to accept it either", "NTA and that was a clever and diplomatic action on your part.  Methinks  your mom is mad because you cleverly and sweetly out maneuvered her.  \n\n\nEDIT: Just by the way, has your mom seen your apartment?  Maybe it's time to invite your mom over and ask her exactly where she thinks you should put it?", "You're NTA. Too bad your mom didn't like it when the tables were turned on her.", "NTA. You should probably wait a while before asking your mom for some of the china.  I woke my dog up when I laughed at that line.", "NTA\n\nYou're free to decide on the interior of your house. It is fun to be able to integrate old family furniture into your interior, but if it doesn't combine well with your other furniture or if you don't have the space, it's just plain normal that you don't accept the family furniture. Same for your mother, she should be able to sell it or give it to someone else if she doesn't like it.", "NTA My mom used to always try to give me family heirlooms when I was building my career so I was usually moving somewhere for work, half the time I had a storage unit because I was in a studio apartment or something, and I would get mad because I don\u2019t even have room for my own stuff. \n\nGive it some time then ask your mom for some tea set stuff. You\u2019ll end up with it when your mom dies anyway.", "Nta, there\u2019s a reason china cabinets aren\u2019t popular anymore.

Giving her clutter to your mom since SHE deems it much more important than you do was the reasonable choice.", "Yeah. She needs some time.  LoL.", "I literally laughed out loud.", "Bless her heart", "She is just old fashioned.", "You may eventually use them I had a china tea set my grandma gave me that she got during WWII by trading cigarettes she didn\u2019t smoke that the military provided to her. \n\nIt sat packed in a box in various different storages in six different states in this country for probably 20 years. Now that I\u2019m in my 40s I\u2019ve decided to use it now, partly because I chose not to have children so there\u2019s no one for me to pass it to, but also because my mom recently died with a whole bunch of tea pots on top of the refrigerator that she never used, that I didn\u2019t have a place for her so I\u2019m hoping her neighbors took them. So I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going to use this china tea said and if it breaks it breaks it\u2019s better than me storing it in a box until I die to have an end up in a dumpster because nobody wanted it.", "Yeah. But now she is stuck with them.  She accepted. If I'm ever able to afford a space with ba proper dining room I may ask for the fancy stuff.", "Old fashioned people have better manners than to complain about inheriting their mothers fine China until their child is in a place to inherit them.", "That\u2019s a nice way to say abusive", "Very true! I\u2019m 34, but we live in an apartment and don\u2019t even have a dining room table. We eat at the coffee table haha. So maybe once we move out of this high cost of living city and have a proper dinging table, that basset hound tails can\u2019t whip glasses off of, we will bust those glasses out. And we will toast to you. :)", "I think in the next few years the bottom is going to completely drop out of the china market. If it hasn't already.  My wife and I have some.  But it gets used twice a year.  Easter and Christmas.", "Oh, that ship sailed long ago.\n\nI use my wedding set on odd occasions when I'm feeling like it, but it needs to be hand washed...so...\n\nI think the current thing is to use multiple sets for a cute tea party catering business. It's a nice semi-retirement gig.", "There have been several articles in the last 5 years about younger generations not wanting their family heirlooms.", "I use mine as my everyday wear now.  It doesn\u2019t have any metallic trim so I can put it in the dishwasher and microwave.  I live in dread of when my mother passes.  She has 3 sets of china (why Mom?) and gorgeous crystal.  At that point I\u2019ll try to distribute most of it to family.  One of my cousins has always been lovely to her.  I\u2019m hoping she would enjoy it.", "They may regret that when they get older, they may not. I\u2019m Gen X and my mom used to always try to show me the cool family heirlooms that she had when I would go visit her and I literally could not care less, but then she died and I didn\u2019t go get them because I had nowhere to put them and I will randomly feel really bad about that sometimes.\n\nBut yeah I don\u2019t think the older folks understand, they could buy a house for $30,000, we can\u2019t even rent an apartment for less than $20,000 a year nobody\u2019s getting a big enough place to store all that stuff these days. And young people have no use for fine China.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you\u2019ll eventually have more space, and everyone should eat off the good china at least sometimes. But now is not that time for you.\n\nA tale of how our families\u2019 old things came to fit in our home:\n\nMy spouse and I both had long experience of housing instability and small or ad-hoc spaces. We each went years without entirely unpacking.\n\nMy spouse rescued a bunch of family silver from a big fast downsize when their mom\u2019s health took a turn. It was in boxes in a corner when I met them. And I had inherited four settings of my great-grandmother\u2019s wedding china, and some other family things that remind me of my childhood and my beloved dead. They were packed and taking up space without doing us any good.\n\nShortly before the pandemonium, my MIL died and left us a little money. Not retirement money, but a down payment on a 3-bed townhouse. We would rather not have lost her so early, but we feel lucky that we have a secure home at last.\n\nSo for last Yule I asked for a free china cabinet off Craigslist\u2014they\u2019re big and people give them away if you\u2019ll just take them. My present was the cost of the UHaul, and help loading/unloading. We did have a spot for it, and emptying the boxes of fragiles and packing material has decluttered some space. We spent three evenings polishing silver and hand washing crystal. It all looks beautiful in its new home.\n\nWe\u2019ve since had two lovely family dinners with these nice things from both our families. My young adult kids are delighted, because they enjoy history and antiques. Highlight: for Imbolc we made butter and served it in this amazingly fancy 1890s rolltop butter dome. I had never seen one before polishing my late MIL\u2019s. So over-the-top and fun and pretty!\n\nSo it can be possible to use and enjoy old beauties, if you like them. But a little apartment doesn\u2019t really give scope for such things, and you were right to gently show your grandmother the challenges you face as a young person in a modest home.", "I think you handled this quite well... and craftily :-)\n\nYour mother is just mad because she didn't want the china cabinet either, and now her little plan has been foiled.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. One of the problems with fancy china is that virtually no one uses it now. Yes it\u2019s beautiful and nice, but it is a relic of the past. You were not rude or disrespectful of your grandmother. Your mom doesn\u2019t want the stuff any more than you do, but was happy for you to be stuck with it.", "NTA - your Mom is.", "What does being old fashioned have to do with her assuming you told your grandmother to give her those things, and thinking you\u2019re TA? That\u2019s not okay! Sorry she\u2019s being this way. :(", "Came here to say the same. The Boomers wanted *things*, but the following generations want *experiences*. It's really an interesting fundamental shift in lifestyles and values.", "Nobody can afford things or the space for them either!"]}
