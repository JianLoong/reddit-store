I married my husband not knowing he had a son. I only found out about it AFTER my daughter turned 2. We've dated for 3 years, but not once did he mention his son. I never met his son before that. Even after our wedding and during my pregnancy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was the ex-girlfriend who came over to our house with Josh (he was 5 back then).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, after A LOT of counseling, talks, me going through and asking every single question there is--even the absurd ones--we figured it out. I went from livid about his omission, to just annoyed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJosh occasionally stays over throughout the 11 years since I was made aware of him, and throughout those times, he sleeps on our pullout couch. We lived in a two-bedroom apartment and had another girl. So my daughters--Anna 13 and Jane 10--shared a bedroom. I tried my best when it came to Josh, but he said he never saw me as his mom, which was fair to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJosh turned 16, and stuff went down with the court. I don't know the full details. All I know is that Josh's mom was deemed unfit. My husband said Josh had nowhere to go and can't stay at his aunt's forever. We're not rich, but we needed to make a plan. We moved into a two-bedroom house BUT with a furnished basement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we told the kids, my husband and I talked. I said that we should give the basement to the two girls since it's a bigger space to share. They will hit their teens, and I don't want them to feel cramped and seem like they don't have privacy from each other when they need it. Josh would be taking the bedroom upstairs. My husband agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day we move, he flipped it. He told Josh that he was getting the basement and that it would be all his, it was like a mini-living room, etc. I was livid and pulled my husband aside. He told me Josh was planning to stay here while he goes to college in the future, and it should be fair for him to get a bigger space. I said it's fine if he wants to stay, I'll give him that choice. But the girls are going to turn into teens. It's not fair for them to be cramped in a one bedroom and lack privacy from each other. He told me to tell Josh myself then. I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat down with Josh, I told him that the initial agreement was he can get the upstairs for as long as he needs. And that it has walk in closet and we can even install a TV for him--his gaming set up also fits with still a lot of room to play VR. Josh blew up on me. He called me asshole and said just because I wasn't his son, I shouldn't be taking his room away. He told me he was sick and tired of me always favoring the girls. Which in my opinion, I tried try best. I brought him with us on trips--the girls enjoy his company and look up to him--I paid for his school trips, I sat with him during A LOT of parent teacher conference. I called out from work when he was sick to take care of him. I tried my best.

This is exactly what he did when he dated you, got engaged, and allowed you to make this serious investment into marrying him! His behavior has not changed. \n\nAnd then instead of accepting the responsibility of telling his son, he left it on you to do. Of course this would damage your relationship with the son! The 16-year-old had a messed up life with his entire family, and his deadbeat father promised him an apartment. Now his \"evil stepmother\" is telling him he has to give that up so HER daughters can have it. Of course he's not going to like you and we'll see you as favoring your daughters!  Your husband never should have put you in that position! She made you choose between following the agreement or looking like an ass to your stepson. What a terrible thing for a husband to do.\n\n*Just to clarify too, I don't think you're evil LOL.

That level of deception should be illegal. He went back on your agreement, gave his son the good news, then left it to you to give the bad news?

No. But at the end of the day, I think your husband set him up for failure by giving him expectations of the basement to himself. He's to blame.", "NTA You're not the AH and neither is Josh, your jerk of a husband did this and honestly, I wonder if he didn't do it on purpose - he sounds pretty crappy. He hid his child, he's a stay at home parent for kids that are not home all day and you have to call in sick if one of the kids is sick?

You deserve better.", "Let him take his mental health break at the homeless shelter or get a job.", "Oh, it's actually worse than I thought. He is not even a SAHP, just a moocher. OP, you might benefit of speaking with some professionals - a therapist and a divorce lawyer comes to mind. Then you would have a better understanding what your best course of action might be - for you and for your girls.", "No No and a big fat No.  By allowing this you are setting your girls and Josh up for failure. Your girls are going to think it's their responsibility to take care of any man in their life while the man is a lazy you know what.  Josh is learning that he can be lazy and not be held responsible for anything.", "Stop rolling over and lay down the facts - he\u2019s a deadbeat and a freeloader and he\u2019s clearly been manipulating you for years. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say divorce, but if this doesn\u2019t SERIOUSLY change you need to for your girls if nothing else. \n\nThe standard of treatment you accept from this man will be the standard they accept from their future partners.", "Your husband is taking advantage of your ASD.", "Stepson isn't the problem here.\n\nYour husband is.\n\nNever told you he had a son? Refusing to work because he just feels like a break? Went back on your agreement about who gets what space, without discussing it?\n\nHusband needs to go. None of this is acceptable.\n\nETA: Would I be correct in thinking there's a big age gap in your relationship?", "Oof. Girl. Have some self respect :( your girls are watching you let this man walk all over you and they\u2019re gonna start doing the same thinking it\u2019s normal. You\u2019ve gotta set some real boundaries and get some results or you need to get out of there.", "OP, if he has mental health issues, treatment and returning to normal function is far better than opting out", "Wow, if you really think he\u2019d deflect on everything in a group conversation, he doesn\u2019t have your back in this at all. How does he expect you to help raise a child that he kept hidden from you, and now he\u2019s doing everything in his power to make Josh hate you? This is 1000% his business. It\u2019s his bio kid. And, he\u2019s putting his daughters on the back burner and ignoring their needs in order to be a hero to Josh. I get that Josh didn\u2019t have the best childhood with his mom, but that doesn\u2019t mean your husband gets to play favorites here.\n\nBottom line is that your husband isn\u2019t giving you the support you need in a situation you\u2019re going above and beyond in. For him to say it\u2019s none of his business is ridiculous. If he\u2019s going to continue to not support you and not understand that he needs to stop being more than the \u201cfun dad\u201d to Josh, you may need to rethink your options.", "Your husband needs to do that or you need to leave him. It\u2019s not fair the games he\u2019s playing with you. You don\u2019t have a stepson problem you have a MAJOR husband problem. Your husband is a coward", "You need to grow a spine.  This guy is taking full advantage of you and you are being a doormat.  He looks great to the outside but he\u2019s a manipulative jackass.   Have a family meeting.  Be clear that this was originally a joint decision that he backed out of and you are not supporting the change.  And divorce his ass!!   Like seriously have some respect for yourself and your daughters.   What you are teaching them about healthy relationships?  Because this sure isn\u2019t one.   Keeping the fact that he had a child from you for years should have been the nail in the coffin.   How can you trust this person ever?   What are you teaching your daughters???   NTA but you would be if you don\u2019t act on all the advise you are getting here !!", "you're a Saint mate, if it was me I'd kick them both out, I'd have no patience for their bs", "It's not fair to blame Josh for having to stay with his dad and OP. It is, however, fair to blame Josh for being entitled and ungrateful. OP wasn't throwing him out, just giving him a different apparently perfectly adequate room and he threw a fit about it. Even if he was OP's own son, it would be reasonable to give the bigger space to two persons and the smaller to one instead of the other way round and there would be no grounds for complaining.", "His SAHD who didn't get the memo about staying home.", "Then this is a husband problem solely.   What is he telling his son behind your back?", "Still, he obviously is acting like an asshole in this particular instance and if it's not like him to act that way, maybe there's something else going on that's affecting him?", "I agree.  Im a SAHM who occasionally gets together with friends during the week.  My kids and running the household always come first though.", "I didn't think about that part. I just kinda got used to this lifestyle. But you're right, I need to change something so the kids don't normalize this.", "I decided to give Josh the upstairs room because he was talking about the walk-in closet being turned into a streaming/recording room. We even got soundproofing panels. We're also planning to split the basement into two rooms and a common area in the near future.\n\nI'll try talking to him about it with my husband.", "I dont really understand to be honest. I just want everyone happy. Josh became like family, I feel like he's a little brother more than a step-son. I guess I married too early.", "A child who was just removed from their mothers home by authorities and who had little to no contact with his dad until he was 5 and very definitively felt the anger OP has towards her husband about keeping him a secret is not TA for blowing up at yet another thing being taken away from him after it was promised to him. Yes, he didn\u2019t focus his anger in the right direction, but he\u2019s not TA for being angry and treating him like an adult who should be able to see reason in this scenario rather than a child who has been repeatedly abandoned by the adults in his life or been promised things that fell through isn\u2019t fair.", "And? Op isn\u2019t throwing the daughters out just giving him a different room and ops throwing a fit about it", "He\u2019s not entitled and ungrateful, he\u2019s disappointed and he\u2019s a kid! He\u2019s allowed!", "I don't know to be honest. I'm not good with trying to relate to people (I have ASD, and I just don't understand how to relate or form connection). All I know is what to do to possibly make them happy. I spent time with Josh, but I find it difficult to ask him questions about his personal life. My daughters just kinda dump their emotions and tells me everything, it's not an issue with them. But I lack a connection with Josh so I don't really know what Josh has been told by my husband.", "A part of me is thinking that my husband may have said more while I wasn't around. But I don't know how approach Josh without it sounding like I'm accusing his Dad of lying.", "Josh already thinks you're not doing enough for him, and his father isn't correcting him. Make your husband get a job with the goal of buying a house that doesn't have these issues, then file for divorce. You need him to have some income so he doesn't demand alimony.", "Yes, but you have actual children that are dependent on you. Josh and his father are using you, and undermining you and disrespecting you. Why would you want your daughters to grow up in a home like that?", "Josh is not **the** asshole here, just **an** asshole in this situation. The badge of the main asshole of the story indeed belongs to his dad.", "He may well be excused for acting entitled and ungrateful but that's still what he was doing in this situation.", "I pray you are reading all these compliments and letting them digest.  He hasn't been GOOD to you for a long time. This isn't normal.", "Ma\u2019am, as someone who also has ASD, I feel the need to tell you that you don\u2019t have a stepson problem, you have a your husband is using and manipulating you problem. \n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, and every other ASD woman I\u2019ve ever met - we\u2019re people pleasers, often to a fault. We struggle to always catch people\u2019s meaning, or pick up on \u2018vibes\u2019. We want those we care about to be honest and up front with us, because we are with them. A tendency to express affection and love through acts of service or taking on responsibility for them, because we often feel like we are not good at giving emotional support and forging connections through relating to people emotionally when they are struggling, but we try all that we can because we don\u2019t like feeling so cold and impotent. If someone is upset with us, we feel like it is our fault and we have to be the ones to fix it. Partners who say they love and support us may not be perfect but they put up with us so we love them even if they sometimes upset us, or treat us poorly. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re such a lot of work to deal with for them. \n\nIf any of this is even slightly ringing a bell for you, then the next thing you need to hear is this: \n\nAlmost every woman/girl with ASD that I know has been in an abusive relationship, or at least some very bad relationships where they were manipulated, used, and lied to by their partner. Very few were able to recognise it, because subtle manipulations slid over their heads until they were so used to the mistreatment they accepted it as normal. \n\nEvery comment you make is further cementing in my mind that your relationship is weep and truly in such a familiar pattern. \n\nPlease talk to someone you love and trust (not your husband) about all of the things you\u2019ve been saying here. If they tell you that this is mistreatment, listen to them. If you don\u2019t have someone you trust like that, listen to everyone here on reddit, telling you that this is not normal and this not okay.\n\nThe number of times I\u2019ve dodged bullets because a friend stepped in and told me what they were seeing that I was missing is significant.", "The point here is it shouldn't be you in the first place, OP. Your husband set you up to be the bad guy to Josh.", "Maybe you could try to emphasize that there was a miscommunication between you and your husband or something like that? And explain the facts as they are - it's fair to give the bigger space to the two persons who are sharing a room. Or even better, have your husband explain this to Josh. He's the one who messed this up, he should be the one to make things right.", "Josh has said before he appreciates me and has thanked me (I was very happy). He could also be in the heat of the moment. I'll ask him once he's calm if that's how he feels.", "This, your husband and you had an agreement, and your husband went back on that in front of the kids which made you the bad guy in Josh\u2019s eyes. Im not saying Josh is using you, because he\u2019s a kid, but his dad sure is (especially financially, see as he decided he needed a break from work)", "I don\u2019t see how you can call a child who has been failed repeatedly and is responding to yet another failure (in his mind) an asshole for being angry about it. Again, just because we know he shouldn\u2019t have directed his anger at OP doesn\u2019t mean he knew that, or he even has the coping skills to express his angry healthily. OP says he\u2019s actually a great kid, which makes me think even moreso that this wasn\u2019t a circumstance of asshole behavior but a reaction to stress. \n\nI\u2019m not going to change your mind I guess, but I hope that the other adults and people in Josh\u2019s life are more gracious than you are being, for his health and development.", "I get that part, but there's nothing else I can do. What's done is done. I just want to soothe and help Josh because he's upset right now and I feel like we're not understanding each other. My husband isn't helping and doesn't plan to since I'm the one who told Josh he can't have the basement.", "My husband said he's not getting involved because I was the one who told Josh otherwise.\n\nI'll try talking to my husband first, and if he say the same thing, I'll talk to Josh on my own.", "Josh no doubt is having a hard time and dealing with serious loss. Now he's upset because he feels like he's lost something else--something that should never have been in his mind was his to start with. \n\nYour husband has created this entire problem. It's not just a great disservice to you and your daugthers, it's downright mean and cruel to his son. \n\nHe was counting on you rolling over. He's a crap parent, a bad partner, and a stay at home dad who can't be bothered to stay home. I don't get it.", "Acting like an asshole in some situation doesn't condemn the whole person to complete and eternal assholeness. And that's what he was doing in this case, simple as that. I saw the message where OP told that he's usually a sweet kid and I have no reason to doubt that.", "Sorry, OP, but NO. There is PLENTY you can do with this deadbeat husband of yours. You're taking on responsibility for a situation your husband actively continues to create and refuses to step in and mitigate. This would be a deal breaker for me. I'd kick hubby out of the house. If I were gonna be my husband's bad guy for his kid, then I'd do it without his worthless ass around to make it worse.\n\nBut that's me.", "It sounds like your is husband is taking advantage of you. He knows:\n\n1. That you will take everyone at their word.\n2. That you can/will handle other things won\u2019t, either because they don\u2019t bother you enough to contest them or because you aren\u2019t aware of the subtext behind those things\n\nYour husband didn\u2019t tell you he had a son. He makes promises to his son behind your back and tells you to deal with the fallout. He is clearly either not supporting you or actively sabotaging your relationship with your stepson. I would be very, very curious about how he speaks about you with other people when you\u2019re not around, especially with your children.\n\nHe is not coming across as a supportive spouse. In fact, he\u2019s coming across as the exact opposite.", ">My husband said he's not getting involved because I was the one who told Josh otherwise.\n\n**He** was the one to promise Josh something you hadn't agreed to. \n\nThis is like promising a 5yo girl a unicorn and then having someone else explain that they aren't real.\n\nIdeally your husband should be involved in the repair, but he's likely to make things worse if he does anything...", "Your husband is an asshole."]}
