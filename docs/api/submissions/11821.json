I married my husband not knowing he had a son. I only found out about it AFTER my daughter turned 2. We've dated for 3 years, but not once did he mention his son. I never met his son before that. Even after our wedding and during my pregnancy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was the ex-girlfriend who came over to our house with Josh (he was 5 back then).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, after A LOT of counseling, talks, me going through and asking every single question there is--even the absurd ones--we figured it out. I went from livid about his omission, to just annoyed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJosh occasionally stays over throughout the 11 years since I was made aware of him, and throughout those times, he sleeps on our pullout couch. We lived in a two-bedroom apartment and had another girl. So my daughters--Anna 13 and Jane 10--shared a bedroom. I tried my best when it came to Josh, but he said he never saw me as his mom, which was fair to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJosh turned 16, and stuff went down with the court. I don't know the full details. All I know is that Josh's mom was deemed unfit. My husband said Josh had nowhere to go and can't stay at his aunt's forever. We're not rich, but we needed to make a plan. We moved into a two-bedroom house BUT with a furnished basement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we told the kids, my husband and I talked. I said that we should give the basement to the two girls since it's a bigger space to share. They will hit their teens, and I don't want them to feel cramped and seem like they don't have privacy from each other when they need it. Josh would be taking the bedroom upstairs. My husband agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day we move, he flipped it. He told Josh that he was getting the basement and that it would be all his, it was like a mini-living room, etc. I was livid and pulled my husband aside. He told me Josh was planning to stay here while he goes to college in the future, and it should be fair for him to get a bigger space. I said it's fine if he wants to stay, I'll give him that choice. But the girls are going to turn into teens. It's not fair for them to be cramped in a one bedroom and lack privacy from each other. He told me to tell Josh myself then. I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat down with Josh, I told him that the initial agreement was he can get the upstairs for as long as he needs. And that it has walk in closet and we can even install a TV for him--his gaming set up also fits with still a lot of room to play VR. Josh blew up on me. He called me asshole and said just because I wasn't his son, I shouldn't be taking his room away. He told me he was sick and tired of me always favoring the girls. Which in my opinion, I tried try best. I brought him with us on trips--the girls enjoy his company and look up to him--I paid for his school trips, I sat with him during A LOT of parent teacher conference. I called out from work when he was sick to take care of him. I tried my best. But I feel like I'm made the asshole in this situation.\n\n\nEdit: I called my mother and explained the situation. She lives far from me, but she told me that this isn't normal. I thought it was. And that I was getting taken advantage of. She was against my marriage but I never understood why till now. She told me to do things discretely. We agreed to a prenuptial, and the house is in my name. I'm not sure if I want divorce since I don't understand certain things. But I will keep it in mind. I don't know what will happen to Josh if we divorce.", "created_utc": 1678314530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mab50/aita_for_making_my_stepson_switch_bedrooms_with/", "score": 569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He let you make that major financial and emotional investment while lying to you, because he was telling his son the exact opposite. This is exactly what he did when he dated you, got engaged, and allowed you to make this serious investment into marrying him! His behavior has not changed. \n\nAnd then instead of accepting the responsibility of telling his son, he left it on you to do. Of course this would damage your relationship with the son! The 16-year-old had a messed up life with his entire family, and his deadbeat father promised him an apartment. Now his \"evil stepmother\" is telling him he has to give that up so HER daughters can have it. Of course he's not going to like you and we'll see you as favoring your daughters!  Your husband never should have put you in that position! She made you choose between following the agreement or looking like an ass to your stepson. What a terrible thing for a husband to do.\n\n*Just to clarify too, I don't think you're evil LOL. But of course the stepson is going to see you as the enemy because your husband made it that way! \n\nRegardless of if internet strangers think the stepson should have their room or the daughter should have the room (I'm actually on the fence), it's your husband's disgusting behavior that's causing the problems here!", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a massive A H, I am short of words.

I can't even call Josh an AH because it sounds like the kid's had it rough and is having trouble dealing. \n\nJust a word of advice - don't stay with someone you don't love for the kids.

That level of deception should be illegal. He went back on your agreement, gave his son the good news, then left it to you to give the bad news? That sounds like some kind of sociopathic manipulation. At the least, I\u2019d let your husband know he\u2019s on his last strike with you, and the next time it\u2019s absolutely attorney-time.", "Although you have a \u201cliving arrangements\u201d problem, you have a much bigger husband problem.

You don't need him, you are already supporting yourself.", "Your husband is the AH here\n\nTry to think of it from your step sons point of view. A father who didn't even bother to tell his wife about his existence, a mother who must have done something seriously wrong to be deemed unfit and now nowhere to go. He probably feels super powerless and vulnerable.\n\nShould he have screamed at you? No. But at the end of the day, I think your husband set him up for failure by giving him expectations of the basement to himself. He's to blame.", "NTA You're not the AH and neither is Josh, your jerk of a husband did this and honestly, I wonder if he didn't do it on purpose - he sounds pretty crappy. He hid his child, he's a stay at home parent for kids that are not home all day and you have to call in sick if one of the kids is sick?

Don't make your girls suffer because of him.  He started out your marriage lying and he's continuing to do so.  Josh is taking his cues from his dad.

I hate to throw around the \"DIVORCE NOW\" line, but honestly, you should. He's treating you like garbage and staying with him is teaching your girls what to expect from a man/partner.

You deserve better.", "Let him take his mental health break at the homeless shelter or get a job.", "Oh, it's actually worse than I thought. He is not even a SAHP, just a moocher.

Then you would have a better understanding what your best course of action might be - for you and for your girls.", "No No and a big fat No.  By allowing this you are setting your girls and Josh up for failure.

Refusing to work because he just feels like a break? Went back on your agreement about who gets what space, without discussing it?\n\nHusband needs to go. None of this is acceptable.\n\nETA: Would I be correct in thinking there's a big age gap in your relationship?", "Oof. Girl. Have some self respect :( your girls are watching you let this man walk all over you and they\u2019re gonna start doing the same thinking it\u2019s normal.

How does he expect you to help raise a child that he kept hidden from you, and now he\u2019s doing everything in his power to make Josh hate you? This is 1000% his business. It\u2019s his bio kid. And, he\u2019s putting his daughters on the back burner and ignoring their needs in order to be a hero to Josh. I get that Josh didn\u2019t have the best childhood with his mom, but that doesn\u2019t mean your husband gets to play favorites here.\n\nBottom line is that your husband isn\u2019t giving you the support you need in a situation you\u2019re going above and beyond in. For him to say it\u2019s none of his business is ridiculous.

Like seriously have some respect for yourself and your daughters.   What you are teaching them about healthy relationships?  Because this sure isn\u2019t one.   Keeping the fact that he had a child from you for years should have been the nail in the coffin.   How can you trust this person ever?   What are you teaching your daughters???

Yes, he didn\u2019t focus his anger in the right direction, but he\u2019s not TA for being angry and treating him like an adult who should be able to see reason in this scenario rather than a child who has been repeatedly abandoned by the adults in his life or been promised things that fell through isn\u2019t fair.", "And?

He hasn't been GOOD to you for a long time. This isn't normal.", "Ma\u2019am, as someone who also has ASD, I feel the need to tell you that you don\u2019t have a stepson problem, you have a your husband is using and manipulating you problem. \n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, and every other ASD woman I\u2019ve ever met - we\u2019re people pleasers, often to a fault. We struggle to always catch people\u2019s meaning, or pick up on \u2018vibes\u2019. We want those we care about to be honest and up front with us, because we are with them. A tendency to express affection and love through acts of service or taking on responsibility for them, because we often feel like we are not good at giving emotional support and forging connections through relating to people emotionally when they are struggling, but we try all that we can because we don\u2019t like feeling so cold and impotent. If someone is upset with us, we feel like it is our fault and we have to be the ones to fix it. Partners who say they love and support us may not be perfect but they put up with us so we love them even if they sometimes upset us, or treat us poorly. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re such a lot of work to deal with for them. \n\nIf any of this is even slightly ringing a bell for you, then the next thing you need to hear is this: \n\nAlmost every woman/girl with ASD that I know has been in an abusive relationship, or at least some very bad relationships where they were manipulated, used, and lied to by their partner. Very few were able to recognise it, because subtle manipulations slid over their heads until they were so used to the mistreatment they accepted it as normal. \n\nEvery comment you make is further cementing in my mind that your relationship is weep and truly in such a familiar pattern. \n\nPlease talk to someone you love and trust (not your husband) about all of the things you\u2019ve been saying here. If they tell you that this is mistreatment, listen to them. If you don\u2019t have someone you trust like that, listen to everyone here on reddit, telling you that this is not normal and this not okay.\n\nThe number of times I\u2019ve dodged bullets because a friend stepped in and told me what they were seeing that I was missing is significant.", "The point here is it shouldn't be you in the first place, OP. Your husband set you up to be the bad guy to Josh.", "Maybe you could try to emphasize that there was a miscommunication between you and your husband or something like that? And explain the facts as they are - it's fair to give the bigger space to the two persons who are sharing a room. Or even better, have your husband explain this to Josh. He's the one who messed this up, he should be the one to make things right.", "Josh has said before he appreciates me and has thanked me (I was very happy). He could also be in the heat of the moment. I'll ask him once he's calm if that's how he feels.", "This, your husband and you had an agreement, and your husband went back on that in front of the kids which made you the bad guy in Josh\u2019s eyes.

Again, just because we know he shouldn\u2019t have directed his anger at OP doesn\u2019t mean he knew that, or he even has the coping skills to express his angry healthily. OP says he\u2019s actually a great kid, which makes me think even moreso that this wasn\u2019t a circumstance of asshole behavior but a reaction to stress. \n\nI\u2019m not going to change your mind I guess, but I hope that the other adults and people in Josh\u2019s life are more gracious than you are being, for his health and development.", "I get that part, but there's nothing else I can do. What's done is done. I just want to soothe and help Josh because he's upset right now and I feel like we're not understanding each other.

He should definitely be included since he\u2019s family. As for the other things such as calling out of work to care for a sick child, that\u2019s what parents do.

Two people sharing a room meant for one, especially teens, is going to be a disaster. Especially with how hormonal teenage girls get. I fought constantly with my step sister when we shared a room.

You are smart, beautiful and intelligent.", "Would you mind saying how old you are & how old is your spouse?", "divorce is the best path for you and your daughters, i don\u2019t know what more you will need", "You don\u2019t need to worry about \u201ceveryone\u201d, you need to focus on you and your daughters.", "How old were you when you met? And how did you meet him?", "Alexithymia is extremely common among autistic people. You should talk to a therapist about developing your ability to identify and articulate your own emotions. And learn to trust them, even if your husband tries to tell you you're wrong somehow.", "I was only six when my parents split, so, at the time, I was scared and sad. But I was in my teens when someone first asked me if I wished they\u2019d stayed together and I laughed!\n\nI remember the fights. My dad wasn\u2019t a good person, and he treated my mom like shit. My mom is my best friend and I would have HATED to see her put up with him for even one more second on my \u201cbehalf\u201d.", "Yes yes yes! I really wanted to be the only person in my family who didn\u2019t divorce, but apparently we are all shit at choosing partners. I never want her to live the way I did.", "The sex isn't satisfying. I don't like touch as much and he doesn't listen when I don't like his touch.", "Oh, I'm officially diagnosed with ASD.", "Yeah, I'm 35 and my husband is 50.", "I met him when I was 19. I was attending a group where they help people with ASD navigate life. He was there as part of the staff. He talked to me and we kinda clicked.", "This.", "I saw you said you met him at 19, married him at 22, so by 24 you had a 2 year old and found out he had a 5 year old son. So the son would have been born around the time he met you? He was a 34 year old man already not accepting any kind of grown up responsibility by not evaluating his life when he became a father (maybe not even for the first time that he\u2019s aware of if this is his MO) and hiding that fact from you the entire time you knew each other and were dating. That\u2019s messed up.", "Oh for fuck\u2019s sake", "Please tell me you didn't start dating him when you were 19 and he was 34. Because he is just a predator and is currently using you. It is not normal for spouses to keep a secret child away from you, to not tell you his kid's court issues, and to not look after his own children and financially support you. Please take all the Redditors' advice and leave now.", "Yeah.. he took advantage of you.", "...I did not think about it that way. Jesus christ...It just clicked and made sense. Oh my God, thank you for pointing that out. For years, I did not do the math.", "That's the same reaction my mom had. Is that an issue? I asked my mom and she was just baffled, and sighed.", "One redditor just wrote that Josh was born when he met me. I did not do that math. Everything is making sense right now.\n\nI dated him when I was 19 and he was 34. He said I was mature because of my autism, and that we were on the same level.", "I dont understand. Can you help me understand how I was taken advantage?", "Yes, because you married a liar and a loser it seems", "OP sorry I\u2019m going to be cold but it\u2019s time to get a divorce. Your husband gets money, a roof, childcare and a much younger wife while you\u2019re on Reddit asking strangers how to deal with his lies.", "Ahh the classic line of predators, \"you're mature for your age,\" now with a spinkle of something else (your autism). \n\nYou weren't mature for your age, HE was immature for his age. To add to that, you have grown and he had not. Now you're 34 and he at 50 is still stuck at 19.", "I'm not sure I understand how you didn't do the math before? What exactly has he told you regarding his son after keeping it from you and you found out? And did no one in your life seriously bring up the very concerning age gap and all his red flags to you? Is there a reason he refuses to work and parent?", "You were 19 and based on your comments there\u2019s a 15 year age gap? So he was 34 at the time? He was a staff member at a group for people with ASD to navigate life. Im not fully educated on ASD however I\u2019ve read your comments and it sounds like there\u2019s a very clear power dynamic here. So from what it looks like to me, is he saw someone a lot younger than him who he could easily manipulate. And he did, he successfully hid a child from you until after you were married, now he\u2019s decided to \u201ctake a break\u201d from work, it doesn\u2019t sound like he does much around the house and now look, the house is in YOUR name and he backed out of an agreement you made and makes you the bad guy in your stepsons eyes", "It never crossed my mind, my asd kinda makes it difficult to think through things. He said he didn't know he had a son. Turns out that was a lie. He said he kept it from me because he was scared that I would leave. Whenever I hung out with my friends, he would be there. He would make us leave if my friends spoke about our relationship. He refuses to work because he said his mental health is bad. He said he parents by picking up the kids from school, cooking and playing with them.", "Oh. I still have a lot to learn. May I ask,  is it THAT bad that he approached me when he was 34? He said I had the same mental maturity as him. I just want to dig this through my head."]}
