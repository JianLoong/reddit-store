Addy F17 , Lena F17 & Sammy F18. They are all cousins. \n\nI\u2019ve always been really close to my nieces,  we\u2019re not too far apart in age so they look at me more of a friend than their aunt.  \n\nAddy is my brothers daughter, while lena & Sammy are my two sisters kids. \n\nFor some reason my SIL & her family hated that Addy spent more time with her dads side & prefered being around us. They believed I was getting Addy against them (just because she refused to parent her younger siblings (5 under 7), she also had a sister around her age Alayah who was closer with them then us. \n\nLong story short, addy\u2019s mom, aunt & grandma spent years being awful to her in every way.  She didn\u2019t feel sfe around them from 13 to 15.  my parents took her in & I would spend a lot of time with her.  I went to all her games, helped her with school work, took her on trips with my friends & helped her financially. \n\nAt 15 she said she wants to build a relationship with her moms family & thought it would be best she didn\u2019t spend alot of time with us. She said she believes they mistreated her because they are jealous of our relationship. I completely supported that & told her to hmu if she needed anything.  \n\nThroughout that time, she\u2019d come over few times a month or call me when things were getting hard at home & request money often. It was all good and her relationship with her mom / extended family was getting better. \n\nLast summer, her younger sister Alayah 15 started hanging out with us more & told me she wished to spent more time growing up but her aunts would tell to keep away from us. Anywho, the more she spent with us, the harder they also made her life.  I told her things would eventually get better since it did for Addy & she said the only reason they are nice to her is because Addy started shit talking us & basically told her moms family she hated us & that we blackmailed her to hate them.  I was obviously shocked & asked her why she said that she denied it at first but eventually said she knew it would fix her relationship\u2026  she apologized for lying & said she would t do it again. \n\nA few weeks ago I heard a recording from her basically calling me a b***h and that she pretends to like me because I\u2019m stupid enough to spend money on her despite her not being around us anymore & her mom / aunt were laughing. Alayah (who showed me the recording) asked me not to say anything\n\nI respected Alayah\u2019s wishes & decided to not tell her I knew. I don\u2019t plan on attending her graduation but will go to her cousins. My fiance and I are surprising my nieces with a huge grad trip. Booking it this weekend & decided I won\u2019t include her.  I told my family and they are torn. Some say I won\u2019t be the AH because I spent years looking out for her & she disrespected me in return. But others say I should be the bigger person & take her.", "created_utc": 1673304136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107sm5c/wibta_for_declining_an_invite_to_my_nieces/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t have to help a person who backstabs and trash talks you.", "INFO: Where the fuck is your brother in all this?!?  It\u2019s his daughter too and he is conspicuously absent from your post.\n\nI say this because your family dynamics are\u2026.strange.  It\u2019s like two teams pitted against each other (SIL side vs your brother\u2019s side) and the poor kids seem like pawns.\n\nTo be fair, and this is based only on your account of the situation, you aren\u2019t trying to play this tug of war and merely want what is best for the kids. What you are not seeing, in my opinion, is the way that you are falling right into their trap and playing their game.  \n\nIt\u2019s a weird tangled web of a mess, but I think you need to remember that you are trying to do the right thing and need to bring some of the nonsense to light.  Starting with a conversation with Alayah, who is a child and doesn\u2019t understand that some information, once revealed, cannot be kept under wraps.  Because, while you are not wrong to exclude Addy from the trip in light of this recording, you absolutely should make her aware of her own role in that decision.  She needs to know that you love her and have always wanted what is best for her and are disappointed to hear how she really feels about you.  \n\nThen again, your brother should really be dealing with the weird game his wife and in-laws have dragged his children into.", "NTA. You\u2019ve supported her for years and then she just disrespects you like that. If she asks where her gifts are, tell her it\u2019s all the money you spent on her when she never appreciated it.", "NTA but your brother's in-laws (and potentially him if he's in the picture) sure are.\n\nThis feels like a case of FAFO.  She has decided to choose her mother's side of the family over you and this is a fair consequence as she's using you.\n\nIf you do follow through and do not take her (which I wouldn't do in your shoes) you should make sure that you have a sufficient cover story to protect Alayah.  Maybe something like you don't want to invite her because it will alienate her from her mother and you just don't want to risk making it bad for her.\n\nSimilar with the money and any other asks she has in the future, suddenly you should become nervous about giving her stuff because it might affect her relationship with her mom's side if they found out and you want to 'protect' her.", "She\u2019s been talking shit about you and calling you awful names. She even insulted you when you\u2019ve always been there for her.\n\nI guess we\u2019ll see who feels stupid when you, your fianc\u00e9, and your nieces are away on a relaxing vacation without her.\n\nShe should have thought long and hard about the things she did. She made the choices she made. No one else forced her to make them. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you if you don\u2019t want it to bite back.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. A gift should be whatever you feel, it\u2019s completely your choice.\n\nBut on a side note - what does your brother have to say about all this? And why is he okay with his wife and in-laws (and daughter) being so hateful toward you?", "Nta but yikes on never calling cps on your abusive relatives and instead returning your nieces to that house year after year and expecting them to grow into anything but toxic wasters themselves.", "NTA. Absolutely do not take her or give her anything else. Not even any more of your time.", "NTA \n\nOP you have to ask yourself, if someone doesn't like you - \" her basically calling me a b***h and that she pretends to like me because I\u2019m stupid enough to spend money on her despite her not being around us anymore & her mom\" - why would Addy want to be around a b**** on a trip?\n\nNot taking Addy will be doing her a favor. Let her know you don't want to ruin her graduation or post-graduation experience, so you will not inflict yourself on her.", "Nta\n\nFunny how people want you to be the bigger person with your money. \n\nI don't know how long you'll be able to keep the reasoning a secret, but damn does that child deserve the shock of a lifetime.", "NTA.  Assuming you have confidence that the recording is legit, inviting Addy is a hard no in my book.  Her behavior is appalling.  \n\nThat said, I get why Addy has done what she\u2019s done.  The adults in her life on her mom\u2019s side put her in an awful position, and she had to figure out some self-preservation.  She is still young, although she gets less benefit of the doubt than a younger child. \n\nSo, I would seriously consider using this as a learning opportunity for Addy about behavior, consequences, trust, and boundaries.  Have a real conversation with her.  Tell her she has admitted she knows bad mouthing you and treating you like this is wrong, she said she wouldn\u2019t do it again, yet you know she has.  Her behavior is not acceptable, is not a healthy way to conduct herself in relationships with others, and has broken your trust.  But she has a right to do as she wishes, and she has.  You also have a right to do as you wish, and that is to pause and step back from a relationship with her.  You need time and space from her, say at least six months, although in the future your door will open if she chooses to apologize sincerely and show meaningful change.  \n\nGood luck, OP", "I don\u2019t have a judgment, because this family dynamic is clearly deeply complicated and terrible, but I hope that at some point you can just tell her how hurt you are by what she did, and that she\u2019ll be in a position to actually hear it. She\u2019s at the exact age where she\u2019s probably so desperate for her family\u2019s approval that she would backstab you without really thinking about what it means, and I hope in future years she can get some distance from her terrible terrible immediate family and you two can patch up your relationship.", "YWNBTA\n\nIt's unfortunate, but this is a lesson for this child to learn. You have no idea what the truth of the situation is here. You really need to speak to the child, but I don't see how much help that will be if the other side of the family is so against you.\n\nYou are under no obligation to gift her anything. And, since you know of what she's said, simply remind her of her words when she gets upset that she's not coming on the road trip.\n\nKids need to face consequences for their actions the same way adults do. The consequence of her being 2faced is that you don't want to spend time with her. Her fault, not yours.", "NTA for not taking her on the grad trip for sure. But it sounds like she\u2019s been raised in a pretty shitty household and it seems she probably only said these things because she missed her family. Not ideal, but she\u2019s still a kid", "NTA, because she has done it to herself.  Time for NC with Addy AND your SIL.  And please update us with your decision, and how it (Addy not going, if that becomes your final choice) was received.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t include her either. You\u2019ll just give her more ammo to mock you with. I\u2019d prune off that whole branch of the family tree. Fr, cut that \u201cbigger person\u201d idea of their\u2019s tf out your head.", "NTA\n\nWords and actions have consequences, a lesson she should have learned before now, since it appears she hasn't, this may help!", "NTA. I can't imagine the character she'll turn into once she's a little older with how she's treating the people that cared and loved her. She thought she's smart to be a manipulative AH and use you for money while back stabbing your kindness. Action and consequences and all that should apply here. Don't condone such horrible behavior because it'll only get worst.", "NTA \n\nYou get to gift who you like whatever you like!\n\nThis is a kid who lived with you for years and was basically abused and gaslighted as a kid to the point she left her mother and Aunts. Then those same toxic mother and aunts have blackmailed her into saying bad things for a reward. \n\nYou aren\u2019t wrong. \n\nBut this is also a kid that has an entire life of abuse and blackmail thrown at her. \n\nHonestly I would talk to her honestly about how you feel. Tell her you aren\u2019t coming to her graduation and tell her why you aren\u2019t inviting her on this trip as you feel very disrespected for the love you have given \n\nBut leave the door open for reconciliation with her, just take the money out of the equation until you build a relationship! \n\nThe money has taught her that you are \u201cbuying her love\u201d because of the toxic environment of her Mother and Aunts. Give her the space to appreciate the things you did by taking them away but not in anger, more in sadness. And leave the door open for her.", "Ugh, I mean. You're the grown ups and she's the kid so it WOULD be really magnanimous and you would 100% be the bigger person to look beyond her poor choices and her behavior... but... you don't really have to.\n\nIt depends on how much you think she MEANT what she said. If you feel like the recording was her real feelings and she's been using you all this time then, no, absolutely not, you do not need to include her in anymore family expenditures. She clearly picked a side of the fence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever if there's even a part of you that thinks that this is just a stunt to gain her Mother's/Mother's family's approval and acceptances. Than don't push her out yet, she still needs you she's just young and impressionable and not a really thinking of anything other than how to protect herself from bullies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's up to you, but can I recommend TALKING to her before the graduation. You don't need to say you heard a recording you don't need to say your other niece told you anything. You just need to sit her down and ask her if she truly loves and respects you to either be honest with you or to stop speaking disrespectfully about you to her other side of the family. That it's hurtful and unfair and not acceptable no matter what.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, you don't HAVE to invite anyone to anything, you're an aunt not a parent or step parent. I'm sorry this sucks. You sound like a very kind and loving person, I'm sure this hurt you a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add verdict: NTA", "NTA. Fool around and find out, Addy", "NTA, you spent year being emotionally and financially supportive of your niece only to have her disrespect and call you names behind your back. She claims that it is just to \"fix\" her relationship with her mother and that side of her family, but that does not make it better or true. Your niece has made a choice, therefore she can accept that choices have consequences.", "NTA. Talk about betrayal. Fuck her. She made her decision you've seen the proof I'd call it one on the relationship.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m what world are you an AH for leaving a trash mouthed brat out of a good time?  She used you specifically as a punching bag to get in good with \u201cthe other side\u201d saying she\u2019s using you as an ATM that she lies to for fun. Either she\u2019s lying to you or she\u2019s lying to them and considering she promised not to do it again and didn\u2019t follow through my money is on you. \n\nShow her that what she\u2019s doing has consequences because she absolutely knows what she\u2019s doing. Next time she asks for money let her know the ATM is closed for good. \n\nI mean she wouldn\u2019t want to take money from a stupid b**** right?  /s", "You pick your battles, maybe not one I would pick.  I would say NTA but I wouldn't have rocked the family boat given there was already tension.", "Info: has she ever said why she said those things? It sounds as though she felt she had to in order to fit in with her mom and that side of the family. Why does that side of the family dislike you and your family so much? This one\u2019s hard. \n\nPreliminary, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, but I\u2019m wondering if this is more about a young adult trying to fit in with estranged family members and not knowing how to do so in a productive manner. She could just be copying language that\u2019s used in that household in an effort to fit in and while that doesn\u2019t make it right, it might make it understandable.", "YWBTA if you do what you are saying.\n\n1. Alayah will be blamed.\n2. Addy, upon being surprised and hurt, will lash out, most likely at her sister.\n\nSuggestion - meet with Addy now. Tell her that, although you were glad that she told you the truth about badmouthing her before, you're not comfortable including her on a graduation celebration trip with her cousins.\n\nIf I were you, I would do that before booking the trip in case she says something to change your mind.\n\nAddy may currently be trapped in an abusive household and could be behaving the way she is out of self-preservation. You can't know how she actually feels without talking to her.\n\nIf you tell her you won't be including her and she immediately gets angry and spiteful, you'll know she was using you.

You're not harming her, you're just not giving her an extravagant gift she doesn't deserve.\n\nThat being said... do you know first-hand what your in-laws are doing?  Because Addy is explicitly shit-talking you to them, lying to you about it, and then claiming she just did it to keep them happy.  It seems entirely likely that she's doing the reverse as well: shit-talking them to you and lying to them about it.  You know that part of that is true, because she's falsely claiming you blackmailed her into hating them.  \n\nBasically, nothing your niece is doing seems solidly truthful.  WHY she feels the best thing to do is to lie to both sides and try to pit them against each other is a whole different question.  Is it a defense mechanism to cope with abuse?  Is it a mental illness?  Is she just a kinda shitty person who thinks it's the best way to get things from you?

Frankly you know that the entire time growing up your niece(s) has been in an impossible position, due to your SIL's family, and are still maturing. While what she said is undoubtedly upsetting and rude to you, high schoolers lying to try to fit in is unfortunately not abnormal.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying about shining some light on the whole toxic shenanigans.  I guess it\u2019s ESH a little bit, because the kids (willingly or not) were put in a position where they are almost gathering intel on the other side when bouncing around for visits.  They probably love and feel loyalty to both sides of the family but have just conditioned themselves to talk badly about the other side as a coping mechanism.  At some point, all of the adults in the family should have gotten together and hashed it out, like adults.  Grow up and start mediating this shit.\n\nThat\u2019s where I think OP just kind of cutting out Addy is only going to make it worse.  She is wrong, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she has had a lot of positive role modeling when it comes to conflict resolution.  And Alayah seems to be on the same path."]}
