I hated his first wife, as did the rest of my family, he didn\u2019t listen and got married anyway, we found out that she wasn\u2019t the best in certain ways, so they got divorced. \n\nNow, I also am not the biggest fan of this woman he\u2019s wanting to get married to. This woman, let\u2019s call her \u201cJane\u201d, used to be best friends with my brothers ex wife. We have known her for a while, but our family never got super close with her. They\u2019ve been together for 6 months and announced that they are engaged and getting married. Which, good for them, but the whole point is that I know my boyfriend is not going to be invited. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years, and he has met majority of my family and really close friends. They all love him, and let him know that he is apart of the family. The thing is, my relationship is an age gap relationship, so my brother doesn\u2019t like him, and my step dad doesn\u2019t either, simply because there is an age gap (my boyfriend is 45). They are the only people in my family who never want to meet him, and who refuse to like or acknowledge him. Now I\u2019m not very close with my brother to begin with, especially recently but for other reasons, but if my boyfriend is not invited then I don\u2019t want to go at all. \n\nMy boyfriend has been very patient with my family, we both had to be since we knew it would startle them. Some were okay from the beginning, others took their time and saw that he was a good man. He is my person, through and through. I know that he won\u2019t be invited, and I don\u2019t want to go if he\u2019s not welcome. I know my mom will think I\u2019m being rude and that I should go because he\u2019s my \u201cbrother\u201d but like I said, I\u2019m not at all close to him, and my mother will always defend my brother no matter what he does. My sister agrees with me, and believes that they have had plenty of time to make their peace with it, and my boyfriend has done more than enough to prove to them that he\u2019s a good guy. So Am I the A-hole for not wanting to go?", "created_utc": 1675623578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ukb5w/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Every other person in our family loves my boyfriend and sees him as family. \n\nI know my mother, step dad, brother and his fianc\u00e9 will think that I\u2019m the a-hole here. but they won\u2019t invite the person that I am with because of their own pride. They are angry because of his age, and that I made this choice. Which is not fair. I\u2019ve done nothing but prove my entire life that I never go into anything without thinking it through. My boyfriend has done nothing but prove to my family that he is a good guy and doesn\u2019t want to cause any harm or trouble. \n\nI don\u2019t believe that I am the a-hole.

He can invite whoever he wants to his wedding, but you can refuse to go without your SO. As someone who's been there, though: it's very easy to think your boyfriend is 'the one' at your age, especially if he was your first serious relationship. And I'm sure he's lovely and all, but the age gap is significant. What is a 40-yo doing with a 20-yo? Why can't he find a woman his own age? I used to date a much older man and I used to think it was fine because I was so mature, but once the relationship finished, I realized there were lots of reddish flags I missed about him because I had little experience and tbh I was flattered that an older man found me interesting & I could keep up with his friends etc. Please be careful.", "YTA - not for choosing to not attend the wedding, but for your hypocrisy.

You\u2019ve told us very little of your boyfriend and one of those things is extremely concerning, especially to those who love you.  I\u2019m not judging, but it is incredibly, incredibly rare to have an equal & healthy partnership when there is such a large age gap.  Your family has valid concern and I would hope you\u2019d attempt to see where they\u2019re coming from. \n\nEither way though, don\u2019t be a hypocrite.

He can choose who to invite to his wedding and you can choose not to go because they didn\u2019t invite him. There are consequences to both sides either way it ends up going down.

Feel free not to go, either way it will be a fight.", "NAH\n\nHe can invite whoever he wants, and you can go or decline.\n\nThe question is: would it be worse for you if you went (because you\u2019d have to go alone) or would it be worse if you didn\u2019t go (because your family would judge and nag you) - I\u2019m not trying to steer you in any direction, I\u2019m just saying think about what will be better for you \n\nBut him not trusting your boyfriend because of the age difference doesn\u2019t make him an asshole, he is trying to look out for you. I\u2019m not saying there is something wrong with your relationship, and I\u2019m not saying that your boyfriend is predatory, but a huge age difference like this, especially when one of the two people involved is so young (you got together when you were 20, that\u2019s barely being an adult) has a certain vibe. Maybe you\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re in your forties yourself", "YTA.  Ignoring the age difference of you and your boyfriend, the first half of the post is you ranting about how you didn\u2019t like or approve of your brothers first wife and now don\u2019t like his second wife. And you are are angry that he does like your boyfriend. Sounds like your hole family just has issues getting along and minding their own business. Maybe your brother and his future wife are better off if you don\u2019t attend if you have no intention of getting along with her anyways.", "I wonder why your brother doesn't want to be around the guy that groomed you at 20 when he was 42?

You are in a long-term relationship and if the SOs of other family members are invited, then your brother is deliberately excluding your partner from the family. Also, the age gap between two adults who love each other is literally no one's business but their own.", "ESH how many people live in your town that you're both with total freaks", "NTA - declining because your longterm partner isn\u2019t invited is a legitimate excuse. \n\nI understand why your brother is unhappy with your relationship. 22 years is a huge age gap. However, we tend to forget that the age gap itself is not the problem, it\u2019s that the age gap can be indicative of a problematic dynamic in the presence of other red flags. So your family being weary is understandable, and both them and you should keep an eye out for those red flags. Your brother\u2019s refusal to meet him after 3 years just because of the age gap is a problem for me. Because if he was truly worried about you he would want to meet him so he could see if those red flags exist and try to point them out or protect you. He  doesn\u2019t want to do that, he just wants to judge the relationship without knowing what it is he is actually judging. \n\nI AM going to give you the mom talk. Remember your relationship should lift you up not contain you, so watch out for controlling behavior. Don\u2019t give problematic behavior\u2019s a pass just because he treats you better than your last bf. Less bad behavior isn\u2019t good, it\u2019s still just bad behavior. Don\u2019t fall into middle age habits because that is where he is in life, for the relationship to be equal you both need to do things you find fulfilling and he should support that. Finally, if friends/family point out specific problematic behaviors hear them out. In the best of times it\u2019s hard to see the truth in our own relationships, with a significant age gap, he has had many more years to figure out how to hide them, and you don\u2019t have enough experience yet to know all the ways they can be hidden. I now feel that I\u2019ve done my due diligence, so good luck.", "NTA - The brother can send an invitation you can opt to not attend since your long term partner is not included. \n\nWhy are men dating younger adult women called predators while women dating younger adult males called cougars??? I think as an adult you date people for common likes and interests and two consenting adults should be able to date without name calling or labels. \n\nThis post wasn\u2019t asking anyone\u2019s thoughts on her relationship but rather if she should attend a wedding where her partner of 3 years was excluded. His age doesn\u2019t matter.", "nta for not wanting to go to your brother's wedding.\n\nAnd now for the unpopular opinion: I know of a couple where the guy is double the age of the girl.

You don\u2019t like his fianc\u00e9, he doesn\u2019t like your boyfriend. People are entitled to their own opinions but you having this double standard makes YTA.", "NTA still \u2026. This post is not about their ages it\u2019s about an invitation for a wedding. She isn\u2019t asking advice on her relationship to her boyfriend. And personal feelings about their ages are irrelevant. OP has the right to RSVP no because her long term partner is not included and the brother has a right to invite who he wants at his wedding. A wedding invitation is not a judicial summons and can be denied for what ever reason.", "You know, you're quite the hypocrite.  You're all full of judgment for your brothers relationship, but you refuse to listen to any judgement about your creepy predator boyfriend.  Pot, meet kettle.", "I haven\u2019t said anything yet, I\u2019m planning on it though. I would never throw it in my brothers face, i would just explain that I\u2019m not going to attend", "Damn, this is a bigger age gap than me and my oldest child! I'm 39, and they are 19 years-old.", "I actually agree that shouldn\u2019t be a term, this is just my relationship. Also, they have never met my boyfriend. They actually refuse to. My family has tried talking to them about it, saying that they need to meet him in order to come up with their opinion, and that he\u2019s a good guy. They just refuse. They don\u2019t know the kind of person he is, or what he is like. It\u2019s like judging a book by its cover.", "Ya but he probably wasn\u2019t having sex in college, which could explain how he ended up with OP", "If you believe you know that he is, please explain in every detail how that is true, other than the fact that he is in a relationship with me. He\u2019s a good guy, if you haven\u2019t had good relationship experiences then I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all men are bad. I promise", "In fairness if she was over 18 when they met he doesn\u2019t get to be called a predator. I think it\u2019s a little weird and I think men who go after really young women need to be looked questionably but she is an adult", "You\u2019re right, it is hypocritical of me because I don\u2019t like his fianc\u00e9. But, I have reasonings behind me not liking her. My family once again doesn\u2019t like her as well, they don\u2019t believe they should be getting married. It\u2019s not just me, but you are right. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of his fianc\u00e9", "OP: I\u2019ve had one relationship before this and it was bad! I won\u2019t do that again! \nAlso OP: *dates a man old enough to be her father* I\u2019ll spend my life with him!!", "Well...there is something fundamentally wrong with a person who cannot get a partner their own age.  There is a reason that those people go for someone so much younger than them, and it's isn't that you are just an angel returned from heaven that they couldn't stand to live without.  It's because they have red flag behaviors that people their own age don't put up with.", "I would also refuse because I wouldn\u2019t want my sister to think I\u2019m enabling her dating a predator. He is too old to be dating someone as young as you.", "Ffs, no one's saying all men are bad, we're grossed out by the difference in age. He's literally one year shy of being twice your age. He's been able to legally consume alcohol and smoke cigarettes for your entire existence. He could have gathered a child or two that are older than you are. That's creepy and gross. Sure, he may be nice to you and your family by the standards set by your red(der) flag ex, but the vast difference in age is disgusting. With his age comes lived experience and an expectation of maturity, which I have a hard time imagining he has. \n\nJust as a thought experiment, look at the 18 year old young men around you and pretend for a moment that your boyfriend isn't in the picture; would you date them? Probably not because they lack maturity compared to where you are in life. Now, why would a man with FOUR TIMES that gap look at you as a quality partner? Probably not because he sees an equal.\n\nOr worse, he does", "Don\u2019t project on other people. A rational person would say this age gap is in appropriate. There is nothing in that comment suggesting the other person has had bad experiences. \n\nIf anything the onus is on you to provide proof that your 43 year old boyfriend was not a predator when he chose to enter into a relationship with a 20 year old.", "And you dont see how this is hypocritical of you?", "Yah, and your brother and soon-to-be-wife has their reasoning behind them.", "Right. This post is wild. The dude was 22 before she was even born.", "Well if my 20 year old daughter started dating a 40+ year old man, I\u2019d be thoroughly disgusted too and definitely wouldn\u2019t want to support that relationship. There is nothing your boyfriend can say to make him justify why he chased someone over half his age. \nYou 2 are in very different places in life, such an age gap at your age usually means an unhealthy power balance and dynamics.", "Respectfully, I disagree. Once again, his age doesn\u2019t make him a bad person. I\u2019ve met his family, I\u2019ve met his friends. He is a genuine good guy. Shit happens in life. Neither of us expected to be in this kind of relationship, but here we are. There are definitely men out there that are predators, and that are terrible men. But they can range at pretty much all ages when dating. Just like women can. It is still possible to find good people though.", "I chose not to state why I am not fond of her. I don\u2019t want to talk shit on her, or bash her. I am not her biggest fan, for reasons. It is true, I don\u2019t like his fianc\u00e9, he doesn\u2019t like my boyfriend. Only difference, I have a valid reasoning behind my opinions, and it\u2019s not just me, my family feels the same way about her. I\u2019m simply asking if it make me rude to not attend the wedding when my long term boyfriend isn\u2019t welcome", "Of course you disagree.  You're still young and don't get it.  And you refuse to listen to sense.  I don't blame your brother for having a problem with it.  Any mature, logical person would.  But, hopefully you grow up and realize it.   And hopefully you grow up before something terrible happens to you because of that predator.", "OP, where/how/when did you MEET your boyfriend?", "I'd argue that not wanting to meet a man who very likely groomed your sister is actually a pretty valid reason. And just to clarify, victims of grooming don't tend to know they've been groomed.", "Then say the reasons - otherwise this just makes you sound petty.", "I\u2019ve been in an unhealthy and bad relationship before. I know the signs. I know what it\u2019s like. I\u2019ve also known men who were actual predators. Thank you for your opinion, but once again, he\u2019s not a bad guy, and I\u2019m not some child", "My brothers ex wife was abusive towards him, and cheated. His current fianc\u00e9 (the ex wife\u2019s ex best friend) was perfectly content on remaining her best friend, even after she physically abused a man multiple times. She saw what happened, and still remained friends with her. That, along with other reasons. So no, I don\u2019t like her.", "You... You do realise groomers target young women who have had bad relationships because they're a lot easier to manipulate right? Everyone who has been groomed and is in a relationship with the person that has groomed them doesn't believe that THEIR older man is a predator. Every. Single. One of them.", "You have been in one other relationship based on your other answers. One other relationship doesn't make you an expert on all the red flags, I'm sorry. Truly hope you will get out of this relationship before he traps you in a marriage.", "The signs such as...isolating you from your family? Making sure he's more of a priority to you to the extent that you skip your own brother's wedding? YTA", "Ugh? That\u2019s between your brother and her. You don\u2019t necessarily know everything she know.\n\nFurthermore she clearly chose your brother over her best friend.\n\nNot the same.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call your boyfriend a predator but he is not wrong for being concerned", "He is literally marrying her now. But \"for reasons\" you're adamant that it's okay to not like her. It's also okay not to like your sister/daughter being groomed and manipulated.\n\nStop digging in. Be open to being wrong.", "Uhhh no. I\u2019m very close to all of my family. Like I said, I\u2019ve never been close to my brother. My boyfriend actually wants me going to the wedding, so.."]}
