Who would want to spend their lunch break around people policing their every food choice?", "NTA.\n\nthat girl clearly struggles with disordered eating so to a certain point is understandable. my best friend suffered from anorexia and it was pretty bad for like two years and he would be the same way: over critical to himself and others, extremely sensitive around the topic of food. going out for lunch was out of the picture and eventually he started to drift apart because it was becoming a problem for others (is a mixture between being annoyed and being worried about the person)\n\nyou did well by being honest, as long as your respectful. if you care enough, maybe at some time tey to talk to her and bring some sense to her. food and dieting is a very sensitive topic and while her food choices are hers only to do, she needs to be careful about how she discusses this topics in front of others.", "NTA.  Carly seems to have boundary problems going both ways, meaning not only does she overshare, she pushes other people's boundaries to a ridiculous degree.  She created this entire situation, first by monopolizing your lunch conversations, then by refusing to take a polite excuse for an answer (She checked your calendar?!  Who DOES that?!) then pestering you until you finally told her the truth, then got offended and again monopolized the luncheon, in reverse, by being very obvious about her \"not talking.\"  Bottom line, Carly really wants to be the center of attention and control things one way or another.  You are NTA here, but I think she's going to get a few more miles out of this drama.  I hate to say it, but my guess is that there's more to come.  Don't be too shocked if your other lunchmates suddenly start getting dragged into this.", "NAH\n\nShe tried to acommodate when you fianlly voiced your concern so not an AH and you are also not an AH because it can be difficult to bring up that you are uncofortable with someone you just have to work closely with. \n\nShe should maybe work on her issues seeing as she was unable to participate in any other conversation than her diet. It doesn' t seem likethe diet does her that much good tbh.", "NAH.\n\nWhile it is possible that Carly views these lunches as a way to help strengthen her resolve to not eat, that isn't fair on the rest of you and I am completely behind you on opting out of that. However, workplace lunches can be really valuable, and if Carly is going to not make them about not eating then I think you should try to go to another of these lunches, and go prepared with a bunch of conversational starters (read the general news, read some industry news). Ensure the conversation continues, try to have a good time and try not to be wrapped up in whether Carly is participating in the conversation or not.\n\nWith respect to Carly, try to make the most generous assumption you can for her most recent behaviour. Low blood sugar, perhaps? And forgive her.Try to find non food topics to talk with her about.", "NTA and handled this amazingly!", "out loud or silent, nobody likes the food police. nta.", "I have been out to lunch with someone who is addicted to fad diets and was doing an intermittent fast. \n\nBut she just drank her herbal tea and made polite conversation like a grown up.", "Why would OP need to bend over backwards to accommodate someone that clearly has severe issues, in need of professional help, and can\u2019t even act remotely socially acceptable? No, OP should not need to spend time \u201cpreparing\u201d in order to have a normal lunch with coworkers.", "NTA and I think she has an eating disorder.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s having big feelings about realizing how insufferable she\u2019s been acting and that you were the only one who had the courage to tell her about it. But that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. As someone in recovery from BN, Carly sounds as if she has, at minimum, disordered eating or serious issues with calorie consumption and self image. This is very sad for her but when she makes that her entire conversation and places her own issues on to others to the point that people feel they should justify their diet or eating habits then frankly she needs therapy. She\u2019s not well and she needs professional level help if she\u2019s going to get better. She is acting unprofessionally with colleagues, making people uncomfortable, covertly judging their eating habits and controlling their food choices and if I were you I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat with her either.  My therapist would tell me \u2018time to make a choice. Go to lunch knowing she WILL bring up food and be judging you, even if she doesn\u2019t say so outright, and will try to control your eating which puts you at risk or put your own health first and go eat elsewhere to get your food in sans judgement. It is Carly\u2019s choice to eat as she does and your choice whether you allow her to control your meal or not.\u201d \n\n\nFYI, I\u2019m not judging Carly. I think she is sick, not maliciously controlling. She may not even be aware that she\u2019s trying to control others. Like Carly, I eat one full balanced meal (I have a meal plan worked out with the doc) in the evening with my partner because I can be relaxed, take time to prepare the food and enjoy it and he can help me if I\u2019m struggling. Eating at work is much harder- my job is 24/7 because I work in education and eating on site is always communal like in the school cafeteria or with the students- so my colleagues know I stick to water and coffee and maybe a small snack like fruit or a biscuit while at work. I don\u2019t judge them for eating or draw attention to my not eating. If it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday or a celebration or someone\u2019s makes a \u2018it\u2019s not the end of term yet but we are all hanging so here\u2019s a pick me up\u2019 cake then I have a small slice without making a big deal out of it. Carly doesn\u2019t sound well at all and if I worked with her, I\u2019d avoid any time spent with her and food because she\u2019d trigger the hell out of me and it\u2019s too easy to slide back down the rabbit hole. \n\n\nYou handled this with tact and respect, privately, without embarrassing her. You pointed out her bad habit of conversation focusing on other peoples food and her own restriction without blaming her for ruining your collective appetites or being insensitive. You are not obligated to eat lunch with her or be more that professionally civil which you are. Carly is just upset that people are very aware of how she acts, she\u2019s embarrassed and maybe upset that she\u2019s been rumbled at her control game.", "NTA. Listening to someone go on and on every lunch hour is trying. She has no social skills if she can't find something else to rank about. She needs to realize that people are tired of her.", "This. I thought the exact same thing as someone in recovery from an ED. \nShe is projecting. \nShe needs help from a therapist with training in ED.", "Work lunches are very valuable for networking. Having conversational topics that are more interesting than potential eating disorders can make redirecting the conversation onto safer more interesting topics easier. Having some interesting topics ahead of time is a useful strategy when trying to change the existing conversational dynamics from something unpleasant (people's food choices) to something enjoyable (almost anything else). This is sensible career advice even for people who have \"normal lunches\" with coworkers.\n\nOP doesn't have to listen to any random stranger on the internet, but OP almost certainly has to continue working with this person. It might be fun to have the internet agree that your colleague's behaviour is ridiculous (and it is!) but OP still has to work with them. So trying to play this off as just a bad day might make tomorrow more comfortable. Again, reasonable career advice to anyone.", "NTA, but you should have apologised, knowing that your words hurt her feelings. Even if it\u2019s true. Remember, your action resulted in this situation. And.. \u201cit\u2019s no longer for me\u201d.. do you sense narcissism here ?", "Carly is being defensive because... well, I think you can guess. NTA.", "NTA. She has made her entire personality dieting. Now that you've advised her that it's dumb and irritating (I'm paraphrasing...) she no longer has anything to talk about and it's annoying the hell out of her."]}
