In the end, he still does this as far as I know and that is fine for him but it clearly was a point of contention between us that led to me feeling like he was disrespecting my feelings on the issue.

Is she depressed?", "This reminds me of when I got a mohawk in the 80's. My mother paused, sighed, and moved on. When I wanted to go somewhere with her her response was \"It's your right to do what you want, It's my right not to be seen with you\". Fair enough. nta.", "NTA, she of course can wear whatever she wants, she doesn't get to throw a fit when you enforce that boundary though.", "NTA - I would also not want to be out in public with someone in sleepwear. If it's soft comfortable clothes she's after, loungewear fits the bill while still being suitable for being outside. If it's cute patterns, you can buy leggings with similar cute designs, pair it with a long comfortable top or sweater, and still be in daytime clothes.", "NTA but why are you still with her?  Unless she has a mental health issue like depression, she seems to be too lazy to do the bare minimum to take care of herself.", "NTA", "NTA but it's really not appropriate for someone of any age to wear PJs to a nice restaurant, not even a college age kid. To the store or McDonald's sure but not to the movies or somewhere nice, and this applies for all ages and genders unless the person is a literal child", "Dump her. LOL No, seriously, dump her.", "People always say you should be yourself and don\u2019t worry about what anyone else thinks.

Which ofc makes sense cuz it\u2019s school. And ima say NTA. You have a preference, and voiced it. She\u2019s tryna invalidate it by saying you\u2019re trying to tell her what to wear. Also once I got out of school (class of 2022) I don\u2019t see girls even my age in Pj\u2019s out and about much any more. Maybe at the mall or grocery. But also not to the extent of your gf, where the bottom of the pants are dirty, and wearing actually house slippers. Typically it would be slides, crocs, or Ugg\u2019s in my experience. That\u2019s just iffy to me personally. But a restaurant!!?? Mall and store one thing but a restaurant is another. Too far tbh. Cuz even the girls I know that would wear PJ\u2019s or something close to that, at school. It wasn\u2019t ALL the time. And the ones that did always came off across as grungy( and not in the cool nirvana way) and like they didn\u2019t care about life or anything. And that\u2019s not even just because of the clothes but their charter. Constantly wearing PJs out don\u2019t exactly show people you\u2019re doing well.", "YTA and you should break up because you obviously care more about appearances than the actual person.

She\u2019ll neglect you, your responsibilities, and any children if you have those too.\n\nI'm not sure I'd jump straight to child neglect but you do point out something that the OP absolutely should consider. His standards for public behavior (which  appearance is part of) are very different from Lady Loungewear's. That sort of stuff does start arguments over how the kids should be raised and what sort of life skills the parents prioritize.\n\nI'd be curious to know if Lady Loungewear comes from a different background than he does, or one where her adult caregivers never modeled socially appropriate dress/behavior in a lot of different contexts. She might be defaulting to pajamas because opting out on her own terms is less exhausting than trying and getting it wrong.\n\nWe need more INFO.", "Nope, seen plenty of chavvy Brits doing the same in Manchester\n\nNip across road on a Sunday morning to get the paper? Ok no worries.\nGoing to a restaurant? No, get some self respect!", "I feel like there could be a compromise here. Like, maybe keep the fluffy cat pajamas and fuzzy slippers for home pj's, and find something less sleepwear but still comfy.", "Crop top, sweats, and converse isn\u2019t even the same as. Literal PJ pants( as Op said, like a sleepwear set) and house slippers. All you did was describe causal streetwear, that\u2019s also comfy.

They've been dating for less than a year. Maybe she always wears warm fuzzy PJs in the winter.", "INFO: is she wearing them out in public and also wearing them to bed at night? Either way, you are NTA, but wearing your outside clothes to bed is gross. \n\nI had an ex who started wearing really ridiculous outfits after dressing well for a while. There were a few factors leading to them wearing the equivalent of kitty jammies in public, but a big one was knowing it bothered me. I really should have recognized it was over then.", "Solid point, though OP also mentions that she does this everywhere but work. She's capable of discerning appropriate wear and doing so for that, just not with him.", "NTA, my fianc\u00e9 and I had to have the same conversation as things opened up after covid as I was just so used to wearing some of my ratty old house clothes and didn\u2019t feel like dressing up anymore. We had a gentle conversation where he mentioned that although he loved that my style was (in my own words) \u2018homeless chic\u2019 there were some things that shouldn\u2019t leave the house and I realised how much I had let myself go in regards to that. You were respectful & did the right thing, but if she\u2019s fighting you this hard then I don\u2019t think it will end well.", "NTA. NTA. Can people go back to wearing outside clothes outside.", "YTA. Sounds like there is a much bigger issue than what she is wearing, it sounds like she's slipped in to depression and needs help. If you want to lose your partner over this,  continue addressing her clothes not her health.", "NTA. IMO she should be screened for depression.", "NAH\n\nYou're uncomfortable with her mode of dress. You told her such and that you don't want to go to restaurants, etc if she's in PJs. She's fully entitled to do so, and you're fully entitled to set your boundaries.", "INFO: Did you ask her why the sudden wardrobe change?\n\nI'm in my 50's and retired. The only time I have worn pajamas in public in my memory was when I slipped and fell on the ice last year, landed on a 4x4 and broke a rib. (Feels kind of like setting off a bunch of snap'n'pops all at once. Blech.)\n\nI had been throwing out hay for my ponies first thing, with coffee brewing inside. Instead, I drove myself to the ER and went in, Eeyore pajamas and all. \n\nI don't fault her for wearing pj's, I know I flat refuse to wear uncomfortable stuff anymore. But I also don't fault you for being embarrassed. I kind of fault you for the way you 'sat her down' and fussed at her for it like she was 7. Did you ask her why the sudden wardrobe switch? I have chronic pain that is more severe some days than others. On bad days it hurts to wear clothes, tbh. And I also don't tell people about it. \n\nFrom the way you describe how you feel about it, I can't imagine you'd be satisfied if she switched to sweats. You have only been dating for seven months. If you are already trying to make her change for you, then just split up and try again.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nShe can find herself a diff guy who will be chill with her wearing PJs everywhere. But I bet that guy will be lax in many other ways that will not be to her liking.", "Definitely NTA, I am honestly horrified by what women count as acceptable clothing for going out of the house these days. \n\nLike you said, she's not just running to the corner store, or grabbing the mail, but wearing this out all the time. Yuck. \n\nI realize that my own sentiment is irrelevant, but I was raised that sweats are NEVER worn outside the house. \n\nSure hoody's have taken over the world, I can handle that, but dressing in pj's bottoms or sweatpants bottoms and sloppy tops is just gross to me, it shows you have no concern for yourself, how you present yourself to the world, how you carry yourself etc. It's just plain lazy, and yes I 100% judge people based on what they look like when they go out. \n\nI'm not saying everyone has to get all dolled up for anything, fuck at least throw on yoga pants, a bra, a decent top. Same goes for men. \n\nEveryone, employers, staff etc everywhere will treat you differently based on how you present yourself, won't take you or your opinion seriously on anything  and generally make commentary about going out with your partner looking like a hobo. \n\nNoone has to like what I say on the matter, but its a fact. \n\nI agree, she can dress however the hell she wants, and you can choose whether or not to be seen in public, as a partner to, someone who presents as lazy, slovenly, unkempt and unhygienic. Because that's exactly what they think.", "NTA dressing for comfort is all well and good but going everywhere in pajamas is going to far. I don\u2019t know why it seems to be becoming a thing.", "NTA I love my pj's but I wouldn't go to a resteraunt in them", "If it\u2019s a comfort issue, there are plenty of pants like yoga pants, jeggings, etc. that are a great option opposed to pj bottoms. I think you may be the AH for judging her choice without knowing the full reason behind her choice. I have weird sensory issues where certain materials touching my arms and legs, no matter what I can always feel the material rubbing along my skin. So I opt for very soft and non restricting yoga pants or very stretchy jeans/jeggings (Jean-leggings) because I\u2019ve learned that they don\u2019t bother me as much as denim or linen. \n\nYou should talk to her and find out why she prefers these, and if there is a bigger issue at hand. This way you can help her through it and find a real solution, rather than making her feel poorly about herself for choosing a specific attire.", "I\u2019ve worn pjs to the movies w my mom, because it\u2019s literally in the dark for an hour and a half, what I wear doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve also worn them to the grocery store, because again I\u2019m not there to impress anyone. However, I do wear normal jeans and a shirt or the like if I\u2019m going out to dinner or going on an actual outing. I would wear my pjs everywhere if I could, as I don\u2019t care what people think about me, however, I find it extremely inappropriate to wear pjs out to a restaurant or some other outing.

Don't be surprised when people don't want to date you.", "Either way, it's considered a lazy look. I wear my pj pants sometimes. If she wants to wear her fuzzy slippers, who cares? Does it effect you at all or disturb your day in any way? Absolutely not. Who cares. OP doesn't like that  that's also fine. Save her the trouble and leave her alone.", "Honestly I'm not a fan of seeing people in pijama pants when I'm shopping for food.

Just not in the mood to think about food or touch anything.\n\nAnd before someone accuses me of that: I'm not calling to exclude people from grocery shopping.
