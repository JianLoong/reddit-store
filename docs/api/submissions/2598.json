You\u2019re not asking her to wear makeup or anything fancy, you\u2019re asking to not wear pajamas outside. Adults should at least take care of their appearance and not look like slobs out in public. I wonder if she\u2019d be ok with you going to a nice restaurant in a grease-stained wife beater and cargo shorts?", "NTA\n\nShe can wear what she wants. You can opt not to go out in public with someone in their pjs.\n\nThis will end in a breakup.", "That\u2019s a compatibility issue, by the sounds of it. You aren\u2019t telling her what to wear, just telling her it makes you feel embarrassed . NTA.", "NTA for asking her if she could wear actual clothes (not pjs) in public. If she says no there is not much you can do. Your request is a reasonable one in a normal relationship. \n\nIs she depressed? Does she have body image issues? Perhaps this is a deeper issue if this is out of character for her. \n\nIf it\u2019s normal and she doesn\u2019t care what you think you\u2019ll have to decide if her wearing pjs is worth the relationship.", "NTA. As long as your polite and very patient about it. Maybe there\u2019s something else going on and this is just a symptom? Idk but I think this is a very reasonable expectation of one\u2019s partner.", "INFO: Have you actually asked her WHY she changed and started wearing this stuff everywhere?", "NTA ... You didn't tell her she can't go out in PJs, just that you aren't going out with her in public if she doesn't wear real clothes. If my husband insisted on wearing his pajamas further than the mailbox, I'm not going out with him either. We can order in. \n\nI agree with the others that if she is showing signs of depression, you should try and help her get any help she needs. In my darkest times of depression, I was a total slob in my appearance due to no energy or caring.", "NTA.  I hate when people wear pajamas and slippers out.  Grow up.", "INFO: are we talking sweatpants or hello kitty print flannels? Slippers that look like slides or uggs, or obvious isotoner house shoes?", "NAH.\n\nShe wants to dress like a scrub and you prefer a more polished appearance. She'll either take your opinion into consideration and dress like an adult for date nights or she'll loaf at home in her grubby PJ pants while she dribbles TV dinners down her shirt.\n\nSounds like you've hit the point in your relationship where the \"best behavior\" phase is over and this is just who she is. Nothing wrong with that but it may mean you aren't compatible.", "NTA but you should try it too.

Seriously though. Break up. If she\u2019s in her 30\u2019s and still hasn\u2019t learned how to get dressed in the morning, this is your indication that this is not the only thing she\u2019ll neglect in the future.

Have you tried to talk to her about her feelings or ask if something has happened? Things like depression or even energy draining medical issues (anemia, thyroid, etc) could be a root cause. Or even something terrible like sexual harassment or something can cause some people to want to hide in their sweats/pjs.", "NTA. It's one thing to wear that for a quick run out to the store but it's weird she wouldn't want to dress nicer during dates with you. I won't even wear sweat pants to the mall! I can't imagine wearing pajamas and slippers", "I\u2019d lean towards NAH, both of your feelings are valid but I\u2019d try to talk to her in a non-confrontational way about why she\u2019s changed the way she dresses, and why you want her to not wear pjs . \n\nFor reference\u2014I\u2019m 27 and also dress in sweats/pjs most of the time, mainly because of a combination of recovering from an eating disorder and not liking the way I\u2019m looked at when I\u2019m more \u201cput together\u201d. Maybe she\u2019s experiencing something similar but hasn\u2019t felt comfortable talking about it?", "INFO: How is her mental health doing?

That's really pushing it for even just a corner diner. \n\nThat said - is there a chance she's depressed or otherwise struggling with her mental health? Any physical health issues that may be playing a role?  A sudden change like what it sounds like you're describing is cause for concern and giving her ultimatums is not going to help.", "NTA.  No one is forcing her to wear or not wear anything.  You are simply withdrawing your own consent to an evening out or other voluntary date night activities if she wants to wear PJs.  The ball is in her court. That being said, you could offer a compromise of at least putting a little more effort sometimes say for a nicer restaurant but PJs are cool for movie night.  I get wanting to be comfortable but sometimes it feels pretty low effort when your SO just stops trying completely.", "INFO:\n\nDoes she seem at all depressed?", "YTA \n\nI fully sympathize with you, I wouldn't want to be seen with her in pj's either. I would have approached it with asking about why and I'd prefer if you didn't wear it. Because you can't tell her what to wear. If she wanted you to wear a yellow and purple g string around in public you would say no.\n\nIf her wardrobe choice is that much of an issue to you, move on from the relationship.", "YTA, as I sit here in my PJ bottoms I have worn all day.", "YTA since you are telling her what to wear, but if my partner worse pjs to a restaurant that would be embarrassing so I completely get you side of the argument.

Her choice but you as you said, you can choose not to be seen with her.", "Nta...ask her this: if you two had kids and school rules mandate that when parents pick up their kids from school no pjs, bonnets slippers or other 'sleep wear' attire is to be worn into the school, what would she do?(and where i live yes they actually had to have this posted at school entrance for parents) lol", "NTA Ironically this was my mom's same policy for us growing up when it came to our hair and clothes. I would also choose to not be seen with someone wearing PJs our to eat and such like that.", "Nope NTA. That's a very reasonable line in the sand. It's one thing if the pjs don't LOOK like pjs. I have some that could pass as every day wear. But clouds and cats and house slippers? That's a bit much for going everywhere. She can wear whatever she wants. Doesn't mean you have to be seen with her.", "This must be an American thing because wtf did I just read\u2026", "NTA. You're being reasonable. I understand she's comfortable but it's not appropriate for everywhere. Suggest leggings or the soft Bohemian type pants. Especially for a date, you aren't asking her to put on a tight dress, just to wear regular pants. I'd stop going to nice places. The store in the morning or gas station is one thing but you don't have to be comfortable going out with her then, just will probably be a rising problem with every denial of going out together if there's no compromise.", "NTA. I\u2019ll admit when I\u2019m lounging around the house all day, I usually look like shit. I might even make a run to Walmart looking like I just got out of bed sometimes. However if I\u2019m going out literally anywhere else, and especially with my boyfriend, I make sure I always look presentable, if not good as fuck lol. & For the record I\u2019ve never went out in public with actual pjs on, I agree that\u2019s embarrassing.", "NTA. I agree with the others who have said she sounds depressed.", "NTA\u2026 but she\u2019s prob not the girl for you. And that\u2019s totally fine. She\u2019s right, she can wear whatever she wants. You are right, you want someone who at least a gets dressed for the day. Which like me too, that would be a huge turn off for me. Even if they weren\u2019t the night set style you described, wearing sweats and a tshirt everywhere is not for me. But we can\u2019t change others! So best to be like hey this is something I want and need in my partner, cool if that\u2019s not for you but we both deserve our match! :)", "NTA. This is a reasonable boundary.", "NTA.\n\nShe needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nIf you wore a$$less chaps and lacy bra to a restaurant, she would have every right to say she doesn\u2019t want to go. You are not saying she has to wear something specific but what you describe is not really okay for even college kids to wear to a restaurant. They might do it\u2026 but is doesn\u2019t mean it is okay.", "NTA Of course she can wear what she wants. I have done it myself but only to Walmart, because it is Walmart\ud83d\ude02 but my daughter will not walk with me\ud83d\ude02 But it is your absolute right to not be seen with her. Her forcing you to accompany her is the same as you policing her clothes you are both adults and as such get to make the adult choices on clothes and the people you are with. If she wants to dress that way and go to movies and such she can. Just like you can refuse to go. Why is her choices more important than yours? Or her rights supposed to come at the cost of yours.", "YTA \n\nYou're giving her an ultimatum without ever talking to her, you can bring up your point and talk about it like a grown up. Pitching a fit and forcing her into choosing you over her comfort is not behaviour representative of a man in his mid 30s", "YTA. You haven't yet asked her if she's depressed, or anxious, or too tired. If you were going somewhere nice, like with a dress code, it would be more reasonable to say \"hey, where we're going tonight there's a dress code so you need to look nice, \"I'll be wearing dress pants, a tie, and a sports coat.\" For wherever you go to eat with the kids though, it isn't that important, especially if you haven't said jack about any of the three items mentioned in the first sentence.", "But also, maybe she is depressed? Based off you saying this is a recent problem, something has changed to make her not care about her appearance.", "NAH You are both setting boundaries and facing the consequences of said boundaries. \n\nYou are completely right to decide that you will not go out with her when she\u2019s in pajamas. She\u2019s completely within her rights to decide she wants to wear pajamas all the time anyways. \n\nThe natural consequence of those boundaries is that you and your girlfriend no longer spend any time together outside of your apartments. Only the two of you can decide if that\u2019s a relationship worth continuing but neither of you are assholes for  these boundaries.", "NAH\n\nI have an ex that would do this all the time and it would drive me up the wall. I was with him for 8 years and the whole time it would be pajamas to go out to dinner or a bar in the evening or the same ratty sweatshirt that was stained with hoels in it. In the end, he still does this as far as I know and that is fine for him but it clearly was a point of contention between us that led to me feeling like he was disrespecting my feelings on the issue. There is nothing necessarily wrong with her wanting to be in pajamas all the time just like there is nothing wrong with you not wanting to be seen with a significant other who is in pajamas in unreasonable settings. This probably won't work out between you two and if I were you I would cut my losses.", "She said it\u2019s comfortable.", "Could be depressed", "Literal PJs that comes as a sleepwear set and fuzzy house slippers.", "Even though I disagree, I like your train of thought lol.", "She makes good money and has a nice wardrobe. She used to dress nice. It\u2019s only been the last couple of months.", "~~N T A~~.  It almost sounds like this is who she really is, and has just been \"on her best behavior\" clothing wise up until this point.  I sympathize with you.  My most recent ex was this way.  He wore gym shorts and sweat pants EVERYWHERE.  I hated it.  Like, if your grocery shopping or getting gas, wear what you want, I don't care.  And I'm not saying he needed to wear a suit or anything, but if we're going out to dinner, at least put on a pair of jeans or something.  This may end up just being a compatibility issue between you two.\n\nEdit to NAH.  She's not an AH for wearing what makes her comfortable either.", "Then NTA. That's embarrassing. That's iffy even for walmart, definitely out of bounds for a restaurant.\n\nDoes she have depression or something? Sounds like she has something deeper going on.", "Yeah, totally unacceptable and this has become habitual?  The way you phrased it to her was entirely appropriate.  She is legally allowed I guess to wear that to restaurants, but you are most firmly in your right to not want to go them with her if she does\u2026.", "Have you asked her if she\u2019s feeling ok? That\u2019s a pretty big sign of depression, or maybe she\u2019s not feeling well, has had some body changes. \n\nShe might need to see a doctor.", "Has she gained weight?", "Ok, so why the change? There must be a reason. I know in the uk of people did this they would need thick skin to not feel embarrassed, or Chavy.", "I wouldn\u2019t wear pajamas to a restaurant but I have no problem wearing flannel pajama pants when grocery shopping on Saturday. \n\nSaturday is a day to wear pajamas all day if I have nothing particular to do.", "As a houseful of atheists, when people ask if we\u2019d like to try their church I always say that we\u2019re happy with our current church. That being the Church of No Pants. On Sunday, we keep our PJs on.", " I usually go to the gym on Sunday, so Sunday is leggings all day instead of flannel pants.", "My kids wear gym shorts for PJs in the summer.
