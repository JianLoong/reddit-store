In the end, he still does this as far as I know and that is fine for him but it clearly was a point of contention between us that led to me feeling like he was disrespecting my feelings on the issue.

Something's off here.", "I used to be OK with pj pants in public... when I was a teenager. As I entered the adult world I realized that a) it was a trend that was passing and b) that I should have some self pride when leaving my home/ comfy spaces.", "NTA - Sounds like you set a boundary. Totally fair.", "agreed!", "Yeah, OP isn\u2019t the AH but may be missing a bigger issue here.  He may want to approach this less from the \u201cdon\u2019t wear pjs\u201d frame of mind and more \u201cwhy do you feel the need to wear them\u201d. Might yield better results.", "Oh I see, so somebody should have carte-blanche to make absolutely no effort after they\u2019ve snagged a partner?", "This is kinda hard as someone with chronic pain tho not specifically op but for some of us some days it\u2019s harder to get dressed than others so If I can avoid changing or finding one thing Ie pants I\u2019m gonna shop in pjs idk how it effects the sake of humanity to wear real pants \ud83d\udc80 but I do understand the mental health part I agree op might need to seek help", "Really?! IT'S A PAIR OF PANTS. \nThis is worse than YouTube comments.", "Maybe we should be looking into why she suddenly has given up, not just treat symptoms.", "This makes me worried that she may be struggling mentally. I know I struggle with changing my clothes when I get really down. NTA but I hope that she's doing okay.", "That\u2019s really an american thing, where I live it\u2019s really disrespectful to go out with your pj\u2019s", "That sucks. Fortunately I have small boobs so I almost don't wear it and it's the most wonderful sensation ever.", "Sports bras. I will never go back to the normal boobie prisons. Sportsboob all the way. Bit of support, some coverage but comfy as hell. Go for the yoga ones so you aren\u2019t strapped down just some comfy support.\n\nEdit to add: DD/DDD cup so a smidge of control over them is needed for me", "I'm on the smaller side (B), so it might not be an option for you, but I switched to undershirts that have like, cup things in them instead of brassieres.  So much more comfortable.", "Pictures or it didn\u2019t happen! \ud83d\udc3f", "just get the squirrel head. this reminds me of the squirrel feeders that its a horse head an the squirrel has to put his head inside it to eat the food. so you see a squirrel with a horse head on its body.", "I was thinking about wanting one just to see what my squirrels would do if I wore one.", "I am so glad you have never struggled in a way that has made putting on \"real\" pants difficult.\n\nBut there are plenty of people who have and it can be a real struggle for some.", "I think this is the answer, and it just comes down to an issue of compatibility. I wouldn't want to fuck someone who wore pajamas everywhere either. Grabbing the paper? Fine. Walking the dog around the block in the early hours? Have at it. \n\nBut if you go into establishments dressed for bed, people will think you don't take yourself seriously, and neither should they. What you wear sends signals. Pajamas scream: immaturity, depression, sloppiness, laziness, \"I don't take care of myself\", etc... that's just the way it is.", "I'm in the habit of not wearing one if I am making a quick trip to the store or something, but it just feels awkward not wearing one at the office in a professional setting. Doesn't help that the office is extremely cold. \ud83e\udd76", "That is a great idea! Why didn't I think of that?!", ">What's immature about wearing what your comfortable in?\n\nThe fact you have to be obtuse and frame it like this proves you're not interested in having an actual discussion, you just want a soapbox to stand on.\n\n> Isn't it immature to complain about what other people are wearing, like it affects you in an way?\n\nThe only complaining I see being done is you whining about other people thinking wearing PJs in public to be immature. Sharing an opinion isn't complaining about what someone is wearing.", " Soapbox to stand on. Lol youre cute. I'm not whining at all. I'm genuinely curious as to why this affects people so much. Seriously. I've never seen anyone publicly call someone out on what they're wearing because it's \"immature\". Like I get a 12 year old wearing a thong and a bra in public is obviously too much for her age but when does it become immature to wear anything your comfortable in that's completely harmless.", "Immaturity is the behavior appropriate to someone younger. Maturity has nothing to do with clothing. Maturity is how someone behaves. Not dresses.", ">Soapbox to stand on. Lol youre cute.\n\nYet you proceed to soapbox in not one, but two separate replies to me lmfao.", "You clearly don't know what soapbox to stand on means. I'm literally asking why it affects people so much and you can't even give me a reply. You've clearly been had and don't know how to reply. The definition of immaturity is behavior that is appropriate to someone younger. It's very fitting of you.", "NTA. She can wear what she wants. You can choose not to want to be seen with someone in fluffy pj bottoms at a restaurant.\n\nAnd this comes from someone who dresses professionally for work - so on weekends i wear a t shirt, leggings, and thongs (im australian for anyone who gets confused). I would still not wear fluffy pjs to a restaurant.", "NTA. As you said, she has the right to wear what she wants but you have the right to choose to be seen with her. On another note, is she perhaps depressed, or feeling insecure? You may want to ask and reinforce how beautiful she is to you, no matter what she wears.", "NTA I believe its apart of the relationship to try and impress and dress your best for your SO on dates and public events.", "NTA By not going with her, you are controlling your own behaviour, not hers. She is still free to wear PJ's alone. She can still go to the mall and the restaurant. You are not effecting her rights to slippers.", "This was the first thing that came to my mind.", "They\u2019re slovenly and ugly. \nThere\u2019s two things.", "You pretty much just described me. I've been WFH since March 2020 and I spend every day in my pjs. But if I go out, even to go 2 minutes down the street to grab something from the corner store, I make myself put a bra on and \"real\" clothes. I'll sometimes throw a beanie on because I was too lazy to blow dry my hair (I have a pixie cut and sometimes if left to its own devices it gets a little crazy) but for my own sanity, I need to make a bit of an effort when I leave the house. I also have sensory issues and HATE wearing socks, so it's tough sometimes.", "I just spit out my coffee.........not kidding.", "He\u2019s free to dump her if he doesn\u2019t like it. What\u2019s weird is trying to control your partners\u2019 clothing choices.", "This. I wear dress pants at work, go home & change into yoga pants. I sometimes wear jeans if I'm going out for the day, but not most days.", "Don\u2019t let a few people\u2019s opinions sway you. I\u2019ve been a 34DDD before (breastfeeding two kids) and have gone down to a 32C (was a 32A prior to pregnancy) and although they now lack \u201cspunk\u201d I refuse to be uncomfortable anymore. I also have a medical condition so that anything constricting gives me bruises and rashes, so there\u2019s that, but I say we should be DONE with this nonsense that anyone needs to bind themselves up to be \u201cdecent.\u201d You have breasts. Whether you have them in a harness or just under your shirt, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s obvious they exist either way. If someone notices and thinks, \u201comg\u2014she\u2019s not wearing a bra!!\u201d who cares?? What\u2019s their point? That you have breasts? That they aren\u2019t perfectly positioned at some random standard of where they should align on your body? That they move when you move? I mean, how does having a second layer of elastic, fabric, padding, and sometimes even metal, between them and your shirt, change anything about the fact that they exist as part of your body, and create \u201cbumps\u201d on your chest?? Is it about the nipples?? Because no one cares that men aren\u2019t wearing anything between their nipples and their shirts! Ridiculous!\n\nI will defend the right to wear a bra, or NOT wear a bra, in all circumstances, with every fiber of my being.", "What you chose to wear, how you choose to present yourself consistently in this case, not a one-off, is behavior. Your clothing on one night is not, but if it is a part of a larger pattern, it is.", "I get that. Especially in her case, might be depressed but for some that's just a normal way of presenting themselves."]}
