I go out to get it, see it's his package.

A petty revengeful action from someone who claims to be an adult.  And, yes, the neighbor was an AH when they did it, but you should know better since it happened to you and you didn\u2019t like it.  Hope you feel like a \u201cbig man\u201d now.", "ESH.\n\nWell done, you've lowered yourself to his level for stupid pettiness.", "NTA\n\nGuess he didnt like the bitter taste of his own medicine. It wouldve taken him a few minutes of his day to be courteous, now he has to spend at least a few days waiting for his laptop again \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ESH and congratulations for further positioning your relationship with your neighbor.", "**YTA. And so is he.** Him for doing it to you, you for doing it to him.  This is the very definition of \"Everyone's Shitty Here\", except what you did: It was petty. You had the chance to be the bigger man, and you sunk down to his level.  Pretty sad, really. That's an asshole move.", "Soft YTA in the best possible way because I love petty revenge (you should post this to that sub btw) and 10/10 would\u2019ve done the exact same thing. \n\nMaybe from now on, get a PO Box or find another way to make sure he doesn\u2019t get your mail lol", "YTA.  Yeah, what he did last year was stupid and probably assholish. What you did was intentionally petty.  You could have been the bigger man.  Instead you decided to be a petty asshole.", "ESH \n\nI feel like being petty with neighbors is always a tactically bad decision because\u2026they\u2019re neighbors.\n\nHad you brought it to him, and said \u2018had I done what you did last year, this would be back at the shipping office\u2019 you would have made him feel like an asshole. Instead, you just made him angry *at you*, which is rich because he\u2019s a fucking hypocrite. \n\nBut did he deserve you being petty? Of course he did. But now you\u2019ve just started a war.", "NTA. Karma.", "Your neighbour acted like an asshole. Your frustration was warranted.\n\n...Then you did the same thing. Do you think there's gonna be some exculpatory maths in your favour here? You guys are bad neighbours. If I were you I'd be looking to mend the fence.", "NTA you\u2019re not an A for following the standard of behaviour that he set.", "Were you petty? Yes. Will this possibly start a fued? Yes. Are you the asshole? Yes, but only because you waited until late in the day to return to hub escalating from what he did to another degree but also he's an asshole too lmao", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But this is really more of a petty revenge story.", "YTA. It\u2019s an asshole move. The only difference is that because they did it to you, it could be considered a justifiable asshole move. Keyword: asshole.", "YTA. Ok, like for like, but why not start the Let's be nice battle instead? If you took it to him once, you never know next time he might take a package to you....

Why should he get his 2 hrs later?  I'm sure if I gave it to them by 2pm because it was an Overnight rush, they'd have figured out how to get it to him that day.\n\nNope, he started this ridiculous behavior.  What's fair is fair.  I'm sure it'll be there first thing tomorrow morning.", "Yeah, sometimes you need to play the chess of life, and OP miscalculated, and made a move where future with his neighbour only holds net loss or even net negatvive.

Those who do are pushovers and get walked all over.", "This is the best advice. Why lock oneself into a cycle of petty assholery over something so small. Be the bigger person and take steps to mitigate the fallout. Don\u2019t make your personal relations with a neighbour sour over this for no gain.", "I don't agree. But even then, this is a year later, not \"instant\". You've been stewing, wasting time on negativity, very sad. Assholes worry about being a pushover. Non-assholes think about how to make the world within reach of them a better place.\n\nYou're worse than your neighbour cos he isn't here on reddit seeking cover for his assholery. He's Billy Big Balls just assholing around with no excuses offered. Much more respectable.", "I\u2019m just picturing Billy Big Balls, all assholering around!", "Aren't we all. He walks bow-legged"]}
