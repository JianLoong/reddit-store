Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Absolutely NTA\n\nFirst of all, I'm as confounded as you. I come from a religious tradition (Judaism) where mourners (immediate family) aren't meant to do ANYTHING for the first 7 days after the funeral, including cooking for themselves, and the community generally rallies around to provide food not only immediately after the funeral but for those 7 days of mourning for the family while they focus on grieving.\n\nI can't imagine treating a wake/post-funeral gathering like a party where the deceased's grieving children are expected to act like \"hosts\" and provide food and drink for everyone else. Honestly, I get that different cultures have different traditions, but expecting someone who just lost a parent to cook for other people like they're \"guests\" or pay for them to drink at the bar just seems horrifying to me, even if you COULD afford it. Like, who expects that of someone who is grieving their parent? \"Hi, I'm here to reminisce about your recently deceased mum with you . . . mind buying me (and everyone else) a beer?\" Wut? Again, even if toasting the deceased is your tradition, they should be paying for you! \n\nBut the bottom line here is that *you are never responsible for paying for anything you didn't agree to*. I assume that your SIL arranged for the wake to be at your MIL's favourite bar. Unless you consented in advance to share the cost of an open bar, you are not responsible for it. She can pay, the money can, as another commenter suggested, be taken from your late MIL's estate (which is really the most appropriate thing), or you can offer to contribute a small amount that is within your budget. But you are ABSOLUTELY NOT responsible for the whole tab just because she decided that. I guarantee she didn't spend $1200 worth of time and money on the food.", "NTA. Was the MIL indigent? Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t funeral expenses be submitted to her \u201cestate\u201d for reimbursement?", "NTA. Absolutely not.", "INFO - The OP question is \"not *wanting* to pay\". How did that *not wanting* work out into action? Specifically did the bar get paid its money?", "NTA. \n\nI have been to more midwest funerals than I can count, and while many have had bar time the family of the deceased was never expected to pay. In fact, for all funerals I\u2019ve attended that moved to a bar people usually pay for the drinks of those closest to the deceased. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that SIL put the bar tab on you.", "NTA  all that should have been discussed before hand so it will give everybody involved the chance to look for budgets and places that can be afforded by everyone involved.", "She never wrote a Will. And died with minimal assets.", "I told my husband to stand up to his sister and make her pay at least half. But he didn\u2019t. He put the entire bill on our credit card.", ">INFO - The OP question is \"not wanting to pay\". How did that not wanting work out into action? Specifically did the bar get paid its money?\n\nSorry, but then it is too late. You just should have left then. Hope you will get something from the will to cover this costs. Best if there is money, show this bill as part of funeral costs - maybe you get it covered by her inheritance. But as I know the American healthcare she might be out of any money after such a battle", "Then honestly, your husband is the problem here. First, this is not necessarily a Midwest thing. Every family/religious group are going to have their own traditions. Since this is your husband\u2019s family though, he should have been aware in advance, or at least kept himself in the loop for his mother\u2019s arrangements. I mean, they had the wake in a bar. He should have discussed this with his sister beforehand.", "unless it is in your name, i would just leave.", "NTA.  \n\nYour SIL offered the open bar, she is responsible for paying for it. She has no right (legally or morally) to decide that someone else has to pay for something without prior discussion and agreement.\n\nI'd probably have your husband pay the $400 offered to be nice, but not a penny more.", "NTA- your husband is.\n\nHonestly expenses come up with funerals.\n\nAfter the $400 limit you suggested I'd say every birthday and Christmas gift for your husband is going to be paying off that debit.\n\nI hate to say it but I can't help but wonder if your sister and mother-in-law planned it", "NTA but it's concerning that your husband didn't work this out with his sister in advance. It's ideal for wake/funeral costs to be paid for from the deceased's estate, but not unusual for the family who's hosting the wake/funeral to contribute as needed. It's a little odd to me that your husband just turned up at his mother's wake without (apparently) having been involved in planning it: was all the planning left to your SIL? Because that might explain her otherwise very strange behavior.", "NTA\n\nSIL is the AH for not discussing it and making arrangement prior.  \n\nI am not familiar with having these types of events at a bar.   I hope the family is holding up ok.", "NTA", "I'm from the Midwest and have spent most of my life here. I've been to plenty of funerals and wakes, and at precisely none of them was there an open bar where the family of the deceased was covering the tab. This is literally the first time I've ever heard of this being a thing, to say nothing of your SIL springing it on you *at the wake* that you and your husband were covering the tab.\n\nNTA, and don't pay that tab. That's ridiculous.", "Oh dear god! I would have upped and left there and then. NTA.", "NTA. I'm from Wisconsin. This is *not* how our funerals go. It's absurd. You should not pay a bar tab for 75 people. Have you already paid it?", "NTA-  I just don\u2019t understand how you and husband has to pay.  Who talked to the establishment for the open bar?  Was there a contract and who signed it?  I would not be washing dishes and I would give them the $400 as I promised and would have left.  They cannot hold you responsible for someone else agreement.", "this is NOT a midwest thing. this is a THEM thing.", "Whoever opened the tab is responsible for it. It's time to perfect your Irish goodbye and sick the next person with the bill. Nta", "NTA, No way you should pay for that at all. I don't know any Midwest etiquette either but will confirm that growing up in Southern California, guests usually brought food and drinks to the wake.", "NTA. You neither arranged it nor agreed to pay", " NTA. That\u2019s absolute bullshit. NO ONE has the right to stick you with that bill. Contribute what you think is fair and reasonable, and stand your ground.", " Sister wanted to put on a big rich act order what you want drink and be merry I bet she didn't once tell anyone it was not her paying", "NTA.    You were generous at even being willing to pay $400.  Your SIL is an AH.  That tab thing should have been  discussed before anyone was invited.  I lived in Midwest my whole life and never heard of having a wake at a bar.", "NTA - that is not how it works.", "NTA.\nAnd this might have been SIL/MIL plan. To make you look bad at her wake", "INFO\n\nWas your husband involved in organizing the funeral and the wake? \n\nGenerally speaking, may there be reason for your SIL to be resentful towards your household in relation with the MIL situation? Were there medical bills or funeral expenses that you couldn't contribute towards and they fell on her?", "NTA, this is not a cultural practice of the Midwest... everyone would've paid for their own tab in this situatino.", "NTA. Not the way it works. My memorial service will be in an Irish pub, and the money for this has already been put aside. Also, apps to nibble on. I want a joyous celebration with no tears. \n\nThe food people bring to the house is comfort for the family. \n\nFor my bf's father (then Mom's) funeral, the \"committee\" at the church made tons of food for a reception in the church hall.  It was lovely.\n\nIn my family, we had a luncheon, which was paid for from my parents' estate.", "[removed]", "Same. I\u2019ve lived my entire life in the Midwest and anytime I was fed after a funeral it was paid for by the estate. For most funerals wine and beer are free, but where you\u2019re responsible for the cost if you choose to get hard liquor. But again that tab was paid for by the estate. And I\u2019ve been to plenty of funerals where there are afterwards drinks at the bar and various relatives buy a round to toast the deceased. But I have never heard of one sibling being asked to pay a fully open bar tab out of pocket, especially not having that sprung on them. Even in the more passive aggressive parts of the Midwest, that would be considered so incredibly tacky. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t pay it all. You didn\u2019t choose an open bar and you offered a $400 cap which is extremely generous in the face of SILs rudeness. Anything beyond that is on her.", "Exactly this.", "honey you got played... I'm from the Midwest too. You didn't have to do this. Funerals and wakes aren't one size fits all.", "Your SIL is an asshole and you and your husband are both spineless.\n\nWhen someone tries to run game on you the answer is a hard no, not a negotiation.

You were told of it when u got there and literally had no say. Your sister in law likely paid $200 for the food. Sounds she purposely put the biggest expense on ur shoulders.", "Absolutely. No one should have been obligated to pay a bill but the husband here should have been involved and asking questions the minute planning started.", "NTA. The traditions around who pays for/provides whatever are going to vary but *the worst* way to go about figuring that out played out at the wake when they sprung it on you after they organized it. Your SIL is TA.", "NTA, but you and your husband should have immediately informed the bar that you will not be paying for the open bar so they could start charging.  Then if she did not like it, she could pay the bar tab.", "NTA - You should've said no and that's that. Or agreed to the $400 and at that point the tab should've been closed. I'm in disbelief that a bar would even let you wash dishes to pay off a $1275 tab, so I'm thinking this post isn't truthful. Dishwashers don't make enough money in a month to pay off a $1275 tab.", "YTA for allowing your husband to cave in and pay the entire tab with a high interest credit card. You should have refused all together to begin with", "NTA. I disagree with open bars unless you have the money for it. This stuff should of been discussed up front and not at the time. The moment bar tab was mentioned I would if I firmed the bar that there was no tab and customer were to pay out of their own pocket.

She did that deliberately so you would struggle to refuse it.", "No reasonable person does something like that, particularly with someone in the financial situation of you and your husband.", "NTA, this isn't midwest culture, just AH culture.

As a Midwesterner, food trains and the like are common so the immediate family doesn\u2019t have to worry about regular meals for a bit, but it\u2019s very normal for the family or estate to host the meal/drinks at a wake. What is NOT normal or acceptable is telling someone as they enter a wake that you expect them to pay a tab you\u2019ve already opened. That is not the norm anywhere and is, frankly, bananas.

Did he pay for all of it himself, no, some people brought some with them. I know that my parents (who don't drink) gave him basically all the unopened bottles of alcohol they had from when they used to host more people but these days they rarely have guests.
