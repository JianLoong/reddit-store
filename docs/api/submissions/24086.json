Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Absolutely NTA\n\nFirst of all, I'm as confounded as you. I come from a religious tradition (Judaism) where mourners (immediate family) aren't meant to do ANYTHING for the first 7 days after the funeral, including cooking for themselves, and the community generally rallies around to provide food not only immediately after the funeral but for those 7 days of mourning for the family while they focus on grieving.\n\nI can't imagine treating a wake/post-funeral gathering like a party where the deceased's grieving children are expected to act like \"hosts\" and provide food and drink for everyone else. Honestly, I get that different cultures have different traditions, but expecting someone who just lost a parent to cook for other people like they're \"guests\" or pay for them to drink at the bar just seems horrifying to me, even if you COULD afford it. Like, who expects that of someone who is grieving their parent? \"Hi, I'm here to reminisce about your recently deceased mum with you . . . mind buying me (and everyone else) a beer?\" Wut? Again, even if toasting the deceased is your tradition, they should be paying for you! \n\nBut the bottom line here is that *you are never responsible for paying for anything you didn't agree to*. I assume that your SIL arranged for the wake to be at your MIL's favourite bar. Unless you consented in advance to share the cost of an open bar, you are not responsible for it. She can pay, the money can, as another commenter suggested, be taken from your late MIL's estate (which is really the most appropriate thing), or you can offer to contribute a small amount that is within your budget. But you are ABSOLUTELY NOT responsible for the whole tab just because she decided that. I guarantee she didn't spend $1200 worth of time and money on the food.", "NTA. Was the MIL indigent? Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t funeral expenses be submitted to her \u201cestate\u201d for reimbursement?", "NTA. Absolutely not.", "INFO - The OP question is \"not *wanting* to pay\". How did that *not wanting* work out into action? Specifically did the bar get paid its money?", "NTA. \n\nI have been to more midwest funerals than I can count, and while many have had bar time the family of the deceased was never expected to pay. In fact, for all funerals I\u2019ve attended that moved to a bar people usually pay for the drinks of those closest to the deceased. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that SIL put the bar tab on you.", "NTA  all that should have been discussed before hand so it will give everybody involved the chance to look for budgets and places that can be afforded by everyone involved.", "She never wrote a Will. And died with minimal assets.", "I told my husband to stand up to his sister and make her pay at least half. But he didn\u2019t. He put the entire bill on our credit card.", ">INFO - The OP question is \"not wanting to pay\". How did that not wanting work out into action? Specifically did the bar get paid its money?\n\nSorry, but then it is too late. You just should have left then. Hope you will get something from the will to cover this costs. Best if there is money, show this bill as part of funeral costs - maybe you get it covered by her inheritance. But as I know the American healthcare she might be out of any money after such a battle", "Then honestly, your husband is the problem here. First, this is not necessarily a Midwest thing. Every family/religious group are going to have their own traditions. Since this is your husband\u2019s family though, he should have been aware in advance, or at least kept himself in the loop for his mother\u2019s arrangements. I mean, they had the wake in a bar. He should have discussed this with his sister beforehand.", "unless it is in your name, i would just leave.", "NTA.  \n\nYour SIL offered the open bar, she is responsible for paying for it. She has no right (legally or morally) to decide that someone else has to pay for something without prior discussion and agreement.\n\nI'd probably have your husband pay the $400 offered to be nice, but not a penny more.", "NTA- your husband is.\n\nHonestly expenses come up with funerals.\n\nAfter the $400 limit you suggested I'd say every birthday and Christmas gift for your husband is going to be paying off that debit.\n\nI hate to say it but I can't help but wonder if your sister and mother-in-law planned it", "NTA but it's concerning that your husband didn't work this out with his sister in advance. It's ideal for wake/funeral costs to be paid for from the deceased's estate, but not unusual for the family who's hosting the wake/funeral to contribute as needed. It's a little odd to me that your husband just turned up at his mother's wake without (apparently) having been involved in planning it: was all the planning left to your SIL? Because that might explain her otherwise very strange behavior.", "NTA\n\nSIL is the AH for not discussing it and making arrangement prior.  \n\nI am not familiar with having these types of events at a bar.   I hope the family is holding up ok.", "NTA", "I'm from the Midwest and have spent most of my life here. I've been to plenty of funerals and wakes, and at precisely none of them was there an open bar where the family of the deceased was covering the tab. This is literally the first time I've ever heard of this being a thing, to say nothing of your SIL springing it on you *at the wake* that you and your husband were covering the tab.\n\nNTA, and don't pay that tab. That's ridiculous.", "Oh dear god! I would have upped and left there and then. NTA.", "NTA. I'm from Wisconsin. This is *not* how our funerals go. It's absurd. You should not pay a bar tab for 75 people. Have you already paid it?", "NTA-  I just don\u2019t understand how you and husband has to pay.  Who talked to the establishment for the open bar?  Was there a contract and who signed it?  I would not be washing dishes and I would give them the $400 as I promised and would have left.  They cannot hold you responsible for someone else agreement.", "this is NOT a midwest thing. this is a THEM thing.", "Whoever opened the tab is responsible for it. It's time to perfect your Irish goodbye and sick the next person with the bill. Nta", "NTA, No way you should pay for that at all.

You were generous at even being willing to pay $400.  Your SIL is an AH.  That tab thing should have been  discussed before anyone was invited.

To make you look bad at her wake", "INFO\n\nWas your husband involved in organizing the funeral and the wake? \n\nGenerally speaking, may there be reason for your SIL to be resentful towards your household in relation with the MIL situation? Were there medical bills or funeral expenses that you couldn't contribute towards and they fell on her?", "NTA, this is not a cultural practice of the Midwest... everyone would've paid for their own tab in this situatino.", "NTA. Not the way it works. My memorial service will be in an Irish pub, and the money for this has already been put aside. Also, apps to nibble on. I want a joyous celebration with no tears. \n\nThe food people bring to the house is comfort for the family. \n\nFor my bf's father (then Mom's) funeral, the \"committee\" at the church made tons of food for a reception in the church hall.  It was lovely.\n\nIn my family, we had a luncheon, which was paid for from my parents' estate.", "[removed]", "Same. I\u2019ve lived my entire life in the Midwest and anytime I was fed after a funeral it was paid for by the estate. For most funerals wine and beer are free, but where you\u2019re responsible for the cost if you choose to get hard liquor. But again that tab was paid for by the estate. And I\u2019ve been to plenty of funerals where there are afterwards drinks at the bar and various relatives buy a round to toast the deceased. But I have never heard of one sibling being asked to pay a fully open bar tab out of pocket, especially not having that sprung on them. Even in the more passive aggressive parts of the Midwest, that would be considered so incredibly tacky. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t pay it all. You didn\u2019t choose an open bar and you offered a $400 cap which is extremely generous in the face of SILs rudeness. Anything beyond that is on her.", "Exactly this.", "honey you got played...

Then if she did not like it, she could pay the bar tab.", "NTA - You should've said no and that's that. Or agreed to the $400 and at that point the tab should've been closed.

You should have refused all together to begin with", "NTA. I disagree with open bars unless you have the money for it. This stuff should of been discussed up front and not at the time.

As a Midwesterner, food trains and the like are common so the immediate family doesn\u2019t have to worry about regular meals for a bit, but it\u2019s very normal for the family or estate to host the meal/drinks at a wake.

Otherwise SIL is a real AH for forcing this on you during your grief.", "Nta they are ridiculous.do not pay it", "I have never heard of the family feeding the people coming to the funeral.  In Texas, the friends all bring food, and the church ladies, and the family is comforted by them while grieving. Just wow!!\n\nNTA", "NTA, never heard of this tradition of running a 1200 dollar tab for the grieving family to pay for. Insane.", "Nta this is not your responsibility. I've had so much death in my family and I've never heard of this being a thing. I'm also midwest. You never saddle the family with more costs as funerals already cost so much. Other people should have been providing the meals, not the close family. This was handled horribly (and not by you). I'm so sorry.", "NTA and how were they going to enforce this on you?\n\nUnless you had a card on tab behind the bar, they have absolutely no way to force you to pay. You never agreed to this with the bar. I'd love to see them convince a judge to make you pay.", "NTA  Holy fuck. Learn to say no.", "Midwestern here, never had alcohol at a funeral and I am from Wisconsin.  But another charming midwestern tradition that your sister-in-law is probably not sharing with you, is that in Wisconsin, at least, it is the norm to give a gift of cash in the sympathy cards to help defer the funeral expenses.  When my husband passed, there was a couple of thousand in the cards.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: You did not invite, you did not agree, just leave like any other guest, and don't pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince YOU think 400$ is reasonable, tell your SIL she will get that, but SHe will have to settle the bill, because you won't. Just don't do it. NOT YOUR DRAMA.", "I've never heard of this and if someone tried to spring it on me I'd feel highly disrespected and probably angry.\n\nNta.", "Nta and I hope you didn\u2019t pay. You had no contract and never agreed to it. Go back home and let them deal with it. They were clearly trying to take advantage of you so don\u2019t let them.", "what the HELL no way prearrangement maybe but she wanted it shes paying for it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nUnless you signed something, you're not responsible for the bill.  SIL overstepped.", "NTA. Pay your own tab and leave without a word.", "In Scotland the family pays for a meal for those who attend the funeral, but there's no way that one relative decides who's paying what. The cost normally comes out of the deceased person's estate. If that's not possible, the family has a conversation about who's paying for things - it's supposed to be divided equally.   \n\n\nAn open bar is unusual. At the funeral for each of my parents, I only paid for a drink on arrival for the toast. To be more precise, Dad's came out of his estate. I was Mum's only heir, so it was all paid out of what was left to me.  \n\n\nIt would have been the same at my husband's funeral if we'd been allowed to gather. (It was during lockdown.)   \n\n\nIt is disgraceful that your SIL has tried to put you in this position. I would refuse to pay. NTA", "NTA at all, don\u2019t pay it", "NTA\nI used to work in the function department at a local club in Australia and worked quite a number of wakes, a majority of the time when guest found out that the family had set up a bar tab they would insist on paying \u2018x\u2019 amount towards it, it wasn\u2019t very often that the family were out of pocket because their guests, between them, paid most if not all the tab. I always found it sweet that the friends of the family recognised that they are going through something really tough, have paid for venue and food, so they chip in so that the family don\u2019t have to pay for everyone\u2019s alcohol as well.", "Correct. NOT a Midwest thing. You know what IS a Midwest thing? Putting money in the sympathy cards you give the family at the funeral/memorial service to help pay for the funeral expenses. So I have to ask...where did those go?", "Are you saying that you wonder if the now deceased MIL schemed with her daughter before her passing to saddle her son with funeral debt? Cause that seems rather far fetched. More likely scenario is the SIL is trying to at least weasel her way out of splitting costs\u2026if not outright benefit from everything. Who is handling the estate and who benefits from helping themselves to funds or belongings of the deceased?", "[removed]", "I have never attended a wake at a bar. You are not an AH for avoiding this unexpected bill.", "You are not on the hook for any costs you didn't know of and agree to in advance, as part of the event planning.NAT", "You got played, you have a husband problem.", "Your SIL is an asshole for sure, but so is your husband, & so are you to yourself. He shouldn\u2019t have paid & you should have said something to him. You\u2019re not well off and you made things worse for yourselves. You both need to develop a spine.", "That was a dumb move.  Definitely YTA.  He should not have saddled your marriage with all that debt with out both of being in agreement", "It\u2019s kinda too late for this post then, the damage is already done", "Then your husband is a fool and should get zero fun budget until He pays that off.", "Your husband's a moron for doing that", "we had one at both of my parents' funerals, but I've never seen them anywhere else... we had parties to celebrate their lives"]}
