NTA clearly.", "NTA \n\nThat demand is ridiculous on so many levels. I'd be too mortified about losing a pet (which could have easily been a death sentence for the poor thing) to think about getting my money back for some fruit. And like many have pointed out, $50 on fruit is way too much. But also, if they lost the bird, did it even get a chance to eat that solid gold fruit? If not, were they going to hand it over after you paid them? Because if they just keep it then what would you owe them for?", "Be petty and ask for a receipt \ud83d\ude0a", "YTA for keeping a lorikeet as a pet.", "Thanks, I'd been imagining some kind of elaborate fruit salad to keep him entertained.

That price is ridiculous. As with most reimbursement situations, demand a receipt to prove it was that amount.", "NTA and no way I would pay", "NTA. First off, Apples are not that expensive. $50 bucks worth on top of the apples you had already provided. You said you were gone 2 weeks - 1 apple per day. Thats 14 apples. Even that wouldnt even come to 15.00 much less 50! Something isnt right here. Plus they also lost the bird, and whose to say they actually were caring for it??  I mean they managed to lose it. No way to prove if bird was actually even fed those apples in question.", "NTA. You don\u2019t lose the bird and ask for payment . That\u2019s incredibly insensitive. However if they hadn\u2019t lost the bird you certainly should cover the birds food bill. Apples are cheap but maybe they fed it other foods. \n\nHow do you lose a bird?

For them to ask you for cash at all when they had lost your pet was insane but to ask for $50?! What the heck were they feeding this bird (while they actually had it in their care of course) exotic fruit salads that they ordered specially from overseas?! Definitely NTA and I suggest you take a picture of a receipt from your next bag of apples (say 6 in a bag?) and then subtract the number that you left them in the first place and the number of days the bird was missing and then give them whatever the ACTUAL cost of an apple per day would have been along with the receipt as proof!", "You don\u2019t even owe him pet sitting money if he failed to do the one thing he was hired for- taking care of the bird!

If I'd have lost someone else's pet while in my care I'd never even dream of asking for reimbursement. Instead, I'd have paid for signs to hang around the neighborhood, checked local animal shelters and probably driven around the neighborhood for endless hours looking for it. Once while my wife and I were watching someone else's dog while they were on vacation I left a pack of sugar free gum out and the dog got to it. Sugar free gun contains Xylitol as a sweetener which is VERY poisonous for dogs. Long story short, we got the dog to the emergency vet in time and the dog was fine but we paid for all vet bills and didn't ask for a dime in reimbursement and declined our friends offer to pay us back for the vet. And guess what? He had us watch his dog again because he realized it was an honest mistake that couldve easily happened to him. This \"friend\" of yours should've realized that his mistake could have cost you your bird and been a bit more friend like. Also, $50 for a few weeks with of fruit for a lorikeet? That's a bit steep.
