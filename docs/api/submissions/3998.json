You left a sack of apples. That's what? 6 apples? 9 apples? About half to 3/4ths of the food required for your bird? What did they spend $50 on? Do they have an itemized receipt?\n\n\nI still find it ridiculous that they asked for money and let your bird escape. Glad your bird returned!", "NTA. mfer loses the bird and asks for a quick $50 to cover apples for 2 weeks? I don't even know what to say...", "NTA! I would feel SO terrible if I'd lost someone's pet when I was supposed to be looking after them. It would not even occur to me to ask for money. Your \"friend\" is ridiculous. And never ask them to look after your bird again!", "Are they golden apples? Apples from the Garden of Eden? Buy them a bag of apples and call it good. NTA (they've got guts to even think of asking after losing your pet.)", "NTA, when did apples cost $50?\n\nI think your friend/pet sitter was deflecting because you know, they literally lost your pet.\n\nBuy them a couple of apples out of spite (sorry, I\u2019m petty) and secure a better pet sitter in the future. Glad you got your baby back!", "I\u2019m just so happy to hear your bird came home.\n\nNTA. The audacity.", "NTA, I\u2019m in dog sitting and the dog runs away, I wouldn\u2019t expect to be compensated because I didn\u2019t do my job properly. Also how in the even loving god are the apples worth $50? I\u2019m in one the most expensive cities rn and 15 apples would cost me mayyybe \u00a310. If you really want to reimburse them (I don\u2019t think you should) tell them you want to see the receipt for when they bought the apples, if they don\u2019t have it\u2026 boohoo no money", "NTA.

Charge them $100 per day for emotional distress if they want to keep pushing for money.", "INFO: What happened to the rest of the fruit?\n\nDid they eat it, or do you still have it?", "NTA...

I'd be too mortified about losing a pet (which could have easily been a death sentence for the poor thing) to think about getting my money back for some fruit. And like many have pointed out, $50 on fruit is way too much. But also, if they lost the bird, did it even get a chance to eat that solid gold fruit?
