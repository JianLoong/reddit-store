She technically has a daughter from a previous relationship, but she signed her over to the father when she was born. She doesn't have legal rights or custody or anything like that. She started having the girl over within the last five years because she felt bad that the father is gone a lot and wanted to help her with life skills and be a parent. I've tried to be understanding, but this kid is 15 now, and fully understands the situation and just how much she can get away with. \n\nShe shows no respect for the house, and just uses us. Any attempt at a boundary or leads to her storming off to god knows where, and unlike with a child that she's actually a parent to, she can't stop her. She'll call my wife her mom and play pretend when she wants her to lie for her for something she wants, but will turn around the next day with \"you're not actually my mom, I can do whatever I want\". She vapes, does god knows what on her phone, and has given our address to tons of people we don't know to give her rides to and fro. I haven't wanted to put a stop to this because I feel bad for both my wife and her, but with a baby coming, this is quickly getting unstable \n\nOur child deserves a safe, stable home with a routine and expectations. We can't be a getaway or potential party house for a legal stranger that doesn't respect us in anyway. It's a huge liability, and we all deserve better. Her father doesn't care and isn't going to do anything. I've been trying to broach this conversation that this girl needs to either drastically change or stay away, and it's not going well. My wife is upset because she has so many regrets and thinks this is the only way she can do something by this girl. My mom thinks I should be making sure she stays away by any means necessary and that I'm downplaying how unsafe this is. We've been fighting all week about it.

It is hard and you are giving up.\n\nYour examples of how bad the daughter - **are weak.** So a 15 year old is on their phone a lot, do you have a reference of how much they do it, how much is too much...? Or, she vapes, other kids do that too. Or, her friends are picking her up, that is not unexpected either.\n\n*In lieu of asking if you are an asshole, you should do better than chase the kid away*. The kid matters to your wife, and should matter to your wife, regardless of her signing a paper away, mate.\n\nGo back to your wife and look for ways to arrange your life together better.\n\nIt does not matter if you are \"the\" asshole or not. Be better instead of finding that out.", "YTA for stating she \"technically\" has a daughter from a previous relationship. She DOES have a daughter. She may not have legal rights or custody but she does in fact have a daughter, no technically about it. \n\nYou are welcome to have boundaries in your home including no vaping the house. No parties. No drugs or alcohol.  The other two things, getting rides from people and having control over her own phone are not in itself odd for a teenager. I will tell you that in 28 years of parenting and many times where my teen or adult children grabbed a ride from someone we did not know, there has never been a danger. \n\nYou have a teen in your life. Cutting off said teen from her mother when her father isn't around much is going to harm both your wife and said child. Telling your wife that her older child has to \"stay away\" is likely going to end your marriage. And your mom's opinion means exactly nothing.", "You do realize your mom\u2019s opinion is irrelevant and you should not be discussing differences of opinion within your marriage with your mom?\n\nWe all need one or two safe friends to talk to about challenges with our spouses - but those friends need to be people who won\u2019t take sides and will help to see your wife\u2019s perspective as much as they will commiserate with you. Your mom is not that person.", "YTA. The worst of your stepdaughter's behavior is normal teenager stuff. You using inverted commas when you call her your wife's daughter is disgusting. Signing off custody to the father doesn't make your wife stop being a mother. That's not how it goes. She clearly regrets it anyway, and her daughter seems willing to give her half a chance. \n\nIf you're so adamant that the mother-daughter relationship shouldn't exist, why are you having a child with this woman? Do you think she's magically a different person than the one who abandoned her first child? And if yes, then how can you expect her to abandon her again?", "Lol wow. You\u2019re in for a rude awakening with what teenagers are like. You know that baby is going to grow up one day, right? You sound like a complete asshole even just listening to how you\u2019re describing a HUMAN BEING. Whether you like it or not, that\u2019s your wife\u2019s kid.", "ESH. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but this is your wife\u2019s bio kid still- and sounds like she wants her in her life. Have you talked to your wife about this?", "YTA The only thing that has to change is your behaviour. First, it sounds like you\u2019re hugely exaggerating any \u201cunsafety\u201d. Being on your phone and giving out the address to your friends is perfectly normal. Vaping unfortunately is too. The solution in case of any unwanted behaviour isn\u2019t to send her away but to step up your parenting skills. You\u2019re getting another child for god sake. Will you send them away too when they\u2019ll misbehave? Do better and get your mother to butt out. \n\nAlso, the legal situation is irrelevant as your wife IS a parental figure in her life. The most stable one as it seems.", "YTA - SHE HAS A DAUGHTER. why is your mommy's opinion worth more than your wife's.", "YTA. \"That girl\" is your step daughter! Your wife can't stop being her mother just because she's having another baby even if she doesn't have a legal right to her. You want her to abandon one child for another. Would you be saying the same thing if both children were yours biologically?\n\n\nETA: your mother has no business speaking to you about this! She doesn't get a say.", "ESH. Wife needs to set boundaries and you need to help and support. Yes the 15 year old has both you and your wife by the balls but you have some time to set clear boundaries and help your wife (and stepdaughter if possible ) with counseling before your family grows. If your wife gets nowhere, then establish LC/NC with stepdaughter, but keep in mind that your wife must do this with your support, not your demands. Best of luck.\n\nEdit, SD vs DIL. Yes I know the difference, but I put down the wrong one. Less of an issue to resolve compared to OP.", "YTA. You're right about wanting a safe space for your child and for setting boundaries for your stepdaughter. But, some of the things you said are just normal teenage behavior; I have 2 college age girls and when they were younger, they were on their phones all the time, got rides from friends before they had their own car, etc. That's normal.  So is pushing boundaries and your stepdaughter probably needs therapy too. She's not \"this girl\" she is your wife's daughter, and your stepdaughter. And your mom should have absolutely zero input, listening to her will make things worse. You need to accept that you have a stepdaughter, for life, if not you may wind up with no wife and no child in your life. Oh and putting daughter in quotes was a real jerk move too.", "I don't even have a proper judgment for this. Your wife gave up her daughter until she decided that she was \"ready\" to be a parent. That's pretty shit behaviour. I don't know why you'd want to have another kid with someone who abandoned her first one for half the kid's life. On that topic, do you not think maybe your stepdaughter might have issues from that? Of course, she does. Mom ditches her for ten years, then waltzes back in at her own convenience. That would fuck any kid up. Her daughter needs therapy, not to be abandoned again. \n\nFinal verdict: ESH. Your wife is using her daughter as a way to nullify her own regrets about abandoning her without considering her feelings. Her daughter is lashing out due to this. And you're trying to throw her away now that there's a new kid. You all need family therapy, and that poor girl needs some individual therapy.", "YTA. Seems you forgot that the girl is still HER KID. OP quit trying to sever a relationship between a mother and her daughter. \u201cThat girl\u201d is part of your family\u2019s life whether you like it or not. She is 15 that is the age of rebellion and self reflection everything you complained about or mentioned is literally just her being a \u201cmoody teen\u201d. You cant just try erase her from you and your wife\u2019s life, that\u2019s your wife\u2019s KID so get it into your head.", "Yta,\n\nThat isn't \"technically \" her daughter.  That is her flesh and blood.  She doesn't have custody, sure but that doesn't change much.  Your wife is trying to step up and be a parent.  It's a little late, but she is trying. It sounds like you have completely removed yourself from trying to  be a parent for her.  That old saying \"it takes a village\" still holds true.  \n\nYou don't have the legal authority to do much in the way of punishment, but you still have an opportunity to talk and at least try.  You aren't even doing that.  You see her as other, instead of seeing your wife's child\n\nFull on asshole", "YTA. Sounds like the kid has some trauma from *being abandoned by her mother* and having a dad who isn't really around. What stable adults does she have in her life? She's a literal child. \n\nYou don't give your or your wifes ages, so this is an assumption, but if she was a pregnant teenager, she may have felt forced to sign away rights, and is probably working through some of that trauma as well. \n\nYou need to switch gears here and start asking how you can *support* these two people. You and your wife are going to have a much better time if you stop asking if you're an AH on Reddit (you are, but you don't have to be) and start seeking parenting resources and therapy for everyone.", "TF you doing in AITA? Y\u2019all need to go to counseling together to sort this out.", "She abandoned her child and you are wondering why now she\u2019s a teenager she\u2019s having issues and now that she\u2019s trying to redeem herself you want her to abandon this girl again? Your child doesn\u2019t have more priority than this girl. YTA", "YTA. \u201cTechnically\u201d? She has a daughter. You have a stepdaughter, like it or not. Teens are tough, but your wife\u2019s doing the right thing by trying to be a positive part of her life and it\u2019s up to you as her husband to support her in any way you can. Better late than never and that applies to both of you. Tell your mom to butt out if she doesn\u2019t have anything positive to add to the already tense situation. Good luck!", "NTA for wanting to create a safe and stable environment for your baby. But you are TA for referring to your stepdaughter as \"legal stranger\". I feel so sorry for that girl.", "Yta", "You should get them into therapy, all of you really", "Her daughter deserved a safe stable home with routine and expectations too. And a loving mother who was a reliable person in her life. \n\nShe didn't get that, and her behaviour shows pretty clearly the damage that caused. \n\nYTA. She *is* her daughter. Not \"technically\".\nYou can't just erase her because it doesn't suit the shiny future you imagined for yourself and your wife. \n\nMust be really fucking difficult knowing you weren't good enough to keep, while mother plays happy families with someone new. Poor kid.", "YTA. It\u2019s a confusing situation for a 15 year old. Family counselling is needed for all involved. Your wife stated she has regrets. Now she can make up for the past but she needs to implement boundaries if she wants her daughter to be in her life in a healthy way. You guys can push through this difficult period but it\u2019s going to take teamwork, vulnerability and accountability. Has your wife had a heart to heart with your daughter? There\u2019s probably a lot of buried feelings and resentment. Time to open up wounds to let them heal. I wish you the best of luck with your stepdaughter.", "ESH\u2026.you and your wife, at least.

The girl sounds like she\u2019s behaving like an average teenager with parents who aren\u2019t together. She probably has some very complex feelings about your wife given their history.

It makes sense that you want a safe home for your family, so you'll need to talk to your wife....again.\n\nTell her what you see: she is letting her kid walk all over her and that's not the way to parent any kid.

For all you know this girl could be the one wiping your ass and your cheeks when you're too frail and withered to.
