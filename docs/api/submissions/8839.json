Whale meat and whale hunting is banned everywhere else for ecological reasons. Most people would have moral problems with eating that, so her reaction is completely understandable. \n\nYour girlfriend was asking you because she didn't understand the menu and probably doesn't know what half of the stuff is.

A lot of whale species aren't, it's not really the issue. It's a cultural thing, which you should have been well aware of. Most people consider whales to be too intelligent and valuable to consider eating them. Maybe that's hypocritical when we happily chow down on bacon or other \"intelligent\" animals, but it is what it is.\n\nI'm sure there's traditional food items you'd be repulsed by in some place in the world, and wouldn't enjoy having it sprung on you by surprise?", ">minke whale\n\nYou should probably edit the text to no that. Is she vegan or anything?", "Some species. Not all", "Just because something is cultural does it make it right", "NTA. Most people here are calling him the ahole for in general eating whale meat. That has nothing to do with this scenario. Surprise me.... If I know my English that means order me something you think I'll find tasty, but probably wouldn't choose myself. You did exactly as you were asked to do. Then she got upset. So unless she expressed discomfort about eating whale eat before you're in the clear.", "Its the culture of some countries to execute gay people, is that OK too then?", "replied to this point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qrpei/aita_for_feeding_my_girlfriend_whale_meat/j6rpnv2/)", "yeah and I stopped eating octopus when I found out about their intelligence, but I don\u2019t go around telling my family what to do - it\u2019s a staple in my home country.  I passed on the information and they can do with it as they please.  expecting people to always make rational & logically balanced decisions about their food is futile - people have different levels of emotional involvement when it comes to their diets, cultures, and relationships with animals. you\u2019ll never get everyone to see things the same way you do. just provide the basic facts and move on.", "Not sure you noticed but I don't eat animals or animal products, and I don't serve them either to other people, so no I wouldn't. \n\nBut if I see it happen, and people make a fuss about it, I'd point out the hypocrisy. People in the UK had a scandal with horsemeat being presented as beef, I used the same argument.", "He's the type of vegan even other vegans hate because it gives all of them a bad reputation.", "People hate vegans for the same reason they hate LGBTQ activists - for trying to create a fairer world with less suffering. People who want to bring positive change are usually hated. I have no problem with that.", "That's why i only spoke about the inhuman part. There is so much more we can talk about, as u said, I just don't want to start a debate.", "It's not even cultural. He makes it sound like Japanese people eat whale regularly when they most definitely do not.\n\nI've lived in Japan 5 years and counting, never saw anyone eat it on a regular basis ever.", "It is really different indeed. I had rabbit as a pet in my childhood and it died. Of course it was some kind of shock for a child, but it didn't stop me from eating rabbits from shop. Same with pigs. I saw how it was growing and alive and I saw how it was killed and participated in the butcher process. My FIL have some mental relation with pigs, he grows, so he can't kill them (he doesn't participate in slaughter process at all). This doesn't prevent him from eating pig meat after the process.\n\nAnimals may be intelligent and that is fine, as long as there is no mental relations with exact animal or animals don't start to talk, there is nothing bad to eat meat from them.", "Do whatever you think it\u2019s comfortable for you. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 if you eat fish, don\u2019t start discussion how intelligent has to be something to be considered not eatable. It\u2019s the same stupid discussion with people who are disgusted by eating dogs, but they\u2019ve never considered pigs or cows sociable and intelligent animals\u2026", "People don't live in black and white-- they are multidimensional, and despite what you believe they often categorize entities in different ways. I have a few vegan friends, and I commend you for it, but talking as if your blanket philosophy applies to others is nonfactual.  We already do know that quite a lot of people believe certain things, like that they would never eat a dog because they believe them to be pets, but they're fine eating pigs which have comparable intelligence, for example.\n\nMany people have reservations to eating whale that don't belong to cultures that routinely do. Talking about this situation as if that doesn't apply isn't grounded in reality.", "Horses have an anatomical structure that makes their slaughter cruel no matter how we've devised to do it. It either ruins the meat by making it inedible or causes extended pain for the animal.\n\nCattle can be taken down swiftly with very little pain that is not true with the horse.\n\nCruelty always has to be a factor when talking about something like this. And the more cruel thing is reasonable to deter.", "Read his comments below, tried to say veganism and homophobia are the same. Really terrible stuff.", "Did you seriously just compare yourself to a demographic of people who were persecuted and killed for being something they have no control over? Did I get that right? Were you born a vegan? Has being a vegan ever been illegal and punishable by death??", "Nah mate, I\u2019m both queer and a vegan, and you\u2019re being unbelievably obnoxious. Pipe down.", "Oh boy, is it the vegan schizo-posting hour already? What a treat.", "Do you REALLY think the reason people hate certain kinds of activists is because the activist want fairness and less suffering?", "literally everything causes suffering, dude.  vegetarians can\u2019t have the moral high ground because consuming dairy and eggs results in the slaughter of baby animals; vegans may try to avoid [animal products](https://thetreekisser.com/activism-2/the-impossible-burger-debate-was-a-test-for-vegans-and-we-failed/) as much as they can but it\u2019s literally [impossible](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medications-without-animal-ingredients-hard-for-doctors-to-source-1.2524533); even if you were able to photosynthesize, the phones and computers that we all use were made possible by human suffering.  we\u2019re all hypocrites living against our ideals in one way or another, just do the best you can and pick your battles.", "I'm bisexual myself and have been persecuted for it, I see I hit a nerve though ? Did you just assume I was straight ? \n\nBeing born an animal also gives a you a death sentence for the sake of food when there's so many other options. I see no difference in the suffering of animals than in the suffering of humans. \n\nActivists are hated all around the world, and the people who hate them usually have some inner guilt issues.", "Lol I know I'm being super obnoxious, I'll stop, sorry.", "It sure is, glad you could join !", "Nope, I just wanted to entertain an internet debate. People hate certain kind of activists for trying to push their ideas in the most patronising way possible, which is exactly what I've done.", "I never mentioned your sexuality, more the bizarre and nonsensical linking of sexuality and veganism. I don't care where you put your genitals, I care about you lowering the value of suffering millions of people people went through in an attempt to say that vegans are as hard done by as LGBTQIA+ folks. Pretty shameful behaviour and even worse if you're part of that group. You should have a moment of introspection and think about it.", "If you want to activate, then activate in facts. Cows and pigs are bred for food. Deer and some other animals are hunted to keep the population in control. If you don\u2019t agree that that\u2019s right, fine. But don\u2019t make up stupid shit to get your point across.", "I\u2019m gay and I agree with you. Everyone calling you out are just failing to see the point you\u2019re trying to make. They don\u2019t have the empathy necessary to see farmed animals as living, feeling beings worthy of dignity and respect, so any attempt to compare their suffering to human suffering cannot get through their wall of cognitive dissonance.", "That's not what I said, you said people hate vegans for their activism, same goes for every activist group, I just used LGBTQ as an example but could've  used any another example. I wasn't comparing the suffering, I was comparing the hate. No point having a debate with you if you're going to twist my words to try and justify your support of the murder of animals for the sake of your taste buds.", "Where have you been ? I've been fighting this battle on my own here \ud83d\ude05 but you're absolutely right, and at some point  it's just not worth the convo to try and convince some internet strangers."]}
