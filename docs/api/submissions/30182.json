Your son has 2 base chores (BC), your daughter has 2 BC. Your son dropped one base chores. Based on the agreed upon rules, it would be unfair to integrate that base chores into your daughter's BCs. So it was fair to treat it as an extra chore (EC) for her instead of a BC. Your son is wrong (and maybe unaware that actions have consequences, even if the consequences are pretty neutral (right now)). \n\nHowever, your son is 19, in a gap year, living under your roof rent free while he works, and he only has 2 BCs to perform in order to participate in the house. Yet he *chose* to drop 1 BC **that directly affects the well being of a living being** because his girlfriend's schedule changed. Instead of spending one hour less per day with her, he chose to be an inconvenience to the dog, to whoever had to clean bodily fluids and to your daughter (money's nice, but how do you justify to her that she has 2 BCs and her brother has 1 only and it's fine?). He can repeat all he wants that his gf's schedule is out of his control, but he decided that maximising his time with her was more important than  doing his part in the house. It is such a little request.\n\nIf I were you, I would have decided that the money your daughter is getting for performing that extra chore should be coming out of her brother's pockets.

Considering how much a professional dog walker would cost, letting him walk the dog in exchange for room and board was a good deal for everyone, but now he's not holding up his end of the bargain. Figure out what the market rate for a room in a shared house in your area would be, knock 10% off as a family discount, and draft up a lease agreement. Make it clear that he'll still be responsible for his share of cleaning communal spaces just like he would be in any other house share.\n\nProbably also worth a conversation where you revisit expectations for what him living at home look like now that he's an adult. If starting college next year is a precondition for living in your house, I'd make sure he's still on track for that plan.\n\nNTA btw", "he sounds like a shit parent for making his kids, one grown adult might i add, do chores? lmao.", "But what is this other chore that makes it okay for an adult with an income to live rent-free in your house and feel *he* is the wronged party for *you* spending extra money that was supposed to be 50% of his contribution to the household instead of paying his share? \n\nHow did you raise such an entitled AH? \n\nNTA for paying your daughter for extra work but there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ve contributed to his AH behaviour by not letting him suffer any consequences when he not only neglected an agreed-upon task, but neglected a living, breathing animal! Poor doggo suffered from needing to do their business so urgently they ended up doing it in the house. It\u2019s not like dogs enjoy that. \n\nYou were inconvenienced by having to clean up the mess, and now you\u2019re spending money on your son\u2018s convenience. Why do you think there\u2019s a chance *he* is right?", "the daughter doesn\u2019t want to trade her chores so why should he get one of hers?", "If you look strictly at the element that the daughter is being paid for the extra chore, yes that is \"fair\", because it meets the standard that had been set. (Two chores required. Anything more would be paid.) Does the son have reason to be upset there? No, he does not. In fact, if you look, nowhere have I said anything to dispute that.\n\nAt the same time, looking at the overall picture, I do question whether OP is actually being fair. Because their way of dealing with this is allowing the son to not live up to up that basic expectation of living as a member of the house of doing 2 chores.\n\nYes, the son is refusing to do a second one and making excuses. But OP is allowing them to do so.\n\nWhich is not fair. And probably not fair to anyone in the house because there are other chores that are needing doing, not just walking the dog, and someone is having to do something that he could be doing, but won't.", "I wrote out a huge thing then just deleted it. Your downvotes speak enough to the situation. \n\nIn terms of what OP is asking, no, OP is NTA."]}
