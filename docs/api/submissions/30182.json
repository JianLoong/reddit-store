One of his chores is taking the dog out between 1pm-3pm. But now he\u2019s out of the house most of the time at those hours so he started taking her (the dog) out earlier (like 11am-12am) and then that result in the dog not being able to make it till I get home to take her out in the evenings (she\u2019s still young, she can\u2019t hold it for a long time). \n\nAfter two weeks of having to clean up after she does it at home, we just told him to stop and that S will take care of it.\n\nS has been doing a lot of extra chores recently since she wants to buy some very expensive nails kit so I asked her to take the dog out when she comes back from school.\n\nYesterday I gave S all the money she made last month my son was there and saw that it was quite a lot so he teased her about wanting to return the favour to her boyfriend and buy him a big gift.\n\nS teased him back that she will tell her boyfriend to thank him since he helped her quite a lot of this (we pay her more than we should probably for walking the dog since she really likes going to her friends house right after school so having to go home is quite a bother for her).\n\nHe laughed and asked her how come.\n\nS just answered that walking the dog has helped a lot on saving up.\n\nHe stopped laughing and asked me quite angrily what S means by that.\n\nI just told him that since he can\u2019t take the dog out on the right time she gets money for doing an extra chore.\n\nHe got mad and told me that he thought I just added it to her basic chores and how can I pay her when I don\u2019t pay him for doing it.\n\nI told him that for S it\u2019s an extra chore that inconvenient her, it\u2019s not her fault that he can\u2019t do his part and that I won\u2019t make her change her all routine without giving her a little something in return.\n\nHe glared at me and stormed out, he texted us a hour later, a hour which we\u2019ve been worried in, we started driving the street after 15 minutes of him not coming back, that he was in his girlfriend house and that he\u2019s going to sleepover at hers.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been back since, and expect to text us that he\u2019s fine he won\u2019t talk to us.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I asked my daughter when she took on walking the dog if she wants to switch one with him, she said no since she gets good money for doing it, and we\u2019re looking for something else for him to do but he has been having excuses about why he can\u2019t do anything we suggest so in the mean time he\u2019s been having one base chore", "created_utc": 1698945610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m8mah/aita_for_paying_my_daughter_for_doing_my_son_chore/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's still a minor and she's getting extra money for household chores. I don't see this as unfair.", "NTA. Sounds like good parenting to me honestly. Adding extra work on the table is supposed to get you money, while not doing your job will make you lose it.", "> He glared at me and stormed out, he texted us a hour later, a hour which we\u2019ve been worried in, we started driving the street after 15 minutes of him not coming back\n\nthat's a bit of an overreaction, in my book\n\nfor the rest, you're almost 100% right. Your son has 2 base chores (BC), your daughter has 2 BC. Your son dropped one base chores. Based on the agreed upon rules, it would be unfair to integrate that base chores into your daughter's BCs. So it was fair to treat it as an extra chore (EC) for her instead of a BC. Your son is wrong (and maybe unaware that actions have consequences, even if the consequences are pretty neutral (right now)). \n\nHowever, your son is 19, in a gap year, living under your roof rent free while he works, and he only has 2 BCs to perform in order to participate in the house. Yet he *chose* to drop 1 BC **that directly affects the well being of a living being** because his girlfriend's schedule changed. Instead of spending one hour less per day with her, he chose to be an inconvenience to the dog, to whoever had to clean bodily fluids and to your daughter (money's nice, but how do you justify to her that she has 2 BCs and her brother has 1 only and it's fine?). He can repeat all he wants that his gf's schedule is out of his control, but he decided that maximising his time with her was more important than  doing his part in the house. It is such a little request.\n\nIf I were you, I would have decided that the money your daughter is getting for performing that extra chore should be coming out of her brother's pockets. There should be a penalty for not performing the (agreed upon) minimum.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA. If they had switched a chore then she wouldn't be paid, but since she added something to her list she should be paid more.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t change the rules, extra chores = extra money. Your son is just mad that his sister is better at managing her time and money. I also don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so upset about it when he has a job that makes him money. His sister ONLY has chore money when he could have both chore money and job money if he gave up a little bit of his \u201cgirlfriend time.\u201d", "lol NTA what kind of 19 yo ADULT is crying about not getting an allowance yikes", "NTA and your son is acting entitled. You shouldn't get paid for cleaning up after yourself and contributing to the household you live in. He chose to take a gap year but that doesn't mean he can do whatever he wants without consequence. He slacked off on a chore and you let him off the hook. Your daughter, who is still minor and still in school, took on *another* chore on top of what she already does so you paid her for it. He doesn't have a right to be upset about that.", "NTA for paying her. It makes perfect sense to me that she gets paid for doing an extra chore that is supposed to be his. However YTA for assigning him a chore that can only be completed by his being home between 1-3 pm every single day. It kinda sucks that he's never supposed to be gone during that time of the day just because of that one chore. You need to offer another chore instead with more flexibility. Especially if it's not his dog.", "Nta he can move out if he wants such ridiculous treatment", "NTA\n\nShe's going above and beyond so she's earning the money. When one of my kids does that they get extra chore money too. \n\nHe's throwing a tantrum by hiding out over there but that won't get him the money either. He's old enough to figure out how this works", "NTA for paying her, but waht is is he doing, did I miss that?", "NTA your son is very entitled. He should be paying your daughter to do his chore or you need a family meeting to reassign all the chores so he can do his on his own.", "It's not your son's business what you do with your money.  It's also wildly unfair that this adult man is trying to take money from an already overburdened child.

NTA for paying your underage daughter for doing your adult son's work.", "To all the people saying you should have changed his chore.
