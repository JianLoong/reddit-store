There is nothing wrong with validating disappointment, but the disrespect you are being shown for prioritizing your sick child, needs to be the starting point in your convo with your husband. Yes, you should do anything you can to accommodate your stepdaughter seeing her father, but this isn\u2019t and wasn\u2019t your fault.

She doesn\u2019t see them enough as it is.", "Let me reiterate: *the kid's father wasn't there.*  She wasn't going to get any (or much) time with him anyway.

He was coming back at some point that day. We don\u2019t know if this was just a one day visit or if she was sleeping over. OP didn\u2019t specify that. Going to your father\u2019s house isn\u2019t a change of scenery. It\u2019s spending time with your family. That\u2019s not a bad thing. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t be asking for random visits if she saw her dad more regularly. He spends every day with his youngest child but only sees his oldest less than ten days out of the month. Doesn\u2019t that sound a little imbalanced to you? Can you imagine the effect that would have on an 11 year old?", "As I said, the kid either wasn't going to get much time or any time with her dad.  Her mother couldn't bring her over which likely means she was otherwise occupied.  I wouldn't be surprised if the kid wasn't bored and that's why she wanted to come over to OP's.\n\nOne of the unfortunate parts of divorce is sometimes children don't get equal time with each of their parents.

However, based on the limited information provided, I don't think it bodes well she and her mother threw hissy fits, and she refused to come to over today because she didn't get her way yesterday.\n\nAgain, nothing is stopping the adults involved - and that includes OP - in coming up with a new visitation agreement if they think it's needed.", "One kid is sick and the other wants to come over to just hang?
