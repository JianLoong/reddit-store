Go to the post office and permanently forward your mail to your address. I have a five level mailing system to sort my mail daily because my adults children still receive mail at my house.

Is that the address you use even though you don't live there?\n\nMy mail used to go to my parents house when I was in my 20s.  They opened every single peice of it.

I never got mad about it I just figured if I was given the opportunity I would not do that.\n\nFlash forward, my daughter (35) gets mail to my house and as much as I want to open it some times, I feel its an invasion of privacy.

My mom had this habit as well until I got her to stop.  The way I got her to stop was I sent a copy of the law that says it's illegal to open someone else's mail to me and she opened it.  When she read the law, she freaked out and hasn't opened my mail since (it's been about 5 years).  I don't know if it was the 5 years in prison or the minimum $250,000 fine that got through to her.\n\nKeep plugging away, and hopefully a police department will hire you.

That\u2019s what\u2019s annoyed me with my background she should know better. She\u2019s just been blatantly nosey and the lying is just too far for me.

I was shocked, pissed off and tired and I just wanted to go home and think about it before I blew my top.

If told nor to open it and you did they are the AH.", "Yeah. The letters gone there because I did move back in with them for a very small period of time while I was applying for the job.

You do realize that she had already opened it before she even called you, right?  She is clearly one of those people who think that anything in their house is under her rules.
