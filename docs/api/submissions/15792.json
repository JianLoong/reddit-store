I\u2019m exhausted and on mobile \n\nMy (M32) Father (M68) is a \u201cold school\u201d parent. He was really pro-boy\u2019s don\u2019t show emotion and wouldn\u2019t let me cry when I was younger. I was never allowed to show affection to him either and one of the only times I remember hugging him was my high school graduation and when my son was born. \nAs a result, we\u2019re not close at all. The only reason i\u2019m still in contact with him is that I\u2019m close with my mother. She was always standing up for me when he\u2019d give me the don\u2019t cry bullshit. \nTonight, (technically yesterday) my mom invited my son (m13) and I over for dinner. I haven\u2019t visited with my mom in a while, so I decided just to go after I picked my son up from school. \nSomething had happened between my son and his best friend and he was upset. We talked it out on the way there and he was calmed down by the time we arrived. However, he got a text from his friend about an hour later, which was his friend dropping him. \nHe was on the verge of tears, so I took him into the den in the back of the house and talked to him about it. My Father walked back there was I was holding both of his hands and telling him to take dee breaths. He muttered something about how boys were stronger back then and he was being a \u201csissy\u201d. He started to talk about how \u201cthis generation is fucked\u201d and I immediately cut him off and told him to never tell me how to parent. He tried to tell me I was too soft and all 32 years of anger exploded into him. \nI told him he was a terrible excuse for a father and why I haven\u2019t cut him off. I then said I want nothing to do with him and to never talk to me or my child again, before leaving. I told my mom I loved her and still plan to remain in contact with her. \nOn the way home, he tried calling me multiple times, but I declined the call until he gave up. He\u2019s tried texting, but I just put his contact on do not disturb. \nI may have think I scared my son though, as he\u2019s been really quiet since. I\u2019ve never yelled in front of him like this before so I can see if I startled him. I also feel bad that my mom had to hear that, like my son, I\u2019ve never yelled like that in front of her before and just feel bad since it\u2019s her husband.

While you might have been an asshole for blowing up at him like that, it sounds like he's been an asshole for thirty years, and he had it coming.\n\nYou are absolutely right that your son is *your* son, and your father has absolutely no right to tell you how to parent.", "NTA- You are a good father despite how your father raised you. You are teaching your son how to be an emotionally healthy adult. Good job! As I have learned emotions are like colors there are more than the basic crayola 6 pack of crayon colors. There is a lot of them and they can be used together. People are allowed to feel how they feel, telling them they can\u2019t is WRONG. \n\nYou should apologize to your son for blowing up, and not controlling your emotions. And then I would suggest telling him a little bit about how you where treated growing up. Don\u2019t tell him traumatic stuff, but be honest. Same goes for your mom. My bet is she already knows that it is an issue between you and your dad. But didn\u2019t want to get involved, or doesn\u2019t see it as an issue.", "NTA\n\nYour father's attitudes are exactly why we see a proliferation of the Andrew Tate incel bunch, men who think they can't show any emotions otherwise they're losers who'll never get a woman or succeed in life. It is toxic. \n\nIt's a shame it came out in an outburst from you but you were defending your son and didn't want your father's toxic thinking to affect your son.", "NTA.\n\nGrandparents play vital roles, and among them is to let the next gen take the wheel.\n\nJust as the Baby Boomers must get out of the way in the workforce and politics, they must not play Mom and Dad when they are Grandparents.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s comments/opinions are really shitty and harmful and I think you were right to stand up to him. That said, make sure you talk with your son about what happened and process it with him. That\u2019s definitely a really upsetting thing for him to have witnessed \u2014 especially when he was right in the middle of going through his own personal stuff \u2014 and if there\u2019s going to be a separation from his grandfather, that will affect him too.\n\nGlad you are raising your son differently though. That\u2019s amazing. Breaking generational cycles isn\u2019t easy at all and you are doing it!", "NTA. He definitely did not need to make that comment, especially seeing as his grandson was distressed. I hope you've had the time to sit down with your son to explain what happened back there.", "NTA, your father never even cared about your emotions or feelings towards him, so how can he even expect for you to care about hin?", "NTA. That being said your son is going to blame himself bc that\u2019s what kids do. Sit down with your father and explain that not only are things different now but there are studies that prove that coping with feelings and emotions is not only healthier but it helps folks deal and \u201cbe strong\u201d. You understand that his outburst comes from love but it is outdated and you want your child to have a safe emotional space to even cry in if that is necessary. This can be salvaged and if it can\u2019t then you sit down with your child and explain why you lost your temper (totally justified, I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t) and make it clear you need him to know that A) grandpa loves them but comes from a toxic time and B) they are always allowed to feel their feelings with you. Good luck you sound like an awesome dad.", "Nta dad sounds well... ugh", "NTA. Your parenting is sensible and there's no hard and fast rule that guys can't be emotional or so, your dad is expecting the whole world to follow his parenting. However, speak to your son and see how he felt that day", "nope, NTA.", "NTA. Your father is borderline if not actually abusive, and he had zero rights to be interfering with your interactions with your son.\n\nTalk to your mother and your son, apologise for frightening them if necessary, and your father can go fish. Sooner or later something will have to get through to him. 68 isn\u2019t that old, and it\u2019s about time he learned a new way to behave.", "NTA - THIS is now how you end a cycle of family toxicity. Your son will never grow up feeling you didn\u2019t stick up for him.  And will hopefully do the same if he ever has children of his own in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would suggest though that you talk to your son. If you are vulnerable with him, are willing to apologize when you are wrong and admit fault, he will also do the same. Tell him the same things you wrote here and be sure to stress to him that you didn't cut his grandfather off because he pissed you off one time and you certainly aren't going to cut your son off for this reason. He may be scared ( as unreasonable as it is) that he caused the rift as well. So talk, communicate. It does wonders", "YTA. I'm sure you mean well, but this is not a good way to prepare your son for real life. Your father is right."]}
