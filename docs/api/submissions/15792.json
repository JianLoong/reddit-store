I\u2019m exhausted and on mobile \n\nMy (M32) Father (M68) is a \u201cold school\u201d parent. He was really pro-boy\u2019s don\u2019t show emotion and wouldn\u2019t let me cry when I was younger. I was never allowed to show affection to him either and one of the only times I remember hugging him was my high school graduation and when my son was born. \nAs a result, we\u2019re not close at all. The only reason i\u2019m still in contact with him is that I\u2019m close with my mother. She was always standing up for me when he\u2019d give me the don\u2019t cry bullshit. \nTonight, (technically yesterday) my mom invited my son (m13) and I over for dinner. I haven\u2019t visited with my mom in a while, so I decided just to go after I picked my son up from school. \nSomething had happened between my son and his best friend and he was upset. We talked it out on the way there and he was calmed down by the time we arrived. However, he got a text from his friend about an hour later, which was his friend dropping him. \nHe was on the verge of tears, so I took him into the den in the back of the house and talked to him about it. My Father walked back there was I was holding both of his hands and telling him to take dee breaths. He muttered something about how boys were stronger back then and he was being a \u201csissy\u201d. He started to talk about how \u201cthis generation is fucked\u201d and I immediately cut him off and told him to never tell me how to parent. He tried to tell me I was too soft and all 32 years of anger exploded into him. \nI told him he was a terrible excuse for a father and why I haven\u2019t cut him off. I then said I want nothing to do with him and to never talk to me or my child again, before leaving. I told my mom I loved her and still plan to remain in contact with her. \nOn the way home, he tried calling me multiple times, but I declined the call until he gave up. He\u2019s tried texting, but I just put his contact on do not disturb. \nI may have think I scared my son though, as he\u2019s been really quiet since. I\u2019ve never yelled in front of him like this before so I can see if I startled him. I also feel bad that my mom had to hear that, like my son, I\u2019ve never yelled like that in front of her before and just feel bad since it\u2019s her husband.

You are teaching your son how to be an emotionally healthy adult. Good job! As I have learned emotions are like colors there are more than the basic crayola 6 pack of crayon colors. There is a lot of them and they can be used together. People are allowed to feel how they feel, telling them they can\u2019t is WRONG. \n\nYou should apologize to your son for blowing up, and not controlling your emotions. And then I would suggest telling him a little bit about how you where treated growing up. Don\u2019t tell him traumatic stuff, but be honest. Same goes for your mom. My bet is she already knows that it is an issue between you and your dad. But didn\u2019t want to get involved, or doesn\u2019t see it as an issue.", "NTA\n\nYour father's attitudes are exactly why we see a proliferation of the Andrew Tate incel bunch, men who think they can't show any emotions otherwise they're losers who'll never get a woman or succeed in life.

Your dad\u2019s comments/opinions are really shitty and harmful and I think you were right to stand up to him. That said, make sure you talk with your son about what happened and process it with him. That\u2019s definitely a really upsetting thing for him to have witnessed \u2014 especially when he was right in the middle of going through his own personal stuff \u2014 and if there\u2019s going to be a separation from his grandfather, that will affect him too.\n\nGlad you are raising your son differently though. That\u2019s amazing. Breaking generational cycles isn\u2019t easy at all and you are doing it!", "NTA. He definitely did not need to make that comment, especially seeing as his grandson was distressed. I hope you've had the time to sit down with your son to explain what happened back there.", "NTA, your father never even cared about your emotions or feelings towards him, so how can he even expect for you to care about him?", "NTA. That being said your son is going to blame himself bc that\u2019s what kids do. Sit down with your father and explain that not only are things different now but there are studies that prove that coping with feelings and emotions is not only healthier but it helps folks deal and \u201cbe strong\u201d. You understand that his outburst comes from love but it is outdated and you want your child to have a safe emotional space to even cry in if that is necessary. This can be salvaged and if it can\u2019t then you sit down with your child and explain why you lost your temper (totally justified, I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t) and make it clear you need him to know that A) grandpa loves them but comes from a toxic time and B) they are always allowed to feel their feelings with you. Good luck you sound like an awesome dad.", "Nta dad sounds well... ugh", "NTA. Your parenting is sensible and there's no hard and fast rule that guys can't be emotional or so, your dad is expecting the whole world to follow his parenting.

Your father is borderline if not actually abusive, and he had zero rights to be interfering with your interactions with your son.\n\nTalk to your mother and your son, apologise for frightening them if necessary, and your father can go fish.

I would suggest though that you talk to your son. If you are vulnerable with him, are willing to apologize when you are wrong and admit fault, he will also do the same. Tell him the same things you wrote here and be sure to stress to him that you didn't cut his grandfather off because he pissed you off one time and you certainly aren't going to cut your son off for this reason. He may be scared ( as unreasonable as it is) that he caused the rift as well. So talk, communicate. It does wonders", "YTA. I'm sure you mean well, but this is not a good way to prepare your son for real life. Your father is right.", "NTA. What your mom and son witnessed was the result of bottling up your feelings for years. Today it was you verbally lashing out at your dad in response to something toxic he said. Unfortunately anger seems to be the only emotion that people with that mentality think men should have, which is incredibly unhealthy and will ruin relationships. \n\nBeing able to express yourself emotionally without judgement is freeing. Cry when you need to, yell when you need to. Laugh when you want to.", "NTA at all! My husband was also raised with the whole 'boys don't cry' mindset. (As well as the children should fear their parents bs) It has taken him a long time to realize that it's ok for men to be emotional and he has had to learn how to express his emotions properly. He tries, as do I, to be better than his, and my, parents with our girls.", "NTA - but make sure you tell your son that he is NOT at fault for the argument with your father.        \nThat it wasn\u2019t because of him and he did nothing wrong.       \nHe may be quiet at the moment because he thinks he caused the argument and he hurt your relationship with your father.", "NTA. Thank you for doing right by your son", "NTA. Your father had it coming. He laid his bed, now he has to sleep in it. I would recommend however that you talk to your son and explain to him how your childhood was and what you learned from it and how you wanted to have a close relationship with him and that's why you have always had your son's back. Because you wanted him to have a safe place with you and never wanting him to feel like he can't show what he's feeling. I really think if you explain everything to him he'll understand. You should also say that shouting is never the way and call your dad to apologise for shouting at him, and call while your son is with you so he learns that you can't behave certain ways without having to apologise. I think you both can \"learn a lesson\" from it and make it a bonding experience.\nBest of luck and don't you worry, you're an amazing dad.", "NTA - I would be yelling back \"you are f* up, and don't interrupt when people are having conversations you rude a*hole\" and leave.\n\nI think your son is old enough that you can explain to him your relationship with him and what you didn't like about it. \n\nAs of your mom, I'm pretty sure she understands.", "I once heard a woman say that the most terrifying thing in women's lives is the possibility of being in the presence of an angry man.\n\nThis may be why your son has been a bit distant. It was, no doubt, the first time he'd witnessed his calm, decent, approachable, emotionally available, stable loving father lose his absolute shit. He's probably a bit shell-shocked.\n\nBeing the good dad you clearly are, it might be worth sitting him down and explaining, if you have not already, why you reacted so viscerally to your own father's comments.\n\nAs for your own dad, well, 'manning up', 'being a man', 'acting manly' has been proven to be a very solid strategy for producing stable adult males. Not.\n\nYou know, first hand, what a toll this distance has taken on you and how hard you have had to work to break the cycle of chest-beating manliness whose only achievement is to alienate people and make relationships hard.\n\nNTA and you were absolutely right to stand up to your father although I imagine he was shocked to have his ears pinned back quite so forcefully. Well, he is reaping what he sowed so he cannot complain. Maybe he's calling to congratulate you on being 'manly' but I doubt it.\n\nFrom what you've written, it seems to this internet stranger that your son has very much fallen on his feet as far as his dad is concerned. Good job, good bloke, well done.", "NTA you protected and stood up for your kid. Your dad is an AH.", "NTA in this situation, but you should talk this out with your father.", "NTA speak to your son and explain the whole situation from start to finish about your dad. Help him understand why you reacted that way and apologize if you startled him. Your doing awesome. Hugssss", "Nta. Not allowing children to show emotion is both toxic and damaging. Also, you might want to apologize to your son. Let him know none of this is his fault. Kids tend to blame themselves when adults fight. You're a better father to your son than yours was to you.", "NTA.  As others have said, talk to your son a bit about your experiences.  It is good you have been able to break this cycle. It is surely how your father was raised and was taught to raise you.  Is it possible that he is now questioning the cycle himself?  That he didn't realize how upset you were by his treatment?  If there is a possibility that he could have a change of heart and want to repair your relationship, do things differently, would you be open to it?", "My late wife and I told both sets of our parents to butt out and don't 'correct' our way of parenting when our first child was born.  I got a lot of that 'guys are soft' today from my FIL and I just laughed at him.  I went NC with my dad in my early teens.  It is YOUR child, not theirs, raise it how you want and don't take unwelcome advice from parents...  NTAH.", "Your son is upset because he thinks it\u2019s his fault. Explain that you have held that in for 32 years and that is why you are so glad that he talks to you. Accept the fault for not dealing with it sooner and making him see you lose it. Reiterate that he did nothing and that grandpa was wrong about what he said. Hug him and tell you love him and the person he is that cares and is brave enough to show it. NTA", "NTA\n\nyou should explain in more detail to your son after the fact about what your dad did and why", "No, he  is not. The father failed OP, and OP is not failing his son. Having emotions and learning to navigate through them makes you a well-adjusted adult capable of self-regulating. If OP'S father had teach him that OP wouldn't have exploded 32 years of resentment and cut contact with him.", "Having emotions is not a good thing", "yeah- i think this is an important point. it can be hard for kids to understand that something happening isn't their fault.", "This was cathartic for me to read. For whatever it's worth, I'm proud of you. NTA", "I\u2019m not sure you realized you did this, OP, but you just showed your son being overly emotional can result in bad things like screaming, threatening, and kicking someone out of your life. Your son may be quiet because he might wonder when you will do the same to him that you did to dad. You need to be very careful about letting the pendulum swing too far opposite - you may have caused a lot of unintended damage with your son.", "He is not wrong this gen is fucked. Yta", "NTA, you dropped this \ud83d\udc51\n\nTell your son that you are sorry for blowing up in front of him. Ask him how he felt. Talk to him. Reassure him. He\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s 13 and you\u2019ve never lost your shit in front of him. You\u2019re doing great, and this one incident isn\u2019t going to fuck him up.", "NTA. FYI Chuck Norris is a fan of hugging and showing emotion. You protected your child, you stood up for yourself. And it might not be easy, but staying away from your father might be the best thing for you and your child.", "NTA. I wonder if he feels bad all of a sudden for treating you that way for all those years now that you're finally going no contact. You should text him back and tell him to man up and take your rejection like a man and stop being a sissy trying to call you.", "NTA - lmao at the old fart trying to contact you. I think he realized he can't have access to your child without you.", "NTA! Next time I'd throw in his face that it was HIM that made you this way so if he thinks you're raising your son the wrong way, guess who didn't \"raise you right\"?\n\nTo be clear: from this story, I think you're a great dad and don't believe you weren't raised right but since your dad has a weird sense of logic, I'd hurt his ego to be petty. \nAnd bonus! Because he will likely throw a fit and you could be even pettier and call him sensitive and insult his generation. I am pro petty but it's not for everyone, so just ignore this if that's not your cup of tea lol.\n\nRegarding your son: I'd try and talk to him. Tell him you're sorry for the yelling and try to explain where it came from.\n\nKeep up the good job with raising an emotional intelligent person! :)\nSorry for typos, English is not my native language.", "Question - have you expressed your thoughts about his behaviour before? I\u2019m trying to understand whether he knows that it\u2019s not something you condone.", "NTA", "Yes, the poor kid is probably blaming himself for the argument starting. I was this way until I realized I\u2019m not responsible for other people\u2019s feelings", "Especially if he\u2019s never seen them disagree before or his dad get so mad. Poor buddy.", "NTA\n\nYour father sounds toxic. Better to keep your kid away from him. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with him but you seem to have no only survived but are also now intent on breaking the cycle. That\u2019s great!!\n\nAlso don\u2019t feel bad about yelling at your mother\u2019s husband. She\u2019s an adult and she can handle it.", "Nta, but you need to talk to your son and explain the situation a bit more in general, you can skip the details but just let him know the fight wasn\u2019t his fault and the argument was always going to happen eventually, and that the fight wasn\u2019t over his actions but over your father criticizing your parenting and choices, let him know you support him and his grandfather\u2019s words weren\u2019t true and were due to your father\u2019s own trauma and abusive upbringing which he passed on to you and you refused to pass further", "Nta he was very inappropriate and tried to undermine your parenting. Your child, your choice. He overstepped the mark or rather fucked around and found out.", "Excellent point", "NTA- explain to your son why you got so angry. He'll learn the valuable lesson that sometimes we explode from pent up anger and that it's better to address issues when they occur instead of holding in the anger and resentment.", "NTA.\n\nMake sure your son knows he's not in trouble and he didn't cause the situation. Kids take all the blame on themselves.", "NTA, but I'd talk to your son about what happened, so you can all be on the same page. I'd hate for your relationship to take a hit because something went unspoken.", "NTA. This is a good time to teach your son why he shouldn\u2019t bottle his emotions. Yeah, maybe it scared him or shocked him, but explaining to him your upbringing vs how you are trying to raise him might be a good thing. \n\nGood thing for letting your dad know though. I can imagine it\u2019s hard being ridiculed every time you are feeling a normal human emotion", "Lol your dad sounds like a dick but it kind of sounds like he had a point.", "The funny thing is that these type of people often do show emotions - such as anger when they don't get their way.", "shit i didn\u2019t even think about that at all. Thank you! I\u2019ll explain that to him!", "You\u2019re a great father! And great on you for breaking that generational abuse. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom was like that and he internalizes all of his emotions. She would support him sometimes. But if he told her he was depressed, she would completely gloss over it or tell him it wasn\u2019t that deep. I wish he had someone like you to teach this to him. Your son will thank you one day", "You are nta op. In anyway. You are providing validation towards your son\u2019s very real emotions. While they may not be a big deal to everyone, they are a very big deal to him and you seem to understand and respect that. He will continue to visit you when you get older while your father will have no one. \n\nAnd yes, please have a discussion with your son about why you did and said those things. I feel like your son will be understanding of the situation once he knows why it happened. You sound like a wonderful man that has raised an incredible son. He will grow up knowing that you\u2019re a safe place for him and that he should never be ashamed of his feelings, especially when he is with you. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you need to hear this, but I\u2019m going to tell you anyways. You are a wonderful dad and a wonderful person. You seem like you\u2019re very empathetic and caring. Your father has in no way contributed to the man you are today. I hope he will now be forced to see what a kind, smart, successful, and caring man you have grown to be and that he\u2019ll come to the startling and brutal realization that he contributed nothing to that development. \n\nYour father did you a disservice, but rather than continuing and perpetuating that cycle of emotional abuse and invalidation, you are instead choosing to perpetuate emotional validity, not only for your son, but for yourself. I commend you for that. I respect that. Parents like you will be the reason that the vast majority of my generation grow up knowing that it\u2019s ok to not be ok, sometimes. Thank you."]}
