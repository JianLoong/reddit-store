{"id": 23029, "submission_id": "158fjqy", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that spending $10k on a wedding dress is wasteful given her financial circumstances?", "selftext": "This happened over the weekend and she still isn't talking to me so here we go. My friend (24f) is getting married next year, and is spending what I think is a ridiculous amount on a wedding dress. She doesn't have a high paying job, she's a public school teacher, and lives on a tight budget. Her fiance makes more money, he's in tech, but she told me they are splitting the cost of the wedding 1/3 her parents, 1/3 his parents, 1/3 them as a couple, so it's not like his salary is covering this dress.\n\nWe were out to brunch with a group of friends when her wedding came up, and she got out her phone to show us her wedding dress that she recently committed to. I was expecting something normal, a photo of her in a dress in a bridal shop, but it was just a sketch. Then she dropped the bomb that she's working with a designer to make a brand-new dress from scratch. This shocked me because she has never mentioned this before, and I asked some follow up questions about who the designer is, where she's getting this done, and how much it costs, and that's when she dropped the $10k amount. I told her that was way too much to spend on a dress, and she got super defensive. She's trying to justify it as her chance to try out fashion design, because she's the one who sketched this thing and it's apparently her dream dress from a design perspective that couldn't be purchased anywhere else.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole, because I didn't let it go. I told her that if she can't sew it herself, she can't call it her dress, because the actual designer is going to be the one doing all the work, and it's wasteful to spend that much money on a vanity project. She took this poorly and shut down for the rest of the outing, and one of our other friends texted me after and told me that I was being an asshole for telling her what she could or couldn't afford to do. The friend also told me that apparently they got their venue for free because it's owned by her fiance's family, and that the $10k for the dress was originally earmarked for the venue and that's what they're spending it on, but I still think it's just way too much money to spend on a dress because the venue would be for everyone but the dress is only for her. I probably shouldn't have confronted her about the cost in public, and I'm willing to apologize for that, but come on - this is way too much money for a public school teacher to spend on a dress, right??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit/update: I don't hate teachers, I am also a teacher.\n\nFinal update: It's clear that my friend and I need to part ways, even if everyone thinks I'm an asshole for doing so. Her morals and values have changed since meeting her fiance, and I miss the person she used to be, who would never have spent this much time or energy on flashy clothing. I have been more than polite to her fiance and his family but I'm realizing through this post and your comments ( the few of you that have been compassionate/helpful) that attending the wedding would be nauseating.", "created_utc": 1690216267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158fjqy/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_spending_10k_on_a/", "score": 1403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you care so much. It\u2019s her money. I hope you\u2019re not in the wedding party.", "YTA she is the one who is paying.

It is her day and she gets to decide what she wants and how much she is willing to spend", "YTA for nagging her but you\u2019re not wrong. That\u2019s an INSANE amount of money to spend on a dress unless you have f-you money", "YTA. It's not your money. You being so pushy about it is incredibly weird and inappropriate.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your wedding, not your money, not your relationship, not even your family. You have no stake in what she does or what her family does financially for the wedding, so why are you getting worked up over it? \n\nYou sound very unhappy, could it be possibly you have your own anxieties and this situation brought out a strong reaction in you?

No. Would I spend my money that way? No. But she's wanted that car for years and she paid cash for both so who am I to judge? \n\nYour friend is excited and happy and has made the necessary financial arrangements to afford the dress. You owe her an apology. As for the crack about her not really designing the dress because someone else is sewing it - Do you think Vera Wang or Pnina Tornai are out there sewing all the dresses that bear their names? You are ridiculous and you diminished someone's joy for no good reason. \n\nApologize and then stay out of it.", "Major YTA.

It's HER wedding  LOL", "You sound SOOOOO jealous and I wish your friend had the balls to call it out and embarrass you in the moment. Being judgmental as hell is a great way to have 0 friends by 30. Oh, and YTA.", "YTA. Yes, it's stupid. No you can't tell her that.", "Im sorry but people labeling YTA are wrong. I don't see where you say she couldn't afford it but just the fact that she should spend it more wisely. This turning point toward her future so she could've diverted the saving towards a honeymoon or down payment for a house. The best friends are the smart ones who tell you things upfront. She has poor financial choices so so someone has to say something. Many people often look back at their wedding and regret spending on some things. You're right the dress is gonna be one time thing then in the closet it goes, never to be worn again. NTA imo.", "Look, I agree with you on the sentiment, but it\u2019s not your business as it\u2019s not coming out of your pockets. YTA", "YTA\n\nThis was worse than I thought! \n\nLet's break it down: \n\n\n> Her fiance makes more money, he's in tech, but she told me they are splitting the cost of the wedding 1/3 her parents, 1/3 his parents, 1/3 them as a couple\n\n\nHer financial situation as a teacher is irrelevant because there are around six people paying for the wedding. At *least* one of them with a high salary. So straight away your argument is bs.\n\n\n> it's apparently her dream dress\n\n\nIt's her dream dress. If my friend had the opportunity to design her dream wedding dress I'd be elated for her. So happy. What kinda awful friend are you?!

She should be able to treat herself at her own wedding ffs.\n\n\n> but I still think it's just way too much money to spend on a dress because the venue would be for everyone but the dress is only for her.\n\n\nI *kinda* get this argument (and that's being generous), but  it came across as you thinking you and the guests should be put before the bride at her own wedding.\n\n\nAnything I've missed readers?\n\n\nIn all, it's not about you. Your tastes and priorities are your own and you had no good reason to push them onto her and shit all over her dream wedding. Terrible friend.", "YTA. It's not your dress, your money, or your wedding. You are entitled to have an opinion, but it doesn't mean anyone else wants to hear it, especially not the bride who is super excited about it.", "YTA.. like big time. Maybe she is not spending her money wisely but the key word here is \u201cher money\u201d so you don\u2019t get to express your unsolicited option unless she ask you.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s none of your business how much her shit costs. Unless she owes you $10k and hasn\u2019t paid you back yet, keep your mouth shut about her dress.", "YTA. Why do you care what she spends? Like ashes to the urn that\u2019s none of your concern. Is it your money? Is it your wedding? No and no.", "Yes it is way too much to spend.  Doesn\u2019t matter.  YTA.  Keep your trap shut, be supportive or say nothing, apologize, and be ready to be there for her when the marriage fails and she realizes the lesson she learned.", "It sounds like they have worked out a budget for the wedding and have prioritized certain things in their budget. It sounds like she knows how much she has to spend and is working with what is available to her. So what is your point, that public school teachers can't have nice things?

No, it is not, let her have the wedding that she wants despite her occupation.", "YTA \n\nThis is NONE of your fucking business, stay in your lane and shut up.\n\nIn case you forgot, this is YOUR FRIEND\u2019S WEDDING!

If not, then hush up, slap a fake smile on your face, and keep your opinions to yourself. \n\nIf this friend doesn't drop you like a hot potato and she has a baby at some point, I'm going to save you from sticking your foot in your mouth again. When anyone asks you if you think the baby is pleasant to look at in any way, the answer is gonna be yes. I don't care if it's green, covered in warts and slime, and has 4 eyes and horns. Tell her the baby is cute as all get out.", "YTA. You sound bitter that your friend has more money now and you\u2019ve convinced yourself she\u2019s still poor. \n\nHer future husband has a high paying tech job, and their parents are covering a big portion of cost. Why do you *assume* she can\u2019t afford the dress? Because of her salary? Do you know what being married means? THEY obviously can afford this \u201cvanity project.\u201d The idea that because she didn\u2019t sew it, it isn\u2019t hers, is so incredibly idiotic I don\u2019t believe you actually hold that opinion.

She\u2019s buying it on a teachers salary, a tech salary, and two sets of parents salaries. It was even clarified that the venue was free so they can spend more on the dress. It makes complete sense. You\u2019re just arguing for the sake of arguing. Why do you care? \n\nIf I was your friend I\u2019d never speak to you again.

It\u2019s really none of your business how people spend their money. Also, rude to assume that because she\u2019s a public school teacher that she isn\u2019t able to afford to purchase something nice.

While I agree it's way too much to spend on a dress, it really is none of your business. She can spend $20,000 on a dress for all you matter in this equation.

Lovely evening still, but I'm a little disappointed in the end.", "I guess all of OPs clothing, if she didn\u2019t sew them, aren\u2019t hers using this logic.  \n\nI guess since I didn\u2019t build my car from scratch I can\u2019t call it mine\u2026..Dumbest shit I\u2019ve heard in a while and this poster claims to be a teacher \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "2nding this!! i can understand pulling aside and gently expressing concern to a close friend who frequently begs for money or is in consistent, dier financial need... but OP did it in front of a group of people even though they stated the parents are paying for 2/3 of the expenses, friend and husband are probably both salaried jobs based on work described, and husband has a decent job, so imo it's a non-issue. Also, from what is described, the friend had the resources available to them and had already designed and paid to commission the dress.

I used a formal dress pattern from the 40s, made a calico mockup, once I was happy with the pattern I made up the bodice and skirt separately so I could apply silk lace appliques and hand beading. So if you've got 4 months to spare, you could claim your own wedding dress.", "I think it's jealousy...and self-righteousness.

She considers her friend \"materialistic.\"", "It's jealousy, but it's also mixed up in a lot of moralizing. I don't think, on a conscious level, OP is mad because she wants that dress. I think OP is mad because it's deeply ingrained in her that even *wanting* an expensive custom dress is **immoral**. This is greed. This is sin. The friend was supposed to be moral and selfless and giving and unmatricalistic, and now that her true, base colors are revealed, OP is disgusted.

I'd show her something I like, and half the time she would start sending me cheaper options that weren't even close to what I wanted. Example, once I mentioned getting under eye fillers because I always look tired, and she sent me a link for eye masks, as if I hadn't already tried that. Anyway, I said \"had\" a friend because we no longer talk. She was always jealous and it got to the point I didn't want to share anything good that happened to me with her because she would find a way to make me feel bad about it. \nOP is definitely in the wrong and probably gonna lose her friend soon.", "OP's friend wasnt even been snobbish , she was just talking about the dress and how excited she was to work with a designer and designing it herself.

Yet OP refers to it as \"flashy clothing\", proof of poor values, and sufficient reason to end the friendship. OMG judgy much, OP?\n\nOP's reference to \"the few of you who have been compassionate/helpful\" is a way of dismissing almost all commenters and rejecting their judgment. Isn't this a refusal to accept judgment, which would violate one of the most important rules of the sub?", "That's my thought as well. OP is jealous because they are a teacher and can't afford nice things, so they think their friend who is also a teacher also shouldn't have nice things.", "Exactly!

Yes, that's a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a dress, but it sounds like the budget can actually cover it, and even if it couldn't that's no one's issue but the bride and groom.
