If I were in similar cirumstances it would take a court order and a riot squad to get me to allow my children to even speak to these people ever again.\n\nIf they can lie about something so serious, imagine what other poison they could be dripping into those poor kids ears. \"Sorry darling, we had to put down Fluffy because you're mummy didn't say bless you when Daddy sneezed!\".\n\nNTA a lot!", "I love the Bad Boys quote, I grew up on those movies because of my mom \ud83d\ude02 but it is really great advice because it's the same as \"fuck around and find out\": she fucked around and she found out. Simple as that", "There are the AITA posts that could be solved with communication and maybe therapy, and then there are the ones where I\u2019m shocked that it hasn\u2019t come to blows already; This is definitely the latter.  \nHow fucking dare her sister pull this shit on top of everything else. If she wants to be trashy and fuck her sister\u2019s husband, she deserves the trailer park-style Stone Cold Stunner response to her shenanigans.  \nOf course OP is probably a reasonable adult who doesn\u2019t resort to violence because she probably doesn\u2019t want to go to jail, but man do some people need to meet a hick with nothing left to lose and an attitude of \u201cIDGAF, I\u2019ll go back to jail for this one\u201d.", "This alone has to raise red flags for the older children.", "Auntie Stepmom? Sounds like something you'd have to pay extra for on certain adult websites!", "What were they supposed to do? Tell the kids it was a lie, and then not offer the truth? The mom was suddenly confronted with the issue and only shared info because she had to.", "So is the mom supposed to take the shit given to her?? NTA OP", "No it\u2019s good for kids to understand how shitty their father is. I wish I learned how shitty mine was at a younger age. He is also a gross pervert.", "Once the sister lied to the children the OP's choices were to sacrifice her own reputation to the lie or correct the story.  The children would be hurt either way.  Why should she let her sister destroy her relationship with her children as well as her marriage? \n\"If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.\" Carl Sagan", "I\u2019m sorry but when the other adult throws blame and shade at you - they are already involved and you have to right to defend yourself by simply telling the truth.  If she added untruths it would be one thing but clearing the air after having already been painted bad isn\u2019t unexpected or on her.  It sucks the kids were involved but OP didn\u2019t pull them in", "The sister straight up lied and created this whole situation and you want her to lie to her kids to solve the problem. It would be stopping to her level if she told them a lie. Telling the truth in this case is better because just like you said when they get older they are gonna be wondering why their father is married to their aunt. And they will find out and how do you think they are gonna react to being lied all those year.", "They forced her hand really - a lie like this from a guilty step-mom / aunt trying to throw anyone else under the bus is inexcusable and cannot be allowed to stand.", "...and then lying about who was the REAL cheater.", "It read to me like instead of preserving their opinion of their father by not providing details and blaming the lying aunt, OP flat out blamed the dad, and on top of that encouraged her kids to fact check her version of events with other family members to force them to choose a side.", "I was one of a few kids in my friend group growing up who still had both parents married to each other and genuinely thought the Disney/Pantomine trope of \"Evil Stepmum\" was, for the most part, an exaggeration. OP's sister seems to confirm this as 100% \"Myth Confirmed\".", "Probably the wife of a different sibling", "I am really hoping it\u2019s his brother\u2019s wife.", "Literally", "The oldest kids, maybe. A six year old does not need to be given these sordid details at that point in time.", "This. This mom was not going to tell them. If they\u2019re being lied to, especially about the mom, they now need the truth. The sister was trying to turn these kids against their own mother. If the little one hadn\u2019t broken down about, she may not even have known for years. There may have been a better way to handle it, but I think OP did well on the spot.", "There is nothing in my response that suggests lying! The response I suggested is 100% true. No one is entitled to know every detail of someone\u2019s personal life, especially when it comes to kids. There are things that are not appropriate for certain ages. If a kid were to ask me why I didn\u2019t tell them the whole story I\u2019d simply explain that 1) why my relationship with their father ended is none of their business and 2) while I May no longer love their dad it\u2019s not my place to try and damage his relationship with his kids.", "Asking someone to speak objective truth isn't \"forcing someone to choose a side,\" and the other family members can simply say, \"I don't know, I wasn't there.\"\n\nRemove the cheating from the equation:\n\nKid 1, crying, \"mom my aunt said you did ____ and it upset me.\"\n\nMom, \"Really? Girls did she say that to you?\"\n\nOther kids, \"yes.\"\n\nMom, \"I didn't do that, ask your grandparents.\"\n\n*What makes OP the asshole?*", "All we have is \"I told them the truth. They didn't believe me. I told them to ask their dad or other family members if they didn't believe me.\"\n\nIs there another comment where OP details what was said that I've missed?", "I'm an adult whose father remarried when my mother passed away. I was still going to college when they married. So I was poor, I occasionally relied in help and I did not always dress the best or look my best. I stayed up so many night studying engineering. She didn't like the way I present myself, and there are other habits she grew to dislike. She doesn't know me like my mother did, and franky I don't appreciate her judgment or her superficial priorities all the rime either. I can DEFINITELY understand people having issues with stepparents.", "\"No, I'm not the one that cheated. Ask your dad or other family members if you dont believe me about it.\"\nDoesn't sound like sordid details.\n\nThe text we have doesn't even really say what was said to the children.", "First it is omission of a the Truth because you are making them believe it to be one way rather then how. Actually played out. Second the mother did not go into detail she explain how the father cheated on her with her sister. Did she bad mouth them or tell the kids to hate the father ? No that was the intention of the sister and giving her kids your answer would have not satisfied there curiosity. Who in their right mind would except kids not to push the mother after she would have given your half answer."]}
