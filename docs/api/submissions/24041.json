This is what can be used in courts.", "I am a divorce attorney, and I'm here to tell you that (depending on the laws and practices of your jurisdiction) this is not necessarily the slam-dunk that everyone seems to think it is. \n\n\"Parental alienation\" is one of those phrases that gets tossed around a lot in divorce cases these days. It's quite common, of course, for people going through a divorce to want their children to \"side with\" them and not the other parent, and to try, consciously or unconsciously, to provide narratives that encourage this. And this is bad behavior by whatever parent does it, and should not be encouraged. The trouble is that we have an increasing tendency to pathologize behavior. This has become ubiquitous in divorce and other domestic relations cases. He's not just oblivious and self-absorbed, he's \"a narcissist.\" She's not just emotional and disregulated, she's \"bipolar.\" It's not just parents talking badly, it's \"parental alienation.\" \n\nI don't mean to defend any of these behaviors. But I also want to acknowledge the context in which these pseudo-psychological explanations are offered. We live in an era in which conventions of shared etiquette and courtesy have broken down. It no longer impresses anyone if you tell them that your ex-husband is an AH. Everyone's ex-husband is an AH. But if he's a \"narcissist\" - ah! then your complaint must be valid. Then you must be entitled to institutional acknowledgement and protection. \n\nOf course this is not how it really works. Mental health diagnoses like this (even if they were made by a competent and objective mental health professional, which 99% of the time they are not) are irrelevant to a person's legal rights. And, I hasten to emphasize, everyone's pain is valid, and everyone deserves institutional protection of their rights, compatible with like protection for the rights of others. You shouldn't need your ex to be a \"narcissist\" for him to be held accountable for his behavior. (If anything, slapping a diagnosis on the behavior may somewhat let him off the hook.) \n\n(I find it fascinating how some mental health conditions, in the zeitgeist, have become inherently inculpatory - like, we assume that \"narcissism\" is a shorthand for \"bad person\" - and certain others have become inherently excuplatory - \"I have PTSD, how can they evict me just because I didn't pay my rent\" is also something I've had said to me in my career. You could write a whole dissertation on this.) \n\n\"Parental alienation\" is like this. It's a real thing, and a problem; but it can be very difficult for courts or therapists to draw a clear line between that, and just, parents being bitter and letting it leak through to their kids. We try not to take away people's rights - such as their right to meaningful relationships with their children - unless we're really confident they're doing something substantively wrong. And it's very difficult for courts to police, or even detect, how people talk to their children in the privacy of their own homes. \n\nYou indicated that the stepmother may have been telling the children that you broke up the marriage. Of course that is not true from your perspective; but without more information, a lot more, it's hard to say that it may not be true from hers. People in divorce cases often, unsurprisingly, have really different narratives about the end of their relationship. Not all these are necessarily equally accurate; but they sure feel that way to the people expressing them. People are amazing at rationalizing their behavior. We don't know what your ex-husband's take on all this is, or whether there's missing information. In any event, that statement, without more - even if proved, which is a big If, given the legal prohibitions on hearsay testimony - would not likely decisively end a custody dispute. \n\nOP, I'm sorry, but YTA. Not for the end of your marriage, or for your understandable anger at your ex and his new partner (also your sister - that does feel sketch as hell, obvs.); but the fact is, you shouldn't tell children as young as 6 these intimate details, even if there's some indication that your co-parent may have done so. If they have been told specific things that are not true, you can and should deny them; but what you should say - what the courts would expect you to say, in my state at least - is simply that you and their father disagree about this; but you both love them and will continue to be there for them even if now you're living apart.", "I agree that even if a lawyer doesn't think any drastic change will result from bringing this up, it's still important to have it on record that the children are all distressed because of stepmother/aunt and dad's false narrative.", "I have an 11 year old (the age eldest was when parents divorced).

In fact, you said it yourself, those types of labels don't mean we can violate someone's civil rights. \n\nAlso, of course it isn't a slam dunk case. If we only pursued our rights when it was a \"slam dunk\" then we'd miss a lot of opportunities to stand up for ourselves when someone is violating our rights. OP has a right to have a good relationship with her children. The children themselves are able to communicate what the step mom said. Of course, it is up to the judge to decide if that is an issue. However, even if it is not immediately an issue, making a record of the problem with the courts is important. Given the stepmom's behavior,  this likely won't be the last time she tries to poison the children against her. \n\nThe whole, \"it's not a slam dunk case\" comment is sus.

Family court is an ongoing situation that changes over time. It isn't like a basic civil lawsuit where you sue someone for violating your rights and then it is over. It is an ongoing situation that lasts until the child is 18 or care is no longer needed. The idea that it is frivolous for a parent to file with the court about  a serious issue seems to come from a misguided idea that family court follows the structure of civil suits. It doesn't. And maintaining involvement with the family courts in a hostile coparenting situation is important for the victim of a toxic step parent. I could see your type of description of it being \"frivilous lawsuit\" if this was a civil case. But it is not."]}
