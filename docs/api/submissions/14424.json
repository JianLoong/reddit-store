I (36f) and husband (30m) raised his sister (12f) for over 4 years. She went back to her mom we will call her Sally recently. Ever since she has been back with her mom she has had lice. Like for months. Today they came over for Easter and I saw the child scratching her head. So I checked her head for lice. I asked the sister to put her hair up. I then went to find my husband to tell him what was going on. He then pulled his mom aside and mentioned that his sister still has lice. Sally completely lost her mind and started says all kinds of stuff. She called me a bitch with my kids standing right there. The only thing l said was she was not going to call me names with my kids right there. I went inside to try to avoid further drama. So AITA for checking her hair? I only did it because I need to protect my kids from it.", "created_utc": 1681091725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h3e9k/aita_for_checking_my_sister_in_laws_hair_for_lice/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having lice for months would be miserable. Either the child is never fully rid of them, or she is continually being exposed to them. That poor child! It sounds like it\u2019s time for some professional help with the situation.", "NTA \n\n\nLice isn't even as hard to treat anymore as it was. Why isn't her mother handling this properly?", "NTA.\n\nChronic lice is a tale tale sign for child neglect. Saw in another comment that you said that they are living in a hotel and the child\u2019s A/B grades have slipped to F\u2019s. There are clearly issues. Call CPS.", "NTA - I'm literally scratching my head while typing. So many reason you're NTA: Protect your kids, you care about SIL, and lice is a challenge to eradicate.\n\nPerpetual lice is a problem. It could indicate the SIL is being neglected. Yes, if subjected to kids with lice your SIL can repeatedly have it but regular intervention fall to her parents. There is likely more to this story. Please do what you can to care for this 12 year old who may need you more than you know.", "Absolutely NTA - get Vammouse. It\u2019s the only thing that has worked for when I was in the same situation with relatives who wanted their kids to stay with us.  You can send her home with the shampoo and surface sprays to keep it away but the Vammouse kills all the lice in one shot.  Not taking care of this is like child abuse IMO as kids can\u2019t get to the store on their own or doctor on their own.  NTA 1000000%", "A hundred thousand times NTA.  What, did Sally think it was OK for her kid to give head lice to your kids and everyone else present?  From the sound of Sally, I wish you could get your SIL back.", "NTA - in what world would you be?!", "NTA\n\nAnyway for you to have her round for a couple of fun sleepovers and treat her?", "op-NTA\n\nyou have a right not to have a household infestation because Sally cannot do her job as a parent.", "NTA. When my SD came to live with us full-time it was after two years of what we had thought had been on-and-off lice infestations but we later were told by two lice professionals were just intransigent lice that she had had continuously for two years (based on the size and number). She had anemia from the lice. Even once she lived with us full-time it took a year of treatment at home and two separate lice treatment centers, and three courses of two different prescriptions (one a cream, one a pill) to get rid of the infestation. In the meantime, she had lost so much iron that she had to be on prescription iron supplements. \n\nWhat you are aware of with your SIL could lead to a medical condition. Call CPS.", "NTA. You  did not do anything wrong. The opposite. You have shown up for children who are not yours but who need you. \n\nTry, tho, to be sensitive and compassionate towards someone who is not capable of being there for their own child. You cared for them instead? And as lucky as the kids are for that? This is going to be a sore spot. Especially when you are noticing something that reflects a less than ideal household situation. You didn't do anything wrong. But please think about how that might have hit her. And be gentle.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sally\u2019s reaction was completely uncalled for and based on your comments she seems like a neglectful parent.", "NTA. A child's health is always more important than an adult's feelings. An adult who thinks otherwise isn't qualified to be a parent.", "Nta get CPS involved. This is not right", "She could be getting re-exposed somewhere like school. Funnily enough if that\u2019s the case then once she\u2019s treated for the lice and nits putting product like gel and hair spray in her hair daily can help prevent her catching them again. Lice like clean hair.", "NTA you were protecting your kids and environment! That poor child should not still have lice! So sad!", "NTA lice should not be ignored. Licetreatments can be very expensive, maybe gift niece, some socozy or tea tree oil shampoo might ease her scratches a bit. I hope the mom decides to deal with the lice issue", "NTA. My dad let this happen to me in 7th grade. I'm 43 now and still permanently emotionally scarred from this. Someone really needs to call the authorities to intervene, because if this child has live bugs in their hair like I did, other things are being severely neglected as well. You would only be the AH if you don't report the mother.", "If I could afford to have everyone treated in her home I would do it in a heart beat. I have also offered to treat the moms head. She has never gotten rid of them. The nits were pretty far down.", "I honestly think she doesn't know how and doesn't care to learn. I have sent home supplies and offered to treat everyone in the house hold.", "Over and over and over again. \nNTA", "I wish we could to. Since going back home they have lost their apartment and are living in a extended stay. She went from A/B honor roll to all Fs. She has missed kbee 20 days of school. CPS was called a while back and didn't do anything. It's a whole mess. DCFS has failed this child more then once.", "I have treated her hair several times. But the mom has them too and it does nothing if her mom won't get her head treated and won't allow me to do follow up treatments", "I apologized for upsetting her before I went into the house. I did go to my husband so he could talk to his mom because she is very sensitive to anything I do or sat. I really did try my hardest not to upset the mom.", "Kids deserve to be treated for lice.  Not taking care of it seems abusive IMO.  The parent is embarrassed?  They brought it on themselves by not handling it.  Free clinics even treat for lice", "This is a matter for CPS", "Yeah, those buggers aren\u2019t easy to get rid of, especially if she has constant reexposure. For what it\u2019s worth, and it may be out of your control, using cetaphil is cheap and easy and works like a dream. Just google using cetaphil with lice and you will find instructions. This worked when my daughter was getting exposed at school. The easiest and most effective method I have ever used. However, your problem is with the mom and I\u2019m not sure how to address it. Consider contacting the school? Maybe they can give the mom some support in getting rid of the lice.", "And if that's the case, she needs to keep her child at home.", "Fuck man. Shit situation.", "OP yr ok! it's sad for mom and kids when she can't care for them. That you are picking up her slack? Speaks so well of you. it's sad. But one these days the kids will understand what you have done for them. Probably. Try to empower the mom tho. They need her too.", "Agree x1000!! these kids are so lucky to have OP. All I am saying is mom is already busted and devastated. Just trying to be sensitive to her plight as well. Adults take care of the kids first order of business. Lice is a problem and needs to be dealt with. If mom can't do that? Mom might not be able to parent. And sad but that's not OP's fault. But approaching her with compassion because it sucks to have your kids slip through your fingers? That's all I'm saying.", "100%.", "It's not that hard, honestly. You just have to stay on top of it.", "Agreed but she swears up and down its gone. Then I decide to check because I see itching and she will still have it.", "It's a very shitty situation. And the only true victim is my SIL.", "You need the call CPS. There is no way she can't see live bugs.", "As a mandatory reporter this is child neglect. Call CPS.", "OP, it might not help get rid of them entirely, but my mum used to add tea tree oil to my water spray bottle when I was a kid. In my 20s and when my eldest son started kindergarten, i started doing it again. Now in my 30s I'm still doing it and getting my 1yr old used to using water spray with her hair so I can use it on her, (her brothers hair I keep short and they spray their own hair now.\n\nNTA anyway, but you need to report this. If not to CPS, then at least to the kids' schools since they are spreading it around other kids and households."]}
