For her birthday, she wants to go swimming, so we rented the local community center that has a pool and a giant activity room where we\u2019ll have lots of treats and stuff. We asked her to make us a list of invitees so we can get everything coordinated. She asked if she could just invite her whole class of 20 or so kids. It\u2019s a big activity center with lots of room so we said that was fine.\n\nSo she goes to the kitchen and about ten minutes later comes back with her classmate \u201cdirectory.\u201d Her school puts together a small binder that lists the names of the students by each class, the names of the parent(s), and a phone number and/or email address. She hands it to me and I quickly notice that three names have been crossed out. I asked why, and she said those are the ones she doesn\u2019t want to invite. I started asking her other questions, like if they had an argument, or if they were mean, bullies, etc., and she maintained that no, she just thought they were strange and didn\u2019t really like them. I told her that she can\u2019t just invite the whole class with just three exclusions. She just kind of looked at me and said it\u2019s her birthday. I explained that this could be hurtful to them, and that if she was so staunchly against them attending, then it would be better to have a smaller party and invite just a handful of her closest friends. She said she doesn\u2019t want a small party, she wanted a big party, and I told her then everyone in the class is getting an invitation. She said no, they aren\u2019t, and I told her okay, then no one is and she ran out of the room crying. She has started crying and running away whenever she has seen me since and I\u2019m starting to feel guilty.\n\nMy wife was frustrated with me and says that she gets where I\u2019m coming from, but it IS daughter\u2019s birthday and she should only have the people she wants there. I tried to explain that I don\u2019t want our daughter to be a reason these three kids have a crappy time in school. I can\u2019t in good conscience let her exclude other kids like this.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Wife says all we need to worry about is daughter having a fun birthday and I\u2019m already ruining for picking a fight over something no one will remember years down the road, but I don\u2019t agree at all. If they were bullies, that would be one thing. But they aren\u2019t, so to me, it\u2019s cruelty.

As a teacher, I personally do believe kids should be able to pick who they want and not be forced to invite the whole class. This is a special day for them, and in the real world you DONT include everyone, as much as it sucks.\n\nHowever, inviting such a large percentage and then leaving out just 3 is really rough. Any way to edit things a bit, does she mostly have girlfriends and the 3 are guys so maybe leave out all of the guys and make it an all girl party?? \n\nI feel like in a class of 20, maybe leaving 7ish off is okay, but when you start getting down the the smaller numbers it\u2019ll hit those kids hard.\n\nWhatever you do, send the invites outside of school if not everyone is invited. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d suggest you talk to the teacher. Your daughter may not want to share the real issue.\n\nNAH", "NTA. Kudos for teaching her right vs. wrong. Maybe turn it around and ask her how she would feel if she was one of three excluded from a classmate\u2019s birthday party.", "I can understand your point. However, speaking as someone who was ostracized as a kid, I can tell you that I would rather NOT be invited as opposed to being invited out of \u201cobligation.\u201d You\u2019re not doing the uninvited kids any favors, because it will be painfully obvious that they really aren\u2019t welcome.", "I can't say you're the A here because you have good intentions and want to take this opportunity and teach your daughter a lesson of kindness. \n\nThat being said... 11-12 yo is a weird age when you start to tell your friends more than you tell your parents, so it could end up being worse to force your child to invite those three kids because she's going to tell her friends at school that she was made to invite them in order to have her party, it could already be too late in that regard if she already vented to her friends about you \"being unfair\".  \n\n\"They are strange\" could mean A LOT of things at 11-12 yo: lack of common interest, minor bullying incidents, rudeness, ADHD, conflicting personalities, lack of personal awareness, general bad hygiene, gender segregation, general early pre-teen pettiness or maybe the don't attend class much and she doesn't really know them. I suggest contacting the teacher to get a general idea of the interactions your daughter has with those kids to get to root of her reluctance to invite them.", "I don't know that I feel comfortable calling you an asshole for this because, ultimately, your heart is in a good place.\n\nIt does suck to feel excluded, and when it's only 3 people they are probably going to feel that way. On the other hand, our brains do this thing called thin-slicing. You ever have a feeling that someone is just...off? And they haven't really overtly done anything to you to make you feel that way but there's this nagging feeling that something isn't quite right? That's an example of thin-slicing. It's basically your brain's ability to make a judgement based off of very limited interaction or information. Sometimes it can be biased but, overall, it's pretty accurate. I would caution against teaching your daughter to ignore her gut instinct, if that is in fact what's happening. She simply may not have the language or knowledge to articulate to you the reasons why she feels the way she does. That doesn't necessarily make her wrong. And teaching her to ignore those signals could ultimately put her is a dangerous position someday.\n\nI think there's NAH and you should delve a little deeper into this conversation with your wife and then your daughter.", "Tricky. As there is still some time, try to figure out, why your daughter doesn't want them to be at her birthday party. \"Strange\" is actually not a really satisfying answer. Perhaps there has been a situation at school or something else.  \nI agree with you: Every child should be included. The problem is, if your child starts to exclude them, other children might follow that idea. And suddenly your child is the \"bully\".  \nYour wife is somehow right as well when she says that it's your daughter's birthday. However, your daughter is 11/12 years old and children at that age are just mean sometimes.  \nTo me, NTA.", "YTA - I know this might be controversial but I was a kid \"not long ago\" and I was friends with most people in my class but there were definitely kids that I didn't like/didn't get along with that I didn't want in my birthday party and I've always thought it was unfair that I had to invite everyone... My mom had the same opinion as you, everyone should be invited and I shouldn't leave anyone out, but at the end of the day it's their party and it will just be uncomfortable for the guests because they will know they are not wanted - trust me, kids are ruthless and will go above and beyond if they are unhappy with the situation. I think you're just gonna end up making your kid unhappy and the other 3 kids as well - will your daughter and her friends actually include them in the activities or will they just show up to the party and be left out by everyone for a couple hours? Which scenario is best?\n\nIf they were toddlers I'd understand, kids that young are friends with grass if need be, but they are at the age to have people that they like and dislike.", "YTA. I\u2019m so sick of this idea of every single person needing to be included in every single thing. It\u2019s a birthday party for your child. Your child should get to choose who she invites.

Not everything has to be fair to everybody all the time", "This is a tough one, but I am going to say YTA. I understand wanting to teach your daughter to be kind and inclusive, but not at the expense of her own feelings or comfortable. Women are taught from young age that we have to be nice and considerate of other peoples feelings sometime at the expense of our own. I understand what you are trying to do but you are also telling your daughter she can't celebrate her birthday with the people she wants to because it would be rude to the kids that aren't invited. You are telling her she has to make her celebration about including other people.", "yta. at that age she\u2019s old enough to invite who she wants to", "YTA. I was the kid in class that had to be forced to be around the weird kids. I was partnered with them and told that I was helping them. I fucking hated it. \n\nI'm not saying your daughter is forced to do this. But I totally get why she doesn't want them at HER party. \n\nWhen she's a teenager and she throws a birthday party, are you still going to force her to invite people she doesn't like? Because to me you're teaching your daughter that other people's feelings matter more than hers. Do you think other kids who possibly don't like your daughter will invite her? And if that does happen, what are you going to tell her? \n\nYour kids feelings should matter more to you than strangers you don't know.", "I want to comment on this as a teacher: very few things will make me despise and think I'll of you as a person, parent and thinking creature than allowing your kid to do this shit to a classmate. \n\nOne of my students last year invited 8 out of 10 boys to his birthday party, and the parents didn't understand how that was shitty, since it was their precious baby's birthday.\n\nDon't be a shitty parent.

A good rule of thumb is either the whole class or less than half.", "Eh\u2026.If she\u2019s allowed to have a small birthday and pick the guest list, why can\u2019t she have the same guest list at the big party? If she was 5 or 6 I\u2019d understand this sentiment, but at 12 kids start to figure out who they are and they\u2019re not all going to be friends. Learning that you\u2019re not going to be invited to everything is a part of life, and it sounds like SHE wouldn\u2019t be too bummed if those 3 kids didn\u2019t invite her to their parties. Let her have her party with the friends she chooses. As an adult, you certainly wouldn\u2019t invite people you didn\u2019t particularly care for\u2026why make her?\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019d also take into account that she might not be telling you why she doesn\u2019t want those particular children there.", "YTA - everyone can\u2019t be invited to everything. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be forced to invite people she\u2019s not comfortable with to her birthday party. She\u2019s old enough to decide who she wants to spend time with.

I get where you\u2019re coming from but it\u2019s her birthday, and if she doesn\u2019t like them she doesn\u2019t have to invite them. It could be detrimental to her when she grows up making her think that she has to \u2018like\u2019 people she doesn\u2019t like. If they make her uncomfortable in a way maybe that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want them there but you\u2019re forcing it on her before threatening to cancel the party entirely. Also, for the \u201ccruelty sticks with people\u201d thing, the same could be said for your daughter if you force her to invite said children.", "NTA. Think of how bad those three little kids would feel when all of the others are talking about what a great time they had at the birthday party. You gave her the option of having a smaller party, but she refused. I think you're handling this right and your wife needs to support you 100% on this.", "NTA. If your wife lets your daughter exclude three kids for just being weird, they\u2019d both be bullies. It seems you want your daughter to be better than that.", "No, definitely NTA. It would be one thing if she wasn\u2019t inviting the major majority of the class but to just exclude three kids she thinks are weird? That\u2019s not ok. I honestly feel like a lot of schools require if you\u2019re inviting that many that you have to invite the whole class. \n\nI see how your wife does say well it is her birthday and if she doesn\u2019t want them but this is also a great time to teach acceptance if she insists on inviting the whole class. But, I do feel like you are correct in a smaller party or the whole class.

You are teaching your daughter that her opinions and choices do not matter", "You're in a tough spot wanting to teach inclusivity while respecting your daughter's birthday wishes. It's natural for kids to have closer friends, so forcing her to invite everyone might be uncomfortable for her and the uninvited kids.

You're not wrong for caring about everyone's feelings, but balancing this with your daughter's happiness on her special day is key.", "Most schools near me require ALL Students to be invited if handed out in school bc of this very reason. It would be one thing if she was only inviting the girls or half the class but all but 3? That\u2019s bordering on bully behavior.

Thank you for looking out for the underdogs.", "While I get that you're trying to do the right thing, forcing her to invite everyone will probably just make it worse. These aren't toddlers, they're old enough to understand when other kids don't like them and they will probably realize she only invited them because you forced her to. That can be more hurtful than just being left out, because you're basically getting a \"pity invite\" and it makes other kids see you as a baby or someone who needs the adults to give them special treatment.

But by the age of 11/12, there are definite risks to associating yourself with the strange kids in class and most people stop doing the \"everyone is invited\" parties at much younger ages.\n\nWhile the class outcasts may not have done anything to make your child not want them at their party, they could have a very valid fear that if they invite them, then the bullies in the class will group your child with the weirdos and they will start being bullied.\n\nAnd don't forget that there is always the chance that your child is already friends with the bullies who make fun of the weirdos and knows that inviting them would cause her own friends to shun her.\n\nThey say that where boys use physical violence to vie for social positon, girls use psychological methods. If you force her to do something she doesn't want to do, it is likely because she knows it will mess up her social hierarchy, and you can't underestimate how important that is to teenagers, not just in their imaginations, but in the ramifications for how her peers treat her now and through highschool.\n\nTry to get her to explain what she fears will happen if you force her to invite the outcasts.

At 12 those other kids have more than enough potential to be terrible shit heads if not complete creeps.

Definitely teach your kid we always take others into consideration", "YTA- It's her birthday, she should get to invite who she wants. Why force her to potentially ruin her day for the comfort of individuals she doesn't like/get along with? What if she was friends with the entire class, just not those 3?

In the future when she is excluded from some event, and doesn't understand why its ok for them to do it, but not for her, what will you do then? Socialization is a learned skill from both negative and positive feedback, if you try to subdue the negativity all that is going to create is individuals with and unearned sense of entitlement.I understand the values you are trying to instill. However, there are other ways to go about it. We all discriminate to a certain degree, and as she grows up, she'll do it more and more. All you're really proving here is that her feelings come secondary to others, so long as they're happy she doesn't matter.", "YTA. I\u2019m so tired of the everyone has to be included or nobody is.

It\u2019s the same here, someone doesn\u2019t need to be a bully or start an argument with you for you to not like them, maybe they\u2019re rude, like to annoy her, tease her, rub her the wrong way or just creep her out but she\u2019s 11 so she can\u2019t articulate this so just called them strange. \n\nAt the end of the day she\u2019s 11, not a little kid, most 11 year olds wouldn\u2019t be hurt if a random kid in their class that they aren\u2019t friends with doesn\u2019t invite them to their party. And if they are alittle hurt that sucks but it sucks even more to not be in control of the guestlist for your own party because you don\u2019t like 3 people in class, what makes you think these kids even want to come? If your daughter doesn\u2019t like them there\u2019s a good chance the feeling is mutual", "I get what you\u2019re trying to do and it doesn\u2019t seem bad.

Then your daughter needs to understand that harmless \"strange\" behaviour is not something you exclude someone over. However sometimes strange is an age appropriate way of explaining \"makes me feel uncomfortable in a way I can't explain\". And that is something to allow some discretion over. Maybe that's why she's crying. \n\nOf course she could just be being mean herself and crying to make you feel bad but that's what I mean when I say, you need to get to the bottom of what she means by strange. \n\nMe and my friend who went to a special needs school were involved in the speical needs sports, and we both had bad interactions with this boy with an unknown learning disability who did the same sports as us. Everyone thought it was sweet how he would try and play with the girls, but from our perspective, he was \"strange\" and he was basically trying to grope us and we didn't know the word grope. We didn't know what we were feeling was sexual harrassment. He would take too long to pass things over and elongate the length of time we were close by or touching, he would bump into us deliberately as if to knock us over, it felt like he was trying to find a way to land on us accidentally. All I could really explain was \"He doesn't play the game right, and he knocks into us and he takes too long to recieve the baton\" and all anyone heard was \"Disabled boy struggles playing game due to disability\". My friend got somewhere better when this boy grabbed her skirt and that was somehting she could put into words, but still no adult would say it was wrong to do that, just that maybe he was just reaching out to the first thing to keep his balance. He didn't do this to any of the other boys playing, btw. Just the girls. \n\nSo it's just something to keep in mind.

For her birthday, she wants to go swimming, so we rented the local community center that has a pool and a giant activity room where we\u2019ll have lots of treats and stuff. We asked her to make us a list of invitees so we can get everything coordinated. She asked if she could just invite her whole class of 20 or so kids. It\u2019s a big activity center with lots of room so we said that was fine.\n\nSo she goes to the kitchen and about ten minutes later comes back with her classmate \u201cdirectory.\u201d Her school puts together a small binder that lists the names of the students by each class, the names of the parent(s), and a phone number and/or email address. She hands it to me and I quickly notice that three names have been crossed out. I asked why, and she said those are the ones she doesn\u2019t want to invite. I started asking her other questions, like if they had an argument, or if they were mean, bullies, etc., and she maintained that no, she just thought they were strange and didn\u2019t really like them. I told her that she can\u2019t just invite the whole class with just three exclusions. She just kind of looked at me and said it\u2019s her birthday. I explained that this could be hurtful to them, and that if she was so staunchly against them attending, then it would be better to have a smaller party and invite just a handful of her closest friends. She said she doesn\u2019t want a small party, she wanted a big party, and I told her then everyone in the class is getting an invitation. She said no, they aren\u2019t, and I told her okay, then no one is and she ran out of the room crying. She has started crying and running away whenever she has seen me since and I\u2019m starting to feel guilty.\n\nMy wife was frustrated with me and says that she gets where I\u2019m coming from, but it IS daughter\u2019s birthday and she should only have the people she wants there. I tried to explain that I don\u2019t want our daughter to be a reason these three kids have a crappy time in school. I can\u2019t in good conscience let her exclude other kids like this.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Wife says all we need to worry about is daughter having a fun birthday and I\u2019m already ruining for picking a fight over something no one will remember years down the road, but I don\u2019t agree at all. If they were bullies, that would be one thing. But they aren\u2019t, so to me, it\u2019s cruelty. And cruelty sticks with people.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't think she needs to consider their feelings before her own, but it's also low stakes where these kids would probably hang out with the other kids in the class and she wouldn't have to pretend to like them.

It's a fine line to walk. NAH.", "This is a tough one, and I\u2019ve gone through a lot (not all) comments to see an issue not mentioned.

It\u2019s true that the other kids might not remember in a few years but for your daughter this goes beyond just a party. Think about the young women you want her to grow to be.

It's no more okay for a child at her 12 year old party than it is as an adult where you invite 12 out of 13 people from one department to something recreational (and don't mention it/don't invite the thirteenth person). If you plan a group event (and a party where you invite a class of 20 is a group event - not a party just for friends), it is only right to invite the full group - not go \"my friends in the group, my friends' friends in the group, the people I'm indifferent to in the group, and the people I kind of know in the group -- but ***not*** those 2 people in the group, THAT is a bridge too far\".\n\nShe wanted the big party. She wanted to invite (most of) the class. That means she invites all of the class. Being exclusionary this way is cruel and I hope you hold your ground here because this is a worthwhile life lesson for her.", "Spoiled lap sitting fur butt!", "That\u2019s a great suggestion! I will definitely ask about the interactions\u2014I know that sometimes kids don\u2019t tell the whole story to their parents for many reasons. Thanks for the feedback.", "Our school rule is \u201ceveryone, or less than half the class\u201d. I think that\u2019s reasonable to allow a kid to invite their friends without obviously excluding just a few children.", "I agree\u2026and OPs wife is so wrong about the remembering part \u2026those kids will absolutely remember this many years down the road.  That stuff sticks with you.  E.g Not a bullying thing but a left out thing\u2026I had a friend in middle school who wasn\u2019t picked  to be in the accelerated group for 8th grade.  It was really only the one year but it meant you got an extra year of Spanish and could skip 9th grade math and start with algebra. She remembered that for decades and it affected how she felt throughout HS and beyond.  So yes, these things stick with kids.", "I would also ask if the school/teacher has a rule about birthday invitations. Our first grade teachers (all of them) have the rule that if you aren\u2019t inviting the whole class, you can\u2019t invite more than 5 kids from the class. Obviously that\u2019s a difficult rule to maintain and follow through with, but so far it\u2019s been okay. My son\u2019s grade (closer to your daughter\u2019s age) does not have that rule, but if not everyone is invited, the teachers place the invitations in specific backpacks and discussion of the party is limited to recess/non-school times.", "You don\u2019t need to have issues to the point where a teacher is involved with someone to not want to be around them. When you were in school was a teacher involved everytime you and someone in class had a disagreement? Maybe she just finds them annoying or rude or something, why should she have to invite people she doesn\u2019t like. She isn\u2019t even singling out one person, that would feel more malicious but she just isn\u2019t inviting the handful of people she likely doesn\u2019t talk to", "Invite them all,not everyone will come anyway", "Probably overthinking this. It sounds like they are just three people she doesn't like. Not liking someone can just not be like someone. Maybe they're annoying. Weird. They don't like to share. They are a show off. They're great at stuff and the kid is jealous. \n\nI don't think this requires a deep dive investigation.", "Why all or nothing? Why do we force kid to invite people they don't want to their parties? Like adults aren't forced nor required to invite people they don't want to gathering they are having? Why do it to children?", "Absolutely NTA.  Just imagine the hurt those 3 kids would feel.", "NTA but from a practical matter it might be a losing battle.  If that\u2019s the case please *don\u2019t* use the school app/messaging to send the invites.  No kidding one of my sons friends just found she was the only one not invited to a birthday party because the parents used Class Dojo to send out the invites.  None of the other parents realized it was not an \u201ceveryone in the class\u201d situation so the parents of my son found out in a very awkward manner.  Please be discreet if that\u2019s the way it ends up going.", "Also, for what it's worth, I was the girl with undiagnosed ADHD that everyone thought was nice and smart but just... Weird. Not super weird, but just, kinda friends with everyone but also could never figure out why I wasn't always invited to most of the friend hangouts or why I was on the edge of a bunch of groups. \n\nI still remember my whole class talking about going to a girls bat mitzvah and realizing that I hadn't been invited but most everyone else had. That was middle school, I'm almost 30. Some of that stuff does hurt long term, especially when it's just that you aren't quite enough for some reason. Not mean, not harmful, just, different", "Fellow teacher and I agree.", "I agree. It is a tough situation. I dont think anyone is an AH here though whichever way it goes.\n\nFrom one side - yes its not nice to exclude a few people in the class. But on the other hand - thats life. Sometimes people dont like eachother... at 11 is kind of a good age to learn that. \n\nJust because someone doesn't want you around, doesn't mean that there is something wrong with you. Not every person gets along  - so those people should stay away from eachother instead of being forced to be polite and include them. Its more fun for everyone like that. I wouldn't want to be invited to something out of obligation at least....", "I would also recommend OP talking to the teacher(s) and getting more to the root of the issue either that way or through more conversation with his daughter. \n\nI think his wife is right though. There are valid reasons that she might not want those guests to attend and even if they aren't \"valid\" it is ultimately her party and her day. They can decide together as parents if it needs to be all or nothing but in my perspective, I'm also a teacher, I don't think everybody NEEDS to be invited. If everybody's not invited you are SO RIGHT though and OP PLEASE do the invites outside of school also if everybody isn't invited, it's important to do it in a kind, positive, and not personal way. In other words, kids should feel lucky they got invited instead of unlucky that they got disinvited. (Not inviting only three will definitely feel like the latter.) \n\nAs far as handling the politics of the invites goes, another option might be to invite more kids from other classes, maybe go up to 30 kids. And then instead of looking/feeling like, \"There are 20 kids in my class and I didn't invite three of them,\" it changes to feeling/looking more like, \"There are 60 kids in my grade level, and I had to pick the 30 that I'm closest to.\"  (Obviously the numbers could be changed to match the school setting.)", "> I personally do believe kids should be able to pick who they want and not be forced to invite the whole class.\n\nExcept **she\u2019s the one who asked if she could invite the whole class**.

You really think she's friends with 17 enough to warrant that?", "Great suggestion, might be more effective than just explaining that it could hurt their feelings, I should have worded like this instead. Will have this conversation soon.", "There is nothing wrong with not wanting certain kids at your party.", "THIS.  IF YOU DONT LIKE ME JUST  LEAVE ME TF ALONE.  I CAN ENTERTAIN MYSELF JUST FINE.", "See, I was ostracized as a kid, and I feel the opposite. Unless OP thinks his daughter is a bully who is going to be actively mean to the three kids, I would have wanted to be invited.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. I don\u2019t want a pity invite. I don\u2019t want to be somewhere I\u2019m not wanted.", "This is my thoughts as well. OP isn't going to be doing any favours by forcing her to invite the 'weird' kids. Those kids know they aren't close with op's kid and will likely figure they've been invited for pity reasons. Idk how the rest of the class feels about these kids, but if they see them the same way as op's kid, then they might just be excluded at the party by everyone else anyway.\nIt's a lose - lose situation for OP no matter what the choice, imo.", "Yeah, I kind of agree with this, I think. OP's intentions are good, but these kids are old enough to understand who they're really friends with and who they aren't. I might not be a great judge because as a kid, I just didn't care about this stuff either way, but I wouldn't want to be invited because the parents insisted. Kids can still be excluded even when invited.", "This!! I was an obligatory invite and tbh that stung worse than not being invited period. You can tell when you\u2019re not actually wanted somewhere but someone had to invite you.", "Yeah, this happened to my sister: parents got involved and forced the birthday girl to invite my sister, which made things worse for her. Nobody is excited to see the kid that caused their parents to get mad at them.", "Kids this age will already know, or start to realize they're the pitty invite. I was this kid and didn't realize it till much later. And when I did I felt horrible. Like I would have rather not been invited then be invited to be made fun of or ignored.", "In this case I'd disagree as it's a very obvious indication to the entire class (and other classes) that those three are outcasts. \n\nThe kids may also be somewhat oblivous. I was in a small extra-curricular group in elementary school and the entire team got invited to one of the kids for a celebratory party -except me. What made it worse is they invited an extra kid not on the team. I had happy memories otherwise but that really made me realise that they did not like me and honestly is still a bit of a rough memory to this day.", "Then they still can say, no, thank U. NTA", "That\u2019s actually really interesting, I\u2019ve never heard of that term. But I was thinking along the similar lines, there\u2019s definitely a difference between a gut feeling about someone and leaving them out to fit into a popular crowd or something", "I have heard of this phenomenon, but not the term.  I\u2019m not sure I would assume that is going on when I\u2019ve seen kids think others are strange simply because they are different (and not bad) and sometimes in really superficial ways.  I would definitely ask the kid why they are strange, though, as a follow up because that could mean all sorts of things.  But probably it just means they are poor or nerds or something.", "I think that's a very interesting call out. I will have to look into that a bit more to understand it.\n\nI am curious though, how would that be determined to be different to prejudices like racism, or other types of biases? I suspect there might be more to the situation that OP doesn't know yet that might be a factor.\n\nThere are plenty of learning opportunities in this situation for both aOp and the daughter it would seem.", "There\u2019s a difference between what you\u2019re describing and a twelve year old wanting to exclude a kid because they\u2019re wEiRd", "She's not walking down a dark alley. She's excluding the kids people hate (most likely for a disability if we're being realistic) for a 12 year old birthday party.", "Exactly, \u201cstrange\u201d could be anything from \u201cdoesn\u2019t watch the same tv shows as everyone else\u201d to \u201ctried coercing everyone at recess to make a blood sacrifice to the goblin that lives under the school and threatened to spill our secrets if we didn\u2019t\u201d but the latter might count as bullying so idk", "Yea, another commenter suggested that I ask the teacher about any interactions that have seemed off for further insight\u2014will be doing this for sure.

There is zero chance of his daughter not sharing the knowledge that she didn't want these three kids at the party....when talking about it to her friends she will undoubtedly say \"my dad is making me invite x, y and z, but I don't want them there\". This will get back to the kids in question, either before the party (and then they have the agonising feeling of not knowing if they should actually go) or during the party. \n\nPunishing his daughter for having preferences is also not great\n\nI'd say \"YTA\" for making it an all-or-nothing situation.

Is it only kids that are in a majority of her classes?

I made the other person more important. I said the whole \u201chow would you feel\u201d. But at the end of the day, I made her do something she felt wrong doing. The whole comment you made about women is so true. We are usually taught to put everyone else first.

It may be that she IS being bullied or feels uncomfortable around them for some reason and she was too embarrassed to tell you about it. It may be they have some behavioral or other issues. It could be these are the unpopular kids in her class and everyone leaves them out (which is why when she said she wanted to invite her entire class, she wasn't thinking of them.) It could be any number of things. But excluding those three students and inviting everyone else sends a strong message. She needs help understanding this. I can understand, from her perspective, feeling forced to invite people to her party whom she doesn't like.

I would never impose a \"less than half the class or everyone\" rule tbh, it would result in considering \"bullying\" so many situations that are 100% normal and reciprocated (it was normal that the boys invited just the boys+ those 2/3 girls they considered \"fun\").

Unfortunately, with kids being kids, I got picked on as well simply because I was his sister and therefore was ostracised. It didn't help that I'm ADHD and dealing with the kids' cruelty was hard and manifested in me trying very hard to fit in only to be shunted at almost every avenue. I couldn't even start Jr. High or High School with a fresh start. I was always known as \"So and so's sister.\"\n\nWhen I did get invited, at the age of 10/11/12, one of two things happened; I was made painfully aware before the party, or sometimes during, that I was not wanted there and was forced to endure the sneers and loneliness of sitting alone, or know everyone was going and then listened to how excited others were to be going and then how fun it was (whether or not it actually was) and purposely made to feel like crap. When the girl in 5th grade invited me to her party, she and her close friends made sure before hand to let me know she really didn't want me there but her parents made her invite me. I told my parents and my folks said I didn't have to go. I chose not to because I knew it would be awful.\n\nI will agree with the others who suggested to talk to the teacher before hand and let them know your concerns and see if this is a case of girls being catty or if there is something else making your daughter feel so staunchly against these three others attending. Who knows, maybe these three won't care anyway.\n\nI'm going to disagree with your wife and say that years later, you DO remember not being invited or having to choose to attend knowing you will be sorry for doing so later.

I wanted to invite most of the girls in my class, but I had to exclude a few girls because there was like X+2 or 3 girls in the class. I don't think my Mom realized this or she would have changed X. I actually can't remember how many girls I had to exclude, but I really think it was more than one, but I just remember being especially worried about one girl, we'll call her Lilly. Lilly was definitely \"popular\" for 4th grade, and she had some of the same friends, but she wasn't nice to me and had hurt my feelings by saying and doing mean things before. I felt bad for not inviting her, but I had the guest list amount, and she was mean sometimes, and I didn't think she'd find out anyway, because my Mom always taught me not to mention parties because it could hurt people's feelings, so I thought nobody would.\n\nWhelp, I think Lilly found out, because I really liked her best friend, Sam, who was really nice, and Sam didn't even RSVP. Also, on my actual birthday, Lilly was playing outside with a few other people, and I wanted to play too. I don't remember how this happened but she said \"Happy Birthday, now go away.\" when I tried to join I think was why. I suppose it's possible she was just being mean, because she was mean sometimes, but it really hurt my feelings, especially because it was my birthday.\n\nWhen I got older I realized I deserved it. Lilly was in my grade and some of my classes up until 12th grade, and I always felt terrible for not inviting her. And mad at her for saying that on birthday, but mostly bad.

However, your brain has been developed over millenia and, as such, has certain things hardwired into it. Things like the ability to sense danger is essential to survival and adaptive action, so your brain is necessarily good at recognizing those things even on a subconscious level. We actually have an entire area of our brains that are dedicated to only recognizing faces and decoding them. It's your posterior superior temporal sulcus and the neural pathways within it are specialized for recognizing movement in specific parts of the face.\n\nSmall things like micro facial expressions, body language, and tone are things that your brain is paying attention to at all times. It then takes that information and stores it for application to future interactions. It obviously also pays attention to verbal communication, but people can easily alter their words to present themselves a certain way. It's much more difficult to moderate your non-verbal communication. If you're presented with both verbal and nonverbal cues that are giving inconsistent conclusions, the nonverbal cues are more likely to be accurate, but less tangible, hence a \"gut feeling\". \n\nThin-slicing is essentially a subconscious behavior based on previous interactions and small snippets of experience that are applied to current situations.", "School systems vary a lot based on location, especially countries. 6th graders where I live still typically have one core class and one teacher they\u2019re with all day.", "You are correct here.

I thought she was one of the popular girls but she wasn\u2019t, she was just trying to survive too.\n\nETA - I went to a private school. I hated it there, I had one friend after 8 years there. I did have a ton of friends at the public school down the street but didn\u2019t have a say in where I went to school.", "My best friend invited everyone in our class but one girl to her Halloween birthday party. It's been a little over 25years and I still feel horrible for that girl. I didn't know until the party and boy she got an ear full but she didn't care.", "It sounds like someone is a bully, but it\u2019s not the three kids she wants to exclude.", "This. I was also the pity/required invite for at least two parties in elementary school, and the bullying I received in an environment with almost no adult supervision among my tormentors was far more damaging than being excluded would have been.", "That's why adults should supevise those parties and keep a close eye on what's going on.  \nThere's one girl in my daughter's class. She is enrolled officially in it, but doesn't going to school with the other kids, she has an individual learning course - I don't know, why.   \nShe's always invited to my daughter's parties.   \nIt takes a lot of \"work\" to have her included in their activities, but also find the balance and let her be alone, if she feels overwhelmed by the crowd and noise.  \n I noticed, that she willingly takes part in a \"structured\", foreseenable activities, like giving gifts (girls in my daughter's class made a whole play with it), \"treasure hunting\" for the goodie bags, structured plays etc. But she refuses, when the girls  ask her to play with them as a \"free playing\". So we don't push her, let her sit by the fireplace or go outside to the garden alone for a while.   \nBut all the time I keep eye on this particular girl, making sure she's ok. I can see, that the other girls are happy to have her included and try their best to ask her to join them. Sometimes she agrees, sometimes she doesn't.   \nBut it's an adult's work to see this all and help the kids.", "That was my life. The only thing worse than not getting invited was being the pity invite and getting treated like crap while at the party. The other kids always made sure to find ways to let you know you were not welcome or wanted at the party they were forced to invite you to.", "A good point. At least a few times in my school years I was at some kind of event for everyone, with a pool, and I'd just be nervous the whole time, especially as a small person who was easy to throw or push.", "Wtf. Dude I\u2019m 32 and if something really makes me upset I can tear right up too. It\u2019s called having feelings and emotions.", "Yeah \u201chey, little girl entering puberty, invite every boy from your class swimming, even the ones who say weird things that make you uncomfortable and you don\u2019t know why\u2026\u201d it\u2019s a dumb policy tbh", "I can't imagine why people are up voting someone opposed to rules of kindness.", "Those kids aren\u2019t gonna be quiet about the part before or after it", "Yep. And honestly I'd rather not be invited somewhere I'm not actually wanted. It isn't just singling out one kid. \n\nI suppose if I was really *that* concerned - I might ask her to pare it down a little more, like she can invited her top X choices or something? But no matter what, someone's gonna be upset. Those that aren't in the top X, the 3 that weren't invited or the 3 that are invited but then outcast at the party - nothing to say they get along with each other either.\n\nJust let the daughter invite who she wants - I agree it is her bday and she shouldn't be forced to invite people she doesn't like or suffer the consequence of inviting no one from the class. That also sends a not great message to her.\n\nBut I'd say don't do it by handing out the invites in class/at school. She can deal with any fall out herself, especially at that age. And I really can't imagine any parents piping up at that age. Well, maybe - since it's a different world since I was a kid or my daughter was that age.", "I was a kid invited to some parties out of pity. I didn\u2019t care. My mom had the rule that we invite everyone or no one, because I would be in shambles when I was the kid excluded from birthday parties for people who I thought I was very good friends with. So when I did get the pity invite, I knew it was because their parent were probably doing the same thing and I was just happy to be included.", "That's assuming that the kids want to go, being invited has an intent to be inclusive, and if these kids really don't get along with this girl they could say no, but choosing to exclude them and then all of the kids talking about it on Monday is hurtful and sticks with people. \n\nI remember a time I was invited by a girl that was mean to a recurring theater group, but it was all the girls and I went because heck I liked some of the people there, and I did get all of the shitty parts, including a bridge that was literally walked on. They also tried to frame me for wrecking some of her mom's stuff and prank called some of my guy friends, generally not a great time. Instead of remembering it as an embarrassing moment, I remember it as an empowering moment because I called my mom and went home. When the girl called me to apologize and invite me back, she overheard me tell my dad that I didn't want to go back and tried to make me feel guilty, but it was one of the first times I held my ground and learned how to do boundaries. \n\nSimilarly, there was a girl that had a bat mitzvah that invited basically the entire class but me a few years later on, different school different kids, and how everybody talked about how cool it was and asked me what I thought of it and then I realized that I was one of the only people that wasn't invited, especially when she started shushing people talking about it around me. It was intentional, and that hurt. Honestly that girl and I weren't very close and if she invited me I would have maybe said no, but realizing everyone was invited but me and people that I was friends with wanted me there, that hurt. I'm probably more than twice that age now and still remember the moment like it's a movie scene in my head. I wasn't a bully or a mean kid, I was the smart kid with ADHD that everyone thought was nice but was just sometimes too much, probably. \n\nThe point is, these kids are old enough to start having boundaries and navigating situations themselves, but being excluded is something that they will remember, having a shitty time is not something that the dad that is not their dad should shield them from, but something that they can navigate and grow from. And considering we don't know this full story, she could be using a dumb reason like she heard a rumor or they did better on a test or something crappy because that's what kids do.", "If they feel like that, they won't come.  But there wouldn't be weird feelings if the whole class were invited.  \n\nEither have a small party with close friends or invite everyone.  My daughter was once the only girl in her class not invited to a party because the birthday girl's bf had an axe to grind and convinced the girl not to invite my daughter.  It only bothered her because everyone else was invited.  Had it just been a few people, she would not have cared.", "Then it would be the daughter leading the bullying. And that is unacceptable.", "i was one of those kids often left out of shit. i was always excited to be invited to a party. it didn\u2019t happen often, but i remember the ones fondly that i did get to go to.\n\nmy classmates weren\u2019t actively mean, but they  more pretended i wasn\u2019t there.\n\nmy adhd among other things was pretty bad in elementary school and my interests weren\u2019t shared by any of the girls", "Yes it\u2019d be best if he can talk to her in a way that\u2019ll enable her to empathize. Great learning opportunity for the daughter!", "Right? Plus who says they\u2019d even *want* to attend? If they\u2019re not friends, why would they want to go?", "It\u2019s better to be invited because mom or dad made them (which is under duress, not out of pity). I\u2019ve been on both sides. Getting the invite is way better than not.", "They\u2019re almost teens, not children, and are ready to learn the realities of life. Sometimes you\u2019re not included, it sucks, but we make different friends and we move on.", "Finally, someone with some reason, rather than thinking about themselves and their past history and interjecting it into an 11 year old's birthday party.", "And kids will talk about it because they will assume everyone was invited and that the ones who were absent couldn't make it.", "On the other hand, if you do get invited, what 'fun' is it to just be the one kid that's ignored?", "Maybe. But whether that\u2019s a reason not to go should be up to the guest to decide.", "reddit is crazy pills. to be fair, OP thought he needed to come to reddit for advice so he might be a little off himself", "I think you're taking sane pills. A smaller party with close friends is the way. That way it gets to be her special day...but not her special day to reap additional social status benefits at someone else's cost. Because that's what the bigger party is about, it's about status, same reason she doesn't want the weird kids there. So cut out the status game altogther and make it about celebrating her day with her real friends.", "It's not playing god - it's parenting. He's trying to give his daughter the message not to be a heartless jerk for no reason. The 'popular' kids always decide who is 'in' or 'out' (wrong shoes? Out.) and all the other kids play along with it. He's trying to teach his daughter empathy, and his idea of small party vs everybody party is a good one.", "I said something similar \u2014 I was ostracized in school myself and while I appreciate the sentiment, sometimes the \u201cweird\u201d kids aren\u2019t just awkward like I was \u2014 they are unkind, inappropriate (especially in middle school\u2026), and potentially going to be a problem at the party.", "THANK YOU.  I understand wanting to teach kids empathy and fairness, and it's an important lesson.  But it's just as important to teach kids to look at the *quality* of their friendships and the people they choose to associate with.  I remember being that age and being literally sexually harassed by boys in my grade that were just entering that boundary-pushing/puberty-discovering age.  Can you imagine forcing your daughter to associate with people who make her feel uncomfortable in ways she may not even be able to articulate yet?", "Right? She's 11 for goodness sake. People here act as though she's some criminal mastermind hell bent on ruining the lives of innocents when she's literally a primary school kid who wants to have the people she likes at her party.\n\n\nAnd the swimwear part is so true. I've had boys in my  class who are creepy and weird towards girls, and I'd rather cancel my party than invite them where I'm wearing a swimsuit if I were the daughter. Sometimes people are just uncomfortable around certain people.", "Absolutely. OP is totally disregarding his daughters feelings. She shouldn\u2019t invite people she doesn\u2019t want to just to make them feel better. What about her feelings?

Top comment is a bunch of people calling a pre-teen manipulative for being upset and crying because her party is being cancelled. I fully agree with you here though these comments coming after an 11 year old and therapising her are absolutely vile and what's worse is OP seems to not defend their kid at any point.

Not hard. I don't ever remember anyone handing out party invites IN my classes. Granted, I wasn't invited to many, but any one I did get came in the mail. It's not rocket science.", "Also, what if those kids show up to her party because they're invited, and the other kids are mean to them? Sure, the adults can intervene, but the adults can't make them be friends. Those kids probably already feel like outcasts and likely wouldn't want to spend their time off school with their bullies. \n\nMy mom would have dragged me to a party if I were invited, not listening to me saying I hate those kids. \n\nI dunno, I think it's fine to not invite them. But I could also be biased.", "Agreed. Unless there is a DARN good reason, we always accepted bday invitations. I'll never forget when my daughter was the only one in her class that showed up.

The school literally begged my mom to put me up a grade because at bare min, I had friends there, that\u2019s how bad it got (also, was *incredibly* bored).  Of course, by the time I was in school, there were policies in place about exclusions, and for the most part the parents bought in to that.  Parties were *awful.* It was made clear time and again my invite was an obligation, not a want, and the exclusion was honestly 10x worse, because it was a more active exclusion.\n\nI just feel like there\u2019s no 100% good choice here, at least until more info is gotten from teachers and maybe the other kids\u2019 parents.  As much as the parents will try to keep an eye on everyone, a large group of kids in a big area can accomplish a lot.  If it\u2019s a class wide issue, just making the daughter invite them can throw a lot of fuel on the fire.  At the same time, I feel like having a smaller party could just cause the daughter to blame the other students, the same for canceling a celebration altogether. \n\nI really think touching base with the other parents and teacher and coming up with a game plan that works for all the kids is the best route.  Maybe they know an obligation invite wouldn\u2019t be the best choice, so they decide to do something else as a group instead (if the kids are friends that is), while daughter gives out invites outside of class.  Maybe it\u2019s the parents come with so there\u2019s extra eyes in case something happens.  Maybe it is simply daughter has a smaller party and teach keeps an extra eye out for any potential retaliation.

Yes, we're just managing to teach girls their boundaries should be respected, but this doesn't mean they can just skip kindness. I don't expect my daughter to date every boy that ever asks her out, but I will absolutely protest if she does something like publically humiliate him for funzies. We shouldn't make our kids responsible for fixing anyone's life, but we can ask they don't contribute to their misery. Her party will be huge, she won't even have to interact with these people.

It will force her to find the words to describe her issue with them. Some girls just don\u2019t gel together and that\u2019s alright, but it\u2019s either a select group or everyone at this party and she\u2019ll have to decide whether it\u2019s worth excluding them and having a smaller party or invite everyone and make sure no one is a snot to the three girls she didn\u2019t want to invite.\n\nAnd destroy the paper afterwards, just in case.

We did it for our daughter. And again for our son. It was way cheaper than a pizza place or trampoline place. Even with paying the lifeguards. And we didn't have a big enough place for their entire classes. And that is who got invited! Everyone in their class! Some years we would rent a pavillion at a park for the same reason...room for everyone! There were years, especially in middle school, when they had sleepover parties with just a few friends.

In turn my parents got me a tutor who couldn't explain why I couldn't perform at school. So their bullying also cut into my free time. But now I should just forgive them? Fuck that.", "Haha awesome!

I'm younger, but as someone who grew up in a really, really bad home environment with drugs and stuff at home, I often got called the \"dirty\" kid and the \"poor\" kid and everyone hated me. I'll never, ever forget the things that were said and done to me back then. I have Borderline now from the way I grew up, and who knows if that would have been different if kids didn't hate me so much and parents didn't make sure their kids didn't hang out with me because I was \"that kid\" that lived at \"that house\".", "Yeah, I spent 34 years wondering what was wrong with me and then I found out. There is nothing wrong with me, I am just autistic and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine as I am.

I was just different and that was enough. I am 36 now and I have decided that it was something wrong with them, I never did anything wrong, they did by how they treated me and even more so all the adults that allowed it. I could never have been excluded the way that I was unless the adults allowed and enabled it. \n\nWhen I was 16 it happened again, we had a project in one class and the teacher divided us up in groups. My group mates walked up to the teacher, right in front of me, and loudly told him that they didn\u2019t want to work with me because I would lower their grade. I thought I knew what the teacher would say but I didn\u2019t. He looked at me and guess he saw it in my eyes, all the hurt form all the times before because he told them that he had a very hard time seeing how I could possibly lower *their* grade, considering I had  a much higher grade than both of them. First time I wasn\u2019t left feeling humiliated and small and unwanted. He then asked me if I wanted to work with them or if I wanted to do it on my own, on my own, and he said sure he knew I could do it. Then he started to talk to them about how much harder it would be to do it on their own, without me, but he still expected the same work\u2026 and I left.", "so many of us \"weird kids\" had (& still have!) adhd or were in some way neurodivergent. luckily at a youngish age i found a group of people who accepted me in all my adhd-ness, but before that there was bullying by other kids. and there are so many ND people who don't find a support system to help bolster and protect them when young. we always remember the times we were left out for not being \"normal\".", "Yep. Spent my whole life wondering why other people left me out of things and called me weird. Until age 30, when I got my autism diagnosis. Makes sense now.", "Probably means the kids are ND and just do things differently than what's \"normal.\" Kids have a hard time understanding when other kids don't act like them, but as parents we need to explain that everyone is different and different doesn't equal bad.

Suddenly I don't feel quite so alone", "Thanks! Some days I\u2019m looking up whether it\u2019s too late for boarding school, but I remember what I was like at that age and say a silent apology to my father.

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD but we are still very close to certain I am on the spectrum. \nI am a 46 year old female, who experienced all of the things you spoke of above, to the very exclusion of group work  as a group because I was the weird one.\nHowever, later in my teens and my school journey I had the opposite start to happen where I was in higher credit, much harder school courses.\nThose courses funny enough were filled with other students who were very much like me. We formed enough of a bond in these classes that we would choose each other in other classes filled with the meaner students.\nThis pissed the other students off royally. Because we were winning the contests, screwing up the curve, and we refused to join their groups because we were tired of being taken advantage of, being forced to do the work while others slacked.\nIt was the later support from those bonds with us \"weird\" kids that made the latter part of school bearable.\nBlessings fellow weirdo \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude04"]}
