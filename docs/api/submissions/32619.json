For her birthday, she wants to go swimming, so we rented the local community center that has a pool and a giant activity room where we\u2019ll have lots of treats and stuff. We asked her to make us a list of invitees so we can get everything coordinated. She asked if she could just invite her whole class of 20 or so kids. It\u2019s a big activity center with lots of room so we said that was fine.\n\nSo she goes to the kitchen and about ten minutes later comes back with her classmate \u201cdirectory.\u201d Her school puts together a small binder that lists the names of the students by each class, the names of the parent(s), and a phone number and/or email address. She hands it to me and I quickly notice that three names have been crossed out. I asked why, and she said those are the ones she doesn\u2019t want to invite. I started asking her other questions, like if they had an argument, or if they were mean, bullies, etc., and she maintained that no, she just thought they were strange and didn\u2019t really like them. I told her that she can\u2019t just invite the whole class with just three exclusions. She just kind of looked at me and said it\u2019s her birthday. I explained that this could be hurtful to them, and that if she was so staunchly against them attending, then it would be better to have a smaller party and invite just a handful of her closest friends. She said she doesn\u2019t want a small party, she wanted a big party, and I told her then everyone in the class is getting an invitation. She said no, they aren\u2019t, and I told her okay, then no one is and she ran out of the room crying. She has started crying and running away whenever she has seen me since and I\u2019m starting to feel guilty.\n\nMy wife was frustrated with me and says that she gets where I\u2019m coming from, but it IS daughter\u2019s birthday and she should only have the people she wants there. I tried to explain that I don\u2019t want our daughter to be a reason these three kids have a crappy time in school. I can\u2019t in good conscience let her exclude other kids like this.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Wife says all we need to worry about is daughter having a fun birthday and I\u2019m already ruining for picking a fight over something no one will remember years down the road, but I don\u2019t agree at all. If they were bullies, that would be one thing. But they aren\u2019t, so to me, it\u2019s cruelty.

As a teacher, I personally do believe kids should be able to pick who they want and not be forced to invite the whole class. This is a special day for them, and in the real world you DONT include everyone, as much as it sucks.\n\nHowever, inviting such a large percentage and then leaving out just 3 is really rough. Any way to edit things a bit, does she mostly have girlfriends and the 3 are guys so maybe leave out all of the guys and make it an all girl party?? \n\nI feel like in a class of 20, maybe leaving 7ish off is okay, but when you start getting down the the smaller numbers it\u2019ll hit those kids hard.\n\nWhatever you do, send the invites outside of school if not everyone is invited. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d suggest you talk to the teacher. Your daughter may not want to share the real issue.\n\nNAH", "NTA. Kudos for teaching her right vs. wrong. Maybe turn it around and ask her how she would feel if she was one of three excluded from a classmate\u2019s birthday party.", "I can understand your point. However, speaking as someone who was ostracized as a kid, I can tell you that I would rather NOT be invited as opposed to being invited out of \u201cobligation.\u201d You\u2019re not doing the uninvited kids any favors, because it will be painfully obvious that they really aren\u2019t welcome.", "I can't say you're the A here because you have good intentions and want to take this opportunity and teach your daughter a lesson of kindness. \n\nThat being said... 11-12 yo is a weird age when you start to tell your friends more than you tell your parents, so it could end up being worse to force your child to invite those three kids because she's going to tell her friends at school that she was made to invite them in order to have her party, it could already be too late in that regard if she already vented to her friends about you \"being unfair\".  \n\n\"They are strange\" could mean A LOT of things at 11-12 yo: lack of common interest, minor bullying incidents, rudeness, ADHD, conflicting personalities, lack of personal awareness, general bad hygiene, gender segregation, general early pre-teen pettiness or maybe the don't attend class much and she doesn't really know them. I suggest contacting the teacher to get a general idea of the interactions your daughter has with those kids to get to root of her reluctance to invite them.", "I don't know that I feel comfortable calling you an asshole for this because, ultimately, your heart is in a good place.\n\nIt does suck to feel excluded, and when it's only 3 people they are probably going to feel that way. On the other hand, our brains do this thing called thin-slicing. You ever have a feeling that someone is just...off? And they haven't really overtly done anything to you to make you feel that way but there's this nagging feeling that something isn't quite right? That's an example of thin-slicing. It's basically your brain's ability to make a judgement based off of very limited interaction or information. Sometimes it can be biased but, overall, it's pretty accurate. I would caution against teaching your daughter to ignore her gut instinct, if that is in fact what's happening. She simply may not have the language or knowledge to articulate to you the reasons why she feels the way she does. That doesn't necessarily make her wrong. And teaching her to ignore those signals could ultimately put her is a dangerous position someday.\n\nI think there's NAH and you should delve a little deeper into this conversation with your wife and then your daughter.", "Tricky. As there is still some time, try to figure out, why your daughter doesn't want them to be at her birthday party. \"Strange\" is actually not a really satisfying answer. Perhaps there has been a situation at school or something else.  \nI agree with you: Every child should be included. The problem is, if your child starts to exclude them, other children might follow that idea. And suddenly your child is the \"bully\".  \nYour wife is somehow right as well when she says that it's your daughter's birthday. However, your daughter is 11/12 years old and children at that age are just mean sometimes.  \nTo me, NTA.", "YTA - I know this might be controversial but I was a kid \"not long ago\" and I was friends with most people in my class but there were definitely kids that I didn't like/didn't get along with that I didn't want in my birthday party and I've always thought it was unfair that I had to invite everyone... My mom had the same opinion as you, everyone should be invited and I shouldn't leave anyone out, but at the end of the day it's their party and it will just be uncomfortable for the guests because they will know they are not wanted - trust me, kids are ruthless and will go above and beyond if they are unhappy with the situation. I think you're just gonna end up making your kid unhappy and the other 3 kids as well - will your daughter and her friends actually include them in the activities or will they just show up to the party and be left out by everyone for a couple hours? Which scenario is best?\n\nIf they were toddlers I'd understand, kids that young are friends with grass if need be, but they are at the age to have people that they like and dislike.", "YTA. I\u2019m so sick of this idea of every single person needing to be included in every single thing. It\u2019s a birthday party for your child. Your child should get to choose who she invites.

Not everything has to be fair to everybody all the time", "This is a tough one, but I am going to say YTA. I understand wanting to teach your daughter to be kind and inclusive, but not at the expense of her own feelings or comfortable. Women are taught from young age that we have to be nice and considerate of other peoples feelings sometime at the expense of our own. I understand what you are trying to do but you are also telling your daughter she can't celebrate her birthday with the people she wants to because it would be rude to the kids that aren't invited. You are telling her she has to make her celebration about including other people.", "yta. at that age she\u2019s old enough to invite who she wants to", "YTA. I was the kid in class that had to be forced to be around the weird kids. I was partnered with them and told that I was helping them. I fucking hated it. \n\nI'm not saying your daughter is forced to do this. But I totally get why she doesn't want them at HER party. \n\nWhen she's a teenager and she throws a birthday party, are you still going to force her to invite people she doesn't like? Because to me you're teaching your daughter that other people's feelings matter more than hers. Do you think other kids who possibly don't like your daughter will invite her? And if that does happen, what are you going to tell her? \n\nYour kids feelings should matter more to you than strangers you don't know.", "I want to comment on this as a teacher: very few things will make me despise and think I'll of you as a person, parent and thinking creature than allowing your kid to do this shit to a classmate. \n\nOne of my students last year invited 8 out of 10 boys to his birthday party, and the parents didn't understand how that was shitty, since it was their precious baby's birthday.\n\nDon't be a shitty parent.

A good rule of thumb is either the whole class or less than half.", "Eh\u2026.If she\u2019s allowed to have a small birthday and pick the guest list, why can\u2019t she have the same guest list at the big party? If she was 5 or 6 I\u2019d understand this sentiment, but at 12 kids start to figure out who they are and they\u2019re not all going to be friends. Learning that you\u2019re not going to be invited to everything is a part of life, and it sounds like SHE wouldn\u2019t be too bummed if those 3 kids didn\u2019t invite her to their parties. Let her have her party with the friends she chooses. As an adult, you certainly wouldn\u2019t invite people you didn\u2019t particularly care for\u2026why make her?\n\nEdit to add: I\u2019d also take into account that she might not be telling you why she doesn\u2019t want those particular children there.", "YTA - everyone can\u2019t be invited to everything. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be forced to invite people she\u2019s not comfortable with to her birthday party. She\u2019s old enough to decide who she wants to spend time with.

I get where you\u2019re coming from but it\u2019s her birthday, and if she doesn\u2019t like them she doesn\u2019t have to invite them. It could be detrimental to her when she grows up making her think that she has to \u2018like\u2019 people she doesn\u2019t like. If they make her uncomfortable in a way maybe that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want them there but you\u2019re forcing it on her before threatening to cancel the party entirely. Also, for the \u201ccruelty sticks with people\u201d thing, the same could be said for your daughter if you force her to invite said children.", "NTA. Think of how bad those three little kids would feel when all of the others are talking about what a great time they had at the birthday party. You gave her the option of having a smaller party, but she refused. I think you're handling this right and your wife needs to support you 100% on this.", "NTA. If your wife lets your daughter exclude three kids for just being weird, they\u2019d both be bullies. It seems you want your daughter to be better than that.", "No, definitely NTA. It would be one thing if she wasn\u2019t inviting the major majority of the class but to just exclude three kids she thinks are weird? That\u2019s not ok. I honestly feel like a lot of schools require if you\u2019re inviting that many that you have to invite the whole class. \n\nI see how your wife does say well it is her birthday and if she doesn\u2019t want them but this is also a great time to teach acceptance if she insists on inviting the whole class. But, I do feel like you are correct in a smaller party or the whole class.

Please don\u2019t. I had a reason and never told anyone when I was turning 12. A friend and I had a strange relationship and it was never publicly known.

You're not wrong for caring about everyone's feelings, but balancing this with your daughter's happiness on her special day is key.", "Most schools near me require ALL Students to be invited if handed out in school bc of this very reason. It would be one thing if she was only inviting the girls or half the class but all but 3? That\u2019s bordering on bully behavior.

Thank you for looking out for the underdogs.", "While I get that you're trying to do the right thing, forcing her to invite everyone will probably just make it worse. These aren't toddlers, they're old enough to understand when other kids don't like them and they will probably realize she only invited them because you forced her to. That can be more hurtful than just being left out, because you're basically getting a \"pity invite\" and it makes other kids see you as a baby or someone who needs the adults to give them special treatment.

But by the age of 11/12, there are definite risks to associating yourself with the strange kids in class and most people stop doing the \"everyone is invited\" parties at much younger ages.\n\nWhile the class outcasts may not have done anything to make your child not want them at their party, they could have a very valid fear that if they invite them, then the bullies in the class will group your child with the weirdos and they will start being bullied.\n\nAnd don't forget that there is always the chance that your child is already friends with the bullies who make fun of the weirdos and knows that inviting them would cause her own friends to shun her.\n\nThey say that where boys use physical violence to vie for social positon, girls use psychological methods. If you force her to do something she doesn't want to do, it is likely because she knows it will mess up her social hierarchy, and you can't underestimate how important that is to teenagers, not just in their imaginations, but in the ramifications for how her peers treat her now and through highschool.\n\nTry to get her to explain what she fears will happen if you force her to invite the outcasts.

At 12 those other kids have more than enough potential to be terrible shit heads if not complete creeps.

In the future when she is excluded from some event, and doesn't understand why its ok for them to do it, but not for her, what will you do then? Socialization is a learned skill from both negative and positive feedback, if you try to subdue the negativity all that is going to create is individuals with and unearned sense of entitlement.I understand the values you are trying to instill. However, there are other ways to go about it. We all discriminate to a certain degree, and as she grows up, she'll do it more and more.

It\u2019s the same here, someone doesn\u2019t need to be a bully or start an argument with you for you to not like them, maybe they\u2019re rude, like to annoy her, tease her, rub her the wrong way or just creep her out but she\u2019s 11 so she can\u2019t articulate this so just called them strange. \n\nAt the end of the day she\u2019s 11, not a little kid, most 11 year olds wouldn\u2019t be hurt if a random kid in their class that they aren\u2019t friends with doesn\u2019t invite them to their party. And if they are alittle hurt that sucks but it sucks even more to not be in control of the guestlist for your own party because you don\u2019t like 3 people in class, what makes you think these kids even want to come? If your daughter doesn\u2019t like them there\u2019s a good chance the feeling is mutual", "I get what you\u2019re trying to do and it doesn\u2019t seem bad.

Then your daughter needs to understand that harmless \"strange\" behaviour is not something you exclude someone over. However sometimes strange is an age appropriate way of explaining \"makes me feel uncomfortable in a way I can't explain\". And that is something to allow some discretion over. Maybe that's why she's crying. \n\nOf course she could just be being mean herself and crying to make you feel bad but that's what I mean when I say, you need to get to the bottom of what she means by strange. \n\nMe and my friend who went to a special needs school were involved in the speical needs sports, and we both had bad interactions with this boy with an unknown learning disability who did the same sports as us. Everyone thought it was sweet how he would try and play with the girls, but from our perspective, he was \"strange\" and he was basically trying to grope us and we didn't know the word grope. We didn't know what we were feeling was sexual harrassment. He would take too long to pass things over and elongate the length of time we were close by or touching, he would bump into us deliberately as if to knock us over, it felt like he was trying to find a way to land on us accidentally. All I could really explain was \"He doesn't play the game right, and he knocks into us and he takes too long to recieve the baton\" and all anyone heard was \"Disabled boy struggles playing game due to disability\". My friend got somewhere better when this boy grabbed her skirt and that was somehting she could put into words, but still no adult would say it was wrong to do that, just that maybe he was just reaching out to the first thing to keep his balance. He didn't do this to any of the other boys playing, btw. Just the girls. \n\nSo it's just something to keep in mind.

For her birthday, she wants to go swimming, so we rented the local community center that has a pool and a giant activity room where we\u2019ll have lots of treats and stuff. We asked her to make us a list of invitees so we can get everything coordinated. She asked if she could just invite her whole class of 20 or so kids. It\u2019s a big activity center with lots of room so we said that was fine.\n\nSo she goes to the kitchen and about ten minutes later comes back with her classmate \u201cdirectory.\u201d Her school puts together a small binder that lists the names of the students by each class, the names of the parent(s), and a phone number and/or email address. She hands it to me and I quickly notice that three names have been crossed out. I asked why, and she said those are the ones she doesn\u2019t want to invite. I started asking her other questions, like if they had an argument, or if they were mean, bullies, etc., and she maintained that no, she just thought they were strange and didn\u2019t really like them. I told her that she can\u2019t just invite the whole class with just three exclusions. She just kind of looked at me and said it\u2019s her birthday. I explained that this could be hurtful to them, and that if she was so staunchly against them attending, then it would be better to have a smaller party and invite just a handful of her closest friends. She said she doesn\u2019t want a small party, she wanted a big party, and I told her then everyone in the class is getting an invitation. She said no, they aren\u2019t, and I told her okay, then no one is and she ran out of the room crying. She has started crying and running away whenever she has seen me since and I\u2019m starting to feel guilty.\n\nMy wife was frustrated with me and says that she gets where I\u2019m coming from, but it IS daughter\u2019s birthday and she should only have the people she wants there. I tried to explain that I don\u2019t want our daughter to be a reason these three kids have a crappy time in school. I can\u2019t in good conscience let her exclude other kids like this.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Wife says all we need to worry about is daughter having a fun birthday and I\u2019m already ruining for picking a fight over something no one will remember years down the road, but I don\u2019t agree at all. If they were bullies, that would be one thing. But they aren\u2019t, so to me, it\u2019s cruelty. And cruelty sticks with people.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't think she needs to consider their feelings before her own, but it's also low stakes where these kids would probably hang out with the other kids in the class and she wouldn't have to pretend to like them.

It's a fine line to walk. NAH.", "This is a tough one, and I\u2019ve gone through a lot (not all) comments to see an issue not mentioned.

It\u2019s true that the other kids might not remember in a few years but for your daughter this goes beyond just a party. Think about the young women you want her to grow to be.

It's no more okay for a child at her 12 year old party than it is as an adult where you invite 12 out of 13 people from one department to something recreational (and don't mention it/don't invite the thirteenth person). If you plan a group event (and a party where you invite a class of 20 is a group event - not a party just for friends), it is only right to invite the full group - not go \"my friends in the group, my friends' friends in the group, the people I'm indifferent to in the group, and the people I kind of know in the group -- but ***not*** those 2 people in the group, THAT is a bridge too far\".\n\nShe wanted the big party. She wanted to invite (most of) the class. That means she invites all of the class. Being exclusionary this way is cruel and I hope you hold your ground here because this is a worthwhile life lesson for her.", "Spoiled lap sitting fur butt!", "That\u2019s a great suggestion! I will definitely ask about the interactions\u2014I know that sometimes kids don\u2019t tell the whole story to their parents for many reasons. Thanks for the feedback.", "Our school rule is \u201ceveryone, or less than half the class\u201d. I think that\u2019s reasonable to allow a kid to invite their friends without obviously excluding just a few children.", "I agree\u2026and OPs wife is so wrong about the remembering part \u2026those kids will absolutely remember this many years down the road.  That stuff sticks with you.  E.g Not a bullying thing but a left out thing\u2026I had a friend in middle school who wasn\u2019t picked  to be in the accelerated group for 8th grade.  It was really only the one year but it meant you got an extra year of Spanish and could skip 9th grade math and start with algebra. She remembered that for decades and it affected how she felt throughout HS and beyond.  So yes, these things stick with kids.", "I would also ask if the school/teacher has a rule about birthday invitations. Our first grade teachers (all of them) have the rule that if you aren\u2019t inviting the whole class, you can\u2019t invite more than 5 kids from the class. Obviously that\u2019s a difficult rule to maintain and follow through with, but so far it\u2019s been okay. My son\u2019s grade (closer to your daughter\u2019s age) does not have that rule, but if not everyone is invited, the teachers place the invitations in specific backpacks and discussion of the party is limited to recess/non-school times.", "You don\u2019t need to have issues to the point where a teacher is involved with someone to not want to be around them. When you were in school was a teacher involved everytime you and someone in class had a disagreement? Maybe she just finds them annoying or rude or something, why should she have to invite people she doesn\u2019t like. She isn\u2019t even singling out one person, that would feel more malicious but she just isn\u2019t inviting the handful of people she likely doesn\u2019t talk to", "Invite them all,not everyone will come anyway", "Probably overthinking this. It sounds like they are just three people she doesn't like. Not liking someone can just not be like someone. Maybe they're annoying. Weird. They don't like to share. They are a show off. They're great at stuff and the kid is jealous. \n\nI don't think this requires a deep dive investigation.", "Why all or nothing? Why do we force kid to invite people they don't want to their parties? Like adults aren't forced nor required to invite people they don't want to gathering they are having? Why do it to children?", "Absolutely NTA.  Just imagine the hurt those 3 kids would feel.", "NTA but from a practical matter it might be a losing battle.  If that\u2019s the case please *don\u2019t* use the school app/messaging to send the invites.  No kidding one of my sons friends just found she was the only one not invited to a birthday party because the parents used Class Dojo to send out the invites.  None of the other parents realized it was not an \u201ceveryone in the class\u201d situation so the parents of my son found out in a very awkward manner.  Please be discreet if that\u2019s the way it ends up going.", "Also, for what it's worth, I was the girl with undiagnosed ADHD that everyone thought was nice and smart but just... Weird. Not super weird, but just, kinda friends with everyone but also could never figure out why I wasn't always invited to most of the friend hangouts or why I was on the edge of a bunch of groups. \n\nI still remember my whole class talking about going to a girls bat mitzvah and realizing that I hadn't been invited but most everyone else had. That was middle school, I'm almost 30. Some of that stuff does hurt long term, especially when it's just that you aren't quite enough for some reason. Not mean, not harmful, just, different", "Fellow teacher and I agree.", "I agree. It is a tough situation. I dont think anyone is an AH here though whichever way it goes.\n\nFrom one side - yes its not nice to exclude a few people in the class. But on the other hand - thats life. Sometimes people dont like eachother... at 11 is kind of a good age to learn that. \n\nJust because someone doesn't want you around, doesn't mean that there is something wrong with you. Not every person gets along  - so those people should stay away from eachother instead of being forced to be polite and include them. Its more fun for everyone like that. I wouldn't want to be invited to something out of obligation at least....", "I would also recommend OP talking to the teacher(s) and getting more to the root of the issue either that way or through more conversation with his daughter. \n\nI think his wife is right though. There are valid reasons that she might not want those guests to attend and even if they aren't \"valid\" it is ultimately her party and her day. They can decide together as parents if it needs to be all or nothing but in my perspective, I'm also a teacher, I don't think everybody NEEDS to be invited. If everybody's not invited you are SO RIGHT though and OP PLEASE do the invites outside of school also if everybody isn't invited, it's important to do it in a kind, positive, and not personal way. In other words, kids should feel lucky they got invited instead of unlucky that they got disinvited. (Not inviting only three will definitely feel like the latter.) \n\nAs far as handling the politics of the invites goes, another option might be to invite more kids from other classes, maybe go up to 30 kids. And then instead of looking/feeling like, \"There are 20 kids in my class and I didn't invite three of them,\" it changes to feeling/looking more like, \"There are 60 kids in my grade level, and I had to pick the 30 that I'm closest to.\"  (Obviously the numbers could be changed to match the school setting.)", "> I personally do believe kids should be able to pick who they want and not be forced to invite the whole class.\n\nExcept **she\u2019s the one who asked if she could invite the whole class**.

You really think she's friends with 17 enough to warrant that?", "Great suggestion, might be more effective than just explaining that it could hurt their feelings, I should have worded like this instead. Will have this conversation soon.", "There is nothing wrong with not wanting certain kids at your party.", "THIS.  IF YOU DONT LIKE ME JUST  LEAVE ME TF ALONE.  I CAN ENTERTAIN MYSELF JUST FINE.", "See, I was ostracized as a kid, and I feel the opposite. Unless OP thinks his daughter is a bully who is going to be actively mean to the three kids, I would have wanted to be invited.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. I don\u2019t want a pity invite. I don\u2019t want to be somewhere I\u2019m not wanted.", "This is my thoughts as well. OP isn't going to be doing any favours by forcing her to invite the 'weird' kids. Those kids know they aren't close with op's kid and will likely figure they've been invited for pity reasons. Idk how the rest of the class feels about these kids, but if they see them the same way as op's kid, then they might just be excluded at the party by everyone else anyway.\nIt's a lose - lose situation for OP no matter what the choice, imo.", "Yeah, I kind of agree with this, I think. OP's intentions are good, but these kids are old enough to understand who they're really friends with and who they aren't. I might not be a great judge because as a kid, I just didn't care about this stuff either way, but I wouldn't want to be invited because the parents insisted. Kids can still be excluded even when invited.", "This!! I was an obligatory invite and tbh that stung worse than not being invited period. You can tell when you\u2019re not actually wanted somewhere but someone had to invite you.", "Yeah, this happened to my sister: parents got involved and forced the birthday girl to invite my sister, which made things worse for her. Nobody is excited to see the kid that caused their parents to get mad at them.", "Kids this age will already know, or start to realize they're the pitty invite. I was this kid and didn't realize it till much later. And when I did I felt horrible. Like I would have rather not been invited then be invited to be made fun of or ignored.", "In this case I'd disagree as it's a very obvious indication to the entire class (and other classes) that those three are outcasts. \n\nThe kids may also be somewhat oblivous. I was in a small extra-curricular group in elementary school and the entire team got invited to one of the kids for a celebratory party -except me. What made it worse is they invited an extra kid not on the team. I had happy memories otherwise but that really made me realise that they did not like me and honestly is still a bit of a rough memory to this day.", "Then they still can say, no, thank U. NTA", "That\u2019s actually really interesting, I\u2019ve never heard of that term. But I was thinking along the similar lines, there\u2019s definitely a difference between a gut feeling about someone and leaving them out to fit into a popular crowd or something", "I have heard of this phenomenon, but not the term.  I\u2019m not sure I would assume that is going on when I\u2019ve seen kids think others are strange simply because they are different (and not bad) and sometimes in really superficial ways.  I would definitely ask the kid why they are strange, though, as a follow up because that could mean all sorts of things.  But probably it just means they are poor or nerds or something.", "I think that's a very interesting call out. I will have to look into that a bit more to understand it.\n\nI am curious though, how would that be determined to be different to prejudices like racism, or other types of biases? I suspect there might be more to the situation that OP doesn't know yet that might be a factor.\n\nThere are plenty of learning opportunities in this situation for both aOp and the daughter it would seem.", "There\u2019s a difference between what you\u2019re describing and a twelve year old wanting to exclude a kid because they\u2019re wEiRd", "She's not walking down a dark alley. She's excluding the kids people hate (most likely for a disability if we're being realistic) for a 12 year old birthday party.", "Exactly, \u201cstrange\u201d could be anything from \u201cdoesn\u2019t watch the same tv shows as everyone else\u201d to \u201ctried coercing everyone at recess to make a blood sacrifice to the goblin that lives under the school and threatened to spill our secrets if we didn\u2019t\u201d but the latter might count as bullying so idk", "Yea, another commenter suggested that I ask the teacher about any interactions that have seemed off for further insight\u2014will be doing this for sure.

There is zero chance of his daughter not sharing the knowledge that she didn't want these three kids at the party....when talking about it to her friends she will undoubtedly say \"my dad is making me invite x, y and z, but I don't want them there\". This will get back to the kids in question, either before the party (and then they have the agonising feeling of not knowing if they should actually go) or during the party. \n\nPunishing his daughter for having preferences is also not great\n\nI'd say \"YTA\" for making it an all-or-nothing situation.

Is it only kids that are in a majority of her classes?

I made the other person more important. I said the whole \u201chow would you feel\u201d. But at the end of the day, I made her do something she felt wrong doing. The whole comment you made about women is so true. We are usually taught to put everyone else first.

It may be that she IS being bullied or feels uncomfortable around them for some reason and she was too embarrassed to tell you about it. It may be they have some behavioral or other issues. It could be these are the unpopular kids in her class and everyone leaves them out (which is why when she said she wanted to invite her entire class, she wasn't thinking of them.) It could be any number of things. But excluding those three students and inviting everyone else sends a strong message. She needs help understanding this. I can understand, from her perspective, feeling forced to invite people to her party whom she doesn't like.

I would never impose a \"less than half the class or everyone\" rule tbh, it would result in considering \"bullying\" so many situations that are 100% normal and reciprocated (it was normal that the boys invited just the boys+ those 2/3 girls they considered \"fun\").

As long as she\u2019s polite to them and thanks then for presents it should be okay. \n\nIn a smaller group that would be way more obvious.", "Idk maybe Im a littlw weird here but, Iwas never invited other than by close friends, but I never cared because they weren't my actual friends. I'd feel odd if they did invite me anyways because I didn't talk or interact with them if I didn't have to.\n\nI have a feeling that OPs daughter does not interact with these 3 people in question. Depending on how old these kids are, I feel like they would know or find out real quick if they were a pity invite and no one really wanted them there.", "Or how to teach your kid not to be a bully and that being polite to people you maybe don't always enjoy (she said they were weird, not that she hated them or that they were mean or awful people) is an important social skill to have for the rest of your life because you're going to not like coworkers and bosses and teachers and other people in your lives.", ">No, they have different interests.\n\nProvide the quote where it was stated this was the reason.\n\n>That the problem girls automatically have to suck it up and be kind\n\nAnd now we're trying to turn this into a sexist issue? When did I say I wouldn't expect the same of boys? I'm just saying teen girls are assholes because I was literally a teen girl myself.\n\n>HER WANTS ON HER BIRTHDAY SHOULD MATTER\n\nHOLY SHIT WITH THE CAPS TURN ON THE FANCY EDITOR\n\nAnd stop spoiling kids. This is such a first world problem and it's no wonder adult behavior is no better.\n\n>There's no growth in here she should be allowed to set boundaries on her feelings, not anyone else's. \n\nYou are throwing around a lot of buzzwords here. All I want you to explain is this -\n\nIf you don't teach your kid how to treat people, how do you think they learn? You are prioritizing a party over investing time in your kid's growth as a person. Why? It's a wee bit entitled.\n\nThat said, you intentionally brought up inclusion as an issue so I'm getting the feeling you don't *want* to make sure your kid isn't an asshole. Just be upfront with that from the start so we know how to frame your advice. Some parents seem to *like* raising sociopaths.\n\n>was strange showed up to your party because you were forced to invite them\n\nMy parents didn't rent an entire fucking community center and private pool to host 20+ kids so it wasn't an issue. Maybe times have changed but where I'm from, kids just invited their closest friends so it wasn't an issue. \n\nBut since we've apparently normalized *desperately neeeeeeding* a huge party or a call to CPS is in order, now it's more obvious when one or two kids are being excluded. It also carries into the classroom and is a pain in the ass for teachers too but, again, parents don't parent so they don't care about any of that.\n\nIt's telling that these details didn't come up, just like you assumed her reason for excluding these kids rather than wondering if she might be a bully herself. You're taking shortcuts and I just don't understand why people intentionally have kids if that's what they're going to do.", "I was and am extremely likeable (thanks for the implication) I was never actual friends with everyone in my class, save three people. \n\nAnd btw, the reason I am and was likeable is bc my parents instilled values of empathy in me, through things like this.", "I\u2019m even older and I *still* remember being bullied and excluded.", "Im glad things got better. \nMy son\u2019s best friend ended up being home schooled for similar reasons.", "Would you invite someone YOU DONT LIKE to your birthday party? YOU personally?\n\nWould you invite someone YOU DONT like to dinner? Or out to drinks or your wedding?\n\nNO, the answer is NO\u2026I\u2019m not sure why the logic does not work here..\n\n\nOP is essentially saying, I know you don\u2019t like these three people but invite them anyway so what, the people you don\u2019t like can be included? What kinda crazy logic is that?", "If the issue is \"today's standards\", the kids growing up under said standards are, well, still kids. And we still have plenty of entitled and weak adults who grew up under what you consider \"better\" standards. So you're kinda adding 1 to 1 and coming up with [agoobwa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru13J-lwO8Y).", "Honestly, is not about lacking empathy. It\u2019s about living in reality not La La Land..", "Exactly, and as sad as it sounds kids this age could very well decide not to go to the daughters party if the kids that they don\u2019t like are going to be there\u2026", "Again, middle schoolers are notorious for not sharing all of the details with their parents/teachers. You absolutely CANNOT rule that out.", "Imma point out a few things: \n\n1 in the post, it said the kids were strange she didn't like them. That's reasoning enough to exclude them from a day that supposed to be for  her.\n2 it true. This happens to girls more than boys because we are supposed to be nice, so our feelings get tossed out of the window.\n3. You can still be a nice person without including people who make you uncomfortable. I'm very nice but wouldn't invite someone I disliked to something I'm supposed to enjoy no matter who i invited. It's called boundaries. Girls especially need to learn that because we tend to get pushed around more. \n4 I do agree that some parents like to raise crazy but not everyone does. That doesn't mean kids' boundaries shouldn't be respected they have feelings and thoughts to \n5 personally I didn't have a huge party either would've liked my cousins not to come bc it tended to ruin my already shared birthday. (My youngest sister is 5 years 8 days apart from me) so before she was born and at the age of 17 my birthday fell on her birthday so never celebrated on my own birthday but I still only invited two or three friends. My dad was poor, so it was at a park or our house.  He never forced me to invite someone I didn't want there. He, as a father, should do the same. I'm not saying a huge party is the right thing to do. I'm saying he should respect his daughter boundaries \n6 it said in the paragraph the reason she didn't want to invite them", "It MUCH worse\u2026that\u2019s why there is an increase in anxiety and mental health issues amongst children and teens\u2026\n\nWe can debate mental health issues all day, but ultimately it comes down to this herd mentality of \u201cwhat\u2019s fair\u201d and \u201cwhats right\u201d.."]}
