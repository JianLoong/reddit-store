He has a coworker who has constantly overstepped boundaries and tried to flirt with him for almost a year now. She had gotten a little bit better since we got married, but not very much. He also works at a small job with only about 5-6 total employees that helps care for aminals. \n\nHere is what happened this morning:\n\nThis coworker has a streak with my husband on snapchat and I've been noticing lately that she has been sending her streaks snapchat to him in her sports bra and boxers (what she sleeps in she claims) and as much as i didnt like it i let it go because my husband doesn't respond when she sends anything weird and really only responds to work related issues. And before anyone asks, yes we have an open phone policy in our marriage. We both have nothing to hide from each other and he definitely isn't \"hiding\" her. He lets me read their text messages and look at their snaps all the time. HOWEVER, this morning I go to send his streaks for him because he always forgets and I like to keep our streak (I'm just weird like that). And I open hers to see that she has send him yet another streaks picture in her bra and boxers expect this time she is pulling down the boxers on one side and exposing her thong and half of her ass. I was not cool with this at all. So I messaged her off his phone and said, \"hey I'm married. You have got to stop sending me those types of pictures\" to which she replied, \"I sent that to all my streaks it's just a joke.\" I told my husband and he BLEW UP on me. I understand I shouldn't be texting people from his phone but he wasn't mad about that. He called me an asshole because I now interfered with his work and when he went in this morning she was gonna make his whole day a living hell. He told me she does this by giving him the grunt work that no one else wants to do, makes him do it alone, and makes everyone else not talk to him all day while on shift. (She isnt his boss or anything, but she has been there longer and has seniority. All of her friends also work at this place.) I personally think that's got to be against some sort of HR policy because it smells like sexual harassment to me. I just feel like I didn't do anything wrong by setting a boundary with her that he is afraid to set because he is afraid of her retaliation at work. However, I also understand where he is coming from not wanting me to interfere because he doesn't want to make it awkward. But those snaps aren't okay to send fully committed married men. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1678625017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pdono/aita_for_texting_my_husbands_coworker_off_his/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't say no to sexual advances from a person with power, or there will be retaliation in the workplace. Save the evidence in case this turns ugly at work.\n\nThe secondary issue is, you're probably wondering if the sexual advances were really unwanted, but that's a question for your husband. \n\nNTA", "From reading your history, this guy is cheating. End of story.", "Good grief!   That gal is SO out of line, that is appalling.\n\nI'm going to say NTA because I would blow my lid too and someone had to tell her.\n\nYour husband needs to set boundaries and go to HR.   That is ridiculous", "NTA oh my god?\n\nWhat mentally sound coworker sends softporn to a married guy? On snapchat nonetheless?\n\nThe girl is the real AH here- but I\u2019m not sure why your husband was so upset either. Ick.", "NTA\n\nLet's be clear. Since when sending some private Snapchat content is related directly to work? Furthermore, we're not talking about just few texts, but videos of her exposing herself (quote: \"And I open hers to see that she has send him yet another streaks picture\n in her bra and boxers expect this time she is pulling down the boxers \non one side and exposing her thong and half of her ass.\").\n\nYeah, it's basically a sexual harassment, and there are many laws and regulations about it, even in his company. Did she send this kind of content to the HR too? Probably not, and we know why.\n\nBesides, your husband reaction is really weird and astonishing: \"when he went in this morning she was gonna make his whole day a living hell. He told me she does this by giving him the grunt work that no one else wants to do, makes him do it alone, and makes everyone else not talk to him all day while on shift.\" Do you know what it is? Pure harassment and overpower manoeuvers. And agin, it's illegal. If she retaliates to that message by punishing him, she can kiss her butt goodbye because it becomes a legal case!\n\nShe steps over professional and personnal boundaries here, she is at fault, not you or your husband. It's time to contact a lawyer and your HR, because her actions are illegal! Do it as soon as possible and save every evidence against her now.\n\nThe coworker A-score: 7/10 (multiple felonies)\n\nEdit: OP, I did a quick research and, by considering you're in USA, I saw this in the EEOC website.\n- sexual harassment - https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment\n- (workplace) harassment - https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment\n\nYou have to act fast, gather every evidence you can (snapchat videos, mails, voice recordings...) and consult a lawyer. There's a possible lawsuit here, and it would end pretty badly for her.", "NTA. I would be livid and probably react the same way. Although, I have to ask, could he possibly be cheating?", "ESH\nYou are NA for being uncomfortable about her snaps, but you can't just impersonate your husband. But your husband should be the one setting boundaries.\n\nI'd say, let him see how to cool off the situation to his best convenience, even if he has to apologize, but from now on, when she sends snaps, he replies with a snap of you two cuddling.", "YTA. You do know he's cheating or headed that way with her. It's so textbook sexual harassment, I don't understand why hubby hasn't dealt with it unless he's ok with it. \n\nAnd open phone policy can also mean that someone is very good at hiding their tracks. Delete everything immediately.", "ESH. \n\nFirst of all the coworker is way out of line. They are not friends they are coworkers. There\u2019s no reason whatsoever she needs to be sending any types of photos like that.\n\nHowever you may have a open phone policy but the boundary between your husband and the coworker needs to be placed by your husband and not you. And personated him should\u2019ve talk to your husband instead and asked him to set boundaries. You definitely crossed the line", "He\u2019s passed because you set a boundary that he DIDN\u2019T want. He\u2019s gaslighting you and that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s pissed off. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good partner - if something like this ruffled him. I wonder what he would think if some guy you worked with sent you a picture like that? Or- what would he think if you sent pictures of yourself (dressed the same way and pulling one side down exposing you ass) would he mind? You had every right to text her back from his phone! Him getting upset is very suspect\u2026 he already said she\u2019s NOT his boss or anyone with authority. So what\u2019s up then?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's a long time over a pretty changeable phase of life. I'm sorry, I wonder too whether he's cheating. NTA but I wouldn't assume your husband is being imposed upon here.", "The only reason why you softly may be TA is because you sent a message as him, if had said just \"this is X's wife, stop sending this shit\" you would be 100% right. But wow she's so out of line I understand you'd just react like that.\nAlso that's the definition of harassment, ask your husband why he won't turn her in to HR. She needs to be fired and it should be obvious to your husband as well, unless there's an hidden reason for his behaviour.", "Soft YTA. I get it but you shouldn\u2019t have done that though his phone", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that you feel uncomfortable with the coworker's behavior and that you wanted to set a boundary. However, it's not appropriate for you to text her from your husband's phone without his permission, even if you were trying to help him by keeping him out of an uncomfortable situation.  \nYour husband's reaction seems to be based on his fear of his coworker's retaliation at work, which is understandable given the power dynamics at play. It's important to address the issue of sexual harassment and the potential impact on his work environment. You could encourage your husband to document any instances of harassment or retaliation and to speak to his manager or HR representative about the situation.  \nIt's important to establish clear boundaries and expectations in any relationship, and it sounds like this situation has highlighted some areas where you and your husband may need to have further discussions. You can both work together to find a solution that works for both of you and respects each other's boundaries.", "ESH\n\nThe open phone policy gives me a icky feelin. Like you actually regularly check through his phone? And I\u2019m assuming he does the same to you. Sounds bloody weird to me. \n\nHow about a trust policy? \n\nAs for what you said to her. I mean he set himself up for that: he asked you to reply and you did. \n\nYour issue isn\u2019t with her though; but with your partner. He needs to establish boundaries with this girl: it\u2019s no wonder you feel the need to check up on him", "I'm leaning towards YTA. It's one thing to look, but impersonating your husband (w/out his knowledge or permission) was wrong, especially if it's going to cause extra drama for him at work. Yes, HR should be involved bc this is sexual harassment, but since you've mentioned it's a small company the HR department may be lax to basically non-existent except on paper, and he may be worried about retaliation. Your husband shouldn't have exploded like that, but I can't say that I blame him for being upset.", "Nta.", "YTA\n\nDoesn't matter what the context is. You don't pretend to be someone else and send messages from them without their explicit permission.\n\nYour husband is the victim here, not you. He's being sexually harassed by someone senior at work and she will make his life miserable because he reacted in a way she didn't like. You went charging into the middle of a situation you didn't understand and made his life that much harder.\n\nI don't like this usually but... If the genders were reversed there'd be a different response but for some reason we like to think men can't be victims or uncomfortable or sexually harassed.", "YTA for having pretended to be your husband. You have majorly overstepped all boundaries. Your husband's colleague shouldn't be sending that kind of pictures, no, but that is for your husband to deal with.", "ESH: you shouldn\u2019t have text from his phone, however he should have nipped this in the bud a long time ago and set a clear boundary that she should only be texting him for work related issues.", "This is sexual harassment! The fact she will make his life hell at work means she's also commiting workplace bullying.\n\nHe needs to contact HR.\n\nNTA but if your husband doesn't deal with this he will be the AH!", "NTA but WTH is he on Snapchat with a coworker? If it is a professional relationship he needs to remove her from every social app period.", "NTA it\u2019s definitely sexual harassment. You should talk to your husband about it - if he refuses to acknowledge that it\u2019s sexual harassment, you should ask if he\u2019s involved with her.", "NTA and what he\u2019s describing is literally sexual harassment. If he doesn\u2019t respond positively to her sexual advances, he is punished with the grunt work. I mean\u2026. it couldn\u2019t be more cut and dry", "NTA. She is sexually harassing him and he needs to put a stop to it.", "Why doesn\u2019t he just block her on Snapchat?  There\u2019s obviously something more going on there with them. If I had a female colleague send anything like that I\u2019d expect my wife to tear me a new one and I\u2019d block them and that\u2019s it.  Yes it was wrong of you to respond but he\u2019s definitely in the wrong here.", "NTA and that\u2019s illegal. I\u2019d get her fired", "\"you can flirt with my man. If he flirts back he's yours\"", "DEFINITELY NTA \nGirl, according to your history this has been going on for well over a year despite you maintaining that you are uncomfortable with this. You need to establish HARD boundaries. No excuses from your husband. No one needs to maintain a constant semi nude Snapchat streak or text their coworkers reassuring them they are pretty to maintain a cordial relationship at work,and if that is the case then it needs to be brought to the managers to escalate because it\u2019s SEXUAL HARASSMENT. If he refuses to do any of this, chances are he doesn\u2019t actually mind his daily semi nude he\u2019s getting from her and you should be worried. Is he still looking for another job? Has he brought this up with the managers or owners of the company? Does he realize that with the amount of evidence he has, if any retaliation WERE to happen, that could easily be brought to a lawsuit against the company? \n\nThe fact that he is so angry at YOU and not this other woman for harassing him and making you uncomfortable is very odd, SO many red flags \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8", "I\u2019d save the evidence as a copy on your phone.", "Been together since 15. He\u2019s definitely starting to wonder what it would be like to be with another girl.", "This the husband needed to stop it whenever she did it the first time. But also they don't need to be Snapchat friends. They are work colleagues. If there is something important text or call (with her probably rather text). Your husband is also TA", "Yah, no. The girl can do whatever she wants. ITS THE HUSBAND WHOSE THE AH. \nIts on him to set boundaries like the one his wife sent from his phone. \nIts on him to open the soft porn and keep on with it. \nIts on him to go to hr and make a claim on sexual harassment. \nIts on him to respect his wife by all of the above. \nBut sadly he\u2019s cheating on her. So he wont do any of those things.\nGirl get out of there.", "If it\u2019s a small business, locally owned, not franchises, etc\u2026 5 to 6 people probably doesn\u2019t have an HR", "You forgot something big here: the coworker here has threaten him to do the \"chores\", all the unwanted tasks. That's called retaliation and it's prohibited, in laws or company policies. OP here revealed an illegal situation here, and even their HR will have to manage the case ASAP, because OP and her husband can take this over a legal action.\n\nSo it's a bit weird when you talk about \"drama\" while it's a clear case of harassment and retaliation...", "And the husband is doing nothing about it, but worse, he's under harassment and retaliation. Did you not see it, and basically, how the coworker is the only A here?", "This is my fear.", "I get the impression that the girl is her husband\u2019s superior at work in some way. Would love more information on that.\n\nBecause i actually agree- why hasn\u2019t OP\u2019s husband done literally anything to get this girl to stop, and proceeded to get mad at OP for trying to intervene?\n\nWeird on both parts", "Well it's debatable if she can send pics. She knows he's married and according to op he doesn't reply to those things, so it should send the message he's uncomfortable.\nBut retaliation based on seniority? Naaaaah. She should be fired. That's big", "It is but it\u2019s something the husband has to deal with. OP cannot do it for him.", "Honestly I would talk to him about that. I was in a similar situation. Not as long a relationship, but I was there first and only and found out through friends they we\u2019re definitely curious about being with other guys. But weren\u2019t acting on that curiosity. \n\nI decided to confront him about it and it was good for our relationship. We decided to take a break so he could have some fun with other guys, while he was still young, still into clubbing, and guys were stil chasing him. \n\nI didn\u2019t want him to wake up in 10yrs regretting life and blaming me for it", "He said she wasn\u2019t the boss or had any authority over him\u2026 so then- why is he upset because she put a boundary out there \u201c? and he didn\u2019t want it!\u2026 there\u2019s more to this story then OP knows.", ">but she has been there longer and has seniority. \n\nI think this suggests that she does have authority over him. She gets to decide what he does at work."]}
