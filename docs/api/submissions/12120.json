He has a coworker who has constantly overstepped boundaries and tried to flirt with him for almost a year now. She had gotten a little bit better since we got married, but not very much. He also works at a small job with only about 5-6 total employees that helps care for aminals. \n\nHere is what happened this morning:\n\nThis coworker has a streak with my husband on snapchat and I've been noticing lately that she has been sending her streaks snapchat to him in her sports bra and boxers (what she sleeps in she claims) and as much as i didnt like it i let it go because my husband doesn't respond when she sends anything weird and really only responds to work related issues. And before anyone asks, yes we have an open phone policy in our marriage. We both have nothing to hide from each other and he definitely isn't \"hiding\" her. He lets me read their text messages and look at their snaps all the time. HOWEVER, this morning I go to send his streaks for him because he always forgets and I like to keep our streak (I'm just weird like that). And I open hers to see that she has send him yet another streaks picture in her bra and boxers expect this time she is pulling down the boxers on one side and exposing her thong and half of her ass. I was not cool with this at all. So I messaged her off his phone and said, \"hey I'm married. You have got to stop sending me those types of pictures\" to which she replied, \"I sent that to all my streaks it's just a joke.\" I told my husband and he BLEW UP on me. I understand I shouldn't be texting people from his phone but he wasn't mad about that. He called me an asshole because I now interfered with his work and when he went in this morning she was gonna make his whole day a living hell. He told me she does this by giving him the grunt work that no one else wants to do, makes him do it alone, and makes everyone else not talk to him all day while on shift. (She isnt his boss or anything, but she has been there longer and has seniority. All of her friends also work at this place.) I personally think that's got to be against some sort of HR policy because it smells like sexual harassment to me. I just feel like I didn't do anything wrong by setting a boundary with her that he is afraid to set because he is afraid of her retaliation at work. However, I also understand where he is coming from not wanting me to interfere because he doesn't want to make it awkward. But those snaps aren't okay to send fully committed married men. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1678625017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pdono/aita_for_texting_my_husbands_coworker_off_his/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't say no to sexual advances from a person with power, or there will be retaliation in the workplace.

End of story.", "Good grief!   That gal is SO out of line, that is appalling.\n\nI'm going to say NTA because I would blow my lid too and someone had to tell her.\n\nYour husband needs to set boundaries and go to HR.   That is ridiculous", "NTA oh my god?\n\nWhat mentally sound coworker sends softporn to a married guy? On snapchat nonetheless?\n\nThe girl is the real AH here- but I\u2019m not sure why your husband was so upset either. Ick.", "NTA\n\nLet's be clear. Since when sending some private Snapchat content is related directly to work? Furthermore, we're not talking about just few texts, but videos of her exposing herself (quote: \"And I open hers to see that she has send him yet another streaks picture\n in her bra and boxers expect this time she is pulling down the boxers \non one side and exposing her thong and half of her ass.\").\n\nYeah, it's basically a sexual harassment, and there are many laws and regulations about it, even in his company. Did she send this kind of content to the HR too? Probably not, and we know why.\n\nBesides, your husband reaction is really weird and astonishing: \"when he went in this morning she was gonna make his whole day a living hell. He told me she does this by giving him the grunt work that no one else wants to do, makes him do it alone, and makes everyone else not talk to him all day while on shift.\" Do you know what it is? Pure harassment and overpower manoeuvers. And agin, it's illegal. If she retaliates to that message by punishing him, she can kiss her butt goodbye because it becomes a legal case!\n\nShe steps over professional and personnal boundaries here, she is at fault, not you or your husband. It's time to contact a lawyer and your HR, because her actions are illegal! Do it as soon as possible and save every evidence against her now.\n\nThe coworker A-score: 7/10 (multiple felonies)\n\nEdit: OP, I did a quick research and, by considering you're in USA, I saw this in the EEOC website.\n- sexual harassment - https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment\n- (workplace) harassment - https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment\n\nYou have to act fast, gather every evidence you can (snapchat videos, mails, voice recordings...) and consult a lawyer. There's a possible lawsuit here, and it would end pretty badly for her.", "NTA. I would be livid and probably react the same way. Although, I have to ask, could he possibly be cheating?", "ESH\nYou are NA for being uncomfortable about her snaps, but you can't just impersonate your husband. But your husband should be the one setting boundaries.\n\nI'd say, let him see how to cool off the situation to his best convenience, even if he has to apologize, but from now on, when she sends snaps, he replies with a snap of you two cuddling.", "YTA. You do know he's cheating or headed that way with her. It's so textbook sexual harassment, I don't understand why hubby hasn't dealt with it unless he's ok with it. \n\nAnd open phone policy can also mean that someone is very good at hiding their tracks. Delete everything immediately.", "ESH. \n\nFirst of all the coworker is way out of line. They are not friends they are coworkers. There\u2019s no reason whatsoever she needs to be sending any types of photos like that.\n\nHowever you may have a open phone policy but the boundary between your husband and the coworker needs to be placed by your husband and not you. And instead of impersonating him should\u2019ve talk to your husband instead and asked him to set boundaries. You definitely crossed the line", "He\u2019s passed because you set a boundary that he DIDN\u2019T want. He\u2019s gaslighting you and that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s pissed off. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good partner - if something like this ruffled him. I wonder what he would think if some guy you worked with sent you a picture like that? Or- what would he think if you sent pictures of yourself (dressed the same way and pulling one side down exposing you ass) would he mind? You had every right to text her back from his phone!

It's important to address the issue of sexual harassment and the potential impact on his work environment. You could encourage your husband to document any instances of harassment or retaliation and to speak to his manager or HR representative about the situation.  \nIt's important to establish clear boundaries and expectations in any relationship, and it sounds like this situation has highlighted some areas where you and your husband may need to have further discussions.

Like you actually regularly check through his phone? And I\u2019m assuming he does the same to you. Sounds bloody weird to me. \n\nHow about a trust policy? \n\nAs for what you said to her. I mean he set himself up for that: he asked you to reply and you did. \n\nYour issue isn\u2019t with her though; but with your partner.

It's one thing to look, but impersonating your husband (w/out his knowledge or permission) was wrong, especially if it's going to cause extra drama for him at work. Yes, HR should be involved bc this is sexual harassment, but since you've mentioned it's a small company the HR department may be lax to basically non-existent except on paper, and he may be worried about retaliation.

You need to establish HARD boundaries. No excuses from your husband.

If he refuses to do any of this, chances are he doesn\u2019t actually mind his daily semi nude he\u2019s getting from her and you should be worried. Is he still looking for another job? Has he brought this up with the managers or owners of the company? Does he realize that with the amount of evidence he has, if any retaliation WERE to happen, that could easily be brought to a lawsuit against the company? \n\nThe fact that he is so angry at YOU and not this other woman for harassing him and making you uncomfortable is very odd, SO many red flags \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8", "I\u2019d save the evidence as a copy on your phone.", "Been together since 15.

So either he's lying about only responding when it's work related, or he's sending a generic response to every near-nude he receives.

Either way, she's either sexually harassing him - and using her position to punish him at work - OR he's cheating on you, physically or emotionally or both, and no amount of helicopter social media-ing is going to save your relationship.

The fix to this is to communicate to your husband that you are feeling insecure, why you are feeling that way, and clearly define what you need to resolve it.\n\nYour husband is an AH for enabling an abusive work environment out of a desire to not rock the boat. I understand he\u2019s a victim but it\u2019s clearly now affecting his married life and that\u2019s not acceptable behavior. I empathize with his situation.

She retaliates against coworkers when they try to assert boundaries. She sounds like a nightmare.

For every person saying N T A, I think there is a massive double standard going on here.

He has not cheated previously that's why this is so hard for me to wrap my head around. He is also not resistant to looking for a new job. He currently has two so this job is only half of his week but with the financial situation we are in he can't quit one without having another one to replace it and he hasn't been able to find one yet. As far as I know, he has never deleted the messages but after reading some of these responses, what really do I know? I feel horrible for making this about me but I didn't realize she was being crazy at work too. I thought it was just her being gross and I was like okay well this needs to stop. I def think I am an asshole for texting her but I'm gonna talk to him tonight about it being harassment because I don't think he realizes that's what is going on because he is a man and she is a women. Thank you for the response.", "Seconding this.\n\nShe is completely out of line. He should be shutting this shit down himself. But impersonating him is unacceptable and makes you an AH too, as is messaging her at all without talking to him first. This is his work life you\u2019re messing with, it\u2019s on him to resolve. You\u2019re completely right to be annoyed but this was too far.", "He does enjoy it. Streaks only last when both people send them, so he sends something to her at least once a day.", "Yeah some of these comments feel victim-blamey to me.  If what the husband says about his work situation is true, there are all sorts of reasons he may not want to report it (like being afraid of additional consequences).  \u201cGrey-rocking\u201d to avoid conflict is a common tactic to deal with harassment.\n\nThat being said, isn\u2019t mute a thing on Snapchat?", "There are still laws against SH", "This is a great response OP.  Please keep in mind that he may be embarrassed or ashamed about the situation.  Being a victim of abuse and harassment can bring up a lot of feelings, and I hope you all find some resources that can help him with the situation.", "OP, I was in your situation. Internet and app cheating is cheating. In the best case scenario, he was letting her text him and never said anything inappropriate - but you don\u2019t know, and you don\u2019t know how they talk at work. \n\nYou need to talk to your husband about some boundaries on your relationship and define infidelity. It is reasonable to include this. \n\nTalk to your closest people. In my experience, hiding this from friends or close family means you\u2019re hiding your relationship issues for a reason, like secret shame. \n\nYou\u2019re young. You don\u2019t want to be 35, saddled with kids, and find out that this escalated.", "Girl he isn't hiding it from you (although why is she not blocked at this point). Don't let these women put cheating in your head. You said yourself he hasn't responded and is very open about it.", "I didn\u2019t say anything about that.", "Also have a conversation about what each other considers cheating. Lines get crossed when no one knows where it is", "True. Just pointing out there doesn't need to be an HR dept.", "But the avenue of the complaint will be different", "Oh for sure. Go to boss or right to EEOC (if in US)", ">I just feel like I didn't do anything wrong by setting a boundary with her that he is afraid to set because he is afraid of her retaliation at work.\n\nYou don't get to set his boundaries. You don't have the right to take actions for someone else when they are the ones who will bear the negative consequences. \n\nIf you don't like the fact that he values not having his work life disrupted over respecting his relationship to you- that's an issue you need to take up with him. It's not something you can unilaterally decide how to handle. \n\nYour actions were dishonest and controlling. You were selfish and inconsiderate. YTA\n\nThis isn't an issue with this girl being inappropriate. It's an issue with your husband not telling her to stop. You have a husband problem.", "I\u2019ve read your post history where they were messaging a year ago! Well this guy is either loving the attention and doesn\u2019t care for your feelings or he is having an affair. \nEither way he\u2019s encouraged this behaviour for far too long I would be giving solid ultimatum either quit that job and snap or divorce! NTA", "Reading your past posts and this isn\u2019t the first time your husband \u201cinnocently\u201c received inappropriate, flirtatious texts from another woman.   \n\n\nSweetie, where there is smoke, there is fire. Just because he is letting you read the texts doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t deleting portions or entire conversations before he lets you read them. Do a search for dick pics and nude photos on his phone. I think a lot more is going on here than you realize.   \n\n\nHow is it that different women are randomly sending your husband flirty texts\u2026and he is entirely innocent?", "I\u2019m seeing a lot of missing pieces in this story. Funny how he has never, that was mentioned, asked her to stop. Open phone policies don\u2019t mean jack. \n\nAlso, 13-15 years old?!", "ESE.", "NTA! I hate Snapchat so very much. Been a hot problem in my relationship. Honestly I would tell him he needs to unfollow her, or seriously set some boundaries because it\u2019s just disrespectful to you at this point.", "How exactly is asking his co-worker to stop flashing her undies interfering with your husbands work?", "Yikes, that is sexual harassment and sorry he's dealing with that. \n\nYou shouldn't have posted from his phone even if you all are ok with access. \n\nHe was understandably upset with you for posting from his phone as him but some of his anger sounds misplaced because the fact this coworker would retaliate is not your fault. Again, I'm sorry he's dealing with this, it sucks. \n\nI think you need to make amends with him so you can both focus on the real issue here which is how he's going to handle being sexually harassed by a coworker.", "NTA. Either it's sexual harassment or you just messed up his fling with her and he'll have to work to repair it. His reaction said a lot about his priorities. Is there no one to report her behavior to? (That's *if* he wanted it to stop.)", "Make sure you save proof for your own record. As it is possible that it may be consensual. No idea if it is or isn't. But it seems off that he would keep someone on there who is sending him videos of her in her bra. And the fact that he got upset when you told her that.   \n\n\nI mean for work purposes, she could just call work and have them relay the message. Or she could just call when something needs to be addressed.   \n\n\nI know you may not want to think that this is an issue. But it wouldn't hurt to have proof, just incase he won't file a complaint against her. And the messages either stop, or start getting hidden.", "NTA\n\nHe either doesn't like it and is being harassed by her or he likes it. A lot. And what you see on his phone is the stuff you're allowed to see. \n\nQuite frankly, if he didn't like it he probably wouldn't be accepting message from her or be her friend on any apps", "NTA. Your husband is being sexually harass by a coworker. Sit him down and explain to him what sexual harassment is. Then have him compiled every thing she has sent him and have him go speak with HR or sit with a lawyer first if he\u2019s worried about this incident being swept under the rug.", "You've been with this person since age 13/15? \n\nHis reaction tells me he is into it and this won't be the last girl he entertains", "YTA. Husband lets you see all the messages. Leaves his phone out and unlocked for you to look at anytime you like. You messaged his co-worker, pretending to be him, without talking to him about it.\n\nBut somehow, all the typical users here, are saying everyone but OP is bad.\n\nI wish the members of this group were smart enough to respond to the actual questions being asked. At this point I'm surprised they aren't saying the cell service provider is A H for letting the messages through.", "Sorry, but YTA Now, if you had texted 'Hey, this is Mrs. Do you really think that your employer would believe this is appropriate behavior towards a co-worker? Especially a married one? I'm sure that they wouldn't like a sexual harassment claim lodged against them nor a retaliation claim if you act in a manner after this that punishes that co-worker. There is also that little 'alienation of affection' that might be brought against you personally as you are causing discord in my marriage by using your senior position to harass  and cause a fear of retaliation in the workplace that makes it hard for us to report your actions.'  Or print out the pictures and make 100 copies to send/post to a whole bunch of people, including the employer. While that all would be fun and effective and I would do it, it's not for everyone to be so combative. I can be a bit of a witch and just don't give a flying fluck when someone is being like that woman. Just make sure you forward/save all the crap she is sending your husband just in case. My husband would have nipped this from the beginning. He would've blocked anyone behaving like this and said publicly/mass text/email to every co-worker/boss that any work related information should be sent by email because he was getting some very questionable and unwanted contact and content through other means. He also would have especially acted fast as I would actually do what I stated above.", "NTA- time to talk (email) HR with pics.

Your husband is in a bad situation and you are doing your best to make his life 5 times worse.", "ESH!!\n\nOP has been with the husband since she was 13? \n\nThese are kids.

Sounds like generational trauma.", "NTA and he shouldn\u2019t be snap chatting with her", "Your husband wants to know what else is out there cause you\u2019ve been together since he was 15. An \u201copen phone policy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t delete stuff or that he tells you everything. You shouldn\u2019t have sent a message from his phone- but his reaction is a huge red flag. You better have an open and honest discussion with your husband before things get worse.", "YTA\n\nYour husbands coworker is 100% sexually harassing him, but it is HIS choice how he wants to deal with it.  You completely overstepped when you impersonated him, and took away his freedom and ability to respond to the situation in his own way", "NTA. Though you shouldn't have pretended to be him when texting.", "How does he know that she will do that? Has he stood up to her before?", "NTA.\n\nBut my thoughts are:\n1) Why hasn\u2019t he blocked her?\n2) Is he entertaining her in some other way you can\u2019t see? I don\u2019t have Snapchat, but is he deleting the streaks? Or perhaps communicating with her some other way?\n3) Have they flirted, dated, \u201chooked up\u201d in the past?", "INFO:\nDoes your open phone policy include sending stuff from each other's phone or is this something neither of you has ever done before?\nAs it stands I'd go with Y T A, since it feels like OP abused the system they had agreed upon. But it's not clear what rules where in place. Something should definitely be done about what is clearly workplace harassment, but this is about OP impersonating him.", "YTA. Your husband is being sexually harassed. He feels like he\u2019s caught between a rock and a hard place and he has to balance the consequences of every action he takes either in relation to you and your marriage or in relation to her and his career. You are worried about stopping the harassment and want to end it because you care about him but he\u2019s more focused on the potential retaliation in the future. Neither of you is wrong to feel this way.  What makes you the asshole is that you took this step without talking to him first. Not only did he not have time to figure out if he was ok with it, he didn\u2019t have time to figure out how to protect himself if retaliation does happen. You skipped several steps and are now asking if the end (which may have been the eventual outcome after all) justified the means and in my opinion they did not.", "NTA and I can\u2019t see how Snapchat has anything to do with work. This needs to be reported to HR as sexual harassment, either that or he is up to more than he is letting on, he might like the attention and the pics.", "YTA. There\u2019s a lot of ppl talking about setting boundaries here, but this was obviously one for your husband and you crossed it. He needs to handle this situation, and if he refuses then the relationship may need to end..", "NTA but a streak on Snapchat is a two way street. I wonder what he has sent her that you don\u2019t know about.", "Soft ESH except your husband. He has shown his loyalty and you could have easily just talked as open as your phone policy. Instead you got sneaky which is a AH move when someone has been super open and not hiding a thing. \n\nHis coworker is a mega AH for sexually harassing him knowing full well no company is going to listen to a man being sexually harassed. \n\nYour husband is potentially being victimized and you let your insecurities trigger it instead of talk to him. \n\nApologize to him and help him navigate this issue as his partner, not a sneak.", "NTA. He\u2019s either cheating or willingly accepts these photos because he likes the attention. At MINIMUM, it\u2019s sexual harassment. She\u2019s way out of line.", "Why hasn\u2019t your husband blocked her on Snapchat though? Why did he get mad you simply told her she needed to stop sending pics because he\u2019s married? Yeah she crossed a line but your husband should\u2019ve stopped her from crossing it and continuing to cross it. He should take it to the higher ups, he\u2019s being sexually harassed yet he\u2019s getting angry at you?", "NTA, and by the way, your husband is cheating.", "OP, either your husband is cheating, or this is sexual harassment. What do you THINK it is? You need to have a serious talk with your husband. Ask him how he would feel if a man was sending you photos of himself without a shirt on in boxers, or pulling down his boxers just enough to get a peak. Tell him that if he's not comfortable with this, he needs to at a MINIMUM block her. But he SHOULD address this with his boss, explain the retaliation he receives if he speaks up, and address it! If he's not willing to, it's time to consider the fact that there's more going on than you're seeing.", "Yes.

And doing that without checking with you first and knowing it Will get you problems.
