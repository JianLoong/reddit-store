He has a coworker who has constantly overstepped boundaries and tried to flirt with him for almost a year now. She had gotten a little bit better since we got married, but not very much. He also works at a small job with only about 5-6 total employees that helps care for aminals. \n\nHere is what happened this morning:\n\nThis coworker has a streak with my husband on snapchat and I've been noticing lately that she has been sending her streaks snapchat to him in her sports bra and boxers (what she sleeps in she claims) and as much as i didnt like it i let it go because my husband doesn't respond when she sends anything weird and really only responds to work related issues. And before anyone asks, yes we have an open phone policy in our marriage. We both have nothing to hide from each other and he definitely isn't \"hiding\" her. He lets me read their text messages and look at their snaps all the time. HOWEVER, this morning I go to send his streaks for him because he always forgets and I like to keep our streak (I'm just weird like that). And I open hers to see that she has send him yet another streaks picture in her bra and boxers expect this time she is pulling down the boxers on one side and exposing her thong and half of her ass. I was not cool with this at all. So I messaged her off his phone and said, \"hey I'm married. You have got to stop sending me those types of pictures\" to which she replied, \"I sent that to all my streaks it's just a joke.\" I told my husband and he BLEW UP on me. I understand I shouldn't be texting people from his phone but he wasn't mad about that. He called me an asshole because I now interfered with his work and when he went in this morning she was gonna make his whole day a living hell. He told me she does this by giving him the grunt work that no one else wants to do, makes him do it alone, and makes everyone else not talk to him all day while on shift. (She isnt his boss or anything, but she has been there longer and has seniority. All of her friends also work at this place.) I personally think that's got to be against some sort of HR policy because it smells like sexual harassment to me. I just feel like I didn't do anything wrong by setting a boundary with her that he is afraid to set because he is afraid of her retaliation at work. However, I also understand where he is coming from not wanting me to interfere because he doesn't want to make it awkward. But those snaps aren't okay to send fully committed married men. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1678625017, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pdono/aita_for_texting_my_husbands_coworker_off_his/", "score": 883, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can't say no to sexual advances from a person with power, or there will be retaliation in the workplace.

End of story.", "Good grief!   That gal is SO out of line, that is appalling.\n\nI'm going to say NTA because I would blow my lid too and someone had to tell her.\n\nYour husband needs to set boundaries and go to HR.   That is ridiculous", "NTA oh my god?\n\nWhat mentally sound coworker sends softporn to a married guy? On snapchat nonetheless?\n\nThe girl is the real AH here- but I\u2019m not sure why your husband was so upset either. Ick.", "NTA\n\nLet's be clear. Since when sending some private Snapchat content is related directly to work? Furthermore, we're not talking about just few texts, but videos of her exposing herself (quote: \"And I open hers to see that she has send him yet another streaks picture\n in her bra and boxers expect this time she is pulling down the boxers \non one side and exposing her thong and half of her ass.\").\n\nYeah, it's basically a sexual harassment, and there are many laws and regulations about it, even in his company. Did she send this kind of content to the HR too? Probably not, and we know why.\n\nBesides, your husband reaction is really weird and astonishing: \"when he went in this morning she was gonna make his whole day a living hell. He told me she does this by giving him the grunt work that no one else wants to do, makes him do it alone, and makes everyone else not talk to him all day while on shift.\" Do you know what it is? Pure harassment and overpower manoeuvers. And agin, it's illegal. If she retaliates to that message by punishing him, she can kiss her butt goodbye because it becomes a legal case!\n\nShe steps over professional and personnal boundaries here, she is at fault, not you or your husband. It's time to contact a lawyer and your HR, because her actions are illegal! Do it as soon as possible and save every evidence against her now.\n\nThe coworker A-score: 7/10 (multiple felonies)\n\nEdit: OP, I did a quick research and, by considering you're in USA, I saw this in the EEOC website.\n- sexual harassment - https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment\n- (workplace) harassment - https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment\n\nYou have to act fast, gather every evidence you can (snapchat videos, mails, voice recordings...) and consult a lawyer. There's a possible lawsuit here, and it would end pretty badly for her.", "NTA. I would be livid and probably react the same way. Although, I have to ask, could he possibly be cheating?", "ESH\nYou are NA for being uncomfortable about her snaps, but you can't just impersonate your husband. But your husband should be the one setting boundaries.\n\nI'd say, let him see how to cool off the situation to his best convenience, even if he has to apologize, but from now on, when she sends snaps, he replies with a snap of you two cuddling.", "YTA. You do know he's cheating or headed that way with her. It's so textbook sexual harassment, I don't understand why hubby hasn't dealt with it unless he's ok with it. \n\nAnd open phone policy can also mean that someone is very good at hiding their tracks. Delete everything immediately.", "ESH. \n\nFirst of all the coworker is way out of line. They are not friends they are coworkers. There\u2019s no reason whatsoever she needs to be sending any types of photos like that.\n\nHowever you may have a open phone policy but the boundary between your husband and the coworker needs to be placed by your husband and not you. And instead of impersonating him should\u2019ve talk to your husband instead and asked him to set boundaries. You definitely crossed the line", "He\u2019s passed because you set a boundary that he DIDN\u2019T want. He\u2019s gaslighting you and that\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s pissed off. He doesn\u2019t sound like a good partner - if something like this ruffled him. I wonder what he would think if some guy you worked with sent you a picture like that? Or- what would he think if you sent pictures of yourself (dressed the same way and pulling one side down exposing you ass) would he mind? You had every right to text her back from his phone!

It's important to address the issue of sexual harassment and the potential impact on his work environment. You could encourage your husband to document any instances of harassment or retaliation and to speak to his manager or HR representative about the situation.  \nIt's important to establish clear boundaries and expectations in any relationship, and it sounds like this situation has highlighted some areas where you and your husband may need to have further discussions.

Like you actually regularly check through his phone? And I\u2019m assuming he does the same to you. Sounds bloody weird to me. \n\nHow about a trust policy? \n\nAs for what you said to her. I mean he set himself up for that: he asked you to reply and you did. \n\nYour issue isn\u2019t with her though; but with your partner.

It's one thing to look, but impersonating your husband (w/out his knowledge or permission) was wrong, especially if it's going to cause extra drama for him at work. Yes, HR should be involved bc this is sexual harassment, but since you've mentioned it's a small company the HR department may be lax to basically non-existent except on paper, and he may be worried about retaliation.

You need to establish HARD boundaries. No excuses from your husband.

Does he realize that with the amount of evidence he has, if any retaliation WERE to happen, that could easily be brought to a lawsuit against the company? \n\nThe fact that he is so angry at YOU and not this other woman for harassing him and making you uncomfortable is very odd, SO many red flags \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8", "I\u2019d save the evidence as a copy on your phone.", "Been together since 15.

So either he's lying about only responding when it's work related, or he's sending a generic response to every near-nude he receives.

Either way, she's either sexually harassing him - and using her position to punish him at work - OR he's cheating on you, physically or emotionally or both, and no amount of helicopter social media-ing is going to save your relationship.

The fix to this is to communicate to your husband that you are feeling insecure, why you are feeling that way, and clearly define what you need to resolve it.\n\nYour husband is an AH for enabling an abusive work environment out of a desire to not rock the boat. I understand he\u2019s a victim but it\u2019s clearly now affecting his married life and that\u2019s not acceptable behavior. I empathize with his situation.

She retaliates against coworkers when they try to assert boundaries. She sounds like a nightmare.

For every person saying N T A, I think there is a massive double standard going on here.

He has not cheated previously that's why this is so hard for me to wrap my head around. He is also not resistant to looking for a new job. He currently has two so this job is only half of his week but with the financial situation we are in he can't quit one without having another one to replace it and he hasn't been able to find one yet. As far as I know, he has never deleted the messages but after reading some of these responses, what really do I know?

Either he doesn\u2019t want this kind of attention from her in which case it\u2019s clear cut sexual harassment and he\u2019s possibly afraid to stand up for himself. Then you should work out how to support him to get out of the situation (ie try not to make this about you primarily). OR he is indifferent about the attention and is deliberately ignoring your boundary. OR he enjoys the attention and doesn\u2019t actually want to stop it.

Everything else is completely inappropriate. NTA", "YTA. You\u2019re right, it sounds like harassment. Harassment is dealt with by contacting HR, not by texting someone pretending to be your husband. He is right to be upset. You should have told him that you would like something done about it. You should have told him that a long time ago instead building up resentment. Since you never said anything, he has every reason to believe that it doesn\u2019t bother you, since he never encourages it nor tries to hide it. As far as he is concerned, you went from \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d straight to \u201cI\u2019m going to commit identity theft\u201d. You broke his trust.", "I don't think he's cheating.

I\u2019d be hurt that he didn\u2019t set up this boundary with her and that he opens up her half naked photos especially when knowing her personally. He doesn\u2019t have to be snapchat friends with his coworker. They can communicate through text about any work questions. \n\nYou are very right. Those snaps are NOT okay to send to married men.

I would consider creating more boundaries within your marriage and relying less on boundaries that your husband has *supposedly* set with his coworker because clearly he doesn't mind receiving these pics all that much if he continues to keep a streak with her. Really interesting to know you have an open phone policy on top of this. From an outside perspective hearing this situation, it seems that he may be taking advantage of your trust/patience and covering up his very questionable interactions with the sentiment that because you're free to look at his phone it means he's automatically not doing anything wrong. Don't let yourself be gaslit here.\n\nI will say ESH, but with sympathy for OP because the husband sounds like a real piece of work.", "ESH \nHe\u2019s full of shit \nAnd you have poor boundaries", "Exactly.

Also, perhaps you should ask your husband to keep his social media separate from work.", "My question, too. \n\nNo employees I know connect over snapchat.\n\nHe should've blocked her the first time she sent something inappropriate. I'm really questioning why he allowed this to go on. Maybe he hasn't been unfaithful yet, but it sure feels like he's leaving that door open by allowing this to continue...", "This.", "Yeah, because in your version OP your husband comes off super weak, like he is incapable of sticking up for himself and a complete weakling. Does this really ring true to you?\n\nOr is it more likely that you are trying to excuse his inexcusable behavior? I think he enjoys the dynamic and doesn\u2019t want it to stop is highly more likely, and he is definitely ignoring your boundaries.", "It would be but he\u2019s lying", "While you\u2019re snooping and having terrible boundaries with his phone\u2026\n\nLook at his deleted photos and hidden photo album. I want to see something.", "I agree. She should\u2019ve told the coworker that she\u2019s the wife.", "That's not actually true.

I know how you feel, and it sucks. But you need to be strong and have a calm, honest discussion with him. The only thing you can control is YOU; your words, your actions. And you need to be able to look in the mirror and respect that person looking back at you. The only thing you did wrong was pretend you were your husband when you replied to her text. Believe me, she would\u2019ve been a lot more afraid of you than of him, anyway.", "*The Gift Of Fear* would tell you to listen to your gut.  You've known him for years and if your body is telling you he's cheating, if your eyes are confirming they're too close and the only evidence he's not are his words then pay attention.\n\nAlso, in the future don't ever get involved with a SO's job and/or coworkers ever again.  You can't control him and trying in that manner reflects poorly on you.", "She isn\u2019t his boss, but she has seniority.", "I agree its inappropriate, i never said otherwise.\nEverybody can do whatever they want, but they are consequences.
