I don\u2019t know what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s not. I do feel a bit like they\u2019re in my business about my place, and my few family members haven\u2019t been overbearing at all wanting to see his parents house or anything. Idk. He\u2019s in his late 20\u2019s", "I prefered it the first time.", "That is a false dichotomy.  OP is not choosing because no choice is necessary. The pictures stay up, mum comes to visit, all act like adults, no harm, no foul.\n\nAnd it  could be turned right around to \"my BFs mother prefers to be offended at a few vintage girlie pinups than to have a relationship with her son's partner.\"", "Fair enough. Even so, imho  \"sexual decorations\" is putting it a bit strongly", "I totally get that you feel like your gut instinct might be off due to your circumstances, but they aren't.\n\nIf really sounds like she is using \"bonding\" as an excuse to get further into your business.", "It's not entirely abnormal for a parent to want to visit at a partner's place - not extremely common but not super weird. It's generally a family culture thing and neither here nor there. \n\nThe actual issue is not his mother necessarily, but his willingness to ask you to change who you present yourself to be so she feels more comfortable. Your comfort is most important in your home. Given the background that she's a bit overbearing in his life, expect that any allowances you make for her now become a give an inch take a mile situation later. \"You to down the posters, why is it a big deal to *insert slightly more intrusive thing here*?\" Progressively escalating. \n\nNow is the time to set and enforce your boundaries. He can warn his mother if he feels he needs to but be clear that you won't be changing your home for her and you won't entertain criticism or other backlash from her or him about it. It's up to him to decide how to navigate it, your job is to avoid becoming part of an enmeshed dynamic where her needs always take priority. \n\nYou're NTA and your boyfriend has some work to do on boundaries", "Lol", "It's about consent. If she barged in unannounced and was upset? No OP wouldn't be the asshole. But if you invite someone into a space with soft core porn (calling in pin ups is all well and good, but OP said they were naked, not spicy bathing suite shots) on the wall without telling them before hand, knowing that it would make them uncomfortable, yea then you are the asshole. I know that reddit has the \"you don't owe anyone anything ever\" brain rot, but we absolutely owe people basic respect and consideration.", "They are sexual. And decorations. If they were cheeky pin ups, titillating but not explicit then I'd agree.", "That does actually make sense. Even so, it makes me uncomfortable that OP should have to pretend. But then what is any social situation if not a performance to some extent.", "Basic respect and consideration is not telling people what to do or how to decorate their house. You don't see OP telling her bfs mom how to decorate her house? Why does the mom /bf get to dictate what she does in her own house. That's the opposite of respect and consideration. That's entitlement", "That's fair,  without seeing them, they could be either.", "Boundaries are important, and while that includes \"I won't be at my dads beck and call to drive him around because he lost his licence\" and \"I will not go to any even where my abuser will be present\" it also means \"I understand what aspects of my life are inappropriate to share with certain people\". OP doesn't stop being OP because they don't have playboy on their livingroom walls for a few hours."]}
