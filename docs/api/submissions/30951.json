{"id": 30951, "submission_id": "17uziyv", "title": "AITA for not attending my sister\u2019s wedding?", "selftext": "My sister (30F) and I (28F) have always had a complicated relationship. She's regarded me as the 'golden child' because I've generally stayed out of trouble, leading our parents to use me as an example for our other siblings. I consistently excelled in school and have now earned a PhD, which may have triggered some envy on her part (or so I assume), as she decided to change her career path to mine and claims she has now started pursuing a PhD herself (which she isn't). This is just one example of how our lives have been ; it\u2019s constant competition, so I usually don\u2019t even share details about my life. \n\nA bit of background: her wedding was canceled a year ago, as her fianc\u00e9 decided to break the engagement just three weeks before the scheduled ceremony. Despite our differences, I supported her during that difficult time, and she expressed gratitude, acknowledging that she hadn't been a great sister in the past, especially during my abusive relationship.\n\nFast forward to today, I've been happily engaged for almost a year and am set to marry in 3 months in my home country. Strangely, my sister, who was supposed to be one of my bridesmaids, hasn't replied to any of my texts nor has she reached out to ask how she can assist, while my other sister and friends have been extremely supportive. Then, just a week ago, my sister announced to the entire family that she's getting married in two weeks to a guy she has known for 6 months and is three months pregnant, making it impossible for her to be a bridesmaid at my wedding. This revelation came as a shock due to the rapid developments. I also cant help but feel like she wanted to get married first and couldn\u2019t stand me getting married before her. \n\nI offered my congratulations, and she inquired if I would attend her wedding. I explained that she'd given me only 13 days' notice to travel 8 hours by flight, and I had numerous work deadlines to contend with, making it impossible for me to attend unless I were to stay for just two days. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 believes I made the right decision, but my sister and some of her friends have portrayed me as bitter for not attending. AITH for not attending??\n\nUpdate: my other sister doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m bitter. My whole family thinks this whole thing is a bit crazy, and they understand that I have a more demanding job that them, and I can\u2019t just leave or get time off that quick. Only my older sister (the one getting married) and some of her friends think I\u2019m being bitter. I am now getting text messages from her friends asking why I\u2019m not coming (it\u2019s 16 hours flight round trip, and they make it seem like it\u2019s a one hour drive). I have made the decision not to go, so I\u2019m here asking if that makes me an AH. If some people think that I am TAH I\u2019m just going to brace myself for what might happen during my wedding.

If you had more notice then I could understand her being upset but as she has given you less than two weeks that's not reasonable to expect you to drop everything.\n\nTell her not to worry and that you will make sure you are at the next one.", "I am curious that  no one, not even your parents knew your sister was at least pregnant? or has mention their concern of a quick marriage?  \n\n\n I am surprised your other sister thinks you might be bitter.

Not only that but she's also essentially making it harder for you to have your wedding because of the changes you'll have to make. Honestly, this sounds very planned. Looks like she's choosing time and time again to be a bitter sister making decisions based off of your life. This is not the way to go. Also, I'd like to say that people can get married at whatever date they want. I just have a problem with this one because I feel like it came with bad intentions.", "NTA.

You did say you feel like she\u2019s done it intentionally to get married before you, so is that the reason?\n\nIf you\u2019re doing it solely because of these feelings, I\u2019d say that\u2019s assholish. You obviously know your sister better than me, but at the same time you\u2019re only guessing and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in her head. Maybe she wants to be married before giving birth and doesn\u2019t want to show in her wedding dress. Maybe she\u2019s wanted to do this ASAP since learning of the pregnancy and has just been holding out to make sure the scans show the baby is healthy. Maybe she\u2019s just made a poor decision without much thought! There\u2019s no way to know and but you should try to give people the benefit of the doubt rather than assuming the worst.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing it because of the travel concerns, maybe a little bit assholish. You say even with the concerns about work and lack of notice you could go for 2 days, so why not go? For my siblings\u2019 weddings I\u2019d travel 8 hours to spend 1 day with them, let alone 2.

She\u2019s had to make a LOT of decisions in the past 6-8 weeks, and you\u2019ve totally failed to acknowledge that (and instead made it about you). \n\nSecond, your method of declining the invitation bothers me.

However, they were trying to get pregnant on purpose. Normally, if she had just told my parents she is getting married, they would have asked her to wait for mine. But if she's pregnant, then their hands are tied. If she had said the pregnancy was an accident, I would be more inclined to think that it wasn't about being married first.", "Those 2 days is property pto she'll need for her own wedding and wedding planning", "Well, she did mention that her pregnancy was planned, so I understand why they made their arrangements. However, it feels inconsiderate that she didn't inform me until the last moment. I can't justify spending over a thousand dollars to travel to a different continent and taking days off for someone who didn't bother to tell me earlier, especially since I'm planning my own wedding. My mother and I even suggested postponing her event to after mid-December (the date wasn\u2019t set yet when she told us) when we would have more availability, but she refused. So, I did try to accommodate.\n\nReflecting on her first engagement, I recall being heavily involved as one of her bridesmaids, from the beginning until it was called off. Since agreeing to be a bridesmaid this time, I haven\u2019t received any messages from her about helping with the preparations. The only update I got after her initial agreement was that her wedding was in two weeks. I understand your perspective, but I can't help feeling this situation reflects a pattern with my sister. For instance, I recently bought a car and only told my mom, but she ended up informing my sister. A month later, my sister, who doesn't even have a license, announced she was car shopping in our family group. It's disheartening; it seems like she's trying to keep up with my life rather than living her own. I do blame my parents for how things have turned out between us, but it is what it is. I hesitate to share details about my life because she either criticizes or imitates them. I may sound bitter, but I've been content doing things my way. \n\nI should also mention that she informed that her and husband will do a gender reveal the day after our wedding, and I just agreed even though we have other events following the wedding for some of our close friends and family.", "Expecting someone to fly to another continent that\u2019s an 8 hour flight so 10-12 hours of travel time with two weeks notice for a last minute wedding is a bit ridiculous. It\u2019s valid to push back on that and raises some yellow, if not red flags. You\u2019re talking at least a full day of travel when all is said and done a last minute PTO request and taking PTO OP likely didn\u2019t calculate for. \n\nIf I had a sibling do that, I\u2019d have concerns. If anything, I would try to make it work not necessarily so I could be a guest at their wedding but moreso out of concern for how fast everything is taking place.", "I get it. My response to her was, \"I would have loved to, but the next three weeks are extremely busy for me. If it weren't for that, I would have been happy to come.\" I didn't accuse her of being last-minute; I'm just explaining the situation to everyone here. Had I known a year or even a month in advance, I could have made arrangements.\n\nI recognize she had to make certain decisions, and I know pregnancy isn't easy. However, I must clarify that jealousy isn't a factor for me here. I feel you might have overlooked some aspects of the situation.", "Mechanical engineering. Why?", "This so much. The oldest sibling, especially the girl, ends up with so much expectations, restrictions and scrutiny. Her resenting you to the extent she is is weird for her.\n\n I\u2019m the oldest daughter, second oldest kid, and everything was put on me bc,\u201d you\u2019re the oldest girl, it\u2019s your responsibility to set the example, take care of everyone, help the parents.\u201d I got the harshest rules and punishments, the greatest expectations and my younger sisters could never do wrong, got to do things I wasn\u2019t even allowed to do, and I was constantly shamed where they were encouraged.\n\nYet despite all of that, I don\u2019t compete or resent my sisters. I celebrate their accomplishments, support them how I can when they need it. The one is very competitive with me and tries to knock me down any chance she gets, and as much as that sucks, I try to not let it get to me. Your sister is just miserable and that won\u2019t change. Don\u2019t let her centre your wedding around her pregnancy, bc she likely will even though she dropped out.", "Just tell her you regret that you can't attend this wedding but (if planned properly) you'll attend the next one.", "Funny enough, the first thing she said to me was how happy our dad was that he gets to have his first grandchild.", "Wow\nIt must REALLY be love at first sight and they must be absolute soulmates, to have a planned pregnancy 3 months into their relationship.  \n\nDon't stress about it, and be glad she's an 8 hour flight away.", "Thanks for providing context, from the way I read your explanation it on the OP it seemed like your sole given rationale for not going was that you could only attend for 2 days which doesn\u2019t seem a valid reason.\n\nYou\u2019ve given some more explanations here, but I\u2019d say that how good a rationale these are depends on context of the situation.\n\nYou mention money and fair enough for some people a thousand dollars on a plane ticket is a deal breaker, I know times in my life when I simply wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it and would have had to refuse to attend. However some people are well off and a thousand dollars isn\u2019t a significant spend.\n\nSimilarly you have your own wedding coming up and want to spend time organising it. I don\u2019t know if you have any hard to reschedule appointments booked or you\u2019ve fallen far behind schedule. Maybe missing these days is going to be a massive hinderance to your plan to get married and maybe you are in a good place and two days missed wouldn\u2019t make a significant difference.\n\nBoth the issues could be legitimate dealbreakers or could be fairly irrelevant and mere excuses depending on your situation, which I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe thing is you qualify your explanation with \u201cI can\u2019t justify\u2026 \u2026for someone who didn\u2019t bother to tell me earlier\u2026\u201d. So I read it as these aren\u2019t hard and fast issues for you and, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if you had to pay $1,000 and take time off work for some other reason (e.g different sister getting married with a reason for short notice you accepted as legitimate) you wouldn\u2019t have the same issue and would just pay the money and take the time off.\n\nSo assuming I\u2019m interpreting the above correctly, the fundamental issue is still just how annoyed you are at her for how she\u2019s planned this at short notice meaning you won\u2019t go to her wedding. If so, my previous comments still largely apply. She may be doing all these things for the reasons you think, but she may not be. Even if you\u2019re best places to make these guesses it\u2019s still guesswork and I think it comes down to \u201cYou won\u2019t attend your sisters wedding because your interpretation of her intentions, which may not be correct, has pissed you off\u201d.\n\nLike I said this is based on some assumptions and if for instance you simply can\u2019t afford to travel, etc then one of my assumptions if wrong, your position is fair and you\u2019re NTA as long as that\u2019s your reason for not going.", "Those could all be perfectly legitimate reasons. If you can\u2019t afford it financially, if you don\u2019t have the time, etc.\n\nHowever as I read it the OP has never at any point outright stated any of that, it\u2019s always been qualified with them not wanting to make that effort *in these particular circumstances* because the way their sister went about it has upset them. That therefore moves the question onto: are they right to be mad at their sister?\n\nThe answer to me is very possibly yes but there\u2019s no guarantee, so if they\u2019re not certain let\u2019s try to be open minded and mend fences rather than explode a family with recriminations that will probably go on for years based on assumptions that could be wrong.", "Then re-read what you wrote in your post\u2026\u201dI explained that she\u2019d given\u2026\u201d\n\nIf you explained this to her, you blamed her for your lack of attendance, when it\u2019s very likely they had an oops pregnancy and are getting married quickly due to that. \n\nI may be wrong-the assessment is just from one post-but your self-centeredness comes through loud and clear. I hope you\u2019re right that it\u2019s not really there and it\u2019s just in the writing.", "It was the opposite for me. My sister was the oldest and I was the youngest with 2 brothers in between. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do most of what the others were allowed to do because I \u201cwas the baby\u201d And apparently my mother wanted to keep me that way as long as possible.", "That might be a bit too petty for the situation, but your head is in the right place.", "Oooooh \ud83d\ude08", "Poor guy doesn't know what he's getting into.", "Yes, I see where I went wrong. I simply told her I couldn't attend due to work commitments. It's important to note, though, that their pregnancy wasn't accidental. They had been trying and knew about it for two months. She even mentioned they're planning a gender reveal the day after our wedding, to which I responded positively. It's challenging to be honest with someone who might perceive your honesty as an attempt to make them feel inferior. My relationship with my sister has always been about agreeing with her and saying things sound great. I avoid giving her tough love because she tends to take it as an attack.\n\nI might come off as bitter in this post, but if it were my other sister or my best friend, I wouldn't have hesitated or questioned whether I was in the right. The dilemma I'm facing is specific to my older sister; I know how she thinks, and I'm trying to navigate that carefully.", "I am afraid I don't see it the way you do.\n\nAre you saying she's self centred because her post suggests the competition between her and her sister is one sided? Making the sister feel inferior is not OP's fault, it's their parents' since all OP did was keep her head down and focus on being get best self. It's also something that no one can rule out because of a pattern of behaviour the sister had done (lied about pursuing a PhD, trying to rush a wedding, ghosting bridesmaid duties).\n\nAs for explaining why she cannot make it, this is more contextual but given that the sisters have not been close in the past, telling her sister she needs more notice allows OP to rebuild the relationship further, as by giving her sister how much notice she needs for travel they can see each other more reliably for future events. That is information that the sister stands to benefit from in future if she wants to rebuild the relationship with OP.\n\nYour absolutist language about the subject makes no room for nuance and I wonder if you're projecting someone from your own life onto OP here.\n\nFor the record, I'm a forgotten child/scapegoat not unlike the sister, and got to where I am with therapy.", "OP's lack of attendance is a direct consequence of sister's choices, not to mention OP's sister advised the baby was actually planned. \n\nLess than 2 weeks notice for a wedding is insane, especially when you know you're inviting people who live far away and then demand people pay thousands on flights. It's an invite, not a summons. \n\nNTA"]}
