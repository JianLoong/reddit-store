She's regarded me as the 'golden child' because I've generally stayed out of trouble, leading our parents to use me as an example for our other siblings. I consistently excelled in school and have now earned a PhD, which may have triggered some envy on her part (or so I assume), as she decided to change her career path to mine and claims she has now started pursuing a PhD herself (which she isn't). This is just one example of how our lives have been ; it\u2019s constant competition, so I usually don\u2019t even share details about my life. \n\nA bit of background: her wedding was canceled a year ago, as her fianc\u00e9 decided to break the engagement just three weeks before the scheduled ceremony. Despite our differences, I supported her during that difficult time, and she expressed gratitude, acknowledging that she hadn't been a great sister in the past, especially during my abusive relationship.\n\nFast forward to today, I've been happily engaged for almost a year and am set to marry in 3 months in my home country. Strangely, my sister, who was supposed to be one of my bridesmaids, hasn't replied to any of my texts nor has she reached out to ask how she can assist, while my other sister and friends have been extremely supportive. Then, just a week ago, my sister announced to the entire family that she's getting married in two weeks to a guy she has known for 6 months and is three months pregnant, making it impossible for her to be a bridesmaid at my wedding. This revelation came as a shock due to the rapid developments. I also cant help but feel like she wanted to get married first and couldn\u2019t stand me getting married before her. \n\nI offered my congratulations, and she inquired if I would attend her wedding. I explained that she'd given me only 13 days' notice to travel 8 hours by flight, and I had numerous work deadlines to contend with, making it impossible for me to attend unless I were to stay for just two days. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 believes I made the right decision, but my sister and some of her friends have portrayed me as bitter for not attending. AITH for not attending??\n\nUpdate: my other sister doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m bitter. My whole family thinks this whole thing is a bit crazy, and they understand that I have a more demanding job that them, and I can\u2019t just leave or get time off that quick. Only my older sister (the one getting married) and some of her friends think I\u2019m being bitter. I am now getting text messages from her friends asking why I\u2019m not coming (it\u2019s 16 hours flight round trip, and they make it seem like it\u2019s a one hour drive). I have made the decision not to go, so I\u2019m here asking if that makes me an AH. If some people think that I am TAH I\u2019m just going to brace myself for what might happen during my wedding. \n\nEdit: I understand why some people are upset, thinking I'm accusing my sister of trying to upstage me, when perhaps she's rushing to get married because she's pregnant. However, she explicitly told me they were trying for a baby. It was a planned pregnancy, not an accident. It's puzzling to me why someone would intentionally become pregnant knowing they wanted to marry first. It seems like it might be a strategy for a quicker wedding. I believe my family would have requested she wait until after my wedding if she weren't pregnant. Additionally, she's planning a gender reveal the day after our wedding. I realize it may sound odd to think this way, and perhaps being in this type of relationship has made me more cynical and narcissistic, as some have suggested. But I struggle to see it that way, as I have never, ever tried to outshine her.", "created_utc": 1699958252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uziyv/aita_for_not_attending_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 2140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not only that but she's also essentially making it harder for you to have your wedding because of the changes you'll have to make. Honestly, this sounds very planned. Looks like she's choosing time and time again to be a bitter sister making decisions based off of your life. This is not the way to go. Also, I'd like to say that people can get married at whatever date they want. I just have a problem with this one because I feel like it came with bad intentions.", "NTA.

You obviously know your sister better than me, but at the same time you\u2019re only guessing and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in her head. Maybe she wants to be married before giving birth and doesn\u2019t want to show in her wedding dress. Maybe she\u2019s wanted to do this ASAP since learning of the pregnancy and has just been holding out to make sure the scans show the baby is healthy. Maybe she\u2019s just made a poor decision without much thought! There\u2019s no way to know and but you should try to give people the benefit of the doubt rather than assuming the worst.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing it because of the travel concerns, maybe a little bit assholish.

However, they were trying to get pregnant on purpose. Normally, if she had just told my parents she is getting married, they would have asked her to wait for mine.

If she had said the pregnancy was an accident, I would be more inclined to think that it wasn't about being married first.", "Those 2 days is property pto she'll need for her own wedding and wedding planning", "Well, she did mention that her pregnancy was planned, so I understand why they made their arrangements. However, it feels inconsiderate that she didn't inform me until the last moment. I can't justify spending over a thousand dollars to travel to a different continent and taking days off for someone who didn't bother to tell me earlier, especially since I'm planning my own wedding. My mother and I even suggested postponing her event to after mid-December (the date wasn\u2019t set yet when she told us) when we would have more availability, but she refused. So, I did try to accommodate.\n\nReflecting on her first engagement, I recall being heavily involved as one of her bridesmaids, from the beginning until it was called off. Since agreeing to be a bridesmaid this time, I haven\u2019t received any messages from her about helping with the preparations. The only update I got after her initial agreement was that her wedding was in two weeks. I understand your perspective, but I can't help feeling this situation reflects a pattern with my sister. For instance, I recently bought a car and only told my mom, but she ended up informing my sister. A month later, my sister, who doesn't even have a license, announced she was car shopping in our family group. It's disheartening; it seems like she's trying to keep up with my life rather than living her own. I do blame my parents for how things have turned out between us, but it is what it is. I hesitate to share details about my life because she either criticizes or imitates them. I may sound bitter, but I've been content doing things my way. \n\nI should also mention that she informed that her and husband will do a gender reveal the day after our wedding, and I just agreed even though we have other events following the wedding for some of our close friends and family.", "Expecting someone to fly to another continent that\u2019s an 8 hour flight so 10-12 hours of travel time with two weeks notice for a last minute wedding is a bit ridiculous. It\u2019s valid to push back on that and raises some yellow, if not red flags. You\u2019re talking at least a full day of travel when all is said and done a last minute PTO request and taking PTO OP likely didn\u2019t calculate for. \n\nIf I had a sibling do that, I\u2019d have concerns. If anything, I would try to make it work not necessarily so I could be a guest at their wedding but moreso out of concern for how fast everything is taking place.", "I get it. My response to her was, \"I would have loved to, but the next three weeks are extremely busy for me. If it weren't for that, I would have been happy to come.\" I didn't accuse her of being last-minute; I'm just explaining the situation to everyone here. Had I known a year or even a month in advance, I could have made arrangements.\n\nI recognize she had to make certain decisions, and I know pregnancy isn't easy. However, I must clarify that jealousy isn't a factor for me here. I feel you might have overlooked some aspects of the situation.", "Mechanical engineering. Why?", "This so much. The oldest sibling, especially the girl, ends up with so much expectations, restrictions and scrutiny. Her resenting you to the extent she is is weird for her.\n\n I\u2019m the oldest daughter, second oldest kid, and everything was put on me bc,\u201d you\u2019re the oldest girl, it\u2019s your responsibility to set the example, take care of everyone, help the parents.\u201d I got the harshest rules and punishments, the greatest expectations and my younger sisters could never do wrong, got to do things I wasn\u2019t even allowed to do, and I was constantly shamed where they were encouraged.\n\nYet despite all of that, I don\u2019t compete or resent my sisters. I celebrate their accomplishments, support them how I can when they need it. The one is very competitive with me and tries to knock me down any chance she gets, and as much as that sucks, I try to not let it get to me. Your sister is just miserable and that won\u2019t change. Don\u2019t let her centre your wedding around her pregnancy, bc she likely will even though she dropped out.", "Just tell her you regret that you can't attend this wedding but (if planned properly) you'll attend the next one.", "Funny enough, the first thing she said to me was how happy our dad was that he gets to have his first grandchild.", "Wow\nIt must REALLY be love at first sight and they must be absolute soulmates, to have a planned pregnancy 3 months into their relationship.  \n\nDon't stress about it, and be glad she's an 8 hour flight away.", "Thanks for providing context, from the way I read your explanation it on the OP it seemed like your sole given rationale for not going was that you could only attend for 2 days which doesn\u2019t seem a valid reason.\n\nYou\u2019ve given some more explanations here, but I\u2019d say that how good a rationale these are depends on context of the situation.\n\nYou mention money and fair enough for some people a thousand dollars on a plane ticket is a deal breaker, I know times in my life when I simply wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it and would have had to refuse to attend. However some people are well off and a thousand dollars isn\u2019t a significant spend.\n\nSimilarly you have your own wedding coming up and want to spend time organising it. I don\u2019t know if you have any hard to reschedule appointments booked or you\u2019ve fallen far behind schedule. Maybe missing these days is going to be a massive hinderance to your plan to get married and maybe you are in a good place and two days missed wouldn\u2019t make a significant difference.\n\nBoth the issues could be legitimate dealbreakers or could be fairly irrelevant and mere excuses depending on your situation, which I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe thing is you qualify your explanation with \u201cI can\u2019t justify\u2026 \u2026for someone who didn\u2019t bother to tell me earlier\u2026\u201d. So I read it as these aren\u2019t hard and fast issues for you and, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if you had to pay $1,000 and take time off work for some other reason (e.g different sister getting married with a reason for short notice you accepted as legitimate) you wouldn\u2019t have the same issue and would just pay the money and take the time off.\n\nSo assuming I\u2019m interpreting the above correctly, the fundamental issue is still just how annoyed you are at her for how she\u2019s planned this at short notice meaning you won\u2019t go to her wedding. If so, my previous comments still largely apply. She may be doing all these things for the reasons you think, but she may not be. Even if you\u2019re best places to make these guesses it\u2019s still guesswork and I think it comes down to \u201cYou won\u2019t attend your sisters wedding because your interpretation of her intentions, which may not be correct, has pissed you off\u201d.\n\nLike I said this is based on some assumptions and if for instance you simply can\u2019t afford to travel, etc then one of my assumptions if wrong, your position is fair and you\u2019re NTA as long as that\u2019s your reason for not going.", "Those could all be perfectly legitimate reasons.

If you had a post-wedding breakfast planned, then no shower on that day. It sounds like you didn't, so you don't care that she set the shower for that day. However, you may have been planning to leave on your honeymoon that day. You don't change your plans.

I am going to go the extra mile to show her that these things aren\u2019t on my radar, so she shouldn\u2019t worry. I am pretty sure if she has a boy, she will really hope ill also have a boy. If I have a girl, it would be the first grand daughter. Idk how she doesn\u2019t find this exhausting.", "Did you read the comment from OP that I responded to? She stated she isn't sure if other people are aware how long OP has actually known. That's why.", "If he was in on planning for the baby, I\u2019d say he\u2019s not a great guy either. I mean actively trying to have a baby within just a few months of dating is just crazy.", "Good luck & stay strong. The community of exhausted younger sibs has your back!", "If you can afford it, preemptively hire security that can handle her. If you have a wedding planner make sure that they know what is up so they can plan.  Or hire a wedding coordinator.", "The thought flitted through my mind of her announcing a baby shower/gender reveal for the same time as your ceremony. Based on the many reddits on this topic, expect chaos as her wedding gift.\n\nETA: small grammar edit.", "This makes a lot more sense to me. Good luck OP!", "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re replying to me. I agree that she has her own control over her attendance and said so. You might have meant it for someone else?", "My personal life definitely doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it. I am very close with my only sibling. I just have always tended to write a little more analytically which has always been an issue I work on. \n\nI understand the way you see it and can agree that it\u2019s possible. Not the conclusion I came to, but OP\u2019s reply to me does offer clearer context that points to your conclusion. \n\nI do believe that when relationships are hurting (as with OP and sister), over-sharing always damages further. There is lots of research behind this.", "I mean, you seem kinda bitter or at least judgy.", "[deleted]", "It most definitely will not.  \n\nBe thankful you live so far away since it will be easier to shield your future child from her envy.", "I get hoping for this, but... I wouldn't count on it.", "You're right in that she'll simmer down with you after the baby, but she will pout when everyone else's world isn't about being a new grandparent or aunt/uncle. So be prepared for that. \n\nWhen and if you decide to have children, I would continue not divulging much information but it may end up affecting what you share with your parents if they share with her. It sucks, but it's fantastic you can prepare and have some foresight.", "OP, unfortunately I can tell you that your sister isn't going to change. Been there, lived that.  Instead of participating in the one-upmanship competition I chose to live my life the best way possible. I have no regrets for not participating in that twisted little competition. Our now adult children are happy people.  Your future kids will follow your lead so just continue being a good person and those future kids will make their own decisions about what kind  of relationship they will have with their cousins.  It is very unlikely that getting married first and having a child first will satisfy your sister.  Narcissists dont suddenly stop and are never satisfied.", "I honestly think the only way to stop your kids to stop this cycle is for you to have excellent boundaries. Your sis seems toxic and keeping that away from your kids is the best way to keep them away from that petty negativity.", "Your sister really needs to grow up emotionally/mentally in her head. She sure doesn't sound all that mature.  Her rebound relationship adding in a planned pregnancy sounds narcissistic.  All of her competition moves towards you just shows how self-centered she is. Her need to control you & your life to some extent with these narcissistic power plays of being 1st in everything.  She must really dislike you that much.", "Cousins do not usually have the same competition that siblings do.  It will depends on how often you and your sister get together.\n\nHowever, you won't be be able stop your sister from comparing the cousins.  That will be on her.", "Thankfully ist she stays where she is you won't see her too often.", "she will live vicariously through that child.", "I doubt the sister is actually honest about who she is around him. She's more concerned about getting married and upping her sister. He's probably naive(or maybe just stupid) and just believes everything she says. Once the honeymoon phase falls he'll realize what a crazy he's stuck with.", "I concur with all of this. Was just going to say the same thing. OP, it's encouraging to hear your parents aren't easily distracted by your sister's antics. I'd also recommend password protection for all the important pieces like the venue, catering, and flowers. I almost forgot about the reception hall. Add it to the list. When you're dealing with the cray cray, paranoia is your best friend.", "I often find people with absolutes are speaking from some kind of experience, hence my comment.\n\nAs for the research, speaking to people with strained relationships I think it depends on the root. If withholding information as a form of exclusion is involved, adding more information is needed to find the right balance.", "How?", "!bot", "I agree with this, and I try to differentiate between each instance by using the words sharing versus over-sharing.", "NTA. I was about to say this whole feud was in your head until you said her gender reveal was scheduled for the DAY AFTER your wedding. Like holy what the hell?!? She's absolutely trying to upstage you for some weird reason. I would send an absolutely obnoxiously overdone wedding gift at this point, purely as a petty way of trying to upstage her. It'll also get everyone off your back that's calling you bitter. Is it petty and insincere? Sure, but so is blowing off your sister and bowing out of your wedding without even having a conversation.", "ZzZ-Z A Z2ZZ-zzZZz a 1", "NTA.  Congratulations on your wedding.  Works out well that she won't be at your wedding and the last thing you want is to waste your time and energy before your big day attending a meaningless wedding.  Based on your sister track record and the circumstances of her wedding, the marriage has a high probability of failure.", "NTA and don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll beat you to the divorce as well :)", "NTA.  Your sister gave you extremely short notice... send her flowers and a gift for congratulations and tell her you look forward to meeting her husband and the baby in the near future.  Quite honestly, your sister seems to be reacting to being dumped by her previous fiance and wants to prove to him that she has moved on with her life and make him feel like he meant nothing to her.  She is free to live her life and make her own mistakes.  The best you can do is wish her well and live your life making the right choices for you.", "Hmm. Speaking as a former golden child who realized later on how much it fucked up my sister - I am not surprised that she may have had an unplanned pregnancy and decided to immediately get married. Might not have had a lot to do with you. Also, it is true that you do hold her in some contempt - it is obvious through the post and I\u2019m sure your sister picks up on it as well. She might be overreacting to your rejection of the rsvp or might genuinely feel hurt. Point is, the short notice is ridiculous, even if she wants her kid to be born in wedlock. If you wanted to show her love and support as she prepares to have a child, ask if you can attend virtually and send her a thoughtful gift in lieu of your presence.", "She meant to get pregnant by a man she had only known for 3 months?! Yikes. \n\nAs for the rest NTA, people can just expect anyone and everyone to just be able to drop everything, book flights, hotels, miss work just to attend their wedding. She didn't allow you enough time. As for them saying you are jealous because she is getting married first kind of shows that that was the intent.", "NTA.\n\nThat's not enough time at all for you to put your life on hold, and the timing is suspect.  Also the last edit about her doing a party the day after your wedding cements it.", "NTA. The absolute best thing to do here is be as kind and supportive as possible (without going over the top) - or simply not to react at all. She wants a big dramatic reaction from you so she can respond in kind and is trying every tactic to get it. Nothing pisses off a narcissist more than not taking their bait.", "NTA.\n\nTwo weeks is not a sufficient amount of time to plan a trip that far. Get her an extra nice wedding gift, to quell any thoughts/rumors of you being bitter.", "NTA. I don't think it would change my judgment, but out of curiosity, would you attend if all the circumstances were the same but you had a lot of notice to get time off work?", "nta - you have your own family to worry about now, good luck and dont let people who dont deserve it drag you down.", "INFO: What are the odds she \u201cbaby trapped\u201d her fianc\u00e9e.", "NTA.  There's only one bitter person in this scenario, and it's not you.  13 days before the wedding is not a good time to ask someone to fly 16 hours to come.  Perhaps with more time or warning, you could have, but I can't imagine one of my people coming into my office and telling me this.", "NTA\nSounds like your sister didn\u2019t get the love and attention she needed growing up to form her own identity nad self worth. You don\u2019t owe her and can\u2019t fix her, I would plan to ignore her antics going forward and of course don\u2019t go!", "I think it\u2019s understandable to not go because of logistics as long as it\u2019s truly because of logistics. \nNot going honestly isn\u2019t a good look, not going to lie, but expecting you to plan a leave from work on such short notice and move around all you deadlines and scramble to find flights is unreasonable. \nYou\u2019re nta, but you have to understand how your \u201crefusal\u201d to go will look. It looks like you don\u2019t approve of the marriage, you aren\u2019t taking their union seriously, that you\u2019re completely dismissing her. And as the \u201cgolden child\u201d it makes it seem that you think you\u2019re better than her. \nI\u2019m not saying any of that is true, just how it could look. \n\nNTA for not going. \n\nHere\u2019s what I would do: get a really nice gift. A wedding gift AND a baby gift. Dispel any doubt that you do not take your sisters marriage and pregnancy seriously. Make sure you look genuinely sorry that you cannot make it. \nMake sure to look ab.so.lute.ly delighted for your sister. \nCall her on the day of and talk to her, hype her up, tell her she\u2019s glowing and shit", "NTA\n\nIt's a wedding. Not a summons.\n\nYou've got valid reasons for not going. Block your sister's friends. Since they're not your friend, they shouldn't have your contact information. If your sister is the one who gave it to them, I'd have harsh words for sister.", "NTA. I can empathize witb you.I was considered the golden child. I just didn't screw up as badly and make ridiculously poor life choices, I didn't have it easier she just thought I did. The competition on her part is borderline psychotic. You made the right choice. Congratulations on your wedding!", "NTA.\n\nWhat a sad way to live a life, in constant competition where none should exist. I feel sorry for your sister, because she'll never be happy with anything she has.", "Sister having her gender reveal the day after OP\u2019s wedding is trashy too.", "I agr\u00e9e. My parents did some damage, and I have talked to my parents and my sister to go to therapy separately or together. My parents don\u2019t see why using me as THE example could have fostered some insecurities and resentment in my sister. But", "Yeah, she didn\u2019t even ask me if I have anything planned, which I have, but she has already booked it. I also feel\nlike she will try to split our family into doing my event or her party. Meh, I\u2019m just so over her honestly speaking. She could have waited a week or even a few days before doing her party, and everyone who had traveled would have made it even if it was a week after the wedding.", "I love that your wife cut off your side of the family because they held racist views, meanwhile your wife held some pretty racist views of your country. \n\nHypocrisy at its finest.", "Thank you so much!!", "oooooooo i like this lol", "Sigh. It's just sad. Rushing into marriage is a good way to sign yourself up for a shitty relationship, so she's really not helping herself here.\n\nHopefully she starts to see she's just hurting herself and chills out one day, but I wouldn't hold my breath.", "Eugh, people are so good at screwing their kids over due to made up concepts. I hope you have a good relationship with your siblings now.", "I honestly think whoever wastes time on imagining this competition is a bit silly.", "Yes thanks.  My sister and I were always especially close even though we we\u2019re 10 years apart in age", "She scheduled a gender reveal the day after OP's wedding...she's not getting over anything and will wield her baby like the ultimate weapon, likely spending all her new free time at OP's wedding drawing attention to her \"first baby in the family\" \n\nOP is NTA, but this seems like someone who's made being in competition a habit."]}
