We didn\u2019t know what why he was sick and he stopped breathing and was put on a ventilator and was asleep for 2 weeks. I didn\u2019t know if he was going to pull through or not or if he would have long-term problems if he did come through.\n\nI only told our families and did not tell all of our friends.\nSome of his friends kept texting him and calling him so I had my brother in law tell my husband\u2019s friends that my husband was very sick.\n\nA bunch of them started calling and texting my husband, even though my husband was unresponsive and couldn\u2019t use his phone whatsoever. I do have access to my husbands phone, but I haven\u2019t read anything or looked through  anything. I\u2019ve been saving all of his messages and stuff for him to see when he gets better and can look at it himself.\n\nSo 2 days ago my husband started to wake back up, he\u2019s asked for his phone a few times and he started to click on messages. He just moves his fingers around and swipes. I saw messages between his friends calling me a b**** and saying to f*** me for not telling them right away. \n\nSome of these guys my husband used to be friendly with but now doesn\u2019t even talk to them. They got into a fight and said mean things about my husband and me and so he stopped hanging out with them. He left their softball and football leagues over it. My husband told me and his brothers so many times that he couldn\u2019t stand these guys and was happy to be rid of them. \n\nMy husband was in the ICU for 2 weeks. He can\u2019t have more than 2 visitors each day and his brothers swap out with me. He can\u2019t talk, and he\u2019s been unresponsive and just asleep on a ventilator with so many things hooked up to him. Now that he\u2019s waking up I asked if he wants visitors and he shook his head no. I asked about his friends and he still shook his head for a no.\n\nI still asked my husband if he wants them to come visit even though they have been so mean to me and he always shakes his head no but his friends don\u2019t believe me and think that I\u2019m lying and they\u2019re so angry that I didn\u2019t tell them right away what was going on even though my husband hasn\u2019t talked to them in months and don\u2019t want anything to do with them.\n\nAITA for not telling his friends he was in the hospital?\n\n(I know there are spelling mistakes but I\u2019m too tired to go fix all of them)", "created_utc": 1696393194, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zdhxj/aita_for_not_telling_my_husbands_friends_hes_in/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You had bigger things going on than to worry about his friends. Since he's still in the hospital, can't have many visitors, doesn't want visitors other than you and his brothers, you've done nothing wrong.", "I simply do not understand the whole concept of people coming out of the woodwork to visit someone who is in hospital. While i do understand the concern family/friends have for their loved one, it just baffles me. When someone is in hospital, its because they are very ill and need constant supervision. Vitals checked almost hourly, blood draws, meds, doctors coming and going, etc.  And people want to visit and stay for long periods of time.  Just staring at you.  Especially if you are unable to speak. You really arent getting much rest with everything going on, and then adding visitors on top of that.  A person tends to feel obligated to entertain their visitors instead of resting.  But no, people insist on visiting because reasons. Alway saying if there is anything we can do to help, yadda yadda.  And then, THEN when said person is released from hospital, all those people who \"cared\" so much are never to be found, when you truly might need something.\n\nMy spouse was recently in the hospital, cancer diagnosis, tumor removed(yay) will still need chemo though.  All sorts of people, family/friends came flooding in.  And while it made him happy to see such care, only one friend has remained diligent. Offering help and support.  This friend has been a huge help for us.  But all the family who showed concern have yet to reach out. Even just to ask how we are doing. It is very frustrating. And very telling of who some people truly are.  Yes these family/friends have their own lives to contend with, i get it, but dont offer support/comfort just because a loved one is in hospital. And then not reach out again.  It makes the ill person question if they ever really cared at all. Or if they are just showing concern because its 'the right thing to do' and it 'makes them feel good about themselves'.\n\nNTA and keep these people out of your life. Sounds like your hubs needs to send a group text to those \"friends\" and tell them to fuck off once and for all", "real friends stay out of this or kidnap the spouse for a spa day or something to get her some fresh air. NTA", "You are so not the asshole in this. You and your husband are going through a very traumatic time, and their feelings are not relevant right now. They have shown their true colours in their messages to your husband. Just focus on you both and ignore them. If they have your number, block them.", "YTA", "NTA. They've made your husbands hospitalisation about them. Fuck those guys.", "NTA. This was as much your private struggle as it was your husbands. Whatever you decide is right for you when going through something traumatic, is alright. Every person is different. Plus, logistically you knew no one could help anyways.\n\nWhen my father was in a coma, my mother was asking her community for prayers of support. One of my (estranged) uncles kept asking for specific details about interventions, surgeries, pictures etc. My mother wanted to keep these things private, and asked him simply to please pray if he wanted to support her.\n\nHe took it upon himself to bash our whole family on social media, saying it was inappropriate to ask for support if we weren't going to divulge every step of his care. He was quite poisonous and I blocked him immediately. \n\nYou aren't beholden to anyone but yourself and what you believed were your husband's wishes. I'm sorry that they caused you extra anxiety at this challenging time. I hope you can put them all out of your mind and focus on recovery with your husband. Sending good vibes your way", "NTA\n\nIf they were true friends, they could have reached out to you or your brother in law to ask if they could do anything to help out. When someone in the family is severely sick like that, all the energy in the family goes to taking care of that person. All the love, time, and support should be pouring in. Instead, OP and her BIL were the only ones who took care of her husband while these people couldn\u2019t take no for an answer. \n\nThe husband is right not to correspond to them and in the future when he is well enough, he might cut them out of his life. This is something OP should honor. I wish OP, her husband, and BIL good health and all the happiness in this life. Please take care of yourself, OP!", "You take care of yourself and your husband. Put them out of your mind for now. Let things cool down and let your husband deal with it later.", "NTA. The last thing you needed was his \"friends\" calling you over and over to check his progress with everything you were dealing with. They really showed their true colors and I hope when your husband is better he stands up for you. Frankly, it's not their business. When my husband was in a coma and on a ventilator I knew in my heart that he would not want people to come see him like that but they did anyway and when he got better he was pissed. I didn't tell them he was sick but they knew because he had an accident that was in the news. They can't go into the ICU here unless they were family. Several of them told the hospital they were related and the hospital called me to check if that was true. Total assholes. He was in a coma! He wouldn't even know they were there!", "Nta.
