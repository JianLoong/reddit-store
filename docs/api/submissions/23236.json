We also have a mutual understanding that we don't have to like each other, or share the same feelings, or try to avoid making people uncomfortable.

It's up to you to decide whether you want to play that game.", "NAH.  You guys just have different opinions about body art.  Any folks that say stupid stuff like \"you should lie to her\" are total idiots!  Don't tell lies to your partner!  Then you have to remember the lies, and it's not worth it!  She asked for your opinion, you gave it to her.  Has this topic never come up before today?  If you've talked about it, then your response should have been expected.  \n\nIf you don't like tattoos and she does, then it is a sizeable issue that can't be compromised on, however.

Don\u2019t listen to the NTA crowd on this. When it comes to situations like these, you are supposed to support your partner.

If you really like her, just ask her about it. Tell her that this isn't your thing, and you don't really have an opinion about it, but hers are ok. Some people put a lot of meaning in getting a tattoo and I think she just wants to reassure that it was a good idea.

I don't like his hair super short as I prefer it long but it's just hair so it's however he likes it etc. \n\nNTA because you weren't unkind you were just honest, and as long as she likes them you're entitled to be neutral about it.

Just because you're happy about something doesn't mean others are obligated to feel the same way. Opinions are always different. One can find it good, another can find it bad.

For someone who doesn't like tattoos in general, this isn't half bad a response.\n\n>\"The linework is great\" \"I love the color\"\n\nThat's not something I'd force someone who doesn't care about tattoos to say to make me happy. \"They look great\" can suffice, \"it's adorable\" is kind of pushing it but if they're generous to give that compliment, I don't see why not. Telling them to comment on specifics is forcing them to care, when they don't. You're gonna have a lot of things that you like that they don't, and vice versa. All they have to do is acknowledge that these things make you happy, which OP did. OP is NTA.", "If you constantly make nice and pretend that you love everything your partner does, that is not a healthy basis for a relationship.", "Exactly. How would he feel if he were clearly excited over something that was a big deal to him (ex: he beat a super tough video game, or started learning a new instrument, or cooked a challenging recipe), he went to share the news, and she just responded with \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d. Didn\u2019t acknowledge or validate his clear excitement at all. Obviously that would suck. People in these other replies have zero emotional intelligence. Jfc.\n\nPeople assume unfiltered honesty is a virtue 100% of the time and that\u2019s not always the case. 100% honesty isn\u2019t always called for or necessary. \n\nThere\u2019s a time and place for blatant honesty, and there\u2019s a time and place to just be supportive, let your partner enjoy their moment, and let it be.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSome of y\u2019all may benefit from learning about \u201cbids for connection\u201d - a term going by Dr. Gottman who has studied relationships for 40+ years.  https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/gottman-bids-for-connection\n\n\u201cWhen someone wants to connect with you, they rarely explicitly say \"Hey, I'd like to connect\" or \"Let's share a moment together.\" Instead, they'll use what are called \"bids for connection.\" A bid for connection is an action that tries to get your attention and indicates a desire for connection.\n\nThe important thing about bids for connection is that they all have a hidden message -- and the hidden message is \"I want to connect with you, so please give me your attention.\" When someone makes a bid for attention, they are looking for a positive response where you show interest in them.\n\nThe thing is, many people miss this hidden message, and the bids for connection go unanswered. Unfortunately, when you fail to answer a bid for connection, you send a hidden message of your own -- that you don't really want to connect with the other person.\u201d", "Well she needs to grow the fuck up and find a yes man then.", "This", "Right but an outfit you can change.

Like a thigh piece or a full arm? \n\nOf course, OP shouldn't be completely rude and say, \"I hate them!\" \nBut a neutral \"if you are happy, then that's what matters\" or other polite way of saying they dont hate it should be fine.", "Just ask her?\n\nI asked my wife, and we know these scenarios \ud83e\udd14", "There are a lot of incels on this thread.", "From a great height and in perfect English.", "Funny thing you say that. My gf is Chinese and she says the same thing. But ask any dutch person. \nThis is emotionally intelligent behavior for us. No hiding things, being direct, no beating around the bush, but just saying things as we see or feel or think, is emotionally intelligent. \n\nWe know exactly what the other person is thinking or feeling, so we know exactly where we stand. Things are way more clear and there is way more room to share opinions and thoughts without worrying about how the other person might feel about it. \n\nWe all have different thoughts and feelings, there is nothing special about them. So why would you care so much if someone else thinks or feels something different? You can still respect each other while expressing different thoughts and feelings. It's not so personal for us.", "I think so. Dutch culture sees honesty as a chance to help people, while American culture sees it as a way to hurt people. We still know when we should lie for the greater good, but we put greater value on our thoughts, and want people to understand them.", "It can be both. I've lived in the Netherlands for 6 years now and I've met some who were cold and brutal or just gave rude opinions unprompted. But I've also met a lot who were really kind or polite or positive when I could tell they didn't personally like something aesthetically. I think it really depends on the person and also how close to them you are. Dutch people, in my experience, tend to be a lot friendlier and caring when you have an established relationship or if you work together than if you are strangers or acquaintances. It also really varies based on location. Generally smaller more rural villages are way friendlier than the people you meet in Amsterdam.\n\n\nBut regardless if you compare it to America, people in NL do not fake being overly excited or happy all the time or fake their feelings in general. This may come across as cold in comparison. But it can also be really refreshing becuase it means if someone has an issue with you they will tell you and you can talk it out.", ">Dutch people I have met struck me as emotionally unintelligent? I had assumed a cultural difference,\n\nSo if you assume a cultural difference, why did they strike you as emotionally unintelligent? As the way emotional intelligence is expressed is highly culture specific, this assumption seems rather strange thing to me.", "So you think true honesty equates to lack of emotional intelligence? I think that says more about you than it does about Dutch people.", "But he said if you're happy with them, that's all that matters. Which is basically the same thing.", "That's not what I said at all.", ">People in these other replies have zero emotional intelligence. Jfc.\n\nOr they come from a country where that really just isn't done. In ours, it isn't. You ask for an opinion, you will get it.\n\nHow emotional intelligence is expressed depends on the culture.

But when he comes home from getting one done, and I can see that he\u2019s thrilled about it, I\u2019m genuinely happy for him that he likes it.

Something like, 'I'm not a tattoo guy, but they make you look radiant'. \n\nOr if you can't compliment at all, ask. \"Why did you choose this? Why that colour?\" Most of the time your partner wants you to feel interested.", "It's even so. \nWe consider it rude to not be honest with your thoughts and feelings. \nJust say things as they are.

It's a core component of improving in life.\n\nHow does it even work for you? You and your loved ones just tell each other \"it's great\" whatever the truth is all the time? Does that even feel good? I mean you know it doesn't mean anything.", "If he says \"Nice!\", he's lying.\nIf he says \"They'ok\", no one asked for his opinion.\n\nWhat the hell did she want by showing him her tattoos then?

Not to tell me something positive or neutral. \n\nIf someone was neutral, there is 100% I would say \"you didn't answer my question\". \n\nBut again, nothing wrong.

The one with the woman as the portrayed ah was deemed overall NTA and that the husband needed to understand her feelings and emotions.\n\nMeanwhile, swap the genders on the other post, and this entire sub was complaining that the man being posted as the ah was an absolute red flag of an asshole and should be dumped immediately.\n\nEdit found a link to the two identical posts https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/ha276u/aita_has_a_very_harmful_gender_double_standard/\n\nIt was about an apartment owner making their SO pay rent. According to this shit sub, making a woman pay rent is abusive and horrible and a red flag. Making a man pay rent is perfectly fine, he can afford it, you own the property you make the final say and if he doesn't like it he can leave.\n\nThis sub is so sexist it's borderline laughable\n\nDouble edit: unsurprisingly downvoted for sharing proof of this subs sexism.
