She ended up preferring \"boyish\" clothes and toys despite us having gone the traditional route, and we were more than happy to comply because honestly who the fuck cares.

She had asked for an astronaut figurine. The poor little thing acted all excited and thanked her grandparents, but when she was on her own as her mom put her to sleep, she pouted and asked if they couldn't find the astronaut at the store.\n\nI thought this was a deranged thing to do, and when she was finally asleep, although I didn't loose my cool, I didn't hold back and told both my parents that going against a 4 year old's wishes to score some kind of twisted political point was insane and that they both should either change or have their grand daughter resent them down the line. They acted like they had no idea what I was talking about and that I was \"reading into it\", \"look at how excited she was\" they said. So I had to double down as I felt they were trying to gaslight me, we argued for around 10 minutes, nothing got too heated but things got visibly tense.\n\nAs we went back home the next day, my wife said she thought I was overreacting. She agrees with me 100% but she thinks I should have had that discussion in private, not in front of the entire extended family (around 15 people).

It's not about sparing their feelings, its about knowing how to handle situations like this. What OP should have done was have this conversation with the grandparents privately and ask if they had gift receipts.", "Most people in the world are trying to push an agenda.\n A girly gift doesn\u2019t necessarily is going to affect the mental health of the child, if the parents take the time to explain their daughter  that the gift is just to play. I don\u2019t see any harm in receiving a doll o whatever girly gift the kid received.\n\nEdit:\nAnd I\u2019m NOT saying he is an AH.", "If a family member kept buying someone on the heavier side something three times to small would you say the same thing?", "I mean it\u2019s obviously not about the gift. The grandparents have an issue with the kid not wanting to conform to gender roles and that is something that could be damaging if the parents don\u2019t step in at some point. The gift itself isn\u2019t the issue it\u2019s just a symptom of a bigger issue that needs to be addressed if the grandparents want a good relationship with the kid.", "Been there already, many times, but I don\u2019t complicate my life or my sons over a gift. You can always choose what to do and what to say, for example \u201cthanks but you can keep your toys, I won\u2019t accept anything that my daughter doesn\u2019t like and also that means that we are not welcome here anymore because you don\u2019t accept my daughter and/or treat her right\u201d. Then explain it to your daughter the reason of your decision.", "Eh, more likely they just don't get it more than anything else. At one point years ago my grandma suggested buying someone an ABBA CD for her birthday because that's what she thought young people were into. This was in 2008 mind you. She wasn't ill intentioned, she just didn't really get it.", "I understand that, and believe me I had to deal  with things like that too. I did have many problems with my parents, because they were old school, but at the same time I talked to my son, so he could understand that not because someone have different point of view, doesn\u2019t mean he is not love or he is wrong. For example my father used to fight with me if he saw my son helping me doing house chores like laundry or washing dishes, because that was a women\u2019s job. Instead of taking things to the extreme, and create confrontation, I taught him to be confident and comfortable with himself and see other people opinions like just words."]}
