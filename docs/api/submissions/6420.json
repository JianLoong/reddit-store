She had asked for an astronaut figurine. The poor little thing acted all excited and thanked her grandparents, but when she was on her own as her mom put her to sleep, she pouted and asked if they couldn't find the astronaut at the store.\n\nI thought this was a deranged thing to do, and when she was finally asleep, although I didn't loose my cool, I didn't hold back and told both my parents that going against a 4 year old's wishes to score some kind of twisted political point was insane and that they both should either change or have their grand daughter resent them down the line. They acted like they had no idea what I was talking about and that I was \"reading into it\", \"look at how excited she was\" they said. So I had to double down as I felt they were trying to gaslight me, we argued for around 10 minutes, nothing got too heated but things got visibly tense.\n\nAs we went back home the next day, my wife said she thought I was overreacting. She agrees with me 100% but she thinks I should have had that discussion in private, not in front of the entire extended family (around 15 people).

I will say I think this still should have been handled privately if possible.  That said, it's nice to see a young person feeling strong enough to speak up for their convictions and for their children, in looking back at how important boundaries are, maybe my mom wouldn't do the things she does now had I spoken up more when younger.\n\nI was raised very religious, as a young adult and then as older adult, went from a faith crisis to where I find myself now- I would classify myself as Diest.   Of course to my moms chagrin, no matter how many times I've told her my beliefs are different than her, she will NOT stop hounding the issue.  We are 100pct polar opposite on political/religious issues, but there are other things in life outside of that, and most times we find common ground and she is a very support and loving mother, and was always selfless, giving and caring/warm mother (as was my dad, RIP).  I adore her, love her fiercely and she has been my best friend in adulthood, and like any close relationship, it's not perfect, but there are times I would be more firm.\n\nMy oldest adult son has some pretty big mental health issues, of course to my mom it's all 'spiritual bondage.   She knows religion is a HUGE trigger for him, She is a very loving, super sweet grandmother and mother, a beautiful person, she is also almost 80 and DOES have huge memory issues, I keep pressing her to get herself tested as I believe she is showing signs of mild dementia.  She forgets things a lot, but I do NOT think she has forgotten my beliefs or his (or lack of)- \n\nCome Christmas she gave us some really thoughtful gifts (we aren't well off but they were cute things)-but ALONGSIDE this, she gave both sons a booklet about 'boys and prayer' -sort of a devotional type thing- my youngest could care less and likely just put it in a drawer to be forgotten.   In mine there were also several booklets on prayer/devotional, about 5 total...I'm not going to lie, it triggered ME bad and made me very angry, was just unwanted and aggravating, as so many in Christianity have this fervor of forcing belief down your throat, regardless of your resistance or repeated reminders.    My son, who already is on the very edge these days, got royally pissed, took it outside, cussed and started burning it and went on ranting for hours.  I felt furious, because she should have known better and then mad at myself, because I saw what was in my bag, I likely should have glanced at his before handing it to him (my mom was sick so I had picked them up while delivering mine to her).   \n\nDid I say anything to her?  Nope, I didn't- I might still, but honestly?  At her age, given how she was raised, I don't expect it will do anything but distress her, and I don't think it's worth to keep reminding her of my lack of faith.   She even asked if boys liked their gifts....here is where I  went wrong, I didn't confront her like the OP did.   I should have been honest...but my thought was, would it have helped? Not likely,....she would have still chalked it about to evil spirits instead of it being about her lack of respect.  \n\nLONG winded and tangent of my own, sorry- but here' the thing OP- you have a 5yr old, you have YEARS in front of you to deal with this, so if you don't nip it now, you will be me in a couple decades and by then, your parents age will come into play and strong boundaries can be seen as hostile, especially if their brain starts aging, kwim?   It was a harsh display in front of others, but if you HAVE been this direct privately, then maybe shunning will help?   It's risky,  but also worth it if it makes them change their ways and treat her respectfully for who she is and what she likes/dislikes/believes, etc.  \n\nI commend you.  I think it's also just as important to continue teaching your daughter to be gracious when given gifts, and shelter her like you did and stand up for her.  If there is anything that annoys me more than forced religion, is ungrateful kids/that turn into ungrateful adults regarding gifts.

You should set a boundary.  If this girly gift situation happens again, it will be your last Christmas visit with them.  Then stick to it.", "You've set the story up to paint your parents as right wing nutjobs, so everyone on reddit will of course automatically say NTA. But i think your GF is right, you didn't need to go off on them in front of the entire family. YTA.", "I was just like her. It is called a Tom boy in my day. Just because she prefers it more now doesn\u2019t mean it will always be. I am now a fashionista Diva. All girl and proud of it. The parents are supportive of their child. Just because now she is like this doesn\u2019t mean she is going to be like this later in life. BUT if she is she should be supported by family not BULLIED IN TO SOMEONE SHE NOT.", "Your reply is spot on, and so are the other YTA replies I read that were downvoted (I didn't read them all). \n\nIf this little girl wanted the doll and dress, but the grandparents bought her the astronaut figurine, would the father have argued with the grandparents then?", "My sister didn\u2019t like dolls or dresses either.  She would rather be outside playing.  She is grown now married with three kids and still hated dresses.  She also enjoys going hunting with her husband. Her oldest is a girl who did like to play with dolls and wear pretty dresses.  My sister always got her stuff that my niece would like.", "It\u2019s a little pedantic and weird to put *that* much weight into *one* gift for a little 5 year old child. \n\nBut yes, you bring up a good point- the underlying sexism in OP- that if the situation was reversed (and she wanted girly stuff but they got her an astronaut) would he still have such a volatile reaction? \n\nThe entitlement and tantrum behavior over a *gift* is just gross", "Was that it? The matchbox cars? I thought it was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle toy I HAD to have...

Women have been going to space for a long while now.", "Your post made me think of a former neighbor.

I really hope you can return the Barbie toy and get her an astronaut figure or whatever she wants!  Also, Sally Ride went to space in 1983.  Girls can want to be astronauts too!

NTA. Thank you for standing up for her.  Please make sure that you find her that astronaut, it sounds cool!", "NTA. \n\nI have two 7yo granddaughters (they are cousins) \n\nOne is obsessed with Batman.  Batman winter jacket/ hat/mittens.  Batman t shirts and pajamas.  Jeans and shorts type of girl.  Batman toys galore. Is easy to buy for her because she is happy with anything Batman.  \n\nMy other granddaughter is very girly girl.  The Barbies and LOL dolls/accessories.  The Princess dresses.  She refused to wear anything but dresses (with leggings when it was cold). She likes the bracelets/ rings and makeup.  She likes perusing Amazon for clothes (and has very good taste) She didn't own a pair of jeans until last year...refusing to wear jeans before.  She's obsessed with Squishmallows.  \n\nNo one says anything about the granddaughter who loves Batman.  My daughter who has the girl who likes girly things gets all kind of flack  for 'pushing stereotypical girly visions on her daughter'. My daughter isn't pushing anything... it's what my granddaughter enjoys. Some girls like Batman and some like dresses and jewelry.", "NTA. And it needed to be said in front of everyone. Your wife taking the go along to get along stance is only enabling your parents behavior. Wifey needs to step out of this and get on board, or your daughter will not only resent your parents, but her as well.\n\nAmy needs to see both parents fully supporting and defending her. You parents need to pull their arses out of the 1800s and understand that kids today are allowed and encouraged to be who they truly are. Which means not forced into some archaic gender role.", "NTA. Yeesh, little girls can like astronauts and prefer pants to dresses. What is this, the 50s?", "NTA. You\u2019re a great dad and keep sticking up for your kid.", "NTA. I never liked girly things, and made this very clear with my parents. For the most part, they respected this, but when they didn't, it was extremely frustrating.", "NTA my Petty self would have asked them in front of 15 people why they do not love their granddaughter?. But then again I'm a great big meanie with no patience for BS.", "NTA, I think it\u2019s disrespectful for people to buy stuff for my children that aren\u2019t on their wish lists or that they haven\u2019t conferred with me about. Mainly because they have so much and the clutter gets overwhelming despite constantly purging. \nAlso, my daughter is very vocal and I usually let her say things like \u201cmom I already have this\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like this\u201d in front of the person who gives her the gift. Don\u2019t give gifts just to fulfill your own desire of giving because that\u2019s just selfish. Give gifts that the child will utilize and adore. Which means, honoring their requests, likes/dislikes. Nobody needs to be grateful for bullshit gifts. I applaud this!!!", "Your parents are sexist homophobic transphobic bigots. Hard stop.\n\nAnd they deserved to be called out in public. NTA", "NTA.  Yes why not air the dirty laundry in front of family?  They won\u2019t accept Amy\u2019s likes, bought her gifts they want her to like.  Go get your daughter her astronaut and return the Barbie crap.   I played with GI Joe dolls and wore jeans and a baseball cap when I was her age.   Means absolutely nothing.  I wear dresses as an adult.  No issue.", "So I was that girl. Make up and girly girl stuff was always being pushed on me. I was never allowed to explore it in my own time. It got to the point i was so sick of what I wanted being pushed aside and their ideas of what i should be like shoved down my throat that I chose the route that made everyone unhappy and was stubborn as a fuckin mule about it. If i was going to be unhappy about what i was wearing then so the fuck were they. \n\nMy dad even encouraged the \"boy\" interests but still wanted me to be girly on top of it. I was a little different though when it comes to clothes. If anyone had bothered to treat me like my own person and ASK they'd find out I was self conscious due to the fact that i was growing way faster than my friends. I was the tallest or 2nd tallest until high school. I physically couldn't fit into the clothes my friends wore. I always had to shop an age group above which had way different styles and lower cuts even though I was 12. \n\nIf my likes and interests and clothing choices had been respected I would have explored girly things sooner. But because they shoved it down my throat it wasn't until college that i got into dresses and skirts. Though I still struggle to find stuff that fits i have half a closet of them! I also didn't get into make up until the pandemic started. Turns out i do like some of that girly stuff they just didn't let me explore it on my own and made me hate and resent it from it being forced.\n\nIf they would back off and wait maybe she will have an interest. But even if she doesnt gain an interest that's their grandbaby, they should back off because her happiness should be more important then their idea of what she should be. That's like the coolest part about kids. They're a whole person and are unique. You all get the pleasure of finding out who she is as a person first hand but they won't if they try to force her to be someone else.", "NTA for fending for your daughter. i guess in terms of 'dirty laundry' the gifts were more of a final straw than an issue in itself, but i don't blame you for grilling your parents. \n\nnow your daughter has to think older/elderly people don't know things, as is evident by her comment that they couldn't find the astronaut. that's what i would have gotten out of it when small too, grandma and grandpa don't get it. you can't trick kids lol. maybe telling your parents your kid thinks they're clueless would help your cause", "NTA. Their granddaughter literally told them \"I don't want dolls\" and they didn't care so they bought a barbie. Your daughter pretended to like me so she wouldn't make a scene (Which is mature for her age), and they had the nerve to say \"But she liked her present!\"", "NTA  \n\n\nbut now you know they want her true reaction next time this happens let your daughter know to be truthfull over polite", "NTA. As an adult woman who received many unwanted (and frankly creepy af) baby dolls as gifts growing up, thank you for standing up for your daughter.", "I understand wife\u2019s pov but OP does exactly the right thing - showing a clear message to everyone that he has his kid\u2019s back and not to pull stunts like that NTA", "NTA\n\n\"...urban parenting....\"  That's a new one, for me.  I like it!", "NTA. But you should tell your daughter not to put on a show for them next year. If she doesn\u2019t like what they get her, let her be honest about it.", "YTA your child had the grace to fake enough husiasm. This was a talk to have alone with the parents.

They could have easily found a middle ground and given her [this astronaut Barbie](http://Sally Ride BARBIE Inspiring Women Doll https://a.co/d/bjkYP26) and some accessories that *they* wanted, to give her the option to dress her \"girl,\" but instead they want to force their worldview onto your daughter.", "What really saddens me about this is this very young child has already had to figure this out. That she already knows from past experience that she has to react to certain way to feel included in her family. Not her nuclear family of course her parents rock specially dad. I will never understand people who won't allow other people to simply be who they are no matter the age.", "I find burning those types of things to be quite carthartic", "So insanely true. What you choose to enjoy as a child has no wearing on what you will be like as an adult. They were purposefully being jerks and she will remember her parents allowing her to freely express herself. She will also remember how hurtful her grandparents actions were. \n\n\nI was the biggest tomboy. Loved soccer, playing in the dirt, and baggy clothes that I look back and think wtf was I wearing. Now I\u2019m the exact opposite. Super girly, wear nothing but dresses, always fashionable. Let the girl enjoy herself!", "This. It needs more upvotes. \n\nI never liked dolls. I never liked pink dresses (although I proudly wear a pink hard hat now) I'm a female construction manager who most certainly is all girl. And I have a kick ass job because my family understood and supported me.", "For real. This is not the 1950s. Girls are allowed to like 'boy things' these days.

You got it perfectly!", "My niece was hyped about the chicken soup box she unwrapped this year, but even more hyped once she realized it wasn't actually chicken soup inside.
