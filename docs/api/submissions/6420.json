To be clear even though we could have raised Amy in a gender neutral fashion, we didn't. She ended up preferring \"boyish\" clothes and toys despite us having gone the traditional route, and we were more than happy to comply because honestly who the fuck cares.

She had asked for an astronaut figurine. The poor little thing acted all excited and thanked her grandparents, but when she was on her own as her mom put her to sleep, she pouted and asked if they couldn't find the astronaut at the store.\n\nI thought this was a deranged thing to do, and when she was finally asleep, although I didn't loose my cool, I didn't hold back and told both my parents that going against a 4 year old's wishes to score some kind of twisted political point was insane and that they both should either change or have their grand daughter resent them down the line. They acted like they had no idea what I was talking about and that I was \"reading into it\", \"look at how excited she was\" they said. So I had to double down as I felt they were trying to gaslight me, we argued for around 10 minutes, nothing got too heated but things got visibly tense.\n\nAs we went back home the next day, my wife said she thought I was overreacting. She agrees with me 100% but she thinks I should have had that discussion in private, not in front of the entire extended family (around 15 people).

I don\u2019t see any harm in receiving a doll o whatever girly gift the kid received.\n\nEdit:\nAnd I\u2019m NOT saying he is an AH.", "If a family member kept buying someone on the heavier side something three times to small would you say the same thing?", "I mean it\u2019s obviously not about the gift. The grandparents have an issue with the kid not wanting to conform to gender roles and that is something that could be damaging if the parents don\u2019t step in at some point. The gift itself isn\u2019t the issue it\u2019s just a symptom of a bigger issue that needs to be addressed if the grandparents want a good relationship with the kid.", "Been there already, many times, but I don\u2019t complicate my life or my sons over a gift. You can always choose what to do and what to say, for example \u201cthanks but you can keep your toys, I won\u2019t accept anything that my daughter doesn\u2019t like and also that means that we are not welcome here anymore because you don\u2019t accept my daughter and/or treat her right\u201d. Then explain it to your daughter the reason of your decision.", "Eh, more likely they just don't get it more than anything else. At one point years ago my grandma suggested buying someone an ABBA CD for her birthday because that's what she thought young people were into. This was in 2008 mind you. She wasn't ill intentioned, she just didn't really get it.", "I understand that, and believe me I had to deal  with things like that too. I did have many problems with my parents, because they were old school, but at the same time I talked to my son, so he could understand that not because someone have different point of view, doesn\u2019t mean he is not love or he is wrong. For example my father used to fight with me if he saw my son helping me doing house chores like laundry or washing dishes, because that was a women\u2019s job. Instead of taking things to the extreme, and create confrontation, I taught him to be confident and comfortable with himself and see other people opinions like just words.", "poor lil thing and at the age of five pretending to be excited so she didnt hurt her grandparents feelings! its amazing how mature she was about this situation!!!  \n\nsomeone needs to get this girl the astronaut figurine and im happy to do it just to make her smile again!", "NTA. Your daughter is already better raised and more polite than her grandparents.", "You\u2019re a wonderful dad. Never change.\n\nNothing wrong with having done this in front of others either: they\u2019re all on notice now too. \n\nNTA", "NTA Return the girly stuff and get the astronaut she wanted. Make sure your parents know", "NTA I can still remember how upset I was when I got a pink bedroom when I asked for blue because blue is for boys. Next time it was decorated they did it blue", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for your daughter. Hell I wish my parents were even a little bit like you. In front of relatives? Even better. Shows you aren't messing around and it is very important to you and your family.", "YTA for criticizing a gift. That is just rude, period. If you don\u2019t like the gift, exchange it for something else.", "YTA - for inflicting drama on a bunch of innocent people.

It did not need to be in surround sound", "YTA. You didn't need to cause a scene in front of everyone.\n\nPlus, I gotta call some kind of bullshit here:\n         \"The poor little thing acted all excited and thanked her grandparents, but when she was on her own as her mom put her to sleep, she pouted and asked if they couldn't find the astronaut at the store.\"  No way a 4-year-old would do this.", "ESH, it was an asshole move to do that in front of everyone and your daughter will get over not getting what she wanted so long as you don't teach her to be spoiled.", "ESH\n\nThis was a private conversation, your wife was right there.\n\nYour parents suck for not respecting your daughter's preferences and trying to push their gender stereotypes on her.  A MAKEOVER Kit for a 5 yr old is stupid(in my opinion). \n\nI did want a pink ballerina costume for Halloween when I was a little kid(probably because the tutus only came in pink), but in general wasn't fond of pink--many girls aren't.  You parents shouldn't try to force that on her either.  \n\nIf you can afford it.  Let her decide what she wants to do with them(donate, regift).  Then offer her the choice of an alternate option.  Can you get her the astronaut?  Let her pick out an outfit she likes?\n\nIf parents can't respect the boundaries you have set.  Celebrate Christmas at home.  Maybe even make a game of opening Granny/Grandpa's gift.  What color will something be?  Let her know that she should thank someone for giving a gift, but also teach her she has the right to not want or need what she is given.  \n\nI know that is a fine distinction for a 5 yr old(most adults still have problems with it).", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m 38 and have a 1 year old boy - we\u2019re going through some similar things with my parents right now. We went with a woodland themed nursery and generally didn\u2019t care about getting lots of blue things for him when he was an infant. Everything we get from them is some other random animal - penguins, giraffes, a goose. They also only get baby blue clothes / blankets. \n\nThis we the first birthday and really the first Christmas as well - ended up with a giant, baby blue elephant rocker and a giraffe chair. I was so angry - they had marked items off our wishlist that were also similar so others wouldn\u2019t get them for our kid. \n\nThey did a lot of that to me too - I often got random shot that was close to what I wanted, but not the actual thing. It got worse when I got older and they would ask me for a list of things or to come up with what I want to do for my birthday and we\u2019d not do them. I hate celebrations because of them. \n\nAnyway - not sure if you had something similar in your own past that brings up up bad feelings from your own past. We\u2019re not sharing with my family the list of things that my kid would be really excited about because I don\u2019t want him to have that disappointment. We\u2019ll return anything that he doesn\u2019t like and we\u2019ll move on.", "NTA. The only people \u201cimposing\u201d their views on a kid are your parents.", "NTA. because the message of \u201crespect amy\u201d needs to be said in front of the whole family.", "NTA.\nWhen I was a little girl I didn't care for dolls, I much preferred the stuff my older brother got. My extended family knew this and still always got me Barbies and balet stuff for Christmas. It just made me sad to get stuff I had zero interest in. It didn't occur to me at the time that my relatives just disapproved of it.", "Honestly, if your parents do not want to buy her \"boy\" toys it's their right not to do so. You should make a Christmas list not inclusive of everything she wants but things you think your parents might like to get her. \n\nThere are books for her age range about Mae Jemison and other female astronauts, as well as people like Amelia Earhart. It show is your daughter that space and Science aren't just a \"boy\" thing - she can find women to model after too and they're even dolls and action figures (you said she doesn't like dolls but some are more action figurine or they can be used to role play unlike baby dolls)\n\nYou said she loves her oven kit. Maybe some kid friendly cookbooks and baking mixes, etc would be something that she would love and your parents would also love to gift her. Both my nieces and nephews like getting gingerbread houses and cookie cutters and stuff.\n\nNo one is entitled to getting a gift. It's all voluntary\n\nAlso most people I have met that are trying to raise their kids gender-neutral are absolutely not doing that. They are strongly introducing and making available toys that are typically for the opposite gender and do not introduce toys that are traditionally liked by their own gender or they don't represent their gender and their child's interests. For example if a girl is interested in trucks for muscle cars and they only show them examples of men Instead of showing them shows where women are doing the same thing and are successful at it.", "Nta, my son is also turning 5 this month and he prefers \"girly\" stuff. They are small children. I'm sorry your parents are being weird about your LO's interests. Maybe time to reduce contact.", "NTA.\n\n**You need to teach your daughter not to hid her feelings from people (grandparents).**\n\nShe needs to say Thank you, but also let them know that the present isn\u2019t what she asked for(maybe give them a list of 4-5 items to choose from for birthdays or Christmas).Maybe she can ask them if we (grandparents and her) can take it back to the store so she can exchange it.\n\nI think when your parents see that she truly doesn\u2019t care for girly things, they may back off, it just may take some time.\n\nGood Luck.", "Yta - you absolutely should have talked to them in private - your kid showed better manners than you. \nThey are also AH\u2019s for buying her something she specifically said she didn\u2019t want.", "OP's daughter is a polite little girl- in the moment she feigned enthusiasm and thanked her grandparents for the gift which is the kind thing to do. I did it all the time as a kid. My cousin and i were gifted dora the explorer dolls by an aunt when we were in like middle school. We smiled and said thank you. And later grandma pulled us aside and said that she could donate them for us.", "Tbh why does it need to be called a \"tom boy\" or \"not a girl thing\"? What makes space and cars not girl things? Ridiculous to label it like that to start with.", "I agree with your first two paragraphs, but that should apply to people you haven't had conversations with about appropriate gifts.\n\nI'd disagree about them winning nothing by humiliating the gift giver in this case. I think a lot of time, people with crappy behavior continue with it because there isn't anyone else to judge them besides the people they are offending, who they often think are wrong anyway. OP had multiple conversations with the grandparents and were blatantly ignored. It's time to make a public fuss and hope the embarrassment will make them think twice about their actions, cause nothing else has.\nNTA", "Your grandparents are apples and oranges compared to coworkers and other one-off gift givers.", "She's not \"acting like a boy\", she's acting like a girl who likes space and cars.", "Also, tell your wife, OP, that your parents gave her daughter a gift they knew she didn't want in front of 15 people, so discussing it in front of 15 people was the equal response.\n\nMy suggestion for the future is that you have a back-up present in the car, as these two old people sound catty AF.  You have your daughter send a thank-you note that following week, in it stating she  felt very good about her decision to donate the gift to the local battered women's shelter or homeless shelter that takes kids.", "oh jesus", "Yeah. Geez, they could have at least bought her Astronaut Barbie or an astronaut teddy bear\ud83e\uddf8, something that she might like.", "Absolutely do not have a \u201cbackup present\u201d. That will mislead Amy to misunderstand what her gramps are like, leading up to a likely bigger heartbreak down the road.\n\nOP just needs to be sure to give good presents themselves, and praise Amy for being polite on being given a bad gift (remarkably gracious for her age!)", "You can just call me Klutzy, no need to be formal.", "But the grandparents were explicitly told, several times, that these are things that the child *does not* like. It was on them for choosing to ignore that. It wasn\u2019t a misunderstanding, it was willful ignorance at best and trying to impose their ideals onto a child at worst."]}
