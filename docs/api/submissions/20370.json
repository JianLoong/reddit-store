Emma, her boyfriend and two other couples were present which we are close to also. As a housewarming gift, we brought a nice bouquet and vase for their console and a photo frame so they could frame a nice photo for their living/dining space. I know Emma's boyfriend the least out of the 4 of us partners and I know he likes whiskey so I brought a bottle to make an effort to show that I am interested in getting to know him. I met Emma through Charlotte and she's always saying we should do double dates but I just didn't know Matt that well that I felt comfortable agreeing.\n\nThe event came and it was great. Emma and Matt are great cooks and hosts and their new house is nice. We gave them the flowers and photo frame and they loved them. I didn't show them the whiskey but said I brought something nice to cap the night off for after dinner and they seemed receptive.\n\nAfter food when we were all sat in front of the fireplace, I presented the bottle of whiskey and said that it would be nice to have a toast. We all had a drink apart from Matt which I thought was strange because he's said that he likes whiskey before. Then, when I went to top up after a while and ask if anyone else wanted a drink, Matt spoke on behalf of everyone saying that it was alright, took the bottle from me and placed it on their console. Before I could say anything, Emma cracked open a bottle of wine instead. Something felt weird to me but I did enjoy the rest of the night talking with everyone.\n\nToday, I crafted a message to send to Matt about the bottle of whiskey (\"Hey would it be okay if I stopped by and picked up the whiskey bottle, I think I forgot to take it with me lol\") and got Charlotte to read it and see if it sounded okay. \n\nShe was confused since she thought we were gifting the bottle of whiskey (even though I paid for it fully and we split the cost of the flowers and frame between us). I said that we weren't and if we were, I would have brought it and gave it alongside the flowers and photo frame. She asked if we could just leave it because my message sounded awkward and she felt it made us look cheap asking for it back. I disagreed because if anything, they look like the cheap ones letting us only have a drink each before taking the bottle right from my hands. She said that because we brought it to this event, it looks like a gift anyway and I would be a dick to ask for it back. \n\nWIBTA to send the message anyway? I don't think it comes across as a gift and if I were to have brought it as a gift, I sure as hell wouldn't have spent \u00a3180 for something I would have 1 drink of.\n\nUPDATE - I didn't send the text, Emma and Matt swung by with the bottle and apologised for talking over me last night. I apologised for deciding to serve the whiskey and taking control when it was their housewarming.

It looks tacky.", ">WIBTA to send the message anyway?\n\nYWBTA, this is a relationship you're both in, but more to the point her best friend. She doesn't want you to send it, doing so without her knowledge, or consent, would in fact make you an asshole.\n\n>because my message sounded awkward and she felt it made us look cheap asking for it back.\n\nShe is correct, you would be perceived as tacky and cheap, and just flat out weird.\n\nIt's a lot of money, but, that's on you. It was meant to be consumed, and wasn't, consider it consumed and move on.\n\nHere's a question to ask yourself. What if only three of you had some whiskey, leaving the vast majority of the bottle resting. Would you have taken it home?\n\nNo one takes party drinks home. If you were concerned about the money you should have gotten a less expensive toast.", "YTA\n\nIt was brought as part of the celebration. It's sooooo tacky and rude to take it back. Definitely not within normal guest etiquette.", "Yes, you gifted the whiskey, it's very weird to bring a bottle of alcohol and just take it with you if it's not all consumed. You're in your 30s, not 22. Once you left it there, you DEFINITELY gifted it and asking for it back looks very pathetic and cheap. Are you having financial/alcohol problems? You seem concerned that you all apparently didn't just kill a whole bottle of whiskey at the end of the night and that the guy who apparently (based on second-hand info) likes whiskey was not feeling any at that moment? FWIW, it was a bit rude to commandeer the events as far as pouring whiskey around in the first place, as they are the hosts and the hosts serve generally. \n\nSeriously.. let it go. Do not bring an alcohol bottle to a housewarming and expect to finish it or walk home with it. Once you've left something that can be perceived as a gift at someone's house do NOT ask for it back. Your gf would be mortified if this is your intro to her best friend's husband. \n\nSorry about the \u00a3180, but move on. Let them think you are extremely generous and not a drunk cheapskate.", "YWBTA \n\nUnfortunately, this is an expensive lesson of where etiquette and perception collide. I would bet that everybody there thought the bottle was part of the gift. And I would probably have seen the timing of it as just part of the presentation.\n\nAnd even though you brought it with more of a potluck mindset, if a bottle of something one brings gets opened, it's pretty common to leave it with the hosts.", "YTA. Uh\u2026is this your first time being invited to someone\u2019s home for dinner, ever? If you bring something it is for the hosts. They decide if/when to serve it and they definitely don\u2019t give it back after. If you\u2019re wondering what the weird vibe was, it was strange for you to open and serve the whiskey instead of giving it to them when you arrived and allowing them to do so if they wanted to. They had clearly planned on serving wine after dinner.\n\nYou sound like Frank Costanza stealing back the marble rye, and if you don\u2019t get that reference just know that it\u2019s not a flattering comparison.", "YWBTA\n\nWhatever your intent was, it\u2019s really cheap and tacky to ask for the rest of the whiskey. And, if that\u2019s your inroad to being friendly with this couple (if it\u2019s something you still want to pursue), asking for it is probably going to close that door. It\u2019s generally assumed that when one brings a bottle of liquor to another\u2019s home that the liquor stays.\n\nIt\u2019s best to be direct: \u201cI wanted everyone to have a taste of my favorite whiskey before the boys and I polish it off during Saturday\u2019s golf scramble,\u201d or something. But to say you brought something nice for later, well, all that really does is imply you\u2019ve brought a nightcap, and generally in these events, that would remain with the hosts. The only time I\u2019ve seen alcohol taken home is if the hosts request it leave with someone. Otherwise, I\u2019ve always known and approached bringing drinks as \u201cthey only cross the threshold once.\u201d", "I read this once and moved on as everyone covered the answer pretty well. YTA. You bring something perishable to an adult dinner it\u2019s theirs now. On thinking further it sounds like everyone was desperate for you to not drink anymore. And you are very fixated on how much was left. Maybe you have a bigger problem then being the AH for wanting the bottle back\u2026", "yes.  you would be TA.  generally when you bring a food or drink item to a dinner party, etiquette is when you bring something, it's a gift for your host, or a part of the meal.  if the hosts decide people can bring leftovers home with them, that's up to the hosts.  of course they thought it was weird for you to suggest everyone drink the whiskey you gifted to them, it wasn't your decision to make.  and it's even weirder that you want to ask for it back.  if you send the message, you probably won't be invited over ever again.", "YWBTA if you ask for it back. Doesn't matter that you didn't give it with the other gifts. You sound peeved because you only had one glass.", "Your primary complaint seems to be that you only got one drink out of the bottle you brought. Why were your hosts obligated to serve you multiple drinks from that bottle? Your own words, you brought the whiskey to \"cap off the night.\" I guess you only meant YOUR night. \n\nYou can ask for it back, but without a doubt, you'll come across to your hosts as tacky. What's more important: that specific bottle of liquor, or the health of the friendship? You can easily buy more booze, why are you so butthurt about this one? If you overspent, that's on you.\n\nThroughout this entire thread you keep repeating it wasn't a gift it wasn't a gift it wasn't a gift!!! so clearly, you already decided before asking AITA that you aren't. Why bother to ask, then?", "Ywbta. Your opportunity to take it with you, gracefully, possibly, was that night, if at all.  That ship has sailed, now trying to get it would be in bad taste for sure. Let it go.", "YWBTA.  It appeared to everyone that you gifted it and who cares who payed what % for whatever other items.  And everyone knows the rule that if you leave alcohol at someone else's place it becomes their alcohol.", "YTA\n\nI have never, ever heard of someone attending a dinner party at someone else's house or celebration of any kind for that matter,  where someone would bring a bottle, serve drinks from it, then take the bottle home.\n\nThis was bad etiquette up and down.  In a standard dinner party, the hosts are fully responsible for all courses of a meal and entertainment.  It is customary to bring a bottle of wine and present it to the host as a gift, however the host is under no obligation to serve it.  The reasoning is that they gifted wine may not pair well with the meal.  The hosts can keep the gifted wine and serve it at a more appropriate time.  To serve the bottle yourself is co-opting the duties of the host.  (I know this very well as I am a tee-totaller.  I never serve wine with my meals.)\n\nYou were rude to not present it as a gift at the beginning.  You were rude to serve it yourself after the meal.  You were rude to ask for the bottle back.", "YWBTA, take the L here or you will be the \"cheap\" guy the rest of your friendship. Not only will you be talked about behind your back, but you'll make your gf look bad too. Not cool, OP.", "This can\u2019t be real. You can\u2019t possibly be this juvenile.", "YTA it is really strange to go back with your bottle unless you\u2019re a college student", "You would look like the cheapest AH ever.", "YTA \n\nIt was a gift, it would be weird as hell and super rude to ask for it back", "It would be very strange to bring your own bottle of whiskey to a housewarming, make a show of a toast and then take it back with you.  It absolutely looked like a gift and asking for it back now will 100% make you look cheap and be the topic for years attached to your name.  Chalk it up as an expensive misunderstanding and don\u2019t bring bottles you plan to take home in the future.  YTA.", "Recently we were out for the day before planning to go to our friends\u2019 that night. We picked up a little cookie plate and then spied a babka that looked really good, grabbed that too on a whim. We decided to bring both for dinner. About half the babka was eaten and maybe a third of the cookies. At the end of the night our friend re-wrapped the cookies and said \u201cThere\u2019s so much food left over, you brought these, please do take them back!\u201d \n\nSecretly I would rather have had the leftover babka. But she clearly didn\u2019t offer that back. And later she texted me \u201cthe babka was sooo good, thanks again!\u201d Yup she wanted the babka and not the cookies, haha. \n\nDid I still wish for babka? Yes. But she gave us dinner and drinks and other stuff and I brought the babka to be consumed there, so it was totally her choice to keep it. \n\nAll this to say don\u2019t send the message, YWBTA.", "YTA\nIt's a pretty standard thought that if you bring something like this to a housewarming party or even to someone's house for dinner, it's a gift.", "YTA. This was a housewarming dinner. Not a party night with your friends. Of course it seemed like a gift. You would look extremely tacky to ask for it back. Just let it go.", "Lesson learned. Just move on. It would be awkward as they clearly just misinterpreted it as a gift during a confusing situation. They could have drank it by now as well, then what?", "Sorry, but your opportunity to claim the bottle is gone. \n\nYou should have said something when Matt took the bottle from you or before you left. You still would have looked cheap, because the custom is if you bring alcohol to a dinner party, it's a gift to the host. \n\nThe only time You get your alcohol back at a party is if the party was BYOB. Because then you brought your own booze. But in this case you brought booze to a dinner party and that is customarily given to the host for having you over for dinner. \n\nAnd also was pretty arrogant of you to essentially decide what kind of alcohol was going to be served after dinner. They obviously had other plans and you sort of took over. \n\nSo at this point if you ask for the whiskey back, be prepared that they are no longer going to invite you over. \n\nYWBTA", "YTA\n\n\n\nI'm a whiskey drinker. It's a hobby, I have quite the collection, I like to share, I like to give, and I like to drink it. I know $180 buys a really tasty bottle, and not enjoying all of it sucks. BUT -\n\n\n\nYou brought a bottle to a housewarming. Not a bottle share event, not a \"bring something of yours to let others try\" event, a *housewarming*. Unless a particular person said \"Hey, OP, could you bring [specific bottle] so we could TRY it\", anything like a bottle of wine or whiskey falls under 'Gift for the homeowners' category. Even if I think I'm bringing a bottle of whiskey to an event where not everyone will want it, I bring it with the full understanding I won't be going home with it. Have I gone back home with what I brought? Once in a blue moon, that's it, and it was after much protest from me.\n\n\n\nDon't send the message. Save the friendship, don't make things awkward, and enjoy a glass of it the next time you're over their house.", "YTA, what planet are you from dude", "YWBTA. I think your friend group must be drinking expensive scotch and whiskey\u2019s. I can understand your custom then.

Regardless of how you thought it was perceived, literally every other person, including your GF, thought it was a gift.

What\u2019s seems normal to you, isn\u2019t always the norm for others. Sometimes we just have to learn it the hard way. I remember as a teenager taking a big bucket of cookies I had made to an acquaintance\u2019s house to share with some friends. I had no idea it wasn\u2019t appropriate to take them all home when I left until I got weird looks from everyone when I gathered up the bucket to leave.

Take the L and save the face you still have left. Most people who bring any bottles to a dinner do so with the expectation to leave it with the hosts. If you only spent that money on the premise that you'd be drinking too, then it would've been better to invite him to your house. At least you got to try some of it!

You presented it as a nightcap for everyone to enjoy. It was taken by the hosts. \n\nThat being said, it will cause friction to ask for it back. Regardless of whether or not the whisky was a gift, it will be considered one in their minds. Ask for it back, and that's how they'll tell the story.", "I would say NTA. Since the gifts were given at a different time and specified as gifts. The whiskey brought out as a nightcap/gesture, not with the gifts. I think the issue comes from leaving there without the bottle. That just solidified in their minds that it was a gift. If I take a nice bottle to a party/get together that I plan on keeping, I make sure I grab it on my way out. It also depends on the whiskey, Eagle Rare I could see leaving, but a bottle of Stagg is coming home.", "NTA but don\u2019t send the text. I get where you\u2019re coming from.

Emma, her boyfriend and two other couples were present which we are close to also. As a housewarming gift, we brought a nice bouquet and vase for their console and a photo frame so they could frame a nice photo for their living/dining space. I know Emma's boyfriend the least out of the 4 of us partners and I know he likes whiskey so I brought a bottle to make an effort to show that I am interested in getting to know him. I met Emma through Charlotte and she's always saying we should do double dates but I just didn't know Matt that well that I felt comfortable agreeing.\n\nThe event came and it was great. Emma and Matt are great cooks and hosts and their new house is nice. We gave them the flowers and photo frame and they loved them.

The general rule is you present (which is gifting) the bottle to them, and they decide if/when to serve. I think the hosts wanted to serve wine after dinner. There is a pretty big difference between wine and liquor, it was nice of you to present the bottle, but you kind of steamrolled the situation a bit from what it sounds like. It's actually not a breach of etiquette for the hosts to not serve a particular bottle that has been brought by a guest (but something needs to be served) This is a fairly minor faux-pas so I wouldn't sweat that part out.

You don\u2019t bring a bottle, dole it out, then take it home. Just no. Actually I digress. I have a cousin who does this and the entire family makes fun of him for being so cheap and mostly won\u2019t invite him anymore.", "Or he just made the assumption that your social etiquette was in line with 95% of the population?", "My best friend is close enough with me that she can give me back the bottle of champagne I brought her because we didn't drink it. \n\nWhen you don't have that type of relationship with someone, the normal social etiquette is that you don't decline a gift and you don't ask for a gift back.\n\nThe dinner wasn't BYOB. If you didn't prepare to give the drink to them, you should not have brought it. When someone shows up with alcohol to a party, everyone expects you to leave it there. And if you were going to take it, you should have slipped out with it. You don't ask for it back like you left your charger.", "It\u2019s you that doesn\u2019t get the memo\u2026", "Even if that is correct and you and your close mates leave gatherings with half empty bottles of alcohol, e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e on this post is telling you that\u2019s very unusual and NOT the social convention. \n\nEmma and Matt are clearly not in your general friendship circle and would think you\u2019re rude to request a gift back. Don\u2019t take back something presented alongside gifts at a social event. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s probably worth asking your close friends for their take, I have a feeling you\u2019ll find out this habit might be specific to you and they\u2019ve got used to this being your quirk. And it\u2019s something they tolerate rather than think this is normal social convention.", "Drunk too much. What would \"too much\" mean to you? What's \"enough\"? Sometimes one is too many, and a thousand isn't enough.", "It really sounds like you did miss something here.  I'd love to her Emma's thoughts.", "Judging by your responses you are very focused on \u2018I didn\u2019t say or verbalize it was a gift so it isn\u2019t a gift\u2019 aspect. Your inability to comprehend completely that you don\u2019t actually have to say the words for it to be a gift, that social implications have actions meaning more than words says that you don\u2019t completely grasp social cues. You\u2019re also focused on the very black and white literal definition of \u2018couple\u2019 meaning two, so when you bright the liquor out later it\u2019s obvious to you it wasn\u2019t a gift because you already gave them two things. To be clear here there is a lot of nuance that you are missing in the actual event and in everyone online trying to explain it to you. I would consider talking to your partner or friends and see if there\u2019s anything else similar to this that you have difficulty with because this is very neurodivergent behavior.", "And yet your girlfriend was confused by your actions", "You are so hung up on the fact that you never said it was a gift. It\u2019s great!", "The way I would have interpreted that is \"okay the flowers and frame were housewarming gift, the drink is dinner gift\".  Like bringing wine to dinner.\n\nAsking for it back at the end of the night would have been awkward. Asking for it back now is doubly so.", "At the end of the day they would've seen it as a gift because typically if you bring something to a house warm it's seen as a gift, it may not be like that in your friend group but majority of the world see it that way, ywbtah if you ask for it back and if you are really trying to build a friendship there asking for it back is not the way to go. Let this be a learning curve to maybe not take as expensive a bottle of whiskey next time it's best to let things lie as is just so you don't screw up your gfs friendship accidentally", "Exactly! The \u201cpermission\u201d is that I brought a bottle to your house. If you only want to offer someone a glass of the fancy stuff, you do that at your own place.", "His response is insistent that Matt is the outlier here. No, OP and his circle of friends are the outlier. 98% of the population read that post and assumed the whiskey was a gift.", "Emma is but Matt isn't. My close friends also do this, it's not just my own thing", "I'm basically saying there was no good reason to snatch the bottle from me", "Emma's offered me the bottle back, we've resolved it", "It's OP's gift to AITA.", "I can just imagine the beginning of the evening with OP standing there with his bottle behind his back as his gf hands over the items, loudly proclaiming \u2018THESE THINGS ARE YOUR GIFT, WE HAVE BOUGHT YOU FLOWERS AND A PHOTO FRAME\u2019, while whispering \u2018not the bottle of whiskey\u2019 to himself. \n\nAll the comments OP has made about him not outright saying it was a gift\u2026.. does anyone go to a housewarming and say \u2018here is your gift\u2019 while handing it over?? Don\u2019t you just hand whatever it is to the hosts? Maybe with a \u2018got you a little something\u2019?", "Right okay, I figured my stating I had brought 2 outright was enough but I see what you mean", "I don't even really drink and I know this. At least OP learned this social convention now, sadly the lesson was a little pricey.", "No one \u201csnatched the bottle\u201d from you - they assumed you were normal & gifting this as a host present. No one announces \u201cthis is a gift for the hosts\u201d when I bring host presents I just hand it to them or set it down & it\u2019s assumed it\u2019s for them. You are coming across soooooooooooo badly.", "What kind of whiskey was it?", "So you say. Maybe your host thought there was.", "Saying \"a couple\" doesn't always mean exactly two -- sometimes it's the same as \"a few\".\n\nIn retrospect (or for next time) either explicitly saying that you'll be taking back the remainder of the whiskey, or decanting some  the whiskey into a smaller container that you \\*can\\* gift, might be better.\n\nYou could at this point text something like \"I'm really sorry for the confusion, I had brought the whiskey for us to have a nightcap but intended to take the remainder home; I got so flustered that night that I wasn't sure how to clarify the matter\" and ask for it back, but it may look tacky and/or cause offense.  If the friendship is important to you, letting it go might be safer, but if the whiskey is important you \\*can\\* (probably) get it back.", "I don't why he'd think that, he doesn't know me that well. I haven't been too drunk since my early twenties", "YTA. \n\nBeyond college, if you bring a bottle to a party it is for the host to keep.", "Glad your situation resolved, but don\u2019t take that to mean you were correct in thinking you should have asked for it or taken it back. You asked if YTA, and yet you\u2019re arguing with commenters saying you are. Seems like you posted to justify sending your text after your friend told you it was in bad taste. Just because you don\u2019t seem to understand host/guest etiquette doesn\u2019t mean it allows you to make up your own terms. Bringing anything to share to someone else\u2019s house, even if it doesn\u2019t get opened, is then considered property of the host. Chalk it up to lesson learned. If you\u2019re upset about the dollar amount you spent, save the special stuff for when you\u2019re hosting at your own house. YTA", "It's not normal to bring a bottle to.have a drink  and bring it back.  If you bring something it's assumed to be a gift by 99.9% of people. In the future if you want something back don't bring it", "Not only YTA but reading your update, apparently you  managed to make the hosts feel so uncomfortable during your visit they felt the need to swing by your house to give the bottle back. I assure you they will remember you unpleasantly and the guy definitely will not want to be your friend.\n\nOh, and you definitely embarrassed your girlfriend in front of her best friend and her boyfriend.", "Friendship group with different norms I guess", "I'm wondering if the reason the other guy gave it back was he didn't realise quite how expensive it was (I completely agree that taking it out of the OP's hands is rude).", "Turns out I didn't have to luckily. I was leaning on not sending it and just accepting the loss but they actually returned the bottle", "finally a comment i agree with. OP is NTA. if it wasn\u2019t explicitly said, \u201chey this is a gift\u201d then why would they assume it was??\n\nthis might be my autistic brain at work, but if i were to bring something like that, i would fully intend on bringing it back home with me. if my friends come over for a dinner party and bring \ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udca8 with them to smoke with everyone, i don\u2019t expect them to leave it here? tf is that lol", "Yeah, the OP's in the UK and I've seen both here - bring a drink with you that you're clearly taking home again (especially if the bottle is already open when you bring it, then you'd never leave it behind), or bring a drink that everyone drinks a bit of then you leave behind. It's quite context dependent.", "I guess I should have explained in the original post that my friends and I do this between us too, the other couples and Emma and Char included", "It is normal within my friends and I though. To the majority I guess it isn't from these comments", "Nah no embarrassment here on either end, it's all cleared up. Emma and I go way back, we've been friends for years now so no unpleasant memories here either lol", "Right! I didn\u2019t think ppl actually did this until I met my BILs family. They do this! I was shocked the first time I ever saw it. You have to bring your own food to the cookout too!", "I cannot believe I just watched that one again last night as I was falling asleep!!", "So like you want them to catch ur drift? man with the way you\u2019re telling the story you played them and us \ud83d\ude02 glad it\u2019s all cleared up tho. Also he shouldn\u2019t have made u feel awkward by taking the bottle what\u2019s done was done", "Yes the vast majority of the world  it's not normal and is considered very rude ro ask for something you brought back. \nI'm actually really surprised that you don't know this. It's a very common social norm across many cultures/ countries.", "Why would you bring it at all if you\u2019re gonna be a cheapskate and lose sleep over it??", "No, there was a whole \"as new homeowners, we all decided to you get you some things to get started\" and we all gave them the stuff in couples", "We resolved it, I didn't send the text though, they just swung by", "Yeah I see that now. I guess I've just run in the same social circle for so many years that it's just normal for us not to keep anything unless we have explicit permission", "Yeah, it doesn't take long to pop a text into the group chat about it? If it's expensive, i'm not just going to assume it's mine. I think its a polite thing to do", "I wonder how that got started in your group. \nBecause the thought of even asking for a bottle of anything I brought over is mortifying to me.", "Nah it's a friend group thing, my mates do it too. I guess just our friend group thing though, I see its not the norm now though", "Really? We think it's a courtesy thing. I would never like presume something is mine just because they left it, especially if it looks expensive and it doesn't hurt to double check\n\nGod it was so long ago, someone left their bottle behind as a group and someone fired a photo into to the group-chat and the rest is history I guess. I can't really remember the exact scenario", "Did they say why they didn't want you to pour another drink?", "No they didn't. They only stopped by for a brief chat"]}
