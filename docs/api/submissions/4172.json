Of course, Sarah and I had already explained everything to her about all of that, so she wasn't freaked out or anything, but she had just asked Emily to come help her take care of everything since it was her first time.\n\nWell, when my ex wife heard about it she was pissed off.  She was so offended that our daughter had gone to Emily instead of her.  Emily told me (privately) that my daughter said that she went to Emily instead of her mom because she knew that Emily would keep it private and not draw everyone's attention at the party.

Emily felt badly that Sarah was upset, but she was just trying to keep my daughter comfortable.  I told Sarah that I'm sorry that she's upset, but that Emily was the one my daughter chose to go to, and that Sarah should be happy that there are two women around to support my daughter.

I really feel for your daughter. I, like many, had one of those crazy moms who wants to announce to the world when their daughter gets her first period. I would have gone to Emily too.", "NTA here as it is your daughter who made this choice because of who she was comfortable with. \n\nYour title is a bit misleading tho? Is that what you said to your ex? If so, not the best way to discuss this with her.", "NTA your daughter made a choice based on her previous experience and maybe this is a wake up call for the mom that her reactions are too much for private situations for her daughter. Your daughter IS very lucky to have two amazing women in her life that she can turn to\u2764\ufe0f. You are a lucky man to have a fiance that adores your children and they adore her.", "NTA, and neither is Emily. Mom is being jealous, that's all.  Keep that good relationship going with Emily and your daughter-", "NTA but I understand why your ex would be upset. My mother announced it to everyone including a bunch of male friends of my siblings. Your daughter needs to be told she did what was right by her. Please don't let her mom make her feel she was wrong.", "NTA. It's a testament to your coparenting and to your fianc\u00e9e's bond with your kids that she was trusted enough with this information. Your ex is entitled to her feelings, as this is a big mother/daughter moment, but this is something she should have dealt with privately as neither your fianc\u00e9e nor your daughter did anything wrong here. There was no reason to highlight her anger to you about the situation.", "NTA this should be a wakeup call to Sarah.", "NTA, although I think telling your ex she should be happy about something was a bridge way too far. Your daughter just passed a major milestone in her life that her mother had also gone through. Sharing that with your daughter was probably something she'd been looking forward to as a bonding moment.\n\nIt is very understandable that your ex feels a sense of loss of that moment, and minimizing her valid feelings about it is unhelpful.", "NAH\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 did nothing wrong here and kudos to her for helping your daughter with a potentially embarrassing situation.\n\nYour ex is probably feeling hurt that your daughter didnt go to her, and feels like she missed out on a bonding moment. That is understandable and sucks, so i dont think she is TA for being hurt, as long as she isnt taking that hurt out on you, your fianc\u00e9, or your daughter.", "NTA - your daughter made a choice, it was her choice to make\n\nRather than be angry at Sarah, she should do some self reflection on why your daughter went to Sarah and not her", "NTA sounds like there was some jealousy going on there. I think most parents want to be the one to be confided in. When a child chooses a step parent instead that can trigger that those feelings when they can't put the child first. You most certainly are NTA and sounds like you are doing your best to take the high road. Stick to what you've said so far, hopefully your ex can get over herself. Say it again, NTA", "NTA. I'm glad your daughter had someone who made her feel safe in a vulnerable moment.", "NTA. At the end of the day, you can not be responsible for your daughter choosing to go to your fianc\u00e9e rather than her mother in this kind of situation. I understand your ex being upset that her daughter didn\u2019t trust her in this scenario, as having your daughter feel like she can\u2019t trust you must be devastating. However, what your oldest chose to do is her decision and your ex-wife should understand that there are just some things her children will not feel comfortable talking to her about. I know this personally because my 7 (almost 8) year old niece sometimes feels more comfortable talking to me or my other sister rather than her mother about certain things that are bothering her.", "You are not the wrong one here.  Sarah needs a mirror.", "NAH. It sounds like Emily and your daughter have a great relationship. That\u2019s awesome. I will say that I can understand why your ex would be upset though. She feels like her daughter chose Emily over her own mother. That has to be upsetting, even if there\u2019s a legitimate reason for the choice (and it sounds like there was). Hopefully, this just blows over.", "NTA. At all. Neither is fianc\u00e9e. And as someone with a mom who was ver my willing to announce stuff I wanted to keep personal to the world, I totally get your daughter\u2019s reasoning.", "NTA.  Your ex has every reason to be upset\u2026.**at herself** for not having behaved in a way to have her own daughter trust her.  Your fianc\u00e9e did the right thing.", "NTA Only opinion that matters here is your daughter's, and she has made hers clear.", "NTA. Jealousy is real, and I can understand why your ex would be upset but the important thing is your daughter. I expect one of the reasons your daughter went to your fiancee instead of her bio mom is because since it's her house she would know where supplies were kept and your ex-wife wouldn't. I was jealous of my ex getting in touch with our daughter after like 30 years, but eventually it passed and now I'm just thankful that she has more people in her life that love her. It hurts at first, period. I think 99% of the people in the world would be jealous at first, but if you sincerely try to not make it a them/me situation it can turn out well for everyone. Not saying it's easy or it won't take time, but it's possible and worth it.", "NTA the kids mom is just jealous and apparently is known for embarrassing the kids so the kids just trust your fianc\u00e9 more when it comes to some things which is normal. Maybe your ex wife could maybe look into therapy and get help on working through her feelings and co-parenting, because while it\u2019s normal to feel jealous you also have to be careful how you act when jealous because it can come back and hurt the kids. I mean emotionally not that their mom would hurt them, but kids can pick up on a lot so if your ex is all crabby and jealous the kids can pick up on that and start acting out themselves heck a friend of mine his realtionship with his step dad was strained for years because of his father\u2019s jealousy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
