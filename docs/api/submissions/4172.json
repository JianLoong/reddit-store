However, what your oldest chose to do is her decision and your ex-wife should understand that there are just some things her children will not feel comfortable talking to her about.

Jealousy is real, and I can understand why your ex would be upset but the important thing is your daughter. I expect one of the reasons your daughter went to your fiancee instead of her bio mom is because since it's her house she would know where supplies were kept and your ex-wife wouldn't. I was jealous of my ex getting in touch with our daughter after like 30 years, but eventually it passed and now I'm just thankful that she has more people in her life that love her. It hurts at first, period. I think 99% of the people in the world would be jealous at first, but if you sincerely try to not make it a them/me situation it can turn out well for everyone. Not saying it's easy or it won't take time, but it's possible and worth it.", "NTA the kids mom is just jealous and apparently is known for embarrassing the kids so the kids just trust your fianc\u00e9 more when it comes to some things which is normal. Maybe your ex wife could maybe look into therapy and get help on working through her feelings and co-parenting, because while it\u2019s normal to feel jealous you also have to be careful how you act when jealous because it can come back and hurt the kids. I mean emotionally not that their mom would hurt them, but kids can pick up on a lot so if your ex is all crabby and jealous the kids can pick up on that and start acting out themselves heck a friend of mine his realtionship with his step dad was strained for years because of his father\u2019s jealousy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sarah has done nothing wrong, neither has Emily. I got my period on a plane and during the layover in Chicago my mother freaking celebrated with the entire bathroom. I was mortified. It's now a really funny story. I couldn't imagine having a daughter and not sharing this experience with her.

You supported your fiance and you're right, it is amazing for your kids to have 2 mother figures that love them so much.\n\nHowever, a girl getting her period is a \"first\". I imagine your ex thought that it'd be something that she could experience with her only daughter. Just like you'd get upset if you missed the first time your kid walked, or said a word, etc. - she is upset for missing a first, and I get why she'd feel insecure about her relationship with your daughter vs. Emily's.\n\nI think it'd be nice if you try to have your ex look at it from another perspective. Sometimes, in the moment, when we're going through something, it's easier to confide in someone that we consider as being outside of the situation. Your daughter not going to her mom might actually stem from the fact that she was overwhelmed and needed to vent her feelings with someone whom she trusts and loves, but also is more detached - Emily.", "NAH\n\nWhile I understand why the mom is hurt, your daughter\u2019s need to privacy and discretion trumps the feelings of either parent. Sometimes you miss key moments as a parent. It sucks, but it\u2019s life.\n\nI\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 has such a good relationship with your daughter and I hope the mom with hindsight will see that her daughter having multiple trusted adults on her life is a plus.

Cherish that.I hope Sarah can get past her jealousy and figure out how to be as supportive emotionally so the kids can trust her as much. I'm sure it doesn't feel good. But the fact that you've all been able to work things out so far is a good indication that she'll be able to make peace with it.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by being supportive of your daughter's healthy choices.Now, you can also encourage Sarah to build further trust with her by respecting her boundaries. She's done a pretty darn good job so far - make sure she knows that, too. She just has this one area that could use some work.", "No one is TA.

She made her feelings your problem, that's the problem. She has an opportunity to learn the hard way that being a noisy fussbucket about things her daughter wants to keep private will damage her experience with her daughter.

I was at my grandmother's when I got my first period and she felt the need to tell everyone. Every. Single. Person. in my family that she could think of, lol. I was mortified.

She went to Emily because she knew she was safe to go to Emily, and not Sarah. If Sarah wants the kids to come to her about personal things, then she needs to learn to keep that information to herself and not blurt it out to everyone. She is mad at you and Emily for her own flaws that she needs to work on, a flaw that would be fairly easy to fix, but would rather get mad and blame others, than take responsibility and fix the issue.", "NTA. Your ex is pissed because her own past behavior has caused her daughter not to trust her.", "NTA its amazing that your daughter feels comfortable enough to share that moment with your significant other and shows they truly have a bond which some people dont expierence with thier mum/dads new partners. I understand that your ex missed out on a crucial mother daughter moment however as long as your daughter is comfortable then any other feelings should be put aside for her happiness especially as your daughter now being a young lady and having to deal with ever changing hormones and changes to her body.", "NTA your ex is letting her ego and own hurt feelings come before the best interests of her own child.

Emily did nothing wrong but I can see your ex getting territorial over milestones.", "Oh the trials and tribulations of co-parenting. NTA.", "NAH. \n\nKids are just honest!

That was your mistake, don't care how well you get along there is a reason why you are ex's .", "Definitely NTA. I didn\u2019t tell my mom for 4 days when I first got my period.

I wish I\u2019d had someone I trusted to talk to about it like your daughter has your fianc\u00e9. \n\nYour EX is most likely upset bc her daughter not coming to her forces some introspective thought onto the reasoning and how she is as a mother/feeling replaced. The easier option is to put blame on you and fianc\u00e9. \n\nMom should be happy daughter has positive adult role models that she trusts and, if she\u2019s able to get over the gut reaction of anger, do some self-reflection and see how she can better be there for her daughter. Even then, it\u2019s an awkward, embarrassing-for-no-reason time of life and sometimes it\u2019s easier to go to someone you trust but who isn\u2019t your parent, she should also try and accept she won\u2019t always be the first person her daughter goes to.", "I kinda disagree, since it DOES say daughter went to his fiance because she knew it would be kept a secret/  wouldn't be any unwanted attention drawn to her.

I'm sorry. \n\nMy kids and I are pretty open about it.

Then my ex wife approached me angry.", "Kids learn from watching trusted adults have hard conversations and regulate their emotions.

Then maybe it can be resolved so future situations don't hurt anyone.\n\nIf Sarah uses that conversation to berate the daughter or punish her, then sure, she would be the AH.

You perfectly know that parenting is not am exact science everybody does mistakes. Who carried that child and pushes her out for hours? First period is huge turning point. It is all cute now because your giggly blending family mood like all the darn divorced parents who are sooo in their bubbles they can see pass their noses...but once shes a teenager and starts hiding things because she feels like she can't talk to yer parent and goes behind everyone's back alone and traumatised for an abortion it won't be as fun. You shouldve told your daughter that in the futur she can and should feel free to talk to her mom. You should tell your girlfriend that she did well but in the futur to consult the parents and keep bounderies. The thing is that child has two parents no matter how good the s*x is no matter how well they get along no matter anything no matter if you marry her or have 10 more kids with her shes not the mother. And the lack of empathy u had is disgusting. What if the tables were turned and your daughter now 15 decided to introduced her boyfriend to your ex's boyfriend but not to you because she got anxiety that maybe you would not react the way she wished you would.... would you really be super thrill and say heyy lucky that paul was there to handle my daughter for me thats only fair and wonderful. Your ex reacted like that because she felt like a crappy mother unfit that no one can trust. She was hurt and sad. As a mom bunch of women already feel like they are loosing their kids just because the kid grow up...let alone be totally replace as a mom by kate the dad's girlfriend. This right there is a good reason for everyone without kids not to have any. And not being attentive to your ex's feeling while being hypocrite cause like I said if the tables were turned you wouldnt like it...will impact negatively the family and one day your ex won't lisent or care about ur feelings like you don't about hers. Not to mention tensions and impact on ur kids. Blended family are never as sparkly and butterflies as the adult in love are making themselves believe it is...my advice fix this..let ur ex know that u get her feelings understand why she was hurt and be sorry. Give your girlfriend thr memo that she can encourage ur daughter to talk to her parents...not just be like yeah secrets between us girls!! We are besties this is so cute. Nope if she tells your daughter everytime to talk to you and ur mom...your ex will feel more at ease knowing that kate is not trying to replace her as a mom. And you stop pretending like your ex is an homeless man on thanksgiving trying to break in the house to steal some turkey. Shes the mother of ur kids the reasons why the kid is there in the first place...both of you are. So work harder to keep the peace and do better. Don't ever say that again it is mean dismissive gaslighting and devalidating and anybody saying otherwise clearly wants to look at this situation only one way ...are men or have no children or don't know how blended families are pure hell. We don't even need fire or demon just blended families does the job", "NTA - Sarah is butt hurt and needs to get over it.\n\nBesides - your daughter was in your home. Not her mother's house.

When she actually started, she didn't even bother to tell me for like four months, when she needed more supplies lol....I really didn't feel like I missed out on a bonding experience with her.", "NTA and thank god for Emily. Your daughter didn't do anything wrong and she should be told this. She went to the person she felt most comfortable with.

My mom was taking one of her 2 hour baths (she was a bathtub reader) so I knocked on the door, cracked it enough that she could hear me and told her I got my period.

OP, maybe your wife didn\u2019t express anger towards your daughter; if that\u2019s the case, great. But if she did, it would be a good idea to really reassure your daughter that none of this was her fault. You may want to do it anyway, just to be safe. Kids are really prone to take on blame that isn\u2019t theirs and internalize it. Especially if they have to manage the emotions of a parent. Again, if that\u2019s not the case, then yay!

And coming to OP mad about it isn\u2019t a great sign, either. Of course, any mom would have the right to have feelings about a situation like this.

It's a shared venting scenario of something we both have to put up with.  The other day, she came and told me her period had started, only because I had mentioned to her that I'd lost track of the weeks, and we both know mine usually starts a few days after hers.

First step, first word, first lost tooth, and many others. I dont personally feel this event needed to be celebrated, but its also not like my opinion means other people have to agree.\n\nBecause you brought up other bodily functions, changing diapers isnt a magical moment.

I don't think they're a symbol of fertility that needs to be celebrated, but they're a necessary part of being able to procreate. \n\nSurrounding something half of the population will have to deal with for half of their lives in negativity like you have seems like a really unhealthy way to handle a natural part of life.", "You don\u2019t suddenly become an adult. It happens gradually. First menarche is one of the first steps along that path. Certainly a first step into having an adult body.", "They didn't say she was an adult.  They said this event was part of the TRANSITION.  Which it literally is.  Menstruation is part of puberty, which is the biological transition from childhood to adulthood.", "You are a god damn Saint", "I know, i'll just never understand it", "NTA - your daughter obviously feels comfortable with Emily so I don't see what the problem is. Sarah, instead of getting angry, should probably evaluate why she isn't trusted by her own daughter.", "When I got my first period we were at a party at my aunt's house. I went to my aunt to ask for a pad, since my mom is the opposite of discrete. My aunt took me to the bathroom and helped me get situated. When we got back to the group, my mom asked me if something was wrong, and I told her no. She went to my aunt who quietly told her what happened and my mom practically SHOUTED \"She got her period?!?\" E.v e.r.y.o.n.e. looked at me, and the topic of conversation for the next half hour was periods and puberty related. When I got upset with her about it later, she got angry at me for being mad at her. I'm 41 now, and I still remember that.  My mom's mouth is the reason I don't tell her even half the things that go on in my life.\n\nMy point is, if your daughter didn't go to her mom, it's likely for a good reason. If that upsets your ex, then she needs to do some self-reflection and work on improving her relationship with her daughter. And that has nothing to do with you or your fianc\u00e9. NTA.", "NTA. Your ex should be grateful that your daughter was comfortable going to Emily for help. The situation was handled discreetly. Understandable that your daughter would tell your ex. It\u2019s not the hill to die on, as to who gets to claim victory over announcing your daughter\u2019s  transition from childhood.", "I kind of feel like OP is secretly happy his daughter went to his fianc\u00e9.", "NTA- your daughter trusted Emily more to keep this information privileged more than her birth mom. \n\nI can see why Sarah was hurt. Instead of getting angry, she should think about what led to her daughter feeling this way and take steps to correct her behavior.", "NTA. As someone who had their first period on thanksgiving and also had it announced to the whole family, your daughter made the right choice", "NTA. Your daughter knew best!", "Honestly. My mom would talk about *everything.* I'm glad I only grew up when Facebook was big, not insta and TikTok. Yes you made that child. They still need privacy to feel safe.", "Someone however should explain why the daughter went to Emily instead of mom, she wouldn\u2019t be quiet and would embarrass the daughter and at 12 everything is embarrassing, sometime\u2019s it\u2019s ok to let it happen but this is not one of those times.", "My mom didn't tell anybody. In fact, she had nothing to do it. She was at work so my two older sisters helped me. Honestly I probably would have gone to my sisters even if my mom had been at home. They taught me everything; how to dress, how to do makeup and hair, how to deal with boys, how to navigate high school. Older sisters can be a pain, but boy when they come through they're the greatest.", "And I hate you with a passion that time will not diminish.  :-)", "I'm not inviting any of you to my Christmas party, that I am not having!", "NTA and this post makes me kinda sad, really\u2026 sounds like you could have a parenting dream team if only mom would let her stupid ego go.", "Sounds like the only person your ex should be angry at is herself for reacting to things so badly in the past that your daughter no longer trusts how she will react. And the temper tantrum she is having about this proves it. NTA", "Sounds like it's too late for your ex-wife. You have already replaced her in your daughter's eyes. If I was Sarah, I would cut all contact with Emily. I feel sorry for Sarah. Emily took away one of the most important mother-daughter bonding moments. Emily should have sent your daughter to her mother.", "NTA- my sister made a huge Facebook post about her little girl becoming a woman. I\u2019m really happy your daughter had a safe person she could go to.", "NTA. My mother would do this type of thing growing up. It would seriously piss me off. I love her, but I could never trust her with that type of information, because I am a considerably more private person in those regards. I would say if anything your ex needs to look at that example and see if there are other examples where she may have not respected the wishes for privacy of your daughter. \n\n\u2018Bonding\u2019 won\u2019t happen when there is no foundation of trust or respect of want of privacy. It always creeps me out when people refer to those types of situations as \u2018bonding\u2019 moments. It\u2019s not enjoyable. It is simply a part of life. The only difference is that now she can potentially have children of her own (something that is completely up to her & hopefully very far in the future).\n\nI would rather bond on a trip or adventure than that.", "NTA\n\nLol is she not embarrassed to complain to you? The lack of self-awareness.", "Getting your period can be so upsetting too. I remember at that age being made fun of for using pads. I couldnt use tampons because my mom wasnt the type to explain things. My mom made a big deal of things like that too, so I was mortified to tell her when mine was happening. I still remember her trying to do the birds and bees talk my sophomore year of college. Urgh, like, no, mom, unnecessary at this point thanks.\n\nThen again, my mom is the type who replies to news about a miscarriage like you're telling her the weather.", "Stop making huge nonsensical baseless claims. There is no fucking proof for anything you just said.", "I was so annoyed my mom told my dad I complained about it years later, to which my mom said, \u201cYour dad or my dad? Because I told Grandpa, too.\u201d", "In my country we have this tradition where when something good happens, you bring chocolate candies to your family's and friends' house to celebrate. My mom brought a full box of chocolate candies to her family to celebrate that I jsut had my period when I was 11. I think she doesn't know how embarrassing that was.", "kids want to trust their parents. its practically instinctual. so the fact that the kid was like \"nope, this is a job for Emily\" speaks volumes", "You\u2019re not the AH here but perhaps rather than saying \u201cget over it\u201d you could respond with a bit more compassion. You said that you both usually coparent pretty well so I imagine Sarah was probably having a bit of a \u201cboohoo for me, my child chose someone else to confide in\u201d moment and there\u2019s a lot of jealousy and maybe even a small does of unexpected reality for her. She\u2019s angry and doesn\u2019t want to take it out on her daughter so you were the only available target. Just calmly repeat the story here and tell Sarah you understand her frustrations but that she must know that having Emily in your daughters life is a bonus for everyone. Sarah will have to see the logic in this eventually even if she doesn\u2019t want to right now. Being kind goes a long way.", "NAH", "Nta\u2026. This says more about your daughters relationship with her mother than anything else your ex needs to take a step back and figure out why her daughter doesn\u2019t trust her that would be my question \n\nYour wife did nothing wrong neither did your daughter", "I think it is best if you stop including your ex in your parties jealousy will definitely build up if there is an ex. NTA", "I hate that this mom (and many others) do frame your first period as a \"bonding moment\" or that something has been taken from them not \"sharing it.\" The reality it's an intro to something that is mundane, uncomfortable, inconvenient, and like most things we do in the bathroom, pretty private. It's a little creepy to me the fanfare that people assign to young girls starting to ovulate.", "You must be awesome at yoga with that stretch.", "You are getting downvoted because your assumptions make you the AH. Stop trying to find a way to make it his fault. The fact that you even asked in this context shows your bias. Also looking through you past comments shows your bias.", "I\u2019m offended that you\u2019re not inviting me to a party you\u2019re not having and I wasn't going to go to. Taking back the Christmas gift I wasn\u2019t getting you.", "The only A here is your ex wife who is jealous. NTA", "NAH-\nI didn\u2019t get a first period, I got pains so bad we thought my appendix had burst. An imperforated hymen meant my body had retained my first 6-7 periods and I needed surgery to correct it.\nSo yeah, my whole family knew I was a huge freak. I was 17.", "I started my first period at 10 at my dad\u2019s parents house. My mom announced it to the whole family. Emily is doing a great job!", "NTA AT ALL! Emily handled the situation with grace, just as your daughter knew she would. I love that this trust and bond has grown between them! Your ex is clearly not as over things as she lets on because it sounds like she has some jealousy issues re: Emily. Sarah needs to accept that there is another mom in her kids' lives and that's that. Found family is real family and blood isn't the only tie that binds!", "NTA she went to who made her comfortable. Ex got upset, which I get to a degree. It's an important mile stone, but it shouldn't have been made about her at all", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s up to your daughter who she decides to go to.\n\nSome people can really be dramatic with this stuff.", "You are 100% NTA. \n\nI can understand your ex feeling \"left out\" (and probably a bit jealous too) about your daughter going to Emily rather than her - but she shouldn't blow up like that. \n\nI personally think it's really great that your kids are comfortable with your fianc\u00e9e, especially about things like this. It can also be very hard for your ex to maybe feel slightly replaced by them seeing her as a bonus mum - but that is your ex's problem, not yours, not your kids', not anyone else's.", "It sounds like the mum is an AH. \n\nMy mum was fuming when I went to a family friend when I got my first period because 'she'd always thought I would go to her' despite spending my childhood giving me every reason not to. I told her the reason too, I didn't trust her. She slapped me. \n\nSo, OP, while Sarah may not be quite as vile as my mum, your daughter made her choice and even gave a reason for her choice. Feel happy that she has a woman in her life that she does trust and she can go to. \n\nTell your ex to get over herself and maybe look at why her daughter didn't trust her not to make the moment all about her. As she's doing now. Probably still causing your daughter embarrassment and discomfort and re-enforcing her original choice further. \n\nTrying not to project here, but from your daughter's perspective, I hate your ex.", "I didn\u2019t live with my mom growing up, and one rare weekend when I was over to visit was very shortly after I got my first period so my dad packed me supplies just in case I started back up while there. \n\nMy mom found them in my bag and loudly (she was drunk) announced to the entire apartment complex that \u201cMy daughter is a bitch now\u201d all proud. I was mortified and asked to go home (to my dad) and she got all mad. \n\nI\u2019m so glad OP\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t have to experience her mother being weird about her period in front of people.", "Exactly. \nThe mother should be prepared to hear less and less about her daughter's life as she clearly can't behave in a reasonable manner.", "NTA. Sarah. Needs to do some reflection on her own behaviour - on the Reason her daughter was uncomfortable going to HER in the situation. That says loads about HER parenting style & it's effect on her Daughter. She should not be angry with anyone but herself here.", "NAH I can see why your ex is upset.  I think that is a normal reaction.", "NTA. Your daughter is going to seek out the adult she feels most comfortable with in that situation. My stepdaughter came to me about hers when it started as well. When I started mine, my mom announced it to many people and I was horrified and honestly a little traumatized because I knew nothing about periods. Your child being comfortable is what is important", "See, the concept of changing diapers being a bonding moment is thoroughly alien to me. This kinda thing isn't something i'll ever be able to understand", "Birth is natural too, and i hate the concept of that so much I had my tubes tied. Just accept that out experiences and viewpoints are different and move on", "NTA. Emily sounds lovely.\nI never understood why some moms want to make a big deal out of their kid's first period. My mom dealt with it quietly, just like Emily. It's really not a big bonding moment.", "NTA\n\nIt should be moment for introspection for your ex.  She should ask herself why her daughter was more comfortable with someone else with such a private moment."]}
