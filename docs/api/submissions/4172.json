However, what your oldest chose to do is her decision and your ex-wife should understand that there are just some things her children will not feel comfortable talking to her about.

Jealousy is real, and I can understand why your ex would be upset but the important thing is your daughter. I expect one of the reasons your daughter went to your fiancee instead of her bio mom is because since it's her house she would know where supplies were kept and your ex-wife wouldn't. I was jealous of my ex getting in touch with our daughter after like 30 years, but eventually it passed and now I'm just thankful that she has more people in her life that love her. It hurts at first, period. I think 99% of the people in the world would be jealous at first, but if you sincerely try to not make it a them/me situation it can turn out well for everyone. Not saying it's easy or it won't take time, but it's possible and worth it.", "NTA the kids mom is just jealous and apparently is known for embarrassing the kids so the kids just trust your fianc\u00e9 more when it comes to some things which is normal. Maybe your ex wife could maybe look into therapy and get help on working through her feelings and co-parenting, because while it\u2019s normal to feel jealous you also have to be careful how you act when jealous because it can come back and hurt the kids. I mean emotionally not that their mom would hurt them, but kids can pick up on a lot so if your ex is all crabby and jealous the kids can pick up on that and start acting out themselves heck a friend of mine his realtionship with his step dad was strained for years because of his father\u2019s jealousy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sarah has done nothing wrong, neither has Emily. I got my period on a plane and during the layover in Chicago my mother freaking celebrated with the entire bathroom. I was mortified. It's now a really funny story. I couldn't imagine having a daughter and not sharing this experience with her. Sarah is allowed to be upset and it does not make her a bad mother.", "NAH \n\nEmily acted perfectly in accommodating your daughter and making her feel comfortable. You supported your fiance and you're right, it is amazing for your kids to have 2 mother figures that love them so much.\n\nHowever, a girl getting her period is a \"first\". I imagine your ex thought that it'd be something that she could experience with her only daughter. Just like you'd get upset if you missed the first time your kid walked, or said a word, etc. - she is upset for missing a first, and I get why she'd feel insecure about her relationship with your daughter vs. Emily's.\n\nI think it'd be nice if you try to have your ex look at it from another perspective. Sometimes, in the moment, when we're going through something, it's easier to confide in someone that we consider as being outside of the situation. Your daughter not going to her mom might actually stem from the fact that she was overwhelmed and needed to vent her feelings with someone whom she trusts and loves, but also is more detached - Emily.", "NAH\n\nWhile I understand why the mom is hurt, your daughter\u2019s need to privacy and discretion trumps the feelings of either parent. Sometimes you miss key moments as a parent. It sucks, but it\u2019s life.\n\nI\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 has such a good relationship with your daughter and I hope the mom with hindsight will see that her daughter having multiple trusted adults on her life is a plus. Maybe she\u2019ll also learn to not embarrass her children.", "NAH\n\nYour fiance could have quietly gone up to your ex and let her know.\n\nAs a mother I can see how it would be hurtful to be in the same room but kept out of the loop.

No. In fact she laughed and thought it was really sweet of her boss to help since my mom didn\u2019t have any products with her", "NTA your ex needs to stop making this about her. It is about your daughter.

Of course the girlfriend (now wife) took care of it at the time with getting them products they needed.\n\nI somewhat understand your ex's feelings being hurt over your daughter going to someone other than her but like you said.. she should be happy that your daughter trusts someone who is around her half of the time.

It\u2019s the start of suffering as a female, not something to celebrate unless you only value your child as a baby machine.
