Jealousy is real, and I can understand why your ex would be upset but the important thing is your daughter. I expect one of the reasons your daughter went to your fiancee instead of her bio mom is because since it's her house she would know where supplies were kept and your ex-wife wouldn't. I was jealous of my ex getting in touch with our daughter after like 30 years, but eventually it passed and now I'm just thankful that she has more people in her life that love her. It hurts at first, period. I think 99% of the people in the world would be jealous at first, but if you sincerely try to not make it a them/me situation it can turn out well for everyone. Not saying it's easy or it won't take time, but it's possible and worth it.", "NTA the kids mom is just jealous and apparently is known for embarrassing the kids so the kids just trust your fianc\u00e9 more when it comes to some things which is normal. Maybe your ex wife could maybe look into therapy and get help on working through her feelings and co-parenting, because while it\u2019s normal to feel jealous you also have to be careful how you act when jealous because it can come back and hurt the kids. I mean emotionally not that their mom would hurt them, but kids can pick up on a lot so if your ex is all crabby and jealous the kids can pick up on that and start acting out themselves heck a friend of mine his realtionship with his step dad was strained for years because of his father\u2019s jealousy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sarah has done nothing wrong, neither has Emily. I got my period on a plane and during the layover in Chicago my mother freaking celebrated with the entire bathroom. I was mortified. It's now a really funny story. I couldn't imagine having a daughter and not sharing this experience with her.

You supported your fiance and you're right, it is amazing for your kids to have 2 mother figures that love them so much.\n\nHowever, a girl getting her period is a \"first\". I imagine your ex thought that it'd be something that she could experience with her only daughter. Just like you'd get upset if you missed the first time your kid walked, or said a word, etc. - she is upset for missing a first, and I get why she'd feel insecure about her relationship with your daughter vs. Emily's.\n\nI think it'd be nice if you try to have your ex look at it from another perspective. Sometimes, in the moment, when we're going through something, it's easier to confide in someone that we consider as being outside of the situation. Your daughter not going to her mom might actually stem from the fact that she was overwhelmed and needed to vent her feelings with someone whom she trusts and loves, but also is more detached - Emily.", "NAH\n\nWhile I understand why the mom is hurt, your daughter\u2019s need to privacy and discretion trumps the feelings of either parent. Sometimes you miss key moments as a parent. It sucks, but it\u2019s life.\n\nI\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 has such a good relationship with your daughter and I hope the mom with hindsight will see that her daughter having multiple trusted adults on her life is a plus.

The only person here who's the AH is the ex-wife for getting upset over this and for whatever actions she did in the past that made your daughter think it wouldn't go well if she told her mom.", "NTA you seem to have a good co-parent relationship going. Your daughter has chosen to explain why she went to your fiancee for help. In this instance this is a learning point for Sarah. Be discreet.", "op=nta  Neither is Emily.  \n\nNot sure if Sarah qualifies because she's \"hurt\" but for daughter's sake, she needs to suck it up.", "NAH .This is super wholesome and I want to congratulate Emily for being an awesome adult that children feel comfortable confiding in. Cherish that.I hope Sarah can get past her jealousy and figure out how to be as supportive emotionally so the kids can trust her as much. I'm sure it doesn't feel good. But the fact that you've all been able to work things out so far is a good indication that she'll be able to make peace with it.\n\nYou're doing the right thing by being supportive of your daughter's healthy choices.Now, you can also encourage Sarah to build further trust with her by respecting her boundaries. She's done a pretty darn good job so far - make sure she knows that, too. She just has this one area that could use some work.", "No one is TA. Your daughter went to your fiance of her own will and your ex is hurt, and understandably so. It's just complicated family dynamics.", "NTA - So your ex already knew there was a perfectly good reason for this and instead of accepting that, or even trying to address it with your daughter, she decided to come yell at you over it. I mean, I get it, this is a tough pill to swallow for her, but that doesn\u2019t excuse lashing out like this.", "NTA she's upset, which I understand. She made her feelings your problem, that's the problem. She has an opportunity to learn the hard way that being a noisy fussbucket about things her daughter wants to keep private will damage her experience with her daughter. She is blowing that learning opportunity to cause problems for you and Emily. The next time this comes up it may be an even harder lesson. Some people never learn.", "NTA. I was at my grandmother's when I got my first period and she felt the need to tell everyone. Every. Single. Person. in my family that she could think of, lol. I was mortified. Your daughter chose who she was most comfortable with in the moment and I am sorry for her mom that it was not her but it is not your fault and it is not Emily's fault.", "NTA\nSarah seems to have a history of divulging private information in inappropriate ways and your daughter knows this, and wanted to avoid it. She went to Emily because she knew she was safe to go to Emily, and not Sarah. If Sarah wants the kids to come to her about personal things, then she needs to learn to keep that information to herself and not blurt it out to everyone. She is mad at you and Emily for her own flaws that she needs to work on, a flaw that would be fairly easy to fix, but would rather get mad and blame others, than take responsibility and fix the issue.", "NTA. Your ex is pissed because her own past behavior has caused her daughter not to trust her.", "NTA its amazing that your daughter feels comfortable enough to share that moment with your significant other and shows they truly have a bond which some people dont expierence with thier mum/dads new partners. I understand that your ex missed out on a crucial mother daughter moment however as long as your daughter is comfortable then any other feelings should be put aside for her happiness especially as your daughter now being a young lady and having to deal with ever changing hormones and changes to her body.", "NTA your ex is letting her ego and own hurt feelings come before the best interests of her own child. She should be ecstatic that there is another woman in her daughter\u2019s life that will treat her as her own.", "Sometimes having an older female that is more of an auntie than a mom can be easier to confide in. Someone who has experience, but is a little less emotionally invested can feel easier to deal with in an intense moment. NAH", "NTA, I don't think there's a right response for you to give. Emily did nothing wrong but I can see your ex getting territorial over milestones.", "Oh the trials and tribulations of co-parenting. NTA.", "NAH. \n\nKids are just honest! But I think it's unavoidable and completely understandable that Sarah would be really really hurt by this. I don't think Sarah is TA for being upset, and you seem to have been about as diplomatic as you could have been, so you are not TA either.", "You invited your ex-wife to a party? That was your mistake, don't care how well you get along there is a reason why you are ex's .", "Definitely NTA. I didn\u2019t tell my mom for 4 days when I first got my period. She\u2019d given me some pads ahead of time and I used those in secret bc I didn\u2019t want to have to go to her. I wish I\u2019d had someone I trusted to talk to about it like your daughter has your fianc\u00e9. \n\nYour EX is most likely upset bc her daughter not coming to her forces some introspective thought onto the reasoning and how she is as a mother/feeling replaced. The easier option is to put blame on you and fianc\u00e9. \n\nMom should be happy daughter has positive adult role models that she trusts and, if she\u2019s able to get over the gut reaction of anger, do some self-reflection and see how she can better be there for her daughter. Even then, it\u2019s an awkward, embarrassing-for-no-reason time of life and sometimes it\u2019s easier to go to someone you trust but who isn\u2019t your parent, she should also try and accept she won\u2019t always be the first person her daughter goes to.", "I kinda disagree, since it DOES say daughter went to his fiance because she knew it would be kept a secret/  wouldn't be any unwanted attention drawn to her. So I wouldn't say mom ISNT an AH.", "You mixed up the names there. Sarah is the mom, the daughter went to Emily", "no. The problem is mother's big mouth", "that surely was not on the fianc\u00e9e to out the periods of the daughter to her mother. She needs privacy (Are you Sarah ?)", "The daughter chose to tell Emily. Emily really shouldn\u2019t tell anyone else, especially not at a big event. Maybe afterward, since it\u2019s medically relevant, but really the daughter should be the only one to say who should know.", "Exactly!", "That was my first thought, too. That it was Emily's house so she asked Emily.", "NTA, it\u2019s just unfortunate for your ex wife sadly :( you all did what we appropriate and longterm what matters is that your daughter felt comfortable during this unexpected event", "I wish my mom had just told the whole family. Instead she made *me* tell them.", "I stopped telling my mum things after I got sick of telling her something was a secret only to overhear her telling someone one the phone.\nAnd when I complained it was \"only Sarah/Jane/Amanda*\" and I didn't need to be upset.\n\nOP's ex only has themselves to blame and doesn't like it so she's trying to blame Emily instead.", "Yeah, I\u2019m usually good at keeping track of the names \n\nThanks for the heads up", "Ugh. I keep TRYING to remind myself not to tell my mom everything because she STILL shares my stuff inappropriately or fusses over me to the point of stalkerish behavior and I hate it.\n\nBut then I forget, and I share something with her, and regret it within 48 hours.", "Yikes... I'm sorry. \n\nMy kids and I are pretty open about it. We basically handle it the same was as having to use the bathroom for any other reason. \n\nJust like there is no reason to announce or be embarrassed by a bowel movement or urination, no reason to announce or be embarrassed by a period.", "I didn't tell her.  I never said I told her.  My daughter ended up telling her after the fact.  Then my ex wife approached me angry.", "Kids learn from watching trusted adults have hard conversations and regulate their emotions. Kids will think they're out of control whenever they feel negative emotions if they only ever see adults have outbursts of negative emotions and never moments of regulation. They need to see their trusted adults handling negative emotions without being aggressive or repressing their true feelings.", "Having a calm conversation with another adult about your feelings isn't a problem.", "People allowed to be unhappy about something if they're not acting negatively on those feelings.  If the daughter is old enough to have her period, she's old enough for Sarah to have a respectful discussion about how it affected her and why daughter didn't feel comfortable talking to her about it.  Then maybe it can be resolved so future situations don't hurt anyone.\n\nIf Sarah uses that conversation to berate the daughter or punish her, then sure, she would be the AH.  But for fuck's sake, feeling emotions by themselves are not a crime, and hiding them behind an icy facade rather than ever talking is going to make things worse, not better.", "Yup. \n  literal child abuse gets justified with  \"oh it's just between family so it's not creepy\".  Actually no that makes it even worse!!!", "Lol @ I was not \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Lol. Did you correct the department store? \n\nWow i would have screamed at my dad, but I can't imagine him telling anyone anything that personal", "Everyone's shit here.", "It wouldn't have gone well if I had tried. He throws massive adult tantrums when he's upset or doesn't get his way. A friend of mine was working there and she was trying really hard to laugh because it was 1) ridiculous and 2) an asshole move because she had just told me us she had been diagnosed with cervical cancer secondary to HPV.", "\u2764 I hate you too. \u2764", "OMG. That is horrible."]}
