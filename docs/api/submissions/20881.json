No one likes having to deal with their Housemate's guests. And having her there for 3/4 nights once per month is pretty small.  \nThat's once a week.", "YTA - does this really affect you that much?  One weekend a month like he's proposing is quite reasonable.  Think of it this way, if it was one night a week it would be about about the same, just not all at once.", "Thanks for everyones feedback on this, I haven\u2019t had a roommate for 8 years, and I guess I am still adjusting to sharing the space.

YTA", "YTA \n\nhe pays rent and can entertain occasionnal guests in his home/room.\n\n3 nights a month is not unreasonnable. She is not becoming your new forced roommate.\n\ni find it extremely weird that you\u2019d be more agreeing to have random strangers from tinder Staying overnight than a trusted, known and stable relationship?\n\n tbh you sound a bit frustrated he found someone so soon and you did not .", "Is he paying rent? Then you don\u2019t have a say in this situation.", "YTA \n\nHe LIVES there. It\u2019s his home too. Right? \n\nHe has every right to have visitors if he pays rent. \n\nYou also can\u2019t say \u201chey I\u2019m ok if you bring a random shag home every weekend, but not one person 3 nights a month\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not even logical. \n\nI think you need to get Sheldon\u2019s roommate agreement out!", "YTA, it's his partner and this is part of having roommates. It's much better than bumping into random one night stands every Saturday morning. Also, 3 nights/month isn't that much. You'll probably hardly even see her, it won't impact your life at all really.", "YTA, my roommate does smth similar, she needs me to text her everytime my boyfriend comes over, i pay the exact same amount in rent and we have our own rooms, but she\u2019s just so controlling ab it.", "Yta, you can\u2019t tell him what he does in his own room, and he can certainly have his girlfriend over.  If he pays rent, it\u2019s not up to you tbh.", "YTA.\n\n3 nights a month with the same person whom he already knows? Would you prefer her has 7 one night stands a month instead??", "YTA - 3 nights out of a whole month is nothing. He pays rent and that is more than reasonable. If I were him and you told me my gf couldn't stay a few nights out of the month I'd laugh.", "YTA you\u2019re creating conflict where there really isn\u2019t one. He\u2019s renting a room, he can have a guest for 3 nights. It\u2019s not enough to say she\u2019s living there or moved in. You should really consider yourself lucky it\u2019s not a situation where she\u2019s  there all day, every day.", "Thus us better than a girlfriend who lives close.  You'd see her a lot more often.  A few days once a month is better than random days whenever with no notice.\n\nYTA this is not a big deal from a roommate.", "YTA --- Does your housemate get to dictate when and how long you can have people stay??.", "yta - 3-4 nights in a row once per month is ridiculously low key and not a big deal. this is sketchy as hell controlling behavior", "YTA, 3 days a month is F all... If he's not living there for free then he can have her over as much as he wants really... As long as she isn't living there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your friend wants to spend one weekend a month with his girlfriend, then he should be allowed to do so. It does seem like you\u2019ve acknowledged what you\u2019ve done was wrong, so hopefully all goes well with you, your roommate and his girlfriend!", "YTA\n\ngrow up dude, like I guess its not that big of a deal and your not that unjustified in your feelings, after all you have a right to be pissed off in whatever you want, kinda like how people have a right to not like ice cream. But that doesn't mean you have a say in anything. Its your job to get over it, not his job to change.", "Unless there's some genuine reason that her being there will cause a problem, YTA. Would you be ok if he put limits on how often your partner could visit? If he's paying half the rent, it's half his house. Any rules that apply to him should apply to you also.", "It\u2019s looking like YWBTA here if you said anything. Assuming he\u2019s paying equal rent, he should be allowed to have any sort of guest around and 3-4 nights a month is less than 10% of the time. Back when I had roommates, I would\u2019ve loved if they\u2019d only done the things that bothered me 10% of the time.", "In every lease with roommates we agree how often we can have people sleep over beforehand. 3 nights per week is common, 3 nights per month is nothing. You can\u2019t expect single people to not have overnight guests. YTA", "Remember he lives there. You\u2019re not his Mum. Rules go both ways. Also rules should be agreed on BEFORE things occur and not in the heat of the moment \u201cas the owner\u201d", "YTA it's one weekend a month it's his house too he can have visitors you can't say no", "YTA \n\nIF he's paying rent like you do, he' s entitled to visits (preferably announced visits). Take it this way, if they stay together you have visitor for a weekend once per month, if they break up, according to your agreement he could bring different girl every night of the week :D Much better even for you this way, you should root for them to be together :D", "If she is coming over and eating all of your food, or camping out in the bathroom, or playing the TV or music loud until 2 am, or calls you names, or engaging in bad behavior consistently, you would have a basis for complaining. But if she just comes for essentially a long weekend once a month and behaves well, you have no reason to object. YWBTA if you did.", "appreciate you taking the feedback to better the situation. hope everything goes well.\n\nand who knows! if they end up together long term you\u2019ll always be seen as the initial supportive friend who helped their relationship blossom", "4 days a MONTH?\n\n4 days a week would be a problem, but a month? Which is probably planned on advance so it's not a surprise to you.\n\n\nSorry, YTA on this one.", "NTA- Your lease has language that limits overnight guests; if you wanted to be petty, you could check the lease and see how many nights overnight guests are allowed to stay...", "Hey, just wanted to say Im glad you're receptive to the advice given here. You obviously want to be a good friend and roommate and that's what is most important.", "Yeah dude, that\u2019s not controlling. In fact not only is it reasonable, but it should be EXPECTED in a roommate situation. She\u2019s got the right to know when and who is gonna be entering a space that she too pays to live in. She deserves privacy and safty just as much as you.", "Did she even once tried to tell you not to? How it's controlling to know when she can meet a stranger in common areas? It's common courtesy.", "I think OP gets it now", "remember that you are not OP's mum", "the issue is she won\u2019t do the same thing, and we\u2019re not in common areas, nor is she at home when we\u2019re over ( she\u2019s literally never here since her parents live in the same town)", "yes she has, she said she had a problem with me seeing him so often, i see him daily but we\u2019re only at mine maybe once a week bc i just go to his. then when i started never bringing him over she had an issue with me not being home when she was\n\nalso not a stranger, we\u2019ve all been friends for ab 3 years", "When I have a roommate you need to set boundaries and specifics not just wait for conflict and then have a fight or argument about your desires and wants/needs.\n\nMy girlfriend spent the night almost everyday and my roommate use to have friends over 4 out of 5 nights so we delt with each other and moved on after we couldn't take it", "You\u2019ve already realised you are in the wrong so I\u2019ll just add:\n\n3-4 nights per month isn\u2019t much but what happens if he dates someone in town? A third person who isn\u2019t paying bills staying 3-4 nights per week is a problem. Think about this the next time you have a roommate and make sure that you have it spelled out in the lease what is or isn\u2019t acceptable to you in terms of guests. Don\u2019t be a militant asshole but also make sure you don\u2019t end up paying 50% of rent and utilities when three people actually live there.", "YTA\n\nIt's three nights once a month with the same girl.  If he didn't have the gf, you might end up with three or four random girls in your apartment a week.\n\nYou'll get to know the new gf, it won't be some rando stranger from a bar in your apartment with access to your stuff.  Think about that for a sec.  Wanna know how many times I was robbed by randos that roommates dragged home at 3am with beer goggles on?  Plus, you'll know the dates in advance so you can plan around it.  This is seriously like a dream roommate situation.", "my roommate has her boyfriend over 3 nights every weekend \ud83d\udc80 drives me crazy", "House & belongings are probably even more safe in this scenario than if he was bringing last call randos home from the bar every weekend", "Informing that your boyfriend comes over is different from asking if he can come over.\n\nThe first is a form of courtesy and also a reasonable request. Moreover, it\u2019s not so difficult to comply. Think about going out of the bathroom naked and seeing your boyfriend.\n\nThe second is more about not having the full rights to invite someone in your own house. It may still be ok if you both ask each other if you can have guests. Of course, it\u2019s not ok if you\u2019re the only one asking.", "I know you've already realized, and I really respect that you've taken everyone's feedback and recognized your issues.  So don't take this as additional scolding, I'm just trying to add additional perspectives since you haven't had a roommate in a long time. \n\n\nI want to 100% assure you that 3 nights a month is going to be the bare minimum you'd have to deal with for almost any roommate you could find. You're getting a pretty great deal for only 3 nights a month planned in advance and back to back. Very likely that any other roommate you would have found would be worse about that, most leases allow overnight guests 10-14 days a month. \n\n\nIn my personal life the only exceptions I know of are people who are perpetually single or in a long distance relationship. \n\n\nLiving with roommates is extremely annoying. Your roommate doing something that bothers you does not necessarily mean that it's something they shouldn't do. Living with roommates involves keeping a careful balance of everyone's freedom and comfort, and sometimes that means someones freedom trumps certain comforts. it's very important to pick your battles. \n\n\nHope this doesn't come off as a lecture. As someone who really values personal space and all that, if I wasn't used to living with people I would probably also think that 3 nights is too much.", "NTA Tell the roommate she needs to start paying rent.", "Honestly this is way better than once a week imo, there\u2019s a whole month between visits. I agree YTA.", "It\u2019s nice when these things have a happy ending :)", "I am.  OP never calls."]}
