We'll call him Tristan. Tristan (25M) was always very polite and well spoken, and seemed to be an incredibly sensitive person. We got along very well and I considered him a good friend.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, he texted me saying that he was in a bind and needed help with money. I saw this as a red flag at first, thinking maybe he had been hacked. I decided to text his phone number instead of through Facebook messenger. He responded to questions I asked that only he would know the answer to, so I knew it was him.\n\nHe told me that his mother had just been diagnosed with cancer, and they were drowning in bills between her treatments, utilities and every day expenses, and also said that he was unemployed. I felt he wouldnt have asked for money if it wasnt a dire situation. He asked if I could loan him $200, saying he could pay me back in a few weeks. I was weary, but I trusted him to pay me back when he could. However, I am on disability at the moment due to several health issues. I had the money from some rare books I had sold, and I figured I would get it back. I told him this was all I could spare due to my financial situation. He said he understood and kept thanking me. I sent the money through Venmo and that was that.\n\nThe next day he texted me again asking if I could lend him another $100. At this point, Im irritated and wondering whats up, since I already told him $200 was the absolute most I could spare. I called my friend who helped me join the fraternity, and asked if he knew what was up, and if Tristan had asked other people for money. I explained the whole situation and he agreed something was fishy. He made some calls and found out that not only was Tristan not employed, his mother and father were totally fine financially and had everything covered. Other people had even offered them money and they refused.\n\nWhen I heard this, I might as well have had steam spouting from my ears. I was so mad that I didnt even want to give him my time, attention or energy. I blocked him on Facebook and all other social media. The next day he bombarded my phone with calls and texts, so I blocked his number. All his texts were saying he didnt know what he did wrong to upset me (He doesnt know that I know he lied to me). So the petty me decided to unblock him and let him continue to send messages while I would leave him on read and let him marinate in his own anxiety over the situation. I felt he deserved it. He eventually blocked me.\n\nTonight, he unblocked me and is now trying to talk to me again, saying he wants to remain friends and make amends. I dont want to make amends. I just want him to wallow in his own mess.\n\nSome of my friends said they dont blame me, but a couple others say thats an asshole thing to do.\n\nAITA for not talking to this guy?", "created_utc": 1667607587, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymeztp/aita_for_refusing_to_forgive_someone_who_used_to/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
