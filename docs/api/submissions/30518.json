And it's ok for him to completely take over certain tasks  at this age.. Your husband is in the wrong. And why isn't he making his own school lunches, he is not 8? Cooking can be trickier but cleaning is just a matter if the person cares or is just too lazy.", ">everything I do for him I have been forgetting to do or fucking them up someway.\n\nWell, at FIFTEEN he's old enough to make his own lunches, do his own laundry, pack his own school bags  ... \n\nYou can abdicate and let the men show you how it's done.", "I was making my moms and siblings lunches when I was 8 or 9. I think an easy first step is sitting him down and explain that his lunch and laundry are now 100% his responsibility. He forgot to make lunch? Bummer. He tries to sneak his laundry into your hampers to trick you into doing them? Dump them on the floor of his bedroom. His bathroom is gross? Too bad.\n\nI\u2019d probably lay off the communal chores until he gets you\u2019re not fucking around here and stops being a brat.

I was in charge of my own lunch,  packing my own stuff and laundry since I about hit double digits. Dishes was always a shared thing. Ironing?? Never done in my house and Im in awe of anyone who does it on the regular. \n\n15 is definitely old enough to sink or swim on these tasks. If he or your husband keep taking you for granted I would stop making the effort in this entirely. Laundy? Cleaning? Naw its time to take up a super cool hobby and they can take care of themselves.", "I think a better route would be to make him do a chore until it is done correctly.  If he fucks it up, he has to completely restart the chore.  You're trying to indirectly push consequences on him, but you need to be more direct and forceful.  He does not get privileges like going out or gaming until chores are done.  If he \"can't\" do a chore, he will spend all day every day doing that chore until he is successful at it.  Refusal to do chores gets more chores added and more privileges removed.  Having a mom that does laundry for you and makes your lunch at 15 is absolutely a privilege I'd be removing until he decides he values you and your labor.  Personally, I'd give those chores over to him completely even if he does fix his attitude.", "Ok not really relevant but you have a 15yr old son who cares if his clothes are ironed?

He\u2019s too old for that.\n\nGenuinely. My mom stopped making lunch and breakfast for me in first grade. I made my own. She stopped doing my laundry in 4th grade. 15 is old enough to feed himself.", "Right? This behavior isn\u2019t out of left field. So like I said, if husband also doesn\u2019t help time to be drastic.", "Son isn't doing his chores, husband doesn't agree with mom trying to get the son to do chores, therefore it's pretty safe to assume the husband thinks his son doing chores isn't necessary because women cook and clean men don't.

I assure you that his Minecraft skills have not suffered in the slightest. He is *definitely* still a kid.\n\nRemind your husband that in 3 years your son could potentially move out. When is he going to learn this stuff if not now?", "Yes, kids do do chores, and I don\u2019t think it takes away from the childhood in the least.  It builds character and a sense of responsibility, and even younger kids get that - like dressing themselves or looking out for their younger siblings.  But 15 is that point where you cannot really hide behind things.  15 year olds also have jobs.  Your husband is treating your son literally with kid gloves, and your son will suffer for it.  But if he does that, then why not just treat your son completely as a child and micro manage him? \n\nYour view is much better, I think, because it is well balanced.  At the very least, your kid deserves what you are doing simply for lying to and gaslighting you. So it\u2019s amazing that your husband thinks he did absolutely nothing wrong - because, let\u2019s face it - your kid was/is being an AH in several ways, and your husband seems totally fine with it. Just for that, your husband scores negatively as a parent.", "I think the issue is that you're purposefully sabotaging your son by doing chores incorrectly.\n\nMy advice is: stop doing chores for your son. If he needs clean clothes, he can figure it out. He'll do his own laundry wrong 1 or 2 times and have to wear them to school, and he'll stop doing them wrong.", "Unfortunately for some people kids being kids means having all the free time to do nothing like when they were toddlers.", "Ask him why, then.", "The bigger problem here is that your husband is reinforcing your son's disrespect of you.  NTA", "So that is something you should really sit down and have a talk with your husband about. Because I would genuinely *need* to understand if I were in your situation. I would need to understand why he doesn't support it and what he thinks should be done instead. Because doing 'nothing' isn't the answer, either.\n\nHowever, maybe now the point has been made to your son, he takes over chores again but also has to deal with the consequences if he messes them up. *He* has to fix or redo, etc. You aren't going to fix it for him. You can 'guide' him in how to fix it - but he has to do it. Including fixing up anything he 'messes up' again trying to 'fix' it.\n\nBasically, make it clear he isn't getting out of being responsible - so he can either do it right the first time, or end up spending even more of his own time/effort fixing it.", "You should remind your husband that your son will be an adult in less than 3 years. I was in school, doing chores AND working part-time when I was 15.", "I don't want to be the \"kids have it so easy these days\" person, but sometimes it blows my mind looking at what my grandparents suffered through  (my grandpa worked in the coal mines when he was single digits to support his family) and what parents now adays are acting like it's insane to ask of kids.  Don't get me wrong, child labor is bad, don't want kids working in the coal mines, but 15yr old can handle doing his laundry.  It's not going to destroy his childhood.  I moved to a west coast city from ruraralish Michigan and it blew my mind how many people thought teenagers having a job was a bad thing.  When I was a teenager we WANTED to get a job.", "And he should be winning stupid prizes. \n\nThat's how many of us learn.", "I don\u2019t understand what you are saying, so because he\u2019s 15 it\u2019s excused that he\u2019s just lying to get out of things?", "Doesn't mean he gets to win every time though eh!", "Yes, and then he wins the stupid prizes.  Then he learns to play less stupid games.  This is how this works.", "Communication is the key to relationships.  Though sometimes, no matter how you phrase it, communication will still break down.  We've all been teenagers and we've all had our moments of being spoiled, entitled, and rebellious bastards (at least once in our lives, we've all died on a hill we DIDN'T even want to be on). \n\nBut as the parent, you still have a job to educate your kids.  To help them grow up to be the best person they can be.  What do you do when they clearly won't listen?  Do you yell at them?  Call them names?  Let them do whatever it is they're doing and come back to it later, hoping they'll listen then?  Ground them a day?  Two days, once you realize it didn't make a difference?  A week, since it still isn't working? \n\nWhile talking things out is the most efficient solution, sometimes punishments are necessary.  And the Most effective ones are the ones that affect convenience.  Such as a phone.  Knowing your kid is safe is the main use for letting teens have phones.  They only need to be able to make calls.  Anything after that is a privilege, not a right.  Updating your reddit post isn't life or death.  You can take the phone, but they won't have a phone to use in the event of an emergency.  Plus, getting them to willingly hand over the phone is an ordeal all on its own. \n\nSo instead, go straight to the source.  Temporarily disable data.  Revoke Wi-Fi privileges to the device.  Simple and you can avoid the argument of why it is so unfair that is meant to wear you down so that you'll give in because you simply don't want to hear it anymore.\n\nParenting will always be complicated and difficult. Your kids should never be sent to bed hungry.  Should never be hit. Or called names. Which is why getting creative with consequences isn't a bad thing.  The most effective consequences are often the ones that inconvenience and annoy you the most.", "Where did that person say their kids are in no contact?\n\nAlso, why is this used as a threat?

Nice try.", "i chawed on them as a kid can confirm texture is phenom", "Our son took 8 hours to sweep down a driveway. It wasn't a mile long country driveway either. It was a suburb driveway, could hold 4 cars but still....8 hours? We allowed him to take breaks and eat a couple of meals but kept reminding him that he WAS finishing it up, even if he had to do it after dark.  Next time he did it, less than an hour. Still too long but (shrug)", "My dad was the same. And you went nowhere and did nothing until it was done correctly. And it was old school, so he'd stand there menacingly with his belt - always raised it, never used it. The fear was ample enough. Today, it's impossible for me to do anything half-assed if others are going to see it. It made me an anxious overachiever, but rather be that than some entitled asshole, which is where this brat is headed fast.", "No win situation there", "Add a chore for every chore she doesn\u2019t do or does poorly. But, sit down at the table with her and tell her in a formal meeting you are doing this before implementing the rule. Tell her you know she\u2019s trying to get out of work, so she will get the opposite every time. \n\nThen follow through. Every time.\n\nMy friend\u2019s kids always helped her without complaining. I asked her how she had such great helpers and she told me this trick. She said to think about what they are trying to accomplish with unwanted behaviors and try to give them the opposite of that result. It worked like a charm for my kids too, although there was much gnashing of teeth at the beginning.", "Pfft ridiculous! As a former teacher, I assure you 7yr olds can plan for a science lab, gather and organize materials for an entire class, clean up materials, dispose of used items, and store them perfectly clean and neatly in my science closet. Oh an reorganize the closet, add labels to all the shelves, and maintain the hallway bulletin board I do not have time to maintain. In my case they wanted to get out of the less interesting activity options once they finished their classwork and wanted to feel in charge of something, but all my students have done those tasks. Sure some of them needed spell checking and stuff, but 7yr olds are wildly capable. Solidarity, Mom! You've got this!", "At 7 they sometimes seem to want mom to do the most mundane things for them. I'm not entirely convinced it's laziness or weaponized incompetence for them at that age so much as it is wanting moms attention. I was at lunch with a friend once and her 8yr kept asking her questions she already knew the answer to. The adults were talking and it seemed she wanted to be included somehow and didn't know how so she would insist she suddenly no longer remembered how to fill in the coloring/activity page she was working on. Sounds like your kid started out with that and realized that it also had the added benefit of getting out of chores and now she's going full boar.\n\nIf you makes you feel any better I heard when children start figuring these things out it's actually a sing of intelligence. You have a smart kid lol", ">She couldn't remember how to put her dishes in the open and clearly dirty dishwasher after dinner.\n\ntbf my Dad is 72 and still has trouble with this", "LOL - reminds me of when mine was a toddler.

I got planted in front whatever chore needed doing, shown how to do it, and told not to budge til it was done right. If it took 3 minutes or 3 hours... /shrug. Well, that was on me. Since as soon as chores were done I had free time, by the time I was about 7 or 8 I knew better than to try weaponized incompetence nonsense, because that just cut into my play time. I was stubborn, not stupid.  It also taught me efficiency, which has stood me in good stead my whole life long.\n\nShe didn't use the belt thing though, it wasn't necessary.
