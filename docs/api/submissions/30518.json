Your husband is sexist if he thinks this is okay.  I'd be doing the same for husband.  They can both leave the house in wet clothes, have dinners that are over/under cooked (make sure that pasta is crunchy), forget to grocery shop (especially forget all their favorite foods), etc.", "NTA. He leaves wet laundry in the dryer. Move it into a water proof bin and continue on with what you\u2019re doing. \n\nHe wants good complex meals? Sorry. You\u2019re on your own. He\u2019s fucking 15. I was doing way more shit than this at home for myself when I was that age. This is pure laziness.", "Nta hope he shapes up.", "You're NTA, you're just on strike.", "NTA and I actually applaud you for doing this because my mother just dumped my brothers chores on me because he played this crap. Cut to now and he\u2019s 23 still living with her & still doesn\u2019t properly take care of things. Good parents don\u2019t enable their kid\u2019s shitty behavior, they teach them how to be independent. If you want to try adding extra incentive for getting chores done to standard, that could also be a great way to positively enforce when he is getting things done! Teenagers can be difficult\u2014 good luck, mama! \ud83e\udef6", "NTA my parents inspected my chores and I got to redo them if they were not properly done the first time. Learned pretty quick not to mess it up or it would just take longer and longer to fix it.", "NTA- you have a husband problem tho. Does he do his chores or do you do it all? I would either talk to him and be fully honest with him. If you WANT to get a point across to both in a more extreme way, you could just stop cleaning up and cooking except for YOUR things. Cook and buy groceries only for you. Do your dishes and put them up someplace that\u2019s just accessed by you. Do only your laundry. Clean only your things. (If you have pets include them in this obviously please). If he\u2019s under 18, really just do medical stuff for your son and that\u2019s it. Also get him into therapy if you can. There may be more going on but sometimes teens are just not wanting to do stuff and do anything to get out of it. Therapy can still help regardless.", "NTA, but your husband is the biggest asshole and enabler.", "Do kids not do their own laundry at 15 anymore?", "NTA and I applaud you. He'll come around eventually.", "NTA\n\nLol.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  Normally, I'd be advising against childish tactics, but the lack of support from your husband means you don't have any other cards to play (you could compromise with your husband.  If he doesn't have an issue with your son's behavior, then he can can take over your son's chores....). \n\nHere's a couple more aggravating tactics you can use:\n\n1) You can turn off features for specific phone lines, like say, data. \n\n2) \"no data?  Well I got Wi-Fi\".  You can jump on to your router, find a specific device, and click on it to always be rejected access to the internet.  Make sure you change the router password.  Super easy. \n\nExtra credit for you if you want to take it a step further (and learn about networking at the same time).  You can set up the router to always hand specific IP lease configurations to certain devices. In this case, by giving the device in question a bogus DNS address.", "Absolutely NTA. You're teaching your son consequences. Now, make sure there are consequences for his lying, as well!", "Complex food like what? Do you expect him to cook complex dinners daily as a regular chore?", "You don't (just) have a son problem, you have a husband problem.", "NTA.\n\nOh man. At first I was skeptical, like you might be the asshole, but once you overheard him bragging about it, and then he denied it? I can't think of a better tool for the job.\n\nWhat I want, though, is an update. I mean, wet clothes is awesome, and I wanna hear what else you come up with.", "Nice one. NTA", "If you didn't forewarn him that you'd be reciprocating the passive-aggressive behavior to demonstrate a point then you're an asshole too.\n\nPassive-aggressive behavior, silent treatment, lack of trust. Any other dumb shit your family has going on?", "It truly was driving me insane why he was messing up. Like I got messing up or mixing the wrong chemical the first time. But I started to use sticky note. I removed the bleach so he wouldn\u2019t make mustard gas. Like the floor cleaner says floor cleaner and he used it in the sink. I probably should have seen what he was doing sooner but I truely thought he was having issues\n\nWas really really confused", "This. My kids have been doing these things since about age 8.", "I expect him to cook dinner twice a month, complex meals ( they really aren\u2019t complex just require more than two step) like roasted veg and I tried some simple soups", "I did the wet clothes, I didn\u2019t remove the plastic off the cheese slice for his lunch. I forgot how to use an iron for his clothes, his cups that he uses often were washed up in the dishwasher so they filled with dirty water. He forgot to back his book so that stayed on the counter and I didn\u2019t remind him. \n\nReally everything I do for him I have been forgetting to do or fucking them up someway. Im only on day three, he didn\u2019t really notice the first day"]}
