We bought it about three years ago and it is our first home. We love our house. We are both introverted and I have very bad anxiety so having a nice peaceful home is an absolute must. We both work hectic jobs and I work nights so our schedules can be very stressful sometimes and our home is our only chill space. We also have a daughter who is in school. About a year and a half ago we asked my parents to move in with us. They were wanting to relocate and we were needing help with our daughter on the days she was not in school. The arrangement made was supposed to be that they would stay with us about 6 months while they found a place to live and would watch our daughter when she was out of school in return. We were also promised that they would help contribute to groceries and bills and other household needs. This was all discussed in full before they moved in. Well that was 1.5 years ago now. For the first 4 months everything was going great. We all got along, they helped out, they respected our home, and it was really nice having them around. However starting month 5-1.5 years things have went downhill at a rapid rate. They do not help with anything around the house- cleaning, dishes, bills, groceries. Nothing. They also create chaos. My mom doesn\u2019t work and is home all day everyday. Still she will not watch our daughter so we had to find another babysitter. When my dad is home they sleep all day and then are up all hours of the night cooking food for themselves, doing their laundry, taking showers, etc. They make so much noise that they end up waking our daughter up multiple times a night. We have had multiple conversations about them needing to find their own place but they just ignore it or start yelling. Everything has gotten to a point where I am constantly anxious, having panic attacks, fighting a lot with my husband, and having to clean up after them like teenagers. It all came to a head on Thanksgiving when my daughter asked a question and my mom started yelling at her. My husband got very mad and told them they needed to move out and do it soon. My husband and I had been talking about two days prior about me finding a way to tell them to move out after the holidays but after everything that happen that night it all unfortunately came out on Thanksgiving. I think my parents expected me to go against my husband and tell them they can stay but I stand with my husband. Our lives have been a mess for the past 1.5 years and most problems have been rooted in stuff they did. I told them they have to move out and soon.

It wasn't great that this all came out during a holiday, but the cat's out of the bag now. You are not an AH for wanting them to move out, but how you manage the conversations to get that to happen could transform you into an AH. I suggest seeing if there is a (free) community mediation center in your area if your parents don't immediately start looking for a place after the thanksgiving fiasco.

If you find yourself (or your husband) having volatile conversations with your parents regarding them leaving, getting a neutral to help you resolve the conflict can help.", "NTA", "NTA - they essentially took your agreement and tore it up and turned into your home into their personal dumping ground.  Check the local laws to make sure you don't have any issues about \"implied tenancy\" and give them a short deadline to make other arrangements before you boot them straight out the door.

My husband and daughter are my life and no one comes before them. It took me way longer to open my eyes to what was going on than it should have. I swept issues under the rug to save myself stress but in return I put stress on my marriage and my husband and daughter. I am very aware of all of this now and am trying to make sure my husband and daughter are not going to be put under anymore stress from all of this."]}
