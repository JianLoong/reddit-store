About a year and a half ago we asked my parents to move in with us. They were wanting to relocate and we were needing help with our daughter on the days she was not in school. The arrangement made was supposed to be that they would stay with us about 6 months while they found a place to live and would watch our daughter when she was out of school in return. We were also promised that they would help contribute to groceries and bills and other household needs. This was all discussed in full before they moved in. Well that was 1.5 years ago now. For the first 4 months everything was going great. We all got along, they helped out, they respected our home, and it was really nice having them around. However starting month 5-1.5 years things have went downhill at a rapid rate. They do not help with anything around the house- cleaning, dishes, bills, groceries. Nothing. They also create chaos.

We have had multiple conversations about them needing to find their own place but they just ignore it or start yelling. Everything has gotten to a point where I am constantly anxious, having panic attacks, fighting a lot with my husband, and having to clean up after them like teenagers. It all came to a head on Thanksgiving when my daughter asked a question and my mom started yelling at her. My husband got very mad and told them they needed to move out and do it soon. My husband and I had been talking about two days prior about me finding a way to tell them to move out after the holidays but after everything that happen that night it all unfortunately came out on Thanksgiving. I think my parents expected me to go against my husband and tell them they can stay but I stand with my husband.
