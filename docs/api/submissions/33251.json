{"id": 33251, "submission_id": "18kt2n8", "title": "AITA for saying \"I told you so\" after my teacher falsely accused me of drinking beer?", "selftext": "My parents immigrated to America from Kazakhstan/Russia when I was a kid, I went back and forth between the US, Kazakhstan and Moldova, I'm currently finishing high school here in the US. There are many Russian grocery stores in Glendale which my parents periodically go to and I get to consume all my favorite childhood goodies such as Krokant, Alenka, and Kvas. Kvas is a drink, kind of like juice but made out of dark bread. Its sweat and tastes good, it does look a little bit like beer and it even makes foam and sizzles (Idk if thats the right word) like beer but it doesn't taste like it nor does it smell like it. \n\nI have been bringing bottles or cans of Kvas to school usually about once a week or so and never had an issue for several months. A few classmates made jokes saying it looked like beer, I explained it wasn't, let them try some, most found it gross and that was it. Its an acquired taste so its not surprising they wouldn't like it. We had a new teacher join the school a few weeks ago and she's a massive bitch, she always looks for ways to yell at people. She'll hear about a student who got in trouble and find a way to involve herself in the situation and berate the student. She mocks students all the time for petty reasons. She runs the aftercare and she routinely puts kids in timeouts for hours if she finds them annoying. She turned the aftercare into a prison basically during rona by not allowing kids to do anything for 3 hours or however long it lasts. Kids couldn't interact with each other, play with toys or do anything other than read a book in isolation from each other. She is a fucking bitch\n\nShe saw me drink Kvas and it was almost empty. She asked me to give it to her and I said no. I took a large sip finishing the whole thing and she yelled \"I AM NOT GOING TO ASK AGAIN, GIVE ME THE BEER CAN\" and I said \"this is not beer its Kvas\" and she said to give it or i'll be getting detention. I told her to go ahead do it. She yelled at me for disrespecting and disobeying her. She walked away and came back with the principal and she told the principal that I'm drinking beer. I kept the can and the principal looked at it and it was written in Russian. I told him that its kvass, a nonalcoholic drink. The bitch said \"he's probably lying, how do we know its written in Russian\" so I then said \"look I'll put these words in google translate\" and I typed the words that were on the can, \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0441, \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439. See, no alcohol. The principal googled kvas and was reading a wikipedia article on it and he said \"this kid is fine, I got a meeting to attend\" and he walked off. \n\nShe looked furious and I said \"I told you so, are you satisfied now or is there something else you wanted to talk to me about? oh that's what I thought\". She walked off but I think she's going to be watching out for me. \n\nSome people at my table said I was unecessarily rude but most people laughed and told me this was great because she's such a bitch", "created_utc": 1702852029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kt2n8/aita_for_saying_i_told_you_so_after_my_teacher/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good thing you kept the can, so you could prove to the principal that it was non-alcoholic. Who knows if she would have thrown it away and just told him she saw you drinking beer, and if he would have believed her at her word.", "This. NTA, but I'd watch it around her. I've had a mean spirited teacher like that before, and they will absolutely try to undermine you if they have the chance. Through isolating you from other students and certain activities, targeting you for wearing supposedly \"inappropriate\" clothes, but also through your work (ie unfairly giving you lower grades out of sheer dislike for you. Good luck trying to prove that one, though, being a kid lol), etc."]}
