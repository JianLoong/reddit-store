{"id": 33251, "submission_id": "18kt2n8", "title": "AITA for saying \"I told you so\" after my teacher falsely accused me of drinking beer?", "selftext": "My parents immigrated to America from Kazakhstan/Russia when I was a kid, I went back and forth between the US, Kazakhstan and Moldova, I'm currently finishing high school here in the US. There are many Russian grocery stores in Glendale which my parents periodically go to and I get to consume all my favorite childhood goodies such as Krokant, Alenka, and Kvas. Kvas is a drink, kind of like juice but made out of dark bread. Its sweat and tastes good, it does look a little bit like beer and it even makes foam and sizzles (Idk if thats the right word) like beer but it doesn't taste like it nor does it smell like it. \n\nI have been bringing bottles or cans of Kvas to school usually about once a week or so and never had an issue for several months. A few classmates made jokes saying it looked like beer, I explained it wasn't, let them try some, most found it gross and that was it. Its an acquired taste so its not surprising they wouldn't like it. We had a new teacher join the school a few weeks ago and she's a massive bitch, she always looks for ways to yell at people. She'll hear about a student who got in trouble and find a way to involve herself in the situation and berate the student. She mocks students all the time for petty reasons. She runs the aftercare and she routinely puts kids in timeouts for hours if she finds them annoying. She turned the aftercare into a prison basically during rona by not allowing kids to do anything for 3 hours or however long it lasts. Kids couldn't interact with each other, play with toys or do anything other than read a book in isolation from each other. She is a fucking bitch\n\nShe saw me drink Kvas and it was almost empty. She asked me to give it to her and I said no. I took a large sip finishing the whole thing and she yelled \"I AM NOT GOING TO ASK AGAIN, GIVE ME THE BEER CAN\" and I said \"this is not beer its Kvas\" and she said to give it or i'll be getting detention. I told her to go ahead do it. She yelled at me for disrespecting and disobeying her. She walked away and came back with the principal and she told the principal that I'm drinking beer. I kept the can and the principal looked at it and it was written in Russian. I told him that its kvass, a nonalcoholic drink. The bitch said \"he's probably lying, how do we know its written in Russian\" so I then said \"look I'll put these words in google translate\" and I typed the words that were on the can, \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0441, \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439. See, no alcohol. The principal googled kvas and was reading a wikipedia article on it and he said \"this kid is fine, I got a meeting to attend\" and he walked off. \n\nShe looked furious and I said \"I told you so, are you satisfied now or is there something else you wanted to talk to me about? oh that's what I thought\". She walked off but I think she's going to be watching out for me. \n\nSome people at my table said I was unecessarily rude but most people laughed and told me this was great because she's such a bitch", "created_utc": 1702852029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kt2n8/aita_for_saying_i_told_you_so_after_my_teacher/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good thing you kept the can, so you could prove to the principal that it was non-alcoholic. Who knows if she would have thrown it away and just told him she saw you drinking beer, and if he would have believed her at her word.", "This. NTA, but I'd watch it around her. I've had a mean spirited teacher like that before, and they will absolutely try to undermine you if they have the chance. Through isolating you from other students and certain activities, targeting you for wearing supposedly \"inappropriate\" clothes, but also through your work (ie unfairly giving you lower grades out of sheer dislike for you. Good luck trying to prove that one, though, being a kid lol), etc.", "NTA - You're not the asshole, she is And obviously it has no desire to learn what other cultures might enjoy. Which also probably makes her a xenophobe.\n\nA lot of teachers hate being corrected by their students. I hated about 2/3 of my teachers. But I'm well above average intelligence and I was into computers very early (I'm 52) so we had some very stupid teachers who didn't know a thing about what they were teaching. \n\nI will always remember this really snide obnoxious teacher in a computer class that came up to me and interrupted my required work because they couldn't get something to work, and since \"I knew so much\" I should be able to do it.\n\nI glared at her, and never breaking eye contact walked over the other computer hit three keys and walked back to my desk, never even looking at the screen and went back to work she still doesn't know why it worked for me, but it did drive home that I didn't just think she was an idiot when it came to technology, I could demonstrate it.\n\n Things get better when you start taking a master's degree program because some of the students do know more than the teachers and the teachers are in a position to be able to accept that and move on. \n\nI'm a bit Asperger's and this was before I really learned how to deal with stupid people better.   Now I work with mostly engineers, and love most of my co-workers.  What a big part of my job is explaining technology to complete neophytes and I've become far more tolerant. But most of the people in my company have some desire to understand what they're doing.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised the principal is ok with how she runs the aftercare. Unless he doesn\u2019t know?", "Afaik, kvas has some alcohol in it (when I buy here in Russia, it usually says sth like \"not more than 1.2% ethanol\" or so).        \nCan't rly get drunk with it though, yet I heard cases of drivers failing cops alco-test because of it.          \nAnyway, NTA.", "Not the asshole, but it certainly wasn\u2019t smart either. Intelligence is knowing when to keep your mouth shut.", "You had already won at that point. NTA, bur certainly unnecessary.\n\nalso, why are you drnking in class?", "NTA. She fully deserved that. Respect is earned, and she hasn't earned it. You need to be civil and polite from here on out though. She is going to try to cause trouble for you, I can guarantee that. Watch your step.", "NTA", "NTA. Just watch yourself from now on. She'll find something to get you in trouble for if you're careless. That's regardless of the \"i told you so\" comment because she must have felt humiliated not having the principal side with her. Try not to be alone with her if possible. Always have witnesses.", "NTA, she had it coming.", "I try not to do this but\n\n\"this kid is fine. I've got a meeting to go to\"\n\nsounds like a kid telling a story about how he one upped someone he doesn't like.\n\nIt's possible but ehh doesn't feel like it\n\nAnyway, NTA if this is real", "As a former teacher, I relish this kid's sarcasm, which the teacher in question more than earned. She's mean because she's scared of kids and people like that really shouldn't be teaching. With any luck, she'll find a new career, one in which she has no authority and is not allowed to interact with other people, ever. Gravedigger, maybe? Or she could live in a cave and grow mushrooms? I dunno. Just get her away from kids.", "I got to Kvas dor the first time this last week. It is really good. Kinda tastes like a fruity stout. It is made from rye bread, sweetener, and some rasins for flavor and natural yeast. It \"brews\" in about a week and if you do it right it self carbonates. I will be trying to make my own soon.", "My parents are Russian: it is pretty terrible imo, tastes like a sourish bread soda. To each their own I suppose", "The word you\u2019re looking for is *biased*", "Kvas is pretty good actually, it's nice and sweet.", "\u201cHey bro, lemme copy your homework\u201d\n\n\u201cYea no problem, just change it a little\u201d", "Depends on brand we've got some here I'm small Russian shops that have less then .2%.", "Dome teachers are really only in the profession to powertrip. Goes to any kind of position with power over other , and this one is definitely that kind. The sarcasm is well earned.", "She immediately got the principal involved on a non-issue so I feel like this could go two ways. \n\nA) This could all be swept under the rug and the teacher could terrorize to her hearts content while continuing to get the principal involved. \n\nB. The principal is now clued into just the kind of teacher this woman is, and is wary of her enough to keep watch.", "There\u2019s a cold summer soup called Okroshka that uses kvas as a broth if you\u2019re into unique soups \ud83d\ude01"]}
