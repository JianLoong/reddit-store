It's not shameful, and doesn't need to be kept a secret. And that last bit sounds like this may be the only time she sees extended family in the year. When would be a good time for her to tell them? Again, it's not shameful & doesn't need to be kept a secret. You're acting like it *is* shameful, or embarrassing. Stop supporting this idea, it's unhealthy for those who suffer from PPD.\n\n> I\u2019ve struggled with mental health for 10 or so years but have never let if affect family affairs.\n\nAnd? Do you want a cookie? Your mental illness & how you cope with it =/= anyone else's journey. Stop comparing. \n\n> She got mad at me & told at least 20 other extended family members that I yelled at her for having mental health concerns (which isn\u2019t at all true).\n\nThis sounds like this is exactly what happened. \n\nAnd where were you having this family get together that your cousin alone was able to cancel it for everybody?", "NTA but I don\u2019t think your cousin is capable of having an adult conversation. It might be best to stay no contact.", "INFO: How was she able to cancel this event if your mom was in charge?   \n\n\nRegardless, NTA at all.

I\u2019m not shaming her PPD or panic attacks, I fully support her recovery and told her to let me know if she needs anything. It\u2019s the fact that anytime even the smallest thing goes wrong in her life, the entire family is thrown into it.", "Yes I LOVE her children. They are angels. And unfortunately will never know many extended family members on our side because she\u2019s caused so many bridges to be burned.", "She made it seem to the rest of our family that she was in the hospital or something.

Absurd question.", "No. I\u2019m mad that she caused family drama because she was angry when my grandparents chose my graduation over her sons birthday. She could have moved the birthday as well to accommodate. A lot of family members were upset when she did this because it\u2019s definitely something she would do on purpose-she does sneaky things like that all  the time.

She could also call in private. We live 4 hours away and some family came in from Florida, California, etc. for that event. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s shameful, I had a long discussion with her that evening about it and sympathized with her, sharing my own mental health experiences and comforting her.", "Depression isn't shameful, but there should still be some tact when bringing it up at a large social event. It sounds like the cousin isn't afraid to bring it up whenever she wants, great that she feels so comfortable discussing it, but I can also see why it would upset some people to see their family for the first time in a year for an uplifting occasion and have someone pull you aside to be the next person on the list to hear about how depressed they are. Is she telling people because she's looking for support? Or because she wants people to pay attention to her instead of the party?", "Even tho you say you judge her mental health issues as separate from who she is as a person (i.e. good or bad), based on the way you wrote the post and some comments, it does not come across that way. \n\nEspecially since you don\u2019t hold your or family accountable for the way they choose to react to her. No one had to cancel the Easter get together. \n\nAgain, there\u2019s no insight or explanation about her being manipulative when you said she forced her sister to stay with her which shut down your grandparents transportation. \n\nWithout something more from you to shed light on her character (a separate component from her mental health), this just appears that you don\u2019t like how exhausting her mental health is and are finding reasons after the fact to support it.", "I\u2019m 0% jealous of her. I have an incredible life that I love, a successful career, amazing friends, etc. she\u2019s actually been jealous of me a lot of our life because I often had things she didn\u2019t.

The only people I could see backing out is her mom and maybe siblings. Why would your  other aunts/uncles/cousins  back out?", "You're still comparing. \"She could do\" followed by what YOU would do. And \"my panic attacks\" don't do this or that. SHE IS NOT YOU. Stop trying to critique if she's doing mental illness the right way.  \n\nRegarding the birthday, maybe she scheduled it for that day because she figured grandparents could do a two-for-one, since they were already here? \n\nShe sounds like she is more comfortable than you are in sharing how she is doing with the family. Is she oversharing? Maybe? But that's not for you to decide.\n\nEach of you has your own mental health struggles. Stop obsessing so much about what cousin is doing, and focus on you. You are not going to be able to change her, and you will be much less stressed if you are able to really understand that.\n\nIt sucks that your family ditched the weekend. But there were other people involved in canceling it, it wasn't entirely the cousin's decision. \n\nI have a mentally ill sibling who definitely has caused her share of drama in the family.

I\u2019ve offered her my comfort and support for it and my shoulder to lean on should she need/want it. I judge how she allows it to affect everyone else around her so frequently and intensely. Here are some examples of her mental health issues:\n1) yells and screams/cries to get her way. Reminder that she\u2019s 30 and still does this.\n2) has her mother watch her children for days on end so she can \u201cclean the house\u201d\u2026for 3 days. \n3) dropped her children off at our other aunt\u2019s home while our mothers and aunt were trying to enjoy one-on-one-on-one time with each other as sisters. Kid free. Left the children without asking if it was ok. \n4) retaliates if she doesn\u2019t get her way.
