Not everyone is your therapist and telling absolutely everyone all the time about all your mental health concerns is not the brave honesty people seem to think it is. I do think your family members need to establish firmer boundaries. Clearly your aunt didn't do a great job establishing them to begin with.

You're really pushing that she's behaving a certain way that isn't appropriate (like updating family about your struggles! What a selfish lady! She should pretend to be okay like we all do!) while also admitting you aren't close. How are you so  certain she is \"Perfectly fine\", while in the same rant saying she's chaos", "I have a feeling you're ignoring some big issues for the sake of playing Happy Families and resent her for not doing the same", "Like my grandparents, who are in their 80s.", "Could you not schedule your own trips to visit these people? It sounds like your problem is piggybacking on other peoples' planning, which means you're then let down when their plans fall through. The fact that this cousin was a linchpin in these plans is your issue, not the fact that she has mental health issues, *so stop making her the linchpin*. Drive yourself up there and see your grandparents!", "YTA", "YTA \"all the women in my family suffer in silence!!! why can't she\"", "I\u2019m not \u201cplaying happy family.\u201d I\u2019m tired of the valuable time I rarely get to spend with family members is almost always compromised by her personal \u201cemergencies\u201d that aren\u2019t all that emergent", "I do! I see them as often as I can and visit other family as well. The whole family was put off by this Christmas party situation because of the way she went about it. But also if we plan to celebrate a major holiday, I\u2019m tired of that getting canceled because of her.", "That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. We don\u2019t suffer in silence. But we don\u2019t create catastrophe on everyone\u2019s part every time something happens.", "To you.", "You and your family deciding that speaking about mental health at a family gathering is not appropriate doesn't make it none appropriate. You don't get to decide that. You can tell her that you don't want to discuss it, but it doesn't make it inappropriate. \n\nHer sister deciding to stay to support her instead of driving your grandparents is not her ruining the event. And you can chose not to invite her to your events, but don't get to uninvite her from everyone's family events.\n\nLast time I check, when Queen Elizabeth died they made Charles king, not you.", "like PPD? is that the something?", "Or anyone besides her immediate family. It should not interrupt time with grandparents/other aunts/other cousins. But it does", "There is a time and a place to talk to people about your mental health struggles, and it's not 'all the time, to every extended family member at Christmas.' A lot of people mistake constantly talking about their mental health with honesty and openness; it's not. Have several close friends and family who you can talk with about these things (and reciprocate) and have more enjoyable conversations with everyone else, unless they specifically ask or bring it up. Not everyone is your therapist.", "I personally won\u2019t invite her to events I\u2019m holding. I was engaged a few years ago (never got married, called off the wedding) and she was not on my guest list. I can\u2019t ask others to do the same, if they want to invite her they can. \n\nIf a majority of my family members were uncomfortable with what she was doing at the event, then yeah I think it was pretty inappropriate. \n\nShe went into the event with the intention of telling everyone about it, one by one, for long periods of time. It was pretty awkward and cringy", "Like a panic attack more than 72 hours before the event takes place\u2026that she was fine the next day from\u2026", "sharing information about your life isn't asking for a therapist just because you find the information uncomfortable. PPD is an issue that needs to be discussed more. especially if people are going to ask about your new baby or how you're handling motherhood at a family gathering.", "I disagree. If anyone asks me how am I, why do I have to lie? 'You know what, I am not at my best, I just had a kid and have PPD' is an acceptable response. It normalizes the fact that people aren't always happy. You don't have to reciprocate. You can say 'Sorry to hear that' and a change of conversation or leave if you're uncomfortable. \n\nWhen we make saying 'I'm not doing so well' taboo, we make the stigma worse.", "No, not everyone is your therapist, but if this was her first time seeing all of these people for a long time and they greeted her and asked \"how've you been?\" that is a perfectly reasonable time to answer \"well to be honest I've been struggling with postpartum depression\". And if it's a large group of people yeah it might look like she was \"going down the line saying it to everyone\" but if that's the truth, why lie? She deserves to be able to tell her family the truth and that she's struggling at the moment. Plus if that's the extent of how much she indulged that's perfectly fine on its own, or if the family member asked for clarification/details, yeah she probably went into more detail, which is also fine.\n\nMy question is why OP was paying such close attention to her cousin that she knows what she said to every. family. member at this \"huge party\". Either she's lying, over exaggerating, or she's way too invested in everything her cousin says or does to the point that she literally followed her within earshot to listen.", "You know what's uncomfortable? Someone who can't even imagine someone else might like to enjoy a party or social gathering without being treated, without even being asked, as an emotional trash can. Yes, it's important to acknowledge ppd and not shame people for having it. What's also true is that, if a person is *also* having a difficult time, it's extremely unpleasant to be forced to let someone vomit their mental health problems all over your without even considering whether or not you're in a place to offer support. Supporting people is a two way street, and it really sounds like the cousin has no idea of this.", "No one asked, she was interrupting other conversations to pull people aside for the purpose of telling them about it", "She WAS going down the line. My grandfather had to tell her to stop because she was literally interrupting other conversations for that specific reason. It was a HUGE topic of conversation after the fact and many family members were turned off by it. \n\nThis was not a situation where people were asking her organically how she was doing and she was simply responding."]}
