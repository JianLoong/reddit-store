This was after years of busting his ass in school, in multiple varsity sports, and so on. Needless to say, I\u2019m proud of him. \n\nWhile I was home from college, the family threw a celebration party for him. My uncle, aunt, and cousin who live 30 minutes from our house were invited.\n\n I thought that this sort of celebration might be hard for my cousin, since her parents often give her a hard time for getting bad grades and not being able to get into college while the rest of her cousins got into \u2018prestigious\u2019 colleges, so I went to check in on her. I asked how she was feeling, and she responded that she felt disgusted to have a \u2018dumb brute\u2019 future war criminal in the family. \n\nI know my cousin, and I know that denigrating others accomplishments is how she copes with her own feelings of insecurity. She did it to me when I committed to UChicago, making fun of the fact I\u2019m \u2018paying hundreds of thousands\u2019 for nothing. I actually got good financial aid, but I held my tongue because I knew she had gotten rejected from colleges and hurting. But now, it\u2019s been two years, and she\u2019s insulting my brother, which is different. \n\nI asked if that was how she really felt or if she was just trying to mask jealousy. She tried to respond but stumbled over my words, so I told her that was what I thought and that her jealousy is pathetic. I furthered that I understand the family celebrating other people can be upsetting, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can denigrate what somebody\u2019s worked hard for. She said that everything she said is true, so I asked her if he truly is a dumb brute why did he get into much better colleges than she did?\n\nShe stormed off and reached out later, demanding an apology. I refused to, and everybody in the whole family was upset at her, including her own parents. I feel bad because it\u2019s a hard position to be in to have your own parents be mad at you again, but what she said was out of line so I don\u2019t want to apologize.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681317801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jrzjg/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_her_jealousy_is/", "score": 263, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, since she is family, try to remember that envy is the only sin that brings no pleasure, haha. Your first instinct to be kind is, on balance, the right one, but you were also absolutely right to push back against her vomiting up that toxicity at an event to celebrate your brother.", "NTA. Unfortunately your cousin needs to learn that denigrating others will not make her better in school. She should focus her attention on more controllable outcomes", "NTA.

You are right and you seem compassionate, so I offer this other side commentary.\n\nTake your brother and yourself out of it. Just look at her life.  She\u2019s not great at school but that\u2019s the bar her parents have set to be proud of her.  So she\u2019s constantly falling short.  That hurts.\n\nMaybe she doesn\u2019t like classes, or get the content, or she has interests in completely different areas.  But fundamentally there is an assumption on the part of your family that this is the route to success so she\u2019s not on it.\n\nI bet she does have things she\u2019s great at, just not grades.  Or maybe she just doesn\u2019t want an office lifestyle or other aspect.  Her choices should be respected too and while it\u2019s hard to let someone do what you think is failing, it\u2019s way worse to make them feel that they don\u2019t have their families support.  That breeds resentment, like what you and your brother have experienced.  \n\nIs she right in how she\u2019s acting? Absolutely no.

I get the sense that you could have had this conversation without calling her pathetic...
