He\u2019s just looking for something to fuck and to pad his ego. Not to mention being unfaithful to his wife. These situations, if they keep going, usually end up in some form of controlling and manipulative relationship. I don\u2019t blame your friend that much. She\u2019s naive simply for the fact that she has such little life and dating experience and he\u2019s being a creep and should know better.          \nAs I always tell the young women around me that I know (I\u2019m 48f) you have no idea how beautiful you young girls are. Your skin is glowing, fresh and tight. There are scores of older guys just like your uncle who would absolutely take advantage of you to hook up. Don\u2019t fall for it. You deserve someone closer to your own age that you can grow with and experience life together. I escaped an age gap relationship when I was in my early/mid 20s so I\u2019m a bit protective of other young women your age. We see stories like that on here.

Do you keep it, or do you expose it to sunlight? I actually think both responses are valid.\n\nBut one thing I will say is this: Do not tell your friends you can keep a secret if you are not the kind of person who will keep the ugly ones.

She broke faith with her friend -  even though her friend is definitely wrong. And while I know friends disagree, trying to control a grown person's actions usually results in disrupted friendship. Its not like everything gets reset, her friend appreciates what she did and they go back to being friends. They aren't children.

Why are you going to be hard on a young woman who wasn't sure what the right answer was?", "Oh yea this is totally justified. Hooking up with someone who is your child's age while married is all break no talks for me too.
