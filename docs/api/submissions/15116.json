Changed my judgement to ESH.....Op claims it isn't her place to tell the wife, but telling everyone else is ok??", "His wife needs to know!!", "YTA absolutely.  Not your business.  You decided on a course of action that would both alienate your friend and family, as well as cause no end of problems with everyone involved...  for NO other reason than YOU didn't like it.\n\nAlso, you just lost the trust of EVERYONE involved.

You did the right thing speaking up.", "NTA\n\nYour uncle and your best friend are most definitely TA. Especially your uncle. You did good. If you knew about it and didn't tell people, it would have hurt your aunt and your cousin.", "Yeah the uncle is super gross", "That's so fucked up of you.

If I were your aunt and found out you knew my husband was publicly humiliating me and you didn\u2019t tell me, I\u2019d be beyond pissed. You 21 years old, not a kid who is confused about what to do. I would understand if my son didn\u2019t tell me, because: \n\n1. It\u2019s his father . He might feel that busting his dad is betrayal, and he might receive consequences. \n2. He doesn\u2019t want to hurt his mother. \n3. He doesn\u2019t want to be the catalyst for ending his parents\u2019 marriage. \n\nBut I would truly hope my that my *grown* nephew would have the heart and the courage to tell me. \n\nINFO: If your spouse was cheating on YOU, would you want to know???? \n\nI\u2019m guessing you would, because you think that what your friend and your uncle is doing is wrong and the information *was* shared\u2026\u2026but with your logic in telling just your cousin, maybe you just think your family members have the right to know you are being cheated on, but not YOU\u2026.. ?!??? Explain this logic to us. \n\nThis poor woman is being betrayed and you, while keeping her in the dark, are worried about whether you were an asshole to your unscrupulous *friend* ?????\n\nHoney, NTA for your question, but Y T A  BIG TIME for withholding information from your aunt. \nDoing the right thing isn\u2019t always easy or pleasant, I get it, but that is how life works.\n\nHow in the world do you justify keeping this information from her???", "Because they are also guys and probably deep down wish they could do it too.", "Plus it follows tunnel vision mob mentality anyways which is very common human nature", "I'm single and I still won't even have casual sex with anyone close to my kids age of 20yrs old...", "NTA! You know who the AHs are!", "NTA. What cheaters and those who willingly participate with them don\u2019t seem to grasp is that if party A doesn\u2019t know party B is cheating with party C, then party A is being denied the opportunity to deny informed consent. Party A may be cool with the affair between the two if it were disclosed, or may not want to continue sleeping with party B. But if they don\u2019t know, they can\u2019t refuse consent based off the information. If you can\u2019t refuse informed consent then you can\u2019t give it either. Which makes cheating a form of assault. Is it legally prosecutable? No, not for most of the world. But is it still violating? Fuck yes. If you know someone is cheating, and not telling their partner, you fucking tell their partner or someone that will. It\u2019s not up to you to make them believe it. It\u2019s up to you to not stand by, aware of a violation on someone\u2019s body, without even saying anything. If you choose to do nothing, you\u2019re a bad person because you\u2019re enabling abuse of another human.", "nta", "NTA. Your uncle sucks big time but so does your friend.

Good to see general sexist comments are still acceptable on Reddit if it's against men.", "I came on a bit strong, and I apologize. Your heart is in the right place, and you don\u2019t deserve to get slammed by your cousin, your unscrupulous friend or me. I get that you were unwittingly put in a bad spot, and you don\u2019t want to be involved further. That is completely fair. \nYou were surprised at your cousins reaction, but actually it not uncommon for people to \u201cshoot the messenger\u201d, hence the idiom. \n\nSomehow I missed the info on your aunt being fully aware that her husband is a serial cheater. That completely changes my perspective. If your aunt knows this, and wants to stay in that type of marriage, that\u2019s on her, and IMO you are resolved of responsibility, and are smart to stay out of it further. \n\nHowever: If your aunt had zero idea that her husband was cheating on her, I stand by my assertion that it would be morally correct to give her the information, or find someone else to do it. That\u2019s unless you wouldn\u2019t want to be told yourself if you were in her shoes, because honestly, wouldn\u2019t you feel that was info you deserved to have if *your* partner were cheating, despite other family members\u2019 not wanting you to have it? \n\nI guess it just struck me as odd that you ended with your cheating ass friend thinking you were an AH, and you questioning yourself AT ALL.

Don\u2019t let people with questionable morals, (like her, not your cousin), ever make you question yours. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry your cousin is so angry at you.
