I have never posted them or shown anyone the photos besides my husband and friends, in person. I never thought this was an issue as shes a baby, and I am keeping them private, and she always has bloomers or a diaper or something covering her privates. \n\nWe get to MIL (58) house and throughout the day we talk about the baby and life. We have always been close since me and my husband had dated all throughout highschool. She asks if I had any photos that she could see that I haven't posted on my Instagram. I showed her a photo of my daughter at 7 months old in the bath with flowers around her and a cute headband. She isn't wearing any clothes but I had the flowers placed where you couldnt see her bottom half and she looked very cute. MIL Instantly got mad and yelled at me for having \"Child P*rnography\" of my daughter and said I should be ashamed of myself. \n\nI was very upset because I love my daughter and wouldn't do anything to do that to her and told her that I've never showed them to anyone and shes always covered where it matters, and she replied saying I was evil. So I got up to go to the kitchen and check on the dinner and then to the bathroom to collect myself. While in the bathroom MIL asked my husband for my phone password, which was sitting on the counter, to look at my instagram. She then went through and looked for all of my photos of my daughter and deleted what she could find and recently deleted. I came out to her holding my phone and she swiftly put it down. I went over to see and opened the phone to see the empty recently deleted album. I yelled at her for going through my phone and she then said my husband, who was already confused, gave her permision to delete my twisted photos. He said he didnt and she yelled back \"Fine I guess I'm the only one who sees an issue with naked children being posted on the internet\". \n\nMy husband grabbed the baby and I grabbed the bags and we left the house. We are now at his sisters house and MIL hasnt tried contacting us.

How else are you next to embarrass your children when they bring their first partner home if not to whack out the baby bath pics?? Everyone has these!

Stay away from MIL - she sounds toxic.", "NTA but MiL needs to be cut out. Your husband is not very bright either. Mother and son both suck. \n\nInfo: did you bother knowing either of them before marrying into that family?", "NTA. Your MIL was unforgivably controlling and entitled. Your reaction was well within bounds considering her transgression.", "NTA.  \n\nShe **invaded your privacy.**  She **deleted your photos.**   She **falsely accused you** of posting these on the internet, when she originally asked to see the ones you didn't post.  \n\n**She owes you an apology, for all these things.**  That won't fix this, but it will be a beginning.  A real apology admits what she did wrong, and that she knows why it's wrong. If she can't admit it was wrong and why what she did was wrong, any apology is not real, and you do not have to accept it.", "NTA, look up how to recover the photos on your type of phone. They are recoverable, worst case you need to take it to a tech place and tell them you need all of the photos deleted during this time period. Cut contact and get the pictures back. And maybe put them on a USB or something just in case.", "NTA My parents have a few developed photos of my siblings and me nakey when we were babies/toddlers.

Anne Geddes does pro photos like that all the time and she's famous. As for your pics, they may not be gone for good. Check your icloud ,they may be backed up.on there. Also go into your file folder. Gallery pics get saved there too.", "She's clearly technologically impaired and believes that if it lives on your phone, it must be 'out there on the internet for everyone to see'.\n\nI've taken photos of my 1 year old nephew in the bath, and I will never post them online. I usually take them when I'm babysitting him and text them to his parents to prove he hasn't drowned and is still cute.\n\nYou could try explaining it to her, but I suspect her brain will not be able to grasp the concept. She may also generally just not like you, and so she'll be even more inclined to think the worst of you because she wants to.\n\nThe lesson here is change your passcode, and just don't talk about, share or show her those photos.

I\u2019m a child of the 80s and we literally just ran around in diapers for the first two years of our lives, so nearly all of my toddler faze pictures are me with no shirt.

This is the kind of woman who will baby sit your daughter one day, take her and have her hair cut short \u2018because it\u2019s easier\u2019.   \n\n\nNo one needs this in their lives. MIL needs to pull her head in. It\u2019s not about the photos, it\u2019s about the attitude and actions.

I don't think it's pornography, but if ever gotten into the wrong hands it could be really bad. \n\nNot only that but I have seen photos of myself like that and feel, as an adult, so violated and awkward seeing them. Yes, people think they are 'cute and innocent' but like...that's still a person. They grow up. You wouldn't go and take photos of adults in the bath. \n\nHowever I still don't think you are wrong or evil.", "Are your pictures backed up in cloud? Are they lost forever?\nNTA, gosh I have a picture of my son on a blanket naked (private parts down) with his little buttocks in full view and it was in a frame in my family room for awhile. \nEvery part has these pictures. Your MIL is being weird", "NTA at all. EVERYONE who is a parent has photos like that on their phone. Babies are adorable.\n\nYour MIL is a nut job. And, quite honestly, if she considers normal parental photos of their baby daughter in the tub to be inappropriate than it shows that her judgement is either truly off or perhaps she is a victim of the type of photography she claims your photos are.", "NTA. Why is MIL sexualising an infant? Was she assaulted as a child herself?", "NTA.

Your MIL is a paranoid wack job. You did not post those photos to Instagram anyway! Your husband was also very wrong to give her your phone password.

Thats not the case at all, you have photos of YOUR child in home environments and have only showed them to specific people and didnt send them. MIL is completly out of line here. Plus her deleting those memories are just rediculous!", "Good Lord, half the photos Ann Geddes published are of naked infants.", "You do know that your phone has a trash bin that usually doesnt delete items for 30 days right?  You should find the trash file and restore the photos.\n\nI am curious why your husband thought it was ok to give him mom YOUR password? That is a huge violation of privacy. Seems you might have bigger issues than just your MIL\n\nNTA keep her away from kiddo until she learns some manners", "NTA.\n\nDon't know if you have an iPhone or something else, but in the Photos app on the iPhone, there's a \"recently deleted\" folder.

You may have additional clean up to do but you will have the ones the nightmare in law deleted.", "NTA. Taking pictures of babies and small children naked is very common and completely none sexual. Every partner I've had has had baby photos their mothers have shown me with their genitalia completely seeable simply because nobody has ever thought it'd weird for kids under 4 to have photos like that. I'd be with your MIL if you were posting them publicly, but your not so idk what she's on about.\n\nFor getting the images back see if your phone has a recently deleted tab.", "I'm probably showing my age here, but a very long running joke was to take out the photo albums and show a first date the naked baby pictures. \n\nOr hang the bare butt baby pics. \n\nWTF is wrong with people????", ">We have always been close since me and my husband had dated all throughout highschool.\n\nBut still, Husband would never know my code again if he's just going to tell it to anyone who fucking asks!

I get that people think it's 'cute and innocent' but I do think it's really weird. You don't just go around taking photos of adults in baths so why children?\n\nIt's not pornography, however, if the photos were to get into the wrong hands....I've seen people literally post these photos onto social media.", "I'm in my forties, and my parents have pictures of me and my sister in the tub.  \n\nI don't share photos of my young nieces, but I wouldn't be upset if their parents did.", "Yup and before it was on the phone people took them on film!
