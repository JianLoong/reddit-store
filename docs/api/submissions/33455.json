In engagement, the ring is given with the expectation of entering a marriage contract. No marriage contract, return the ring. However, that doesn\u2019t apply to your situation. You entered your marriage contract. So the rings are yours. The only exception to this I would say is probably a family heirloom with expectation that it would be passed down.

Good luck", "Yta, sounds like he\u2019s watched judge Judy, he\u2019s  technically right.", "NTA, but is it worth it?\n\nYou are definitely entitled to the rings, legally and otherwise. If he's going to claim you didn't fulfill the promise, I'm guessing he didn't uphold his vows either. But regardless, is this going to drag out the divorce? Or will it set some kind of precedent so he'll try to take more things that he's not entitled to?", "This is a great question, and honestly I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d like to say yes, but there\u2019s also so much bad blood around this kind of thing with him (the \u201cI bought it so it\u2019s mine\u201d type of issue was common in our marriage) so I don\u2019t know that I would no matter how politely he had asked, unless he had a compelling reason as to why he wanted it.", "I appreciate this perspective. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not engaging in a back and forth with him. He asked, I said no, he continued texted, I told him I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it further with him. Also I\u2019m not withholding the ring just because I want to upset him. It\u2019s more to do with his historical behavior and not wanting to let him have the power to demand things from me and me just caving when he doesn\u2019t actually have a right to that thing from me. \n\nAll that said, I still think it\u2019s on the petty side and I understand, respect, and appreciate your YTA judgement.", ">He sounds like a big baby\n\nShe doesn't want the ring except to annoy him.  She's the big baby", ">It sounds like he just wants to sell it & keep the money for it himself.\n\nDoes it?", "Engagement ring is hers once they are married!

Once the marriage happens, the rings are yours.", "She doesn't sound like someone worth celebrating", "Ugh, that really sucks.\n\nSo\u2026normally, I\u2019d say NTA, keep the rings, and good riddance to the ex. But there is a kid involved and you\u2019re going to be stuck coparenting with him, so (as you already know) things are more complicated. What I\u2019m going to say is still NTA but move cautiously. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d sell the rings to a reputable jeweler and set up a college fund (that he can\u2019t access) for your kid with the proceeds. That will make it really tricky for him to paint you as The Evil Greedy Ex, since the funds are for the benefit of your shared kid.", "NTA. Legally, they are yours. Psychologically, they are yours and even discussing this with your ex reinforces his sense of entitlement to make demands of you regardless if they are valid. You said no and that you'd not discuss it further and that's enough attention to the little guy.", "Admittedly I Googled it and there were a few answers. They were pretty varied but I went with the one that seemed the most well reasoned. The answers I saw spread from it being the wife's for the reason you outlined to it was the husband's because it was a \"conditional\" gift. That didn't make much sense to me. But the one about it being marital property actually made some sense. I think the engagement ring is almost certainly considered the other person's property. But the wedding ring is given at the wedding and it made sense to me that it would belong to \"both\".", "What states? I know back in the days engagements were considered contracts to marry but not anymore. I\u2019ve never heard of a state/judge stating this in present day. All the cases I read in my family law class back in law school said the opposite. The engagement rings were considered gifts and the did not need to be returned to the other spouse", "Great response!", "Okay I had my own response typed out, (I was focused on the fact that she didn't want the ring and wasn't even going to sell it) but this is a great idea. If OP goes with this option it eliminates any pettiness on her part. This is the answer.", "This is a fantastic idea that I hadn\u2019t thought of. Thank you.", "California for one. Engagement ring is a conditional gift. Condition is marriage. But my original comment doesn't matter. They were married.", "Good luck!", "Ah okay, yeah.", "ESH -- he should not have an attitude of \"I bought them so they belong to me\" but on the other hand, he is clearly hurt (gave them under the pretense of marriage til death but you're leaving him) and since they mean nothing to you, you're just being spiteful for keeping them.", "Oof. This is a hard one.  There's a lot of legal issues that other redditors have already talked about so I won't mention those. (Although I Completely Urge You to Listen to the redditors who said to document what you choose to do with the rings.)  \n\nYou made it very clear that YOU chose to divorce and that he's having a hard time accepting in reaction.  Honestly?  My instinct would be to give him the rings.  Symbolically, they are a representation of a marriage you entered into with him and are now walking away from one-sidely by your own admission.  Why keep them and mistakenly foster hope in this man that you may change your mind or still care?  Cut the cord entirely by handing over the rings.  Be happy that the cost of putting a final end to any hope in his mind is so cheap and easy.", "A engagement ring is legally \u201ca gift in anticipation of marriage\u201d \n\nThe marriage occurred-the ring is yours.", "NTA.

Sell the rings and put it in a college/education  fund for the kid.", "Going a bit against consensus here, but I think it depends on why you chose to leave. I generally think that, regardless of the legal stuff around gift-giving, you would be TA for keeping them when you're the one leaving. UNLESS there was abuse or infidelity involved - in that case, do what you want with them.", "YTA only because of your reason.  If the ring means nothing to you but it does to him, why not return them?  I think he's an ass for asking but at least he has a reason that can make sense.  You are juat being petty.  You have a child, do better.  This doesn't mean give him the ring - it just means don't be stupid about the ending of your marriage.  Clearly you made the choice and are ready to move forward.  The fact that he is not and being stupidly reactive doesn't mean you need to behave like a fool.

Most times in a divorce, a judge will allow a person to keep their engagement and wedding bands because it\u2019s considered a gift.  Sometimes if a prenup has been signed, the rings will have to be returned.  Now, should you choose to return the rings, that is entirely up to you.

That means you need to be willing to compromise and be respectful of the other person's wishes too for the child's sake. If you don't care about the ring then why are willing to die on this hill?", "NTA.\n\nThey were gifts.  There are only 3 scenarios I think a woman should be compelled from a moral standpoint to return. 1) Affair.  If your infidelity broke up the marriage, do the right thing. 2) You fell out of love through no fault of the spouse.  He was a good guy that treated you well and was loyal but you lost the spark. 3) Either the engagement or wedding ring is a family heirloom.  He should be able to give to a son or other family member in future.", "Don\u2019t give it back. \nHe\u2019s an ass. \n\nSell them. In another state. \nTake the money and run. \n\nWhen he inquires about the rings, reply \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about!\u201d \n\nRepeat that phrase over and over. That is the only response to everything he says to you. \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about.\u201d \n\nIt will drive him insane.", "An engagement ring is the promise to marry, that happened. I would get him to acknowledge a value for the ring and then say he can have it for that price. It\u2019s all a numbers game anyways. He gets it but has to give up something of that value.", "Once you're married they're yours to keep. Personally I sold mine back to the jeweler wher they came from. He tried talking me into making something for my kid but I didn't want to. We got divorced I don't want her to have any sort of that bad juju. \nYour soon to be ex is just reaching for things. But you're right. They are yours", "NTA. They are yours.", "No judgement\n\nHonestly, you should be speaking with your lawyer about this, not Reddit. \n\nIf he wants the rings back, tell him to tell his lawyer and you'll work it out that way. If you hand them over now he'll just make another stupid demand and throw a temper tantrum.\n\nGive nothing, accept nothing unless ok'd by a lawyer.", "NTA  Tell him to ask for them through his attorney in the divorce papers but you will be making a request through your attorney in the divorce for something that you want also.", "I know that in the case of a friend of mine, his lawyer had them deemed marital assets because of the value of them.  I'm not sure of everything else that was going on, but it wasn't an amicable divorce.", "He's right in that engagement rings are conditional gifts (at least in Australia), but I don't know if that applies once you've actually gotten married (ie if you broke up before the wedding, you'd have to return the ring). BUT, if he gave you the ring for Christmas/birthday, then it's not a conditional gift.\n\nI'd check with the lawyer to be safe. If you do have to give him the rings, he has to return his wedding band to you.\n\nI don't know who's right, but NTA", "Nope.  Once you marry they are yours.\n\nLock them up.", "If you don't want it, use it as a bartering chip for something you do want!\n\nNTA", "NTA- keep the rings. They are yours. My sister repurposed the stones.", "NTA.\n\nHere's a funny for you: when my ex and I divorced, it was like you mostly fine, but ooh boy when it wasn't. So we agreed on all the stuff and probably would have done self done no contest, but he bought a house while we were separated so wanted a lawyer to go over the thing. No problem, I didn't want any part of the house and agreed as long as the paperwork said what we agreed I'd sign. \n\nThen he calls me up one day that he was going to \"contest the divorce\". I told him \"I'm pretty sure since you filed, you can't contest, maybe you can withdraw it and we can start over with the process? What's the goal here?\". I dunno if he was just pissed off at himself, drunk, or what. Anyhow the divorce went through easy peasy.\n\nI swear sometimes people just have a temper tantrum because their own actions resulted in exactly what anyone would expect.", "The lawyers should work this out. Depending on where you live this would be joint property? You should split the value or one of you can buy the other out. If I were him I\u2019d bring it up with the lawyer.", "Or maybe since she doesn't care about them, have them appraised and let him buy them for 50% off. Make a little change out of it. Or use them as a bargaining tool during the divorce, rings in exchange for half the beamer maybe. Preferably the half with the steering wheel.", "If it's an heirloom then they can buy it back for a reasonable price", ">\u201dcan kick rocks with bare feet\u201d\nLol", "Legally, engagement rings are gifts and they belong to the person they are given to, regardless of if you're married or not. Same for wedding rings. (ETA: looks like this might vary by state in the USA.)\n\nSocially, it's generally expected that you give the engagement ring back if you break the engagement. But you keep the rings if you're married. \n\nThe reasoning for that isn't really because of a contract. Engagement and wedding rings in a marriage (and other jewelry) were often the only things the women really owned. If you needed to leave your husband, you could sell your rings for money. If you're engaged, your father should still be financially providing for you, so no need for what was essentially a jewelry savings account. \n\nThat's also why engagement rings are supposed to be 3 months' salary, btw. Give women enough money to go somewhere safe when they sell and get set up.", "By your same logic with the engagement contract, I would think OPs husband\u2019s logic on her not fulfilling the marriage contract (til death do if part) would apply similarly?", "This is not r/amitechnicallylegallycorrect, it\u2018s r/aita. What does being petty and digging your heels in if you don\u2018t care about the rings accomplish except increasing tensions with her ex and probably making life harder for their shared child?\n\n\nESH, ex hsuband shouldn\u2018t go on weird power trips and OP shouldn\u2018t be escalating the situation for something she allegedly doesn\u2018t care about. Both should think about their child and do better", "They\u2019re marital assets.", "That\u2019s not true. It depends on the state. In some states, you are required to give the rings back, or you can have it taken out of your part of the settlement. OP needs to check local laws prior to doing anything.", "You can have the legal right to do something and still be an AH for doing it.", "That is something a lot of people on reddit don't seem to understand. When you get a divorce and there is a kid involved you're stuck dealing with your ex at minimum until the kid turns 18. Is it really worth making a stink about something when it only contributes to a more toxic environment for the kid.", "The only thing I\u2019ve heard of is throwing the ring(s) back in their face if to make a point, never heard of demanding them back either", "Engagement rings are stipulatory. She married him. She fulfilled the stipulation of the engagement ring. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t keep something I don\u2019t plan on selling. But that\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t waste energy on people that don\u2019t matter anymore.", "I chose to leave for a few reasons, but one of the biggest (and I think most applicable in this situation) was his refusal to meaningfully participate in marriage counseling to repair our relationship. I tried for years to \u201cfix\u201d our marriage, and he wouldn\u2019t meet me halfway. Eventually I gave up.", "Marital assets???\n\nCan you back this up or are you pulling this out of your a.....  Hat?", "This is not the case in every state, nor is it the case if OPs ex can afford a decent attorney and the ring is actually worth something.", "If it's a family heirloom, she can return it. To a different family member. I would recommend the matriarch figure.", "This is what I did. There were a couple sticking points but they all came out to about 2k, so I used the ring to get that 2k, and then sent the family heirloom back. \n\nHe used it with his next wife 16 months later so I guess he needed it.", "Nothing about that is accurate except for the part where they\u2019re gifts. At all. \n\nRings didn\u2019t become \u201c3 months of salary\u201d until a particularly effective marketing campaign by De Beers diamond company in the 1930\u2019s. It has nothing to do giving anyone an out so they could sell it. There is no tradition there.", "Mate this is completely wrong in the state of California. Look up Cali civil code 1590. Super clear.", "Except keeping a ring isn\u2019t contingent on staying married \u201ctil death do us part\u201d. Do people still say this in their vows? Genuinely curious. Because wedding rings are anticipated gifts to the bride and groom. It becomes their individual property once married. Engagement rings are contractual gifts. A promise or rather intent to marry. Once married. The promise is fulfilled. The gift is now mine free and clear. Heirlooms being the only exception, possibly. Depends on the circumstances. \n\nOf course there are circumstances where I (me, personally) would give the ring back but she doesn\u2019t have to because it\u2019s hers.", "There's nothing about death in the contract.", "If she keeps giving in to every single power trip he comes up with though, he's going to think he can continue to walk all over her whenever he wants to.", "If anyone is (potentially) making life harder for their child, it\u2019s the husband. For demanding what\u2019s not his to take. Especially since she mentioned things with him were difficult to begin with in dealing with the divorce. I would not roll over and give in to him. He can calm his tits and move on. This is on him NOT her.", "Ignore him for now on the subject.  Hang onto the rings and he can make the request through his lawyer in court and let the courts decide. \n\nThis is probably another one of his little power plays. If he waxes and wanes between being corporative and then trying to mess with you again, it might be best to have all communication go through a lawyer from here on out. You don't need this kind of stress while trying to unwind your marriage and restart your life.", "I don't know, I'm not a lawyer.", "Because she... thinks the items gifted to her were gifts?", "I'm not a lawyer, but it just seemed to make sense that any large purchases made during a marriage would be considered marital assets.\n\nDid a bit of Googling, and apparently this is highly specific to where you are and includes a lot of nuance. For instance, in my state, there's apparently a specific carve-out for engagement and wedding rings; they're considered gifts and are kept by the respective spouses.", "> If they called off the engagement in most states she\u2019d have to return that but once the promise of marriage has been fulfilled it\u2019s hers\n\nVaries by jurisdiction. Some US states treat them as conditional gifts, some treat them as gifts.\n\n> Engagement ring is hers once they are married!\n\nAFAIK this is generally true, although I'm sure there are exceptions *somewhere*. Family law varies quite a bit.", "I think it depends on how the marriage ended  if I'd just give it back", "Please tell me you sent her a photo of you wearing \"her rings\". I would be pissed if I found out my partner \"reused\" our bridal set from his previous marriage.", "Where in my comment did I say she should give into every single power trip?", "As I already said, is it worth it to escalate the situation for something she doesn\u2018t care about?", "Great compromise!", "Because she doesn't want them and is keeping them to spite him.  After initiating the divorce.", "In Texas the engagement ring is the promise/contract and once fulfilled becomes the wife\u2019s sole property. You would need a prenup to get it back! Engagement and wedding rings are so touchy there are special laws governing these assets it\u2019s actually quite interesting!", "Even conditional gifts in that the condition is made once married and then it becomes a gift in most places, which is sole property After that it\u2019s all bananas! Will also include that if given for a holiday (birthday, valentine, Christmas, anniversary etc) the engagement ring may not have to be given back if the engagement is broken as it\u2019s considered solely a gift without a promise attached. \n\nI\u2019m in Texas and my ex\u2019s lawyer brother walked us through the ins and outs when he was about to propose to his lawyer girlfriend", "so youd stoop to his level..classic", "I have no contact with him (just heard about it from friends) and I feel so bad for her as it is, that she has to marry that miserable human being, I figure she can live without that knowledge. (I mean I also heard from the internet about his arrest for domestic violence, so\u2026 yeah.)", "Except she\u2019s NOT escalating. He is.", "Talk to your lawyer first. Just in case it would reflect negatively on you in court. It might be best to hang onto the rings until the divorce is settled. He can make a request through his lawyer and the courts if he wants it back. Let the judge decide. That way you ate covered and he can't twist this around and use it against you. Once you sell the rings you can't go back.", "Well, it\u2019s still a bit petty, to be honest, but the ex can\u2019t fuss about it too much without coming across as way more petty.", "Why does he want the ring?\n\nIt is her ring. Just because she no longer has an emotional connection to the ring doesn't mean that he has any right to it.", "Yea it makes perfect sense why they would have special laws as they aren't just a thing. They are a representation of love and emotion and their ownership status can very easily be volatile since divorce brings its own extremely powerful emotion.", "\ud83d\ude32 I hope you dodged that side of him", "What would you call \u201edigging in your heels\u201c then?", "Ya they come with their own separate contract - but post marriage it is most often and most likely, her sole property not marital property. I liked the idea of selling it and putting money into the sons college fund someone else suggested", "Probably not.", "Keeping what\u2019s hers \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Unfortunately you're probably right but one can always hope", "So you think she should fight the ex husband over something trivial and make life worse for the kid? Because this will make things worse. And personally I believe that her responsibility for the child outweighs petty arguments like this", "True \ud83d\udc4d", "I don\u2019t think she should DO anything. She\u2019s not fighting. The ex is fighting. She\u2019s not making life worse for the kid. That remains to be seen. But if so, it\u2019s on the ex not her.", "Lol dude you\u2018re just denying reality at this point. If the ex wants the rings back and she refuses it will obviously lead to a fight. Who caused it doesn\u2018t really matter, if it\u2018s about something OP does not care about she should think of her child first and just give him the goddamn rings."]}
