He doesn't get to just demand these things back unless they're family heirlooms. (They're not, right? Because that would definitely make Y T A.) And you don't get to just arbitrarily keep them either. These are marital assets (along with *his* wedding ring, mind you), that need to be part of the equitable division of assets.", "NTA - if you called off the wedding and never married him I would say you should give it back, but you did marry him so they are yours to do what you want.", "Nah girl that\u2019s your diamond. Keep it", "There are times where legally you\u2019re in the right, but you might still be wrong. Think about why you\u2019re doing this - because you care about the rings? or because you are being a bit resentful in the whole situation (rightly or wrongly, doesn\u2019t matter)? if it\u2019s the latter, YTA just because it\u2019s a stupid hill to die on if it doesn\u2019t actually matter to you. But, if you do care about the rings in whatever regard, NTA.", "yta. he cares more about the engagement rings. if you just dont give two falafels about those rings, why pinch his nerves", "INFO: If he had asked politely without demanding that you comply, what would you have said?", "NTA - you\u2019re right, he gave it to you so it is yours. You could return it if you want to but not doing so doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "Just give it to him, he\u2019s probably keeping some hope in his heart that you\u2019re holding on to it because you want to reconcile.\n\nYou don\u2019t care for it anyway, that makes YTA.", "YTA x 100 - Divorce happens, but he's right that you should give the ring back since you decided to end the marriage.  You're even more of an A for not wanting but keeping it just to annoy him.  I'm happy for him that he is no longer married to you", "NTA. \n\nRings, like any other gift, are given to the recipient to do what they want with it. One doesn't get to give a gift and ask for it back, otherwise it was just a loaner. \n\nHe's upset. Hopefully he'll get over it. If not, it's still his problem and not yours.\n\nI personally would sell it. Wouldn't want that bad juju in my house.", "[deleted]", "I have never heard of returning rings once you get a divorce. I thought once the rings were given, they being to the bride and then became a gift. I was not aware they are \u201cloaner\u201d rings.", "YTA. You asked for the divorce. He\u2019s having a hard time, he\u2019s clearly upset. They don\u2019t mean anything to you, just give them back. In my head, if the man asks for the divorce, then you are a little more justified to keep the rings, but if the woman asks for the divorce, she should give them back as it wasn\u2019t his decision.", "I\u2019d let this be something negotiated with lawyers.

Will it help ease the tension between the two of you for your kids sake?", "I don't know about the law at all so won't comment on that.\n\nYTA, if you don't care about the ring I think you should just give it back. Otherwise you're just on a power trip too? By withholding a ring you have no use for at all. \n\nIf you wanted the ring for literally any reason I'd give a different answer but you don't", "NTA.", "YTA. He gave you the rings with the intention you would remain married. You\u2019re the one leaving him. If you don\u2019t want to hand them down then why not return them out of civility?", "NTA. It is yours and not given on the pretense of \u201conly if this works out\u201d", "NTA, and by law, you are in the right.  The rings were a gift, and now they're yours.

If you broke up during engagement I think it would be assholish not to return the engagement ring - but you got married, so that's done and dusted.  Never heard of someone returning a wedding ring.", "NTA\n\n  \nKeep the rings.", "If you don\u2019t care so much about the rings then why create a point of contention over it. He\u2019s clearly hurt and trying to hurt you back. Give him the rings back. It will end his attempt at manipulating you, make him look childish. Fighting over something you don\u2019t care about will only delay the divorce and make your co parenting relationship more hostile in the future. Your children deserve better. NTA by the way", "So, you don\u2019t care about the rings. You don\u2019t want the rings. You\u2019re not going to pass them on. You\u2019re not going to sell them. I guess your soon to be ex is not the only one that goes on power trips. You said the divorce is 80% smooth and 20% rough. Well, seems to me you can make it 95% smooth if you want. YTA.", "So, just logically speaking, if the ring was specific to engagement and marriage - and you\u2019ve now exited that arrangement, of your own free will - you will owe the ring back. That\u2019s bullshit trying to say \u201cI don\u2019t want this arrangement, but I\u2019m gonna keep the ring because it\u2019s valuable or I\u2019ve attached some meaning to it\u201d\n\nYTA", "NTA; keep them, and trade them in for a piece of  jewelry you love when it\u2019s all over and done with to celebrate yourself.", "NTA. Keep the rings. They ARE yours. I think the only case in which you would be required to return the rings is if you were engaged and the engagement broke off before marriage. In engagement, the ring is given with the expectation of entering a marriage contract. No marriage contract, return the ring. However, that doesn\u2019t apply to your situation. You entered your marriage contract. So the rings are yours. The only exception to this I would say is probably a family heirloom with expectation that it would be passed down. If divorce, return family heirloom ring. In this case, I don\u2019t think returning the ring is required, but I would feel shitty keeping it from the family it came from. Sooooo unless that ring is a family heirloom, stb ex-husband can kick rocks with bare feet.", "So, you get to keep the engagement ring since you married him. You each keep your own bands.   \n\n\nNTA", "When I got divorced, I mailed my ring back to my former MIL.  The diamonds came from her first engagement ring from my ex's father.  I wasn't going to wear it again and did not want to keep anything that would give my ex a hold over me.  Sure enough, several months afterwards, he contacted me demanding the ring back.  I told him to talk to his mom.  \n\nNTA, but sometimes it's better to let go and disengage from the drama for your own sake.", "YTA", "NTA. He gave you the ring, and it's yours now. His reasoning doesn't change that. Stand your ground.", "Keep the rings. They were for a marriage that no longer exists. That marriage was yours as much as his, and the rings are yours.\n\nNTA", "Sorry OPs Soon to Be Ex but that\u2019s not how things work. You are NTA to keep the items that were given to you!", "NTA. Once you are married the agreement is fulfilled and the rings belong to whoever wears them.", "NTA.\n\nUnless they are family heirlooms, they were gifts, given in earnest.", "YTA. Engagement and wedding rings are not gifts. They are a symbolic acceptance of a covenant you agreed to, which is now broken. If your husband gave you an emerald necklace to wear as a wedding gift to his bride that would be a circumstance you because it was a gift. If your divorce is 80% amicable and you have already said you won\u2019t give the jewelry to your child, be the bigger person and return the jewelry.", "YTA.  Sorry for this but you said it doesn't mean anything to you and you don't care about the money so you would really only be holding on to it out of spite.  Just avoid the drama, let him have his rings and maybe you can push it to a 90-10 split.  Good luck", "Yta, sounds like he\u2019s watched judge Judy, he\u2019s  technically right.", "NTA, but is it worth it?\n\nYou are definitely entitled to the rings, legally and otherwise. If he's going to claim you didn't fulfill the promise, I'm guessing he didn't uphold his vows either. But regardless, is this going to drag out the divorce? Or will it set some kind of precedent so he'll try to take more things that he's not entitled to?", "This is a great question, and honestly I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d like to say yes, but there\u2019s also so much bad blood around this kind of thing with him (the \u201cI bought it so it\u2019s mine\u201d type of issue was common in our marriage) so I don\u2019t know that I would no matter how politely he had asked, unless he had a compelling reason as to why he wanted it.", "I appreciate this perspective. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not engaging in a back and forth with him. He asked, I said no, he continued texted, I told him I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it further with him. Also I\u2019m not withholding the ring just because I want to upset him. It\u2019s more to do with his historical behavior and not wanting to let him have the power to demand things from me and me just caving when he doesn\u2019t actually have a right to that thing from me. \n\nAll that said, I still think it\u2019s on the petty side and I understand, respect, and appreciate your YTA judgement.", ">He sounds like a big baby\n\nShe doesn't want the ring except to annoy him.  She's the big baby", ">It sounds like he just wants to sell it & keep the money for it himself.\n\nDoes it?", "Engagement ring is hers once they are married! If they called off the engagement in most states she\u2019d have to return that but once the promise of marriage has been fulfilled it\u2019s hers", "I think most states don\u2019t count it as marital asset as it was given prior to the marriage. It\u2019s considered a gift", "In some states, an engagement ring is like a verbal contract. \n\nIf they break up, there's no more engagement. Rings go back.\n\nEdit: I'm dumb. They did get married.  NTA", "This is not true. They are consideration in a marriage contract. Once the marriage happens, the rings are yours.", "She doesn't sound like someone worth celebrating", "Ugh, that really sucks.\n\nSo\u2026normally, I\u2019d say NTA, keep the rings, and good riddance to the ex. But there is a kid involved and you\u2019re going to be stuck coparenting with him, so (as you already know) things are more complicated. What I\u2019m going to say is still NTA but move cautiously. Personally, I\u2019d sell the rings to a reputable jeweler and set up a college fund (that he can\u2019t access) for your kid with the proceeds. That will make it really tricky for him to paint you as The Evil Greedy Ex, since the funds are for the benefit of your shared kid.", "NTA. Legally, they are yours. Psychologically, they are yours and even discussing this with your ex reinforces his sense of entitlement to make demands of you regardless if they are valid. You said no and that you'd not discuss it further and that's enough attention to the little guy.", "Admittedly I Googled it and there were a few answers. They were pretty varied but I went with the one that seemed the most well reasoned. The answers I saw spread from it being the wife's for the reason you outlined to it was the husband's because it was a \"conditional\" gift. That didn't make much sense to me. But the one about it being marital property actually made some sense. I think the engagement ring is almost certainly considered the other person's property. But the wedding ring is given at the wedding and it made sense to me that it would belong to \"both\".", "What states? I know back in the days engagements were considered contracts to marry but not anymore. I\u2019ve never heard of a state/judge stating this in present day. All the cases I read in my family law class back in law school said the opposite. The engagement rings were considered gifts and the did not need to be returned to the other spouse", "Great response!", "Okay I had my own response typed out, (I was focused on the fact that she didn't want the ring and wasn't even going to sell it) but this is a great idea. If OP goes with this option it eliminates any pettiness on her part. This is the answer.", "This is a fantastic idea that I hadn\u2019t thought of. Thank you.", "California for one. Engagement ring is a conditional gift. Condition is marriage. But my original comment doesn't matter. They were married.", "Good luck!", "Ah okay, yeah."]}
