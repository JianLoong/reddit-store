I was fine with that. I would support and encourage her if that's what she wanted. The past 2 weeks she has been looking down on the rest of the family with snooty comments like \"you know that will just sit in your colon right?\" And \"It doesn't make you THE murderer, but it def makes you the accomplice.\" Her brother(7) is getting sick of it and so am I. Especially when I just get home from work and I just want to relax and enjoy my meal.\n\n\n3 days ago was my sons birthday and we decided to take him out to his favorite restaurant. This place had vegetarian options so I was not worried about my daughter being upset about that. I asked her if she wanted to go and she excitedly said yes. We get there and when the waiter takes out order, my daughter decided she wanted a mushroom burger. I said \"Woah, I thought you wanted to go vegetarian?\"\nShe says \"I'm taking a break since its a special occasion.\" I told the waiter to cancel that order and give us a few minutes. \n\nI looked at her and said \"Look here missy, you have been nothing but a jerk these last few days with your passive-aggressive commments since going vegan,  vegetarian, whatever! You either commit to it now or you get nothing at all.\" She doesn't even look at me, she just flops her head on the table and starts crying the moment I start talking. My husband does nothing but says \"way to go\". She doesn't move her head the entire dinner even when I ask if we need to talk outside? Go the the bathroom to collect herself? Nothing. We get home and she just goes to her room. My husband thinks im the AH because I had to ruin a night out.\n\nAITAH?\n\nEdit for clarification: So my husband and I told her to knock it off with the comments before this happened. At first, it was random cons about eating meat. I told her I'm aware but this is my choice. \n\nThen came the rude remarks like \"So you're just gonna take 2 years off your lifespan like that?\" When I chose to reheat meatloaf for dinner instead of a pizza. At that point, I told her that she does not get make rude remarks about people's lifestyle choices like that and if she says something rude like that again, im taking away her phone. Of course she cried and ran to her room. \n\nShe stopped saying things to me and her dad, but then she would start picking on her brother when we were out of ear-shot and would deny it when he would tell us. Apparently she has being telling her brother that he's a loser for eating meat (hotdogs) and so are his friends. After doing this twice I took her phone away and told her to apologize to her brother and if she wants to educate people on vegetarianism, thats fine, but she needs to stop being a bully about it. Again, she breaks down and just runs to her room. I'm not even yelling at her, this is how she tries to deflect accountability. \n\nI tried to talk to her an hour later about it, but she flailed onto her bed and started bawling. I told her she needed to calm down and have a conversation with me about what's going on. She just screamed \"NOOOO\" so I left before I lost my cool. At this point, I am really considering therapy for us.", "created_utc": 1692360809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uiwe7/aitah_for_making_my_daughter_cry_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 1542, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You put down consequences for her rudeness at the time, not let it all build up and come to a head when she changes her mind.

Well done Mom, she will never forget this. What should you have done instead?  Well for starters: when she started on the condescension (wonder where she learned that?!)  you should have told her,  we don't comment on other peoples food,  ever,  no matter what. Her opinions regarding what other people put in their mouths is not needed and it won't be tolerated, forcing your beliefs on other people is unreasonable.  Second when she ordered a burger you should have let her have it, and later on,  you could have asked what was with the change of choice and had a discussion that she can choose to eat different types of food without going full veggie to keep hsr options open. And thirdly : what did you gain from shaming her in a restaurant at a Birthday dinner? And refusing her food because ahe acted like a 12 year old.  You just used food as a weapon against your 12 year old daughter. You acted completely unreasonably.  You have proven you don't know how to speak to your children and you will fly off the handle at any mistake they make.", "YTA. What a disgusting comment OP and completely the wrong place and time to even consider addressing her rudeness in such a harsh manner. Did she eat anything at all?", "YTA\n\nThere is a time and a place for such peptalks, and it is NOT at a special birthday dinner.

I don\u2019t blame her for not being good at communication, it\u2019s obvious that you aren\u2019t good at it either. Kids only model what they learn from the parent.", "YTA. She's 12. A lot of kids go through attempting to not eat meat because they are sad for animals.  Its not an easy transition, especially for a kid.

Your daughter had buyer\u2019s remorse on being vegetarian and was looking for an excuse to drop it.

I thought it was a lot, but it might depend on prevalence of vegies in the area) of places it's called a mushroom burger, and it's a beef burger that has mushrooms as a topping.\n\nA \"Portobello Mushroom Burger\" would be the giant mushroom in lieu of the beef patty.", ">Mushroom burgers don\u2019t have beef usually. That\u2019s the entire point is it is made using mushrooms and not with beef.\n\nThat's definitely a regional thing - around here, it's just as likely to be a beef patty with sauteed mushrooms on it.", "Yup. I think this entire \u201ccan no longer digest meat after being vegetarian\u201d phenomenon is somewhere between overblown and pure fiction.

It was setting an expectation and holding her daughter to it. Her daughter, like many teens and tweens, decided to make this her hill to die on, and OP called her bluff. \n\nIt sounds like OP's daughter has already made quite a few other meals difficult and unpleasant, so this isn't a new issue but a continuation. And all part of the natural separation between a child and parent.", "Then her willfully misinterpreting a consequence is something else she's going to have to straighten our as well. \n\nA good parent doesn't let a child act however they want with no consequences. OP is being a really good parent.

OP just let her know where one is.", "Public embarrassment is actually one of the ONLY ways people learn consequences. Not to mention she chose to embarrass herself - I didn't see in the post how OP stood on the table and asked everyone in the restaurant to watch as her daughter threw a tantrum. \n\nShe's 12. Everything is embarrassing and the end of the world and mixed up and confusing. But throwing a tantrum at 12 in a restaurant is not the way to get people on her side.", "I don't see how saying \"give us a minute\" to the waiter is public embarrassment. People need extra time before they order, no matter where you go.", "Okay. You convinced me.

But it takes longer than 2 weeks.", "I get that All. The. Time. Without fail.

Her daughter wasn't chastising anyone for eating meat. It might have been better than other dinners because she was joining in, and disincentivized to judge others.\n\nOP didn't need to call a bluff at the table, in that way. It was punitive, didn't correct the rudeness, and made things unpleasant for the person who they were there to celebrate. There were other ways to handle it.", "No, OP is not being a really good parent here. OP gave a consequence that cratered any opportunity for growth and learning.

As for public embarrassment, it's horrendous to me that you think this is a good way to raise children. Yes, everything is embarrassing because kids are just learning to navigate the world. Making it worse is a great way to mess up a child's mental health.", "While in public, the mother basically told her daughter that she's a fake and had assumed an identity she had no right to.", "I\u2019m not saying to give into the whims.

And every parent fucks up at some point but this was outright humiluating yhe kid. \n\nBoth are wrong here but both deserve some grace.", "It was absolutely already confrontational, because it was not a dinner that existed in a vacuum. There was already a simmering undercurrent of issues around food because of how OP's daughter was behaving, and her daughter's flippant attitude around \"Rules are for thee, not for me\" when she decided that anyone else who ate meat was evil but she was fine was the straw that broke the camel's back. \n\nI have no expectation of parents to be perfect, because that's not actually possible. OP probably could have chosen better language in that moment, but quite frankly everything that was already brought into that confrontation was already there, and no matter what OP said it wouldn't have gone well.", "How did she shame her kid? The mom reinforced what she's been telling her daughter this whole time - don't be an asshole about other people's dietary choices just to turn back on yours at your convenience. Most parents wouldn't even be so accommodative to provide different meal options for their kids if they wanted to explore new diets (for example, in my family, we just had to eat whatever was on the table). So not only is this daughter throwing this kind of privilege of independence in her family's face, but she's also being a hypocrite about her so-called \"values\". She's free to explore and go back and forth between her choices... BUT she's not allowed to be a dick to people who don't share her values.
