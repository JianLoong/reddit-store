I was fine with that. I would support and encourage her if that's what she wanted. The past 2 weeks she has been looking down on the rest of the family with snooty comments like \"you know that will just sit in your colon right?\" And \"It doesn't make you THE murderer, but it def makes you the accomplice.\" Her brother(7) is getting sick of it and so am I. Especially when I just get home from work and I just want to relax and enjoy my meal.\n\n\n3 days ago was my sons birthday and we decided to take him out to his favorite restaurant. This place had vegetarian options so I was not worried about my daughter being upset about that. I asked her if she wanted to go and she excitedly said yes. We get there and when the waiter takes out order, my daughter decided she wanted a mushroom burger. I said \"Woah, I thought you wanted to go vegetarian?\"\nShe says \"I'm taking a break since its a special occasion.\" I told the waiter to cancel that order and give us a few minutes. \n\nI looked at her and said \"Look here missy, you have been nothing but a jerk these last few days with your passive-aggressive commments since going vegan,  vegetarian, whatever! You either commit to it now or you get nothing at all.\" She doesn't even look at me, she just flops her head on the table and starts crying the moment I start talking. My husband does nothing but says \"way to go\". She doesn't move her head the entire dinner even when I ask if we need to talk outside? Go the the bathroom to collect herself? Nothing. We get home and she just goes to her room. My husband thinks im the AH because I had to ruin a night out.\n\nAITAH?\n\n2nd Edit: When I said Mushroom Burger, I mean a hamburger with sauteed mushrooms on top with melted cheese. It's definitely not a portobello patty.\n\nEdit for clarification: So my husband and I told her to knock it off with the comments before this happened. At first, it was random cons about eating meat. I told her I'm aware but this is my choice. \n\nThen came the rude remarks like \"So you're just gonna take 2 years off your lifespan like that?\" When I chose to reheat meatloaf for dinner instead of a pizza. At that point, I told her that she does not get make rude remarks about people's lifestyle choices like that and if she says something rude like that again, im taking away her phone. Of course she cried and ran to her room. \n\nShe stopped saying things to me and her dad, but then she would start picking on her brother when we were out of ear-shot and would deny it when he would tell us. Apparently she has being telling her brother that he's a loser for eating meat (hotdogs) and so are his friends. After doing this twice I took her phone away and told her to apologize to her brother and if she wants to educate people on vegetarianism, thats fine, but she needs to stop being a bully about it. Again, she breaks down and just runs to her room. I'm not even yelling at her, this is how she tries to deflect accountability. \n\nI tried to talk to her an hour later about it, but she flailed onto her bed and started bawling. I told her she needed to calm down and have a conversation with me about what's going on. She just screamed \"NOOOO\" so I left before I lost my cool. At this point, I am really considering therapy for us.", "created_utc": 1692360809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uiwe7/aitah_for_making_my_daughter_cry_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 11494, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well done Mom, she will never forget this. What should you have done instead?  Well for starters: when she started on the condescension (wonder where she learned that?!)  you should have told her,  we don't comment on other peoples food,  ever,  no matter what. Her opinions regarding what other people put in their mouths is not needed and it won't be tolerated, forcing your beliefs on other people is unreasonable.  Second when she ordered a burger you should have let her have it, and later on,  you could have asked what was with the change of choice and had a discussion that she can choose to eat different types of food without going full veggie to keep hsr options open. And thirdly : what did you gain from shaming her in a restaurant at a Birthday dinner? And refusing her food because ahe acted like a 12 year old.  You just used food as a weapon against your 12 year old daughter. You acted completely unreasonably.  You have proven you don't know how to speak to your children and you will fly off the handle at any mistake they make.", "YTA. What a disgusting comment OP and completely the wrong place and time to even consider addressing her rudeness in such a harsh manner. Did she eat anything at all?", "YTA\n\nThere is a time and a place for such peptalks, and it is NOT at a special birthday dinner.

A lot of kids go through attempting to not eat meat because they are sad for animals.  Its not an easy transition, especially for a kid.

But at the same time, they teased me about my weight and would make comments like \u201cyou\u2019re ballooning up\u201d.

I often starved myself because \u201cope there\u2019s nothing vegetarian, I\u2019ll have an apple\u201d. This was literally the only way to get my parents to purchase healthy fruits and vegetables.

It could be a control thing for her, the bullying could be a way to mask insecurities, and the sudden change in what she wanted to order at the restaurant could be an indicator that she\u2019s incredibly hungry. I will say, the cravings for red meat are strong when you\u2019re not eating correctly.

It made lots of family gatherings awkward and made family dinners short, but I refused to allow her to make a scene. \n\nIf I didn't take her away, she would bawl in front of everyone or kick the table (or someone else if she was really upset) until she was removed. I missed many announcements of my cousins and other siblings because of her attitude. \n\nI get gentle parenting, but now is the time to tell her about how her actions will continue to put her in these situations where she gets punishment.

Addressing the behavior without understanding the reasoning is just addressing the symptoms. \n\nGive yourself a little forgiveness. You\u2019re NTA even if you make a mistake. Own up to it and be curious.", "YTA. It\u2019s apparent where your 12 year old child learned her social skit.", "YTA. \n\n1)  She\u2019s 12. That\u2019s the time when kids explore different paths. Shaming someone, anyone, for how they walk that path is mean. Demanding they stay on it when they aren\u2019t sure it\u2019s right for them is cruel. That turns being around your family, which should be the safest place to explore who you are as a person, into an unsafe place. A place where trying new things and \u201cfailing\u201d is a punishable offense. \n\n2) Any kind of food shame geared towards young people, especially 12-year-old girls, is a massive misstep. Your daughter is at a junction point in her life when being a kid is over and being a teenage girl starts. That\u2019s when girls' bodies are \u201csupposed\u201d to begin looking certain ways. That pressure is enormous!  The negative comments you mention her making are all around the health of a vegetarian lifestyle. Why does a 12-year-old care about the health of a meal? Why is she restricting her food if she clearly wants to eat it? Her severe reactions to you forcing her to choose a lifestyle path is telling that something bigger is going on.  I doubt she will want to share what that is with you now since you\u2019ve just made yourself an unsafe person for this subject matter. \n\n3) The negative comments she made are a teachable moments. It\u2019s when you ask why she feels the need to put down other people's lifestyles. Telling her she\u2019s a jerk doesn\u2019t explain why what she said is a bad thing. When you put down people's lifestyles, you\u2019re not only shaming their activities but them as a person. It\u2019s hurtful, and 90% of people don\u2019t want to be hurtful to the people they love. Who\u2019s setting this example to shame others for their lifestyle choices\u2026This is one of those check-the-mirror moments. \n\nDon\u2019t die on this hill. You didn\u2019t mean to hurt her feeling so profoundly. You weren\u2019t aware that there is (mostly likely) something bigger going on behind them. Talk it out and apologize for embarrassing her and shaming her food choices, especially in such a public place. Apologize to your son for embarrassing his sister at his birthday dinner and taking the spotlight off him on his special day. Take the family on a redo birthday dinner at a burger restaurant. Start the meal by telling them they should order ANYTHING they want off the menu. Good luck, and I hope this isn\u2019t one of those stick-with-you-childhood memories for your kids, but if so, I hope it\u2019s one that shows the power of an apology and not one of shame and embarrassment that can come with trying new things.", "YTA - There is no say  \"Look here missy\",\"whatever\" or \"you need to calm down\" without being an AH.

The fact that she decided she wanted a burger does not mean being a vegan is not an appropriate choice for her, especially with her being only 12 and prone to falling off the wagon.

Why should she not be held accountable when she was knowingly defiant? She's not 4 years old, she's 12 and has certainly been taught that children need to listen to their parents. Idk that I necessarily agree with what OP did, but whether or not I do, if my child had a meltdown in the restaurant after that they're definitely going to the car.

Talk to the kid's parents. \n\nThere was a million better ways to deal with this than to try to force her to STAY VEGAN during a CELEBRATION. Maybe she really was needing the nutrition from the meat.

The issue is being a jerk about it. And forbidding her to eat at all as punishment? Not cool.", "I'm going to go with YTA because your daughter is an insufferable TWELVE YEAR OLD and you are the adult. She's a child with a partially developed brain whose mood swings and black and white thinking are informed by puberty.

It's a phase she will grow out of and this will happen sooner rather than later if you react wisely.\n\nInstead, it seems like you relished the opportunity to say 'gotcha' when she wanted to order meat. You weren't intervening with regard to her bratty behaviour, you were sinking to her pre-teen level. She shamed you over food so you wanted the satisfaction of doing it right back. \n\nThis could have been an opportunity for you to dialogue with her. Next time she got mad at her brother for eating meat, you could have said 'look, we didn't say anything when you ordered a mushroom burger, so I want you to extend that same grace to your brother when he eats meat.'", "Yep. YTA. Its totally normal for kids to make decisions based on unrealistic black and white viewpoints that *other* people who don\u2019t choose like them. It\u2019s a very tribal, cliquish way of seeing the world. A lot of parenting, at least when you\u2019re not focused on just dropping the hammer on them, is showing them how to live in a world that\u2019s not so adversarial. \n\nYou also missed a great opportunity to talk with her later about how being a vegetarian has clearly been hard for her and because she\u2019s been so judgmental with the rest of her family she\u2019s had to deal with all that hardship on her own, by alienating others, and subsequently herself. \n\nLuckily, you get a do over as a parent. You should consider offering that same option to your kids.", "YTA.

Seems like you\u2019ve been dying for the opportunity to one-up your daughter on a pathetic moral highground instead of having conversations with her privately about how she speaks to you/your son.\n\nHer attempt to demean you/your family isn\u2019t surprising behavior given the fact that you chose the occasion of your son\u2019s birthday dinner to publicly berate her.

She is also a kid who is acting inappropriately through her comments, but that does not make a 12 year-old an asshole. That's also normal and she needs guidance from mature parents.

Yes, that happens and it's been demonstrated.\n\nAnyway, she's 12, but on being called out, both at home and in public, she's reacting as if she were barely 5, so I completely agree with you on seeking therapy not just for her, but for the parents as well. Clearly something in the communication is wrong and since communication is always a two-sided deal, the parents need therapy as well.", "This may be true, however publicly humiliating one's child to prove a point only demonstrates to the child that their own mother is not a reliable person to come to when working through difficult life decisions.   \n\n\nMaybe OP is okay with being that kind of parent, but then they ought to admit that to themselves and figure out why they became a parent in the first place.", "A couple things\n\n>You didn't make her cry.

She might,\n\nOp definitely need to learn how to communicate with her daughter because starving a child is not the way to parent\n\n>When she acts like a toddler and cries to get her way, don't give her a reaction, just nonchalantly say you're not engaging in that and you'll talk to her when she capable of it and leave the room\n\nYoure talking about an emotional child that clearly has not learned healthy communication from either parents, and your logic is that can only be fixed by ignoring said child. \n\n\n>She ruined his birthday and still thinks she's the victim.\n\nAll the daughter did was order a burger, she was behaving until op decided this was going to be a petty \"lesson\" that basically just shames the child. \n\nMy guess is you're either a victim of motherly abuse yourself or you're a mother validating your own shitty practices. \n\nEvery issue with a child is a parent-child issue, because parents are the ones responsible in instilling healthy behavior in their children, and dealing with the outcomes when they realize they didn't teach them enough.", "OP has tried repeatedly to deal with it according to her edits.

I think that calling her a jerk is more truth-telling than name calling.", "As an American, my eyes are rolling too.", "Have you been around a 12 year old? They are deeply emotional, and bursting into tears after being publicly humiliated by anyone (let alone your own parent) sounds like a natural reaction from a pre-teen. The mum sounds like a bully, so it isn't hard to see where the daughter gets that from.", "People keep saying she's bullying, but really she was just repeating what she's learned (right or wrong) in a passionate, 12 year old way. My niece went through it when she was 13. She went into a speech about how salmon have their skin ripped off when they're still alive. I just pointed to my crispy skin salmon and pointed out that it doesn't sound true. She sprouted lots of vegan \"facts\". She eventually went back to eating everything. \nThis child called her brother a loser TWICE. That's it! OP is being dramatic. So is the child, but she is 12!", "Periods are caused by an unhealthy diet? Where do you even begin with that?", "shit i exhausted myself when i was 12. middle school is truly the worst time of life.  not to mention if she's already menstruating sometimes you just crave a big ass burger because you're iron deficient.", "I\u2019m finally glad someone said this. I\u2019ve read too many comments of people calling the parent the AH because they weren\u2019t \u201cgentle\u201d with their daughter, even though the edits clearly show the parent tried to correct the behavior earlier through conversation. Some people on here have no experience with actual parenting and it shows. \n\nI\u2019m all for having discussions with kids about their behavior and finding ways to correct it without severe punishment or public outbursts, but that doesn\u2019t always work. Every kid is different personality wise and with how they respond to discipline and correction. And sometimes, kids need to be called out for their shit in a very public way in order to really learn that their behavior is gross. Otherwise they don\u2019t learn and they will eventually grow up into entitled asshole adults. Also, OP\u2019s daughter is 12. Her brain is developed enough to understand right from wrong. It\u2019s not like OP reacted like this to a child who is too young mentally, either due to age or disability, to understand how their word choices and tone of voice affect others. \n\nAnd someone here said the daughter wasn\u2019t bullying the brother because it was just normal sibling behavior\u2026 yeah, that\u2019s still bullying. And I\u2019m speaking from experience here. My siblings both have strong personalities and they both went through periods of being absolute terrors in middle school and high school. And both ended up being called out by my parents in restaurants for crappy behavior and many dinners were ruined. Yeah, it sucked but they 100% deserved it and if they hadn\u2019t been called out for their behavior it would\u2019ve only created more sibling resentment. Hell, there\u2019s still a lot of sibling resentment, usually due to one or two of us having to be the \u201cbigger person\u201d while the other one or two were basically being the human equivalent of a toxic dumpster fire in 60mph winds. \n\nI guarantee if the daughter is behaving like this at home, she is probably engaging in bullying behavior at school too and is getting away with it because either the adults there aren\u2019t noticing, they\u2019re noticing and they don\u2019t care, or she is a teachers\u2019 pet and they think she can do no wrong. I had a friend like this as a child. The bullying behaviors started in late elementary school and continued through high school. She kept getting awards for being a \u201ctop student\u201d even though she was cheating off my papers and bullying me when I refused to share them with her. She spread rumors about me at school when I tried to call her out on her behavior. When she got caught in a lie she\u2019d start crying to get sympathy from adults (teachers, principals, etc. she had them all wrapped around her finger). I still have trauma from it and OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s behavior is hitting a little too close to home. \n\nAnd again, I\u2019m going to clarify that I 100% agree that dealing with problem kids at home in a calm way, preferably starting with a discussion before resorting to punishment is the way to go. However, some kids just don\u2019t get it until you embarrass them in public for their crappy behavior. Public embarrassment sucks but it\u2019s also a great teacher, especially when it comes to unacceptable behavior. So yeah, OP- NTA", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f people who are into fake medicine will tell you all kinds of bullshit. \n\nThere are people selling apricot kernel oil as medicine based on the claim that the cyanide compound is a vitamin.

This one is, but luckily someone is at least trying to make her behave decently.", "Wow what an amazing parent you really stuck it out and it sounds like she\u2019s come out the other side so smart and self sufficient in terms of her dietary needs. Also the hydrohomie diet being applied by a child is a-freaking-dorable.", "YTA she\u2019s EXPLORING and experimenting and trying to find out who she is. You know, like 12 yr olds are supposed to do. It\u2019s not ok to limit that or make her choose \u201cone or the other\u201d. You should have waited until after the supper to point out her being hypocritical but again, she\u2019s a child and needs to learn that. Not be shamed in the middle of a restaurant.", "YTA.  Not gonna say ESH when one of the parties is mainly being a 12 year old without adequate parenting. You should have dealt with her misbehavior well before this and absolutely not when you did. The fact that you chose to ruin her brother's birthday outing to fight with a 12 year old tells me that it's not really about your son, although it should have been about both kids--protecting one and not letting the other turn into an asshole with what is not actually abnormal behavior for the newly converted, be they vegetarian or a new non-smoker. Especially a newly converted 12 year old as 12-13 year olds are particularly prone to self righteousness, lack common sense and are often chock full of new hormones. It didn't matter in the slightest if she broke her own dietary rules. It wasn't rude and the whole family was having a good time until you couldn't leave well enough alone. Whatever she may have done or said before, you picked the worst possible time and place to address it and made everything much worse. The family therapy sounds like a good idea because there's more going on here than a 12 year old's vegetarianism.", "Judging by how she reacted at the dinner party, that's probably where the daughter got her attitude from.", "I really don't understand the \"YTA\" responses. \n\nThey're mostly all suggesting that OP can't speak to their child like a human being and that she'll develop an eating disorder as a result.
