Her opinions regarding what other people put in their mouths is not needed and it won't be tolerated, forcing your beliefs on other people is unreasonable.  Second when she ordered a burger you should have let her have it, and later on,  you could have asked what was with the change of choice and had a discussion that she can choose to eat different types of food without going full veggie to keep hsr options open. And thirdly : what did you gain from shaming her in a restaurant at a Birthday dinner? And refusing her food because ahe acted like a 12 year old.
