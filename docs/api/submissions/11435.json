I do not speak Japanese and neither does most of my family. We are hardly even culturally Japanese except for our surname. This will become very relevant later in the story.\n\nI currently study in Canada. Typically when I explain to non-hispanics how the hell an asian person can also be hispanic, they get very confused. The ones that kind of understand think I am a mixed raced, and it does not help that I have a very spanish forename.\n\nI have a group of friends and they set me up with a girl (19f) my two friends (both 20f) have known since childhood. My friends informed me that we both study in the same program just in different universities. There were other things we had in common. On top of this, I did find the girl very attractive physically.\n\nI go out with the girl. I think the title does explain quite well what happened. The girl immediately jumped on my surname and asked me several things about Japanese culture that I could not answer. She seemed to get irritated anytime I\u2019d tell her, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m Peruvian just of Japanese descent,\u201d which was definitely said more than once.\n\nI was also a bit offended that she dismissed my actual culture. As I\u2019m more aligned with Peruvian identity more, I hold more pride in that than in my heritage.\n\nBasically this girl was very obsessed with Japan and would also talk about her ex who \u201clooked Japanese\u201d (he was apparently Vietnamese), and a fair amount of comments that basically confirmed her fetish.\n\nThis is where I may be TA. I am currently eating in a calorie surplus as I struggle a lot with thinness. This means that on our dinner date, I ordered a plate of shrimp risotto for the carbs and proteins. This dish was a whopping $40. And I had seconds which came discounted.\n\nI tell the girl that I felt very bloated and excuse myself to the bathroom. Of course, I simply just left without paying for my own dish.\n\nUpon this decision I did not consider the bill.\n\nMy two friends that introduced me to her called me an AH, however it is not just for ditching her with a $71 bill, but they claim that her fetish is just a preference to asian men.\n\nAnother friend in my group says I was just an AH for leaving her with the bill and that I should have at least left some cash on the chair. I told him if I even remembered, I don\u2019t ever carry cash anyway.\n\nMy last friend tells me I\u2019m not an AH at all and he tells me that I dodged a bullet. He says that since he is black he understands fetishism well.\n\nMy friend group being torn about this has me confused. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to include factors that my friends are torn with. The girl invited me (the one who invites pays).

She obviously ordered cheap if her food only came up to around $21 and leaving her with $50 extra to pay was cruel and could have had a massive financial impact. You should have told her her behaviour was inappropriate and fetishising, paid your bill and left. Even if her behaviour was obviously inappropriate to you it wasn't to her and telling her why you're leaving is the right thing to do and would hopefully have made her realise her behaviour wasn't ok. Failing that you still wouldn't have been the asshole if you'd paid your share and left without telling her. But you didn't let her know or pay for your own you just left her with a giant bill.

Maybe she's just stupid in how she communicates, that happens often with younger people when they like someone, they stumble over their words. I'm not saying you should've given her a chance, but should've done what a decent human being does and not ditch them.\n\nAlso, your friends put their reputation on the line by vouching for you. If they thought you were a creep/horrible guy, they wouldn't have introduced her to you. So the fact they did means they thought of you as a decent person. You're not obligated to like her, but by leaving her with the bill and no words, it means the friends that vouched for you can't be trusted.\n\nAgain.

That provides a net good to society, useful information to her possibly leading to change and protects him.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t have the emotional wherewithal to express that single sentence, he probably shouldn\u2019t be dating. \n\nIn a perfect world oppressed people shouldn\u2019t have to advocate for themselves, but that\u2019s not the world we live in and there is no one better than one directly hurt by a dehumanizing thought pattern to call it out.\n\nDoing the right thing isn\u2019t always easy but ffs.
