What do your inlaws say about it? FIL and MIL? Has SIL ever given you a concrete reason for why she hates you? It is so bizarre.

That applies to fathers too. You are absolutely right to have nothing to do with this vile woman again. This is the point that your wife has to choose. It's her marriage or her sister.

If my sibling ever treated my spouse like that I\u2019d be cutting the sibling out of my life, not playing some kind of passive balancing act in which my sibling is pacified while my spouse is openly insulted.

Fixing your sister's behavior isn't something you or wife should do.\n\n>She pointed out that when we have kids (We're trying) she'll be their aunt, and we shouldn't deny them that.\n\nJust ask your wife what type of relationship she envision your kids will have with an aunt that will consistently try to break you up ?

Because kids bring an extra level of BS. Suddenly she wanted to be around me because of kiddos but still not acknowledging me. The story to her friends was I baby trapped him and stole him this went on while we had 4 kids. I existed to her to create them and that was it. My spouse went to bat for me time and again the only reason we had a relationship with his family as long as we did is because of me but we\u2019re no contact with SIL and Parents-in-law a decision he made not me.

I found out about the conflict when I was an older teen, and by that point I didn\u2019t really care. She was just another relative I rarely saw and oh well.", "NTA. Your wife definitely is however for thinking it is okay to have future children around her sister. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Just wait until she starts filing false reports against you involving your children- she sounds like the type who absolutely will. \n\nDo ****not**** bring a child into this scenario until tour wife\u2019s priorities are straight. This is toxic and she is not honoring your family unit by defending some claim or entitlement to a child her sister doesn\u2019t have.", "NTA.  Why would you want her around your future kids because she will do her best to make them hate you, or if she thinks they are like you she will treat them horribly.

You have the right to refuse to have anything to do with her, you don't have to accept the abuse.", "Wowwwwww, you are NTA, but your SIL def is TA. She's all kinds of fuqd up. The sanity of your relationship with your wife isn't worth the hassle of the disrespect and abuse you'll always receive. Consider the definition of INSANITY and just let your wife know that you don't want to keep her from her fam, but you're done being the punching bag for your SIL. Also, I think your wife should set some firm boundaries with her sis too, but that's for another post.", "NTA.\nI can see where your wife is coming from, but I disagree with her. You can absolutely deny your kids their aunt.\n\nDo you really believe she'll stop behaving this way if you have kids? Is there any doubt in your mind that she'll try to sow seeds of discord in your kids minds, or even try to humiliate you in front of them?\nEven if you were to try and give her the benefit of the doubt, is that a risk you are willing to take?\n\nI don't necessarily think your wife is TA either, as she agrees with you on her sisters behaviour. I just think that in her mind not having her sister in her life is an unfathomable idea. You can't tell her to cut her sister out of her life, but you can certainly cut her sister out of yours and put some firm boundaries up regarding her presence in your life and your home.", "NTA, that sister sounds INSANE. I mean, I'm not a fan of my all my inlaws, and I know they're no fans of mine, but that just means we let each other be. This is just aggresively hateful? Where does this come from?", "NTA. Your wife sucks though. If she agrees that her sister is \"insane\", why does she want her around your future kids?? I wouldn't even contemplate reproducing with this woman until she has your back.\n\nHave you spoken to the men in the family about this?

Your wife should be encouraging you both to cut contact AND should have stood up for you way before now.", "Your wife is ashamed of you and to be with you, or doesn't have a spine, or both.\n\nStill, why did _you_ say SIL was right about you being a loser? Are they all filthy rich and you some hibo she picked up from the streets? Is she the only one paying rent while you smoke pot and tell her you'll make it big someday?

It\u2019s just odd for someone to blindly hate someone this much.\n\nAlso, your wife needs to address this more firmly with her sister. When she accepts money or lets her behaviors continue like this without any real action it\u2019s clear she values that relationship more. You both should be no contact from the sister until she can apologize and show you some respect, but personally she\u2019d be cut from my life.", "Yeah, you are in a situation that you cannot solve yourself. This is a classic situation whereby the alpha female feels it\u2019s her role to vet the new males and force them to submit to her personally. There is only one solution and that is that your wife stands up to her sister, demands that the sister respects you, and says any offense done to you is an offense to her. That is sociologically what marriage is: you as the in-law get your wife\u2019s status in the family by virtue of your wife\u2019s choice to marry you. It\u2019s not the sisters choice. Period. Your wife has to say to her sister: there will be no disrespect to you, no talking badly about you in private or in person.", "NTA.

Your wife needs to have your back, yesterday.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't have to invite you only to deny you food.\n\nIt'd be the last straw for me too. I don't know if I'd even last seven years. She'd be dead to me by now.\n\n Your wife is going way too easy on her.", "If their aunt hates their father with a passion, there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to pour pure love on his kids. Would likely be the opposite, and it won\u2019t be worth risking your kids\u2019 emotional health to find out. So don\u2019t cave for the sake of the kids.

She's treated you this way for as long as you've dated her sister. \n\nWhy does your wife think this will change when you have kids? Or does she just not care and believes her sister being in your children's lives is worth you being treated like crap?\n\nI'd be worried what her sister might say/do to any of your potential children. What if she decides that your little one is too much like you for her liking and mistreats them?\n\nYou need to talk this through with your wife and get on the same page.

Honestly, if you have kids I wouldn't want her around them either. What will she say to them about you when you aren't around.

Her sister is actively torpedoing any future relationship of this kind.", "NTA. But you should ask your wife what would she when she does this with your future kids in the room?

Some people are just terrible and a percentage of those are women"]}
