Because kids bring an extra level of BS. Suddenly she wanted to be around me because of kiddos but still not acknowledging me. The story to her friends was I baby trapped him and stole him this went on while we had 4 kids. I existed to her to create them and that was it. My spouse went to bat for me time and again the only reason we had a relationship with his family as long as we did is because of me but we\u2019re no contact with SIL and Parents-in-law a decision he made not me.

Your wife definitely is however for thinking it is okay to have future children around her sister. It\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Just wait until she starts filing false reports against you involving your children- she sounds like the type who absolutely will. \n\nDo ****not**** bring a child into this scenario until tour wife\u2019s priorities are straight.

You have the right to refuse to have anything to do with her, you don't have to accept the abuse.", "Wowwwwww, you are NTA, but your SIL def is TA. She's all kinds of fuqd up. The sanity of your relationship with your wife isn't worth the hassle of the disrespect and abuse you'll always receive. Consider the definition of INSANITY and just let your wife know that you don't want to keep her from her fam, but you're done being the punching bag for your SIL.

I just think that in her mind not having her sister in her life is an unfathomable idea. You can't tell her to cut her sister out of her life, but you can certainly cut her sister out of yours and put some firm boundaries up regarding her presence in your life and your home.", "NTA, that sister sounds INSANE. I mean, I'm not a fan of my all my inlaws, and I know they're no fans of mine, but that just means we let each other be. This is just aggresively hateful? Where does this come from?", "NTA. Your wife sucks though. If she agrees that her sister is \"insane\", why does she want her around your future kids??

Your wife should be encouraging you both to cut contact AND should have stood up for you way before now.", "Your wife is ashamed of you and to be with you, or doesn't have a spine, or both.\n\nStill, why did _you_ say SIL was right about you being a loser? Are they all filthy rich and you some hibo she picked up from the streets? Is she the only one paying rent while you smoke pot and tell her you'll make it big someday?

It\u2019s just odd for someone to blindly hate someone this much.\n\nAlso, your wife needs to address this more firmly with her sister. When she accepts money or lets her behaviors continue like this without any real action it\u2019s clear she values that relationship more. You both should be no contact from the sister until she can apologize and show you some respect, but personally she\u2019d be cut from my life.", "Yeah, you are in a situation that you cannot solve yourself. This is a classic situation whereby the alpha female feels it\u2019s her role to vet the new males and force them to submit to her personally. There is only one solution and that is that your wife stands up to her sister, demands that the sister respects you, and says any offense done to you is an offense to her. That is sociologically what marriage is: you as the in-law get your wife\u2019s status in the family by virtue of your wife\u2019s choice to marry you. It\u2019s not the sisters choice. Period. Your wife has to say to her sister: there will be no disrespect to you, no talking badly about you in private or in person.", "NTA.

She's treated you this way for as long as you've dated her sister. \n\nWhy does your wife think this will change when you have kids?

Her sister is actively torpedoing any future relationship of this kind.", "NTA. But you should ask your wife what would she when she does this with your future kids in the room?

Not just because she might act like that around them or turning them against you, but what if your children look more like you than your wife?", "NTA from the fact your SIL seems to be the only person to have a problem with you.\n\nYour wife needs to think about maintaining her relationship with her sister if and when you have kids. She needs to consider how damaging it will be for her children if her sister is constantly putting down their father (the person 50% of their dna and a huge amount of their identity comes from).\n\nI always have a rule to never criticise parents (no matter how crap the parent is) in front of children as it\u2019s so damaging for them. It causes such conflicting emotions in them as they question their own value, feel they need to defend their parent but also question the parent. \n\nI agree with you that if her sister can\u2019t at least maintain basic civility then you shouldn\u2019t have any contact with her and neither should any future children. If your wife chooses to maintain a relationship separately that\u2019s up to her and you should not discourage it or try to make her choose.", "You have a sil and a wife problem. Until your wife makes firm boundaries sil will never stop. Wife is not advocating for you. Why would you want to bring a baby into the middle of this? Yall both need to go full nc with sil for a few months to make her understand there are consequences. Then when yall start to communicate with her again if she starts the disrespect then nc is a permanent thing. I just dont understand why your wife would allow this to continue and why she would be ok with her sister being in future kids life's with the way you are treated", "I would tell wife that until her sister stop it we wont try for baby because i would not want my kid around someone like that...just think what she will tell your kid \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\nNTA", "NTA. And I disagree with your wife. No contact, no nieces/nephews. She doesn't get to behave like that and still have a relationship with your children.", "NTA!  SIL obviously is, but so is the wife.  How has she not put a stop to this behavior LONG ago?  I would never subject someone I love to that kind of abuse.  And the fact that she is willing to let future children be poisoned against their own father rather than be \"robbed\" of an AUNT?  Ridiculous.  She needs to get her priorities straight and stand up to her sister or reduce/cut contact.", "Would the sister really like your future kids tho? YOUR kids that will have half your DNA.? What make your wife think she wont hate them equally like she hate you? Your kids are plain jane, your kids not good in math, your kids are messy, your kids got your looks, your kids will forever never be up to her standards. \n\nThe sister need good slap on the face (figuratively) so she can back down. Be petty, sometimes it's okay to be an ass to an ass..", "I would be ripping my sister/sibling a new one if they treated my husband like that,  and I would be sticking by his side and going NC with her until she changed her ways and sincerely apologized.\n\nNTA at all OP.  Don't let and future kids around her either.", "NTA. Your wife needs to get on board- if you have kids, SIL will absolutely spew her hate and do everything she can to turn them against you- you do NOT want that woman babysitting for you.", "Don\u2019t let that woman anywhere near your kids", "NTA, the only way you're the a hole is if you don't put your foot down. How on earth would her sister being in your kids life be a good thing? This amount of hare, how long until she tries to poison your kids against you. Or start insinuating you fuck them? Because she seems that unhinged. Start wrapping that dick up buddy because your wife doesn't have your back, she just wants you to drop it.", "Do not have kids with this woman until you sort this out, because her and her sister will ruin your life if you do and there is nothing you can do to stop them short of a restraining order.", "Info: Is there a reason she thinks like that?", "NTA and you have a wife problem and not a SIL problem.", " NTA - but I really think you and your wife should talk to her family about it. They should take a stand and tell her sister that SHE's not welcome until she starts acting like a grown up. It's such a shame for you and your kids to not be able to have a relationship with their grandparents, that includes being able to attend birthday parties ect.", "SIL is a combination of selma and patty bouvier and..satan.\n\nNta.", "NTA. Honestly I feel like your wife is the asshole for not stepping in and stopping this", "NTA \n\nYour wife is focusing on the wrong things. Your kids will be perfectly happy and healthy even if they never speak to their aunt again. \nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your\nFuture kids mind\u2019s will be poisoned by their aunty. if any of your kids come out looking like you I could also see aunty being a monster. \n\nSIL doesn\u2019t deserve to be involved in your family if this is how she treats you. Period.", "FUTURE KIDS!? What if this woman trash talks you to your own kids. If your wife isn\u2019t willing to be fully on your  side I would reaaaaly rethink bringing kids into this. Nta.", "NTA but I think you would be if you didn\u2019t sit and have a very good think about your future and how it looks. You\u2019re a stronger person than myself because I couldn\u2019t of coped with that for 7 years. \n\nWhat does your future look like if after 7 years your wife is still allowing this to happen? What does your future kids future look like? Your relationship with said future kids? Are you going to be okay with your kids seeing that? What if they start to copy that sentiment?", "NTA but your wife is the major AH for allowing her sister to disrespect you so blatantly. The fact that she wants this woman to be involved in your children's lives is a huge red flag. Do you really think your SIL will suddenly be respectful of you when she's talking to your children? And your wife has already shown that she values her relationship with her sister more than her marriage. If my partner treated me like this I would feel that I am not a priority in my own marriage and set firm boundaries or leave. \nWhatever you do, don't kid yourself that your SIL is going to be respectful of your role as the father of your children", "INFO: she says you're a loser with nothing going for you and you agree. Why? Are you employed? Do you do your share around the house? Do you sponge money off your wife? Why does she think that and why do you agree?", "No you don\u2019t have to be cordial to her at all for anyone\u2019s sake . Don\u2019t go to her house anymore nor should she be invited into yours , seems like your wife is on your side but you need to put your foot down about this. This broad sounds loco and honestly acts like you stole her lover from her.. not healthy at all. Nta", "Your wife needs to prove herself capable of setting boundaries with family before you and her keep trying for kids. The fact that this has continued so long and she keeps a relationship with her sister despite it is a huge problem. \n\nI think therapy-- for you, is a must. You need to figure out why you add *(accurate)* re: an insult lobbed at you by SIL, and why you have put up with this for so long. NTA, for it is about damn time you have boundaries... but still.", "NTA and thats extra important if you're having kids! Trust me, all the evidence suggests that missing one aunt is a lot less damaging to a child than watching an aunt continually disrespect their parent and internalizing the message \"It okay to abuse someone if they're family\"", "i'm a boring loser with nothing going for me.\n\nyou have a wife.\n\nyou, sir, have given me hope", "NTA. I would be very hesitant to have this woman around my kids.", ">She pointed out that when we have kids (We're trying) she'll be their aunt, and we shouldn't deny them that.\n\nYes you should. Your wife is ok giving your kids access to someone that will absolutely talk shit about you in front of them and encourage them not to respect you?\n\nNTA but your SIL definitely is, and so is your wife for expecting you to just suck it up forever.", "NTA, I would put any baby plans on hold until your wife can respect you enough to shut her sister down properly. 0 tolerance for bad behaviour. If you had a kid and they saw aunt treat you like this they might think hey I can treat Dad like shite too and there\u2019s no consequences from anyone. They loose all respect for you and then you\u2019ve a shitty relationship with your child. The biggest AH here is the wife closely followed by the sister imo. The wife has 0 respect for you to allow this to go on for so long with no consequences.", "NTA. What you shouldn\u2019t deny a kid is food, shelter, a safe place to sleep and a safe environment filled with love. I\u2019d argue you don\u2019t need extended family to fill that love role as nice as it is but what definitely goes against that is someone that undermines everything you and your wife built TOGETHER to give that to a child. Figure this out now before this baby gets here because her treatment of you will only get worse.", "NTA \n\n7 years of this? \n\nI would leave, but then again I stayed in an abusive relationship for 11 years and only managed to see how bad it was when I got out.", "NTA\n\nBut please don't have babies with your wife until this is worked out. Honestly at this point- I'd say until the SIL stops this behavior completely and apologizes to you; wife and you both need to cut contact. This is vile behavior and you.do.NOT.deserve.it. \n\n Can you imagine if you have children and their aunt is talking like this about you to your children?! That's poisonous. It's not okay and you deserve someone who stands up for you. She needs to be your champion! I'm not saying divorce but marriage counseling for you both at the very least.", "NTA. don't have kids", "NTA obviously. SIL is a poisonous female dog. And sorry but your wife is the worst one. She is your partner, your biggest supporter, your ride or die. If anyone treated my husband like that I would deal with it immediately and it would never happen again. If it even edged that way the person would no longer be apart of my life although I am struggling to see that I would forgive the first time. But 7 years, 7 YEARS!! Are you kidding me! I am so sorry you are surrounded by spineless idiots and have been conditioned to not expect your wife to be your supporter.", "NTA, your wife needs to lay down the law with your SIL.  If SIL is willing to apologize in front of her family and agrees not to publicly disparage you anymore then maybe being cordial could work but I sense there\u2019s no way that\u2019s happening.\n\nYour SIL will absolutely talk shit to your future kids about what a loser their dad is.", "OP will be the asshole if he allows his children around his SIL.

No way, she\u2019s (SIL) the problem, not OP and I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere she is and certainly wouldn\u2019t let my kids near her.

A lot of \u201cextended family\u201d led false reporting happens that way.", "Yeah, it might be worth hitting pause on trying for kids until this is resolved. Do you really want this woman berating you in front of your children? Do you really want her around your children at all with this behavior?

I'm on very low contact with my family and the only reason I even stay in contact is because my parents are elderly and I don't want to have a total rift.
