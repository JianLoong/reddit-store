Her sister hates my guts, plain and simple. She's quite literally the sister from the Sonic movie, she rarely has a conversation with my wife that doesn't include her telling her to leave me. She's said it's because I'm a boring loser with nothing going for me (accurate) and she could do so much better.\n\nIt's always been like this, and I gave up trying to fix it after we got married. She's done stuff like give my wife $500 in front of me \"In case you need to get out\" and asking to come to visit, only to change her mind when she finds out I'm home. I just ignore it or avoid her, but things came to a head recently.\n\nSIL was hosting a cookout, and of course we were invited. It was all going fine, most of my in-laws don't hate me, so I mostly just chatted with my FIL and his old man friends. The food was done, and I ask where we should sit, she tells us \"Sis you can sit right there\" points to me and says \"You aren't sitting at my table, and you aren't eating my food, take a hint.\" \n\nMost of the others were just confused, but I was done. I asked my wife if we could go, she agreed, and we went home. The morning after when I'd had a chance to cool off a bit, I told her I'm never going anywhere that her sister is ever again. That woman hates me, the feeling is very mutual, and I'm sick of pretending otherwise.\n\nMy wife said she understood, and even showed me the texts from an argument she'd had with her the night before, but thinks I'm overdoing it. She knows her sister is being insane, and she agrees that this needs to stop, but she thinks this is the wrong way to go about it. She pointed out that when we have kids (We're trying) she'll be their aunt, and we shouldn't deny them that.\n\nI'm willing to be cordial with my SIL for our future kids sake, but not if I'm going to be humiliated like that. She thinks I should just let her make her sister apologize and move on, but I'm fed up", "created_utc": 1683872952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fcxbp/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_wont_be_around_her/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife and her sister are though. I wouldn't let my sister do this to my husband a 2nd time let alone continue to let her for 7 years without consequence.", "NTA. Regarding future kids, why in world would you want someone modeling such horrid behavior for your children? The way she acts is a reason to keep your future kids far away from here. Please go no contact, this sister is awful.", "Is it possible your wife has been going to her sister in law to talk about issues in your relationship? It makes no sense for her to not stand up for you, and letting the behaviour continue.  Have you two had any fights or ever separated? \n\ninfo needed.", "NTA  \n\n\nThe sister is the clear instigator, you should not have to put up with that. Its possible she would be better with future kids, but you never know. Sometimes that kind of hatred passes on to the kids, and they definitely won't deserve that", "NTA. I\u2019d suggest going no-contact with SIL. Family relations aside-she\u2019s manipulative, malicious, and judgmental. Imagine if your kids were here already, she\u2019d be a terrible role model as their aunt.", "NTA. And it appears that you\u2019re not the one who needs to learn how to be cordial for the future kids\u2019 sake, it\u2019s her sister. Your wife says that she\u2019ll be their future aunt and you shouldn\u2019t deny them that, but imagine the kind of shit she might say about you to your kids? And if the kids see her being an asshole to you? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good influence to be around your children. Of course I don\u2019t know the whole story, but based on this post alone, the sister seems to be the problem here, not you. And it\u2019s valid to cut all contact from her since she can\u2019t even pretend to have a basic level of respect for you.", "damn, your SIL sounds like a major asshole. I don't know if you ever wronged her in a way (you might not even know about)  because just hating someone because he is a loser with nothing going for him sounds a bit over the top.\n\nMaybe you could stop being a loser since you agree you are one. And i'd propose to have a talk with the other family members and maybe they can talk to SIL and make her show her hate less obvious?\n\nNTA, based on this post", "NTA. And what happens when you have kids? Auntie going to tell them their daddy is a loser? And why do you think that's accurate? \nThis woman is actively trying to sabotage your marriage. Your wife should be more offended than you are in my humble opinion. I'd never be okay with someone like that possibly being around my kids when she could abuse them because they're probably losers just like dad!", "NTA of course. But you say (or agree) that you\u2019re loser. Hope you\u2019re taking steps to correct that, whatever being a \u201closer\u201d may mean to you. For your own sake of course, not because your lunatic SIL said so.", "NTA\n\nI can't imagine hearing someone constantly denigrate my SO for 7 years and think, \"I can't wait to have this woman around my kids\".  You know she's going to do everything in her power to poison your kids against you, right?\n\nHave you tried asking your wife to put herself in your shoes? If you had a brother who constantly shat all over your wife for the entire duration of your relationship, and he wouldn't stop no matter how much you tried, would she be excited to have that guy as the uncle of her children?  I bet she wouldn't.  Why should you have to put up with it?", "Sounds like your wife better wake the fuck up and decide if her sister's happiness is more important than a future with you and kids. You also need to decide if this is what you want for the next 30 years because it doesn't sound like your wife is going to get off the fence. Best make decisions before a baby makes them for you.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is right. That woman will be your children's aunt. You need to settle things before that happens.\n\nYour wife has failed everytime her sister has put you down. She should have shut her down. She chose not to.", "NTA. \nMy husband wouldn't even have to ask to leave if a hosting family member of mine said that to him, I would have already been out the door with him.", "NTA.  If she doesn\u2019t respect you as a person, she won\u2019t respect you as a parent.  I would not want that kind of toxic influence in my kid\u2019s life.  We teach them how to treat others and how to expect to be treated.  Are you actually okay with your kids seeing you being treated like that and thinking it is okay from their future partners and in-laws?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to reconsider until your SIL has a real consistent and unprompted change of heart.", "NTA. Save your future kids. What is the point of an aunt if it is a toxic, vile, one that hates your father and insults him? I had uncle that said crap about my dad- I will never respect them. That woman is of no use to your future kids or wife. Take a stand now. Do not let her interact with and poison your future kids.", "Nta but your wife is letting her sister insult you. She is doing the bare minimum. Ask her what if the tables were turned.", "NTA. But there is something very wrong with your wife. Every time her sister insults you, she is also insulting your wife\u2019s taste and choices. Your wife should be deeply offended both on your behalf and on her own. If anyone I knew, regardless of my relationship with them, made a habit of talking about my husband like that, they would quickly be cut out of my life. Why is your wife such a doormat? Why hasn\u2019t she told her bitch of a sister that she loves you, she chooses you and the bitch can be polite to both of you if she wants to be part of your wife\u2019s life? Your wife has let this bullshit go on far too long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she'll be their aunt, and we shouldn't deny them that.\n\nSure you should. She will be a terrible influence", "You have a wife problem. But you need to think about this, if you have children, either your SIL will try to poison them against you or she will hate them because of who you are. Either way having her around your children is a bad idea. Nta. But your wife needs to get on your side. She is allowing an enemy agent into your lives because she won't put her foot down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your wife really needs to defend you here and put an end to this. As they say, \u201cWhat you condone, you promote.\u201d She is allowing your sister to talk about you like this and it\u2019s promoting further slander. SIL needs to be called out by your wife. But it sounds like she\u2019s not that upset about it.", "NTA. You totally *should* deny any of your future children from meeting her.", "NTA and stop trying for a baby until this is resolved in a reasonable manner\n\nDoes she expect you to attend family events with your children and have them witness their aunt act like this?", "NTA. What do your inlaws say about it? FIL and MIL? Has SIL ever given you a concrete reason for why she hates you? It is so bizarre. Are you either (in her eyes) super attractive or perhaps really (in her eyes) unattractive? I mean she is clearly a bully and even without a logical reason it could be something as stupid as your physical appearance. I know cos I was bullied in school.", "NTA, she doesn't respect you.", "NTA but why are you still married to your wife? How is it she knows he sister is insane but you are overdoing it? Something is wrong with your wife.", "NTA.  Is your wife asking if she should deny your kids the opportunity to see their crazy aunt abuse their father?  Yes, they should be spared this \u201copportunity\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is the big problem here. Her sister would not be carrying on like this if your wife shut it down.  Its likely that your wife takes any and all complaints she has regarding you to her sister. I can't think of any other way that this has continued for so long.\n\nRegarding future children: the rule is that if you can't respect the parents, you have no relationship with the child. That applies to fathers too. You are absolutely right to have nothing to do with this vile woman again. This is the point that your wife has to choose. It's her marriage or her sister. And she is the one to blame for it getting this far.\n\nIf she continues to insist you be verbally abused and insulted like this, then she is a part of the abuse. You deserve better than that.", "I can't imagine allowing my sister to continuously disrespect my partner/spouse. And I say allow because all she does is ask her to stop. Not enough. It's needs to be clear boundary and distance from her sister when she steps over said boundary. What will the sister do once yall have kids. Will she bad mouth u in front of the child?  Will she treat the child bad because half the child is from u? Ur wife not seeing this is \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. I typed all that to say ur NTA.", "NTA but your wife is. She is the one that needs to draw the line with her sister. She needs to lay down the boundaries that her sister isn't allowed to cross. She has not got your back. While she agrees that her sister is nuts, she wants to continue to have a \"normal\" relationship with someone that attacks you remorselessly and she also wants your kids to have a relationship with \"crazy\". What about any of that is reasonable?\n\nYou both need marriage counseling to sort out your communication, boundaries and expectations going forward. You should not be fending off the wicked witch. That is your wife's job and she is leaving you to fend for yourself over \"family\". Right now, you should both be NC with your SIL for the foreseeable future.

And if her sister, why are you still there?", "We've never seperated or had any big fights, no. I assume she does talk about our relationship to her, that's fine. To clarify, she does always ask her to stop, she just doesn't listen.", "Yeah, I think the biggest issue here is that you and your wife don\u2019t seem to be on the same page. You\u2019re supposed to be each other\u2019s teammates. Why is she not shutting her sister down? If my sibling ever treated my spouse like that I\u2019d be cutting the sibling out of my life, not playing some kind of passive balancing act in which my sibling is pacified while my spouse is openly insulted. Wife\u2019s family sounds weird as hell for putting up with it.", "Yes, exactly.  And what if she takes a dislike to one of the kids who resembles the dad and insults them, or makes fun of them in front of the other kids?  That's damaging.\n\nIt's bizarre that this woman is still insulting her brother-in-law after so long.  If the couple is clearly together for the long haul and there are no problems like abuse for her to be angry about, I don't understand why she wouldn't just come to terms with the relationship and shut up. I also don't understand why her sister wouldn't be more forceful and insist she stops insulting the OP in front of her.", "The other potential outcome is she won\u2019t poison the kids against their dad but treat them like garbage because of who their dad is.", "Other than just telling her to stop, has your wife ever asked her what the issue is? There\u2019s something fishy here. The wife might be trying to save face by just saying stop. She needs to put her foot down and say stop treating my husband like that it\u2019s unacceptable , not just stop.", "True. Two great options to choose from."]}
