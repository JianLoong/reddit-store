I don\u2019t really think they\u2019re real, I think she uses it as an excuse not to do anything and to shift the attention/control her way.\n\nShe is with us for Christmas break this year for two weeks, and I have been miserable. She has been holding our entire house hostage. My husband and I love to play music on our surround system that plays throughout the house. Its one of the shared characteristics that made us fall for each other. There\u2019s something about the music going that just adds to our daily routines and makes our day better. It\u2019s an old house (1800s) with thin walls, so the music plays everywhere upstairs even though the system is only downstairs. My step daughter keeps asking us not to play the music when she\u2019s having a migraine and getting upset when we do, but this is not her house and I think it\u2019s pretty ridiculous for her to expect us to cater to her. She says she expects there to be talking and sounds of living, but that the music really makes it difficult for her to get better and makes her stay in bed in pain for longer. I think this is a BS excuse to try to wield power. No one is making her get out of bed, we just can\u2019t have her \u201cmigraines\u201d control our daily life.\n\nEDIT: yes, she was diagnosed by a neurologist and is on a lot of medications.

It\u2019s an old house (1800s) with thin walls, so the music plays everywhere upstairs even though the system is only downstairs. My step daughter keeps asking us not to play the music when she\u2019s having a migraine and getting upset when we do, but this is not her house and I think it\u2019s pretty ridiculous for her to expect us to cater to her. She says she expects there to be talking and sounds of living, but that the music really makes it difficult for her to get better and makes her stay in bed in pain for longer.

Listening to someone's symptoms is one of the key ways to getting a diagnosis in basically all medical conditions.\n\nYou aren't a doctor. Stop thinking you know how this works.", "Put in headphones.  You suck.", "Sorry to bring it to you but if you're consulting a neurologist for migraine they do an EEG and tadaaaa... guess what an EEG can! It can prove a migraine, especially a chronic one and if she is on that many medications the neurologist believes in your daughter having a chronic migraine - it is not like migraine meds would be given like that just because someone tells their doctor they had the symptoms since they can have real crappy side effects and don't go well with many other medications. And you say she is on a lot of those, that means the doctor is sure it is indeed a migraine and not one of the god knows how many different kinds of headaches. Migraine meds don't work for most other kinds of headaches, listen, a doctor doesn't throw them around without even knowing if it is indeed migraine and not something else. They don't just give out meds that can cause so many other problems just because MAYBE they make sense. Meds for migraine are not just simple pain killers, actually many migraine meds are no pain killers at all.\n\nSo, how about educate yourself a bit on a matter before throwing around completely unqualified false facts and accusations?\n\nBut I guess an EEG is no more than some magical trick that proves nothing because you don't understand how it works and how to read it and that is proof for it being no more than pseudo science or some kind of such.\n\nAlso no one takes these meds just to fake it. Like oh yeah, it must seem real, so let's take all these things again the pain, blood circulation, blood pressure, against the auto and all the stuff because you know, it must look real. \n\n\nNtm. that \"I have a headache\" is not what a doctor diagnoses as a migraine. Guess what, it needs several symptoms which must match.\n\nEdit: Btw. Yes, YTA", "There\u2019s no physical diagnosis of your bio daughter\u2019s oft-mentioned mental problems I\u2019m your husband\u2019s post, yet you have no problem believing those. What\u2019s the difference?", "But she WANTS them to be faked! And reality is whatever she wants!", "Yes dad is definitely TA too. In one comment OP says he knows she\u2019s not faking so why is he not advocating for her. I feel so sad for this daughter.", "I didn't know that either! Mine went away after I had my ovaries removed. No more hormones, no more migraines for me! I wish everyone could get rid of them, they're terrible.", "I bet OP is turning the music up louder just to get revenge for being asked to turn it down. She seems like the type.", "i agree with this comment and what is astonishing is the part near the end she says she has been diagnosed and on meds but a doctor cant really diagnos like she knows it better than any doctor i mean either this post is fake or she really really hates the stepdaughter", "I can\u2019t even talk when I have not taken a triptan in the first hour of onset so the migraine has gotten away from me. I can only barely whimper noises. Thank goodness my husband can now decipher those.", "That's great to hear!", "I\u2019m sorry for you, too.  Solidarity. \ud83d\udc4a", "When I was a teen I had crazy chronic migraines and everytime I was done with one, I genuinely felt sore in the head. \n\nI once told my mom, \u201cthere\u2019s no way these migraines aren\u2019t somehow hurting my brain permanently..\u201d\n\nI\u2019m really disappointed to hear that there\u2019s a link to stroke and dementia but not surprised, somehow.", "I'm like 99% certain this is the same person whose posted about her terrible stepdaughter before. She says she's not, but....yeah I don't believe her. The last post I saw from her also mentioned paper-thin walls and that detail is sticking out to me. And yeah, the stepdaughter is terrible and horrible and evil and everything that's wrong with the world", "I have to wait 6 weeks at least to hear if my insurance will cover it or not. I've tried dozens of medications and nothing has helped other than isolation. Even then, cigarette smoke, heavy perfume etc., trigger migraines.", "No, you just managed to somehow made your fake-migraine show up on the MRI!!\n\n/s", "I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s had one but can it really be confirmed if she\u2019s faking or not?", "I mean. According to her, all the kid had to do was tell the doctor the symptoms she is faking and they will load her up on meds. \n  \nI\u2019m sorry\u2026who WANTS to take medication so they can just pretend to be sick so they don\u2019t have to listen to Christmas music on full blast for two weeks?? \n  \n\u2026.wait a min\u2026she may be onto something with the Christmas music thing\u2026.", "The dad was officially voted an AH. He posted a while back asking if he was an asshole for moving all his daughter's pictures to the garage because his new wife and stepdaughter don't like seeing them.", "I also will get ones where my body feels completely out of proportion. My body feels like how you look when you look in a fun house mirror. The first time that happened I thought I was going crazy.", "Agreed! I'm grateful for it", "Hope things get better for you", "Yeah, there\u2019s almost no way a person can type out what OP just did and NOT realize they\u2019re an AH.  They may not *care* that they\u2019re an AH, but they definitely know they are one.", "Yes it can and some of the medications are freaking to hard to get without imaging.", "Brain imaging can not be faked.", "I hope one of the tiktok AITA accounts picks up this post and  someone puts the dots together. She at least deserves to know that your not someone she should ever feel safe around.", "Omg what?? That poor girl.", "What?! No wonder they're married, they're two peas in a pod!", "And the photosensitivity! Omg I feel next door to a vampire. \n\nOP is atrocious for doubting such a chronic, real, and yes - *verifiable* - condition.", "I get where my hands don\u2019t \u201cbelong\u201d to me. Today I was washing dishes and kept thinking someone else was next to me, washing them with me. Then I couldn\u2019t see, then someone drove a spike in my head, then I passed out on the meds. Super faking it tho, to hold my family hostage so they can\u2019t play their shitty music. Yeeeeep", "I know this is different, but I suffer from panic attacks and that's a very common symptom of them for me. I could never really put it in to words, but this does perfectly!", "I\u2019ll revise my statement you can not fake the scan to the dr. Meaning the dr knows what they are looking at is real. If she qualified for Botox, she really has migraines. Insurance does not just hand out Botox Willy nilly. It took me forever to get Botox for my chronic migraines.", "Interesting, she has botox and a monthly shot in her arm and then a bunch of things with \u201c-an\u201d at the end", "Agreed! I don't understand how someone could doubt someone in such pain. And Then to, not only prolong it, but to add to it is especially cruel.", "Even their ad in TV says 15 or more headaches a month - as someone who gets 1 to 2, whenever I hear that I\u2019m like - ef that, how do people function with 15 or more a month?!  Let alone 15 or more a month with a house full of people who don\u2019t support or empathize with your pain.", "So you still don\u2019t believe her after all this very solid proof? You just don\u2019t want to believe her because it\u2019s inconvenient to you.", "In my area, Botox will not be given without not only a CT, but you have to have been on other meds that didn't work. You're extremely cruel. Does your partner know how much you despise his child? Do you know what it's like to live with migraines, even semi chronic? I get them once or twice a month and I can't look at any light or hear any noise or I will throw up.\n\nYour stepchild having them multiple times a week sounds like absolute hell. Nobody wants to be bedbound all day.", "Do you really think this poor girl has spent all of this time and money with doctors and now gets monthly shots just to control you playing music in your house a few weeks a year? Monthly medications and appointments and needles just to rain on your surround sound parade for 1/10 of the year?! \n\n\nYou\u2019re insane. And YTA.", "Man that \u201cBe Civil\u201d rule is really chaffing my hide right now.", "so she's literally undergoing treatment for migraines and you're still over here thinking she's faking? you think she's getting shots for funsies? what is wrong with you?", "If insurance is paying for that, they clearly believe she has it.  Those treatments are $$$ to insurance.\n\nNot sure why that's not good enough for you to believe she's suffering incredible pain.  Why bother having her visit for Christmas if you're just going to torture her?  This isn't a new condition.", "Umm botox ain't got nothing to do with migraines.", "Oh I\u2019ve had that amount before. Hemiplegic migraines. It\u2019s hell. Not only do you have to have that many a month you have to have at least three failed preventative medications, I think at least two failed rescue medications (trying to remember cause it\u2019s been a while since we discussed it lol) and a bunch of scans and testing. We weren\u2019t sure what would and wouldn\u2019t work so my neuro started on scans and that\u2019s how they found the chronic small vessel disease. Parts of my brain literally got damaged from the migraines. People think of migraines as a headache but it\u2019s so much more. It\u2019s scary and damaging and for some types we have no clue why they happen, never mind how to stop them. So we stab in the dark. We try medications with side effects that sometimes feel like it\u2019s not worth it, we pray that they will work and for relief and yet they sometimes fail and back on the stab in the dark train ride we go.", "Yep. I went through hell to be allowed to try Botox. Hell all over again every 91 days getting all those needles to the face, head and neck.", "Yes it does. It\u2019s a very common treatment of migraines. Botox was used for medical treatments way before people decided to misuse it to paralyze their face. https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/botox-migraines", "Unlike the OP, I\u2019m sending you my sympathies; more power to you and I hope you are finding they are less and less.", "That's cool. Never heard of it. Glad I learnt it tho. We've tried a few different medications for mine and finally landed on a combo that worked but I was never even told about that one.", "At least in the US it\u2019s held back as a much later option since it\u2019s REALLY hard to get approved for through insurance. And if you can find a pill combo they much prefer that.", "I\u2019m sorry your suffering from it. I\u2019m not advocating for it. I\u2019m no expert at all. Just sharing that it is used as such. I hope you\u2019ll find something that works for you.", "It\u2019s 31 injections starting above your eyebrows and moving around the sides to the back of your head with two injections in your shoulders. You get it every 12 months. It\u2019s hard to get insurance to pay for it."]}
