Yesterday, however I got a call from my step-mom saying that their little 15pound mix has bitten 3 people and is extremely and irrationally dog aggressive.

He is a house dog, he\u2019s never been and never will be an outside dog. There are no pet hotels or friends to turn to so close to Christmas. I tried making compromises like keeping Dude in one room and just taking him out for walks but she is refusing. She says it will upset their dog too much.\n\nI finally told her that if there is no way we can have Dude somewhere in the house, I can\u2019t go. Everyone is mad at me now and my sister and a cousin texted me saying I am being overly dramatic. Dude is a protection breed and a lot of them are actually kept in the yard as guardians.

I saw my family and they saw me and the dog and they were visibly taken aback - who wouldn't be??\n\nThen some small 10 lbd rat dog (off a leash) ran up to my 130 lb dog, jumped up and bit the dog in the neck.  Think HUGE mosquito.  My poor dog went into a sit-stay and looked at me with the most mournful eyes *I have ever seen*.  I had to lift the rat-dogs body so he wouldn't tear my dog's neck.  Then started yelling for their dog's owner.  My dog was quiet, calm and mournful.  After that, my relatives were all happy to say \"Your dog is welcome anytime, anywhere.\"  I could not have paid good money to set up a scene like that on purpose.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t;t be going period. I hate it that so many people decide it\u2019s ok to not train their dogs. I used to love dogs but I\u2019m now terrified of them after being bitten multiple times. Dogs are even scarier when your almost completely blind.", "NTA they agreed dude could stay at their house, before they got their dog. For me I would wanty dog in the same house as a \"harmless\" that bites. If you did defend themselves in anyway they would be the big bad dog hurting the tiny thing", "NTA. Your mother's tiny and harmless dog has bitten 3 people, where I live, those dogs are euthanized because they have run through their chances. I have large breed dogs, not a single time have any of my dogs bitten anyone, my MILs small dogs have all bitten people, for the exact same reason your mother's has, theu have chosen to not be responsible dog owners and put in work socializing and training their dogs. As awful as it is, I think you should cancel your trip to see your mother as it would be a super stressful time for both you and your dog", "NTA. They have a problem dog so your good boi gets punished and ostracized and possibly sick from the cold he's not accustomed to? Nope. You are your dog's guardian and you need to protect him from this mistreatment. That's exactly what you're doing. Good job. Dude's best friend.", "NTA. \"Tiny and harmless\"? Don't make me laugh. Small dogs are always more aggressive because people just ignore the boundaries they set. I've been attacked multiple times by chihuahuas. I hate small dogs because of this. Fucking ankle biters(or anywhere they can jump and reach).", "NTA. Why should your dog be punished?", "Softly, ESH.  Your parents should have told you earlier.  However, the situation is what it is and causing a scene doesn\u2019t help.  Just politely bow out.", "Dogs are family. NTA. But your stepmom is.", "NTA.  Stop negotiating.  State your boundary.  Stick to it.  When issues like this come up.  When they change.  Give them one chance.  Then plan your own thing.  At this point.  You shouldn't go.  Even if they \"change\".  Chances are.  It wouldn't be good for you.  Or Dude.", "NTA. Dude is your family  just as much as your blood relations. I recommend staying at home and spending this holiday with Dude and your friends.", "NTA. Little 3 biter should be put down pronto.", "NTA. Your dog is probably like a child to you and your family is being AHs by refusing to compromise. Why can't their dog stay in the heated shed? (not really, but you know what I mean). Also they need to get it trained or eventually it'll rally hurt someone and have to be euthanized.", "NTA. Dude is not a property or a toy. He is a living being. Replace dog with kid and see if the reactions will be the same.\nBUT... YTA fir not providing us with dog tax!", "NTA. Your parents dog should actually be put down if it\u2019s bitten 3 people. The dog sounds like she isn\u2019t safe to be around people for the holidays.", "I had a 120 pound Rottweiler, if he acted the way one of my former bosses Pomeranian did I would have had to put him down for vicious behavior. I hate the double standard for small dogs. They aren't harmless because they are small. They are mean and just don't have the jaw strength to break a shin bone in their jaws.", "NTA. \"Tiny and harmless\" is not an excuse for not properly training a dog, little dogs get away with stuff that would get a larger dog put down as dangerous. If they refuse to train their tiny monster and expect you to keep your good boy outside it's perfectly reasonable for you not to go.", "Dude tax plz \ud83e\udd79", "op=NTA\n\nYou made conditions on your attendance and they changed the rules.  \n\nThey can live without your presence if they aren't willing to make any compromises(usually much easier to contain a 15 pound dog then a 130 pound one)\n\nWhy can't Stepmom's dog stay outside?  oh because that would be cruel? unfair? mean?--Yeah, ditto for your dog.    \nWhy can't they kennel, find a petsitter for their dog?--Yeah, ditto for your dog.", "NTA,but your parents are for not training their dog, too many owners of small dogs think they don't need to be trained becuase they think they are a harmless", "NTA, and good for you for not letting Dude\u2019s quality of life suffer for a single second.", "130 lb. Cane Corso protector vs 15 lb. Mix breed aggressive biter. What is going to happen when Dude kills your mom's dog? \nESH. You shouldn't expect to be able to take Dude with you on vacation & keep him inside. Your mother should not have a known aggressive biter in her home. There is enough legal liability to go around.", "Thank you for standing up for Dude \ud83e\udd7a youre a great dog parent", "NTA, \n\nAlthough at this point I wouldn\u2019t be going if they\u2019re going to share same space as aggressive dog. I\u2019d rather stay home and celebrate in comfort than put my dog in a uncomfortable position.", "NTA I don't go where my dogs aren't welcome.", "NTA. This is only a problem because they're irresponsible dog owners. If they had been doing their best to train out the aggression I'd maybe be more in favor of cutting them some slack... but they've done nothing and refuse to compromise. Dude isn't the one who can't behave himself, why should he be exiled to the yard?", "NTA \n\nStay home and cuddle that big puppers instead", "They agreed, so they need to honor their word!  \n\nWe have 2 very large dogs & my daughter visits every other weekend with her large dog. 1 of our dogs viciously tries to attack her dog when they\u2019re together. We kennel our aggressive dog in the office & she kennels her dog in the guest room for the 2 days she\u2019s here with him. \nWorks out perfectly! \nNTA!!", "YTA.  You asked and they answered, just because the answer wasn't what OP wanted, doesn't make them unreasonable than OP wanting to make the resident house dog miserable and put everyone in a bad situation.  It's fine if OP wants her dog to go on the trip and stay inside, it's also fine if MIL says there are conditions so OP backs out, it's not fine for OP to get mad at the parents for an unreasonable compromise on her part.", "NTA. Stay home. Dude sounds like better company.", "ESH. All dogs should be put away for gatherings.", "I keep thinking OP is lucky to have a good excuse not to go. Maybe the family is all jealous of OP that OP can opt out of the celebrations :)", "They waited until the last minute to communicate a critical part of the visit needed to change with no reasonable alternative to turn to. They got the dog over summer and made no effort to correct the dog's behavior. They've known this was an issue and knew OP was bringing her dog for months. She could have made arrangements with literally any communication about the issue. \n\nHard to say they aren't the AHs here, especially for rallying the rest of the family against OP because she understandably no longer desires to go.", "Small dogs are responsible for a lot of facial maulings. People think it's funny to stress them out and then put their faces next to them and then *bam*, Pam just had her face torn off by a very stressed dog. Because of this, small, aggressive dogs are actually more dangerous than larger dogs because people don't know to keep their distance.", "Chihuahuas are why I will never ever get a small breed dog. A childhood had one and that dog was a terror. So mean.", "Dogs usually love me. But almost every chihuahua I've met has bitten me,  including ones that were happily licking just seconds earlier.  I think that most of the commonly available small dogs are too deeply inbred by backyard breeders.", "My sister is learning this lesson the hard way as she's treating my new 35lb babygirl the same way she treated all of our small family dogs growing up--letting them jump on her, sneaking them human food, blowing in their faces, etc--and then getting upset at the results. \n\nAlso, NTA.", "That too, honestly. OP is avoiding several problems by staying home.", "Yeah, on thinking about it further, they're the assholes, because they won't just accept that OP can no longer go due to them changing the plans on short notice. I don't think they're the assholes for having a poorly trained dog in this instance as they're trying to manage the situation during Christmas, although in general they're doing a disservice to their own dog and other people/dogs.", "There's 100% a dog sitting service somewhere around. I'm sure you'll be able to find someone that can deal with a Cane  I don't need to google I'm quite familiar. Responsibility isn't really the issue it's a dog, it's how comfortable you are with someone else looking after your dog.", "A childhood 'friend' (read she frequently flipped between being my best friend and completely ignoring me) of mine got a dog a few years ago. Her correction method when he jumped up was to say in a singsong voice \"Now Ted, we don't jump up do we!\" Given our history I knew it wouldn't go down well if I tried to explain to her that's not how you train a dog so here we are several years later her dog still jumps up at every person it comes across.", "As a long time owner of a chihuahua I can confirm this as accurate.  Although, mine is 13 and honestly is pretty well behaved as long as you don\u2019t pick her up unexpectedly.  I get super annoyed that people don\u2019t train small dogs and make excuses that it isn\u2019t a problem bc they are small.  I trained mine as a puppy and while she is a total diva, she\u2019s not a monster like some of them can be.", "I\u2019m a dog trainer and honestly training the bigger dogs are way more preferred, small dogs most the time aren\u2019t trained since people feel their tiny and won\u2019t do much.", "I currently work as a vet tech and while I'll always be careful around any animal (especially because we're in a stressful environment) I'm extra cautious around small lap dogs. Lots of owners who never bothered to train them and have no control whatsoever.", "I'm not familiar with that bread so I really can't comment", "I inherited a chihuahua and I\u2019m sure she has one stashed away somewhere for strangers, even though she\u2019s adopted me as her human now.", "Can confirm they carry switchblades, mine threatened to stab me just last night for daring to give him prescription food and not the roast chicken he requested.", "Mine is 9, and about 8 pounds. She likes to occasionally pick fights with my 130 pound Akita. \n\nMy Akita just looks at me like \u201ccould you please do something about Cujo here?\u201d", "Thank you for being a reasonable person and a good dog owner.", "I totally agree. People are always super surprised to find out that my chihuahua isn\u2019t vicious! She barely even barks.", "This right here... almost no one believes that MOST dog injuries come from small breeds. They just don't cause as much damage so you don't hear about it.\nLittle dogs are also DOGS and need to be trained and treated like they are part of the family pack not a toy or favorite accessory.", "Is there a local chapter of Big Dog rescue in your area? Or a Cane Corso club? I\u2019ve always had extra large dogs as well and I\u2019ve some of the best resources through those type of organizations. \n\nI 100% agree with your stance on Dude being outside. I haven\u2019t had a Cane Corso myself, but I did have a Neopolitan Mastiff - their closest cousins. These dogs hail primarily from Southern Italy. They are NOT cold tolerant and have a high risk of hypothermia. My vet always said, if it\u2019s too cold for you to sit outside, it\u2019s definitely too cold for your Neo.  I don\u2019t know if this would help shut your family down, but maybe try telling them that your vet disapproves of this plan.", "Stay home with Dude.  Dude loves you unconditionally.  Return the favor.  Keep Dude safe.  Enjoy time alone.  But don't let this person.  Look after Dude.   \n    \nDude is more important than your parents.  Have a merry Christmas with him.", "Yeah, your mom pretty well screwed you over this year. She should have said something 2 months ago when it became clear her small dog was not going to get along with your large dog.", "Mine tries to act menacing but is bossed around by my 7 month old kitten so no one buys it lol", "The sweetest dog I ever dogsat was an elderly toy poodle, but she was very well trained and loved by her owners.", "I have a little chihuahua mix who is very good because she's well trained. She's about 8lbs and those teeth are so sharp! I'm reminded when I brush hers and feel them, especially the molars etc. It's no joke!", "Yes, exactly this. The greatest thing I ever did for my GSD/Husky mix is install a pet door. He loved being outside when it was cold and snowy, but having the option to pop right back in when he had enough.", "Agreed, I had mice as a kid. Definitely will make you bleed.\n\nI kept rats in my teens. Size is no indication of damage. I'd wear gloves around new rats because the first 24-48 hours is when they were the most jumpy and defensive. I still have scars on my fingers from getting nipped while trying to fill the dish with food during that time frame.", "German Shepherds: Don\u2019t forget loving and loyal too \u2764\ufe0f", "Oh, I love rats. They would let us play with the training rats with toys and handle them. The best was when they were small enough to go in the scrubs shirt pocket and be pocket rats. I love their little twitchy noses so much.", "Yeah I had a dog trainer that would use e-collar and he said so many people use it as a punishment tool instead of as the dog equivalent of tapping them on the shoulder. A person who is requiring it without knowing your dog is probably using it as punishment.", "Haha, I hear you on all that!", "Yes they are!! :)", "That's very true!! I have a friend that owns 3 German Shepherds, and she uses two Roombas to deal with their shedding, lol!"]}
