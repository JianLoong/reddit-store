Yesterday, however I got a call from my step-mom saying that their little 15pound mix has bitten 3 people and is extremely and irrationally dog aggressive.

He is a house dog, he\u2019s never been and never will be an outside dog. There are no pet hotels or friends to turn to so close to Christmas. I tried making compromises like keeping Dude in one room and just taking him out for walks but she is refusing. She says it will upset their dog too much.\n\nI finally told her that if there is no way we can have Dude somewhere in the house, I can\u2019t go. Everyone is mad at me now and my sister and a cousin texted me saying I am being overly dramatic. Dude is a protection breed and a lot of them are actually kept in the yard as guardians.

All of this to say that yes, protection dogs are usually outdoor dogs by nature of the role they fill. Additionally, while such a dog was bred to be outdoors, it\u2019s having not been throughout late summer/fall means it\u2019s body hasn\u2019t conditioned to be acclimated to cold temperatures. \n\nGuard dogs on the other hand are a different story. Something like a German Shepard bred to protect people would go where the people went.", "Oh, Pyrenees can.    Even ones that have always been inside family pets.   The need to be outside in all temps is STRONG lol.   But pyrenees have the fur for weather, and cane corsos do not.", "My friends did not mistreat him but he picked several bad habits like begging for food from the table. They also overfed him which is never good for big breeds like this. I cannot really complain as it was a favor and they did it for free. This year they are busy and out of town, I cannot rely on them even if I wanted to.\n\nMy parents got their dog end of June, beginning of July as far as I remember.", "I genuinely wanna visit. I have a great relationship with them and I only see some of my siblings when we gather there. They just put me in a spot where I really feel like I have no other choice. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out a safe place to leave Dude but there aren\u2019t any.", "A conversation during which fair and reasonable compromises are put forth by one party is a confrontation. I think OP worded that poorly with the phrase \u201cmaking a scene\u201d. Making a scene is causing a visual spectacle, not a phone conversation.  Had they brought the dog, had the stated discussion then stormed off in a huff and driven home, THAT would be making a scene.", "Worse, last year it got to -17C. He\u2019d go numb and be unable to move on a 20minute walk. I cannot rely on an old heater and a dark small shed.", "I hear you! I have a pit bull lab mix and he is the sweetest most lovey dog we've ever owned but the minute people hear pit bull they stop listening and assume the worst.", "There is not a single human in this world more important to me than my cat.\nOp, NTA. Stay home and enjoy the holiday spoiling your pup! Make sure document abd post you two loving your best lives \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Do you have a dog? Just wondering? If a dog is used to being with its human, locking it in a strange place for several days is just not fair. I've got a shelter dog who is happy to stay at home for hours but if I tried to put her in dog house, no matter how well heated, she'd think I'd put her back in the pound.", "It\u2019s not reasonable for him to be outside in a dirty, dark shed for 5 days, at least in my opinion. I value my parents but I cannot satisfy them at the expense of my dog\u2019s wellbeing. Last year it got so cold he\u2019d literally go numb from the cold and was unable to walk. I had to carry him home in 1F (-17celsius). If the heating goes out even for an hour he is toast. I cannot risk it.", "Making a scene because it was a 2hour conversation where we were going the same thing over and over again. They really want me there but Dude is outside. I say no, I\u2019ll just come back first thing after I find a pet hotel they say no, you NEED to be here for Christmas. Just a lot of arguing and trying to find solutions. \u201cMaking a scene\u201d as in not agreeing with what they have in mind.\n\nCane Corsos are not banned or restricted in my country. I love the breed and I love the time I put into working with him. I am financially stable and can afford dog sitters, trainers, pet hotels and have good friends that can lend a hand when I travel. I have gotten him knowing that he is a big responsibility and it is one I absolutely enjoy. I live alone in a big city, it brings me joy having him at home.", "I was with you until you started getting preachy about age and breed.\n\nClearly she can handle the dog as she is going above and beyond to make sure they are safe and cared for regardless of how it impacts her plans.\n\nAge is just a number, I know 60 yr olds that shouldn't have a dog, just sayin...", "That was basically the whole point. That everyone is mad at OP for saying they won\u2019t go.", "How does this make OP an A H? Her parents changed their minds at the last minute and she offered fair compromises before saying she can\u2019t attend if her dog isn\u2019t safe and warm. If she doesn\u2019t have a pet sitter, what are the other options?", "That\u2019s why op decided not to go.  She would only be ah if she went there with her dog without permission. It\u2019s their home they can change their mind about their invite and she can change her mind about going or not. If she just decides not to go it would not make her an ah.", "think maybe you need to read it again. the parents *agreed* to have OP bring the dog this year, they can change their minds bc of their dog whatever, but OP is in no way demanding anything, and has opted to just not go. how is OP an AH for deciding to just not go and avoid the conflict all together?", "The parents already agreed beforehand though.", "Not for days. Not for even 10 hours.  He's a living being, not a toy.", "huh? No you cannot leave a dog alone for several days and nights. You can leave a cat for a day or so with access to food and water, but not a dog. Where would he go to the bathroom?", "No, I am trying to find a pet sitter to stay with him at my place but it\u2019s Christmas, everyone is booked solid.", "...no, there's this thing where dogs don't have thumbs so they can't open their own food containers.", "I know exactly what you mean. My sister is a vet tech, and she's told me that absolutely NO ONE at her clinic will see a dog that's known to bite people. Which is really sad for the dog, of course.", "The average Chihuahua will cut someone, if given the chance.", "Yep. My husband has a nice scar from when his upper lip almost got ripped off by a mixed small dog.  Honestly I've had the most issues with small dogs.  Never any of our big ones.", "I got bitten by my cousin's psycho yorkie-poo while I was dog sitting for them (damn dog is actually prescribed *anti-psychotics* but my cousin decided to not have me give them to him because \"It will be too much of a hassle for her to do it and I don't want to scare her off\").  All I did was walk in the door, open the dog crates and the asshole charged me.  He bit me after I put his filled food bowl in his crate, he snuck up behind me and bit my hand.  Had I known he was insane I would have changed my approach when he went nuts, and I wouldn't have pretended like he wasn't there (most nervous dogs calm down when they're ignored).  Luckily, he didn't break the skin because I'm allergic to dog saliva and that could have killed me.  I did break out in hives within 30 minutes though.  After that, I wore heavy duty gloves and carried a yardstick for protection.  The other dogs also protected me from him.", "Yup we had 6 different kids admitted to the hospital floor for IV antibiotics after getting bitten by a dog and developing blood borne infections. At least two were small breeds: a rat terrier and chihuahua.", "A licensed and bonded pet sitter is so much cheaper than boarding. Still zero availability?", "Wow! Yeah, that\u2019s too far. Anyway, you can\u2019t risk your pet\u2019s wellbeing.", "Let it go this year.  Or visit the family you want to see at a different time this year, or next Christmas. \n\nThey're putting you in a bad spot, expecting you to just obey.  But your dog needs you, and he is your main responsibility. Trust that, and you'll be NTA.", "Time for you and Dude to make your own holiday traditions.  NTA.\n\nP.s. - my sister has a Cane Corso.  So smart!  The dog took one look at me and led me back to my car so I could drive away!  Lol.", "I wasn't indicating that they can't be outside, just that they don't want to be outside.", "Well either way you're nta but you shouldn't want your dog around an aggressive dog regardless of size especially with their attitude about it anyway. Bc if some reason their dog bit yours and yours (especially a corso) retaliated, your dog would be to blame on its sheer size alone. \n\nI also have a large breed and if I can't either make accommodations or be home at the end of the day I just don't go. It's kind of the name of the game with dogs in general. \n\nI'd assume they got this dog thinking it was fine and oops they suck at owning dogs, or the dog is combative for some reason, and they can't allow yours to have contact with theirs. But, either way you aren't the asshole for not wanting to leave your dog outside for days and you aren't the asshole for not wanting to go anymore bc of that.", "SO has a couple.  They can cope in the garage just fine when she's away.  They're just dogs, not children.", "Dark?  Can't you put in a camping light?  What's the heating source and why is it so unreliable?", "Yeah, still ESH.  2 hours of arguing means all the parties involved are dug in hard, and only assholes continue fighting and browbeating each other in that case---so you should have simply declined, and they should have accepted your decision about it. Done.", "Agreed, I was on board for the first paragraph, the second put me off, the third made me a bit angry. There are no bad breeds, only bad owners. Having said that, if step-mom\u2019s little dog has (checks notes) bitten three people does that mean little mix breed dogs are all aggressive and dangerous? Or maybe step-mom is a bad dog owner.   \n\nI had two Saint Bernards, both rescues, and both needed work but in short order were very well behaved dogs yet very protective of my entire family, which included three small kids and my small nephew M-F. To dismiss them because Cujo was violent would be absurd (yes, I know Cujo had rabies, point still stands). Any dog has the potential to be violent if neglected and it\u2019s needs aren\u2019t met.", "My comment about age was **in regard to restricting your life in your youth** by owning a dog that comes along with a lot of responsibility and accommodation. Not whether a young person can \"handle\" the dog, or anything in particular about the breed.", "I may have misread now that I\u2019m reading it again, I thought she was complaining about not being able to bring her dog and was making a scene, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not and just decided not to go, which is fair. My bad", "Yeah, it's honestly really sad for the dogs. It's not like it's a breed thing, just like with big dogs they aren't predispositioned to bite. But they don't get trained because they're 'little and harmless' and when they bark or growl they get 'oh isn't that cute' and whatever caused them to react is ignored. They learn quick that they have to be very aggressive for even the slightest thing to be taken seriously.", "I\u2019ve been calling all day. Only one has availability but she usually takes on small breeds and is very reluctant. I set up a meet with her tomorrow to see if she feels like she can handle Dude but she said I better look for other options. If she agrees she wants him muzzled with an e collar on walks. I\u2019d have to think really hard, I wanna meet her first. I don\u2019t wanna leave them together if she feels unprepared. \n\nNo one else has availability. I even joined a few waiting lists in case anyone cancels last minute.", "They can cope because that's what they're used to. You cannot just put an inside dog outside in a new environment and expect them to be okay with it.", "Just so you know, kids cope fine locked in a garage too. It's only a few days./s", "You keep your dogs in your garage for multiple days? Are garages different where you live? Where I live a garage is a windowless room, often without light source, no heating, bare cement...\n\nBut also: they cope okay in YOUR garage which they're used to. They're not separated from their family in a strange place as would be the case here.", "It\u2019s a central heating system fueled by a wood burner. The tubes run through the shed and have a on/off turning system. If there isn\u2019t enough wood burning or if all the heat sources in the house are turned on, it diverts energy to the house and the shed heating automatically shuts off. I\u2019d have to go and check constantly and I\u2019d be scared during the night as it is most likely to turn off then.\n\nI can put a light in the shed but it\u2019s still windowless.", "Exactly! Wish she could find little dog a better home, that's who I really feel for in this...", "Facts. My in laws currently have a min pin & they did nothing to train this dog.  She nips, bites, jumps all over you.  But when we (husband and I) complain about it we get told she's little and its not like she nips hard.  I wish more people took pet ownership seriously.", "OP do not let this woman take care of your dog. If he doesn't normally need a muzzle or e collar, and she's requiring it without meeting him, then she is clearly not the right fit.", "Is there any chance you could find a pet friendly hotel or Airbnb where you could stay with him and then go visit? Probably too late for that, too, but maybe an option to look for?", "I wouldn\u2019t use Rover or whatever. And this gal sounds scared and that could set your dog off.", "Bruh this sucks for you and Dude. Your family really left you with *one* option and it sucks if you wanna come meet with them. \n\nSide note Dude is a kickass dog name #justice for dude", "So what?  That's life everywhere but cloudcuckooland.", "Dogs \u2260 kids.", "No, it has windows and attached to the house, so there's indirect heating.  OP's family's shelter is heated too.  So what if it's a strange place?  Wild dogs survive and thrive outdoors in dynamic situations.  Have we inbred dogs to the point they can't cope at all?", "If it were me, I'd put a hot water bottle in the dog's bed as insurance or perhaps run an extension cord to power an electric blanket if the dog can be trusted in that regard.  If not, you could consider a small electric heater inside a protective cage.  A power-failure alarm is only a few bucks on Amazon if you're really worried about an outage while you're sleeping.", "yea I watched a red heeler and didn't know exactly how to corral her. She didn't like that at all (fabulous animal BTW). Dog showed some aggression (fearful), I remembered a tip from the owner and employed method. Worked like a charm. But it could have gone bad.", "I have no idea what you're even trying to say.", "A pet is NOT a wild dog. A pet is used to certain people and places and doesn't understand why it will suddenly be separated from the owner in an unknown place. Some dogs may cope, others may react with destructive tendencies or become highly stressed out.\n\nMy dog hates routine changes (she's getting better at it though) - she'd probably lick her paws raw because of stress. And no, she's not inbred, she's just an old traumatized shelter dog who finally has people she can rely on.", "We talked about this with my parents. An electric heater or blanket is a serious fire hazard if knocked over or if it malfunctions. \n\nEven if we get a power-failure alarm that can fit this decades old system, it can potentially take hours for the system to generate enough heat to reach the shed. I\u2019ll either have to stay with him in the shed during that time and have an electric source of heat monitored or I\u2019d have to go around the house and turn off heating in different rooms which is just stupid as people in the house will be temporarily inconvenienced. \n\nThe shed\u2019s main purpose is storage, it was never designed to be kept warm. My grandfather ran tubes through there because he had a workshop he used in early autumn and late spring and wanted some heat. The heating system is faulty, simply because he never imagined anyone would need the shed warm for days in winter.", "That virtually everyone/anything copes with new environments; this overwrought concern for a dog's fee-fees is ridiculously indulgent.\n\nAre you seriously saying that dogs can never be boarded at a new location?", "So you can never board your dog at a new kennel that just opened down the street, for example?", "A power failure alarm just plugs into a receptacle in your bedroom if I'm not totally mistaken.  If the power goes out, that constitutes an emergency; surely your parents would make an exception to allow him in, wouldn't they?  If not, I'd pack up and leave.  Or, if they have a gas range or grill, there's always the hot water bottle option until power is restored.\n\nAn electric heater inside a protective cage (like a pet cage, for example) secured to the floor with no access for the dog to the cord should pose no real additional risk, assuming your wiring is up to standard and you're not overloading the circuit.", "Can't argue with someone who thinks that dogs don't have feelings or doesn't care about them. Hope your SO doesn't ever leave you in charge of their dogs.", "I definitely couldn't do that, no. When I go on holiday, I take my dog with me. If she can't come, I don't come. If there was a medical emergency, I'd still do it but not just to have fun.\n\nPrevious dogs I had were a lot more easy-going. I never put them in kennels though, I always had friends or family members watch them, either at my house or at theirs - but only if the dogs were familiar with the person and the place.\n\nI remember an ex-boyfriend boarding his dog with a family he vaguely knew and the dog ended up having to stay in an outside space. The dog basically barked so much he was completely hoarse when my ex brought him back home. And it's understandable - a dog has the mental range of a toddler. What would a toddler do if you left them in a strange place with strangers?", "I would never equate a dog with a human.", "And I'd never mistreat a dog. I guess we'll find little to agree on."]}
