{"id": 25551, "submission_id": "161tyqo", "title": "AITA for refusing to host my younger brother", "selftext": "My mom (54F) have been living with me (30M) and my wife (30F) for the past four years. She is separated from my father (66M) but they are not officially divorced. I have a sister (20F) and a brother (25M). \n\nWhile living with us, I tried to make sure my mom really feels as she is in her home. We live in a small appartement, with 1 bedroom, 1 office (I used to do 100% work from home and my wife dies 50%) and a living room with one of those fancy sofas that turn into a bed, this is where my mom sleeps.\n\nMy mom does not work, so she lives on our expenses. I also try to give her pocket money (10% of my salary). Lately I found a better job and we were looking to move to a larger home so my mom could have her own room and also because my wife is pregnant. I also started sending money to dad to help with my siblings studies expenses (15% of salary). \nThings were going well, sometimes my dad would rant that I don't call enough. I try to call everyone once a week, but no more. But that's about it.\n\nLast week my brother found a college he will study in in my city, and around the same time my mom said that she will go live on her own. I was worried about her having no job and no skills, but she insisted and I felt like she found someone to live with but was just ashamed of telling me. So I wished her good luck, told her that I will keep sending as much money as I can and that she can come back whenever she wants.\n\nYesterday, as I was in vacation she sent me an extremely hurtful message. Saying that I am egotistical, that I don't care about my family and that I  just despise my family. I was so shocked and hurt that I, a grown ass man, started crying in the middle of the street. The reasons she gave for the message are really small things, such as me asking her to let me know before bringing my brother unanounced for a week (happened once, and it was more a logistic problem for me not that I don't want him to visit), or me responding with only a hearth emoji to my brother saying happy birthday (late). \n\nAfter analysing the message, I feel like the real reason is that I didn't propose to host my brother. Here is the catch, my brother is a mess, he is extremely spoiled and sensitive. He is the kind of person who can't do a single dish, and would start a huge fight if you ask him to. There isn't a single time he visited us without it turning into galactic family fights started by him interacting with mom. These are also the only moments we had problems in the house. So I spoke with my wife and we both decided that with the baby coming it would be just too much for us to have him around for two years. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Spelling", "created_utc": 1693052996, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161tyqo/aita_for_refusing_to_host_my_younger_brother/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not obligated to support your family members. Your wife and your baby need to be your main priority.

You might want to make it clear that is not going to happen.", "Nta. Nothing you've done is bad or rude at all. Most kids don't give their parents 10% of their income. It seems like their may be cultural expectations at play?", "NTA. And stop giving her money. It's apparent she doesn't appreciate you. You need to focus on your household and thr kid you have coming", "You held the fact that your wife is pregnant til the end.\n\nI think you should have led with that.\n\nYou live in a very small apartment.  You were able to live with your mother because she seemed to respect your boundaries, with a few mishaps.\n\nYou are pretty sure your brother won't be able to respect those boundaries.\n\nAnd you will have an infant soon.  Infants disrupt sleep and make noise.  the way you describe your brother, he would be unable to deal with it.\n\nNTA for not  hosting your brother for two years.", "Who died and left you to parent everyone? Your mom depends on you, your dad at least in part, your younger siblings... this is very unhealthy and if you keep it up your sibs will grow to be flaky, dependent adults who don't know anything about how life works nor will they be able to provide for their respective families if they have any. Do you really think it's okay for you to provide for everyone and enable them to be useless leeches?\n\nYou married and will soon have a baby -- time to prioritise them.\n\n(Also, looks a bit like mum didn't necessarily find someone else to move in with... she was just guilt-tripping you. Shameful for her to be this mean to the one person who's been providing for everyone).", "NTA either way, but is she mad at you for saying no to letting your brother live with you for two years or just because you didn't offer?\n\nHe is an adult and can figure out his own housing accommodations while he's in school. You are not required to let him stay with you for two years in a small apartment while you're trying to make a baby. It sounds like you're not even opposed to helping him out from time to time if he needed it, but two years is a long time and he can find a roommate or something for that time. Or live with your mom.", "NTA.  Your first loyalty should be to your wife, especially since she's pregnant.  You must ensure that her life is as stress free as possible.  Having your brother move in is the opposite of what she needs.   You need to be clear with your mother on this - you have to do what is best for your family - which means you, your wife and your baby.", "NTA. Dear mom is setting you up for more money. Don't fall for it. Your father can take care of her since she is still his wife. She's been using you for a free ride for years - while not working. That's shameful behavior.", "NTA.  It sounds like your brother is the golden child.  I think that you did the right thing by helping your mother out, but it is obvious that she does not value the help.  If she indeed does favor your brother, then it is probably good that she is moving out (likely with younger brother).  Otherwise he would be over at your place a lot visiting mom.  I think that it is very rare for people like your brother and mother to change, so going LC may be most beneficial to everyone.", "NTA. You will have a baby, a huge extra job for you and your wife.
