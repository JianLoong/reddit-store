Our daughter\u2019s birthday was soon and we agreed on doing birthdays together and Josh asked if Zoe could be there too since all of our friends were coming anyways. \n\nI was going to say no but I technically had no reason to.

It's really hard.  And then everyone at your child's b'day paid a lot of attention to a very pretty girl who might end up with your child's dad.  And you were so jealous you couldn't stand it, and you were very rude and mean to her.\n\nStop.  Take a breath.  You can fix this.  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to own up to it and apologize to Zoe.  You have to be absolutely sincere and mean it.  Let her know that you see how nice she is, and you appreciate how sweet she is to you and to your baby.  Let her know that she's welcome and you'll never treat her like that again.  Especially if she's going to end up with Josh, who you describe as a very good father, you want a good relationship with her if only for your daughter's sake.\n\nThen you need to apologize to Josh.\n\nFinally, you're a mom.  It's important for you to start modeling the kind of behavior you want your daughter to grow up with (even if at 1 year old she doesn't get it, start now!).", "YTA\nShe did NOTHING to you. You were unforgivably rude to her, for reasons that are purely internal.", "YTA, and you're letting your jealousy show.

You seem to be very jealous. She was just recently back and a lot of people hadn't spoken to her in a long time. Of course, they want to talk to her much. It also doesn't sound like your daughter was unhappy at her party. So the only person with a problem here are you.", "ESH. \n\nIt would have been amazing if you had the grace to endure that party and express your feelings later.

And if her and Josh never did anything together while you were dating and it just all came from his friends and your friends then the friends are assholes. I understand your emotions.

I totally understand that she would make it uncomfortable for you in that case. And that\u2019s OK. But don\u2019t take it out on her. Realize that those are your emotions.", "YTA - your daughter is 1\n\nWhat did you expect a party for her to be like? Of course the adults were going to focus on other adults, a 1 year old isn\u2019t exactly a party animal \n\nIt\u2019s not Zoe\u2019s fault everyone focused on her, she was being nice to you and your daughter and you were rude to her for no reason", "ESH. Yea you weren\u2019t nice, but I feel like everyone is missing that this was supposed to be your daughter\u2019s birthday party and it turned into a party for this girl.

Sounds like you're jealous or not as over Josh as you thought. You had a child very young and that means you need to grow up fast and put your child first so she feels comfortable with both parents.", "YTA. I get how you feel and all, I would've felt the exact same way. However, asking her to leave when she'd done nothing wrong and had been nice is not fair. It sounds like you're jealous of Zoe and the attention she was getting, and while I can empathize with that, it's not fair to punish her.", "YTA - you let your jealousy get control over the rest of your emotions and threat Zoe as plague, even if she didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe good thing is that you know she didn't do anything wrong, so at some level, you understand that the way you behave was not nice.\n\nYou are young, I'll suggest talking to a professional to work on your self-esteem and how to handle your emotions to dont repeat this kind of situation in the future.\nAlso try to apologize with Zoe and Josh, because what you said to her was more a reflection of your insecurity than whatever Zoe did during the party.", "YTA, not even close", "YTA. Your child is still at a young enough age that they won\u2019t remember who came to this birthday, and it seems mostly adults gathering. You and Josh are split up amicably and he is one of the rare young fathers who is pulling his parenting weight. Zoe went out of her way to be kind to you and it isn\u2019t her fault that people are excited to see her after a ling absence. The situation sucks but it wasn\u2019t like she intentionally showed up to steal focus. \n\nIt also sounds as though Zoe may end up being your child\u2019s step-mother so if you and Josh continue co-parenting she is going to be in the picture and  creating a tense relationship from the beginning is going to make parenting with her very difficult and possibly lead to problems your child will pick up on. That is unhealthy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want potential tensions and problems for years to come then you need to apologize asap and maybe take her out for some one on one time together to explain woman to woman that you understand it wasn\u2019t her fault or intention to steal focus at the bday party and why it was a final straw after hearing nonstop from literally everyone who never really gave you much of a chance with Josh while ypu were together that Zoe is like so totally awesome and perfect for him made you temporarily crazy and that you appreciate how she actually is incredibly sweet and inclusive of you and ask for forgiveness and another shot.", "YTA. That was so rude of you. She asked you a civil question; you could have told her you felt the attention was more on her than on your daughter. Instead you were nasty to her.", "YTA.  It's time to grow up.", "YTA- You we\u2019re rude to this girl out of jealousy. The fact that you mentioned how pretty she is more than once is evidence of this. She was not being rude when she came to the party. Her friends were excited to see her. His father was excited to meet her. \n\nYour anger at her is because her friendship with your daughter\u2019s father was threatening to your relationship and you are still holding that grudge. I can understand it, but that doesn\u2019t make you any less of an AH.", "YTA\nThat just made you look petty and jealous. Your daughter is 1. She had no feelings of being undermined at her birthday party, you just projected them. Your parents sound like they\u2019re childish if they think you come out of this looking good.", "NTA\n\nIt was a birthday party for your daughter, not a welcome home party for Zoe.", "ESH\n\nYou were incredibly rude to her for no apparent reason. You cannot possibly hold her accountable for how others distribute their attention. She wasn\u2019t dancing or tables or trying to make a TikTok. She was just being nice and mingling.\n\nAt the same time, others\u2019 reaction to her presence make me think that her and your ex haven\u2019t presented as a couple to his parents before the party. Parties, weddings, funerals, baptisms and so forth aren\u2019t appropriate places to make big life announcements so they were socially gauche for that.\n\nStill, your behavior was over the top.", "YTA. She didn't actually do anything to deserve to be sent away. It's not crazy for people to talk about someone among them who has just moved back.\n\nAre there some unresolved feelings or issues towards your ex? If so, it sounds like it would be good to give those things a place to be able to co-parent well.

Not like you.  YTA", "\"Nothing ever happened but you know\"\n\nNo, no we do not. Know why? Because two human beings can talk to each other and be friends while having different genitals, and it not be a sexual/romantic relationship.

Your opening part gives it away. You\u2019re immature. Grow up. You\u2019re a parent, act like it. You made your daughters birthday about your feelings and blamed them on someone who really did nothing wrong. Your jealousy ruined your own relationship with the father and now that the father is happier without you, you\u2019re bitter. Look at yourself and ask yourself \u201cwhy is he happier without me?\u201d You\u2019re a miserable person who brings others down around you. He got out and is better for it.

Had you pulled her aside and politely said \"hey I get that everyone is excited that you're here, but this party is for my daughter and it would mean a lot to me if you could help me shift the focus to her for this event.\" The focus should be your daughter. Not you, not blame on her, just the kid. Making her enemy #1 over a guy it doesn't sound like you even want, is only going to put your daughter in the middle. I get that it's a soft spot for you, but the truth of the matter is that even if Zoe is his *\"perfect match\"* or whatever, it is not because she is better than you. It is because they are more compatible with one another. Its not a competition. You also deserve a perfect match, not someone who makes you feel like you'll never really compare to the one that got away like Josh did when you were together \n\nYou could even tell her \"throughout my relationship with him, people constantly brought you up to the point it did become a factor in our breakup.

Since you are going to be in his life and that means in my daughter's life, I am going to try to work through that but I just wanted you to know *why* this is difficult for me.\" You should apologize, explain where you're coming from, and tell her that you will be working on it", "If she is going to be around, and around your daughter, I would advise you to send her a message simply explaining all of how you feel.

The hurt goes away and I'm sure you'll meet someone you just click with eventually. You're young you've got your whole life ahead of you. Just focus on being the best mom and role model for your daughter. I would say apologies are due to Zoe. Because if she starts dating Josh, she'll be a part of your daughters life and you don't want her to be in the middle of you and Zoe fighting because you want her to be happy and loved.", "OP, I think you know the answer to this question already. \n\nThe reality is that you and your ex are going to be in your daughter\u2019s life, and therefore each other\u2019s lives for the foreseeable future. He\u2019s going to date other people, maybe even Zoe. He might even marry her. You\u2019re going to be with other people too.

She does say that her parents were \u201con her side\u201d. \n\nI mean yes YTA for how it was handled, butttt I could understand how it happened depending on the details.", "It could even be that Zoe moved away to get away from Josh and his friends.  She could be just as frustrated with all this pairing-up-talk as OP.   If it was written in the cards then I think it would have happened already.", ">No one compared OP to Zoe. And from the post no one said anything about her while OP and Josh were dating\u2026\n\nOPs comments say otherwise. Sounds like Josh never shut any of it down because it was bad enough that it was a large enough factor in their breakup.", "She would have to be pretty socially unaware to not realize that at someone else's celebration she was the ONLY subject to talk about.", "This, right here. The friend group kind of sucks on this one. OP was rude, but she may have never thought anything of it and Zoe may have never become an issue if not for their comments - and making them in her presence was also rude.", "Especially since being a teen mom is already hard enough when it comes to comparing your life to most people your age.", "That is why you have a party for family only.......let the friends go.", "It\u2019s supposed to be about the kid and the difference they have made to their parents lives. If the family honestly couldn\u2019t talk about the kid\u2019s milestones and how the kid was or wasn\u2019t like their parents as babies the focus could easily have been on how the parents are doing as parents. Are they a team? Has parenting come easily? What have been their inspirations as parents? How does the kid fit into the family (especially if it\u2019s the first grandchild.) Making the party about one guest is such a poor move and is a massive sign of being a shitty family.", "She said that her ex and Zoe talking on the phone was part of the reasoning for their break up, not that she was being compared to her.", "I would advise you to send her a message simply explaining all of how you feel. \n\nOr send her a link to this and apologize!!1", "The friends were constantly telling the OP that she would have never had Josh if Zoe hadn't moved away and so on. That stuff adds up over time.", "I thought the OP was going to protest Josh bringing Zoe as the new GF and not wanting to have her there because Zoe and Josh hadn\u2019t been together very long. \nNot simple jealousy. This Zoe must be something very special.  But, like NoChance_WindowsSuck states there will be another one(s)", ">. If the family honestly couldn\u2019t talk about the kid\u2019s milestones and how the kid was or wasn\u2019t like their parents as babies the focus could easily have been on how the parents are doing as parents.\n\nOutside of pandemic times, most people aren't sequestering themselves from family and friends. This conversation happens throughout the year.", "I think this would be a great idea", "Because having her friend group constantly compare her to Zoe and say repeatedly that she is only second best compared to Zoe is likely going to influence how she behaves.", "I am glad we can all stand back and criticize after the fact. I would have been upset too. A day for her daughter turns into Zoe day.\n\nShe may have reacted poorly but it is difficult when the crowd is gushing over Zoe......Zoe had the easy part since everyone adored her. It is so sad that poor OP is human and has feelings.", "She came to AITA and asked, she's not being dog piled by internet strangers: telling her whether she's in the wrong is the entire point of the sub, and the entire reason she's here", "I agree! While I do feel she was rude to Zoe, I personally think a special event for someone else is not the time to introduce a new partner", "And she has already gotten that judgement and figured it out, constantly going \u201cYTA OP!\u201d After they\u2019ve already realized it is just beating a dead horse.", "no, allude. they were right the first time. don't be that person.", "How embarrassing for you......", "She said even her friends were making comments about Zoe."]}
