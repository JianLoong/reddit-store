Apparently Zoe and Josh never dated but everyone insists that they would\u2019ve had she not moved away. One of the first things Josh\u2019s friends said to him when we broke up was \u201cyou should call Zoe up!\u201d I\u2019ve heard plenty of how perfect they are for each other.

Nothing ever happened but you know. \n\nWell she moved back into the area some weeks ago and I haven\u2019t seen Josh this happy in a long time. Our daughter\u2019s birthday was soon and we agreed on doing birthdays together and Josh asked if Zoe could be there too since all of our friends were coming anyways. \n\nI was going to say no but I technically had no reason to. She\u2018s been super nice to me and our daughter and it\u2019s not like Josh and I are together anymore. \n\nShe came and everyone\u2019s attention was on her.

I told her that her whole presence offends me and that I\u2019m tired of hearing about her all the time. I then asked her to please leave. \n\nI heard her call me a bitch but she just quickly whispered something to Josh then left.

It's really hard.  And then everyone at your child's b'day paid a lot of attention to a very pretty girl who might end up with your child's dad.  And you were so jealous you couldn't stand it, and you were very rude and mean to her.\n\nStop.  Take a breath.  You can fix this.  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to own up to it and apologize to Zoe.  You have to be absolutely sincere and mean it.  Let her know that you see how nice she is, and you appreciate how sweet she is to you and to your baby.  Let her know that she's welcome and you'll never treat her like that again.  Especially if she's going to end up with Josh, who you describe as a very good father, you want a good relationship with her if only for your daughter's sake.\n\nThen you need to apologize to Josh.\n\nFinally, you're a mom.  It's important for you to start modeling the kind of behavior you want your daughter to grow up with (even if at 1 year old she doesn't get it, start now!).", "YTA\nShe did NOTHING to you. You were unforgivably rude to her, for reasons that are purely internal.", "YTA, and you're letting your jealousy show.

You seem to be very jealous. She was just recently back and a lot of people hadn't spoken to her in a long time. Of course, they want to talk to her much. It also doesn't sound like your daughter was unhappy at her party. So the only person with a problem here are you.", "ESH. \n\nIt would have been amazing if you had the grace to endure that party and express your feelings later.

And if her and Josh never did anything together while you were dating and it just all came from his friends and your friends then the friends are assholes. I understand your emotions.

I totally understand that she would make it uncomfortable for you in that case. And that\u2019s OK. But don\u2019t take it out on her. Realize that those are your emotions.", "YTA - your daughter is 1\n\nWhat did you expect a party for her to be like?

Yea you weren\u2019t nice, but I feel like everyone is missing that this was supposed to be your daughter\u2019s birthday party and it turned into a party for this girl.

Sounds like you're jealous or not as over Josh as you thought. You had a child very young and that means you need to grow up fast and put your child first so she feels comfortable with both parents.", "YTA. I get how you feel and all, I would've felt the exact same way. However, asking her to leave when she'd done nothing wrong and had been nice is not fair. It sounds like you're jealous of Zoe and the attention she was getting, and while I can empathize with that, it's not fair to punish her.", "YTA - you let your jealousy get control over the rest of your emotions and threat Zoe as plague, even if she didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe good thing is that you know she didn't do anything wrong, so at some level, you understand that the way you behave was not nice.\n\nYou are young, I'll suggest talking to a professional to work on your self-esteem and how to handle your emotions to dont repeat this kind of situation in the future.\nAlso try to apologize with Zoe and Josh, because what you said to her was more a reflection of your insecurity than whatever Zoe did during the party.", "YTA, not even close", "YTA. Your child is still at a young enough age that they won\u2019t remember who came to this birthday, and it seems mostly adults gathering. You and Josh are split up amicably and he is one of the rare young fathers who is pulling his parenting weight. Zoe went out of her way to be kind to you and it isn\u2019t her fault that people are excited to see her after a ling absence. The situation sucks but it wasn\u2019t like she intentionally showed up to steal focus. \n\nIt also sounds as though Zoe may end up being your child\u2019s step-mother so if you and Josh continue co-parenting she is going to be in the picture and  creating a tense relationship from the beginning is going to make parenting with her very difficult and possibly lead to problems your child will pick up on. That is unhealthy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want potential tensions and problems for years to come then you need to apologize asap and maybe take her out for some one on one time together to explain woman to woman that you understand it wasn\u2019t her fault or intention to steal focus at the bday party and why it was a final straw after hearing nonstop from literally everyone who never really gave you much of a chance with Josh while ypu were together that Zoe is like so totally awesome and perfect for him made you temporarily crazy and that you appreciate how she actually is incredibly sweet and inclusive of you and ask for forgiveness and another shot.", "YTA. That was so rude of you. She asked you a civil question; you could have told her you felt the attention was more on her than on your daughter. Instead you were nasty to her.", "YTA.  It's time to grow up.", "YTA- You we\u2019re rude to this girl out of jealousy. The fact that you mentioned how pretty she is more than once is evidence of this. She was not being rude when she came to the party. Her friends were excited to see her. His father was excited to meet her. \n\nYour anger at her is because her friendship with your daughter\u2019s father was threatening to your relationship and you are still holding that grudge. I can understand it, but that doesn\u2019t make you any less of an AH.", "YTA\nThat just made you look petty and jealous. Your daughter is 1. She had no feelings of being undermined at her birthday party, you just projected them. Your parents sound like they\u2019re childish if they think you come out of this looking good.", "NTA\n\nIt was a birthday party for your daughter, not a welcome home party for Zoe.", "ESH\n\nYou were incredibly rude to her for no apparent reason. You cannot possibly hold her accountable for how others distribute their attention. She wasn\u2019t dancing or tables or trying to make a TikTok. She was just being nice and mingling.\n\nAt the same time, others\u2019 reaction to her presence make me think that her and your ex haven\u2019t presented as a couple to his parents before the party. Parties, weddings, funerals, baptisms and so forth aren\u2019t appropriate places to make big life announcements so they were socially gauche for that.\n\nStill, your behavior was over the top.", "YTA. She didn't actually do anything to deserve to be sent away. It's not crazy for people to talk about someone among them who has just moved back.\n\nAre there some unresolved feelings or issues towards your ex? If so, it sounds like it would be good to give those things a place to be able to co-parent well.

Your opening part gives it away. You\u2019re immature. Grow up. You\u2019re a parent, act like it. You made your daughters birthday about your feelings and blamed them on someone who really did nothing wrong. Your jealousy ruined your own relationship with the father and now that the father is happier without you, you\u2019re bitter. Look at yourself and ask yourself \u201cwhy is he happier without me?\u201d You\u2019re a miserable person who brings others down around you. He got out and is better for it.

Had you pulled her aside and politely said \"hey I get that everyone is excited that you're here, but this party is for my daughter and it would mean a lot to me if you could help me shift the focus to her for this event.\" The focus should be your daughter. Not you, not blame on her, just the kid. Making her enemy #1 over a guy it doesn't sound like you even want, is only going to put your daughter in the middle. I get that it's a soft spot for you, but the truth of the matter is that even if Zoe is his *\"perfect match\"* or whatever, it is not because she is better than you. It is because they are more compatible with one another. Its not a competition. You also deserve a perfect match, not someone who makes you feel like you'll never really compare to the one that got away like Josh did when you were together \n\nYou could even tell her \"throughout my relationship with him, people constantly brought you up to the point it did become a factor in our breakup.

The hurt goes away and I'm sure you'll meet someone you just click with eventually. You're young you've got your whole life ahead of you. Just focus on being the best mom and role model for your daughter. I would say apologies are due to Zoe.

He\u2019s going to date other people, maybe even Zoe. He might even marry her. You\u2019re going to be with other people too.

She could be just as frustrated with all this pairing-up-talk as OP.   If it was written in the cards then I think it would have happened already.", ">No one compared OP to Zoe. And from the post no one said anything about her while OP and Josh were dating\u2026\n\nOPs comments say otherwise. Sounds like Josh never shut any of it down because it was bad enough that it was a large enough factor in their breakup.", "She would have to be pretty socially unaware to not realize that at someone else's celebration she was the ONLY subject to talk about.", "This, right here. The friend group kind of sucks on this one. OP was rude, but she may have never thought anything of it and Zoe may have never become an issue if not for their comments - and making them in her presence was also rude.", "Especially since being a teen mom is already hard enough when it comes to comparing your life to most people your age.", "That is why you have a party for family only.......let the friends go.", "It\u2019s supposed to be about the kid and the difference they have made to their parents lives. If the family honestly couldn\u2019t talk about the kid\u2019s milestones and how the kid was or wasn\u2019t like their parents as babies the focus could easily have been on how the parents are doing as parents. Are they a team? Has parenting come easily? What have been their inspirations as parents? How does the kid fit into the family (especially if it\u2019s the first grandchild.) Making the party about one guest is such a poor move and is a massive sign of being a shitty family.", "She said that her ex and Zoe talking on the phone was part of the reasoning for their break up, not that she was being compared to her.", "[removed]", "The friends were constantly telling the OP that she would have never had Josh if Zoe hadn't moved away and so on. That stuff adds up over time.", "I thought the OP was going to protest Josh bringing Zoe as the new GF and not wanting to have her there because Zoe and Josh hadn\u2019t been together very long. \nNot simple jealousy.

This conversation happens throughout the year.", "I think this would be a great idea", "Because having her friend group constantly compare her to Zoe and say repeatedly that she is only second best compared to Zoe is likely going to influence how she behaves.", "I am glad we can all stand back and criticize after the fact. I would have been upset too. A day for her daughter turns into Zoe day.\n\nShe may have reacted poorly but it is difficult when the crowd is gushing over Zoe......Zoe had the easy part since everyone adored her. It is so sad that poor OP is human and has feelings.", "She came to AITA and asked, she's not being dog piled by internet strangers: telling her whether she's in the wrong is the entire point of the sub, and the entire reason she's here", "I agree! While I do feel she was rude to Zoe, I personally think a special event for someone else is not the time to introduce a new partner", "And she has already gotten that judgement and figured it out, constantly going \u201cYTA OP!\u201d After they\u2019ve already realized it is just beating a dead horse.", "no, allude. they were right the first time. don't be that person.", "How embarrassing for you......", "She said even her friends were making comments about Zoe.", "It's baffling me anyone is saying Y T A. It is so obviously NTA. Throughout the whole relationship everyone makes OP aware that she is just some sort of replacement for Zoe and not good enough for Josh, making her feel like utter shit. The boyfriend was also sucky for never stopping it or being friends with people who disrespected his gf and mother of his daughter. Why did Josh even have a baby with someone he didn't completely love? That's a traumatizing relationship. Now OP is raising a 1 year old and she's only 18, she must be super stressed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen Zoe comes in and she easily could have said no to the party, but she didn't take social cues and said yes, which in my mind, was selfish. Seems like she wanted to be the center of attention. Everyone fawns over her the whole time when the party is not for her and it must have made OP feel terrible. Josh's ex-gf was right there and his friends should have had the courtesy to not lose their panties over Zoe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen Zoe tries to talk to OP and doesn't drop it when OP says \"mhmm\". She didn't even say anything rude, just didn't want to talk. Zoe should have taken the hint and left. Instead she pushes for OP to say something and yes what OP said is rude but cut her some slack. She's just a kid. She just had someone make the whole day about her ex's current partner (sort of). Who knows how much Josh even contributes to parenting. I won't make assumptions about him but if he was in love with Zoe this whole time, shouldn't have dated OP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe source for her breakup with the father of her child is at her party. She was gracious to even invite her. And she was nice to her the whole time til she reached a breaking point. I would also be hella jealous of Zoe if all this went down on a day meant for me and my kid, and I'm not a jealous person at all 99% of the time. Parenting is new for her and she's doing her best. People are being awfully harsh. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was rude because she was put in an unfair position and her hormones may still be all over the place (that happens for some mothers for years on end), she shouldn't be expected to be super graceful and kind 24/7. I understand why she snapped. And Zoe telling Josh, then subsequently everyone else at the party that OP was rude is a dick move. I would have understood she's just struggling and would have talked it out with her privately, not blasted her in front of friends and family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTBH Zoe knew what she was doing. OP's not that bad of a person and they already acknowledged their fault in this situation because the comment was unnecessary yes, but it does not make them an asshole. Everyone else but Zoe and OP were assholes if you ask me. They should have thrown a separate welcome back party for Zoe that does not fall on the same day as the daughter's very important milestone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCalling OP a bitch was also too rude of Zoe but no one is pointing that out. It must be exhausting being compared to someone else for the duration of your entire relationship, and after, and feeling like you'll never fill the shoes of your partner's ex. It was a lot to deal with for her and I get it. There is no asshole here between Zoe and OP (unless Zoe did do it on purpose but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt).", "Nta\nThat whole situation is weird af", "Nta the attention should have been on the baby and you did not HAVE to invite her assuming she was at your house or your parents she has no right to be there if she is unwelcome next time do not invite her if it's at your or your parents house she needs to accept she ain't welcome.", "ESH\n\nEverybody in this situation severely lacks empathy. You misdirected your anger towards Zoe, even though it wasn't technically her fault for getting all of that attention. However, Zoe should have read the room and at least try to redirect the attention towards your daughter.\n\nAlso it probably wasn't a great idea to have this huge gathering for your daughter's birthday in the first place.

I do think you went about the situation wrong cause you were very frustrated. I would see if it was me if you could apologize to Zoe cause it's not her fault, but explain your side to her of why it came out that way. Big hugs sweety you got this hold your head up.

Even though I totally understand where you're coming from, it's not an excuse to be as rude as you were to her. Jealousy is a bitch, I know. But you seem to be aware that you were in the wrong here which is great. Now you just need to figure out how to feel that jealousy, but not let it affect you. You also need to apologize to Zoe. She may end up being your kid's stepmom one day, hard as that may be to hear. But starting off on the wrong foot like this will only make co-parenting harder for everyone.

It sucks.", "YTA - you basically invited her... you kinda obliged yourself to be cordial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Josh asked if Zoe could be there too\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I was going to say no but I technically had no reason to.", "ESH.

Then, explain how the birthday really should've been about the birthday girl and not about Zoe's comeback, and that there could've been a more appropriate time for that.", "Soft YTA\n\nI understand it's hard because everyone (Josh, his friends, maybe his family) made you feel you were a shadow trying to fill in a larger than life space.

You can apologize to her but I would stay your distance from her (for your sake more than hers). I would also suggest to maybe have custody arrangements through a third-party/court, because if you don't want to be buddy buddy with your ex and his friends (and Zoe as she has returned), it might be easier to let yourself have breathing room. \n\nDon't let them make you feel less.

But it sounds like this girl will be part of your life. It\u2019s okay to set boundaries.", "Perhaps you need to find some more supportive friends, also does it matter what Josh\u2019s friends think? If it does, why does it matter to you, do you still want to be with Josh?", "Everyone is a little immature at 18, but as long as you know yta, it's a good chance to show some maturity and apologize. She didn't really do anything to you, and you're feeling jealous, but your jealousy doesn't justify taking internal feelings out on her. \n\nYou need to decide whether you're going to work on reconnecting with Josh or accepting that they will get together, since that seems to be the worst case scenario to you. Once you accept that's a possible reality, you can look at anything else as A-Ok.", "Mad respect to you for being self-aware enough to admit this. That\u2019s a big thing. Maybe you can contact Zoe and let her know that you got caught up in the moment, but have had time to think it through and apologize. Good luck to you and just stay focused on your beautiful daughter.", "Hey OP, I agree that your actions were in poor taste and you should make amends.  However, you are young and dealing with some really adult shit.  What counts here is that you're capable of reflecting on your actions and figuring out your own stuff.  I know people in their 50s that can't do that.", "Honey no your ex though didn't physically cheat on you it sure sounds like he emotionally did and you picked up on that . And though you need to process since it now looks like she might be in his life she doesn't need to be in yours at all.", "Just focus on yourself and your daughter. You need to move on", "Ok but that\u2019s a you problem, not a her problem. You do get that, right? Zoe the human being had zero input or agency over what other people were saying about her in her absence. Zoe the person didn\u2019t actually do anything to you. Your ex and his friends are the ones who were actually saying and doing things that affected you, because of the Zoe memory that lived in their heads. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re *wrong* to feel frustrated, but be frustrated with the people who are actually being rude to you.", "yeah, but -- so? I mean, good for him, he found the right person, now you can find your right person. It sucks for your baby but the only way to make that right is to accept that Zoe is your ex's match. (for now. see below.)\n\nYou have to co-parent with your ex for your child's sake. So, it's rude that your ex allowed her to take over the whole party, and it sucked, but I don't know what else you expect from an 18 year old guy. He's being immature as well. \n\nAnd, I mean, Who knows what's going to happen. I certainly did not marry anyone I was dating at 18 - life is long and in 10 years Zoe might not even be in the picture. But you know who will be? Your ex. He is that baby's father. So you have to grow up fast, faster than him (because our fucked-up society allows men to be doofuses and barely be there for their kids), and learn how to put aside petty jealousy. \n\nDo not feel bad for being immature, OP. You're a baby yourself. So okay, you messed up one stupid party. To me, that's so understandable. So Josh sucks, Zoe had nothing to do with any of it, and you're the winner bc you get this beautiful daughter. Focus on her and on how you are ALSO PRETTY and just, you know. Give yourself a break. This is hard shit. Get a good support system. Your parents sound great.", "ESH, OP, except Zoe and your baby.  Having said that, I have compassion for you that I don\u2019t for your ex\u2019s assholish friends.", "I can understand where you\u2019re coming from.  Everyone singing Zoe\u2019s praises the whole time you were together with your ex. Then instead of the party being about your daughter, Zoe gets all the attention, that would have pissed me off too. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, you can always apologize, and move on. Maybe try and be low contact with her.", "I get it, you\u2019re heartbroken and doing your best to move on. You were the asshole in the situation but it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole in life. Apologize and move forward, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to be friends but set that example for your daughter and be the role model she needs.", "Perhaps you should privately reach out to her and offer an apology and an explanation as to why you acted like that. It sounds like you regret how you treated her in the moment.", "It's tough when people keep talking about Zoe and your ex, it can take a toll on one's confidence. You know Zoe didn't deserve the response she got from you. Maybe when you are in a comfortable state, contact Zoe and apologize to her.", "Honestly. Call her or ask to meet and tell her everything, how you feel. And apologize profusely. There's a chance this woman could be your Daughter's stepmom. Probably putting the cart before the horse here but either way she's going to be in your daughter's life. Swallow your pride and humble yourself, she will probably respect you for it and understand if she's such a good person that everyone thinks. It won't be humiliating I promise you will feel better after too.", "You're being insane", "Honestly, were it not for Zoe, I'd say ESH too", "I wouldn't say they CAUSED OP to act the way she did. She chose her own actions. The rest of them are irrelevant. OP needs to focus on Zoe and work things out with her. The most OP needs to do for the rest is maybe apologize for interrupting the party but it sounds like it was over at that point anyways... But it's the polite thing to do to extend an olive branch is something we have to do as adults sometimes.", "I know how it feels not being accepted by your partner\u2019s family and friends. The thing is if you be mean to someone they like so much you become the bad guy especially if that person did nothing wrong. I would apologize to Zoe and take it from there. Not in a bad way maybe go to therapy sometime just talking to someone about all the emotions you\u2019re going through helps. Also writing in a journal helps.", "You feel the way you feel! Don't give yourself a hard time over having feelings. You're overwhelmed right now. Just take a breath. \n\nThe reason it feels like you're jealous of Josh and Zoe when you're actually not into Josh is this: Josh still gets to be carefree. I think you're envious that he can move on easily. It's not as easy for a single mom. I think you're mourning your abrupt transition from girl to woman, which -- let me tell you -- is a difficult transition even when you do it at 35. It's natural to feel weird about it.\n\nIt's also natural to feel threatened by a woman who's, you know, maybe a stepmom? Your baby's father's new *amour*? But my mom always said that my older sisters' stepmom was just another person to love them. If Zoe stays in Josh's life, she'll love your baby, and you'll be co-parenting with her as well. \n\nThat is a lot of feelings to process. So when you ask \"how else to feel,\" the answer is ... there's so much. Just so much. I think you should write in a journal about it, process these feelings, and try to see a future where Josh is just Josh and your daughter is your amazing miracle. \n\nI'll tell you a secret, after I had my first kid I low-key wished my husband would just disappear so I could have her all to myself. I wasn't serious, kinda, I didn't want to leave him, there was nothing wrong between us -- I just felt like NOW I had my true love, lol. I don't know if that's a helpful reframing for you. It's just an idle thought I had.", "It kinda just sounds like you\u2019re surrounded by crappy people. Your friends and his friends comments get a slight pass because you\u2019re all so young, but your moms comment about her is unacceptable. Also what the hell are you supposed to be watching out for? Zoe possibly dating someone you have no claim on and being nice to your kid? Isn\u2019t that like the goal? Him to meet someone nice who will treat your daughter well and be easy to co-parent with eventually? Your mom was shit stirring and you need to watch out for that and realize when it\u2019s happening so you can ignore it. And the dudes dad giving her more attention could be for a million reasons and very few have anything to do with comparing her to yourself. She could just be introverted or dad could be a creep who the heck knows. Ignore it and don\u2019t let it get to you.", "Real talk. She just doesn\u2019t matter, your kid does. Ignore her and the high school drama.\n\nYou will come out on top that way and you will have learned what adults learn. That none of that shit matters and that only high schoolers get jealous of other people like that.", "> I\u2019ve always sort of been under her shadow\n\nThis has only ever existed in your brain, and you're getting mad at everyone about it for no real reason.\n\n>I just don\u2019t know how else to feel about it.\n\nNot care", "Family?", "Exactly poor babies haven\u2019t learned yet!!!", "Yeah they are all really young and their parents aren't helping much. Dad's parents have been cold to OP which really isn't cool to the mother of your granddaughter regardless of the circumstances. OP's is giving well intentioned but toxic advice that isn't helping. It's a mess. But I think that OP has a good head on her shoulders and the situation is salvageable.  \n  \nI HATE it when women are pitted against each other. It's so unnecessary. The world attacks us and makes things difficult all without the extra nonsense. Imo even if I don't particularly like or love a girl's personality if she's my coworker or otherwise in my extended circle I make an extra effort to befriend women. It honestly really helped my social anxiety I had as a teen.  \n  \nDoesn't mean I agree with them all the time or keep toxic people but most people are fine in small doses especially. Having more female allies is always good, especially as a mother.", "Part of being an adult is the horror of realizing our parents can be huge dumbasses sometimes lol. A lot of folks in their generation have unhealthy attitudes and straight up bad advice. She should have said something like \"I'm sorry honey, it probably doesn't feel good to see everyone act this way over this Zoe girl. But maybe she'd be a really nice friend to have, so go introduce yourself. And give me a hug.\"  \n  \nAnd holy fuck I remember being 18 and I had very low self esteem when I really shouldn't have. I actually sought out counseling (free at the university I went to) because I was feeling so insecure in my relationship it was ruining it. My therapist was perceptive enough to the root problem, low self esteem. And it touched a lot more areas of my life than just my romantic relationships.   \n  \nOnce my therapist worked with me to tackle my self esteem (and honestly it was much easier than I thought it would be) it was like I was free. And the past 10 years since then have been (socially) better and easier than all of my teen years combined. So don't discount the benefits of a little professional help. Especially because you are a mother. Think about how you felt when your mom said that toxic shit to you. You don't want to end up doing the same to your daughter even once.", "She really didn\u2019t OP.    Seems like she thinks you and Josh are more than just co-parents.", "Oh. I said earlier that your parents sound great. I retract that statement. Clearly your mom is not the best advice-giver for you. Damn, I hate that you have to suddenly grow up to be more mature than your own mom.", "Touch\u00e9", "I agree OP chose her own actions, but. She's 18, a new mum and is in a stressful situation. It doesn't *excuse* her actions, but this is one of those things where it's not exactly out of the blue, either. People make mistakes, she made a mistake and she's responding really maturely. I think Josh and their friends *did* build some of this situation, even if they maybe didn't mean to. Everybody knows it's kind of a misogynistic dick move to compare the current girlfriend to the 'one that got away' though.", "THIS is really good advice.", "I think she didn't share enough. Obviously shouldn't have done it at the party but she should be honest and candid with Zoe and how everyone thirsts over her, and her own jealousy. These kinds of conversations and connections are very cathartic and even if Zoe tells OP to pound sand it would be better than just leaving things the way they are. Imo. You're right that Zoe absolutely isn't the one she should be mad at and if she snapped at anyone at the party it should have been the other friends.", "So basically, everyone except for Zoe (and OPs parents) are the assholes", "OP sounds more obsessed with Zoe than anyone else in this story. There's every chance they just mentioned her in passing and OP hangs onto any mention of her.", "This is a good way to move forward, OP", "If you come to a birthday party for a 1yr old the entire time you are there is how long you should fawn over said child.", "Agreed. I'm really hoping both OP and Zoe don't do the whole pitting women against each other trope and end up much better friends than everyone else. Especially if Zoe is actually interested in the baby daddy she actually has vested interest in getting the scoop straight from the horse's mouth so to speak. But she may be too young/immature to realize it. I hope not.", "Agree! OP came here looking for help and guidance, not a pie in the face.", "Yeah, the party is for the mother - and in most circumstances, expecting to remain the center of attention would be unrealistic and nothing to blow up over when it doesn\u2019t happen.  \n\nBut OP is 18.  She had her daughter at 17.  So in this particular scenario?  Fuck yeah she deserves a party for having kept her offspring alive and healthy for a year. And she\u2019s still on amicable terms with her ex and his family?  That\u2019s an accomplishment.  \n\nSo here she is at the normal milestone type event that she\u2019s able to provide for her daughter,  baby presumably all photo-ready, and ready herself to be rightly congratulated on how well she\u2019s doing and how her daughter is just the cutest, cleverest, most well-adjusted baby ever - \n\nAnd here are all these people fussing over this other young woman who they think is perfect for her ex.  Unlike her, the mother of his child.  The child who is meant to be the focus of this party, and who everybody seems to think only exists because Zoe moved away.  Everybody thinks Josh and Zoe are meant to be - which makes OP and her daughter what?  A side-quest?  \n\nIs any of this Zoe\u2019s fault, no.  Is it understandable that OP lost it a bit?  It really is.", ">No, the party is for the MOTHER. The baby doesn't give a crap.\n\nTHAT PART. These parties are always for the parents more than the kids.", "And doesn\u2019t happen at parties celebrating the child\u2019s life? Bit of a stretch there. Or do you focus on the birthday person more as they get older? Grandparents get loads of convo about them and parents get a lot of time whereas children get attention for the song and a minute or two after?", "You're an angry person. You should maybe look at her age and what she's dealing with and not go so aggro on her for a mistake that any teenager would make.", "That makes it even worse though. Everyone talking about her replacement the entire party.", "Miss me with that. We are talking about a parent. Grown choices mean grown behavior. And aggro? Really? She came here for judgement. I gave mine. Feel free to vote however you choose."]}
