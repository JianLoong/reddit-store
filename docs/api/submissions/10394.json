It's really hard.  And then everyone at your child's b'day paid a lot of attention to a very pretty girl who might end up with your child's dad.  And you were so jealous you couldn't stand it, and you were very rude and mean to her.\n\nStop.  Take a breath.  You can fix this.  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to own up to it and apologize to Zoe.  You have to be absolutely sincere and mean it.  Let her know that you see how nice she is, and you appreciate how sweet she is to you and to your baby.  Let her know that she's welcome and you'll never treat her like that again.  Especially if she's going to end up with Josh, who you describe as a very good father, you want a good relationship with her if only for your daughter's sake.\n\nThen you need to apologize to Josh.\n\nFinally, you're a mom.  It's important for you to start modeling the kind of behavior you want your daughter to grow up with (even if at 1 year old she doesn't get it, start now!).", "YTA\nShe did NOTHING to you. You were unforgivably rude to her, for reasons that are purely internal.", "YTA, and you're letting your jealousy show. Of course people are going to be more interested in an adult who they've heard a lot about vs a little kids birthday", "I understand why you were annoyed but YTA. She didn't do anything wrong. She even stayed back and talked to you. You might have some lingering feelings or you are jealous but thats not on her. Even if you don't have any feelings, still she didn't pull a stunt to grab attention.

You seem to be very jealous. She was just recently back and a lot of people hadn't spoken to her in a long time. Of course, they want to talk to her much. It also doesn't sound like your daughter was unhappy at her party. So the only person with a problem here are you.", "ESH. \n\nIt would have been amazing if you had the grace to endure that party and express your feelings later.

And if her and Josh never did anything together while you were dating and it just all came from his friends and your friends then the friends are assholes. I understand your emotions.

I totally understand that she would make it uncomfortable for you in that case. And that\u2019s OK. But don\u2019t take it out on her. Realize that those are your emotions.", "YTA - your daughter is 1\n\nWhat did you expect a party for her to be like? Of course the adults were going to focus on other adults, a 1 year old isn\u2019t exactly a party animal \n\nIt\u2019s not Zoe\u2019s fault everyone focused on her, she was being nice to you and your daughter and you were rude to her for no reason", "ESH. Yea you weren\u2019t nice, but I feel like everyone is missing that this was supposed to be your daughter\u2019s birthday party and it turned into a party for this girl.

Sounds like you're jealous or not as over Josh as you thought. You had a child very young and that means you need to grow up fast and put your child first so she feels comfortable with both parents.", "YTA. I get how you feel and all, I would've felt the exact same way. However, asking her to leave when she'd done nothing wrong and had been nice is not fair. It sounds like you're jealous of Zoe and the attention she was getting, and while I can empathize with that, it's not fair to punish her.", "YTA - you let your jealousy get control over the rest of your emotions and threat Zoe as plague, even if she didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe good thing is that you know she didn't do anything wrong, so at some level, you understand that the way you behave was not nice.\n\nYou are young, I'll suggest talking to a professional to work on your self-esteem and how to handle your emotions to dont repeat this kind of situation in the future.\nAlso try to apologize with Zoe and Josh, because what you said to her was more a reflection of your insecurity than whatever Zoe did during the party.", "YTA, not even close", "YTA. Your child is still at a young enough age that they won\u2019t remember who came to this birthday, and it seems mostly adults gathering. You and Josh are split up amicably and he is one of the rare young fathers who is pulling his parenting weight. Zoe went out of her way to be kind to you and it isn\u2019t her fault that people are excited to see her after a ling absence. The situation sucks but it wasn\u2019t like she intentionally showed up to steal focus. \n\nIt also sounds as though Zoe may end up being your child\u2019s step-mother so if you and Josh continue co-parenting she is going to be in the picture and  creating a tense relationship from the beginning is going to make parenting with her very difficult and possibly lead to problems your child will pick up on. That is unhealthy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want potential tensions and problems for years to come then you need to apologize asap and maybe take her out for some one on one time together to explain woman to woman that you understand it wasn\u2019t her fault or intention to steal focus at the bday party and why it was a final straw after hearing nonstop from literally everyone who never really gave you much of a chance with Josh while ypu were together that Zoe is like so totally awesome and perfect for him made you temporarily crazy and that you appreciate how she actually is incredibly sweet and inclusive of you and ask for forgiveness and another shot.", "YTA. That was so rude of you. She asked you a civil question; you could have told her you felt the attention was more on her than on your daughter. Instead you were nasty to her.", "YTA.  It's time to grow up.", "YTA- You we\u2019re rude to this girl out of jealousy. The fact that you mentioned how pretty she is more than once is evidence of this. She was not being rude when she came to the party. Her friends were excited to see her. His father was excited to meet her. \n\nYour anger at her is because her friendship with your daughter\u2019s father was threatening to your relationship and you are still holding that grudge. I can understand it, but that doesn\u2019t make you any less of an AH.", "YTA\nThat just made you look petty and jealous. Your daughter is 1. She had no feelings of being undermined at her birthday party, you just projected them. Your parents sound like they\u2019re childish if they think you come out of this looking good.", "NTA\n\nIt was a birthday party for your daughter, not a welcome home party for Zoe.", "ESH\n\nYou were incredibly rude to her for no apparent reason. You cannot possibly hold her accountable for how others distribute their attention. She wasn\u2019t dancing or tables or trying to make a TikTok. She was just being nice and mingling.\n\nAt the same time, others\u2019 reaction to her presence make me think that her and your ex haven\u2019t presented as a couple to his parents before the party. Parties, weddings, funerals, baptisms and so forth aren\u2019t appropriate places to make big life announcements so they were socially gauche for that.\n\nStill, your behavior was over the top.", "YTA. She didn't actually do anything to deserve to be sent away. It's not crazy for people to talk about someone among them who has just moved back.\n\nAre there some unresolved feelings or issues towards your ex? If so, it sounds like it would be good to give those things a place to be able to co-parent well.

Not like you.  YTA", "\"Nothing ever happened but you know\"\n\nNo, no we do not. Know why? Because two human beings can talk to each other and be friends while having different genitals, and it not be a sexual/romantic relationship.

Your opening part gives it away. You\u2019re immature. Grow up. You\u2019re a parent, act like it. You made your daughters birthday about your feelings and blamed them on someone who really did nothing wrong. Your jealousy ruined your own relationship with the father and now that the father is happier without you, you\u2019re bitter. Look at yourself and ask yourself \u201cwhy is he happier without me?\u201d You\u2019re a miserable person who brings others down around you. He got out and is better for it.

Had you pulled her aside and politely said \"hey I get that everyone is excited that you're here, but this party is for my daughter and it would mean a lot to me if you could help me shift the focus to her for this event.\" The focus should be your daughter. Not you, not blame on her, just the kid. Making her enemy #1 over a guy it doesn't sound like you even want, is only going to put your daughter in the middle. I get that it's a soft spot for you, but the truth of the matter is that even if Zoe is his *\"perfect match\"* or whatever, it is not because she is better than you. It is because they are more compatible with one another. Its not a competition. You also deserve a perfect match, not someone who makes you feel like you'll never really compare to the one that got away like Josh did when you were together \n\nYou could even tell her \"throughout my relationship with him, people constantly brought you up to the point it did become a factor in our breakup.

Since you are going to be in his life and that means in my daughter's life, I am going to try to work through that but I just wanted you to know *why* this is difficult for me.\" You should apologize, explain where you're coming from, and tell her that you will be working on it", "If she is going to be around, and around your daughter, I would advise you to send her a message simply explaining all of how you feel.

The hurt goes away and I'm sure you'll meet someone you just click with eventually. You're young you've got your whole life ahead of you. Just focus on being the best mom and role model for your daughter. I would say apologies are due to Zoe.

He\u2019s going to date other people, maybe even Zoe. He might even marry her. You\u2019re going to be with other people too.

If she's a miserable person you're just as bad.", "This sounds really hard.  Watching your ex move on is no fun, but you will need to accept it and find people who love and support you.  On the bright side, another adult to care for and about your daughter could be helpful to you; if Josh is happy, that\u2019s good for you too.  And you\u2019re still young\u2026 Zoe may seem awesome but anything could happen with her and Josh . It won\u2019t be all smooth sailing for any of you.  Take the high road!", "Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Yeah you were an AH but you\u2019re very young and given the situation it\u2019s understandable. When people like this come along in life just be neutral to their face and talk shit with your bff or mom. For what it\u2019s worth if she\u2019s not dating your ex I\u2019m not sure why she needed to be at your daughter\u2019s birthday party and that would annoy tf out of me too.", "It\u2019s understandable to feel jealousy or envy or whatever. *Acting* the way you did was not okay. But the best thing to take out of this situation is that you *know* you were in the wrong, you can admit it, and you can improve yourself in the future.", "Yeah, you are.", "I would recommend you contact Zoe to apologize, and explain these feelings to her - not to justify your behaviour, but to provide her with the context. Then tell her that you know, rationally, that none of this can be laid at her door and that you hope she understands and can forgive you. Why do I suggest this? Because if she and your ex do end up seeing each other, your baby will as well, and you may want to get the relationship on an even keel before that happens. Good luck!", "Does your mom often make comments like that? Cos that\u2019ll not be helping matters at all. \n\nI wonder if it could be a lack of confidence in yourself, and maybe that\u2019s what people (Josh\u2019s friends and Dad) are picking up on, and maybe why you think they don\u2019t like you? Just a thought. \n\nYou\u2019re still learning, you\u2019re so young and have a lot going on in your life! Maybe apologise to Zoe but I think you got this OP. All the best :)", "Why in the fuck are people downvoting this? The OP is actually being reflective here, give her some damn space.", "When teenagers make adult decisions like having kids then they need to be held accountable like adults. They don\u2019t get to keep acting like teenagers or be held accountable like a teenager.", "It would have helped if her entire friend group didn\u2019t compare the OP to Zoe so much.", "This is kinda weird.", "Their brains aren't finished developing and they don't have the extra decade of experience to make them mature like a parent ought to be. Yeah, they shouldn't have had a kid so young, but what good does saying it now do them? They can't un-have her, they clearly love her and care for her well. The issue at hand is relationship bs, and don't try to tell me for a second that adults in their 30s don't behave just as badly when relationship bs happens. All you need is ten minutes in this exact sub to show you that. I hope you aren't a parent, and if you are I feel sorry for your children. Try having a small dose of empathy for people sometime. It's good for you.", "And regardless of what the friend group did, that doesn't justify behaving badly against the woman. That woman isn't responsible for the friend group's behavior", "She can't control the behavior of others. Only her own.", "Your mom sucks for fueling your insecurities.", "True. But it bothered her and her mother enough to make it an issue, and I don't think at any point OP notes that during their relationship he shut anyone down about the Zoe comments, which was an issue on his part. It was chronic enough to be a factor in their breakup, so Josh should be aware that its an issue and do something about it\n\nOP was definitely in the wrong with how it was handled, but reoccurring points of contention are often the responsibility of multiple parties mishandling components that contribute to the whole issue. I don't think OP should feel like she and her daughter are second place for their event, there's a time and a place to welcome Zoe and its unfortunate it was at a child's party rather than its own thing if it was going to be a big deal\n\nI doubt Zoe was expecting any of this based off how she handled things, and may not know she was cause for insecurity in their relationship so she wouldn't have known to dial things down", "Making excuses for shitty behavior and using this thread as a way to justify it? What world do you live on? Shitty people with shitty behavior getting called out for it is what\u2019s commonly known as accountability. Lmfao. If anything you more so or less supported my stance by stating whether they\u2019re teenagers or adults people will always make stupid decisions like this. They need called out and made aware of their shitty behavior.", "I never said it did, why not respond to what I did say?", "I never said she could.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like Zoe was dialing anything up in the first place. She has zero responsibility to correct party goers. \n\nWhat did you want this girl to do, ask people to please stop talking about her and pay attention to the ex of her boyfriend? I sure hope that isn\u2019t what you are insinuating. Real life doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nPerhaps you meant Josh, that he should correct the attention. More reasonable, but then it would also then be more reasonable to suggest that the OP have her discussion with Josh, and not call out Zoe.\n\nEither way, the OP did not act correctly at all.", "I think you need to see a therapist.", "What you did say isn't related to OP's being TA. At best, it sounds like a justification for OP's behavior.", "Then why is the behavior of the friend group being brought up? This is about OP's behavior. Zoe's behavior is the only other relevant behavior to look at. And her behavior was fine.", "Oh I absolutely agree, I doubt Zoe had any idea OP was uncomfortable with the focus being on her. That being said, if I were Zoe and OP pulled me aside and said something like my original comment I would be more than happy to acknowledge everyone's attention and redirect to the daughter/family central to the party\n\nI definitely agree OP was out of line, which is why I noted alternatives to making a scene or calling Zoe out for something she wasn't at any fault for", "You need a grip on reality and realize it\u2019s not sunshine and rainbows.", "It\u2019s just saying that *everyone* in this situation BUT Zoe sucked. OP didn\u2019t manage her emotions well, she was getting lowkey harassed by her friend group, and that\u2019s a bad mix. OP already said she knows she was in the wrong, what\u2019s the point in saying that she was? She already knows.", "Life is what we make it. People like you choose to make it worse. I won't be doing that \ud83d\ude0a have a nice rest of your day, dude. I hope you get help."]}
