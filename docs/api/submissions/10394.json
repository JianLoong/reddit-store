Apparently Zoe and Josh never dated but everyone insists that they would\u2019ve had she not moved away. One of the first things Josh\u2019s friends said to him when we broke up was \u201cyou should call Zoe up!\u201d I\u2019ve heard plenty of how perfect they are for each other. She\u2019s super pretty too.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, she was another reason we broke up. Even though she moved hours and hours away, her and Josh would still talk. Nothing ever happened but you know. \n\nWell she moved back into the area some weeks ago and I haven\u2019t seen Josh this happy in a long time. Our daughter\u2019s birthday was soon and we agreed on doing birthdays together and Josh asked if Zoe could be there too since all of our friends were coming anyways. \n\nI was going to say no but I technically had no reason to. She\u2018s been super nice to me and our daughter and it\u2019s not like Josh and I are together anymore. \n\nShe came and everyone\u2019s attention was on her. Many of them hadn\u2019t seen her in years and well like I said, she\u2019s very pretty. My daughter obviously didn\u2019t care but I felt that everyone was being a bit rude. Even Josh\u2019s dad was like \u201cwait... you\u2019re THE Zoe?!\u201d And talked to her for ages saying how glad he was to finally meet her. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, everyone was super sweet to my daughter and my daughter really likes Zoe.

Everyone went out to the backyard and Josh had our daughter. Zoe stayed behind for whatever reason.\n\nShe started telling me how cute my daughter is.

I told her that her whole presence offends me and that I\u2019m tired of hearing about her all the time. I then asked her to please leave. \n\nI heard her call me a bitch but she just quickly whispered something to Josh then left.

It's really hard.  And then everyone at your child's b'day paid a lot of attention to a very pretty girl who might end up with your child's dad.  And you were so jealous you couldn't stand it, and you were very rude and mean to her.\n\nStop.  Take a breath.  You can fix this.  \n\nThe first thing you need to do is to own up to it and apologize to Zoe.  You have to be absolutely sincere and mean it.  Let her know that you see how nice she is, and you appreciate how sweet she is to you and to your baby.  Let her know that she's welcome and you'll never treat her like that again.  Especially if she's going to end up with Josh, who you describe as a very good father, you want a good relationship with her if only for your daughter's sake.\n\nThen you need to apologize to Josh.\n\nFinally, you're a mom.  It's important for you to start modeling the kind of behavior you want your daughter to grow up with (even if at 1 year old she doesn't get it, start now!).", "YTA\nShe did NOTHING to you. You were unforgivably rude to her, for reasons that are purely internal.", "YTA, and you're letting your jealousy show. Of course people are going to be more interested in an adult who they've heard a lot about vs a little kids birthday", "I understand why you were annoyed but YTA. She didn't do anything wrong. She even stayed back and talked to you. You might have some lingering feelings or you are jealous but thats not on her. Even if you don't have any feelings, still she didn't pull a stunt to grab attention. It must feel bad to not have all the attention on the birthday girl but your reaction was inappropriate still.", "YTA. \n\nDefinitely sounds like you were insecure/jealous. \n\nDon\u2019t take it out on her.", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA, don\u2019t be a mean girl she did nothing to you.", "Yes YTA. You are going to have to get used to this man having other people in his life. You are both so so young. Best of luck to you.", "YTA, she had done nothing wrong, her mere presence is not offensive, other people's reactions are what upset you and you took it out on the wrong person.\n\nIt looks like she's probably going to be around a lot more now she's moved back into the area so better get used to it, you've made a terrible start at it so far.", "YTA. You seem to be very jealous. She was just recently back and a lot of people hadn't spoken to her in a long time. Of course, they want to talk to her much. It also doesn't sound like your daughter was unhappy at her party. So the only person with a problem here are you.", "ESH. \n\nIt would have been amazing if you had the grace to endure that party and express your feelings later. Your mom sucks for fueling your insecurities. \n\nEveryone else sucks for letting your daughter's b-day party turn into the \"Welcome Back, Zoe!\" event.", "YTA\nit\u2019s not her fault. And if her and Josh never did anything together while you were dating and it just all came from his friends and your friends then the friends are assholes. I understand your emotions. But I think you\u2019re channeling them towards the wrong person. It sounds like you still have some healing to do. I still need to get over things. I totally understand that she would make it uncomfortable for you in that case. And that\u2019s OK. But don\u2019t take it out on her. Realize that those are your emotions.", "YTA - your daughter is 1\n\nWhat did you expect a party for her to be like? Of course the adults were going to focus on other adults, a 1 year old isn\u2019t exactly a party animal \n\nIt\u2019s not Zoe\u2019s fault everyone focused on her, she was being nice to you and your daughter and you were rude to her for no reason", "ESH. Yea you weren\u2019t nice, but I feel like everyone is missing that this was supposed to be your daughter\u2019s birthday party and it turned into a party for this girl. I would\u2019ve just asked him to take care of the baby til the party was over and excused myself.", ">but I felt that everyone was being a bit rude.\n\n>But she was the main topic the WHOLE time.\n\n>My mom noticed this too and kept trying to turn the attention to my daughter. \n\n>When she gave up, I got really upset.\n\n>wasn\u2019t in the mood though so I just replied with mhms.

People hadn't seen her in awhile and were happy to talk to her.\n\nYour 1 year old won't care.\n\nGet over yourself.\n\nYTA", "YTA. That was very rude of you. Sounds like you're jealous or not as over Josh as you thought. You had a child very young and that means you need to grow up fast and put your child first so she feels comfortable with both parents.", "YTA. I get how you feel and all, I would've felt the exact same way. However, asking her to leave when she'd done nothing wrong and had been nice is not fair. It sounds like you're jealous of Zoe and the attention she was getting, and while I can empathize with that, it's not fair to punish her.", "YTA - you let your jealousy get control over the rest of your emotions and threat Zoe as plague, even if she didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThe good thing is that you know she didn't do anything wrong, so at some level, you understand that the way you behave was not nice.\n\nYou are young, I'll suggest talking to a professional to work on your self-esteem and how to handle your emotions to dont repeat this kind of situation in the future.\nAlso try to apologize with Zoe and Josh, because what you said to her was more a reflection of your insecurity than whatever Zoe did during the party.", "YTA, not even close", "YTA. Your child is still at a young enough age that they won\u2019t remember who came to this birthday, and it seems mostly adults gathering. You and Josh are split up amicably and he is one of the rare young fathers who is pulling his parenting weight. Zoe went out of her way to be kind to you and it isn\u2019t her fault that people are excited to see her after a ling absence. The situation sucks but it wasn\u2019t like she intentionally showed up to steal focus. \n\nIt also sounds as though Zoe may end up being your child\u2019s step-mother so if you and Josh continue co-parenting she is going to be in the picture and  creating a tense relationship from the beginning is going to make parenting with her very difficult and possibly lead to problems your child will pick up on. That is unhealthy.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want potential tensions and problems for years to come then you need to apologize asap and maybe take her out for some one on one time together to explain woman to woman that you understand it wasn\u2019t her fault or intention to steal focus at the bday party and why it was a final straw after hearing nonstop from literally everyone who never really gave you much of a chance with Josh while ypu were together that Zoe is like so totally awesome and perfect for him made you temporarily crazy and that you appreciate how she actually is incredibly sweet and inclusive of you and ask for forgiveness and another shot.", "YTA. That was so rude of you. She asked you a civil question; you could have told her you felt the attention was more on her than on your daughter. Instead you were nasty to her.", "YTA.  It's time to grow up.", "YTA- You we\u2019re rude to this girl out of jealousy. The fact that you mentioned how pretty she is more than once is evidence of this. She was not being rude when she came to the party. Her friends were excited to see her. His father was excited to meet her. \n\nYour anger at her is because her friendship with your daughter\u2019s father was threatening to your relationship and you are still holding that grudge. I can understand it, but that doesn\u2019t make you any less of an AH.", "YTA\nThat just made you look petty and jealous. Your daughter is 1. She had no feelings of being undermined at her birthday party, you just projected them. Your parents sound like they\u2019re childish if they think you come out of this looking good.", "NTA\n\nIt was a birthday party for your daughter, not a welcome home party for Zoe.", "ESH\n\nYou were incredibly rude to her for no apparent reason. You cannot possibly hold her accountable for how others distribute their attention. She wasn\u2019t dancing or tables or trying to make a TikTok. She was just being nice and mingling.\n\nAt the same time, others\u2019 reaction to her presence make me think that her and your ex haven\u2019t presented as a couple to his parents before the party. Parties, weddings, funerals, baptisms and so forth aren\u2019t appropriate places to make big life announcements so they were socially gauche for that.\n\nStill, your behavior was over the top.", "YTA. She didn't actually do anything to deserve to be sent away. It's not crazy for people to talk about someone among them who has just moved back.\n\nAre there some unresolved feelings or issues towards your ex? If so, it sounds like it would be good to give those things a place to be able to co-parent well. If not, there could still be some reason why you felt like you had to act this way, it could be good to explore that.", "Maybe, just maybe, people adore her because she has a good heart.  Not like you.  YTA", "\"Nothing ever happened but you know\"\n\nNo, no we do not. Know why? Because two human beings can talk to each other and be friends while having different genitals, and it not be a sexual/romantic relationship. Go on, explain in clear detail what it is we should \"know\" about this without it sounding godawful. YTA.", "YTA. How could you write that out and expect anything different?", "YTA. Your opening part gives it away. You\u2019re immature. Grow up. You\u2019re a parent, act like it. You made your daughters birthday about your feelings and blamed them on someone who really did nothing wrong. Your jealousy ruined your own relationship with the father and now that the father is happier without you, you\u2019re bitter. Look at yourself and ask yourself \u201cwhy is he happier without me?\u201d You\u2019re a miserable person who brings others down around you. He got out and is better for it.

Until you find a way to move on from your past together, it will likely keep being a problem.", "It doesn't sound like *you* want to date Josh, so its not really your problem if she's his cosmic soul mate.\n\nWhen you share a child with someone, its your job to put your child first. Had you pulled her aside and politely said \"hey I get that everyone is excited that you're here, but this party is for my daughter and it would mean a lot to me if you could help me shift the focus to her for this event.\" The focus should be your daughter. Not you, not blame on her, just the kid. Making her enemy #1 over a guy it doesn't sound like you even want, is only going to put your daughter in the middle. I get that it's a soft spot for you, but the truth of the matter is that even if Zoe is his *\"perfect match\"* or whatever, it is not because she is better than you. It is because they are more compatible with one another. Its not a competition. You also deserve a perfect match, not someone who makes you feel like you'll never really compare to the one that got away like Josh did when you were together \n\nYou could even tell her \"throughout my relationship with him, people constantly brought you up to the point it did become a factor in our breakup. I understand that you had no part in making people say that, but it was still something that hurt me. Since you are going to be in his life and that means in my daughter's life, I am going to try to work through that but I just wanted you to know *why* this is difficult for me.\" You should apologize, explain where you're coming from, and tell her that you will be working on it", "If she is going to be around, and around your daughter, I would advise you to send her a message simply explaining all of how you feel.
