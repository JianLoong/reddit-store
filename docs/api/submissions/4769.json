We were visiting my family this week and were staying at my grandparents place, along with my parents and 2 siblings. \n\nFor context:\nPatrick has not been to their house before, but I showed him round the whole house when we arrived. \nThey have a pretty big house, two bathrooms upstairs, with another smaller bathroom downstairs. \n\nAnyway, while we were staying, there were a few times where Patrick and I would be doing our own thing in different parts of the house (watching TV, talking to relatives, napping, etc.). However I started to notice he would always come and find me when he needed the bathroom to check which one to use. I always said he could use any that are free. \n\nOne evening I was in the downstairs bathroom getting ready for bed and I got a text from him asking where I was, I said I was in the bathroom, he told me to hurry up because he needed me, I asked what for and he said he needed to go to the bathroom. I thought he meant to use the bathroom I was in so I asked if any of the others were free and he said he didn't know. I told him to go and check, but then he started angry messaging me saying he couldn't and I needed to help him. \n\nI just ignored him as he was being ridiculous and a grown man can go to the bathroom without his girlfriend helping him. \n\nWhen I got back to the bedroom he was still there and was really angry calling me the AH for leaving him in a house he didn't know when he needed the bathroom (he knows where the bathrooms are as he had used each of them at one point or another over the week). \n\nI feel like he's old enough to figure this stuff out himself and I shouldn't have to look after him like this, but at the same time he seemed really angry and upset, so AITA for not helping him find a bathroom?\n\nEdit: I did have a conversation with him after the first couple of times this happened and he said it wasn't anything to do with anxiety, he just needed to know which bathroom to use. I told him to stop asking then but he still got angry/upset.", "created_utc": 1671087140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmelye/aita_for_not_helping_my_boyfriend_go_to_the/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know anything special about the bathrooms. I don't know which bathroom is available at any point in time...the only way to tell is to walk to the bathroom, and knock if the door is closed. I find it perplexing that you keep asking me something that I have no special knowledge about. Is there something going on with you and the bathrooms?\"\n\nAnd if he says no, \"Then I'm going to need you to stop asking me questions about it. I'm happy to talk about it if you have a genuine issue, but otherwise, it's just frustrating.\"\n\nNTA.

Getting me to feel comfortable takes a lot of effort from me and luckily most people I've met where fine with it as I try to be sociable still). \n\nInfo: I guess it's the first time he meets your family?", "Nta but I am assuming something else is at play here.. I just cant imagine what", "NTA\n\nThis is odd behavior on his part. I feel like there\u2019s something else to this but I can\u2019t figure out what that would be. Does he act overly helpless in other situations?", "NTA.\n\nThere's just no circumstance in which an able-bodied,  competent adult needs their hand held to find the loo once they've been shown where it is.  It's  ridiculous that he got mad at you for not hurrying your own visit to the bathroom to....what? (Come make sure there aren't spiders ? Guard the door? Keep him company? Sing him the peepee song in case he has trouble getting started?)", "NTA \nIs he using this as code for you to sneak away and have sex? If so, he should tell you the code.", "NTA - you're absolutely right that he should've been able to manage that himself, however it seems your boyfriend has some anxiety issues, so maybe time for you and him to have a talk about that.", "NTA A grown able bodied man should be able to usd the bathroom by himself.", "NTA, but I think your boyfriend either isn\u2019t being honest about his anxiety or hasn\u2019t recognized that he is at least having some anxiety disturbing someone who is your family, in their home, in their bathroom, during a very vulnerable moment. He needs you to check to make sure it\u2019s safe because it\u2019s less embarrassing for him and he wants to make sure he leaves a good impression and leaves that house with your family singing praises about him.  \n\nOr at least, that\u2019s the impression I\u2019m getting off of this. Even if he isn\u2019t like this at home or with his family/friends, he has to be extra on his toes in order to make sure your family likes him and he doesn\u2019t do anything to embarrass himself. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if something like this has happened before!", "Info: does he have anxiety? While he knows the location of the washrooms I'm wondering if something deeper is behind his need to have you physically guide him to one\n\nEta: NTA, I just feel like there must be more to it than him just not wanting to search for a free washroom on his own", "Info: Does your BF have difficulty with directions, maps, geography, usually?", "NTA if he needs a bathroom that badly I\u2019m sure he will find one and not pee in the corner.

Stop catering to this nonsense.", "It is irrational, but feeling uncomfortable in a new place and around people you\u2019re not close with can be really strong. I\u2019ve done all sorts of weird things: I would wake up at 4-5am at camps to avoid a line to the shower. I\u2019d wait in my room with a full bladder or empty stomach when I heard someone in the corridor rather than risk contact while going to the bathroom/kitchen. I\u2019ve known my in-laws for over a year now and I feel super welcome and confortable in their house, and I\u2019ll still not make myself tea/a sandwich without them offering first, even though I\u2019m absolutely allowed to. I\u2019m now much more self-aware and I\u2019m doing MUCH better as an adult, but it used to be absolute hell, to the point of making me physically sick in the bowels.\n\nThere\u2019s probably something not entirely rational that makes Patrick uncomfortable, and you struggle to understand because it\u2019s your family home so it\u2019s natural for you to just use the bathroom when you need it.\n\nNAH because I get where he\u2019s coming from, but I also get how frustrating it has to be for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This sounds like sequel number 5 of meet the parents. Poor Pat.", "How can OP pick a bathroom for him without literally stopping what she is doing, getting up, walking to the bathroom and checking if it's available? And why should she since he is literally capable of doing every one of those actions? After all, it's not like he is a little kid\n\n>Maybe it's a kink\n\nIt's rude/creepy to involve others in your kink without their knowledge and consent. Even if the other person is your partner...you have an obligation to let them know what you are doing, not just harass them while they are literally in the bathroom, then be angry they didn't respond\n\nAnd your McD/BK analogy isn't great... You have a stake in the food you will be eating, even if you'd be happy with either. OP has *zero* stake in which bathroom he uses. A better analogy would be if your BF asked you which McDonald's *he* should go to for *his* lunch, the one on Main Street or the one on Elm Avenue\n\nNow, please excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. Which one should I use?", "On that case, he might be uncomfortable to knock and potentially disturb anyone on the toilet.", "It's possible he's developed it recently, or maybe he just didn't feel comfortable in the house. I know that I've been at someone's house and not comfortable which made me not want to leave the comfort of my friend/bf/whomever I was with and venture off on my own", "Anxiety was my first thought too.\n\nI have crippling bathroom anxiety. I literally cannot go at all if I think someone could be listening or judging me. Those may not be the best words, but just as an example, any time I've been to a hospital, even overnight,  I can't go to the bathroom unless someone I trust is outside preventing others from knocking. \n\nOnce was particularly bad, as the nurses didn't believe me and insisted on checking on me every 30 seconds, telling me to just hurry up and finish. I lied so they wouldn't cath me, but I wasn't able to go until I was home over a full 24 hours later. And that's not my worst experience. \n\nHomes are different but still weird because most people have an approximate usual time they use the bathroom/shower, and not knowing if someone is going to be urgently knocking in the next two minutes can be enough to make me uncomfortable, especially if I'm not familiar with the personalities of the people I'm with.\n\nMy issues stem from trauma, and I am working on them, but I've learned that they're not terribly uncommon. \n\nI think you handled the situation well. Honestly, I'm upfront with my issues to prevent this sort of thing, and I don't think it's fair for him to be upset for not giving him what he needs when he's not really communicating what that is.\n\nMy vote is a direct and honest conversation about what specifically he needs and some indication as to why so the issue can be better managed.", ">How can OP pick a bathroom for him without literally stopping what she is doing, getting up, walking to the bathroom and checking if it's available? And why should she since he is literally capable of doing every one of those actions?\n\nI think the checking if it's available is where the issue lies. I expect he thinks it would be really embarrassing to knock and find out grandpa/granny is currently using the bathroom. Whereas he doesn't think that would be embarrassing for his gf, as she's their family. \n\nI couldn't care less if I knock on the door, or even walk in, if my mum is in there. But I know my ex felt embarrassed whenever he felt like he'd interrupted her with a knock. And I would always do a quick headcount at his house (to make sure everyone was not in the bathroom) before I nipped to the loo at his parent's place.", "I wasn't suggesting that OP should take any particular action but genuinely asking why not just pick one. I was in no way condoning the boyfriend's behavior. Sorry you took such offense to someone having a question about your absolute. OP knows what bathrooms are in the house. Why not just pick one to end the questions. If there's somebody in there, then maybe the boyfriend will get the hint. Yes, creepy to involve a stranger in your kink, but this isn't a stranger -- and besides, it was a joke. As for which bathroom YOU should use... the second one on the left", "Or he already did", "This. Especially when I'm in a new place. Yes I may know the people, but I feel uncomfortable wondering around someone else's home for the first time. I don't want to accidentally upset or disrespect someone's space.", "I'm curious about this as well.\n\nIs the layout part of the issue? Like having to cross through bedrooms/private spaces/interrupt conversations in order to get to the bathroom?", "It's the same for me. I remember when I was younger and I'd be at a friend's house for the first time and I'd want some water. I'd inevitably be told, \"you can just go into the kitchen and grab one, it's fine.\" \n\nNo lol it is most definitely not fine for me", "I was wondering this too or if it\u2019s an extremely large house."]}
