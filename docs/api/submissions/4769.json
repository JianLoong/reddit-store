However I started to notice he would always come and find me when he needed the bathroom to check which one to use. I always said he could use any that are free. \n\nOne evening I was in the downstairs bathroom getting ready for bed and I got a text from him asking where I was, I said I was in the bathroom, he told me to hurry up because he needed me, I asked what for and he said he needed to go to the bathroom. I thought he meant to use the bathroom I was in so I asked if any of the others were free and he said he didn't know. I told him to go and check, but then he started angry messaging me saying he couldn't and I needed to help him. \n\nI just ignored him as he was being ridiculous and a grown man can go to the bathroom without his girlfriend helping him. \n\nWhen I got back to the bedroom he was still there and was really angry calling me the AH for leaving him in a house he didn't know when he needed the bathroom (he knows where the bathrooms are as he had used each of them at one point or another over the week). \n\nI feel like he's old enough to figure this stuff out himself and I shouldn't have to look after him like this, but at the same time he seemed really angry and upset, so AITA for not helping him find a bathroom?\n\nEdit: I did have a conversation with him after the first couple of times this happened and he said it wasn't anything to do with anxiety, he just needed to know which bathroom to use.

Even if he isn\u2019t like this at home or with his family/friends, he has to be extra on his toes in order to make sure your family likes him and he doesn\u2019t do anything to embarrass himself.

And why should she since he is literally capable of doing every one of those actions? After all, it's not like he is a little kid\n\n>Maybe it's a kink\n\nIt's rude/creepy to involve others in your kink without their knowledge and consent. Even if the other person is your partner...you have an obligation to let them know what you are doing, not just harass them while they are literally in the bathroom, then be angry they didn't respond\n\nAnd your McD/BK analogy isn't great... You have a stake in the food you will be eating, even if you'd be happy with either. OP has *zero* stake in which bathroom he uses. A better analogy would be if your BF asked you which McDonald's *he* should go to for *his* lunch, the one on Main Street or the one on Elm Avenue\n\nNow, please excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. Which one should I use?", "On that case, he might be uncomfortable to knock and potentially disturb anyone on the toilet.", "It's possible he's developed it recently, or maybe he just didn't feel comfortable in the house. I know that I've been at someone's house and not comfortable which made me not want to leave the comfort of my friend/bf/whomever I was with and venture off on my own", "Anxiety was my first thought too.\n\nI have crippling bathroom anxiety. I literally cannot go at all if I think someone could be listening or judging me. Those may not be the best words, but just as an example, any time I've been to a hospital, even overnight,  I can't go to the bathroom unless someone I trust is outside preventing others from knocking. \n\nOnce was particularly bad, as the nurses didn't believe me and insisted on checking on me every 30 seconds, telling me to just hurry up and finish. I lied so they wouldn't cath me, but I wasn't able to go until I was home over a full 24 hours later. And that's not my worst experience. \n\nHomes are different but still weird because most people have an approximate usual time they use the bathroom/shower, and not knowing if someone is going to be urgently knocking in the next two minutes can be enough to make me uncomfortable, especially if I'm not familiar with the personalities of the people I'm with.\n\nMy issues stem from trauma, and I am working on them, but I've learned that they're not terribly uncommon. \n\nI think you handled the situation well. Honestly, I'm upfront with my issues to prevent this sort of thing, and I don't think it's fair for him to be upset for not giving him what he needs when he's not really communicating what that is.\n\nMy vote is a direct and honest conversation about what specifically he needs and some indication as to why so the issue can be better managed.", ">How can OP pick a bathroom for him without literally stopping what she is doing, getting up, walking to the bathroom and checking if it's available? And why should she since he is literally capable of doing every one of those actions?\n\nI think the checking if it's available is where the issue lies. I expect he thinks it would be really embarrassing to knock and find out grandpa/granny is currently using the bathroom. Whereas he doesn't think that would be embarrassing for his gf, as she's their family. \n\nI couldn't care less if I knock on the door, or even walk in, if my mum is in there. But I know my ex felt embarrassed whenever he felt like he'd interrupted her with a knock. And I would always do a quick headcount at his house (to make sure everyone was not in the bathroom) before I nipped to the loo at his parent's place.", "I wasn't suggesting that OP should take any particular action but genuinely asking why not just pick one. I was in no way condoning the boyfriend's behavior. Sorry you took such offense to someone having a question about your absolute. OP knows what bathrooms are in the house. Why not just pick one to end the questions. If there's somebody in there, then maybe the boyfriend will get the hint. Yes, creepy to involve a stranger in your kink, but this isn't a stranger -- and besides, it was a joke. As for which bathroom YOU should use... the second one on the left", "Or he already did", "This. Especially when I'm in a new place.

He clearly considers it a problem. He told her he couldn't go and check the bathrooms repeatedly it seems.", "The man got mad at his girlfriend for *being in the bathroom* because it meant she wasn't available to help him pick out a bathroom. \n\nThat's unbelievably inappropriate and AH-ish, regardless of his reasons, but it's even worse because he's refusing to acknowledge/discuss what exactly his problem is. And even if it was a legitimate anxiety issue, he's a grown man. If he has a debilitating condition that prevents him from figuring out how to use the bathroom at other people's houses, he needs to be actively working on these issues, not expecting his girlfriend to automatically agree to do something that is genuinely odd without explaining why he wants her to do it", "NTA. What in the hell? Yes,he IS a grown ass man and he needs to act like it. He's acting like he's 5 years old. You had already told him several times to just use a bathroom that is free,does he have the memory of a gnat?

If no one answers, you go in and do your business. It's not rocket science.", "I think he needs to take a shit and doesn\u2019t know which bathrooms are safe for smells and potential clogging but is too embarrassed to say his real concern.", "NTA and I would worry about how this kind of extreme \\*incompetence\\* will manifest itself in the future. \n\nIt is a fairly basic social skill to be able to use a bathroom in a place other than one's home especially since there is no rational reason explanation.", "INFO: did this happen before the Queens death and were you actually at Buckingham palace?\n\nThis is the only explanation I\u2019m coming up with", "Maybe he isn\u2019t too bright. I have no explanation other than he walked in on someone.", "I feel like you should figure out what is actually going on here instead of dismissing him.", "\ud83d\udc80", "I don't think the door thing is an issue as they always leave the door open if it's not being used. The bathroom downstairs even has an engaged or vacant sign when you lock it.", "I think it is a weird demand for your attention.\n\nHe wants you to drop everything and help him with something that he thinks is urgent enough to cover for his demands.

You're definitely NTA unless he can somehow manage to tell you a good reason why he's doing this", "Not really, sometimes he will nag at me to cook if I haven't done it in a while ( we cook a big meal two or three times a week and then have leftovers) but it's never been what I would call demanding.", "That\u2019s not ok either. He seems to think you\u2019re his mother. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he asks you to wipe his ass for him next!", "NTA but I definitely have to agree with top comment.

Some houses are just confusing and I could see not remembering where the bathrooms are and which door is a bathroom vs bedroom", "Sometimes controlling behavior can be very quiet and subtle without being outright demanding. My ex is like that. He has a lot of unspoken expectations about what I'm supposed to do and he gets angry or punishes me when I fail to fulfill those expectations. He never demands. In fact, he never even speaks up about his expectations. He just uses anger and punishments to communicate to me that I 'messed up.' Sometimes it's as simple as being grumpy during special occasions to ruin my joy. Sometimes it's worse stuff. Once I recognized his controlling behavior, I could start to make the connection.", "So this be way off base but do you think it\u2019s possible your boyfriend has some kind of medical condition? I\u2019m thinking specifically of some type of agnosia. There\u2019s different types, and it causes things like face blindness but also sometimes an inability to recognize objects or places. He might not know he has it or he knows and he\u2019s covering for it. People with these types of disorders have to developed coping mechanisms because their brains can\u2019t process visual information correctly. So he could walk into an unfamiliar room and see a toilet a sink and a shower but can\u2019t put together that that is a bathroom, so asking someone to direct him to the bathroom ensures he\u2019s going into the right room. Or he could be shown a specific door in a hallway the day before but can\u2019t identify it the next day because his brain can\u2019t distinguish it from all the other doors.
