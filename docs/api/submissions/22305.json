For the past two years, since she had her youngest, I've been the go-to free babysitter. I love my nieces and nephew dearly, but it's becoming too much.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister is a stay-at-home mom, and her husband works full-time. I work from home, which allows me a good amount of flexibility. I don't mind helping out occasionally, but it's become more of a regular occurrence. Almost every other day, she'll drop them off unannounced and disappear for a few hours, or sometimes even the whole day. When I ask her where she's going, she usually just says she has errands to run or appointments, but I've noticed she often posts pictures on social media with friends at a coffee shop or having a \"me day\" at the spa.\r  \n\r  \nI've tried talking to her about how her unannounced visits disrupt my work schedule. I've even proposed setting specific days where I can help, but she dismisses it and says that I should be more flexible since I work from home and don't have kids of my own. She also plays the \"family card,\" stating that as an aunt, it's my responsibility to help out.\r  \n\r  \nLast week, I put my foot down and told her I won't be able to babysit anymore unless it's an emergency or she schedules it in advance. She became furious, calling me selfish and ungrateful. She claims I don't appreciate the 'experience' of being around kids (which she says will help me when I decide to have my own). My parents are now involved, saying I'm creating unnecessary conflict and that family should always be there for each other.\r  \n\r  \nAm I the asshole here, Reddit?", "created_utc": 1689431604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150dkla/aita_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_sisters_children/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You must take a step back from being at your sisters' beck and call.  **It is now time for Your Sister to \"be there for you\"** by understanding and accepting that her behavior is causing you undue stress.

What you're asking for (for them to have basic respect for yourself, your house, your career, your employer, and your work) is completely reasonable. Believe that.

Let's say you worked in an office and not from home.  Would your sister think she could drop off her kids at your office whenever she felt like it and for however long?  \n\nPeople like your sister drive me insane.  I've worked from home for more than 10 years.  So many don't understand the only difference between working from home and going into a physical office is I don't have look professional - I can wear my ratty t-shirts and sweatpants if I want.

Not your kids, not your problem. She is taking advantage of you. Literally she\u2019s trying to live life like she\u2019s single and child free and pushing it onto you. You tried to compromise and only do scheduled days and that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. That makes her an entitled AH. With her having that attitude I\u2019d stop watching them altogether until I was sure she got the message loud and clear that you won\u2019t tolerate her taking advantage.

I also am the younger, unmarried sister that had my nephew all the time.  By the time I married and had kids my sister was \"burnout\" and never gave me a day off.  Set boundaries.", "NTA. Stand firm!", "NTA. \n\nSince it seems like you can\u2019t not answer the door when she pops by, I\u2019d start working at a coffee shop or something. Don\u2019t tell your sister which one or where. \n\nStart calling her out on social media- \u201coh, I thought you were running errands when you dropped off your kids for me to watch WHILE I\u2019M WORKING. Glad to know you are inconveniencing my life (without paying me for it) so that you can go to the spa.\u201d\n\nJust because you are family doesn\u2019t mean that you signed up to be a free babysitter. Your parents can help out with her, since they are the ones that chose to have kids and all.", "NTA she is being entitled and unreasonable.", "NTA. Does she have a key to your place? Can't drop them off if she can't get in.", "Or the grandparents who wanna chime in, if family should always be there for each other then where the heck are they when their daughter needs an almost daily babysitter?", "She\u2019s very manipulative to say the least", "You said everything that needed to be said. NTA", "Apparently, the OP's sister doesn't appreciate the experience of having kids. NTA", "Yes what is up with an adult woman running to complain to mommy and daddy when she has a disagreement with her sis?  Refuse to discuss this with your parents as it\u2019s between you and your sister. Stand your ground. Everyone I know who has kids is practically apologetic to the people who baby sit them because they know child care is work even when it\u2019s family.", "If its that bloody wonderful she oughta look after them herself. Probably just jealous of her sisters lifestyle and resentful of her own.", "Exactly! She made a decision to have three children and wants a free babysitter."]}
