Side boyfriend alarm", "NTA period.\n\nIt wasn't the correct response to call her ungrateful, but she didn't had to be grateful either.  \nIt was just a nice gesture out of love it seems, and she acted like a spoiled princess (like others in the comments saying yta...) cos things didn't happen the way she wanted it.\n\nBut I bet that if you hadn't gone to pick her up and she had gone home in the rain, the issue at home would have been, \"Why didn't you come to get me in the rain?\"", "It sounds like there might have been a misunderstanding between you and your girlfriend. Even though you wanted to help by picking her up due to the rain, she might have felt uncomfortable because she prefers not to have surprises. It's important to respect each other's preferences, especially when they've been previously mentioned. Calling her ungrateful might have escalated the situation. It could be helpful to apologize, talk it through, and try to understand each other's feelings and preferences better to avoid such misunderstandings in the future.", "Nta and it's not normal she's angry about this \n\nThere's 2 possibilities: she's hiding something or she is kind of ocd", "Info: did you being there make her have to leave earlier than she had planned? \n\nThat\u2019s the only reason I can see her justifiably being annoyed, like maybe she wanted to socialise a bit after class or something and was frustrated you changed her plans and made her leave earlier. \n\nWithout further context, if my partner decided to give me a lift unprompted because it was raining and I\u2019d otherwise get wet I would be quite happy about it.", "i dont know what all the Y-Tas are up to, but in the normal world people are grateful to be picked up in the rain. especially after dark.

But if she had such a negative response, don\u2019t do it again since she doesn\u2019t want you to and didn\u2019t show you the appreciation you would have loved. \n\nI think you reacted to her bad reaction, which is unfortunate and only human.

Conversations are an exchange of messages. You can\u2019t expect something to go your way if you message someone and go ahead without a response. That\u2019s the point of waiting for confirmation.

You thought you were going to be her white knight and save her from rain but she clearly doesn\u2019t want someone who tried to rescue her. \n\nRespect her space and don\u2019t show up in aspects of her life intentionally without her permission.", "YTA...she doesn't want YOU to pick you up... maybe she has some other business on the way home that she doesn't want you to know about it", "Relationships shouldn't be transactional - she shouldn't have to \"ask\" to be treated with consideration and kindness.  By that logic she'd have to ask for her birthday card and presents, ask for her dishes to be washed alongside his, ask him if he's loyal to her, ask him to include her in anything in his life. \n\nSaying all that, maybe the key fact here are that she's a student - still growing into her independence, still figuring out her day let alone her life, still emotionally finding her feet - All that stuff. So yeah, \"goddammit how Dare you be nice to me/think you know what I want/presume that I need Anything from you\" etc etc and etc is par for the course and sits easily on the spectrum of possible outcomes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For her to have such a negative reaction to something most people will find super sweet is a tad concerning if she just explained it as she doesn\u2019t like surprises. \n\nFeels like she\u2019s hiding something but one thing is for sure. You two aren\u2019t compatible.", "Ah, yeah thought as much. I work with trauma, so this is pretty classic trauma behaviour eg hate surprises, angry/anxious when boundaries crossed. This is pretty standard emotional response in trauma, so all this \u2018she\u2019s cheating etc\u2019 is likely bull, so don\u2019t stress on it. Her reaction had nothing personally to do with you, but rather a protective trauma response to your behaviour. If you want to develop a healthy relationship together I suggest you both start to work on communicating about how to discuss boundaries/needs and emotional regulation. It\u2019s not ok to be treated badly, regardless of their trauma so it\u2019s ok you discuss if you feel hurt, but you may have to modify and listen as she works on reducing triggers with you. For example, maybe next time if she doesn\u2019t text back, you don\u2019t do it (eg this case pick her up) and tell her that you\u2019ll try that next time to respect her needs. It\u2019s not kindness if it hurts the other person, even if you don\u2019t understand why it hurts. But also let her know you\u2019re just figuring this out, that you were just trying to be nice and didn\u2019t understand the impact. Also, what you said about \u2018being grateful\u2019 came from a place of feeling rejected (I\u2019m guessing here, so if not change to real reason) and you didn\u2019t mean to lash out. But you care about her a lot, so big win.  Your needs matter too, so it\u2019s about communicating how to both feel cared/appreciated etc. \nBut take all this will grain of salt, as generic advice on people I\u2019ve never met.", "Sure but instead of being understanding that she didn\u2019t want a ride he was a jerk about it.", "The thing is, it's only a nice thing if it is wanted. He did something that made HIM feel good, and expects gratitude. That's not really nice, is it.", "If it's \"not about being grateful\", calling her \"ungrateful\" is pretty mean don't you think?", "It's rude to expect gratitude from someone for something they didn't want or ask for.", "No, she has told him before that she doesn't like surprises.", "GF is hiding something. \n\nIn pouring rain,  OP does a nice thing and gies out to b pick up GF.\n\nGF is not only ungrateful but controlling and emotionally abusive.\n\nOP should end this relationship asap.", "If you apologized to her then you already know you\u2019re TA.

Never been in a relationship before, huh?", "You seem to be getting mad because people aren\u2019t reacting the way you think they should to what you say.", "No, it is not. You can tell if messages are read or not. It's still on him.\n\nShe doesn't like surprises. He knows this. He doesn't care.

Her response is extreme only if it\u2019s the first time you\u2019re b doing this. I had a jealous boyfriend once who would just show up to see if I was where I said I was. He always presented it as if him \u201ccaring\u201d or \u201csorry I just want to spend time with you\u201d. \n\nThis post and your responses remind me of this and there\u2019s a lot of context missing.
