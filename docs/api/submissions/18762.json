You can\u2019t eat at drink anything before or during, and you have to chug down this really nasty sweet drink and wait 3 hours.

Even if your husband isn\u2019t internally motivated to join you because he\u2019s concerned about you and his unborn baby, he should be going to support you. At a frigging minimum he should have gone when you asked. Omg that dude is a jerk. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with him on top of having to grow a person inside you and deal with potential pregnancy-related health scares. \n\nSide note he\u2019s also a serious asshole for eating sushi and drinking so often in front of you when you can\u2019t because you\u2019re trying to do the best thing for HIS BABY.

I mean it's not like you got pregnant on your own! I have a 15 month old and we shared all expenses (I'm in the UK so not medical costs but I definitely would have been sharing it otherwise!) \n\nHe sounds like he has not done much at all and this does not bode well for once baby is here.

And why do you have to pay for all pregnancy and baby related stuff? The baby is his too. He is an a**hole.", "NTA. Like, at all. The possibility of having gestational diabetes is a scary thing. I went through that, too. My husband went to every appt, and every test I had without hesitation because we were in this together. \n\nIn addition we also paid for expenses together through our joint bank account, shared household responsibilities, shared grocery expenses, he even would take me to get my pregnancy craving dinner (local caught fish and chips) anytime I wanted, which during the last two months was A LOT!! He would take up the majority of responsibilities when things actually became difficult for me later on in the pregnancy.\n\nI honestly think your husband needs to step up and be an actual partner instead of barely supporting you while you go through the ups and downs of pregnancy. If he truly cared he would go with you without hesitation to your gestational diabetes test (because if you have GD you\u2019re more likely to develop actual diabetes later in life). \n\nHe\u2019s exhibiting so many \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 I would definitely listen to the comments being posted here.

Totally respect wanting to keep finances separate and perhaps you earn more money but you should sit down and decide what things you pay for and what he pays for, proportionate to your income.  If you don't want to both set an amount aside monthly and put it in a shared account for managing child-related finances, there are other options. For example, you could pay for clothing and he could buy all groceries including food for the child; you could pay childcare and he could pay for holidays. It would need assessing every year. But him paying zero pre-natal costs is bad.", "Looks to me like you're looking for sympathy because you know he's in the wrong. But you're the one who's choosing to put up with his crap, so think carefully about how much you need this loser in your life.", "NTA hopefully you find a genie lamp so you can wish to go back in time and have a child with someone who deserves you.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm concerned for you. It seems he's taking little interest in the baby -which he contributed to. \nHe should be paying for more and most certainly going with you to all appointments possible.", "NTA. I developed gestational diabetes at 28 weeks and it sucked (had to do insulin pen injections, write all my blood checks down, have 3 weekly calls to tell them results etc and got scans much more often). Heads up, obv not in many cases, but a year later I developed type 2 diabetes which they think came from having gestational diabetes (I don't fit the \"typical\" type 2 criteria AT ALL) and still on meds for it years later.", "If I were your husband, I would be going unless there was a conflict.

I don't understand how a father would not want to support his wife. \n\nI don't get it. \n\nHe should care and should want to support you, that's what a relationship is about. This is your first child together, he's going to be a father - possibly in name only... It's a big deal. \n\nIt sounds like he's doing the bare minimum and thinking he's making an effort.  I can't stand it when men call women irrational because they disagree with them. You're not, he's being crap. \n\nNTA. What you're asking is perfectly reasonable, he shouldn't need to be asked to support you in this. \n\nIs he interested in this baby? If he is, it's not showing. God help you when the baby is born because I doubt that your husband will.", "Nta\u2026 is he truly supporting you? It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s putting in enough support. \nYou\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t get a medal for doing the bare minimum. You have so many symptoms, your body is changing, you\u2019re paying as if only you created this fetus and you\u2019re doing the majority for something that should be split in half. He should be your partner. He\u2019s not acting like it. I worry you\u2019ll end up doing all the late night feedings, changing diapers, etc.\n\nThis is why I wouldn\u2019t consider having a baby as a woman, though if I were a man I might.

Wild.", "Start budgeting for a nanny, because your husband is going to be fkn useless.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but the bar is low with your husband. Plus he really should be helping more financially with the baby things.\nHe doesn\u2019t do more than \u201cmost\u201d dads, my husband and friends husbands never missed any appointment even if it wasn\u2019t an ultrasound? You deserve to have that support every step of the way.", "First time commenting here, and I'm only doing so because I feel the gener sentiment is quite harmful and ignores the point entirely.\n\nNTA. I think it's reasonable to expect a husband to attend his pregnant wife's appointment. The reasoning most men don't is terrible. Most men (and women) behave like animals imo. No one should be comparing themselves to that low a standard. Also, I'm not sure how it works in your relationship, but I've found coming from a place of reason with empathy often helps when persuading someone you love. I know my father has done many things he did not wish to, simply because my mother told him how much it meant to her and how much strength he gave her (entirely anecdotal though, so take it with a grain of salt).\n\nThat being said, everyone here complaining about how you are financing everything when you are much richer are being ridiculously hypocritical. The only question you should ask yourself is in regards to what they are saying is, if you feel you are supported enough and whether or not you both have sufficient quality down time (from work, parenting and responsibilities). It doesn't have to be equal, nobody is (it's about what you can handle without detriment).", "NTA, it's his baby too. \n\nWhat's he going to say when the baby is here, you are exhausted but he wants his weekend off? He needs to step up, and it starts now. \n\nHe also needs to stop comparing himself to other dads, there are a lot of dads out there that fall short, if that's what he's comparing himself to then it's easy to come out looking good whilst doing the bare minimum. If he does feel the need to compare himself, perhaps he can try looking at the superdads and see how he compares. Right now he's falling short.", "I\u2019d have to get belligerent over my pregnant wife spending her money on everything that isn\u2019t my money\u2026 Like, why is my wife paying for everything, then on top of that tell her I\u2019m not coming to an appointment, even though I don\u2019t need to cover anything\u2026 He isn\u2019t in solidarity with you, why?

You\u2019re asking him to do one thing while you\u2019re growing a human and paying for EVERYTHING (which is insane btw - he\u2019s becoming a parent too, child costs should be split).

Why are you solely responsible for paying for the food you consume? Why are you solely responsible for all financial obligations with this kid?", "NTA. He's 100% wrong on what \"most dads do\". Most dads support their pregnant partners and go above and beyond with whatever help and support is needed. \n\nHe seems very minimally invested in you and the baby.

For all its not invasive or anything not being able to eat then the sudden sugar kick then drop us awful especially since you end up not being able to eat for around 12+ hours all in all.

Yea, tell your husband he doesn't get a prize for doing the minimum as a husband and dad. Definitely NTA. It's a 3 hour test and wait and see.

You could probably find a more supportive roommate at this point.  Most husbands go to as many appointments as they're allowed to.

I dunno if you are prepared to do this by yrself mostly but you should gear up with that mindset based on his attitude. Sweetie this isn't even the hard part and he can't show up and isn't trying. It's hard to see things clearly sometimes, I hope it works out for you but from what you mentioned he doesn't sound like he is really going to step up and actually help raise this baby if he refuses to even do the the small things now.

It's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nFirst, I went to every appointment including the 3 hour gestational diabetes test. I only ever missed appointments because it was for work or I was sick. \n\nSecond, he should want to go because it will affect his life as well since you're looking at a total change in diet for the next few months. So, grab a book and just wait with your wife.", "NTA. \n\nI went to every appt my wife had that I was able to take off work for; while also trying to save as many days for after the baby was born to be there to support mom/baby. \n\nMy wife also got gestational diabetes.  I wasn\u2019t there for the initial blood test because it was just morning fasting; it was a small draw and she was able to go on her own for the 10-15 minutes that it took.  But the vast majority of everything else, I was there for.  \n\nIt\u2019s a exiting, but scary experience.  There\u2019s always a part of you that expects bad news each visit so I wanted to be there for both the good and the bad, because it\u2019s really hard to process the whole situation alone.

Well I changed x diapers and cleaned the kitchen, it\u2019s your turn for 3am freak outs and all the laundry. You guys need to become a team, not business partners, parenting is hard enough. \n\nWhat if something happens? What if the baby needs to stay in the NICU? What if you need to be hospitalized separately? Will he take on the cost and time commitment to be there? \n\nI made more than my partner when the kid was born, and just now it\u2019s changing (7 years later). He has always contributed whatever I have asked, and same now for me. While we have separate bank accounts it\u2019s our family money.

Yes, he doesn't need to stop and you're doing the right thing for not asking him to stop. But these little things makes it sound like he isn't deeply thinking about your perspective, what would feel good for you, what makes you uneasy, etc. He just keeps living normally, focusing on himself, when you would deserve some extra attention and pampering due to how rough time you're going through. And in case it gets even rougher it's not just pampering and sweet attention you would need, but care taking, putting your needs and the baby's needs first and only then his.

I walked upstairs to get dirty clothes, back down the stairs through the living room to the kitchen to do laundry, and couldn't move after 3 steps into the room. I called out for my husband to bring me his tester, and then had to just sit there in the floor eating until my blood sugar came back up.

Like not even close. \n\nWhy are you married to him?\n\nNTA btw", "Nta but Jesus Christ your partner is ! \nI\u2019m 21 weeks pregnant and my husband has been to every single appointment with me ! Even when I went in for my covid and whooping cough jabs ! \nI cannot beleive he isn\u2019t paying half ! You are totally unsupported, emotionally and physically ! Good luck with the pregnancy, I hope he steps up!", "NTA but you partner sure is one for a lot of reason. And he is not doing more than the average man and dad. Neither physically, emotionally (not being considerate to eat sushi somewhere else if he needs it that bad also the appointment) nor financially. How will he be when the child is born? How will you devide the chores and finances then? \n\nAlso he should accompany you to any health appointment that is that long tbh\n\nYou really need to talk about that.", "NTA most definitely not. The thing you married, he is a complete arsehole. Show him this and tell him what a muppet he is.", "NTA, but do you two actually like each other? Does he actually want or seem interested in the baby? Will he parent or care for or do any baby related care? Will he pay for anything? I don\u2019t think I could live like that with someone who is supposed to live me and care for me. He should want to be there, he should care. He is failing. Miserably.", "NTA. When my wife was pregnant not only did I go to every appointment I physically could, I WANTED to go. 50% to support my wife and 50% to actually be involved.\nSeparate to appointments, I pretty much did everything else I could to make her life easier as being pregnant is a full time job on its own!\nHe sounds a bit lazy tbh.\nThe diabetes test appointment is probably the one you'll need the most support at too.\nGood luck with the rest or the pregnancy and birth.... And maybe up your Cleaner's hours once the baby is here.", "Why are you with this person that thinks he gets a medal for doing very basic stuff? \n\nNTA, obviously.", "NTA but your husband sure is! Doesn\u2019t sound like you should expect much change from him. My advice get a good support system around you and make arrangements for when you leave the marriage", "NAH. Fine for you you to ask, but come on, he doesn't need to be there. Take a book with you!\n\nAre you going to make him get up all night with you when you nurse the baby?\n\nHonestly, this doesn't sound like a marriage. Sounds more like a business relationship.", "NTA. He should be there for you, it's his baby too! He should also be stepping up and doing more around the house. Growing a human is tiring work, and he should be looking after you. \n\nI know you've said that you're fine paying everything for the baby, but the fact that you specified the financial split so clearly in the post makes me think you're not actually that ok with it.  Maybe it's time to look at having a joint account for baby/ house related stuff?", "NTA. You don't have a husband/father of your child. You have a roommate. This \"man\" does barely anything for you. Period. He isn't invested in your health or the health of your child. You haven't espoused any of his good qualities. I genuinely hope he doesn't continue on this vein once baby arrives, because its not looking good for you. God forbid you divorce and receive primary custody, he'll argue that you've already paid for everything baby related already, you won't need his money.\n\nTo answer your actual question. Yes, he should go with you to the appointment. That's what you do when your pregnant wife has a health issue relating to pregnancy. He's a dick and needs to step up as a partner.", "NTA but if this is how he is now I am concerned about how he will be as a father. Why are you paying for all your pregnancy related needs. Sure, the pregnancy is happening in your body but that\u2019s both your child. You are doing ALL the work to grow your family, and paying for everything that child will need as well? Make that make sense", "My husband came to every single prenatal appointment. We have three kids. Think about it.", "INFO: Is this your husband's baby? Because he's acting like it belongs to someone else. I could understand if he didn't want to go to the appointments or pay for anything if this were someone else's child. However, if he is the father, then he's not stepping up to claim that title. He's letting you be both mother and father, in which case, he can go f himself. Without further information, I have to conclude you are NTA.", "I mean. He is definitely the AH but your behaviour seems to be enabling him. \n\nThis is his baby too. He has responsibilities. Attending the baby appointments is not \u201cmore than most dads do\u201d. During the pandemic I know of many people becoming fathers who were upset they could not attend all the appointments due to lockdown rules - who wanted to go along and provide support and couldn\u2019t for safety reasons \n\nNot only that - my husband attends non-baby related hospital appointments with me when he can and often takes the day off work to accompany me. \n\nYour husband is scraping the barrel. It might be more than most Dads did in the 1950s but this is 2023. \n\nYou deserve a partner who supports you through the pregnancy - and if he won\u2019t, what makes you think he\u2019ll be an active and responsible parent?", "INFO: Is he your husband or your roommate you ended up accidentally having a baby with?", "Nta, but your husband definitely is. My baby's father was not involved at all, so when I did the test for gestational diabetes,  my roommate came with me. He didn't want me sitting there alone. He went to all my appointments,  even if he just sat in the lobby. He also scooped the litter. My friends built the crib, and between my friends, I'm covered except for formula and diapers. Your husband is doing the bare minimum,  and I doubt that will change once the baby is born.", "NTA. You are correct, he is doing the bare minimum and expects to be rewarded for it.\n\nTo the husband: You also helped make this baby.

Because it will be boring for him? Cool. It\u2019s going to be boring for you too. And you will likely feel incredibly sick on top of the usual pregnancy uncomfortableness. So again why doesn\u2019t he WANT to be there to support you through this? Why does he think anyone other than an utter AH would judge him him positively for not WANTING to support the mother of his child through this? He\u2019s got to sit and chat with you for 3 hours and sees this as something unacceptable? How will he cope with labour when you will be giving him zero attention? When everyone will be basically ignoring him, possibly for days? Days with no x-box, no him time, no chilling about at home? Lady I\u2019m pretty much the same age and am glad my child baring is behind me because the thought of doing it all again even with my super supportive husband makes me shudder.

Terrifying.", "NTA. that being said, continuing to push in this is not the answer. \n\nThe entire time I was reading this post I was taken aback by the sheer bean-counting going on in this relationship. That\u2019s not inherently a bad thing, but from your comments expressing your frustration with your husband\u2019s lack of care, the transactional nature of your interactions right now is causing you serious stress. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really being an asshole here either \u2014 he\u2019s reacting in a way that\u2019s precedented and acceptable in your relationship. It\u2019s okay to be hurt, but it\u2019s not in your best interest to blow this up. I would suggest working on trying to build trust and goodwill in your marriage as best you can right now and trust that you can both put forth your best effort to make this relationship serve your needs better.\n\nThat being said, the way you two are functioning in this tense tit-for-tat is obviously a problem for you. Until you can rely on your husband for the support you need during this time, you should try to outsource as best you can. You are pregnant. Your body is in an incredibly delicate medical condition. Your mental health is almost certainly being affected in some way. This is not to say that your concerns aren\u2019t valid or that your feelings aren\u2019t trustworthy, but that you need to be prioritizing your own care and keeping. You need support right now.
