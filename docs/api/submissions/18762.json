You can\u2019t eat at drink anything before or during, and you have to chug down this really nasty sweet drink and wait 3 hours.

Even if your husband isn\u2019t internally motivated to join you because he\u2019s concerned about you and his unborn baby, he should be going to support you. At a frigging minimum he should have gone when you asked. Omg that dude is a jerk. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with him on top of having to grow a person inside you and deal with potential pregnancy-related health scares. \n\nSide note he\u2019s also a serious asshole for eating sushi and drinking so often in front of you when you can\u2019t because you\u2019re trying to do the best thing for HIS BABY.

I mean it's not like you got pregnant on your own! I have a 15 month old and we shared all expenses (I'm in the UK so not medical costs but I definitely would have been sharing it otherwise!) \n\nHe sounds like he has not done much at all and this does not bode well for once baby is here.

And why do you have to pay for all pregnancy and baby related stuff? The baby is his too. He is an a**hole.", "NTA. Like, at all. The possibility of having gestational diabetes is a scary thing. I went through that, too. My husband went to every appt, and every test I had without hesitation because we were in this together. \n\nIn addition we also paid for expenses together through our joint bank account, shared household responsibilities, shared grocery expenses, he even would take me to get my pregnancy craving dinner (local caught fish and chips) anytime I wanted, which during the last two months was A LOT!! He would take up the majority of responsibilities when things actually became difficult for me later on in the pregnancy.\n\nI honestly think your husband needs to step up and be an actual partner instead of barely supporting you while you go through the ups and downs of pregnancy. If he truly cared he would go with you without hesitation to your gestational diabetes test (because if you have GD you\u2019re more likely to develop actual diabetes later in life). \n\nHe\u2019s exhibiting so many \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 I would definitely listen to the comments being posted here.

Totally respect wanting to keep finances separate and perhaps you earn more money but you should sit down and decide what things you pay for and what he pays for, proportionate to your income.  If you don't want to both set an amount aside monthly and put it in a shared account for managing child-related finances, there are other options. For example, you could pay for clothing and he could buy all groceries including food for the child; you could pay childcare and he could pay for holidays. It would need assessing every year. But him paying zero pre-natal costs is bad.", "Looks to me like you're looking for sympathy because you know he's in the wrong. But you're the one who's choosing to put up with his crap, so think carefully about how much you need this loser in your life.", "NTA hopefully you find a genie lamp so you can wish to go back in time and have a child with someone who deserves you.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm concerned for you. It seems he's taking little interest in the baby -which he contributed to. \nHe should be paying for more and most certainly going with you to all appointments possible.", "NTA. I developed gestational diabetes at 28 weeks and it sucked (had to do insulin pen injections, write all my blood checks down, have 3 weekly calls to tell them results etc and got scans much more often). Heads up, obv not in many cases, but a year later I developed type 2 diabetes which they think came from having gestational diabetes (I don't fit the \"typical\" type 2 criteria AT ALL) and still on meds for it years later.", "If I were your husband, I would be going unless there was a conflict.

I don't understand how a father would not want to support his wife. \n\nI don't get it. \n\nHe should care and should want to support you, that's what a relationship is about. This is your first child together, he's going to be a father - possibly in name only... It's a big deal. \n\nIt sounds like he's doing the bare minimum and thinking he's making an effort.  I can't stand it when men call women irrational because they disagree with them. You're not, he's being crap. \n\nNTA. What you're asking is perfectly reasonable, he shouldn't need to be asked to support you in this. \n\nIs he interested in this baby? If he is, it's not showing. God help you when the baby is born because I doubt that your husband will.", "Nta\u2026 is he truly supporting you? It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s putting in enough support. \nYou\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t get a medal for doing the bare minimum. You have so many symptoms, your body is changing, you\u2019re paying as if only you created this fetus and you\u2019re doing the majority for something that should be split in half. He should be your partner. He\u2019s not acting like it. I worry you\u2019ll end up doing all the late night feedings, changing diapers, etc.\n\nThis is why I wouldn\u2019t consider having a baby as a woman, though if I were a man I might.

Wild.", "Start budgeting for a nanny, because your husband is going to be fkn useless.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but the bar is low with your husband. Plus he really should be helping more financially with the baby things.\nHe doesn\u2019t do more than \u201cmost\u201d dads, my husband and friends husbands never missed any appointment even if it wasn\u2019t an ultrasound? You deserve to have that support every step of the way.", "First time commenting here, and I'm only doing so because I feel the gener sentiment is quite harmful and ignores the point entirely.\n\nNTA. I think it's reasonable to expect a husband to attend his pregnant wife's appointment. The reasoning most men don't is terrible. Most men (and women) behave like animals imo. No one should be comparing themselves to that low a standard. Also, I'm not sure how it works in your relationship, but I've found coming from a place of reason with empathy often helps when persuading someone you love. I know my father has done many things he did not wish to, simply because my mother told him how much it meant to her and how much strength he gave her (entirely anecdotal though, so take it with a grain of salt).\n\nThat being said, everyone here complaining about how you are financing everything when you are much richer are being ridiculously hypocritical. The only question you should ask yourself is in regards to what they are saying is, if you feel you are supported enough and whether or not you both have sufficient quality down time (from work, parenting and responsibilities). It doesn't have to be equal, nobody is (it's about what you can handle without detriment).", "NTA, it's his baby too. \n\nWhat's he going to say when the baby is here, you are exhausted but he wants his weekend off? He needs to step up, and it starts now. \n\nHe also needs to stop comparing himself to other dads, there are a lot of dads out there that fall short, if that's what he's comparing himself to then it's easy to come out looking good whilst doing the bare minimum. If he does feel the need to compare himself, perhaps he can try looking at the superdads and see how he compares. Right now he's falling short.", "I\u2019d have to get belligerent over my pregnant wife spending her money on everything that isn\u2019t my money\u2026 Like, why is my wife paying for everything, then on top of that tell her I\u2019m not coming to an appointment, even though I don\u2019t need to cover anything\u2026 He isn\u2019t in solidarity with you, why?

You\u2019re asking him to do one thing while you\u2019re growing a human and paying for EVERYTHING (which is insane btw - he\u2019s becoming a parent too, child costs should be split).

So I'll be sitting in a waiting room the entire time so yeah, I would prefer if he was there with me to keep me company so I'm not just sitting there alone the whole time.", "Oh i am sorry, didn\u2019t realize being bored for 3 hours while supporting your PREGNANT wife who\u2019s carrying YOUR child for 9 fucking months is such a huuuge ask", "Another voice of reason!!!!  Very few people thinking logically.  Just some guys who thought it was fun to go to all the appointments.  So a guy who doesn't enjoy that must be an AH?!?!?  (facepalm)", "Hello husband who did not expect this post to go this way.", ">That part doesn't bother me. I have a very good job and make good money so I was 100% fine taking that on.\n\nMaybe it's time to stop playing the role of 'cool girl'? Because all it's landed you so far is in a situation where your husband's only contribution to preparing to be a parent is painting the nursery, taking out the cats litter and building some furniture. He believes the few appointments he's attended with you is \"above and beyond\".\n\n\nThere are single parents enjoying pregnancies with more support - including financial - from their family & friends & co-parent than you are right now.", "Yeah I get where you\u2019re coming from and I agree with you. It takes A LOT of work to grow a baby, organize all the appointments to keep baby healthy, attend the appointments, completely change your life to accommodate growing a baby, manage the emotional moments that such a major event can cause, etc etc. Desiring emotional, mental and physical during this time is not irrational. It\u2019s human.", "But is he planning on paying for the kid once it\u2019s here? I\u2019m very hung up that all pregnancy expenses are on you. It took two to tango!", "There's keeping your accounts separate and then there's this. He should be contributing to the costs of the baby that he helped create. If you want to keep it transactional, have him reimburse you his share. What happens when baby arrives? Are you still going to be paying for everything?\n\nSounds more like a sperm donor set up tbh.", "What happens when you have the baby? Are you going to be the only responsible for the baby financial and emotional needs?", "If he loved you, you wouldn\u2019t have to beg him to come to a simple pregnancy appointment lol", "You should revisit this policy, especially when it comes to creating long-term accounts for your kids future. Having a child warrants a much larger look at your financial plans because I guarantee you will find yourself soon spending a LOT of money on child-related expenses if it\u2019s all falling on you without specific tracking. Someone suggested a joint account for child-care related expenses you both can contribute too, which is the best way to start, but definitely have a chat because I guarantee this is a resentment bomb that is being planted down the road.", "It's entirely possible OP might not be able to drive herself home.", "Typically it doesn\u2019t make you sick but it can do that\u2026the only thing to worry about is to make sure you have something to do while you wait, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do in getting your husband to come with you! I hope all goes well.", "When I did the gestational diabetes test 6 months ago, I was prepared for it to be this awful thing because everyone makes it seem like it'll be horrific. After I did it, I never understood why.\n\nThe drink isn't something I'd ever choose to drink, but it tasted like melted popsicles. Super sugary. I got a little light headed for about 15mins, I assume it's the lack of food and then the sugar rush. Worst part was holding my pee and the blood work (I'm afraid of needles). \n\nObviously everyone has their own unique experience but I just wanted to toss it out there that for some people, it's not some crazy horrible procedure.", "When I had my test, it made my baby super active for a while..... sugar rush!", "Doesn't make you actually sick but the taste and sweetness really catches you off guard. It tasted like a mix of vomit (reflux vomit) and off lemonade to me. I managed to keep it down for 30 minutes before it all came back up again. Luckily I had held it just long enough for it to be counted as digested for the test and didn't have to repeat it. They asked me to do it again later in my pregnancy and I straight up just said no. I did bring a banana and protein bar with me so I had something in my system before I left the testing clinic as my other half couldn't drive me. I also bought a book so I wasn't bored for the whole 3 hours.", "Same situation here, I make more. But he still contributes.\n\nIt just generally sounds like he isn't really involved, it may be the way you have written it but still. I had to go do the diabetes test alone but that was because it was a work day. I had some work to do so sat with my laptop but if he hadn't been working he'd have come too.", "Gotcha. Sorry I confused the parties. \n\nAlthough you don\u2019t mind and make good money, he should also be chipping in for those. Along with going all the appointments he\u2019s able to.", "Is he fine with his savings growing and growing while you pay for all of these things that should be a shared expense?", "Putting himself before his wife and child DOES make him the AH. It\u2019s understandable if he\u2019s not able to make it due to work, but he\u2019s fully able to and would rather be lazy.", "You make it sound as if OP is pregnant with another man\u2019s child. That\u2019s his child growing in her. He should be taking as much responsibility as she is.", "I snapped her up before anyone else could!", "Sorry but do you pay for everything,  watch him eat sushi, etc.? He's a loser", "I'm not from US, but here I got tested 6 months after baby was born and again a year later. I did like the extra scans (if everything goes normally, you get just 2 scans during the whole pregnancy), and with gestational it is likely the baby will be bigger so they keep a close eye on that (my 1st born was very premmie, waters went at 32 and he arrived at 34,but was normal pregnancy until then) so I was very anxious! However, with my 2nd, he came at spot on 35 weeks and i had pre eclampsia, but was still a good size (5lbs 7). Fingers crossed for you x", "We don't have any. This will be our first and only. And no, nothing I have mentioned has anything to do with whether or not I think he'll be a good or bad parent. That has nothing to do with the AITA I posted.\n\nEdit: For whatever it's worth, if I felt he would be a crappy dad as a whole then I wouldn't have procreated with him.", "No.  Are you the wife?", "As I wrote earlier, I personally would go, if my wife asked me to.  But I can totally understand it would not be hubby's first choice in how to spend a good portion of his day.  And his being there (or not) will have no impact on the health of his wife and baby.", "I understand your point of view.  And FWIW, I would personally go with you, if I was your husband.  But I have more patience than most.  And whether a guy will go with you or not is up to the individual guy.   He's under no obligation just because he got you pregnant, or because you asked him to go with you.  It's OK to ask.  But the polite way to handle it is you accept his decision gracefully.", "So you want him to hold your hand for 3 hours? Take your phone or a book with you.", "Honey I have had 3 kids, don't even play that card with me, lmao. Plenty of pregnant women go through this extra testing while pregnant. Yes it sucks but it isn't an emergency or a milestone appointment. I sure as hell didn't expect my husband to waste his day.", "My husband has gone through 2 pregnancies with me and didn't go to all the appointments. I still love him", "Well said.", "If she earns significantly more than her husband, it might be in her financial interest to keep separate finances and pay for the baby-related stuff. Not how I'd want to organise a marriage, but if the OP says she's happy with it, who are we to judge?", "I hear what you're saying and appreciate it but would anyone say to stop being the cool guy if it was the husband (who earned much more) and paid for more than the wife did? I'm sure most people wouldn't bat an eye at that and think that was normal. The finances don't bother me and I don't say that to try and be a cool wife or anything of the sort. I would think that anyone in a situation where they earn more in a relationship would take on higher financial burdens. It just seems like the right thing to do.", "We don\u2019t know how their other bills are handled though. If he were making more money, and covering these costs, I doubt anyone would have a problem with that arrangement.", "Thank you!", ">Putting himself before his wife and child DOES make him the AH. \n\nHe's not putting himself before his wife and child.  Think of it this way.  She goes alone.  Or she forces hubby to go with her.  If he doesn't go, does that negatively impact his wife and child?  Only if she's too immature to handle a few routine medical tests without hubby's help!\n\nThe ironic thing here is that she's putting herself before her husband.  She's saying...I need you to be terribly bored, just so I might not be AS bored.  (but I'll still be bored).\n\nThe piece of the puzzle that's missing is that this time (for her) is going to suck, regardless.  So if she cares about her husband at all, she won't insist on ruining his day just because hers is ruined.  I'm going down, so I'll take you with me...\n\nOK if he volunteers.  An AH move to try to force him, though.", "The only way that argument makes sense is if they were both carrying the baby and both had to report for three hours of medical tests.  His being there (or not) will not impact his wife or baby, at all.  The tests will show what the tests show.  As long as she understands the directions from her doctor, then wife and baby will be fine.", "He\u2019s totally a loser. OP needs to open her eyes", "No.", "Boo hoo\n\nPregnancy sucks balls he can suck it up", "She is carrying a child for 9 months and this guy can\u2019t sit with her for 3 hours\n\nShe didn\u2019t get pregnant alone and ofc this time is so hard on her body and mentally\n\nShe is also paying for all the baby things which is absolutely absurd!! \n\nHe gets to eat and drink what he wants when he wants\n\nShe is NTA for asking and the husband can get his ass up and go with her", "She\u2019s not asking him if he\u2019d go to the grocery store with her. She\u2019s asking him to come with her to a baby related appointment so she doesn\u2019t have to do it alone. Why should he be able to opt out when she doesn\u2019t??", "But it\u2019s not like he cannot go\n\nAre you only meant to be doing what\u2019s obligated of you in a relationship\n\nA partner has expressed she wants some support and wants the husband to cone with her\n\nYou can be more independent and more capable and a saint for having 3 children and dealing with everything yourself\n\nBut she is allowed to ask her husband for help and support\n\nIt\u2019s not like she is forbidding him for eating or drinking\n\nApparently this guy isn\u2019t even paying for the baby\u2019s things. They decided to get pregnant, the least he can do is suppprt his partner when she wants his support\n\nYou don\u2019t only help your partner when its an emergency", "And here she says she wants him to come with her?? You can have different needs and boundaries in your relationship, OP has hers\nDoesn\u2019t make one way right\nExcept the husband is part of that relationship so should at the least support her through this time\nDon\u2019t understand why she is being unreasonable for some reason", "Because you are mature and SANE, obviously...", "Perhaps a joint bank account for baby (and going forward,  child) related things on which you both deposit a proportional amount you both agree on? You don't have to put in equal amounts but maybe review it once a year.\n\nBut this dude doesn't sound like he is gonna be a good or supportive father or partner. If he is providing bare minimum be aware it's you who has to pick up the slack.\n\nBeing a parent/ partner takes 100% from all involved. If he is only providing 50% of his share, you have to provide 150% to compensate. This is what causes many many relationships to end.\n\nNTA, he needs to step up before this becomes a problem for you.\n\nHis excuse of \"I'm better than nothing/ others\" is bull. Many women find after separation they have more money, energy, free time, and confidence once their ex is force to be a weekend father and pay child support. Sometimes nothing is better than an unsupportive spouse.", "See you seem like a mature person \n\nWhy are you literally still with this guy who doesn't recognize his responsibilities. It's more like you're just room mates.", "Leaving besides the financials for the moment.\n\nHow do you see him carrying the mental load in the future? Does he seem reliable?\n\nYou both work full-time, yet it seems you already carryng most of the mental load with the child....and it's not even born yet.\n\nHave you discussed child these things with him yet?", "Yes, she will be going through it regardless. Those types of appointments are for both because he can ask his own questions on what to do if something were to take a turn for the worst.\n\nGoing to a doctors appointment is absolutely nothing compared to what she\u2019s going through right now, physically and mentally, so the very LEAST, he could show some care and concern by going to the appointment.", "Aaaand when she's not allowed to drive home does she walk? That'd certainly be more comfortable for King Hubby, so I suppose she should. You do realise that this is a serious medical appointment about a potentially life-threatening condition? That the three-hour wait is waiting for meds that can make you really unwell to take effect so that the medics can do their tests. But ... you're right, this would interfere with hubby's important leisure time, so fuck her and their unborn child.", "So if he's not just as miserable as she is, that makes him a bad husband?  Just asking, as that seems to be your point.", ">She is NTA for asking and the husband can get his ass up and go with her\n\nI totally agree, as far as that goes.  But it's optional, not an obligation.  He CAN indeed get his ass up and go with her.  If that's what he wants to do.  He's not an AH for thinking he'd rather not though.", "BECAUSE HE IS NOT SUFFERING FROM PREGNANCY RELATED DIABETES\n\nSorry to do the all caps thing, but that's a pretty fricking OBVIOUS point that most seem to be missing.  He can opt to go (that is valid).  He can opt not to go (that is also valid)  He can not change the test results.  (DUH)  Doctors will have no difficulty at all figuring out how to treat the wife.  Hubby's presence is not necessary.", "You also don't force your partner to do things they don't want to. Their relationship doesn't even sound like a partnership. I don't know why she would expect this from him. She should have thought about all of that before marriage and getting pregnant.", "She's only unreasonable if she tries to force the issue, as him being there or not will have no impact on her or the baby.", "Eh I\u2019m only asking my husband to go to the ultrasound appointments. I don\u2019t see the need for him to go to other appointments.", ">Aaaand when she's not allowed to drive home does she walk? \n\nSince you have the crystal ball, ask it what my answer is.", "Relationships are give and take. They involve reciprocity. If your life partner is undergoing 9+ months of extreme physical and mental changes to give you a child the least you can do is a few favors. \n\nMelodramatic much? Hanging out with your wife for a couple hours in a waiting room will never be as \u201cmiserable\u201d as carrying a child to term. Nor is this a pissing contest, really.

If your life partner is undergoing 9+ months of extreme physical and mental changes to give you a child the least you can do is a few favors.\n\nYou act as if he held a gun to her head and said \"I want a baby\".  Usually, these are mutual decisions.  In fact, it's not unusual at all for the wife to want a baby more than hubby does, and hubby will (eventually) agree.  As a woman you have to know (at least somewhat) what you are getting yourself into before you CHOOSE to get pregnant.  And when you do, you definitely aren't going to do that JUST because it's what your partner wants!!!", ">And having him there might help her pass the time faster and is it soo bad to want love and support from your partner even if your absence isn\u2019t actively killing the child\n\nAgain, somebody arguing from her point of view, as if the husband doesn't have a right to his own thoughts / feelings.
