We get along well and didn't fight much which is why l'm confused over this situation. \nGf lives on her own in apartment and works full time. Where as I am still living with my parents until I finish college. I was originally planning on moving in with my gf into her apartment once she renews her lease until we had our disagreement.\nmy gfs place is pretty basic, I guess you can say it's got a \"modern and minimalist\" look, that is until u go to her bedroom. There's a lot of these glow in the dark stars all over her closet door and wall. I remember when I asked her about it she told me that when she was young she experienced a traumatic event. To help with her anxiety she placed the stars as a guild to help her see if there was a silhouette either in front of the door or if the door was open? (idk if that makes sense). She said she only asked that I keep that door close especially at night.\n I was understandable about the situation. So when I first spent the night over, I made sure to check if the closet was closed while she slept earlier. Months went by and there were instance where I did accidentally forgotto close it. She\u2019d wake up the next day and ask me about it \"hey did u forget to close the door last night.\u201d I  apologized for it, and she\u2019d saying something like please don't forget next time. I had no problem with it at first, though lately it's been getting annoying. It felt like that's all she wanted to talk about first thing in the morning. I voice my feelings on it one day and she just responded by saying \"well then please close the door, it's not that hard. I sometimes deal with sleep paralysis\" I got irritated by that because it felt like she just wanted a reason to nag me. One day, I went over to visit her, I decided to purposely leave the closet door open while she slept in her bed while I slept on the living room couch just to see what would happen. assumed nothing happened since I didn't hear anything. However the next day when I woke up, she was sitting at the kitchen table looking she had been crying since her eyes were puffy. Before I could even say a word she said \"I've told you many times that I wanted that closet door closed. It's all I ever asked of you and you can't even do that\". Here's where I might be the ah, I got angry that she was already nagging me about this first thing in the morning so I told her that she's a grown woman and can't rely on some dumb stickers to help her over something that happened to her years ago, and she needed to get over it. She told me to leave so I did because I was mad. It's been a week since then and I haven't heard anything from her. I don't want to break up over this but I wanna know if what I said was wrong. My parents and friends are saying my gf is being dramatic but I want some unbiased opinions on the subject. \nEdit: I want to clarify that my gf never leaves the closet door open. I would go in to get something and would occasionally forget but the door also makes this unbearable squeaking noise when you\u2019re trying to close it back up. So that\u2019s why I also leave it as it is.", "created_utc": 1689842358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154l6ud/aita_for_not_wanting_to_close_my_gfs_closet/", "score": 2410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a prick.", "YTA the fucking audacity of men like you complaining of their partners \"nagging\" them when they repeatedly fail to do one simple thing asked if them.

I am SO GLAD that she isn\u2019t speaking to you anymore. Consider yourself the ex. You are despicable, minimizing her trauma of having a grown ass man break into her room at night when she was a child. And you purposely leaving it open to \u201ccatch her lying\u201d. Jesus Christ, when did you go to post grad and become a therapist? Who in the world do YOU THINK YOU ARE  to have the authority to willfully traumatize her to \u201ccatch her in a lie\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s getting therapy for this very minimal accident where nothing happened\u201d so \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t need the door closed with those silly stars\u201d.  Have you thought about the possibility that she may have been in a state of paralysis for HOURS, having a panic attack, hyperventilating, and UNABLE TO CALL FOR HELP DUE TO BEING PARALYZED.

ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS CLOSE THE DOOR! The other night I got triggered by holding a stuffie in bed with my boyfriend and suddenly had flashbacks so bad that I had a panic attack and he had to take me on a hour and a half walk so I could calm down enough to sleep. He even went and got donuts. It was nearly 10 am by the time we went to bed. NO COMPLAINTS!

Then close the door. \n\nAlso, you tell her she needs to get over it and how she should just get over her trauma. That's not how trauma works, educate yourself. She was coping perfectly fine and has found a method that works for her, until you showed up and started to just stomp over the ine thing she's asked you.

The bar is literally so fucking low, dude, and you still tripped on it.", "Let me phrase it this way for you: you care about not closing a door more than you care about your girlfriend. \n\nRead it again. \n\nNow add in that you care about being right more than you do about your girlfriend. You're trying to make decisions in her home you simply don't have the right to make. You don't get to decide to make her \"face her fear\". You don't get to decide she's over reacting. Hell you don't get to decide to leave the door open for any reason because it's her home, not yours. \n\nDon't worry about breaking up over this, sounds like she already made her decision, and the right one at that. You really need to get over yourself if you want other people in your life. Yta", "YTA you never heard of closing the god darn door?", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a *very* simple request that brings her peace of mind. It\u2019s important to her, so if you care about her, it should be important to you by extension. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to judge the gravity of someone else\u2019s trauma. And ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter. Trauma or not, the request does not inconvenience you.\n\nShe\u2019s going to learn that you will not be there for her. When something big comes up and she needs your help, she has to hope you deem it both serious and enough to care and that the request doesn\u2019t inconvenience you one bit, otherwise you\u2019ll let her struggle.", "Question you do know trauma has no linear \"fix\" correct?  While it is childish to you its how her brain copes. Honestly wanting to purposely hurt your significant other is horrible.

A huge ah, she really needs to leave you.", "INFO: Did you tell all these people who are allegedly on your side that your gf has childhood trauma that causes closed closet doors to be important to her, and you were giving her a cruel test to see if her trauma was real?

Set her free, she doesn\u2019t deserve your bullshit.", "It's the simplest request. But also it's not about the door. It's about the fact that you do not have empathy for your gf and don't want to respect her. End of story. You'd rather her have a bad night than do something small.

I'm pretty sure it's over\n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nYou PURPOSELY hurt your partner to attempt to prove yourself right; that is just sick and cruel. Your statement of \" I wanna know if what I said was wrong\" shows a seriously deep lack of empathy and not caring about anyone but yourself *to the intentional detriment of others*.

Do you seriously not understand that *this is the first thing she sees in the morning* and that triggers her? Of course she\u2019s going to bring it up in the morning!

DELIBERATELY not closing the closet door to see what would happen is an asshole move on your part.

We get along well and didn't fight much which is why l'm confused over this situation. \nGf lives on her own in apartment and works full time. Where as I am still living with my parents until I finish college. I was originally planning on moving in with my gf into her apartment once she renews her lease until we had our disagreement.\nmy gfs place is pretty basic, I guess you can say it's got a \"modern and minimalist\" look, that is until u go to her bedroom. There's a lot of these glow in the dark stars all over her closet door and wall. I remember when I asked her about it she told me that when she was young she experienced a traumatic event. To help with her anxiety she placed the stars as a guild to help her see if there was a silhouette either in front of the door or if the door was open? (idk if that makes sense). She said she only asked that I keep that door close especially at night.\n I was understandable about the situation. So when I first spent the night over, I made sure to check if the closet was closed while she slept earlier. Months went by and there were instance where I did accidentally forgotto close it. She\u2019d wake up the next day and ask me about it \"hey did u forget to close the door last night.\u201d I  apologized for it, and she\u2019d saying something like please don't forget next time. I had no problem with it at first, though lately it's been getting annoying. It felt like that's all she wanted to talk about first thing in the morning. I voice my feelings on it one day and she just responded by saying \"well then please close the door, it's not that hard. I sometimes deal with sleep paralysis\" I got irritated by that because it felt like she just wanted a reason to nag me. One day, I went over to visit her, I decided to purposely leave the closet door open while she slept in her bed while I slept on the living room couch just to see what would happen. assumed nothing happened since I didn't hear anything. However the next day when I woke up, she was sitting at the kitchen table looking she had been crying since her eyes were puffy. Before I could even say a word she said \"I've told you many times that I wanted that closet door closed. It's all I ever asked of you and you can't even do that\". Here's where I might be the ah, I got angry that she was already nagging me about this first thing in the morning so I told her that she's a grown woman and can't rely on some dumb stickers to help her over something that happened to her years ago, and she needed to get over it.

It will link stimuli  (something to do with the traumatic event, such as a smell, a place, an object, a person, a sight) with feelings of fear. For example, in veterans, it's common for loud noises (the stimulus) to trigger intense feelings of fear and for them to be transported back to that memory. Thus the phrase \"neurons that fire together, wire together'. \n\nThis link is INCREDIBLY difficult to dissolve. This is why PTSD in veterans is so difficult to manage. This also applies to victims of all types, but I am using the example of veterans because something tells me that it will be easier for you to understand trauma in men who have gone to war than in women who have feared for their lives because you see what they have gone through as a 'valid' reason to feel fear/trauma. \n\nIt does not matter if you don't agree that what your (hopefully ex) girlfriend suffered should have been traumatizing. The amount of fear she experienced during the event caused the memory to be stored in such a way that it caused trauma. Now, the stimulus of an open closet will spark a PTSD episode of intense fear and re-living of the traumatic event (the fear of her space being violated, of her fearing for her life, of fearing being raped or harmed).  \n\nYour girlfriend has very smartly found a way to avoid this stimulus and asked you to help her with that in a very small way. Honestly, that you think your opinion has any value here is mind-boggling. It does not MATTER if you understand or not. A person you supposedly care about is giving you a very simple way of making her happy/saving her from a PTSD episode. The fact that you do not take this as an opportunity to keep her safe is troubling. \n\nYTA to the extreme.

Yet here you're saying it was important to make sure she wasn't lying about something so serious.\n\nYou can't have it both ways. Either this is very serious, meaning you knowingly triggered her trauma because you wanted to make sure she wasn't lying and you couldn't have an adult conversation about that. Or it's not serious at all and you refuse to do the very simple favor of closing her door because you're not willing to give her even the smallest consideration.\n\nYour comments are all extremely dismissive of your girlfriend, likening her to a child and claiming that because she wasn't physically assaulted she's worked up over nothing. She doesn't see it that way. Neither does her therapist, who is trained and licensed to help her work through this. You figure that since you were helped by a specific method, that's the only valid one and she's foolish for not doing it your way. How can you not see how condescending that is, to assume that you know better than professionals and the person who's actually dealing with the trauma?\n\nYou say you're not broken up with your girlfriend, but I strongly encourage you to reconsider that stance. Everything about your post and your comments scream that you don't respect your girlfriend or her experience and are not willing to make any effort to do the simple things she asks for because of your own warped views, and because you feel bad when you forget so you might as well just deliberately not do it.

Panic attacks, flashbacks, manic episodes, can all be triggered by a single thing (SUCH AS A CLOSET DOOR BEING LEFT OPEN BY AN AH) and they can have deadly results. Maybe try thinking about it like that? It\u2019s \u201cchildish\u201d until it isn\u2019t. \n\nThe biggest takeaway from this is that you didn\u2019t love her as much as you thought you did. If you did, you would\u2019ve gone to the ends of the earth to do all the little things to make her feel safe, loved, and respected. You don\u2019t even get to think \u201cOh she should be handling it this way or that way\u201d because you don\u2019t have to live in her body.

I instinctively close doors that I see open when in someone's house whom I'm close with.\n\nI don't think she made it his responsibility as much as asked him to be understanding of her trauma. A lot of trauma is irrational and people with it can be self-aware. The worst combination, let me tell you, because it's humiliating when you can't control your actions/thoughts/emotions. It's even further humiliating when you get blamed for these eruptions as if they were intentional.\n\nI've seen people with PTSD experience flashbacks and I've had them myself. It's something that can happen at a moment's notice and, while we can \"grow up\" and \"get over it\", it's a lot more difficult than that so a little more consideration on OP's part would have gone a long ways.", "intentionally leaving the door open and sleeping in the other room wasn't doubling down?", "And yet every single one of your comments just makes you look worse and worse.", "She even told him how they help her cope, and he's ignoring it.", "If someone tells you they're going to kill themselves bc you want to break up with them, they're  either manipulating you or batshit crazy.
