We get along well and didn't fight much which is why l'm confused over this situation. \nGf lives on her own in apartment and works full time. Where as I am still living with my parents until I finish college. I was originally planning on moving in with my gf into her apartment once she renews her lease until we had our disagreement.\nmy gfs place is pretty basic, I guess you can say it's got a \"modern and minimalist\" look, that is until u go to her bedroom. There's a lot of these glow in the dark stars all over her closet door and wall. I remember when I asked her about it she told me that when she was young she experienced a traumatic event. To help with her anxiety she placed the stars as a guild to help her see if there was a silhouette either in front of the door or if the door was open? (idk if that makes sense). She said she only asked that I keep that door close especially at night.\n I was understandable about the situation. So when I first spent the night over, I made sure to check if the closet was closed while she slept earlier. Months went by and there were instance where I did accidentally forgotto close it. She\u2019d wake up the next day and ask me about it \"hey did u forget to close the door last night.\u201d I  apologized for it, and she\u2019d saying something like please don't forget next time. I had no problem with it at first, though lately it's been getting annoying. It felt like that's all she wanted to talk about first thing in the morning. I voice my feelings on it one day and she just responded by saying \"well then please close the door, it's not that hard. I sometimes deal with sleep paralysis\" I got irritated by that because it felt like she just wanted a reason to nag me. One day, I went over to visit her, I decided to purposely leave the closet door open while she slept in her bed while I slept on the living room couch just to see what would happen. assumed nothing happened since I didn't hear anything. However the next day when I woke up, she was sitting at the kitchen table looking she had been crying since her eyes were puffy. Before I could even say a word she said \"I've told you many times that I wanted that closet door closed. It's all I ever asked of you and you can't even do that\". Here's where I might be the ah, I got angry that she was already nagging me about this first thing in the morning so I told her that she's a grown woman and can't rely on some dumb stickers to help her over something that happened to her years ago, and she needed to get over it. She told me to leave so I did because I was mad. It's been a week since then and I haven't heard anything from her. I don't want to break up over this but I wanna know if what I said was wrong. My parents and friends are saying my gf is being dramatic but I want some unbiased opinions on the subject.", "created_utc": 1689842358, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154l6ud/aita_for_not_wanting_to_close_my_gfs_closet/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dismissed something that was important to her and the way she likes her own home to be, didn\u2019t care enough to remember consistently, and then purposely did something hurtful and petty that could trigger her past trauma and THEN instead of taking responsibility for doing exactly what she said you did you then made fun of her and minimized her pain. \n\nI hope she dumps you.

I am SO GLAD that she isn\u2019t speaking to you anymore. Consider yourself the ex. You are despicable, minimizing her trauma of having a grown ass man break into her room at night when she was a child. And you purposely leaving it open to \u201ccatch her lying\u201d. Jesus Christ, when did you go to post grad and become a therapist? Who in the world do YOU THINK YOU ARE  to have the authority to willfully traumatize her to \u201ccatch her in a lie\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s getting therapy for this very minimal accident where nothing happened\u201d so \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t need the door closed with those silly stars\u201d.  Have you thought about the possibility that she may have been in a state of paralysis for HOURS, having a panic attack, hyperventilating, and UNABLE TO CALL FOR HELP DUE TO BEING PARALYZED. And you wonder why she had puffy eyes the next morning, and instead of saying \u201coh my love I am so sorry\u201d or something of the sort you GOT ANGRY? Do you not even care for her at all?

But you deliberately do it way too many times, I just know you\u2019re lying about purposely doing it once. \n-trying to minimize the issue by putting this as your title when it\u2019s literally causing your gf to have sleep paralysis\n-You minimized her trauma when there was a man in her closet when she was young. And forcing her to experience that trauma again when she\u2019s already had a healthy coping mechanism.\n-calling her coping mechanism childish. Is glow in the dark some you can\u2019t have when you\u2019re old? \n-saying you know better than her therapist\nGod dude. You sound a nightmare to be around.

ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS CLOSE THE DOOR! The other night I got triggered by holding a stuffie in bed with my boyfriend and suddenly had flashbacks so bad that I had a panic attack and he had to take me on a hour and a half walk so I could calm down enough to sleep. He even went and got donuts. It was nearly 10 am by the time we went to bed. NO COMPLAINTS!

Then close the door. \n\nAlso, you tell her she needs to get over it and how she should just get over her trauma. That's not how trauma works, educate yourself. She was coping perfectly fine and has found a method that works for her, until you showed up and started to just stomp over the ine thing she's asked you. And not only that, but you deliberately left the door open knowing how much stress it will cause her (and you definitely knew, because she told you)\n\nYTA. And I dint think you'll be moving in with her.", "You\u2019re the biggest asshole I\u2019ve seen on here in awhile. I\u2019m not even going to list the ways because all you\u2019re doing is arguing with people in the comments. You are clearly wrong about everything here. Oh and obviously she has already dumped you if you\u2019re not speaking and she wants you to grab your stuff. Which, good. The bar is literally so fucking low, dude, and you still tripped on it.", "Let me phrase it this way for you: you care about not closing a door more than you care about your girlfriend. \n\nRead it again. \n\nNow add in that you care about being right more than you do about your girlfriend. You're trying to make decisions in her home you simply don't have the right to make. You don't get to decide to make her \"face her fear\". You don't get to decide she's over reacting. Hell you don't get to decide to leave the door open for any reason because it's her home, not yours. \n\nDon't worry about breaking up over this, sounds like she already made her decision, and the right one at that. You really need to get over yourself if you want other people in your life. Yta", "YTA you never heard of closing the god darn door?", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a *very* simple request that brings her peace of mind. It\u2019s important to her, so if you care about her, it should be important to you by extension. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to judge the gravity of someone else\u2019s trauma. And ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter. Trauma or not, the request does not inconvenience you.\n\nShe\u2019s going to learn that you will not be there for her. When something big comes up and she needs your help, she has to hope you deem it both serious and enough to care and that the request doesn\u2019t inconvenience you one bit, otherwise you\u2019ll let her struggle.", "Question you do know trauma has no linear \"fix\" correct?  While it is childish to you its how her brain copes. Honestly wanting to purposely hurt your significant other is horrible. If you don't like how she copes I suggest you both walk away from this relationship before you damageher mental health even more. YTA", "YTA. A huge ah, she really needs to leave you.", "INFO: Did you tell all these people who are allegedly on your side that your gf has childhood trauma that causes closed closet doors to be important to her, and you were giving her a cruel test to see if her trauma was real? Or did you just tell them that she threw a fit and kicked you out because you didn't close her closet doors?\n\nYTA either way, I'm just trying to figure out if your parents and friends are also terrible people.", "YTA, you seem like the worst person to turn to for support. Set her free, she doesn\u2019t deserve your bullshit.", "It's the simplest request. But also it's not about the door. It's about the fact that you do not have empathy for your gf and don't want to respect her. End of story. You'd rather her have a bad night than do something small.

I'm pretty sure it's over\n\nYTA.", "YTA \n\nYou PURPOSELY hurt your partner to attempt to prove yourself right; that is just sick and cruel. Your statement of \" I wanna know if what I said was wrong\" shows a seriously deep lack of empathy and not caring about anyone but yourself *to the intentional detriment of others*. I'd let your GF go without any issues before you traumatize her further AND I would refrain from beginning any other intimate relationships until you address your need to be right over treating people's reasonable requests like a challenge.", "YTA. Do you seriously not understand that *this is the first thing she sees in the morning* and that triggers her? Of course she\u2019s going to bring it up in the morning! You have no business telling her how to cope, or worse, doing whatever tf you want because *you think* she should be coping differently. You wanted to prove she wasn\u2019t lying\u2026 why tf would she be lying about this?! She has told you, confided in you, cried to you so many times and you STILL choose to be a prick about this?\n\nHer solution isn\u2019t \u201cchildish\u201d, as you keep repeating in the comments\u2026 it\u2019s a very simple and effective way to let her know that no one is near her doors. \n\nPlease, for the love, listen to everyone in the comments saying the same thing over and over again. ACCEPT YOHR VERDICT and stop trying to defend yourself. YTA and you will not change anyone\u2019s mind about that.", "YTA. DELIBERATELY not closing the closet door to see what would happen is an asshole move on your part.

Take the ruling, stop trying to justify your actions. I can\u2019t believe her asking one small thing bothers you so much. You say her coping mechanism is that of a child and yet YOU are the one that needs to grow up!", "YTA - it\u2019s really not hard to close a closet door. Then you double down and do it on purpose.
