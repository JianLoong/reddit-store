In my country(Sweden), you'll receive money for going to school, and until you're 18, that money goes to the legal guardian. \n\nIt's important to explain that my mom has always had it horrible with money, she spends money she doesn't have, loans money she can't pay back and is in 1.2 million kr debt, (ca 120k usd). And everything has always been about her and her money. Whenever I hurt myself, it's been \"how can I get insurance off of this\", whenever something breaks, \"Money.\", whenever I'm home from school, it's never \"How are you feeling?\", she immediately shames me for being sick. You can probably imagine what's that done to my self-worth and confidence.\n\nNow, I have several mental illnesses, the specifics are not important, but my mother has done everything to profit off of them. This is important because when I had to take an extra term in college, we couldn't get the usual money for me, because it wasn't full-time. So instead my mom found out that we could apply for \"Activity benefits\" (roughly translated), something only people with handicaps and mental illness can get. It was granted, and I was given a big sum of 2800$ Usd for the three months I'd already gone to school.\n\nNow, I don't have a problem with paying rent. Even though I don't have an obligation to yet as long as I go to college, I don't have a problem with it. But I know my mom, and I knew she would ask an absurd amount. Mind, we live in a small 880$ a month apartment. The monthly sum she came up with was roughly 830$ a month, which I thought was ridiculous. And because of the three months I didn't pay her (I had no income), she wanted 1780$ of the 2800$ I got. \n\nWhen she told me all this, she must've noticed I got upset, and I finally cracked and said all the things I've been bottling, how it never seemed like my wellbeing was considered. How it wasn't fair because I live 65% of the time at my Adoptive dad so realistically speaking he should get the majority, which of course she hadn't even considered.\n\n I was actually quite surprised she let me say all this. For a few seconds, she was silent, then she went off on me, calling me everything but a burden, which hurt, alot. She said how cruel I was being, that she had no money and I said responded with \"Who's fault is that? Because it's certainly not mine.\". Which made her even more angry. I finally said something I sort of regret, I said that I wanted a mother, not a landlord. I still mean that, because she hasn't been a mother to me in years besides feeding me, I guess. She gave me the most hateful glare at that, and I actually thought she was going to hurt me. She said something that stuck, \"I'll never forgive you for this, I swear to God.\" And she hasn't yet, hasn't even spoken to me. \n\nI just need to know if ITA, I feel like I'm being reasonable, and logical, but she calls me childish and stupid at every chance she gets.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698502091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17iejp0/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_mom_the_sum_she_deems/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
