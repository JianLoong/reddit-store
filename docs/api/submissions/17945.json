That is a family killer right there. \n\nWhen this didn't go as planned, you expected everyone to forget the terrible things you'd said and done so it wouldn't be difficult for you. \n\nYou were unhappy that your DIL wouldn't let you hold or photograph the baby after your son made a sincere effort to get you all in the same room. After you threatened to take their children without their consent. It sounds like you also posted or shared to Facebook without parental consent at some time? \n\nYou made the choice to ruin dinner with a snotty comment. You knew it wasn't helpful, but you said it anyway. \n\nYou said more terrible things when your son (understandably) said this would not work. You still expected him to put you first, including on Mothers Day when he has the mother(s) of his children to focus on. \n\nThen you blamed this behaviour on alcohol. \n\nThen you expected him to forget the terrible things you'd said and done. Again. Spotting the pattern here?\n\nAnd as a final knife twist, you make a dramatic statement about your will and POA for...what? What did you hope to gain here? You could have sent him a polite letter explaining this and allowed him to process it in his own time. He wanted less manipulative drama. You forced it on him anyway, and pretended it was 'giving him what he wanted'. \n\n-------------------\n\nThrough all this you're blaming his wife. Did it occur to you they may have made this decision as a couple for the happiness of their family? It says more about you that you assume B is holding a whip.  \n\nOr perhaps he made this decision alone because he's finally had enough of your poor behaviour and has found happiness he will protect at all costs, including from his mother. \n\nGet some help for your alcohol use. A lot of the help will force you to be introspective in all areas of your life. If you put the effort in you will learn why you are so very, very wrong here.

Then your son tries to do the adult thing, and his wife does the mature thing... but you can't seem to function as an adult, so you need to get some jab in there to try and make her think *you* won.

You cannot say whatever you want and then be sorry and then do it again, and expect people to take it over and over.  This is abusive.

Looking back, I know I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. My son called me later that night and told me that he couldn\u2019t continue to have a relationship with me. He said that B was their child's mother, and he wouldn\u2019t ever bring the baby anywhere without her blessing. I was drunk when he called because I have had a hard time coping, and I admit I lost it a little bit on the phone call and told him it was despicable that he couldn\u2019t man up to his wife, and that he should have come to see me on mothers day because I am his mother. He ended up hanging up on me. \r  \n\r  \nI called the next day and profusely apologized to him. I know it was wrong of me to have said what I did, and I told him I want a relationship with him. He told me he couldn\u2019t do this with me anymore. \r  \n\r  \nI have been heartbroken ever since, but I understand I guess. I called him last night and told him that I wouldn\u2019t be contacting him or his wife anymore ever, and that I respected that we wouldn\u2019t have a relationship. I also let him know I would be taking him off as my power of attorney and out of my will so he never had to be bothered with anything from me again. I don\u2019t have much anyways. \r  \n\r  \nHe got mad at me and called me a sorry excuse of a mother, and now my daughter is saying I\u2019m manipulative. I really don\u2019t understand how I was wrong in giving him what he wants.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You did it specifically to make him feel guilty about choosing to cut off contact.\n\nYou are being a narcissist for thinking that he should abandon his WIFE on her 1st Mother's Day to come see you after you treated his wife poorly. Your son is doing the right thing.

You\u2019re making him sound like he\u2019s a wimp who can\u2019t stand up to his wife and basically saying his wife is awful. If you want to mend the relationship you have to mend it with b. And not continually tell your son to man up to her. I don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t like b but it\u2019s clear your son will choose her over you so if you wanted any part of them then you needed to respect her too even if you think she\u2019s the manipulative and controlling one.

He is right, that is the mother of his child and she and the child come first in his life. You just described what most people call The Toxic Mother In Law. I can almost guarantee you pushed and pushed until DIL finally snapped and you didn't like how that felt. You possibly thought your son would automatically take your side but he took his wife's side. You cannot get away with trying to enforce your rules and wants on other people and expect them to fall in line. It's not hard to be respectful and stay within your lane. It also sounds like you'd be the same person that would reveal a baby's gender or pregnancy before the parents do. It's their child and if they said do not post pictures then that is a boundary you crossed and it sounds like you cannot follow bounderies mixed with the pettiness/self righteousness of your actions leading up to the no contact.

But you CAN be, and it needs to start with personal accountability and responsibility.  You need to own your behavior, without finger pointing or excusing it.  You would probably benefit from some counseling as well. If you change your behavior and outlook on how you view the world, you will have a far better chance of establishing peace and harmony in your family and who knows, maybe an actual meaningful bond with your DIL.

I see it happen more in adulthood when kids bring up things from their childhoods and parents get defensive and don't listen, apologize, or grow. A parent can do their best and still end up hurting a kid without knowing it. The no contact part comes when the kid says \"hey this really messed me up\" and the parent repeatedly denies, gaslights, gets defensive, blames the kid, etc. If a parent meets the kid where they are with grace, listening ears, and a desire to do better and offer an actual apology then they aren't a bad parent. A parent who acts the other way is a bad parent. \n\nThis case seems like Mom wants control of her child even though he is a 30 year old with his own life and family.
