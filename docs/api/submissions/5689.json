That being said, from a budgeting standpoint, I hope you can see how it may have been worth thinking through your gift giving before making these purchases. \n\n4. Most of the embarrassment in your step-father\u2019s side of things came from the fact that you bought nice gifts for your father, a gift for your mother and siblings, and literally nothing for him. It can easily be perceived as flagrant disrespect for him. Even if you bought him something small, the sentiment of gift giving (I hope) would have meant more than the cost of the gift. \n\nThankfully, you can take this as a learning experience and do your best to consider your own budgeting, planning, and sentiment when the next gift-giving opportunity rolls around.

You can show favoritism to whoever you want. If you don't like your mom then fine, if you really like your stepmom that's fine. Just be prepared for the consequences of your actions.

You shared the post, knowing she and her husband would see. She has eyes and can see the expensive watch and expensive necklace. You used her money to buy those gifts, and half-assed a candle for her. I'm sure seeing that post really hurt her feelings, so it makes you TA.", "There is no good way to justify such hurtful actions. You should accept YTA and offer mom & step-dad a sincere apology. This is one of those things you will look back on and regret for many years as the type of hurt you cause, even after an apology, doesn't just go away.", "it was a nice photo", "INFO: how long has your dad been in your life? Does he buy you expensive gifts often? Does he let you do anything you want and rarely punishes you for bad behavior? Do others agree with your mom about his abuse towards her? How long have you lived with your dad?", "So it\u2019s safe to say that buying your father an $850 watch and not buying anything for your step-father was an intentional slap to the face on your part, then, and less about poor budgeting. The fact that it went public is just icing on the pain cake. YTA.", "No, they are upset because you were being openly excluding and favoring your dad/his gf.

Your father was abusive, and is now abusive by proxy (you). You are vile. YTA.", "You should have explained the reasoning for getting your mom such an inexpensive gift compared to your dad and his gf. When you look at this post, the automatic thing I go for is YTA because there's no explanation.", "Because they do the fun stuff with you, while your mom actually patents. YTA for sure go live with you dad and his girlfriend full time.

This kid is knew what she was doing. It's why she told people the price, she knew what was going to happen. She has no chores according to her but gets treated worse than her siblings? Idk if I believe this. Something is not right here. This is either fake altogether or this chick is a clueless asshole. You even say your mom gave you money for these presents. How much did she put in?\n\nETA: Seems like there may be some alienation going on as well. Idk this us just too much.", "I find the disparity in the amount your spent on your dad vs your mom disturbing.\n\nAre you more concerned about your dad's approval than your mom's?", "So why even ask here if your an AH?

Maybe she thought you'd like it, but simply made a mistake? I've bought my girls dresses before, thinking they'd like them, not realising they'd reached a phase of no longer liking dresses. And I live with mine full time. Maybe that's all that's happened here? Did you tell her what you wanted/liked, did you give her any guidance at all? \n\nIf you can't even try to be nice to your mother, I'd suggest going NC and leaving her alone. All you're doing now is hurting her more, no one needs that. But I'd really ask myself if losing her completely would be worth it or not before I did it. It may seem like the right idea in the moment, but crossing that line is huge and shouldn't be done lightly or out of anger. \n\nI hope you find the help you need. And a way back to a good relationship with your mum. \n\nI'll be interested to see how things turn out in a few years when you start rebelling against your dad. How he treats you then. You might sing a different song then. Good luck OP. \nBut for now, YTA.", "You announced it yourself, on social media.", "Well. You are abusive as well to her so you are like him! \n\nAlso everything about this reads like a bad episode of a crime drama where the final outcome of the troll is that \u201cabuse\u201d actually meant SA.

You probably further would have asked dad + gf to play it cool with their gifts and not flaunt them for other family to see on social media, lest it invite unwanted scrutiny by others.\n\nAgain, you got what I think you wanted -- to clearly show extreme preference for your father and his gf over your mother and stepfather.", "3 years\n\nyep\n\nwho my dad? between all of them my dad is the most strict\n\nyeah\n\nabout 3 years", "i never said it was poor budgeting i just didnt care so i bought the gifts i wanted for my dad and his gf and decided to spend whatever is left on mom and her family", "Strange how the child is blamed but not the adults who created this shitstorm.", "i live with my dad so whats your point?", "New low for this sub, a 14 year old is vile and somehow the mother is innocent.", "i live with my dad full time im only here for holiday so no she doesnt PARENT", "Did you read the edit at all ?

Your desperate for your dads attention, approval, validation or whatever bc of the lost time and now that he\u2019s spoiling you and giving your every desire, everything your mother does is shitty and wrong. Once you get into an abusive relationship with someone and have a kid with that person and want to leave for yours and your child\u2019s sake, I hope you understand what your mother went through. She went through all that just for her daughter to paint her as the bad guy bc some bum decided to be a parent after 11 years. Wow. I feel bad for you bc your so easy to manipulate. All your dad had to do was buy you things and make glitter into gold and poof! your moms in the wrong for leaving a man who she thought would hurt her daughter bc he abused her!

Why on gods green dick would your mother tell an abuser she\u2019s carrying his child???
