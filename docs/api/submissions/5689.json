Your cousin didn't *have* to announce it.

That being said, from a budgeting standpoint, I hope you can see how it may have been worth thinking through your gift giving before making these purchases. \n\n4. Most of the embarrassment in your step-father\u2019s side of things came from the fact that you bought nice gifts for your father, a gift for your mother and siblings, and literally nothing for him. It can easily be perceived as flagrant disrespect for him. Even if you bought him something small, the sentiment of gift giving (I hope) would have meant more than the cost of the gift. \n\nThankfully, you can take this as a learning experience and do your best to consider your own budgeting, planning, and sentiment when the next gift-giving opportunity rolls around.

You can show favoritism to whoever you want. If you don't like your mom then fine, if you really like your stepmom that's fine. Just be prepared for the consequences of your actions.

Comments validating OP and telling them their behaviour is justified could also be harmful.", "You\u2019re calling a child who was mistreated by her mother vile because she showed the people who show her love the same love back?

I even looked through Ops comments on old posts and all I see is op talking about how abusive the mom was", "I did. I love people like you who assume others don't read and think that gives them license to be condescending. \n\nOP is an unreliable narrator and she's 14, you can't trust her to know exactly what was going on with her mother's finances her whole life. She's also had her pretty little head stuffed full of \"mum bad, dad good\" bs for the last 3 formative years of her life. \n\nI'd love to have a chat with her in a few years time and see what's what then, but I'm also hoping to forget all about this awful young girl who's probably a troll by the time I wake up tomorrow... so that'll never happen. \n\nHave a good one!", "She's definitely not a little ray of sunshine huh?

Op is horrible.", "According to her mom and her side of the family. But I find it hard to believe from a women who kept  her child from her father and vice versa. Not only did she kept the child away, she abused said child. As someone with a narcissistic mother, and a mother similar to OP, the likelihood of it happening is low. I\u2019m often told different versions of the same story, by families members from both side.", "[deleted]"]}
