We live in London and she is from Finland and had come to the UK for a month with the last 5 days had her staying with us.\nShe got sick on day 3 with a cold and decided she was not well enough to fly home. Fair enough. 5 days later, she is still here (apparently had an open ended ticket).\nI had my brother and sister in law due to stay with us, a week after her origional leaving date but she was making no moves to book tickets home or give us details of flights (we were supposed to get her to the airport).\n \nHusband and I were both frustrated at this point at a number of issues:\n1. She kept reorganising our living space to suit her (she has adhd and apparently how we had things arranged irritated her). \n2. I cooked every night, she picked at the food and didn't eat but sent my husband out at 11pm for noodles because that's what she fancied.\n3. She kept one upping me in conversation, and it felt like she was trying to show herself as a better version of me to my husband.\n4. She didn't offer to pay for food, or help clean up after herself.\n5. We had no personal space, she was sleeping on the sofa all day and then up watching TV all night so we had no space to relax ourselves after work.\n\nI finally had enough and nicely reiterated we needed her gone as we had visitors coming and our house wasn't big enough to house everyone but in all honesty, I feel she would have just kept staying and staying if I hadn't pushed. Husband was reluctant to talk to her about this as he was worried she would twist what happened and he would be ostracised from their mutual friend group. I have no such issue as its his friend group and I'm not particularly involved in things they do.\n\nIt was a very stressful time for us both but things went back to normal after she left.\n\nThe problem is that husband has just approached me asking if she can stay again in the summer while she attends some events.\nI've put my foot down and said no, and he says he will look like an ass as she has no where else to go and can't afford a hotel but I don't want a repeat of earlier this year.\n\nWe are currently disagreeing on how to handle this and I need an outside perspective that I'm not over reacting.", "created_utc": 1677010629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118dwi3/aita_for_saying_my_husbands_friend_cannot_stay/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why did your husband, in fact, not want to ask her to leave?\n\nShow him the list.  Tell him that not only can't she stay, she can't walk over the threshold of your house.", "Your home.

It's not your problem that she can't afford a hotel.", "NTA so you guys were on the same page about her being a bad houseguest while she was there and then afterwards he was all rip roaring ready to schedule another visit? Super sketchy. How did he even meet this woman who is ten years younger than him??? Not that ten years is a terrible age gap for friends but I don't really see how they met being sperated by 10years and country borders haha", "Guests in the house are a clear \"2 yes, 1 no\" kind of situation. If you don't agree with it, she can find somewhere else to stay.", "NTA, she is a bad house guest and her trying to one up you and also not cleaning up after herself, Not liking the food and having your husband go out to get her food in the middle of the night. No just NO. Sometimes you just have to not let the moocher bad house guests in.", "NTA - bad houseguests don't get invited back.  Also, if she can't afford accomodations for a trip, then she can't afford the trip.  That's not your problem.  Someone else in their friend group can put her up.", "NTA. Why does your husband have a female friend a full decade younger than him and why is that female friend so competitive with you and why is your husband so afraid to be direct with his \u201cfriend?\u201d So many questions that all lead me to think you have a husband problem, not a husband\u2019s friend problem.", "NTA and stay your ground!  The friend abused overstayed and abused her welcome before, she's very likely will do so again.", "NTA. You extended your home to her and she was a crappy houseguest. I wouldn't let someone like that come back either. If you don't care about the friend group then let him say you said no and he's not going to fight you over it.", "NTA, this is absurd, she was such a rude guest.

From what I read it seems pretty reasonable that you would feel uncomfortable. \n\nJust asking- did you confronted her directly and tell her to leave at some point? \nI have a britisch brother in law and this guy is very polite and indirect. Is it possible she just didn\u2019t pick up on your cues? Because if that\u2019s the case I would say yta. But if you guys where clear\u2026 well.", "NTA - once bitten never twice", "NTA.

Tell your husband to get a spine, he's more worried about how he looks to his friends than his wife's comfort. His priorities seem pretty screwed up if you ask me.

He doesn't have to be rude about it, he can just say you guys have a lot going on over the summer and aren't able to host people often with all you have going on in your own lives. You aren't an air b&b, this is your home.

She is a bad houseguest. Good guests don\u2019t rearrange the house to suit them.

I wouldn\u2019t really want that person living with me either.\n\nYour husbands group kind of makes or breaks this. How important is the group to him, what benefits are there, that sort of thing. Is letting him be ostracized by the group a big deal or not? Your husband should be on your side for that sort of thing, but if the group is really important to him, then putting up with an annoying person for a week isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n\nI would say NAH, but there\u2019s some nuance", "NAH between you and your husband.

And boundaries. And a spine. He was getting her noodles at 11 PM after you cooked for her? HA. You have a husband problem. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat a crumby guest. Your husband should be on your team.\n\nAlso, this guest can afford the events, but not a hotel? Sounds like she can't afford the events.", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to learn that she was a poor houseguest and burned a bridge", "NTA That woman had no intentions of leaving.. only your impending guests made her move on. She is going to come back and try again because your husband is a pushover. You dodged a bullet this time. Learn your lesson.", "Sounds like a bad friend, you're in the right NTA", "Exactly what I was thinking. If these events are work related she needs to talk to her employers about covering her expenses, but if they\u2019re for her own leisure it sounds like she needs to consider her finances instead of jetting off to another country for vacations.", "I honestly think she is a very manipulative person.  She makes it out she is a weak and feeble woman who can't work and is stuck living in a situation she doesn't want to be in in Finland because she can't afford to move so the friend group all send her money to 'support her'.\nDoing something that doesn't appear supportive to this one person seems to get people the cold shoulder in this group (they're online friends mainly.)", "Online friends.

I told her on the 8th that she needed to have left by the 14th as we had guests coming (she was unaware prior to this as we assumed she would have left by the time they came so why tell her). \nShe left the morning of the 14th after not booking flights until the 12th evening and then she only booked after I reminded her again she would either need to be on a plane or have found alternate accommodation by the 14th.\nI think she hoped we would re arrange our plans in order to let her stay because she kept hinting at it.", "This is my main concern, this group of friends is his main friend group, if he was kicked out or if they gave him the cold shoulder over this it would devestate him.\nOther than me and my friends (who have kind of become mutual friends as he gets on well with my friends husbands) they're his only social circle which is why I'm worrying about it.", "She doesn't work, it's all leisure.", "Just tell your husband to keep it simple.  We have family staying with us at all different times for extended periods this summer.  You\u2019ll have to find accommodations elsewhere.

You\u2019re booked with family visits\u2026..end of story.\nAs an aside, why for the life of me would anyone care about being ostracized by an online group?  What are they going to do?   Ban your husband from the internet?", "Sorry, if your husband needs to keep this awful woman in his home -- which is intolerable to you and should be intolerable to him -- in order to maintain this friend group, let him make some new friends.  His completely reasonable wife should be his priority.  Not this manipulative woman, and not what his friends might or might not think or do.\n\nAnd for God sakes, no money.  None, zero.  Do not spend money.  I'm not sure how your husband got sucked into this, but he needs to get sucked out.

Gotta love it. \n\nStill weird...but he's probably just afraid of making waves...I mean you'd know if that is likely is he usually a little spineless? I'm not trying to be an asshole...

If your husband isn\u2019t the only person in this friend group who lives in your area, couldn\u2019t he suggest Finlandia stay with one of them?  I completely understand your trepidation.

I see two options - stand your ground, refuse to let her stay there, and let him handle it...or you could tell him to just blame you \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don't judge. It's probably what I would do if it wasn't a group of friends I was particularly involved in.", "I understand and you really shouldn't try to control. \nBut you can point to your husband he is being used and how this person is treating him is not how a real friend would treat him. You said he doesn't have many friends and this can led him to not understand what a healthy friendship looks like.", "I am perfectly happy to be considered the bad guy here, I just do not want her in our home again.\nIf that's how he saves face, I don't mind how he does it as long as she doesn't step foot in my home."]}
