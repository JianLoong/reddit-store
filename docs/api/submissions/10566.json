That\u2019d be the end of my marriage. No one deserves that amount of disrespect, and even siblings need boundaries. By not placing those boundaries with her, she feels like she\u2019s winning, in a sense. By not placing boundaries, she feels validated in what she\u2019s doing and she\u2019ll continue to do so.
