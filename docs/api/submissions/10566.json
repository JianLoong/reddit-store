We live in London and she is from Finland and had come to the UK for a month with the last 5 days had her staying with us.\nShe got sick on day 3 with a cold and decided she was not well enough to fly home. Fair enough. 5 days later, she is still here (apparently had an open ended ticket).\nI had my brother and sister in law due to stay with us, a week after her origional leaving date but she was making no moves to book tickets home or give us details of flights (we were supposed to get her to the airport).\n \nHusband and I were both frustrated at this point at a number of issues:\n1. She kept reorganising our living space to suit her (she has adhd and apparently how we had things arranged irritated her). \n2. I cooked every night, she picked at the food and didn't eat but sent my husband out at 11pm for noodles because that's what she fancied.\n3. She kept one upping me in conversation, and it felt like she was trying to show herself as a better version of me to my husband.\n4. She didn't offer to pay for food, or help clean up after herself.\n5. We had no personal space, she was sleeping on the sofa all day and then up watching TV all night so we had no space to relax ourselves after work.\n\nI finally had enough and nicely reiterated we needed her gone as we had visitors coming and our house wasn't big enough to house everyone but in all honesty, I feel she would have just kept staying and staying if I hadn't pushed. Husband was reluctant to talk to her about this as he was worried she would twist what happened and he would be ostracised from their mutual friend group. I have no such issue as its his friend group and I'm not particularly involved in things they do.\n\nIt was a very stressful time for us both but things went back to normal after she left.\n\nThe problem is that husband has just approached me asking if she can stay again in the summer while she attends some events.\nI've put my foot down and said no, and he says he will look like an ass as she has no where else to go and can't afford a hotel but I don't want a repeat of earlier this year.\n\nWe are currently disagreeing on how to handle this and I need an outside perspective that I'm not over reacting.\n\n\nEdited to add:\n\nOK, so this is being asked a lot. \n\nNo I don't believe there is any sort of emotional affair going on. I had suspicions before she came to stay and confronted my husband and talked things out with him. I was satisfied that this is not that.\n\nHowever, I believe this friend likes playing the Damsel in distress. She can't work due to medical issues and says she lives with roommates in Finland in a sucky living situation but can't afford to move out. \nAll the guys in the friend group have been sucked in by this and will support her, sending money and gifts (it's an online friend group that meet in the UK in person one a year). The ladies of the group seem to see right through this.\nI would love my husband to cut this girl out but he can't do that without cutting off the rest of the friend group which he doesn't want to do. \n\nI am happy to be the bad guy and be blamed for why she can't stay - I just don't want her in our home again because it 100% sucked last time.", "created_utc": 1677010629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118dwi3/aita_for_saying_my_husbands_friend_cannot_stay/", "score": 623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
