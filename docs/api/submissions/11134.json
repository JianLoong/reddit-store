Your comments, while true, were likely upsetting for her, especially since she did invite them to the reception later.

We warned her ahead of time that if you do it this way less people are likely to come. Because in the winter kids are in school, many people already have holiday travel planned, and its likely some people will see it as a consolation gift grab vs truly wanting you to celebrate the marriage with them.\n\n Its natural to be more generous for something when you know that your attendance costed the couple a lot of money, and that people who are able will often want to gift more to show appreciation for that.

Often it is, but if you want to show empathy and maintain the relationship, that isn't what you say.  Instead you acknowledge their feelings and withhold judgment, and they feel better because while they can't fix the problem, they at least feel like someone else cares about it.   To be realistic and honest with you, your response is the kind of response that results in adult kids never telling their parents anything of significance in their life unless it's an unqualified success.
