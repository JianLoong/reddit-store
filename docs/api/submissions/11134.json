We have a large extended family but only about 1/3 of the relatives who went to Maddy's wedding attended Jess' event. She also didn't receive nearly as much money gifted.

OP states Maddy got 25K and op know this because Maddy told everyone.

It was also very generous of you to pay for the wedding. Edit: Even though she invited the same people to the reception later, the guest list was still smaller for the wedding proper. Some people might be inclined to give less if they aren't important enough to get an invite to the ceremony itself. \n\nBut don't confuse being accurate with being kind.

It's a NAH or ESH situation in my opinion.\n\nThat said, when it comes down to weddings and gifts I tend to come down on the side that expecting a certain amount from guests is a bit distasteful.

So yes, it was pulled from thin air.\n\nSeems like you might benefit from some understanding of the topic yourself.", "In December though? You're never going to have as many people show in December, it's a busy month.", "So you think these two women\u2019s choices need to be coddled to them by their parents? \n\nNo. The two parties are different, that\u2019s just the reality.", "Wrong, i literally said \u201cif\u201d to show that it wasn\u2019t the scenario occuring, but was walking you through the above commenters logic since there was a disconnect. And no, you used the 20K, i just referenced it to show it matters WHERE that 20k is from. \n\nI understand it must be difficult to be told you misunderstood another persons comment, but take this as a learning opportunity!", "I think their parents are more invested in the types of weddings and which kid they went to than they are saying. Idk, just based on how they describe the daughters. I don\u2019t think they should be coddled but I also don\u2019t think the parents acted in anybody\u2019s best interest but their own here tbh."]}
