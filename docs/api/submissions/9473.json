It\u2019s not uncommon at weddings I\u2019ve been to for newborns to be excluded from the ceremony, but allowed at the reception (the cutoff has usually been non-mobile kids only, if they\u2019re crawling/running around they come under the \u201cno kids allowed\u201d category). Theory being that a crying baby can really disrupt a ceremony, even if it\u2019s rushed out the back, but a reception is more relaxed and people tend to be coming and going a bit more anyway so it\u2019s less disruptive to have a baby there. \nIf you\u2019re ok with that, you could talk with her about what arrangements could be made - finding a room at/near the ceremony location where someone could stay with baby whilst SIL attends the ceremony, maybe even extending an extra invite to her so if it\u2019s a family member or close friend who she asks to babysit, they could come to the reception after (often it\u2019s someone on the other side of the family that\u2019s called - eg in this case her husbands family, who have no other connection to your wedding so won\u2019t mind missing the ceremony). \nOther option could be she just comes to reception with baby.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d only go with option 2 if you and OH are comfortable with it, and if it means a lot to one of you that she attends AND you think she\u2019ll respect the compromise and follow it. \n\nHowever, if she\u2019s got an attitude of I\u2019m going to do whatever I want anyway, then I wouldn\u2019t bother compromising, no matter what you do she\u2019ll complain about it and make it all about her, so you may as well save yourself the headache and draw your line in the sand and stick to it.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding. A newborn doesn't belong at such an event. What so it can cry through the whole ceremony? The child doesn't want to be at some \"boring\" wedding anyway. They want to play, nap, and do baby stuff.\n\nShe's being very selfish. I think she can manage a babysitter for 1 night especially if her other child already has a sitter. Just give them more cash and instructions. \n\nDon't be surprised if she just doesn't come at all and blame you.", "Put her and the baby in a room and her watch it by video and eat later.

Completely respect your decision though. \n\nIf she is nursing she\u2019d either be leaving periodically to pump or find baby to nurse. I know I wouldn\u2019t be drinking knowing I\u2019m going home to a baby that little. So all the joys of attending a child free wedding would basically be lost on her anyway. \n\nAt that age all they do is eat and sleep.

He also talked to his sister/gave her some options.  \n\nI guess I\u2019m looking at SIL\u2019s reaction is her initial one and coming from a place of assuming newborn would be different. Just like my MIL\u2019s reaction was her initial one and she assumed an exepction for daughter.\n\nIf SIL keeps pushing it and shows up, she\u2019d be the AH.", "I'm saying some venues have a separate room available, and if there's somebody who wants to come along to provide childcare that can be done. We've done it for plenty of big parties. Not a daycare. Just a babysitter hired for the occasion. \n\nEither way, it is what it is. If she doesn't want an infant at her wedding, that's her prerogative. She doesn't have to accommodate. SIL is the one who unceremoniously announced she'd be bringing an infant to a child free wedding regardless of what the bride and groom requested. SIL doesn't just get a pass for everything because she had a baby.", "Then I think it\u2019s fair enough to ask your sister not to attend if she doesn\u2019t want to leave your nephew/ niece. However, Reddit will say you are NTA but very few people in your real life will agree. \n\nI think it\u2019s very unkind to exclude a person you care about, especially a family member when she\u2019s probably already not feeling herself. People who care about their friends and family make exceptions and they do it graciously. \n\nYou should have your dream wedding but you are also publicly announcing that you do not care for your sister.", "I went to two child free weddings last year and both had a baby \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "For her husband\u2019s sister?! That seems heartless", "Pumping milk can definitely be a big deal. A breast pump is not as efficient as a baby at removing milk. And if the SIL isn't pumping already, then it would be a HUGE deal to try to do so for this one event. And there's no guarantee that a nursing baby will accept a bottle either. \n\nOP isn't the AH. SIL should just decline if she doesn't want to be away from her newborn. That's the only reasonable solution here.", "Actually as someone who has exclusively breastfed two kids, and soon to be a third-this is wrong. MANY women do not respond to pumps. Many more barely make enough milk for their babies and the idea that you're going to pump enough in advance to sustain them is not realistic at all. My first daughter was exclusively breastfed BECAUSE she was unwilling to take a bottle ever. Her baby SHOULD be the exception because she needs to eat. She certainly has a right to say too bad, IDGAF exactly like she is but that doesn't mean she's NTA. She absolutely is.", "Not every nursing mother is capable of being hooked up to a machine and being pumped like a cow. \n\nI exclusively nurses all three of my children. I never could successfully pump. My milk would not let down for a machine no matter what I tried. \n\nNipple confusion is also an issue that occurs with young nursing infants because a bottle is always easier than a breast. \n\nMany exclusively breast fed infants are never given a bottle for this reason. Two of my kids never took one and went right to cups. \n\nA two month old, without colic, is not going to scream. They get fussy and root, as long as they are removed quickly, no screams. \n\nOP is entitled to a child free wedding but to act like the SIL can leave her 2month old behind for several hours is ignorant if she is nursing. \n\nA bottled fed infant is a different situation.", "A lot of people in this thread A: don't understand why someone would want a childfree party and B: seem to think babies are magical and won't scream if they're young enough to need milk.", "You understand... not everyone responds to a pump?.  My cousin breastfed 4 babies but couldn't get a drop out using a pump.", "Well that\u2019s fine, but a wedding is one day and a relationship with your sister is for a lifetime.", ">I really can't sorry. I don't want the sound of a baby interrupting one of the biggest days of my life.\n\nWHAAA WHAAA I'm afraid a withthwe baby wiww ruin my shpeciaw day", "It\u2019s weird to read that you view your own family, because this baby isn\u2019t just some kid, it\u2019s your niece, as \u2018not my problem\u2019. Of course it\u2019s not your problem, but it you make it your sisters problem you might have no sister at your wedding. \n\nI get a child free wedding. I don\u2019t get talking this way about your own family members, no matter their age. \nNo other human is \u2018your problem\u2019 but I would want my close family comfortable and relaxed at my wedding. And knowing my sister would have to leave such a young child and be uncomfortable wouldn\u2019t feel good and my sister not attending because of my rule wouldn\u2019t feel good either. \n\nWould you rather have her with you and at easy or not have her attend or attend and be not at ease because she has to leave her newborn at home? Not \u2018your problem\u2019 at all. Sure. But most of the time it helps treating others friendly instead of \u2018my rules not my problem\u2019", "Question: Can you offer her an another option? Like hiring a babysitter to be on the premises with the newborn during the ceremony and reception? That way SIL could pop out to do feedings and then come back at her leisure?\n\nThis is tough because no one should feel bad about being a new mom and not being able to leave their newborn but they should still respect the wishes of the bride and groom. Giving her a way to keep her baby close by but not in the ceremony/reception is a reasonable compromise. If she balks at that, then she's being the AH. But not trying to reach a compromise and essentially leaving her out of the wedding (because I can't imagine she'll be able to come otherwise) would make you the AH.", ">Working women leave their infants at day care all day long, five days a week.\n\n\nYeah but daycare isn't recommended before the age of three. This is a literal two month old baby we're talking about, it's still nursing.", "He's actually on the same page with me. His sister unfortunately has a bit of a history doing and saying things without taking into consideration totality of the situation so, he's frustrated we've been put in this position. He very much wants a child-free wedding.", "A two-month-old can 10000% absolutely be separated from mom for a few hours lol. I wouldn\u2019t blame her for choosing to stay home anyways, but comparing this to disability accommodations is wild. Many moms go back to work after a month or two of maternity leave (myself included), I guess the baby just starves then?", "It's not an affirmative decision to exclude her. The SIL would need to find a sitter for ONE EVENING. Women pump breast milk which can then be fed to the baby from a bottle. Many women who breast feed actually practice this so that they can leave the baby home for an occasional evening out or at daycare so they can go to work. OP is not asking anything totally outrageous. If the SIL feels she cannot do that then the decision not to attend is on her.", "Interesting! I appreciate your perspective. Unfortunately it was more of a statement from her versus a request or discussion which was disappointing and perhaps has fueled a lot of my annoyance.", "Exactly this!!", "comparing being a new parent to having a disability is ridiculous and offensive, i can't leave my disability with a babysitter, nor did i choose to have it in the first place", "This...", "like i\u2019m glad y\u2019all got some quiet newborns but that surely isn\u2019t the norm when the only way they can communicate is by crying? so baby\u2019s gonna cry, it\u2019s literally their survival method \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah, but all 2 month olds that I know, would be attached to their parents full time. It\u2019s just what human baby\u2019s do. I can totally see why the SIL figured the infant would be an exception, because they\u2019re hardly a separate person by that age. \n\nSo you can totally not want the baby there, but since the baby is probably stuck to their parents, so that means the parents won\u2019t come either. Especially if the baby is breastfed. If that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not a problem.", "Yeah, this. I admit I don't understand the point of a wedding if you exclude people you love who are an important part of your life because the aesthetic of a child-free wedding is more important than their presence. People here will say not the asshole: your wedding, your rules. People IRL will rightly feel YTA and may hold grudges about being excluded or seeing you make decisions that exclude other people they love. So think about your priorities. What's more important? Having your fiance's sister there or making sure nobody brings a \\*newborn\\*?", "Seems they were not childfree then. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If the SIL can't do it then she shouldn't attend. It just sounds like she is not looking for options that would allow her to attend without the baby.", "Just because some women and babies have an issue with pumping and bottle feeding doesn't mean all do. I am pointing this out as an option that millions of women have used and SIL could possibly use to attend the wedding. If the SIL isn't able or is unwilling to do this and leave the baby then she shouldn't attend the wedding. OP and her fiance have the right to have the type of wedding they want. SIL is being a diva.", ">A lot of people in this thread A: don't understand why someone would want a childfree party \n\n\nWell it is pretty rude to exclude children from a family celebration. It's not a stag night, it's a wedding. \n\n\n>B: seem to think babies are magical and won't scream if they're young enough to need milk.\n\n\nSo what? Why does it bother someone if a baby screams?

Never assume that of any woman or baby", "How many newborns have you bottle trained?  I've done it with one, and it was easily the most horrifying thing I've done to either of my children.  Asking for that to be done for a wedding is fucking ridiculous.\n\nThey are disinviting, but that doesn't make them AHs because it isn't out of spite.\n\nEDIT: Let me add, they are both circumcised.", "Right??", "My old unit back in the military used to swap childcare with other units for holiday parties. We'd literally have a room set off to the side with all the kids. There were small babies, if they got fussy we'd take them to mom or mom came in regularly to check on them throughout the duration of the party. They are usually only 4-5 hours anyways, it's not like it's days on end. \n\nI mean, everybody wants to \"yeahbut\" OP here but OP is literally footing the bill for this and SIL is just dictating what she is going to do, regardless of what OP and her future husband want. \n\nDon't go if your baby can't be separated from you, end of story. Not always awesome, but it is what it is. That's part of having kids.", "This is pretty much one of the nightmare scenarios of childfree weddings. It's an extremely close family member with a very fresh new baby that absolutely can't be babysat and kept away for hours. Mother and baby HAVE to come together, you can't really separate them for this or get a sitter. So it's either put up with baby inevitably crying or disinvite the groom's sister, and both options suck/make someone mad.\n\nThe only saving grace is if SIL is the sort who would take her baby into another room if it's crying...but perhaps she's not that sort.", "I'm not gonna go back and forth, you're entitled to your opinion. I would caution the bride to realize however that at least half of her new extended family is indeed going to see her as the asshole for all the reasons listed above and more.  Sounds like she doesn't particularly care, which leads me to the conclusion she is in fact TA.", "I put her in the position of being pregnant? I'm not following.", "How so? She didn't get her SIL pregnant. And it would be highly irresponsible on SIL's part to bring a 2-month-old with an underdeveloped immune system to a wedding full of people. The SIL herself had a child-free wedding, so she should be well aware of how such events go. It's well within OP's right to enforce her own child-free wedding, and SIL sounds entitled for thinking she is an exception to such rules. And it's not OP's responsibility to figure out any childcare arrangements - that is on the PARENTS OF THE CHILD, i.e. SIL and her husband. \n\nOP - you are NTA.", "We can\u2019t assume SIL will breastfeed. October is so far away, we can\u2019t be sure of anything regarding how baby will eat. SIL can have a preference, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee it will go down that way. \n\nI have a three month old currently, and even if she was welcome at a wedding I can not imagine actually taking her. That sounds like a pretty bad time for everyone. Add in international travel and all those germs, no thank you.", "Its a little outrageous to call bottle training horrifying.    I just left and they ate when they were hungry.  Maybe my two are the exception.", "I bottle trained my son because he wouldn't latch to my titty. I pumped and went to work 2 weeks after my c-section. Daddy and Grandpa could bottle feed him that all natural titty-milk no problem.", "Jesus no one is saying she HAS to bottle train for a wedding. It would be fine if she stays home, neither OP or her husband said they\u2019d mind. But the original user\u2019s comment that a newborn can\u2019t be separated from its mother is just untrue, many people bottle train (not because of a single event lol) and most who do don\u2019t find it \u201chorrifying\u201d", "You put her in the position of having to choose between you and her infant.\n\nShe worked things out with a babysitter for her toddler, so that should demonstrate how willing she is to go with your child-free wedding.\n\nI had a child-free wedding technically.

Her baby was less rowdy than some of our adult guests, and my cousin was able to enjoy my wedding with her newborn and they went home for bedtime.", "I do think she was rude to tell you she was bringing her baby instead of asking but you can\u2019t expect people not to get pregnant cause of a wedding, dude.", "I'm happy it went well for you.  Not all kids are the same.", "This is unusual, yes. I know far more breastfed babies who wouldn\u2019t touch a bottle than the other way around.\n\nOne of my friends wishes she could combination feed her baby, but he will not take any kind of bottle or open cup or sippy cup or spoon or syringe. When he wants milk he wants it from the source. Frustratingly for my friend, he will sip water from a cup, but he can\u2019t be left for hours with only water, he\u2019s young enough that his main source of nutrition is breastmilk.\n\nAll three of my babies refused bottles and would get hungrier and hungrier and angrier angrier but still wouldn\u2019t give in.", "Again...people all make choices in life. I'm so excited for her and I'm looking forward to having another niece/nephew, but her having a newborn...is simply not something that should impact me this much and it is, on literally the one day I think you can be selfish - your wedding. I disagree with you of me putting her in this position. We all envision our weddings a certain way and mine happens to be without children including babies. I also am surprised only one person has brought up the health risks of having such a small infant around 100+ people? I evidently don't know a lot about babies, but there are many elements of the way she (and others evidently) are approaching this scenario that doesn't compute in my brain."]}
