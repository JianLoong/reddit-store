It\u2019s not uncommon at weddings I\u2019ve been to for newborns to be excluded from the ceremony, but allowed at the reception (the cutoff has usually been non-mobile kids only, if they\u2019re crawling/running around they come under the \u201cno kids allowed\u201d category). Theory being that a crying baby can really disrupt a ceremony, even if it\u2019s rushed out the back, but a reception is more relaxed and people tend to be coming and going a bit more anyway so it\u2019s less disruptive to have a baby there. \nIf you\u2019re ok with that, you could talk with her about what arrangements could be made - finding a room at/near the ceremony location where someone could stay with baby whilst SIL attends the ceremony, maybe even extending an extra invite to her so if it\u2019s a family member or close friend who she asks to babysit, they could come to the reception after (often it\u2019s someone on the other side of the family that\u2019s called - eg in this case her husbands family, who have no other connection to your wedding so won\u2019t mind missing the ceremony). \nOther option could be she just comes to reception with baby.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d only go with option 2 if you and OH are comfortable with it, and if it means a lot to one of you that she attends AND you think she\u2019ll respect the compromise and follow it. \n\nHowever, if she\u2019s got an attitude of I\u2019m going to do whatever I want anyway, then I wouldn\u2019t bother compromising, no matter what you do she\u2019ll complain about it and make it all about her, so you may as well save yourself the headache and draw your line in the sand and stick to it.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding. A newborn doesn't belong at such an event. What so it can cry through the whole ceremony? The child doesn't want to be at some \"boring\" wedding anyway. They want to play, nap, and do baby stuff.\n\nShe's being very selfish. I think she can manage a babysitter for 1 night especially if her other child already has a sitter. Just give them more cash and instructions. \n\nDon't be surprised if she just doesn't come at all and blame you.", "Put her and the baby in a room and her watch it by video and eat later.

Completely respect your decision though. \n\nIf she is nursing she\u2019d either be leaving periodically to pump or find baby to nurse. I know I wouldn\u2019t be drinking knowing I\u2019m going home to a baby that little. So all the joys of attending a child free wedding would basically be lost on her anyway. \n\nAt that age all they do is eat and sleep.

All the parents of young children were thrilled to have a night away from the kids, as you described.\n\nI, on the other hand, got married at a summer camp and all invitations were to entire households. I loved having all the kids around and watching them on the climbing wall or playing in the lake in the afternoon before the ceremony. They were all very well behaved during the ceremony and dinner. I think most went to bed before the dancing part of the reception (most guests stayed in the cabins on-site) but I think they all enjoyed the parts they were there for. One friend's kid, who was 3 at the time, still sometimes asks when they can go back to that camp.\n\nPoint being - it's fine to want the kind of wedding you want!

So if grandma is attending, she isn't available to watch SIL's kids so SIL can go. All of SILs family is invited too so that's out. You don't really want to trust young children under 4 with teenagers so you have to search around for an adult you trust to watch the kids. Some people have them and some people don't. A lot of parents with young children would be uncomfortable leaving their kid with an adult stranger for a few hours. So while it shouldn't be a big deal, the logistics of care is a big deal. Plus that baby sitter could cost over $100 depending on how far away the wedding is and how long. So now your family has to fork over $100 to attend your wedding.\n\nAll I'm saying is that if a couple wants a child free wedding of their dreams then they should have their child free wedding of their dreams, but don't be shocked if people decline to come or complain about the arrangements they had to pay for to accommodate yours wishes.

If you can\u2019t swing it for a wedding that\u2019s fine, sometimes parenthood isn\u2019t conductive with everything, but don\u2019t be upset that people don\u2019t want a newborn at the ceremony.", "You are absolutely not in the minority on this.

If I couldn't bring my toddler or young child somewhere but then someone else had their newborn, I wouldn't think \"why did THEY get an exception and not ME?\" It's not about that parent getting something I didn't get, because bringing a newborn is so different from bringing even a slightly older baby.\n\nI'm not saying OP has to allow the baby (though if I were future SIL, I might then decide I just couldn't make it at all), I just don't think the argument about fairness is relevant.

OP does not say she banned a newborn from her wedding but wants her newborn included. A 2-month-old feeds every 1 1/2 to 2 hours, and a baby that smallmay not be able to switch easily from breast to bottle for a day. I think it\u2019s going overboard to ban her.

She can print out every reply from people who agree with her and show it to them, it's probably not going to have any effect on their opinion. \n\nWhat she really needs to do is weigh up those relationships and whether having a completely childfree wedding (as many childfree weddings allow infants who can't be separated from their mothers and nobody blinks an eye) is more important to her than that.", ">Except most childfree events still allow nursing babies.\n\nNo, they don't.

It kind of feels like you have to pee really bad, but you can't. After that, it becomes actively painful. You also start leaking milk through your clothes. You can develop infections if you are not able to empty your breasts regularly enough. Someone else at the party asking, how's your baby? Can be enough for your milk to let down and become instantly painful.\n\nSo even leaving aside the logistical difficulties of leaving a newborn with a sitter, It's kind of like hosting a lengthy event and informing everyone they will not be allowed to use the bathroom at all during the event, no matter what. Only it's worse, because you're asking the mother of the newborn to be the only one suffering pain from a bodily function they cannot relieve or control, with possible consequences for her health and the health of the baby.\n\nGenerally when I had newborns I did not attend weddings with them, because what a hassle. But if it is your sibling getting married and you have a newborn, you're kind of expected to be there, so there kind of needs to be a newborn exception.\n\nIf this woman were saying you can't use your wheelchair during my wedding because it will ruin the pictures or you can't take insulin during my wedding because I don't believe in diabetes, we would all agree this person is literally insane. But she's making a similar request about the sister-in-law's health and refusing to let her perform a necessary act of biology.\n\nNow, if her goal is to exclude her sister-in-law, that's fine, mission accomplished. But if she actually expects her sister-in-law to attend, she needs to understand the sister-in-law has a unique medical need right now that is easiest to meet by just bringing the baby.\n\nI realize it's weird because your medical need is involving a second person who is very small. But the biological imperatives around lactating breasts are not really very different from the biological imperatives around a bladder. Except that you can pee anywhere, while milk generally needs to be removed mechanically either by baby or by pump or sometimes by hand, and you do not have conscious control over when you start lactating or leaking milk."]}
