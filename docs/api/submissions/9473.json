It\u2019s not uncommon at weddings I\u2019ve been to for newborns to be excluded from the ceremony, but allowed at the reception (the cutoff has usually been non-mobile kids only, if they\u2019re crawling/running around they come under the \u201cno kids allowed\u201d category). Theory being that a crying baby can really disrupt a ceremony, even if it\u2019s rushed out the back, but a reception is more relaxed and people tend to be coming and going a bit more anyway so it\u2019s less disruptive to have a baby there. \nIf you\u2019re ok with that, you could talk with her about what arrangements could be made - finding a room at/near the ceremony location where someone could stay with baby whilst SIL attends the ceremony, maybe even extending an extra invite to her so if it\u2019s a family member or close friend who she asks to babysit, they could come to the reception after (often it\u2019s someone on the other side of the family that\u2019s called - eg in this case her husbands family, who have no other connection to your wedding so won\u2019t mind missing the ceremony). \nOther option could be she just comes to reception with baby.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d only go with option 2 if you and OH are comfortable with it, and if it means a lot to one of you that she attends AND you think she\u2019ll respect the compromise and follow it. \n\nHowever, if she\u2019s got an attitude of I\u2019m going to do whatever I want anyway, then I wouldn\u2019t bother compromising, no matter what you do she\u2019ll complain about it and make it all about her, so you may as well save yourself the headache and draw your line in the sand and stick to it.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding. A newborn doesn't belong at such an event. What so it can cry through the whole ceremony? The child doesn't want to be at some \"boring\" wedding anyway. They want to play, nap, and do baby stuff.\n\nShe's being very selfish. I think she can manage a babysitter for 1 night especially if her other child already has a sitter. Just give them more cash and instructions. \n\nDon't be surprised if she just doesn't come at all and blame you.", "Put her and the baby in a room and her watch it by video and eat later.

Completely respect your decision though. \n\nIf she is nursing she\u2019d either be leaving periodically to pump or find baby to nurse. I know I wouldn\u2019t be drinking knowing I\u2019m going home to a baby that little. So all the joys of attending a child free wedding would basically be lost on her anyway. \n\nAt that age all they do is eat and sleep.

Babysitting is expensive and people with small children don\u2019t necessarily want to be apart from them for the best part of a day.

We\u2019re going to this effort and expense because we want to support the bride and groom and celebrate with them, but our children *are* more important and our priority.
