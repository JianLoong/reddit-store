You want the relationships with your family and friends to be transformative, to give for the sake of love and that's how you gain. If it's otherwise, you have a right to step away. That's not a family relationship, that's a business one. My brother blew up at my mom over this about 10 years ago. He told her to not contact him on his personal phone as she doesn't want a personal relationship and that the only thing she talks about is money. She was really mad about that, but everyone agreed with my brother so she got better for a bit. She's still not as bad, at least to me, but my brother thinks otherwise. I think she's trying harder with me, but because of my cptsd, I've been a lot more irritable with her lately. And yes, some of the symptoms of my mental illnesses include issues with self esteem and worthlessness. I also have regular anxiety attacks on my birthdays. Haven't worked all my issues out with her yet, because it takes time and a lot of work. Right now, I love her enough to want to make it work.

I'm currently in Japan while every one of my friends and family are back in the USA. Our New Years aren't even the same, but I still received calls and texts from them during my and their New Years.", "we are not in the '80s anymore.

Yeah NTA.", "I get how that can hurt, but I wouldn't think too much of a 6 year-old's actions especially nowadays. He might of just had a video or show he wanted to get back to. I know when my sister was younger she always wants to get calls with the relatives over quickly so she can get back to playing on her 3DS. The rest of your family though, that is a different story.", "Ok well, you wrote 6m. But either way 6 years is still not unusual for children to be uninterested. Your whole rant screams Me! Me! Me!", "So they didn't celebrate your birthday every year, as you said in the post? Or they just didn't make it special enough for you on your 31st?\n\n>it\u2019s that nobody thought to include me in the family dynamic.\n\nYou called them. How do you know they wouldn't have called you at some point in the day? \n\nIf you want to be part of the family celebration, be there.

Then he called her. That's not being ghosted!\n\n>Whenever we have family occasions with someone missing we always do a group FT to say hi and send our love.

Just because you see it as the proof of love, it doesn't make it true for everyone.\n\n>I can totally get why he is hurt and blocking them. It's a typical 'they're not that into him'.\n\nSounds to me like a 44 year old man acting like a bratty teenager.", "7 is not when the day is almost over. \n\nHe then proceeded to call her (both times), so she didn't need to call him.

Take care and hug!", "I'm a little confused.  They didn't reach out to you for Thanksgiving or Christmas.  Ok, they were wrong.  But did you reach out to them?  Did you call your parents or siblings to see if you were invited for Thanksgiving or Christmas?  Or were you waiting for a special invitation?

Family sucks sometimes", "Esh - should they put in more effort? Sure. Could you also call them first? Absolutely.

I get texts or calls from every family member on my birthday, my mom usually facetimes. We facetime each other on Thanksgiving.

And to top it off, my family and I aren\u2019t that close. We don\u2019t talk about feelings or a lot of stuff going on in our lives at all. I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you what their hobbies are and I don\u2019t even know exactly what my older brother does for work (something with investments? I think?)
