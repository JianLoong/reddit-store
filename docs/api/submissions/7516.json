All because she was selfish and wouldn't accommodate to her kid like she should have to begin with. All she said was \"Well, sucks that you feel that way\" and hung up the phone. After she told me she tried with me and I didn't reciprocate simply because she had \"boundaries\".

And have you been in counseling the whole time?", "It sounds like it\u2019s your father who is \u201cmiserable and alone\u201d.  Now that he\u2019s depressed too, maybe you should get him an emotional support dog. \n \nBut your mom sounds like she\u2019s doing fine.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is right.\n\nA parent should not \"have to\" accommodate to a kid in an unreasonable amount like this. But outside of that, let's say that you really do NEED an emotional support animal, and specifically a dog for that matter.\n\nYour mom made it clear to both you and your father that she does not want another dog in the home. So when her opinion is entirely disregarded, she did one of the most mature things she could in the situation. She did not kill your dog, or give it up, or yell at you, or anything like that. She left for her own well-being which was overruled.\n\nBesides all of that, how could you blame your mother for what your father is going through? A relationship is a two-way street. If your dad cannot respect your mom, why would you expect her to cater to him and both of your wants, let alone respect him back?\n\nYour mom even gave you a chance last time in getting a dog, that alone should tell you a lot.\n\nShe didn't ruin your life. It is terrible that you would tell her that, and that she would be alone forever. You should call her and apologize, your girlfriend is right that both you and your dad are being toxic. You are acting entitled. \n\nDogs are not the only options for support animals, and one drug is not the only treatment for depression. Instead of exploring the alternatives, you and your dad just treated your mom like her feelings and needs do not matter. Now you're upset about it? Good. This is a lesson both you and your father need.", "God almighty I feel sorry for your Mum. She had boundaries and you had other ways of dealing with things, and you and your Dad ran roughshod over her. Can't help but feel you both bought this on yourselves and have no one else to blame. YTA", "Sounds like the dog was the straw that broke the relationship.  There were obviously problems before the dog issue.  To me it sounds like there was a history of your dad ignoring your moms feelings.  There are other ways of dealing with depression besides taking meds or getting a dog.  Those aren\u2019t the only two options.  You and your dad should have explored all those options before getting a dog your mom clearly didn\u2019t want.  YTA", "Funny, isn't it? Your mom may be alone, but she doesn't sound miserable. She sounds like she was probably miserable for a couple of decades caring for a dog she didn't want, and was unwilling to do it again. She perhaps also believes that while an emotional support dog may be a valuable add-on to therapy and medication, it probably can't take the place of, IDK, ssris for the treatment of serious depression. \n\nThose friends who are telling you that you and your dad are toxic and selfish? I think they're right. YTA.", "YTA. Your mum sounds like she spent years being ignored and shit on. I'm sorry she didn't want to get you a dog but really, that isn't the worst thing in the world. I have manic depression and severe panic disorder, it sucks big time, but it isn't anyone else's fault. \n\nYour dad made his own bed, she told him if he ignored her needs again then she would go and that's what she did. She is not responsible for the place he's in now, HE IS.\n\nIt also sounds like shes tried to maintain a relationship with you and you've refused that which must be incredibly painful for her. I get that you were 17 when this happened but you're an adult now. It's time to practice empathy and start seeing things from her point of view. Maybe therapy for the two of you together would be a good idea.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t need the dog, but you pretty much demanded one and your dad sided with you. In my opinion, it\u2019s yours and your dad\u2018s fault that your mom left. She explicitly said she did not want another dog in the house, but neither of you cared, so she left. It\u2019s not her fault that your dad ruined his own life after she left. there\u2019s other things to try between medication and getting an emotional support dog. She said what she would do when she stuck to her word. You can\u2019t be mad at her for your dad\u2019s choices after she left. Honestly, you had no right to call her and tell her she would be miserable and alone forever.", "YTA. Frankly you don\u2019t sound depressed, you sound like you\u2019re a label I can\u2019t put here. But you\u2019ve:\n1. Lacked any empathy towards your mother\n2. Acted completely selfishly\n3. Reacted aggressively, manipulatively, and unremorsefully \n4. Failed to understand why you\u2019re the AH \n\nDude you SERIOUSLY need therapy. Not just for possible depression, but for other issues as well.", "YTA.  You demanded a dog and got it. You and your father made her unwelcome in her home and were manipulative.  Of course she wouldn't want to interact with people who don't care how she feels.", "YTA.  You decided on a treatment method that gave you what you desired(a dog), when there are plenty of other treatment methods(ex. exercise, therapy, light therapy, yoga, etc)you could have utilized.  You enforced an animal on a person you knew disliked them in her own home.  You then got your dad to help weaponize your position. Your mom also has no control over your dad or his behavior.  She chose to leave because neither of you respected her opinions or feelings(and, as she said, she had already accommodated a dog she didn't want for 19 years).\n\nIf you wanted a dog, you should have gotten one when you independently lived on your own.  Also, asking to not bring a dog to her home is completely rational.  You should be able to function without your dog for a few hours.  If not, you should work with a counselor since you will outlive your dog and there will be instances when your dog can not join you.  You need to be able to function when those things happen.", "YTA.  Glad your mom got out and is living her life.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve waited to get a dog when you moved out. Instead you guys selfishly brought an animal into the house\u2026. It was her home and she set a boundary and you broke it. Just shows you\u2019re selfish enough to destroy your family over something that could\u2019ve waited. You\u2019re 21??? Why haven\u2019t you moved out and gotten a dog instead of this?", "YTA , good for your mom. Give that dog to your dad, sounds like he needs it.", "YTA- Your mother didn\u2019t destroy your family. She put boundaries down and YOU and YOUR FATHER didn\u2019t care. She was sick of being walked over by not being listen to about not wanting dogs. Don\u2019t blame her for this when it\u2019s on you and your father.", "YTA and at 17/18 yo were too old to throw tantrums to get your own way.\nYour father made his own decision knowing your mother's boundaries and now he's dealing with the consequences. \nAnd, btw, being alone doesn't mean she's miserable.  For some people, being alone is the happiest way to be.", "YTA. I\u2019ve been depressed since I was 8, I have tried basically every anti-depressant out there, and they either didn\u2019t work, or gave me horrible side-effects. It took me 22 years to find one that works. I\u2019d like to think I know a thing or two about depression.\n\n1) being depressed doesn\u2019t make you entitled to a pet.\n2) being depressed doesn\u2019t make your needs greater than everyone else\u2019s.\n3) being depressed is not an excuse to be selfish.\n\nYou and your father pushed her away, by showing her time and time again, that dogs were more important than her. You finally have what you want, congratulations.", "I\u2019m genuinely amazed you could type all this out and not realize YTA", "YTA. You could\u2019ve gotten an emotional support turtle. Or hamster. Or parakeet. It didn\u2019t need to be a dog. you made absolutely no effort to think outside of the box. Your poor mom \u2014 frankly you and your dad deserve each other.", "YTA. You and your Dad didn\u2019t appreciate your mother.  You probably don\u2019t even have the slightest clue of what she has given up for you.  Even now you are blaming her for your father\u2019s problems even though he is an adult who is capable of seeking help.  And by the way\u2026.I hope your Mom is now living her best life.  Sorry dude but I am pretty sure she\u2019s not missing the mess she escaped from.  Reminds me of a saying I recently saw\u2026..\u201dWhen a woman leaves you for herself she won\u2019t be back\u201d.", "YTA, coming from someone who recently lost a Mother. It\u2019s an incredible bond you can only have with a mother and you are also throwing that away over \u201cjust a dog\u201d \nI\u2019m a big animal lover as well and I firmly believe they are also family. But as heartbroken as I\u2019d be, I\u2019d give up any dog to see my mother again. And not to mention your poor father.", "YTA.  I think this is one of those things, where it wasn\u2019t about the dog but your dad constantly undermining her.  It\u2019s not your place to get involved in why their relationship fell apart.\n\nI do, also, think that you\u2019re exaggerating.  You said your mom never talked to you again but then she invited you to Christmas.", "YTA - I love dogs. Have two. Dogs **can** help alleviate symptoms of depression but they do not treat the underlying cause of depression. Your stance that the only thing that would fix your depression (news flash, it didn't) is an ESA is really just you being manipulative. $5 says that if your mom had stayed in the house you would've used your depression as an excuse to foist all the responsibility for caring for and training the dog off on her.", "YTA. this one was a tough read, first of all I wanna say I\u2019m sorry you went through this. As a teenager I was in almost an identical spot where medications did nothing for me and it\u2019s an awful place to be.\n\nEveryone\u2019s already covered the other bases, so I\u2019m just here to mention one point. The whole \u201cmy dog wasn\u2019t invited so I\u2019m not invited\u201d thing seems like a blatant misread- you literally said that she hates dogs. Of course she\u2019s not going to want the dog that ended her marriage in her home if she doesn\u2019t already like them. It sounds like you\u2019re already convinced she\u2019s a bad person before she even acts.", "YTA if your depression is that bad then you need therapy, not a dog", "YTA. Support animals aren't the only possible way to help with depression, especially when one of your family is intensely uncomfortable about it (edit - and especially when it wasn't suggested by any sort of health professional), and if you think your parents got divorced purely over that one dog thing then I've got a bridge to sell you", "YTA\n\nShe didn't leave him because of the dog itself. The dog represents her saying \"I don't want to live that kind of life\" and your father not listening", "Yta. Because you wanted to force your mom to accept a dog and when she was firm you decided to blame everything on her.Your dad's depression is his own issue and it's not your mother's fault so stop blaming her and even though you wanted a dog to deal with your depression your mother has a right not to want to deal with dogs. You don't have to like it and in your household you can have one. You and your dad made choices on what you wanted. Your mother made a life choice based on what she wanted. You want her to be alone and miserable because she didn't want a stupid dog you teied to force on her. Now you're throwing tantrums you didn't get what you wanted the way you wanted. Instead of a dog you need therapy and medication. Youre toxic and immature. grow the f up", "YTA - i feel bad for your mother but happy she got out. You both sound like you treated her pretty horribly. \n\nRegarding the dog, you just decided you wanted a dog and your mom said no. She\u2019s allowed to not want a dog and you made it into a huge issue.", "YTA. \n\nLet this be a lesson moving forward in your own life. Your father will now have to deal with things his own way. \n\nOh yeah, if you're interested in salvageing your relationship with your mom, don't take your dog around to hers. Don't become *one of those owners*.", "YTA. You sound so insanely immature and selfish. Wanting a dog is not a legitimate need and you knew your mom would be upset. Could\u2019ve waited u til you were 18 and moved out.", "She didn\u2019t abandon you over a dog, she left because of how you both treated her. YTA. All day.", "YTA. In a household, where animals are concerned, everyone needs to consent to it. If one person is uncomfortable, then that's the end of the argument. Your mother put her own feelings aside for 19 years and gave up 2 decades for you to have a dog, despite her discomfort. She has every right to feel comfortable in her own home. You don't get to dictate the way that the household is set up and use depression as an excuse. News flash- millions of people worldwide have depression, myself included. Most of these people manage their depression without the need for an animal and use therapy if medication isn't working. Your mother put your mental health first for 19 years and you didn't care about her mental health- why does your mental health take priority over hers? Your father is now throwing a tantrum because he showed his wife that she doesn't matter and enabled your behaviour. You and your dad are huge AHs- the fact that you didn't even give your mother a few hours of your time without the dog, and put the dog before your mother (a few hours wouldn't have killed you) shows her that she doesn't matter to you. Learn to live a few hours without the dog... otherwise you'll find yourself kicked out of public spaces which don't accept dogs and end up a very lonely man.", "Yeah, bud, YTA. Even the way this is written is so self-entitled and self-absorbed I don\u2019t even know what to say. Good for your mom holding her boundaries. God knows no one else in her life cared about them.", "YTA\n\nAlso your dad. Like I am a dog person but I get how having a dog in the house can be a deal breaker. You two seemed to completely ignored this so she left. Taking your dog to her place isn't necessary so again an asshole to insist on it. Going out of your way to contact your mom and yell at her is even more shitty.\n\nThe shit your dad is going through has more to it than his wife leaving him over a dog. At 21 you could have moved out or waited until you had your own place to get a dog. Your dad should have never given into your begging and you should have just waited.\n\nShit like this is why /r/dogfree is a thing. I say that as someone who will always own dogs and does take my dog places she's welcome.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m a dog person but I do respect people that are not. And no-dog people or no-pet people should feel comfortable in their own home.\n\nAll the post is about you, what you need and what you want. You didn\u2019t even trying to compromise, or to suck it up until you move out. You decided that your needs were more important then hers. Then born of you ganged up against her and walk over her decision. And now you still think she is the problem? \n\nI hope she is having the life she deserve without you both.", "YTA just because you\u2019re depressed doesn\u2019t mean you get to stomp all over other people\u2019s boundaries. Their lives need to go on even when others have problems \nLife is short. Sounds like she suffered from caregiver burnout and nobody listened to her", "YTA I\u2019m sorry you were put in that situation but it was not your home and you were taking a shot in the dark that a dog would fix your depression. Your dad made his own choices and that\u2019s not your fault but your mom made her boundaries very clear which she had every right to do in her home and you both disregarded. I\u2019m glad your life had become better but you do not get to shame your mom like that", "YTA. You badgered and badgered and badgered until your dad came in. Your mom had a FIRM boundary that was steamrolled. You were not owed a dog. The dog was not guaranteed to cure your depression. Your mom left because her boundary was stomped. Based on her reaction, I\u2019m gonna guess this wasn\u2019t the first time your dad decided to just overrule her. She didn\u2019t do shit to your dad, he did it to himself. You were absolutely in the wrong for screaming at her and what you said to her. \n\nDid you or your dad even care to ask why she hates and didn\u2019t want a dog and why she couldn\u2019t compromise this boundary? Or do only you and your dad matter here?", "YTA. I understand the perspective of lashing out at your mom after seeing how much it fucked up your dad. But it seems she was justified in leaving and there was likely more going on. Try to do more fun shit with your dad and go out places with him.", "YTA. \n\nYou were 17, almost an adult. You have your entire adulthood to have a support animal, especially living in your own.\n\nI think you contributed hugely to tearing your family apart, even though it seems like your parents both have their own problems.\n\nYour mom was right to claim her own space and walk away. I\u2019m sure your father promised her they would only ever have one dog and he went back on his promise. Why stay with a man who breaks his promises?\n\nPlus, you had a dog almost your entire childhood and still were depressed, why would a new one make you not depressed, exactly?", "YTA.

She\u2019s probably in a much better place now than when living with two people who clearly had no respect for her. Your father is in such a state because he knows he fucked up. You both ignored her boundaries and you deserve what came your way. The entitlement you have thinking she needs to accept your every whim and go with it is truly disgusting. You have no respect for your mother. She\u2019s not the one who\u2019s going to be miserable and alone. Your dad however\u2026", "YTA I hope your mom is living her best life without you and your dad.", "YTA. Your mother made it clear that she didn\u2019t want another dog, you didn\u2019t have to specifically get another dog either. You and your dad did exactly what she said you did: you stomped all over her boundaries. Also, if her immediate reaction to you and your dad bringing home anyway was to leave and file for divorce, then they probably had way more issues in their marriage. The dog was just the one that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nI was looking into getting an ESA myself when I wasn\u2019t living independently at the time. I wanted a dog at first, but the relative I was living with set a boundary that they weren\u2019t okay with dogs in the house. Did I ignore them and get a dog anyway?

Now is the time to unlearn those toxic traits.", "YTA. You are selfish and inconsiderate and so is your dad. Your mother never wanted a dog and she put up with one for years. You're the one who refused to get help in other ways; you were obsessed with getting a dog. You and your father ignored your mother's feelings because you decided only your feelings mattered. Your father is an asshole for not treating his wife like an equal. And you're a spoiled child for throwing a tantrum and blaming her; your father is not the victim of her. He's paying for his own bad choices. And I say this as someone who loves dogs and suffers from severe depression and anxiety. Grow up, asshole. The fact that you have mental health problems doesn't justify you blaming your mother for everything and treating her so badly.", "YTA I hope you can find a better therapist to help you through your issues. But you need to focus on healing, both for yourself and your parents. Dogs can be wonderful support animals, but I don't believe you absolutely NEEDED one. That was your choice and the way you and your dad handled it did irrepairable damage to your family. You should have gone to Christmas and could have gone without your dog for a few hours.", "This one is really messy. While on the one hand I wouldn't personally see the possibility of a dog over a child's mental health is a reasonable boundary, on the other hand I also think who am I to say what is or isn't an acceptable boundary to have. If this wasn't a dog, and some other boundary would it be more acceptable to me? And if so, who am I to even make that determination if I'm not the person with the boundary?\n\nI think there needs to be more info on why exactly your mother has this boundary. Maybe she had some traumatic experience with dogs that leads to her own mental health decline if she is around one. I feel like a parent having this hard of a boundary over a dog doesn't make sense unless there is something we aren't getting from your OP that would reveal that the mother's boundary was actually more reasonable than you lead on.\n\nEither way, she left because you all weren't even able to compromise on said boundary and immediately went behind her back to get a dog anyways. Like did you ever try to compromise for a different kind of pet? Did you ever try to compromise on alternatives to a support animal to begin with? Did your doctor even give a recommend that you needed one? Did you consult with a doctor on alternatives? Or did you ignore your mother's opinion and get what you wanted when you wanted it?\n\nIn my opinion, she has a right to leave if she feels she is ignored by her own family and that her boundaries are always crossed without even being considered. And I wouldn't want to say parents aren't allowed to have boundaries just because their child wants something, even if its for a mental health reason. Like where would that logically stop? If a child with mental illness says \"I need to eat 5 star dining every night or my mental health will decline\", does a parent have to give into that? I know that's an extreme example, but where is the line for when a parent no longer has any boundaries when it comes to mental health of their child? And who are we to be the ones to define that line?\n\nAll of this considered, I'm going to have to go with either YTA or ESH, with a slight leaning towards YTA.\n\n  \nEDIT: Yeah, changing to YTA after receiving additional info.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
