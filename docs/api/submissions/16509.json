Yes. Have you heard equally harsh things from her on numerous occasions? Seems like it. Stooping to her level one time doesn't make you a bad person. Please try and set some boundaries with your sister and don't enable her terrible behaviour towards you by excusing it.\n\nNTA btw. You were bound to snap at some point.", "Its definitely bad of me to do. Keep in mind i usually don\u2019t talk to her like that at ALL. I have always helped her through her breakups. She\u2019s cheated on people in those relationships however and has been just toxic in general to the people. When she insults me, She talks about how I got cheated on constantly and my lifelong insecurities though, and I always just avoid it or think that she has her own problems. after years of her being like this i just genuinely lost it. She provokes me because she thinks it\u2019s funny, She loves to make me feel like shit and at the time I genuinely felt as if I couldn\u2019t control my reaction. Its for sure bad though ajd i appreciate your comment! I agree which is why i\u2019ve apologized to her (attempted to at least)", "She's only Unloved Forever if she doesn't work on her shitty personality though I think is what she said lol.", "the level of guilt I feel rn shows I for sure won\u2019t do that again \ud83d\ude2d", "So you just expect OP to just take the verbal abuse from her sister? \nI'm glad she fought back. She should do it more often, that should teach her sister not to dish out like that if she can't take the consequences.", "Today is a good day to cry.", "Thank you! I\u2019ve tried setting boundaries and she acts like she\u2019ll try and then makes another remark the next day. We live together so it\u2019s hard to avoid otherwise i\u2019d just not talk to her much. I\u2019ve become somewhat numb to it at this point and she only does it to me not others so that\u2019s why it hurts", "She's upset because you're usually the bigger person.  You gave her a taste of her own medicine.  Petty? Maybe. I don't think you need to overly apolgize. Don't \nbe a doormat for anyone.  You get what you give sometimes. Btw I hope you look into treatment for that agoraphobia, even babysteps (ref from movie \"What About Bob\"). Please don't let anxiety rule your life. Your sister's insults don't help your self esteem to say the least. In my experience guilt adds to anxiety.  Forgive yourself for this enevatable outburst even if she doesn't.", "Since we know she isn't going to change and isn't likely to seek counseling on why she feels the need to put you down to get a rise out of you. Perhaps you might seek some to gain tools on how to better handle her aggressive behavior and not let it build up next time.", ":) NTA", "No, she only falls on her level. She doesn't need to speak to her like that all the time as her sister does.", "So don\u2019t talk to her much. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding of what setting boundaries is. You straight up tell her you will not listen when she says rude things to you. That you will refuse to listen to them or be around here when she talks this way. \n\n You can\u2019t control her behavior but you can control yours. Anytime she starts in on you, walk away. Go to your room and shut the door. Put on headphones. But make it clear you will not entertain her nonsense. \n\n Also, where are your parents in all this? Did she learn this behavior from them or are they as appalled by her behavior as we are?", "I'm sorry, you're in a really difficult situation. I too have a complicated relationship with my sister. Nothing as bad as this but she also took out her own insecurities on me. One of the most liberating things I have done was when I made it clear that I won't be putting up with her behaviour now that we're adults. She actually changed after that. But it's hard when you share the same roof.", "ESH \u2014 her, for reasons you explained, and you for letting her belittle you like that until you can\u2019t take it anymore.", "YTA", "NTA. Your sister sucks. If you can't move away from her just don't engage.", "NTA - You're not a doormat. And, hey, she needs people now to give her feedback about her shitty attitude. If she continues, she will one day apply that attitude to dealing with unhinged people. It will not end well.", "True. \n\nNTA. If you don't want a fight, don't get in the ring.", "Yep. Sister is not only mean, she does also seem to be surprisingly stupid... \ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA, obviously.", "unfortunately, it's probably not going to teach her a damn thing. she sounds like a nightmare to be around.", "NTA but ya'll need to sort shit out. Siblings banter but this ain't that. This is just straight up mean shit ya'll doing. She deserved what she got don't get me wrong but good luck.", "I mean you probably aren't even wrong, if she's insulting you like this just imagine what she has said to ex boyfriends? There's a reason nobody is staying with her, maybe she'll think twice before opening her yap. Insecurities or not, that's no excuse to be a asshole.", "NTA and maybe this is not the best course of action but I find these people knock it off real quick when you start being the same way to them.", "Funny how they don't like the taste of their own medicine \ud83d\ude06.\n\nNTA. I'm actually petty and would have said something back the first time itself.", "NTA but that's.... not normal sibling conversation. That's like, bad. Do your parents know she's saying things like this to you?", "NTA.\n\nAre any of your friends and/or family suggesting that you are?", "NTA A narcissist will hurt your feelings and then cause you to apologize for your reaction to their actions. It\u2019s unhealthy. Better you learn now with your sister how to stand up for yourself than end up in a romantic relationship like this.", "NTA-\nWhat you just described is called reactive abuse.\n\nIt is when someone has been abused and then they finally snap and react to the abuser.\n\nOften then their abuser uses this to paint them as the bad party and themselves as the wounded ones.", "Yea, fight fire with fire ..", "Nah. Her insecurities don\u2019t give her a pass to be abusive. And that\u2019s what she is. Don\u2019t think of this as you hurting her feelings: think of this as you standing up to your abuser.", "you are NTA and this is my first time encountering someone who struggles with agoraphobia so I am genuinely curious how this came along? I only know of its existence because of a video game and just want to understand its cause.", "OP you have lots of insecurities from what you have written. Do YOU insult people to make yourself feel better about yourself? If not, why is it ok for your sister to do that when you would not do that?\n\nYou are doing her a favour by forcing her to find other ways to address her insecurities. We all have insecurities and the best journey we can take is the one that helps us to achieve self love. You are preventing your sister from taking that journey if you dismiss her poor behaviour. She cannot achieve self love while actively being mean to people to prop up her self-esteem.", "thank you! our banter used to be lighthearted and fun but the older she got the meaner she got. i feel bad because i think she has underlying issues i don\u2019t know about ajd i don\u2019t want to make her feel worse about herself because that wasn\u2019t my goal with my comment", "she gets super toxic with the people she dates and at the time i felt like she needed a wake up call that she can\u2019t talk to people that way. they\u2019re all online boyfriends as well.", "I definitelt should\u2019ve stood up for myself more. I would in the past and it\u2019d just result in another more insanely intense insult and I\u2019d avoid even doing it in the first place so I could avoid the second insult if that makes sense? she also is VERY creative with it so i never know what to expecr", "my mom defends her because she\u2019s a year younger than me \ud83e\udd72 i\u2019m the middle child so everything that happens to me is brushed under the rug lmao", "yeah i didn\u2019t know ab agoraphobia until i had it myself! agoraphobia is a phobia of feeling trapped in certain situations, or feeling unsafe (our homes being our safe place). theres many causes for it but here\u2019s my story. basically, a traumatizing experience happened one day while i was in public. originally, i wasn\u2019t housebound yet but i would get panic attacks in public or even in the car. i slowlt became unable to leave without getting them. i stayed in my house and my yard for over a year. this year, late february i left my house for the first time in a year and slowly added more distance every day and i was fine! i\u2019m in recovery now luckily! i can go anywhere in town and be fine i just can\u2019t go to school yet since sone days i can\u2019t be guaranteed to be able to be somewhere for hours yk? agoraphobia has genuinely been my hardest battle so far and took over my life completely for that entire year. i wouldn\u2019t wish that pain on anyone and it was completely out of my control. its either have a severe panic attack and embarrass myself everywhere i go or stay home and use a ridiculous amount of amazon. i chose the latter. i hope this makes sense! i apologize for getting sidetracked", "I dont! i leave the house pretty much daily (usually, other than setbacks) and have been for a couple months. I just can\u2019t go to school again yet as it\u2019s anxiety inducing for me", "i\u2019m so glad she changed! i\u2019ve tried standing up for myself so many times and it works temporarily but not for long. i\u2019m hoping to distance myself from her for a few days to make it clear that i\u2019m not joking about my boundaries and hope that helps. i already apologized for what i said and we actually had a nice conversation so my hopes are high"]}
