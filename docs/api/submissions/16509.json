However, it\u2019s a good skill to be able to ignore people like that and not bite back at them.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for standing up for yourself.", "For liberty and revenge!", "Spoken like a true Klingon \ud83d\ude2c", "You are not responsible for your sisters insecurities. \n\nWas the comment harsh? Yes. Have you heard equally harsh things from her on numerous occasions? Seems like it. Stooping to her level one time doesn't make you a bad person. Please try and set some boundaries with your sister and don't enable her terrible behaviour towards you by excusing it.\n\nNTA btw. You were bound to snap at some point.", "Its definitely bad of me to do. Keep in mind i usually don\u2019t talk to her like that at ALL. I have always helped her through her breakups. She\u2019s cheated on people in those relationships however and has been just toxic in general to the people. When she insults me, She talks about how I got cheated on constantly and my lifelong insecurities though, and I always just avoid it or think that she has her own problems. after years of her being like this i just genuinely lost it. She provokes me because she thinks it\u2019s funny, She loves to make me feel like shit and at the time I genuinely felt as if I couldn\u2019t control my reaction. Its for sure bad though ajd i appreciate your comment! I agree which is why i\u2019ve apologized to her (attempted to at least)", "She's only Unloved Forever if she doesn't work on her shitty personality though I think is what she said lol.", "the level of guilt I feel rn shows I for sure won\u2019t do that again \ud83d\ude2d", "So you just expect OP to just take the verbal abuse from her sister? \nI'm glad she fought back. She should do it more often, that should teach her sister not to dish out like that if she can't take the consequences.", "Today is a good day to cry.", "Thank you! I\u2019ve tried setting boundaries and she acts like she\u2019ll try and then makes another remark the next day. We live together so it\u2019s hard to avoid otherwise i\u2019d just not talk to her much. I\u2019ve become somewhat numb to it at this point and she only does it to me not others so that\u2019s why it hurts", "She's upset because you're usually the bigger person.  You gave her a taste of her own medicine.  Petty? Maybe. I don't think you need to overly apolgize. Don't \nbe a doormat for anyone.  You get what you give sometimes. Btw I hope you look into treatment for that agoraphobia, even babysteps (ref from movie \"What About Bob\"). Please don't let anxiety rule your life. Your sister's insults don't help your self esteem to say the least. In my experience guilt adds to anxiety.  Forgive yourself for this enevatable outburst even if she doesn't.", "Since we know she isn't going to change and isn't likely to seek counseling on why she feels the need to put you down to get a rise out of you. Perhaps you might seek some to gain tools on how to better handle her aggressive behavior and not let it build up next time.", ":) NTA", "No, she only falls on her level. She doesn't need to speak to her like that all the time as her sister does.", "So don\u2019t talk to her much. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding of what setting boundaries is. You straight up tell her you will not listen when she says rude things to you. That you will refuse to listen to them or be around here when she talks this way. \n\n You can\u2019t control her behavior but you can control yours. Anytime she starts in on you, walk away. Go to your room and shut the door. Put on headphones. But make it clear you will not entertain her nonsense. \n\n Also, where are your parents in all this? Did she learn this behavior from them or are they as appalled by her behavior as we are?", "I'm sorry, you're in a really difficult situation. I too have a complicated relationship with my sister. Nothing as bad as this but she also took out her own insecurities on me. One of the most liberating things I have done was when I made it clear that I won't be putting up with her behaviour now that we're adults. She actually changed after that. But it's hard when you share the same roof."]}
