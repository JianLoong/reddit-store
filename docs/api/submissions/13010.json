I want to get the condo and have the girls in one room and my son in the other. My wife doesn't want her daughter to share a room with the twins so she either wants the 4 bedroom house or if we have to get a 3 bedroom, she wants to have the twins share with our son until we can eventually add a 4th bedroom or her daughter goes to college and won't be traveling with us as much. \n\nI tried to compromise and find a house that has a 4th bedroom for my stepdaughter but is still walkable but my wife still doesn't like it because her daughter would be in the basement while the rest of us would be on the 2nd floor. She says this house would isolate her daughter. Then she said she doesn't even want to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants because the double stroller is too bulky to bring into half of them, she'll have to deal with our son complaining about his feet hurting, and she can't even make that walk with the kids half the year when it's snowing. \n\nShe has a habit of spoiling her daughter and I think that's what she's doing here at my and my kids expense.

You are, in essence, making your kids her responsibility. Dude, she's ten. What's it going to be like when she's 12 or 13 or 16 and wants privacy? No 16 year old wants to sleep in the same room as (edited) 8 year olds. Why are you treating your stepdaughter's placement like the problem? Why don't you move the toddlers you fathered into your room? She never asked you to have more babies. I hate when I read posts like this... you aren't listening to your wife's needs as it is. The \"double-stroller +a five year old whose feet get tired\"  problem walking is real, and you are being a jerk by ignoring her.", "YTA.

Just that you can walk to shops a little quicker?\n\nMaking a 10 year old share a room with two 2 year olds is a bit much. She'll be a teenager soon and she'll be sharing with two 5 year olds.

And your tone of resentment is revealing: you accuse your wife of spoiling HER daughter at YOUR expense and the expense of YOUR kids.  Your stepdaughter is also your daughter now.

Why do you think a 10 year old should sharing with the twins and not the 5 year old? So while you say your wife is spoiling her daughter, the same could be said about you spoiling your son. Why is he more deserving of his own space than the 10 year old?\n\nThis is a vacation home, not a necessity. Your wife is laying out particular wants for this house, and they all seem very reasonable.

They're two years old. There's nothing wrong with literal babies sharing a room regardless of the sexes involved -- my kids shared till they were nine and seven. \n\nThere's a lot wrong, on the other hand, with making a ten year old share a room with two toddlers. Toddlers have no behavioral filters yet; they act impulsively exactly how they want if nobody stops them. Whether or not you intended it this way (and I'm doing you the courtesy of assuming you didn't), your ten year old will be constantly required to manage the behavior of the toddlers. Every minute. In her own room, where she'll get no time to relax. \n\nThis is unreasonable to ask of her.", "YTA. She is eight years older than the twins, that is not an appropriate age gap for sharing a room. \n\nYou're also not really looking at the bigger picture it sounds like, just what checks a couple of boxes.

You and your wife should sit down and decide on what you each feel is a nonnegotiable about any home you buy as well as what you are able to compromise on. You need to look at what are Wants vs. Needs. Putting a 10 year old in a room with two toddlers is your wife\u2019s non negotiable and I agree the 10 year old will basically just become their built in babysitter which is not fair to her.  Also toddlers have a completely different sleep schedule and the ten year old may wake them up when she goes to sleep as well.", "YTA. What your wife is suggesting is reasonable. \n\nHave you considered putting a sleeper type sofa in the living room and having the 10 year old and the 5 year old trade midway through? It\u2019s a vacation home, not a permanent living situation. Even if your twins share with the 5 year old - it\u2019s a vacation. \n\nMarriage is also about compromise.

She would have more privacy, which could make a big difference as she gets older.\n\nIt is kind of interesting that the options are shoved the 10-year-old in with twin toddlers or give her an entire floor of the house to herself.\n\nNot that you need to take financial advice from a 10-year-old but why don't you ask her? At least have the conversation so you know how she feels. As the oldest in a string of children with considerable age gaps, and the only child from a different marriage, she might already feel isolated from the family.

I'm never normally one who goes for the option that has to have a car, but in this situation, it seems like OP likes the idea of being able to walk into town when he wants a bit of a break or something, but wouldn't do the actual work of walking 4 children into town and dealing with the double stroller etc.", "Especially since they've been together since the girl was 4 at the oldest.", "In a few years perhaps, but I could easily see this becoming like \"putting cinderella in the attic\" .\n\nPutting the STEP-child or sibling in a \"out of sight\" area is rarely  a good idea.", "He said ...if it was\nNo difference at all.\nHe would of loved it.\nYou would of hated it.\n2 varying opinions.", "Yeah. I have a feeling he will not be the one helping her doing this. It is very telling she didn't say \"they\", but said \"she\".", "It\u2019s so he can walk back and forth from the bar without having to drive", "Yes, you're probably right. Even if the basement will actually be preferable with the SD when viewed dispassionately, with step-children you have to be really careful about feelings, and making sure your step-child doesn't feel left out is really important. Although it doesn't seem all that important to OP.", "But she has very valid arguments against walking in and of itself (snow, bully strollers, kids complaining). How are these stupid? \n\nAnd maybe she has to prioritise her kids because you only want to prioritise yours.", "A walkable neighborhood where she would have to corral a handful of kids to go anywhere. Better hope none of them run into traffic when she\u2019s handling the twins", "And probably so that she has the carrying capacity to do anything useful. Is she supposed to push the stroller, hold the 5 yr old\u2019s hand, and make the ten year old carry all of the bags?\n\nYou want to alienate a child for the sake of a walkable neighborhood that your family will likely not even be able to utilize.", "Your wife is trying to treat all the kids equally/fairly while you prioritize yourself and your kids and disregard your stepdaughter. Why do you loathe your stepdaughter so much? Why did you get with someone who already had a child if you were going to treat them as less because she doesn\u2019t have your dna? You obviously don\u2019t see her as your stepdaughter but as your wife\u2019s kid. You even said \u201cspoiling her daughter at my and my kids expense\u201d not y\u2019all\u2019s kids, but strictly \u201cmy kids\u201d as if your wife is not the mother to them. Be a better person and parent for your kids, otherwise they might grow to be like you which would be a shame.", "Why does your kid need his own room?", "I agree fully. I feel guilty for even saying \"that show you really like\" is dumb to my partner, let alone calling THEM or their ideas \"stupid.\"\n\nETA : I'm glad you respect your wife enough to not even consider it a possibility :)", "Side note: If OP can afford a vaca home but thinks that driving is breaking the bank, then maybe they should reconsider the vacation home or live somewhere with better public transit?\n\nI am V unsympathetic to any financial woes OP might have, given that this is a luxury.", "Honestly, everything else aside, I DO think it's stupid to specifically not want a walkable area", "Are you kidding. My wife is my hero and my rock. I was in a very very bad relationship prior to my current wife. My ex was pure evil and did a number on me financially and physically It\u2019s taken 15 years for us to get where we are. I would not be living my best life if she didn\u2019t save me, after initially rejecting me since we lived 45 minutes apart. And double booking our first date. She actually had a date lined up after ours just in case.. needless to say she never made it to her second date. We spent the entire weekend together\u2026ENTIRE WEEKEND.. \n\nShe told me the other night that no way could any other person love her, make her laugh, or shown her the world like I have done the past 15 years. OP needs to treat his wife like that. She\u2019s your queen. If she says 4 rooms then it\u2019s 4 rooms. No discussion", "And even with a very quick time period to impregnate his now wife, that's still being in the daughter's life since she was 4. Let's face it, probably 3, which means he's been in her life since she could remember, and he's *still* not referring to her as his daughter, and putting her needs last. Not a great sign.", "It\u2019s stupid because she had relations before he came along and had this child he hates so much. \nIt\u2019s stupid because HIS kids and ego are more important.", "I usually agree with this - walkability is incredibly important to me - but part of me thinks she has these complaints because he's not helping with the walking part. If she's always the one dealing with the stroller and making sure the 5-year-old doesn't run off, and dealing with his complaints about not wanting to walk that far... then walking into town doesn't sound all that appealing. He even says \"she can't even make that walk with the kids half the year when it's snowing\" - why isn't he phrasing it like \"we can't make the walk half the year\"? What's he doing while she's dealing with the kids?", "I am so happy for your current situation, and I am so sad that you had to go through that level of abuse.\n\nMy partner and I are still navigating our triggers, we were both in abusive relationships prior.\n\nI am so happy that you are able to connect with someone emotionally after going through something like that, because I know first hand how hard it is. I'm still learning that I don't deserve to be abused.\n\nI love this for you, unironically and this internet stranger is so happy you're in a relationship where you both feel validated <3", "OP Just dripping with misogyny"]}
