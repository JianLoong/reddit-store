I want to get the condo and have the girls in one room and my son in the other. My wife doesn't want her daughter to share a room with the twins so she either wants the 4 bedroom house or if we have to get a 3 bedroom, she wants to have the twins share with our son until we can eventually add a 4th bedroom or her daughter goes to college and won't be traveling with us as much. \n\nI tried to compromise and find a house that has a 4th bedroom for my stepdaughter but is still walkable but my wife still doesn't like it because her daughter would be in the basement while the rest of us would be on the 2nd floor. She says this house would isolate her daughter. Then she said she doesn't even want to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants because the double stroller is too bulky to bring into half of them, she'll have to deal with our son complaining about his feet hurting, and she can't even make that walk with the kids half the year when it's snowing. \n\nShe has a habit of spoiling her daughter and I think that's what she's doing here at my and my kids expense.

You are expecting your stepdaughter to take the hit. Not you. Listen to your wife-- it's not even reasonable to expect a ten year old to sleep in the same room (and likely inadvertently providing childcare) for two year olds. You are, in essence, making your kids her responsibility. Dude, she's ten. What's it going to be like when she's 12 or 13 or 16 and wants privacy? No 16 year old wants to sleep in the same room as (edited) 8 year olds. Why are you treating your stepdaughter's placement like the problem? Why don't you move the toddlers you fathered into your room? She never asked you to have more babies. I hate when I read posts like this... you aren't listening to your wife's needs as it is. The \"double-stroller +a five year old whose feet get tired\"  problem walking is real, and you are being a jerk by ignoring her.", "YTA.

Just that you can walk to shops a little quicker?\n\nMaking a 10 year old share a room with two 2 year olds is a bit much. She'll be a teenager soon and she'll be sharing with two 5 year olds.

And your tone of resentment is revealing: you accuse your wife of spoiling HER daughter at YOUR expense and the expense of YOUR kids.  Your stepdaughter is also your daughter now.

Why do you think a 10 year old should sharing with the twins and not the 5 year old? So while you say your wife is spoiling her daughter, the same could be said about you spoiling your son. Why is he more deserving of his own space than the 10 year old?\n\nThis is a vacation home, not a necessity. Your wife is laying out particular wants for this house, and they all seem very reasonable. You on the other hand, make it pretty clear in your writing that the 10 year old is not your child and not your problem, and that having to in any way plan around this additional child is the greatest inconvenience for you.", "YTA. They're two years old. There's nothing wrong with literal babies sharing a room regardless of the sexes involved -- my kids shared till they were nine and seven. \n\nThere's a lot wrong, on the other hand, with making a ten year old share a room with two toddlers. Toddlers have no behavioral filters yet; they act impulsively exactly how they want if nobody stops them. Whether or not you intended it this way (and I'm doing you the courtesy of assuming you didn't), your ten year old will be constantly required to manage the behavior of the toddlers. Every minute. In her own room, where she'll get no time to relax. \n\nThis is unreasonable to ask of her.", "YTA. She is eight years older than the twins, that is not an appropriate age gap for sharing a room. \n\nYou're also not really looking at the bigger picture it sounds like, just what checks a couple of boxes.

It\u2019s a vacation house and very temporary! \n\nIn the meantime, start thinking of the fact that to your wife, you are raising FOUR kids.

In a few years she'll be a teenager.

You and your wife should sit down and decide on what you each feel is a nonnegotiable about any home you buy as well as what you are able to compromise on. You need to look at what are Wants vs. Needs. Putting a 10 year old in a room with two toddlers is your wife\u2019s non negotiable and I agree the 10 year old will basically just become their built in babysitter which is not fair to her.  Also toddlers have a completely different sleep schedule and the ten year old may wake them up when she goes to sleep as well.", "YTA. What your wife is suggesting is reasonable. \n\nHave you considered putting a sleeper type sofa in the living room and having the 10 year old and the 5 year old trade midway through? It\u2019s a vacation home, not a permanent living situation. Even if your twins share with the 5 year old - it\u2019s a vacation. \n\nMarriage is also about compromise.

Taking away the connotation that basements are creepy or isolated or somehow of less value than second floor bedrooms, she would also have a more independent space to herself. She would have more privacy, which could make a big difference as she gets older.\n\nIt is kind of interesting that the options are shoved the 10-year-old in with twin toddlers or give her an entire floor of the house to herself.\n\nNot that you need to take financial advice from a 10-year-old but why don't you ask her? At least have the conversation so you know how she feels. As the oldest in a string of children with considerable age gaps, and the only child from a different marriage, she might already feel isolated from the family.
