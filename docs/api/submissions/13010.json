I want to get the condo and have the girls in one room and my son in the other. My wife doesn't want her daughter to share a room with the twins so she either wants the 4 bedroom house or if we have to get a 3 bedroom, she wants to have the twins share with our son until we can eventually add a 4th bedroom or her daughter goes to college and won't be traveling with us as much. \n\nI tried to compromise and find a house that has a 4th bedroom for my stepdaughter but is still walkable but my wife still doesn't like it because her daughter would be in the basement while the rest of us would be on the 2nd floor. She says this house would isolate her daughter. Then she said she doesn't even want to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants because the double stroller is too bulky to bring into half of them, she'll have to deal with our son complaining about his feet hurting, and she can't even make that walk with the kids half the year when it's snowing. \n\nShe has a habit of spoiling her daughter and I think that's what she's doing here at my and my kids expense.

You are, in essence, making your kids her responsibility. Dude, she's ten. What's it going to be like when she's 12 or 13 or 16 and wants privacy? No 16 year old wants to sleep in the same room as (edited) 8 year olds. Why are you treating your stepdaughter's placement like the problem? Why don't you move the toddlers you fathered into your room? She never asked you to have more babies. I hate when I read posts like this... you aren't listening to your wife's needs as it is. The \"double-stroller +a five year old whose feet get tired\"  problem walking is real, and you are being a jerk by ignoring her.", "YTA.

Just that you can walk to shops a little quicker?\n\nMaking a 10 year old share a room with two 2 year olds is a bit much. She'll be a teenager soon and she'll be sharing with two 5 year olds.

And your tone of resentment is revealing: you accuse your wife of spoiling HER daughter at YOUR expense and the expense of YOUR kids.  Your stepdaughter is also your daughter now.

Why do you think a 10 year old should sharing with the twins and not the 5 year old? So while you say your wife is spoiling her daughter, the same could be said about you spoiling your son. Why is he more deserving of his own space than the 10 year old?\n\nThis is a vacation home, not a necessity. Your wife is laying out particular wants for this house, and they all seem very reasonable.

They're two years old. There's nothing wrong with literal babies sharing a room regardless of the sexes involved -- my kids shared till they were nine and seven. \n\nThere's a lot wrong, on the other hand, with making a ten year old share a room with two toddlers. Toddlers have no behavioral filters yet; they act impulsively exactly how they want if nobody stops them. Whether or not you intended it this way (and I'm doing you the courtesy of assuming you didn't), your ten year old will be constantly required to manage the behavior of the toddlers. Every minute. In her own room, where she'll get no time to relax. \n\nThis is unreasonable to ask of her.", "YTA. She is eight years older than the twins, that is not an appropriate age gap for sharing a room. \n\nYou're also not really looking at the bigger picture it sounds like, just what checks a couple of boxes.

You and your wife should sit down and decide on what you each feel is a nonnegotiable about any home you buy as well as what you are able to compromise on. You need to look at what are Wants vs. Needs. Putting a 10 year old in a room with two toddlers is your wife\u2019s non negotiable and I agree the 10 year old will basically just become their built in babysitter which is not fair to her.  Also toddlers have a completely different sleep schedule and the ten year old may wake them up when she goes to sleep as well.", "YTA. What your wife is suggesting is reasonable. \n\nHave you considered putting a sleeper type sofa in the living room and having the 10 year old and the 5 year old trade midway through? It\u2019s a vacation home, not a permanent living situation. Even if your twins share with the 5 year old - it\u2019s a vacation. \n\nMarriage is also about compromise.

She would have more privacy, which could make a big difference as she gets older.\n\nIt is kind of interesting that the options are shoved the 10-year-old in with twin toddlers or give her an entire floor of the house to herself.\n\nNot that you need to take financial advice from a 10-year-old but why don't you ask her? At least have the conversation so you know how she feels. As the oldest in a string of children with considerable age gaps, and the only child from a different marriage, she might already feel isolated from the family.

He mentioned the basement bedroom isn\u2019t big enough for two adults, so presumably at least a portion of the basement is finished space. If there is also a finished living area down there maybe they could set it up just for her like a tween hangout space and make it off limits to the younger kids as she gets older. \n\nAlthough OP mentioned his wife has other problems with this house that would cost too much to fix so maybe it is off the table anyway.", "No bathtubs? You have 2 year olds, how will they bathe?", "So, in other words, you want a 10 year old to share a room with twin toddlers so your 5 year old son can have his own room, and the only alternative you\u2019re willing to do is force the 10 year old to sleep in an unfinished basement that doesnt have a bathroom or other amenities, so if she ever needs something, she has to go upstairs and possibly through the kitchen to do things like showering, causing disruption since the kitchen is so small?\n\nEven if the 10-year old didnt have to sleep in the basement of that house, still seems like a horrible house to begin with, why would you ever consider that place an option?", "INFO: why can\u2019t the smaller kids share for a while, then your son go in the basement? \n\nYou seem hell bent on SD. who\u2019s about to enter puberty share with toddlers, yet you don\u2019t even consider that your kids who are closer in age could do the same..", "And if the daughter has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, she has to go through the creepy basement and go upstairs.", "So your wife is trying to get full custody? If she does, are you going to continue to treat step daughter like an unwanted guest? Honestly, the way you wrote this seems like you barely tolerate her. It's a vacation house. If the in town option is so necessary, take the biggest room, put in a divider, and put the 5 year old and twins there.", "She is simply a birthing vessel for HIS children.", "Not to mention they probably all have the same bedtime, while the 10 year old presumably does not.", "I agree! Shoot when my siblings and I were in grade school we would go in on vacation homes with numerous other families. My siblings and I were about 8-10 years older than my cousins so the babies/toddlers slept in a room with the parents while my siblings and I (ages 8-17) just slept on the floor/couches where we were out of the way. It allowed us to go on vacation. When we became adults my parents then got our own smaller house but we were able to contribute to the cost of the house.", "That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. She wants the 4 bedroom that was driving distance which did not have a basement room. He wants the 3 bedroom that is walking distance. She argued the bedroom setup was unfair and it should be divided more fairly by age rather than gender. \n\nHis compromise was a 4 bedroom at walkable distance but she said *that* 4 bedroom (not the one at driving distance) was not acceptable since it left a 10yr 2 floors below everyone else. \n\nShe then countered she does think walkable is even a feature they should compromise on since it\u2019s not always walkable and the walk doesn\u2019t work for young children. To be fair it sounds like he doesn\u2019t even help with the children because she was saying *she\u2019d* have to wrangle the stroller, *she\u2019d* have to deal with the complaining child, and *she* can\u2019t walk with the kids in winter. He didn\u2019t write \u201cI countered back I\u2019d obviously parent my children this is not a valid argument\u201d which is what really makes me wonder.", "The basement bedroom was his compromise that was still in walking distance but was also a 4 bedroom.  Wife said no because 10 yr old would be in the basement and all others would be on 2nd floor.  The 1st 4 bedroom mentioned wasn't in walking distance.  Wife doesn't care about walking distance as half the time it snows so walking isn't an option and the double stroller is too bulky to take into shops and restaurants.", "Basement", "that's why i said they need 4 BRs. by the time the twins need their own room the oldest will be off to college", "the word \"teenager\" has a real definition, and it means someone's whos over the ages of 12 and younger than 20, puberty is entirely irrelevant to that", "I agree that, given the situation, it is not reasonable at all.", "Shutting out someone from the family would be more like putting one kid sleeping into an separate building, not different floor In the same house.\n\n\nFunny to Bring out the personal anecdotes out since your own opinion is also just an personal anecdote. \n\nOP and their SO really should just ask the daughters opinion. Would she like a basement floor, Or would she prefer her room to be at the same floor. Simple as that.\n\nFrom my pov there are 3 options \n\n1)ask the daughter, and get the fancy vacay house that fits her answer.\n\n2)place the 3 youngest In the same room and have that as an max 5 year solution and get back into this same problem.\n\n3)do what my parents did: not enough rooms for all kids and parents= parents sacrifice their privacy and sleep In livingroom/whatever and let the kids have the rooms.", "you just assume is doesn't have a window? plenty of basements have windows. shit some even have doors that lead outside. thanks for your worthless and irrelevant assumptions. also, do you know what sub your on? AITA is ALL opinions", "its a basement bedroom, not her own apartment. teens can stray farther than than their parents eyesight. as for your \"walkabout and lonesome\" comment i don't know how that factors in at all, but you give off this really sexist vibe that because she's a girl she somehow needs to be under lock and key, so i really don't care what your onion is, the 1950s called they wanted you sexism back", "And you just said the same. \nIf I was ....", "You would have felt pretty shut out, but that's a personal anecdote. A lot of assumptions about future planning, too. Don't make posts like this about yourself and what you would want.", "They could just, I don\u2019t know, TALK to the daughter and ask if she would be okay with the basement room\u2026", "My son has his own bedroom upstairs with the rest of us, and would rather sleep squeezed into the tiny sofa in the basement if he has the choice.  They should ask the 10-year old what she would like to do.   She might want the basement space for a few years and then possibly swap with the younger ones when they reach that age and she's a teen.   If they're still married, of course.....", "Here's a crazy idea -- they could ask her for her opinion and what she would like.", "Agreed! The parents should take the basement. It can't be too small to fit at least a full size bed and dresser. It will be fine for a few years and when the daughter is older, they can swap when she likely will want some space away from the littles.", "Yes but forcing a 10yo to share a room with her 2yo siblings ain't the best idea either", "Who else will look after the twins at night, if not the wife. Surely NOT OP.", "Condos don't generally have basements.  The basement talk was about the 3rd house option, and his wife had a great point that it's really isolating to stick a kid down in a basement.", "Bestie, I'm sorry to be the first one to tell you this, but all words are made up.

The definition changed as society changed how they viewed children.", "And i thanked you for it.", "\"but that's just me.

Your stopped reading after a few words as well?\n\n\"but that's just me. All families are different\" is me saying \"this is a personal anecdote and it doesn't mean anything\" as a direct response to the person I was replying to who gave an anecdote as a fact.

That\u2019s how twelve year olds argue. Why would the oldest child have to share and not the child who is only three years older than the younger kids?

If the 2 year olds slept well and all the girls got along, why not? If not, maybe all the littles in one room and the 10 year old in the other, at least for right now. Or the 2 year olds might do better sleeping in the parents' room until they're a bit older. Personally as the parent of little kids I'd go with the condo in walking distance of everything in a heartbeat and just be flexible with the sleeping arrangements, two bedrooms is plenty for four kids assuming they're not in the vacation home the majority of the time.
