I want to get the condo and have the girls in one room and my son in the other. My wife doesn't want her daughter to share a room with the twins so she either wants the 4 bedroom house or if we have to get a 3 bedroom, she wants to have the twins share with our son until we can eventually add a 4th bedroom or her daughter goes to college and won't be traveling with us as much. \n\nI tried to compromise and find a house that has a 4th bedroom for my stepdaughter but is still walkable but my wife still doesn't like it because her daughter would be in the basement while the rest of us would be on the 2nd floor. She says this house would isolate her daughter. Then she said she doesn't even want to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants because the double stroller is too bulky to bring into half of them, she'll have to deal with our son complaining about his feet hurting, and she can't even make that walk with the kids half the year when it's snowing. \n\nShe has a habit of spoiling her daughter and I think that's what she's doing here at my and my kids expense.

You are expecting your stepdaughter to take the hit. Not you. Listen to your wife-- it's not even reasonable to expect a ten year old to sleep in the same room (and likely inadvertently providing childcare) for two year olds. You are, in essence, making your kids her responsibility. Dude, she's ten. What's it going to be like when she's 12 or 13 or 16 and wants privacy? No 16 year old wants to sleep in the same room as (edited) 8 year olds. Why are you treating your stepdaughter's placement like the problem? Why don't you move the toddlers you fathered into your room? She never asked you to have more babies. I hate when I read posts like this... you aren't listening to your wife's needs as it is. The \"double-stroller +a five year old whose feet get tired\"  problem walking is real, and you are being a jerk by ignoring her.", "YTA.

Just that you can walk to shops a little quicker?\n\nMaking a 10 year old share a room with two 2 year olds is a bit much. She'll be a teenager soon and she'll be sharing with two 5 year olds.

And your tone of resentment is revealing: you accuse your wife of spoiling HER daughter at YOUR expense and the expense of YOUR kids.  Your stepdaughter is also your daughter now.

Why do you think a 10 year old should sharing with the twins and not the 5 year old? So while you say your wife is spoiling her daughter, the same could be said about you spoiling your son. Why is he more deserving of his own space than the 10 year old?\n\nThis is a vacation home, not a necessity. Your wife is laying out particular wants for this house, and they all seem very reasonable. You on the other hand, make it pretty clear in your writing that the 10 year old is not your child and not your problem, and that having to in any way plan around this additional child is the greatest inconvenience for you.", "YTA. They're two years old. There's nothing wrong with literal babies sharing a room regardless of the sexes involved -- my kids shared till they were nine and seven. \n\nThere's a lot wrong, on the other hand, with making a ten year old share a room with two toddlers. Toddlers have no behavioral filters yet; they act impulsively exactly how they want if nobody stops them. Whether or not you intended it this way (and I'm doing you the courtesy of assuming you didn't), your ten year old will be constantly required to manage the behavior of the toddlers. Every minute. In her own room, where she'll get no time to relax. \n\nThis is unreasonable to ask of her.", "YTA. She is eight years older than the twins, that is not an appropriate age gap for sharing a room. \n\nYou're also not really looking at the bigger picture it sounds like, just what checks a couple of boxes.

It\u2019s a vacation house and very temporary! \n\nIn the meantime, start thinking of the fact that to your wife, you are raising FOUR kids.

In a few years she'll be a teenager.

You and your wife should sit down and decide on what you each feel is a nonnegotiable about any home you buy as well as what you are able to compromise on. You need to look at what are Wants vs. Needs. Putting a 10 year old in a room with two toddlers is your wife\u2019s non negotiable and I agree the 10 year old will basically just become their built in babysitter which is not fair to her.  Also toddlers have a completely different sleep schedule and the ten year old may wake them up when she goes to sleep as well.", "YTA. What your wife is suggesting is reasonable. \n\nHave you considered putting a sleeper type sofa in the living room and having the 10 year old and the 5 year old trade midway through? It\u2019s a vacation home, not a permanent living situation. Even if your twins share with the 5 year old - it\u2019s a vacation. \n\nMarriage is also about compromise.

It is impossible to walk at all if she has to mind four children, in the snow it is even worse.", "YTA \n\nYou obviously didn't take into account nor care( or maybe you did so that you don't have to do any of the work), that if you put the 10 year old in with 2 year olds she will literally get no sleep or space, nothing of hers will be left alone/destroyed, no privacy, because she will be at the beck and call and mercy of those toddlers.

Walking distance is great and I'd personally look for that myself but I'm not a mother and don't have a double stroller and a 5yo to think about as well. I think you two should keep looking for a 4 bedroom house in walkable distance and if she wants to drive and finds that easier; than she can do that. She's right. Winter and strollers don't mix well.

You've been in her life since she was five. But it's 'her daughter' and 'my wife's kid', meaning she is very separate from the kids you and your wife have together? This is a bad mindset.
