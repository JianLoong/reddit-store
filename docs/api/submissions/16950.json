The big one we sleep in, the small one we use as an office/gaming room. I have a huge desktop computer which I use both for home office once a week, while she hooks up her work laptop to the screens and uses it for home office 2-3x a week.\n\nThe home office has one big desktop computer. This is my own personal computer I've bought with my own money. I use it for work and for gaming. She has her own work laptops. She does not use my desktop computer. She connects her work laptops to one of the monitors in there.\n\nMonday she worked there for home office.\n\nTuesday I used it for home office, as well as some gaming in the evening.\n\nWednesday, again she used it for home office while I went to the office. She said she also wanted to use it in the evning to do more work, to which I said I want to use it to game tonight for a couple hours. Mind you, the past 3 weeks I've spent all my time moving us into this house, while she's been down due to medical issues. Finally I have a little bit of free time again and I haven't been able to do any gaming for atleast 1,5 months.\n\nHeres how I see it:We both had something we wanted to do.\n\nShe wanted to do some extra work in the evening\n\nI wanted to do some gaming for 1-2 hours\n\nHow could we best reach that goal for both of us where both of us get what we want?\n\nShe has a laptop, very easy to just take that to the livingroom/bedroom and I could get her monitor for her so she could work anywhere she wants.\n\nFor me to unplug the desktop, and other accessories (keyboard, mouse, headset) would be a lot of hassle, compared to the little amount of work needed to set up her laptop literally anywhere in the apartment.\n\nKeep in mind, moving in to this place has drastically increased the standard of our living situation, as we used to live in a tiny one room aparment 310sqft for a year, and we both quite enjoy having an office room. Usually she's the one that uses the room the most during the week due to home office, while I tend to use it for gaming. It's been a little more gaming than usual for me lately as I haven't been able to do it at all for the past months due to life stresses.\n\nI ended up using it, and she got very angry with me saying I'm a selfish asshole, even though she was home in the room all day, and I ended up playing for 1,5 hours.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add something: The work she wanted to do was to finish up a report that had to be done for the next day, she said it was important. I still don't see why it has to be done specifically in the office room when it can be done anywhere with a laptop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for everyone replying. It seems I am the asshole and I was unempathetic towards my girlfriend. I will be working on that and be more understand to her needs in the future and make a plan so that we can both be happy.

For example, it would be a no-no for me to work in the bed.\n\n\nI also agree with those saying that working is more important than gaming. It's what it is.\n\nI hate too small houses because of that. You are not set up in a house that is comfortable for two people doing WFH.", "YTA, work comes first and you could just have waited for her to finish before starting your gaming. To avoid this in the future, maybe make a weekly schedule of who needs the room and at what hours.", "YTA\n\nNot just for forcing her to work while you play but for even posting this and then fighting with everyone that does not agree with you.", "Did she want to do more work, or did she need to catch up because she's fallen behind because of her medical issues? A laptop is fine, but using it without a bigger screen slows you down majorly, if you  need to keep several windows open on the screen.\nSoft YTA", "Yta, a job is more important than a hobby. She had a time frame to work in. You can game at any point for any amount of time on any day. \n\nA home office is a home office. Why should she be expected to work somewhere else to do necessary work so you can play games in the home office? I understand its not a priority for you because its not your work, but its hers. And that should mean you take her work as seriously as she does.", "Info: does she pay half the rent?", "YTA. What are you, five? She had deadline.", "ESH\nIt sounds like she had a good work flow going and wanted to finish her important report that was due the next day but her reaction was a bit over the top. \n\nPersonally, work is more important and I would've just waited til later that night or tomorrow to game, if you'd gone a month and a half another day wouldn't have killed you.", "ESH - even though I think the Op should have prioritised her work, I\u2019m looking at the whole picture. It\u2019s pretty clear that Op has been shouldering the larger brunt of the work at home due to her medical issues, and has been consumed so much by work that he hasn\u2019t been given a lot of down time. \n\nBurn out is a pretty clear risk here, and I say this as someone with an autoimmune condition - sometimes I need to be cut some slack because I physically can\u2019t help, however it\u2019s important to value the fact that even though it\u2019s not my fault, my partner has had to pick up my side of the work and deserves some downtime too because he\u2019s had to work more than me. Sounds like Op was just desperate for some downtime, and his girlfriend should be a lot more willing to compromise and consider his needs too. Because yes, while work takes priority, downtime is just as important as work for the work-life balance, and it seems like the girlfriend isn\u2019t taking his feelings and burnout into consideration much.\n\nHe\u2019s waited 1,5 months, I can see why he\u2019d just want to be able to do some gaming.", "YTA. It's work vs play. Work win. Be more supportive with your girlfriend.", "YTA\n\nIf you wanna be childish about it, she called dibs.\n\nIf you can comprehend adult talk, she was making money, you were making yourself happy. Wouldn't have hurt you to find something useful to do for 2 hours.", "YTA. Your actions in this situation raise a red flag regarding your consideration and prioritization of your girlfriend's needs. Despite her clearly expressing the importance of finishing her report in the home office, you chose to prioritize your gaming session and disregarded her request. It's concerning that you didn't see the value in accommodating her work needs, especially considering she had been dealing with medical issues while you had recently gained more free time.\r  \n\r  \nSuggesting that she could work with her laptop anywhere in the apartment may have seemed like a compromise to you, but it's important to recognize that different individuals have different preferences and working environments that contribute to their productivity. By dismissing her request and prioritizing your own leisure activity, you displayed a lack of empathy and consideration for her needs, which is a significant red flag in a relationship. It's crucial to prioritize open communication, mutual respect, and finding compromises that address both partners' needs.", "Priorities aside, some tasks are just harder or more awkward to do on a laptop.\n\nAnd yes, I know you can't game on her laptop either. See all the previous posts about priorities.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t want to finish it, she HAD to finish it.

You didn\u2019t need to game. You think she *wants* to work all day and night on a report? That she hasn\u2019t got other things she\u2019d rather do? It\u2019s her job. When you\u2019re working from home do you prefer to work in a place designed for work? It\u2019s not about having a laptop versus a desktop, it\u2019s about NEEDING to work and wanting to do it in a space you yourself expect to use while you work from home. \n\nDo you think your fun time is more important than her keeping her job? Do you think only you have a valid reason to work in the office because you have a desktop? You appear to be using her laptop to justify undermining how important her being able to do her job - in optimal conditions. You\u2019re disrespectful and blas\u00e9 about her job, and you don\u2019t even try to hide it. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t understand why she\u2019s angry with you? \n\nYTA.", "YTA - Work (especially since she had a deadline of the next day) should always take priority over video games even if she could have worked elsewhere. Some people need that structure of having their workspace separate from their living space, and perhaps your gf is one of them. You should have let her have the office space while you found another way to entertain yourself. Your games still would've been there when she finished the report.", "INFO if you did some gaming in the evening on Tuesday, how is it that you haven't done any gaming in 1.5 months by Wednesday?", "NAH You both have valid reasons for using the room. You just need more creative troubleshooting. What was she doing while you were at the gym? If it was cooking dinner, you could have offered to cook or order takeout for her. Then she could have worked while you were gone. You could have also agreed to an amount of time to use for gaming while she took a break from working.\n\nIf she\u2019s ending up working in the common area, you need to make sure you aren\u2019t constantly in and out distracting her. And there shouldn\u2019t be other distractions like kids or pets \n\nYou two really need a better setup. Do have you some giant double-monitor desk situation? I don\u2019t understand having two monitors if you don\u2019t use two monitors. Get two small desks. The one my kid uses is pretty compact but it holds his monitor, tower, keyboard etc. Two would easily fit even in a small bedroom. Unless you\u2019re also trying to fit a bed in there. \n\nLastly, you don\u2019t say how you ended up being the one using the office. If you had a big fight and said shitty things to get your way, then Y T A.", "INFO why can't you game and she can work in the same room at the same time?", "NAH, you have one room, somebody has to compromise. It's not apparent from this situation alone if it was unfair to either of you. On one hand, it's work for her so you could argue it takes priority. On the other hand, you need to game in that room while she can work in another room with the desktop.", "ESH, two grown adults should be able to figure out an arrangement here.\n\nFurthermore, how to share a home office is \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared to anything that remotely involves children.  If there is even the slimmest possibility that might be in your future, sit down and think about that.", "YTA, you keep making excuses while you \"deserve\" to game - but relationships don't work like this, it won't always be 50/50 on everything. Even if you found the apartment and moved your stuff and killed a dragon in the course, you are not more entitled to your gaming than she is to her work. If she had a deadline and needed some proper work space, you should have let her use the room. Maybe you are both finally enjoying to have some separate space, but you'll need to work around each other.", "YTA.\n\nYes before she did the work wherever she could. But I bet it sucked.  I can edit photos on my laptop but I prefer the chair in the home office.. it also helps me concentrate on the work at hand.  In a different room I can get distracted from doing my task.. in bed I can fall asleep.\n\n And this is really a work vs play issue... Work come first\n\nEven if you had the room for a 2nd desk in there that would be a hard no for me.   I know how gaming folk can get... I use to be one of them lol!   And I know in my prime gaming days I could get loud..\n\n Maybe you should of looked at a place with more rooms of your gaming was going to be a issue with her working.  So you could have a proper office And a separate room for gaming", "Nta to me. you can use the room too. And if your gf can do what needs to be done in her laptop,, then her working there during the day and you gaming for an hour at night sounds definitely fair. Sure, work is more important than gaming, but gaming there for one hour in 24 hours sounds reasonable. And I take you having barely any time in the last months into account for my judgement too. (Also, both using the room if possible sounds like a fair solution. And moving a laptop plus extra screen is definitely easier than moving a whole pc set up.)\n\nEdit: I write reports etc all the time on my laptop, so unless she misses some specific program for it in her laptop, she could certainly do it on her laptop. And yes, it might be nice too give her more comfort, but it sounds like you've been doing most things around the house with moving etc and you deserve comfort too.", "Honestly, I don't see why she couldn't use a different space in the house if a second monitor could have easily been set up......seems weird to me that an argument happened when a reasonable option was available.\n\nDid she give a reason why she absolutely had to use the room??", "I see the PC in the office has \"screens\", IE, multiple screens? Surely neither of you *need* two screens. Why don't you disconnect one screen from the PC so the laptop can use it and keep the other attached? That way you can both have a screen each.", "NTA. At all. You had a reasonable solution to set her up anywhere else with a screen and her laptop. It was a reasonable win-win solution. Exactly what me and hubby would have happily done.\n\nI don't get all the Y T As here. Honestly your logic was thoughtful and was a workable solution for everyone.", "NTA probably because I'm a gamer. That's bs, I think you're already kind enough letting her plug her shit into your monitor tbh it's a laptop, it's meant to move around. If she wanted to stay in the office, I suggest she gets her own desk and monitor or better yet, her own desktop and voila! No need to be upset.\n\nEdit: I also don't understand how it's possible for a room meant to be used as a bedroom to be too small for two desks? Put them back to back in the middle? It's weird but nonetheless, it would fix your issues.", "YTA. Being in other rooms can cause distractions and be uncomfortable for a working situation. \n\nDuring the pandemic my wife hated working from home. She couldn\u2019t get comfortable and the home environment was distracting. \n\nYou need to be focused for work and the office allows that for your GF. She had an important report for the next day and you expect her to do it at a kitchen table or on a couch and focus while being uncomfortable. \n\nYou literally want to game.

She can move with laptop for sure. I wouldn't mind it. Also, why you can't stay in the room at the same time?", "NTA - If you both have to work from home on the same day, she'd have to use a different room.  If you weren't gaming and had a report to write for work instead, she would have had to use a different room. She has a laptop, which gives her more flexibility in what room in the house she can use it, whether for work or just surfing the internet.\n\nYou need to work out some rules. Say, for example, after 9pm on weeknights, if you both want to use your computers at the same time, she uses a different room.", "YTA, the office should have two desks so you can both be in there at the same time. It should be used as an office first, because work is what pays for it all.

It's one night where she had a deadline to meet the next day. While I am sympathetic to you not being able to game (I very much understand the importance and necessity to engage in your hobbies and have down time), I think her work still takes priority. Additionally, as someone who is particular about the space I need to be in to do work, she may specifically want to work in the office to better help with her focus. \n\nI think her reaction wasn't kind and understanding of where you were coming from.

Their healthy legs aren't able to go out of that room with their Laptop", "Noise. If he doesn't have a headset or is prone to yelling \"FAWK\" when he dies, it could be distracting.", "Oh yea I totally forgot that everyone can afford a whole other set up\u2026. It might be a financial thing.", "I think the problem might stem from a lot of people thinking of gaming as a waste of time. I\u2019m a gamer and i\u2019ve been with people who have absolutely no respect for it when its just a hobby like any other. Having no respect for it makes them form a bias against it", "Kinda, though I don't think it's specifically gaming, it's that it's seen as a male past time and the misandry on this sub gets kinda out of control.\n\nTo me it's really absurd that the person trying to compromise is being labelled the asshole while the person who refuses to budge isn't. But it's in line with the general trends on this sub.\n\nIf there was a woman that had been moving house and taking care of her sick boyfriend, then he had work to do and stopped her from doing something she wanted when there was a good compromise, everyone would be unanimous that he was the AH.\n\nSomeone else just posted in a reply to something else I wrote (on another post where the sexism was more blatant) with some evidence of it happening: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ek0qz/comment/jjszsd9/?context=3", "People read the title and one comment and go below and echo chamber it for easy karma.", "If she didn\u2019t have a report due the next day I\u2019d be more inclined to agree but in this case, it\u2019s extenuating circumstances, she needs to get the work done and it will be easier and probably quicker to do in her preferred workspace. If this was like, a constant occurrence then yeah she would need to compromise and trade off but it\u2019s just one night.", "But when he tried to talk to her earlier in the night, she had more time to work on it, as he was still going to the gym, and she said she wasn't sure what time she'd be done. If he went in there and gamed when he got back, she obviously wasn't working, so she was seemingly just trying to monopolize and control access to the room.\n\nOP really should've added that info to the post.", "You\u2019re assuming she wasn\u2019t working when he got back and that he didn\u2019t kick her out of the room. Would love to believe that\u2019s not the case but that also might explain why she was so mad at him. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone excluded key information on an AITA post to make themselves look better lmao \n\nNot saying that definitely happened though. Just that we don\u2019t know. Definitely agree it would have been good for OP to provide a bit more detail around the timeline in the post.", "Thats what I hate about this thread, making wild assumptions and judging off of those instead of being logical and using the information at hand and context clues.\n\nOP was logical in response to comments. I truly don't see him yanking her out of the chair.", "My wife and I have a similar setup. I'm currently looking for a contract, but when I work it's usually on-site. Vs her work is 100% Work from Home. \n\nWe have a double desk, so we have our own 'space' even if it's right next to each other. I game *all the time* while she works, and the only 'rule' is I need to not be loud if she's on a call. \n\nThats it. It's not that hard to share a space.", "To fully separate your spaces it would be ideal if you could turn one of those tables into a gaming setup for yourself and have the second bedroom be an office space for work since it sounds like she works from home a lot.\n\nAs a woman getting married to a gamer, I was definitely resentful when we moved in together into a two bedroom that the second bedroom became essentially his because gaming is too loud and distracting for another person to sit there and work. It's also inconvenient to move the setup and as someone who was working from home via a laptop hooked to a monitor I was the one getting bumped. So he had a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen, and an entire private office space.\n\nIt's common that women don't get their own rooms in a house unless there is a room to spare whereas men get \"man caves\" or dens or gaming rooms or home offices. It's really bullshit and if you have three spaces you should separate them and share them by utility: a room for sleeping, a room for fun, a room for working / focused work.", "Also posture. At the start of the pandemic I was on my laptop on the couch, kitchen bar stool, or small ikea dining table. My back was wrecked at the end of every day. After the first couple of weeks my back hurt even when not working.", "Why would he do that when his gf could just get her OWN monitor? OP shouldn't need back up devices for being locked out of using his own belongings!", "But the reasons he has not been gaming so much lately is not because this problem has been happening a lot, but because they've been in the middle of a move and stressful times.\n\nI would understand if this was something that had happened a lot, but in this instance, she has an important deadline. Unless she has that every week and has to use the office during the evening weekly, I would say her needs are more important here.\n\nBut ideally they should both be able to use the office at the same time, I think the problem is that it's too small for two people at the same time.", "Invested in the move, sure. Invested in his GFs comfort and the relationship in general, not so much. He even says it was a one off request and not the norm due to an urgent work commitment.", "You'll also notice that he said he played Tuesday, so it FELT like a month and a half, but that was not technically true.", "OP is the asshole because he is male, his girlfriend is not the asshole because she is not. Simple as - might as well be a sub rule", "Not JUST the laptop.\n\nHe offered to hook up a monitor for her laptop (as it would be easier to move a monitor for her, than it would be to move all of the P.C. but the monitor that she will use)\n\nStill not great, but I think \"undocked laptop\" is disingenuous", "Probably should have their own computer if it\u2019s that important lol.", "Because her work is a need that had a strict deadline, and his gaming isn\u2019t.", "In this case I would just suggest to get myself a gaming laptop so she can have her room and I can game in any room I want. Win-win.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why people are saying YTA. Did you buy the monitors with your own money? And you offered to set up a monitor for her too? If she needs more than two monitors and table space or whatnot, she can also buy her own if she wants to work outside of work hours. Playing games is still a hobby and people deserve to do their hobbies??? I\u2019m so baffled right now.", "Sometimes, things take longer than we thought. Especially when you've been injured and aren't at 100% yet. And 1.5 hours if he started at 7:30 means that it was after 9 before she could finally get back to the office. That's an hour and a half of severely lessened productivity when she had been working all day and was trying to get things done so she could rest.\n\nAs for the gaming thing- do you genuinely think most people making these comments care? Very few people who say YTA to OP aren't bashing gaming- if he'd kicked her out to watch a movie or do macrame or hang out with his bros their statements would still hold equal logical weight. Many of the people making N T A comments, however, reiterate exactly the point you just made, exaggerate wildly, project a great deal, criticise the people who think listening to your partner's genuine needs are usually a priority over your own wants, and generally act as though it's an unusual thing for a partner to expect that the occasional work deadline be prioritized over their partner's hobbies. \n\nIt doesn't matter what your hobbies are- if your partner tells you they need something for a specific and unusual occassion and your response is \"no\" followed by a 'compromise' that is incredibly lopsided in your favor so they'll go away and let you have fun, you are acting like a dick.", "It might be due early in the morning, and some people actually function worse after sleeping because brains are weird and some take a while to get going lol.  If it's a choice between working through the night and then crashing and being able to actually relax, or trying (and possibly failing) to sleep for a couple hours before having to get up and rush to finish, many people choose the former.\n\nIt's  a reasonable requests in most cases, but most partners recognize that \"I have a deadline\" means \"this need to be a priority for this temporary period,\" because long term relationships generally mean that someone will have emergencies/need that go beyond the normal routine and part of committing to each other is agreeing to that so long as it doesn't get excessive. There's no evidence in the post that this is a repeating pattern of behavior, and any assertions that it is are assumptions based on no actual evidence and countered by some of the evidence in the post.\n\nAnd it's quite posisble that she's making up for lost time- if she's been out for literal weeks unable to work/to work properly, then it's not unreasonable that she might be running up against deadlines. Especially if she works in a field where her job has clients with external deadlines/obligations.", "Totally agree that finding wasy to work things out is more important than who the AH is! People make mistakes, and this is a pretty understandable one, but acting out a little sometimes doesn't make you a bad person :)\n\nI hope OP and his GF have lots of luck figuring things out and a long and happy relationship!", "....Not really. I mean, you can make the assumption that people would change their comments obviously, but if you read the TEXT of the comments and apply that equally, it works just as well reguardless of the genders and what the hobby is. \n\nSure, some people might only be saying it because they're sympathetic in this instance, just like you could only be saying this comment because you've never had a long term relationship where you've shared space or because you're sexist. You could be, but I don't know you or how you might be hypothetically different, so I can only judge you on the text of your comment. And the text of your comment seems wildly incorrect given that most YTA comments are more about \"work has to take priority over hobbies when there are imminent deadlines\" and \"you need to listen to your partner rather than assuming your desires are always the mosst important thing\" and \"you guys should work on your communication and space sharing going forward\"\n\nThe only people who are bringging gender or gaming into it are N T A comments complaining about the YTA verdict- which even the OP recognized as accurate once he'd had time to calm down, think things through, and look at viewpoints other than his own", "Voluntary overtime is voluntary. Projects you have to finish to meet deadlines that aren't yours to define and might be external to your company that you haven't been able to complete because you have medical issues are, in fact, not voluntary if you'd like to keep your job\n\nAnd no, the fact that she needed at least one extra screen enough that he had to set one up for her means that it cannot 'easily' be done anywhere", "Maybe it's because she's been sick for 3 weeks and she's catching up. Maybe something came up at the last minute. We really can't know why she had such a tight deadline, only that she did."]}
