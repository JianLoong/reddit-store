The big one we sleep in, the small one we use as an office/gaming room. I have a huge desktop computer which I use both for home office once a week, while she hooks up her work laptop to the screens and uses it for home office 2-3x a week.\n\nThe home office has one big desktop computer. This is my own personal computer I've bought with my own money. I use it for work and for gaming. She has her own work laptops. She does not use my desktop computer. She connects her work laptops to one of the monitors in there.\n\nMonday she worked there for home office.\n\nTuesday I used it for home office, as well as some gaming in the evening.\n\nWednesday, again she used it for home office while I went to the office. She said she also wanted to use it in the evning to do more work, to which I said I want to use it to game tonight for a couple hours. Mind you, the past 3 weeks I've spent all my time moving us into this house, while she's been down due to medical issues. Finally I have a little bit of free time again and I haven't been able to do any gaming for atleast 1,5 months.\n\nHeres how I see it:We both had something we wanted to do.\n\nShe wanted to do some extra work in the evening\n\nI wanted to do some gaming for 1-2 hours\n\nHow could we best reach that goal for both of us where both of us get what we want?\n\nShe has a laptop, very easy to just take that to the livingroom/bedroom and I could get her monitor for her so she could work anywhere she wants.\n\nFor me to unplug the desktop, and other accessories (keyboard, mouse, headset) would be a lot of hassle, compared to the little amount of work needed to set up her laptop literally anywhere in the apartment.\n\nKeep in mind, moving in to this place has drastically increased the standard of our living situation, as we used to live in a tiny one room aparment 310sqft for a year, and we both quite enjoy having an office room. Usually she's the one that uses the room the most during the week due to home office, while I tend to use it for gaming. It's been a little more gaming than usual for me lately as I haven't been able to do it at all for the past months due to life stresses.\n\nI ended up using it, and she got very angry with me saying I'm a selfish asshole, even though she was home in the room all day, and I ended up playing for 1,5 hours.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add something: The work she wanted to do was to finish up a report that had to be done for the next day, she said it was important. I still don't see why it has to be done specifically in the office room when it can be done anywhere with a laptop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for everyone replying. It seems I am the asshole and I was unempathetic towards my girlfriend. I will be working on that and be more understand to her needs in the future and make a plan so that we can both be happy.

For example, it would be a no-no for me to work in the bed.\n\n\nI also agree with those saying that working is more important than gaming. It's what it is.\n\nI hate too small houses because of that. You are not set up in a house that is comfortable for two people doing WFH.", "YTA, work comes first and you could just have waited for her to finish before starting your gaming. To avoid this in the future, maybe make a weekly schedule of who needs the room and at what hours.", "YTA\n\nNot just for forcing her to work while you play but for even posting this and then fighting with everyone that does not agree with you.", "Did she want to do more work, or did she need to catch up because she's fallen behind because of her medical issues?

She had a time frame to work in. You can game at any point for any amount of time on any day. \n\nA home office is a home office. Why should she be expected to work somewhere else to do necessary work so you can play games in the home office? I understand its not a priority for you because its not your work, but its hers. And that should mean you take her work as seriously as she does.", "Info: does she pay half the rent?", "YTA. What are you, five? She had deadline.", "ESH\nIt sounds like she had a good work flow going and wanted to finish her important report that was due the next day but her reaction was a bit over the top. \n\nPersonally, work is more important and I would've just waited til later that night or tomorrow to game, if you'd gone a month and a half another day wouldn't have killed you.", "ESH - even though I think the Op should have prioritised her work, I\u2019m looking at the whole picture. It\u2019s pretty clear that Op has been shouldering the larger brunt of the work at home due to her medical issues, and has been consumed so much by work that he hasn\u2019t been given a lot of down time. \n\nBurn out is a pretty clear risk here, and I say this as someone with an autoimmune condition - sometimes I need to be cut some slack because I physically can\u2019t help, however it\u2019s important to value the fact that even though it\u2019s not my fault, my partner has had to pick up my side of the work and deserves some downtime too because he\u2019s had to work more than me. Sounds like Op was just desperate for some downtime, and his girlfriend should be a lot more willing to compromise and consider his needs too. Because yes, while work takes priority, downtime is just as important as work for the work-life balance, and it seems like the girlfriend isn\u2019t taking his feelings and burnout into consideration much.\n\nHe\u2019s waited 1,5 months, I can see why he\u2019d just want to be able to do some gaming.", "YTA.

Wouldn't have hurt you to find something useful to do for 2 hours.", "YTA. Your actions in this situation raise a red flag regarding your consideration and prioritization of your girlfriend's needs. Despite her clearly expressing the importance of finishing her report in the home office, you chose to prioritize your gaming session and disregarded her request. It's concerning that you didn't see the value in accommodating her work needs, especially considering she had been dealing with medical issues while you had recently gained more free time.\r  \n\r  \nSuggesting that she could work with her laptop anywhere in the apartment may have seemed like a compromise to you, but it's important to recognize that different individuals have different preferences and working environments that contribute to their productivity. By dismissing her request and prioritizing your own leisure activity, you displayed a lack of empathy and consideration for her needs, which is a significant red flag in a relationship. It's crucial to prioritize open communication, mutual respect, and finding compromises that address both partners' needs.", "Priorities aside, some tasks are just harder or more awkward to do on a laptop.\n\nAnd yes, I know you can't game on her laptop either.

You didn\u2019t need to game. You think she *wants* to work all day and night on a report? That she hasn\u2019t got other things she\u2019d rather do? It\u2019s her job. When you\u2019re working from home do you prefer to work in a place designed for work? It\u2019s not about having a laptop versus a desktop, it\u2019s about NEEDING to work and wanting to do it in a space you yourself expect to use while you work from home. \n\nDo you think your fun time is more important than her keeping her job? Do you think only you have a valid reason to work in the office because you have a desktop? You appear to be using her laptop to justify undermining how important her being able to do her job - in optimal conditions. You\u2019re disrespectful and blas\u00e9 about her job, and you don\u2019t even try to hide it. \n\nAnd you can\u2019t understand why she\u2019s angry with you? \n\nYTA.", "YTA - Work (especially since she had a deadline of the next day) should always take priority over video games even if she could have worked elsewhere. Some people need that structure of having their workspace separate from their living space, and perhaps your gf is one of them. You should have let her have the office space while you found another way to entertain yourself. Your games still would've been there when she finished the report.", "INFO if you did some gaming in the evening on Tuesday, how is it that you haven't done any gaming in 1.5 months by Wednesday?", "NAH You both have valid reasons for using the room. You just need more creative troubleshooting. What was she doing while you were at the gym? If it was cooking dinner, you could have offered to cook or order takeout for her. Then she could have worked while you were gone. You could have also agreed to an amount of time to use for gaming while she took a break from working.\n\nIf she\u2019s ending up working in the common area, you need to make sure you aren\u2019t constantly in and out distracting her. And there shouldn\u2019t be other distractions like kids or pets \n\nYou two really need a better setup. Do have you some giant double-monitor desk situation? I don\u2019t understand having two monitors if you don\u2019t use two monitors. Get two small desks. The one my kid uses is pretty compact but it holds his monitor, tower, keyboard etc. Two would easily fit even in a small bedroom. Unless you\u2019re also trying to fit a bed in there. \n\nLastly, you don\u2019t say how you ended up being the one using the office. If you had a big fight and said shitty things to get your way, then Y T A.", "INFO why can't you game and she can work in the same room at the same time?", "NAH, you have one room, somebody has to compromise. It's not apparent from this situation alone if it was unfair to either of you. On one hand, it's work for her so you could argue it takes priority. On the other hand, you need to game in that room while she can work in another room with the desktop.", "ESH, two grown adults should be able to figure out an arrangement here.\n\nFurthermore, how to share a home office is \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared to anything that remotely involves children.  If there is even the slimmest possibility that might be in your future, sit down and think about that.", "YTA, you keep making excuses while you \"deserve\" to game - but relationships don't work like this, it won't always be 50/50 on everything. Even if you found the apartment and moved your stuff and killed a dragon in the course, you are not more entitled to your gaming than she is to her work. If she had a deadline and needed some proper work space, you should have let her use the room. Maybe you are both finally enjoying to have some separate space, but you'll need to work around each other.", "YTA.\n\nYes before she did the work wherever she could. But I bet it sucked.  I can edit photos on my laptop but I prefer the chair in the home office.. it also helps me concentrate on the work at hand.  In a different room I can get distracted from doing my task.. in bed I can fall asleep.\n\n And this is really a work vs play issue... Work come first\n\nEven if you had the room for a 2nd desk in there that would be a hard no for me.   I know how gaming folk can get... I use to be one of them lol!   And I know in my prime gaming days I could get loud..\n\n Maybe you should of looked at a place with more rooms of your gaming was going to be a issue with her working.  So you could have a proper office And a separate room for gaming", "Nta to me. you can use the room too. And if your gf can do what needs to be done in her laptop,, then her working there during the day and you gaming for an hour at night sounds definitely fair. Sure, work is more important than gaming, but gaming there for one hour in 24 hours sounds reasonable. And I take you having barely any time in the last months into account for my judgement too. (Also, both using the room if possible sounds like a fair solution. And moving a laptop plus extra screen is definitely easier than moving a whole pc set up.)\n\nEdit: I write reports etc all the time on my laptop, so unless she misses some specific program for it in her laptop, she could certainly do it on her laptop. And yes, it might be nice too give her more comfort, but it sounds like you've been doing most things around the house with moving etc and you deserve comfort too.", "Honestly, I don't see why she couldn't use a different space in the house if a second monitor could have easily been set up......seems weird to me that an argument happened when a reasonable option was available.\n\nDid she give a reason why she absolutely had to use the room??", "I see the PC in the office has \"screens\", IE, multiple screens? Surely neither of you *need* two screens. Why don't you disconnect one screen from the PC so the laptop can use it and keep the other attached? That way you can both have a screen each.", "NTA. At all. You had a reasonable solution to set her up anywhere else with a screen and her laptop. It was a reasonable win-win solution. Exactly what me and hubby would have happily done.\n\nI don't get all the Y T As here. Honestly your logic was thoughtful and was a workable solution for everyone.", "NTA probably because I'm a gamer. That's bs, I think you're already kind enough letting her plug her shit into your monitor tbh it's a laptop, it's meant to move around. If she wanted to stay in the office, I suggest she gets her own desk and monitor or better yet, her own desktop and voila! No need to be upset.\n\nEdit: I also don't understand how it's possible for a room meant to be used as a bedroom to be too small for two desks? Put them back to back in the middle? It's weird but nonetheless, it would fix your issues.", "YTA.

She couldn\u2019t get comfortable and the home environment was distracting. \n\nYou need to be focused for work and the office allows that for your GF. She had an important report for the next day and you expect her to do it at a kitchen table or on a couch and focus while being uncomfortable. \n\nYou literally want to game.

She needs to compromise. NTA.", "NTA. You are NOT the asshole here, even though the internet has strongarmed you into believing so yourself, by cussing you out and massively downvoting your every comment. The asshole in this situation is the girlfriend, with her uncompromising attitude to any of the various solutions you suggested.

Also, why you can't stay in the room at the same time?", "NTA - If you both have to work from home on the same day, she'd have to use a different room.  If you weren't gaming and had a report to write for work instead, she would have had to use a different room. She has a laptop, which gives her more flexibility in what room in the house she can use it, whether for work or just surfing the internet.\n\nYou need to work out some rules.

It's one night where she had a deadline to meet the next day. I think you'd be fine without one night of gaming. Additionally, as someone who is particular about the space I need to be in to do work, she may specifically want to work in the office to better help with her focus. \n\nWhile I don't disagree with her calling you selfish in this instance, calling you an asshole was a bit much. \n\nMild ESH but mostly you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She used that same table for more than 1 year in the old apartment for work when we lived there and I didn't have anything at all. That was her old apartment and I moved in there with her while my shit stayed in my old one.", "Because you didn\u2019t have a dedicated office space?  I bet had she complained about it, you would be kvetching about how whinny she was.", "And if she is on a deadline working at night she probably needs more focus than usual.\n\nWhy are you trying to argue with your gf about what she needs for work? Why don\u2019t you trust that it is important and let her work?", "Where did you game before? You say there was no separate room so she was fine with the kitchen table. But didn\u2019t the same apply to you?", "NTA . Your GF is creating a power issue out of nothing. She can easily work on the report on the laptop . There is no need for a external monitor to complete a report . She can also choose to make that report after your time is up . \n\nShe is clearly making the report after regular office hours since you are back from work by that time. Why is that ?", "It became an issue because now she has better options. When you are in a tiny 310 sq foot place, you make do even if you hate it. Now there is a proper office, and sorry, I agree with other that work takes priority in a home office.\n\nI also hate the \u201cshe\u2019s easier to move so she gets the short stick\u201d because this means everytime you have conflict she is going to have move out of the presumably more comfortable place where she already has her set up. That\u2019s not great and if I was her I would straight up say so.", "Not necessarily. \nJust because the laptop is portable, it doesn't mean she'd be able to get work done sitting on the couch or in bed. Perhaps she focuses better when in the office room? Or maybe it's more comfortable because there's a desk?", "Working in an unergonomic setup like that is how people screw up their necks and back.", "Laptops can be awful to work on, especially if you're trying to do a big document like a report. Just taking a laptop elsewhere is not a reasonable alternative to using the actual proper desk which is set up for that purpose.\n\nI'm sorry you didn't get to game, I'm a gamer and I know how disappointing it is when you expect to get that relaxation time and you don't, but her work should have taken priority.", "YTA work comes first.", "People learn a lot about each other living together, more than they do from the dating phase. Your gf just got a whole new insight into your bs. YTA", "Work on a computer needs to be done at a desk with a separate keyboard/mouse and a monitor that's at least eye level at the top. \n\nPaid work trumps unpaid gaming hobbiy time.", "Maybe you can find the space in your office for a second work place. Buy a docking station for her laptop with a keyboard, mouse and a monitor connected to it and she doesn't always have to use part of your setup. She can just plug her laptop into the docking station and has a fully functioning work setup.", "Ok so I think \n\n1) work is more important than play and there was a time crunch for her\n\n2) she\u2019s earning money that helps pay for a shared bill so her doing so helps you too \n\n3) if she helps pay the bills she is entitled to use the space, regardless of the screens and who owns them\n\nLook I get it, you were looking forward to having some time to yourself and gaming but you have to bend a little with this. \n\nSoft YTA", "I get that she could've moved. I'm also saying you could've just waited to game. She had an important deadline and is obviously more comfortable in this office room. You could've just waited another day.\n\nThis whole thing is really petty tbh", "Why again is YOUR PLAY more important than HER WORK?", "It seems like by your second edit, you're going to try and fix things, which is great.\n\nBut just a little 2 cents. While I understand you really want to game, extending some support and understanding for your girlfriend's work goes a long way. It's not a hill worth dying on since a relationship is all about working together, as a team. If this is an expression of a bigger issue, then that's another story. Is there a bigger issue?", "Some tasks are much harder using one, smaller screen, and a smaller keyboard, too.", "That doesn't answer the question tho. Why can't you both be in the \"office\" at the same time?", "You keep not seeing the true problem and just mention how its more of a hassle to move your desktop vs her laptop\n\nI can understand why she gave u silent treatment esp if your saying the same to gf repeatedly", "You did not answer my question, did you use it specifically in the time frame she asked to use it?", "I agree with you.", "Then NTA.\n\nShe had space to work from easily.\n\nIt is not your fault or problem that she didn\u2019t get her work finished while at work/during work hours.", "What..? That was her apartment, she chose herself to live there. I can't take responsibility for which apartment she signs papers on before I've even met her.\n\nEdit: We are NOT living in her apartment now. That was before we moved into this new one with two bedrooms.", "Hm. I'm not sure. After I told her I would be using the room after the gym, she started giving me the silent treatment all night and has been acting cold, saying I'm a selfish asshole, which is why I'm even posting in the first place.", "Ok I can see that one. Thanks for the perspective, it makes sense. I didn't understand why she was so upset and it just didn't click in my head. I'll work on finding a solution together.", "There is no space, there's also a bed in there.", "She didn't give me a specific time that she wanted to use it. She just said \"after work\". I asked after dinner and she said she didn't know.", "Oh\u2026so what your saying is that YOU moved into HER apartment and now expect her to give up working comfortably so you can play a game?  \n\nAre you like 14?", "Glad to have helped! :) honestly coming to an understanding in a situation like this is far more important than who the AH is. If you two managed to make things work in 310 sq feet, I\u2019m certain you can figure something out here.", "Do you guys consider getting rid of that extra bed?", "Soft YTA\n\nWork is more important than gaming", "No, we are now in a new apartment. I'm talking about how it was BEFORE we moved into this one. Here's the rundown:\n\nWe lived separetely. I \"moved\" into hers with no items. Then we both in the last month moved into a new apartment with two bedrooms.", "No hes saying that he has no control over her old apartment. They both moved out of separate apartments into a larger one together.", "so she had a shitty working situation in her own apartment, so she should continue having one to work now ?"]}
