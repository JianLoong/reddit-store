Your feelings are justified, but you do need to exhibit self-control if you're going to decline this gift and avoid a scene. Having your parents tell your sister ahead of time that you would prefer not to receive a gift from her is probably the best way to avoid Christmas day ending unpleasantly. \n\nHave you considered that your sister has started to grow up and realise the impact her actions have had on you, and this gift is her way of trying to reach out to you and get to a place where she can sincerely apologise?

They chose to adopt your nephew and ignore you.  That's on them.  It's completely doable to have a teen kid and a newborn and meet emotional needs of both.

If she hasn't, good riddance.", "NTA\n\nListen, much of what your sister did and went through caused damage. She should be given a chance to grow, mature, and change, but part of that would involve acknowledging that her actions harmed others. Would your parents consider funding family therapy for you two? My husband got some therapy with his sister at one time, and I think it's an excellent idea if you want to work out anger and resentment and have a chance at actually repairing a siblings' relationship. I wouldn't take the gift as fake. It's a poor attempt at normalizing a damaged relationship.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you just have christmas somewhere else?", "NTA.  Just ignore the existence of the present and just keep on walking.  Your feelings are yours and no one should tell you how to feel.  \n\nIf your parents give you trouble ask them the following questions.\n\nHas she ever really apologized for all the damage she did to the family? \n\nHas she ever acknowledged that her actions had consequences for others?\n\nI asked this because my aunt was a drug addict and for all I know she is still be a drug addict. 2 years ago she informed me that she didn't remember horribly abusing me and my brother and therefore it didn't happen.  To add insult to injury a day after she displayed each and every one of the behaviors on the narcissist prayer, she tried to borrow $600 bucks that she promised she would have back to me by next month so I can pay my rent.   She wonders why I never pick up the phone when she calls and I unfriended her on all social media.  \n\nIt sounds like your parents vacillated between trying to control your sister and enabling her behavior.  My biggest fear is that they're going to accept that all the bad times are behind them and she's is turned around her life and everything's going to be wonderful. Take it from somebody who's been dealing with a family member who went down this road, very few people stick it out when life gets too hard.\n\nI hate to tell you this but you might be the good kid. The good kid is the one that did everything right trying to get their love and approval. They didn't cause trouble in school, they got good grades, and helped out or got jobs.

Their excuse would likely be your easy to ignore cuz you didn't need them as much as your sister did.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to feel the way you feel about your sister, I'd feel the same.

But you can't rule out that she grew as a person. Apologising is hard for some people. Maybe insisting on the personal note in the wallet why she wants to rebuild a relationship?

I said, \"We never talk and you never want to hang out and catch up, so why bother getting a gift and pretend we care?\".\n\nWhat's the moral here? Idk, since it's a similar but also different dynamic.
