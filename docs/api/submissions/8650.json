It can be very insensitive. \n\nHowever, I wish you\u2019d take a moment to think about why there are so many women in thread commiserating and giving examples of how this has affected them personally. Is it because you are one of those men who think women are overly hysterical and emotional and take everything oh so personally? Or do you think that perhaps there is a context here, where for generations women have been seen as the lesser sex whose job it is to be pleasant  and have little value unless they\u2019re existing to make a man\u2019s life better. Yes, things are much better now than they were a generation or two ago. But to say things are equal now is still laughable. There is still a lot of misogyny, both conscious and internalized, that women contend with on a regular basis. And oftentimes being told by a man that they should be smiling is a throwback to this idea that women need to be pleasant all the time.

Or geez, what\u2019s wrong with you? (Or imagine being a woman who is experiencing any emotion that\u2019s not calm and pleasant and being asked, Christ, are you on your period or something? Like being upset or angry  or annoyed could only be justified by hormones.) \n\nThe fact of the matter is that this is a constant experience for women, and we\u2019re allowed to be upset about it.

Older men think they have control over women, and when they tell women to smile they\u2019re exercising that power/control. IMHO, you calmly stood your ground and refused to allow him to control you. He got uncomfortable because you didn\u2019t conform to his wishes, and that\u2019s what others are responding to, which is completely fucked up if you ask me. The old guy is the asshole for even having the audacity to tell you to smile, for no reason other than his own opinion of you. Fuck that guy and everyone who disagrees with you, sincerely.", "This happened to me all the time. You couldn\u2019t walk around smiling even if you felt like it, because random creeps would be certain that it meant you adored them. One time, some guy just wouldn\u2019t let up: \u201cSmile, baby! Come on, just one little smile won\u2019t hurt ya\u2026let me see that pretty smile, honey! \u201c I turned around and let him have it: \u201c Well, my mom just told me she has cancer, my dog got hit by a car, and I am going to have to declare bankruptcy! I just have so much to smile about, right?\u201dHe shut up and slinked away.", "Being told to smile by a stranger is incredibly awkward, uncomfortable, and sometimes a little creepy. You were just returning the favor. NTA.", "Imagine if this was worded honestly.\n\n\u201cChange your face to be more visually appealing to me. Whatever your feelings are, they can\u2019t possibly justify the fact that your face is displeasing to my eye.\u201d", "YTA. What were you trying to prove? Especially if he was older, it\u2019s a thing they say. I don\u2019t like it either, but whatever. Walking around with a chip on your shoulder over every interaction is childish and stupid. Grow up.", "YTA....SMILE", "NTA for sure\n\nThe only problem here is work environment. I guess OP does have to listen to the boss\n\nBut you didn't do anything wrong OP. Men who do this are creepy. It's gross being told to smile by a stranger. I'm glad there's been some pushback against this old fashioned trend", "Also...maybe look into a set of gross halloween dentures..something with blacked out and yellow teeth...keep them handy and next time slip them in and give the creep your best smile", "NTA - People who tell other people to smile, not knowing what they are going through is just straight up rude.", "for OP if both parents still alive.\n\nThy can opt to use Grandparent or great-grandparent(doesn't matter if said GGP died before OP's birth)", "Exactly.  Bob is NOT OP's friend.  Tell him nothing other than platitudes.", "Bobs normally super chill, im surprised he snitched on me.", "I doubt bob would do anything to make me unsafe, but im not telling him anything in the future", "Yeah your right. Ill behave better if that happens again, but man ppl make it hard to be nice", "Id definitely get written up if i said that lmao", "   If that's actually a thing older people often say, then im glad that generation will be mostly gone within the next 10-15 years.", "Why should i?", "That's exactly my response to the smile police! I like the wide eyed, slow spreading smile from Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun video...nothing makes people beat feet away from me faster", "I used to do this when I worked retail. I would do that big ol' fake retail smile but let it slowly spread. \n\nI did get written up for it because \"customers shouldn't have to tell you to smile.\" It was a whole argument from there. \n\nRetail is hell, make rude customers uncomfortable.", "This OP - I\u2019ve gotten the \u201csmile, it makes you so much prettier!\u201d a few times when I was in my 20\u2019s, and God now I wish I\u2019d watched the movie \u201cSmile\u201d back then. Google the movie promo and copy that smile, guarantee he\u2019ll never say that to another woman again!", "And slowly tilt your head from side to side", "Ooh, I love the Wednesday Addams smile from Reunion!", "Also, never share with Bob again. And be careful in the future which men around you are allies against misogyny or are complicit.", "I don\u2019t think smiling is in any job description other than maybe flight attendant", "No one cares about your opinion lol", "Bobs normally super chill, i never thought hed be the type to snitch. Ill be more careful from now on", "You've said that gender plays a role.\n\nHow so?\n\nAre you saying that it's 100% OK for a woman to tell another woman to smile, but it's not OK for a man to tell another man to smile?\n\nI'm arguing that unsolicited instructions to smile are unacceptable when given by anyone, to anyone.  But you seem to suggest that some people are allowed, while others aren't.\n\nAffixing gender here isn't necessary to address the OP's concern.", "Then I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve never worked in food or hospitality, at least not in the US. \u201cService with a smile\u201d is quite specifically in most descriptions of job expectations, especially if you\u2019re working front cash or drive, or as a server, or as a front desk worker anywhere. Sorry that I don\u2019t have screenshots of my decade-old enrollment paperwork for you, but anyone who\u2019s done the job can attest.\n\nEven if it were only flight attendants, as you\u2019re seeming to suggest (which, again, it isn\u2019t) it would still be unfair to workers to be expected to put up with the amount of abuse that customer-facing positions catch.", "No, I'm a customer, just give me whatever I asked for and I'll pay. You don't have to fake being my friend or anything. Like, it's fine if they smile but it's also fine if they don't.", "Good. Glad to hear he\u2019s not bothering you anymore. So sorry for your great loss.", "Tell him any time he\u2019s confused about what\u2019s appropriate to say to a strange woman, to imagine a much larger, threatening looking strange man, saying the same to him. \n\nOR, you know, respect you and your experience enough to believe you when you tell him what you\u2019ve experienced.", "I dont care if anyone cares. Ill say stuff anyway", "She would have blown a gasket at my family! My parents brought all 8 of us kids in stores all the time. We had a system where we all put our hands behind our back as we came in the store, and just didn't touch anything without permission.", "Bob\u2019s the AH.", "You're my hero. The end. Never change. I will adopt this method for all future unwanted encounters. Harness my inner Aubrey Plaza. Stare and stare hard.", "NTA I would of stared back and said my pet hamster died.", "NTA. He made you uncomfortable. You made him uncomfortable back. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him.", "I had a guy tell me that I\u2019d \u201cbe prettier if I smiled\u201dwhile I was at work. I told him, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be pretty. I\u2019m trying to be professional and do my job.\u201d  Ugh", "NTA your error was telling Bob, who straight away tried to get you in trouble with management. Fuck the Bobs and the creep strangers that demand niceness.", "Nta.  If it happens again you should do the same thing.  Now you know not to tell your coworkers is all.", "NTA and I\u2019m proud of you! Last time some old dude told me to smile it took me so off guard I freaking did\u2026 and I\u2019m still irritated at myself for it. Like my people pleasing knee jerk reaction was to just do it when my feminist bad ass side would have loved to have told him to go pound sand.", "You didnt mention it....but let me guess, you are female? You are NTA, and OF COURSE Bob sided with the customer...\ud83d\ude12 \n\nSeriously men, STOP TELLING US TO SMILE. JUST STOP.", "Amazing. NTA. I\u2019m a guy and the two times in my life people have told me to \u201csmile, it\u2019s not that bad\u201d have made me so fucking angry\u2014 and being a bigger guy there\u2019s no implicit power dynamic against me but it still pissed me off so bad. Woman deal with so much bullshit.", "NTA", "Well, don't tell Bob anything in the future, he sucks and is a narc.", "NTA and I am cackling. I can't wait to try this out.", "Lol I absolutely hate being told to smile. Can't do it 100% of the time! Sometimes I'm deep into an article or reading something in general, do I REALLY have to smile at my computer screen for 8 fucking hours... no. I smile when you're in front of me and actually need something from me.", "NTA, I appreciate your response.", "> an older customer appeared out of nowhere to tell me I should smile because its not that bad.\n\nIt's likely that he thought you looked sad and this was his attempt to cheer you up - and clearly, it backfired.", "Geez people are so fucking miserable now...I get it can be annoying or odd for someone to ask to smile but ffs everyone is acting like its some sort of personal attack.  Either smile or walk off.  And yes...I have had it said to me plenty of times by men and women...", "They would think she was an idiot if she was smiling away while working. Who believes you should be smiling 100% of the time? Controlling, misogynistic men, that's who. NTA", "No even better  smile like the smiling man that so much better that Get him to shutup about smiling  and Bob is a snitch \ud83d\ude12", "I like doing the troll face smile for those ones, just don\u2019t break eye contact and keep up the smile while also walking away. \ud83d\ude43", ":'(", "Yes they do. Some weeks multiple times, some weeks none. Just averaging it out. Doesn't matter if you believe me or not. Point still stands, both genders do it. It's a well intentioned, minor annoyance.", "Why does everything have to be about sex? I would assume most people are doing it to cheer someone up. Never crossed my mind that it was done out of creepiness. We see what we want to see I guess.", "Yeah, it sucks to have to do that extra mental gymnastics, but he has proven to not only not be an ally, but he is also a snitch for telling your boss.", "No, I\u2019m not suggesting that anyone is allowed. It\u2019s not appropriate irrespective of gender.\n\nBut women tend to get it a *lot* more, especially from men. (And especially, as described, from older men to younger women.) And thus there are two ways in which gender comes into play: that women are often really completely sick of getting these comments and so have a harder time brushing individual ones off, and that some men seem to not realize that they\u2019re making these comments (and so need to pay more attention to how they treat people, especially women). \n\nTo de-normalize the problematic comment, in the hopes of putting a stop to it for everyone, it takes harder pushback in some directions than others.", "Correct I haven\u2019t worked in food or hospitality service, but your comment said customer facing, and I have had those jobs.  I wish people didn\u2019t have to smile for their jobs", "Sure, Jan.", "That much is clear from this interaction as well as the one you posted about. Shows how little class you have.", "I believe we need to drop any gender bias that we have before we can make progress.  Calling out one gender and focusing on \"them\" is divisive, and causes people to entrench into their own gender-biases.  It's lose-lose.\n\nI still stand with the OP.  They're NTA, because their reaction was a direct response, on-par with the unsolicited order to \"smile\".", "Aww aren't you just so sassy and cute.\n\nFeel free to keep seeing imaginary predators around every corner. Sounds healthy to me.", "I don't see any need to act classy to rude individuals", "What\u2019s even weirder is in what world does every person have a living father still? Imagine how utterly destroying that would have been if they recently lost their father.", "Imaginary predators? Did you stretch before that leap?"]}
