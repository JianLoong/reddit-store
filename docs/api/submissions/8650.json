No one has ever randomly told me to smile before so I didn\u2019t really know how to react. I wanted to say something snarky but I didn\u2019t want to get written up, so I decided to just make direct eye contact with him until he went away. It was really awkward to be honest but after a moment he left. Also the look on his face when I refused to smile at him was a bit funny in hindsight.\n\n   Anyways, I told my coworker \u201cbob\u201d about that, and he said I should have just walked away instead of creepily staring, and I probably made the customer feel uncomfortable. Bob told our boss, and she didn\u2019t get me in trouble, but she told me to just walk away in the future and not to stare at the customers. I told two of my friends about it, and one of them said I was equally as creepy as the customer for staring.  \n\n\n   If that happens again I probably will just walk away since my boss told me not to do that, or just not tell bob about anything I do, but In principle, AITA for staring at that guy?", "created_utc": 1675038970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10onqta/aita_for_creepily_staring_at_a_guy_who_told_me_to/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But practically speaking, if your boss says walk away, walk away.", "NTAA coworker told me ,\" smile, it's not that bad\". He had come down from a different shop and didn't know it was my first day back at work after my child's funeral.  Two people who knew my situation reported him to management.  That started a sh!t show because he tried to get revenge.  I like your reaction better.", "NTA, I\u2019m guessing \u2018Bob\u2019 has never been told to smile by a stranger in his place of work before. I doubt smiling is a core component of your job.", "NTA - you responded appropriately, but don't expect men to have your back on this", "NTA, every time we make someone that tells us to smile feel awkward, it\u2019s a public service. Catch me on the wrong day and I just might trauma dump, keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA - why does everyone seem to think it\u2019s your responsibility to consider some random creep\u2019s feelings/comfort-level, after he went out of his way to be inconsiderate of yours? I can\u2019t stand men/people/anyone who think it\u2019s their place to tell someone else to smile. They don\u2019t know you or what\u2019s going on in your head/life. I would have stared back until he left, too. Your coworker, \u201cbob\u201d, sounds like the same type of creep, if he\u2019s feeling concerned for the customer\u2019s \u201csense of comfort\u201d.", "NTA. Maybe the customer did feel uncomfortable, but perhaps that helped them learn a valuable lesson. \n\nPeople telling others they need to smile is a real pet hate of mine. You have no idea what is going on in someone\u2019s life so saying \u2018smile it\u2019s not that bad\u2019 isn\u2019t appropriate. You don\u2019t owe anyone a smile.", "NTA. Fully support creepy prolonged eye contact in response to this behaviour and honestly I\u2019m kind of jealous that I\u2019ve never thought to do this when some AH has told me to smile.", "NTA. There is such a strong gender bias with this. I\u2019ve never encountered a man who has been told by a random stranger that they should smile but so many women have. Not saying no one has ever told a man to smile; just that I\u2019ve never heard of it happening. My point is most men won\u2019t really fully understand why/how it\u2019s annoying.\n\nI once had someone tell me to smile because it wasn\u2019t that bad and it was while I was taking the bus home so I could shower before returning to the hospital to be with my son, so yes, it was that bad and dude was all \u201coh, well, how would I have known that?\u201d when I told him. Yes, that\u2019s exactly the point, random dude. You don\u2019t know so stop telling people to freaking smile.", "Bob can go fuck himself.

You are a woman right?  The guy was a sexist creep.  You gave him what he deserved - a death stare.  Keep up the good work.", "NTA and I love your reaction.", "NTA\n\nI have resting bitch face and get this comment often. I will be grocery shopping or walking down the street so why would I randomly be smiling for no reason at no one. I always find it creepy and I hear it as \"you would be more attractive to me if you smile\" which implies I give a shit what random strangers think of me.", "NTA\n\nHere's why: abusive people tell you to smile (controlling and not caring how you feel so long as they get what they want).  Good people give you a reason to (empathy and making your day better if you had a bad one).\n\nYour reaction was on point. You weren't rude. You didn't submit. You made a silent point.\n\nEdit: some also use it to see if you will easily comply and they can then come back and get you to comply with other stuff including getting in situations you would later regret. It can be predator testing prey.\n\n\nWhat's that meme.. my boss said I intimidate my co-workers so I stared at him until he walked away.\n\nI love that meme.", "NTA. Every time a man tells me to smile, I tell them to jump up and down. If they ask me why, I say that I thought we were ordering each other to do random things.", "NTA. I worked retail, and unless I was actually face to face interacting with a customer you wouldn\u2019t catch me smiling. Idk what people expect, for staff to walk around with a smile on their face their entire shift? If you were a creep for staring at him then wouldn\u2019t just walking away from a customer like that get you called rude? I mean you can\u2019t really win in that situation", "NTA your response was very much appropriate.", "NTA, and thanks for this great idea for dealing with dudes who tell you to smile.", "I would have just stared too. They deserve to feel awkward and uncomfortable. NTA. However, follow the instructions of your boss for the sake of your job.", "NTA I love this.  I haven't had this happen to me in a long time, but if it ever does again, I want to do like a crazy huge big weird smile and start laughing maniacally, or start crying and reply back \"But it IS that bad!\".  I can cry REALLY easily.", "NTA.\n\nI had a guy do that to me so I gave him my best Wednesday Adams impression.  He backed away slowly.  My other go-to is, \"Smile?  But my mom died.\"  I just leave out the fact that it happened years ago.", "NTA. \n\nHe made YOU feel uncomfortable. He deserves nothing less. \n\nFor future reference,  when someone tells me to smile I respond with: \"I'll smile when you're dead.\"\n\nBut for work situations turn that smile up to Clown Level on the creepy scale, maintain that eye contact, and maybe rub your hands eagerly together. Make their skin crawl. \n\nCreeps aren't customers. No business wants to risk the negative publicity of prioritising pervs over staff.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat guy was seventeen ways out of line and needs to mind his own business. If he got stared down for being rude, patronizing, and creepy, that\u2019s the least he deserves.", "NTA.  That is all.", "NTA and next time just don't tell your coworkers", "NTA, had an old dude tell me that while I was working at a tax prep place. Glad I was able to ask him if he smiled while doing his taxes 'cause he left in a rush.", "NTA", "NTA. As a customer service worker it is so hard to smile sometimes. Even if he had good intent, he overstepped. Especially since he\u2019s a man saying that", "NTA hero! I think this is a perfect response actually. I can also imagine slow blinking until he walked away or asked what was wrong with me. I think being as weird as they are in a nonaggressive way might actually make them think twice about doing it to the next girl.", "NTA, one of my biggest pet peeves is when men tell me to smile. It's always something said to women but not men, why is that?? I'm not a portrait here to look nice for you, fuck off", "Don\u2019t tell Bob anything except mandatory work stuff.\n\nMen who tell women to smile should!!! feel uncomfortable.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I would love to know why men do this? It\u2019s never women, only men who this to me\u2026.like all the time.", "NTA. Idk why men feel the need to tell women to smile. What u did wasn\u2019t creepy u just matched his energy. If it happens again and u decided to walk away, let out a huge fart as you go", "NTA. He should feel uncomfortable. He wouldn't have told another man to smile. Although I've had other women to tell me to smile before. It's absurd people think it's appropriate to police other's facial expressions.", "NTA Smile and do a wide eyed stare.", "Absolutely NTA. \"Creepy\"? Wtf?!", "\"hind site\"?", "NTA- good make him uncomfortable as a former cashier of almost eight years I\u2019d get that shit all the time like?! I\u2019m not a trained animal and smiling all the time would hurt my face so no I don\u2019t think so people think they\u2019re cute when they say that stuff and it\u2019s like no it\u2019s not I also used to hate the working hard or hardly working like?! Why do you think that\u2019s funny at all", "NTA", "NTA, why would you care about making random guy uncomfortable when he obviously didn\u2019t care about how uncomfortable his comment might make you?
