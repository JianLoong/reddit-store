I mean, it really is pretty common for toddlers to flush all sorts of different things down the toilet. That's probably just the first explanation that came to her mind. \n\nYou are being so overly dramatic and unnecessarily confrontational about this whole thing, and you've handled it very poorly.

Periods shouldn't have to come with the feeling of shame, secrecy and embarrassment. \n\nI think she should atleast compensate a little bit towards it, not every toilet they ever attend is going to work like hers, and some day this could have been a much worse and costly lesson to learn for them if she keeps doing it.", "Sending her the bill against your husband's wishes was a bad call... and petty.

If it's older, there can be grease deposits that snag the stuff in the pipe before they dissolve, and if you have lots of people using them, they can build up, as they dissolve best when submerged in water, and if it's laying in the pipe to the sewer, it will instead only be soaking in water caused by the fat/wipe damn until it makes its way to the municipal sewer. Cast iron pipes can also be problematic as those things too are old, and can be rough on the inside allowing the wipes to get stuck along the line. Again, what you can get away with is dependent on the brand of the wipes, and your sewage system. If you head over to /r/plumbing, you'll find the majority of pros suggest not using those things because of the potential problems they can cause.

She\u2019s 14, she\u2019s not a child, and it states on the wrapper for wet wipes and tampons that they\u2019re not to be flushed.\n\nAnyway, if Emma doesn\u2019t pay, start escorting her to and from the bathroom next time she visits, as she clearly can\u2019t be trusted. \n\nAlso inform Emma and Nina of how much damage they\u2019re doing to the environment by flushing those.

Once the makeup artist clogged the toilet with wipes that were labeled flushable. \n\nAs wiped don\u2019t biodegrade and clog plumbing, it\u2019s a much wiser choice to get a bidet attachment for your toilet.", "You should be scared. Nothing but bodily waste and septic safe toilet paper should be going through your toilets. It doesn't take much to cause a problem. My parent's septic pump failed over a year after I moved up. It was tangled up with my hair. We had little signs over the toilet paper in every bathroom for when guests visited. Not the best look but helped avoid some awkward conversations.", "I\u2019m also interested. I live in Australia and we were always told never to flush them and all my friends have always just wrapped them and disposed of in bins. Most of our public bathrooms have special disposal units in them too.", "The problem is that \"flushable\" and \"not fing up your plumbing\" are different. It is technically true that you can flush them, but they can mess your stuff up. The dissolvable ones we got recommended from our plumbers are not standard wet wipes.", "Please stop. They shouldn't be in the water system.", "A bidet is still way better for the environment.", "Well then I have no idea, maybe it's regional.", "I do not disagree. I bought us a bidet attachment. Then found our bathroom sink did not have threaded attachments. Also no cut offs. I had a plumber install cut offs, but like an amateur I did not specify and they used sweated fittings. Soooo still no way to hook it up.", "We got this one.

Outside of that your SIL and niece need to be told that flushing either of those things is generally harmful though.", "I do think it's a YTA move to send your family a bill.  She knew about it, she didn't offer to pay, let it go, and stop getting so offended that she asked if your 4 year old did it.  Some 4 year olds flush action figures down the drain, you should just be glad that yours doesn't.\n\nEmbarrassed to say that I did not know until now that you can't flush tampons.  I've always flushed them unless there's a sign over the toilet that says, \"this is a septic system, do not flush anything other than toilet paper.\"  I share this to point out that for a lot of people, that assumption is not absurdly idiotic, it's just a little oblivious.", "NTA.

It didn't occur to me that it would be an issue, because the fricking disposal instructions were \"flush 'em\". I have since been educated, and no longer flush them.", "Yep. Golf balls are flushable, too.", "That's what I thought, but I didn't want to say anything incorrect here on the internet. I was sure that in the nineties my tampon package directed me to flush them. And it's not like I often read the packaging after I learned to use them in case the directions changed. I know now not to do it, but I had to be told.

It's such a pain for wastewater treatment workers to have to deal with things that shouldn't be in the sewage system.", "Unfortunately there are ignorant people and assholes who know better but don't care everywhere.", "It's not generational, it common sense and respect for concern for the sewer system and the taxes that people pay to maintain those systems.\n\nI am shocked that there is a non 0 number of adults who flush tampons and pads.

My point is that 25 years+ ago this wasn\u2019t what was taught. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad that that has changed. In fact, it\u2019s a good thing for the very reasons you\u2019ve listed. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not always been that way. \n\nShocker. Here\u2019s another change. I was taught to cover my mouth with my hands when I sneezed.

It's your husband's sister, he didn't want you to do that, you did anyways. You could have sat down and figured out a way to make sure there was some responsibility taken without making your husband mad. The tension in your house is your own fault.
