They used the spare bathroom upstairs that no one else uses.\n\nWhen they left we had some septic problems with extreme clogging, we called SIL and she brushed it off and said my 4 year old must\u2019ve flushed something down it. My 4 y.o has never done that and is never unsupervised upstairs. \n\nWe called a plumber and they came out and told us it was clogged with tampons and wet wipes. \n\nI called my SIL and told her and she said it must\u2019ve been Nina, she must\u2019ve not known it wasn\u2019t like at home. I told her she should\u2019ve informed her daughter before hand. She made up this whole excuse about how she did, but they are able to at home so thought my toilet could handle it and it was a complete accident.\n\nI spoke to my husband about it and he didn\u2019t think we should make her pay for it, it seemed to be an accident. I though, disagreed and still did it. She clogged our toilet, and tried to make it seem like my son did it. \n\nI sent her the bill with a little message just stating the bill is due (blank) and I expect her to pay for it since it was their doings. \n\nWhen Emma received the bill, she called me angrily saying how she couldn\u2019t believe I was making her pay and it was an honest accident then hung up. She\u2019s sent my husband angry text about how I\u2019m \u201cchanging\u201d him, and she no longer will be coming back in the summer. \n\nThis has caused tension in my home and relationship. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH, she could definitely afford it. I understand Nina is a child, and it\u2019s not her fault, but Emma should\u2019ve educated Nina.

After all, she already tried blaming your 4yo for the problem before the plumber discovered the true cause of the blockage.", "NTA not flushing tampons and wet wipes is basic knowledge, as they dont disolve. Your sister shouldve taught Nina that.", "Nta your SIL plumbing hasn't failed YET.  It will eventually build up some where and cause an issue.  Even if it doesn't cause an issue for her the waste water treatment workers are cursing her out.", "NTA what pig flushes wipes and tampons down the bog!? \n\nThat's so disgusting, they clog pipes and cling to other shite people carelessly chuck down their bogs and sinks. It all has to get filtered back out and disposed of.\n\nShe started off by trying to blame a small child. Bad form indeed.", "NTA.  The first rule of menstruation club is that you do not flush pads or tampons in any circumstance. Period.", "NTA: So many companies are marketing wipes as flushable when they are definitely not\u2026 many women also flush tampons. I don\u2019t blame a 14 yr old for not knowing better. I do think it\u2019s an honest mistake. But if I was SIL, I\u2019d still offer to pay", "ESH. \n\nLook, your sister-in-law sounds like a real piece of work, and it was shitty of her to first blame your child and then try to avoid responsibility when it became clear that her daughter was to blame. The right thing for her to do would have been to apologize and offer to pay the bill.\n\nThe right thing for *you* to do was actually talk things out with your husband until you came to an agreement on how to handle the situation, not go behind his back and be so hostile and aggressive as to simply forward the bill along with a note that you expect it to be paid in full. You need to apologize both to Emma and to your husband, for needlessly creating problems in his relationship with his sister. Also wouldn't be a bad idea to apologize to Nina, as I imagine this young girl is absolutely mortified by this whole ordeal.", "Nta. It's common sense not to flush sanitary products and even then, you break something you fix it. \nYou guys were nice enough to open up your home so it's their problem to fix", "ESH\n\nEmma should offer to pay for at least part of the damages since it was her daughter who did it, end of the day. \n\nYou should accept that accidents happen and 14-year-olds can be awkward about wanting to hide periods and disposing of hygiene products.\n\nAlso, since she did talk to Nina, she really might have thought it was your 4-year-old and not been actively trying to decieve you. \n\nPersonally, I think each paying half would be fair.", "ESH:\n\nYou for doing this without your husbands knowledge, you talked about it but by no account do you say your still going through with it.\n\nSIL is teaching her daughter the wrong way to deal with these items, I'm a guy and know you don't flush pads, tampons and NON flushable wet wipes regardless of the system type.\n\nHusband should not be letting a thing like this slide.\n\nYour niece I'm giving a pass assuming she does not know better.", "ESH. I think the main AH is Emma, for refusing to fix what she (or her daughter) broke. It's incredibly tacky to run up a bill and make someone else pay it, claiming it was an accident (guess what? most car wrecks are accidents but the person who caused them still has to pay). But sending them the bill with a terse note, without your husband's knowledge, wasn't a good move. Are the damaged relationships worth it?", "YTA. You could have handled it better instead of starting a family fight. Many wipes state on the package that they are flushable although low flow toilets and pipes can't handle it.

Depending on where you live it is very common to flush tampons without a second thought. You and your husband should have very clear signs in the guest bathroom since clearly you aren\u2019t communicating this information with all of your houseguests. Sending Emma the bill without any notice or discussion about it makes YTA. \nIt may have been fair to ask to split the bill, but that ship has sailed.", "NTA. You don't accidentally flush unflushable products down a toilet, especially not enough of them to block the toilet. \nHer and her daughter owe you the money for their stupidity.", "YTA. \n\nDid YOU educate your niece about how to handle your toilet? It's your home, your toilet, etc. Did you talk to her about it? \n\nAnd yes, if there was a clog I would assume the preschooler shoved something down there. It would not occur to me that it was a tampon. I wouldn't even know to tell my girls not to flush a tampon because we have never had a toilet that couldn't flush wet wipes or tampons.", "I do think Emma should offer to help with the cost of the plumbing repairs, but you are completely overreacting and turning this situation into something else entirely. It was an honest accident and sometimes 14-year-olds simply don't know things that *you* might think are just common sense. \n\nAnd I seriously doubt Emma was being vindictive and trying to frame your son when she guessed he had been the one who clogged the toilet. I mean, it really is pretty common for toddlers to flush all sorts of different things down the toilet. That's probably just the first explanation that came to her mind. \n\nYou are being so overly dramatic and unnecessarily confrontational about this whole thing, and you've handled it very poorly. I'm sure this is pretty embarrassing for your niece and you have made her and your SIL feel unwelcome in your home by being so hostile about an innocent mistake. \n\nYTA.", "NTA I\u2019m a man and I know these things cannot be flushed. And of your husband insists on the sister not paying he should pay it himself", "NTA", "NTA based on the fact that things never seem to line up. \n\nFirst, you call with issues and instead of waiting to find out what it could be she automatically points blame on the 4 year old. Mind you, having kids myself that were once toilet destroyers the assumption that its possible isn't wrong, but wouldn't be my only opinion on why. \n\nSecond, *\"she said it must\u2019ve been Nina, she must\u2019ve not known it wasn\u2019t like at home.

Which one is it, did you inform her and she forgot out of habit or did you not inform her and she didn't know any better that It'd be different. Neither are really the fault of the child. \n\nBut, the deflection at every corner makes me feel shes just trying to cover her ass for not doing a little more informing during the visit. You can't tell me she didn't know the kid was on her period especially sharing a room, a quick \"remember aunties toilet isn't like ours\" would have gone a long way. Periods shouldn't have to come with the feeling of shame, secrecy and embarrassment. \n\nI think she should atleast compensate a little bit towards it, not every toilet they ever attend is going to work like hers, and some day this could have been a much worse and costly lesson to learn for them if she keeps doing it.", "Sending her the bill against your husband's wishes was a bad call... and petty. ESH", " You said: \"I spoke to my husband about it and he didn\u2019t think we should make her pay for it,\"  but you sent her the bill anyway and now your husband is angry with you???  Wow who could have seen that coming, LOL.  YTA", "ESH. Nina should know better than to wreck the toilet, but you should know better than to attack her for it against your husbands wishes.  Learn to deescalate and situation instead of making it worse.  For your husband the price of the plumbing is less important than having a smooth relationship with his sister/niece, for you it's more important to be right than to make your husband's life easier.", "NTA and they should NOT be doing that at home either.", "YTA.\nWhether or not they knew not to do so is irrelevant.\nYour husband said do not pursue this and you did. This makes you the AH and now the repercussions of your AH move are being felt across the family.\nIt's not ideal to have such expense, but when you have a home, ongoing maintenance and repairs are required.", "YTA  I don't make my guests pay for stuff like that.  It's just not done....also your husband didn't think it was a good idea.  \n\nIMO She's the AH for not offering to at least pay half...given that her daughter caused it but you can't make her pay.   No matter how angry you are you need to mend things.  Don't make your husband's family life miserable.", "ESH. \n\nI feel for poor Emma. How has her mom not educated her on how to properly dispose of tampons? I think you could\u2019ve handled it better and approached your SIL with a proposition to pay for half since it was an accident. Plumbers are expensive af and SIL should help out since it was her fault she failed to educate her daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
