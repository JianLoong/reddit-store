My two half brother's followed with the same explanation a couple of years later when they turned 18. I believe mom still talks to them about twice a year. But I have not seen or heard from them in more than a decade.

I told her I wasn't planning to invite them, that I didn't want to either. That after all these years we're strangers and I'd rather not send out invites for them to be ignored.

That\u2019s maybe harsh, but this sub gets the other side (older sibling to younger half siblings) allll the time and the advice is quite often that one cannot force affection where there is none and let things just be. The same in your case - they weren\u2019t mean, they didn\u2019t bully, they just didn\u2019t feel like you were their siblings, which is what they are entitled to feel. \n\nYou, in return, don\u2019t have to feel like they\u2019re your siblings either. In fact, you don\u2019t - maybe if they had been in your life more, they would\u2019ve but they don\u2019t. Again, you seem to carry no ill-will towards them and you seem to have no bad feelings. You and your full sister and them are just two groups of people, who are related, but not connected. And that\u2019s fine - it happens all the time with slightly more distant relatives. \n\nAnd your mom is not AH for thinking like she thinks either. She\u2019s a mother to all of you - it\u2019s most likely that it\u2019s hard for her not to have all her children get along like the big brady bunch family, but she should\u2019ve known better. \n\nI honestly think that your half-siblings on mom\u2019s side probably took it quite hard that their mother remarried so quickly, but this is on your mom, not on your siblings. Honestly speaking - i think with many kids, who have lost a parent and had their other parent remarried within a few years, it\u2019s very hard on them and adults downplay the emotions and feelings kids have in these situations with thoughts like \u201cthey\u2019ll get over it\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019ll get used to it quickly\u201d. Sometimes these are convenient lies parents like to tell themselves and others to hide the reality which is that kids, who have lost a parent, sometimes it takes them much longer to find their feet than their remaining parents do. You didn\u2019t mention what is your age gap with them and a large age gap can absolutely create a very distinct us vs them mentality amongst siblings with a large age gap even when it\u2019s full siblings.\n\nI think your attitude is point on when it comes to your relationship with them. You don\u2019t bear a grudge, but they\u2019re basically strangers. You don\u2019t have to invite strangers into your wedding as guests. They haven\u2019t invited you to theirs either, if they\u2019ve gotten married. \n\nIf you should ever reconcile with them, you\u2019ll take it in stride then. Until then, I think it\u2019s perfectly fine just simply not to care what they do and where they are.", "I get you don't care about your step siblings from mother's side.

Tell her again that you've made peace with it and are respecting their wishes. Tell her that if she loves all of you, she needs to respect everyone's wishes and stop pushing.", "NTA. They have declined multiple invitations over the years to birthdays, holidays, and graduations. They don't want to be a part of your lives. It's time your parents except it because you have.", "NTA \n\nThey aren't family to you and your birthday is about you, not your mom.", "Don\u2019t listen to your parents!!!!!! It\u2019s your party and only people you want should be there. Your parents have a PHD in guilting. You will be 21 and don\u2019t need to do what they say. NTA.\nI\u2019d feel great if you showed this comment to your parents.", "Because at her 21rst birthday, she should learn that it is better to extend the olive branch, then to break it.", "You don't want to be around you parents, but still have a relationship from afar with your sister by sending gifts. OPs siblings do not do that, and have made no effort in over 10 YEARS to even attempt to connect with her. Why should she 'be the bigger person'? It's clear they don't want a relationship by declining all invites so far. If they decide they want one, then they can reach out. But OP shouldn't have to continue getting hurt by their rejection.", "Or maybe she already knows it is better to cultivate meaningful relationships with the people who want her in their lives, and that there is no need to go chasing after those who have made it VERY clear they don't.", "It sounds like the invitations are family events.\n\nMy half sisters mom isn\u2019t my parent\n\nI agree she shouldn\u2019t have to but I wouldn\u2019t assume it\u2019s about her. The rejection. I don\u2019t think obligatory invite is the way to go anyways\n\nBut yes that\u2019s my hope that she will realize by me sending her gifts that I am not rejecting her.", "NAH. It's just a gesture at this point and I think everyone is aware of that. OP is tired of making it and is hurt by it being ignored. OP's mom still wants to make it on the off chance that one day it isn't ignored and that all the gestures cumulatively show that she (and the rest of her family)  never stopped trying.  \n\nIf OP can view it like throwing a penny into a fountain, a nice thing to do but ultimately meaningless, I'd say keep doing it because it pleases the family that is still in your life. But never plan for them to attend because they won't.", "NTA. It shouldnt be on you to leave the chance open, It's your birthday. Don't invite people you don't want there, easy. If your mom wants to leave the chance open she can do it on her birthday, forcing others to bear that is wrong", "\"One day they'll feel differently\" in which case, they can invite you to something and you can just throw it in the bin and not reply. Or go.\n\nFrom your description, you are an only child as far as your mum's side of the family is concerned. \n\nWhy waste the time, effort and emotional energy in inviting people you don't know and who won't come to your twenty-first? You can invite me if you like and I won't come either. It would mean just as much, or just as little.\n\nIn addition, if you keep inviting them to stuff they are not interested in, especially if your mum insists you do, it just makes you look a little desperate and needy when you are clearly far from either of these things.\n\nInvite your mates and your close family, bugger the buggers who want nothing to do with you and have the most fantastic birthday\n\nNTA. Not at all. By a long chalk", "NTA.\n\nWhere do people get this idea that a big family celebration is the time to rebuild thoroughly burnt bridges?", "You should just send you halfsibs a letter telling them that they need to speak to their mother and reiterate that it\u2019s on them they don\u2019t want a relationship. You can state your perspective of childhood if you want. To be honest you should just say you understand only the information that you were given. That you hope that they are happy and that this was the last invitation you would send on your mother behalf. That you recognize their boundaries but now you are setting your own. You\u2019re going to have a baby and don\u2019t need anymore negative influences in the future.", "People who say \u201cfamily is family\u201d never had a parent who is a raging narcissist that constantly tries to tear you down.  It was a personally rewarding day when I went NC with that parent and kept my spouse and child from being exposed to that toxic relationship.", "why though they have no beef with OP and OP has no beef with them. They just dont want to be part of OPs family which is their choice. Mom should find ways to be there for her older children not OP."]}
