Not as close as they are to each other which I understand. But my mom's kids have not been around in years. They were never mean and I don't remember any fighting. But when my half sister turned 18 (she's mom's oldest) she told my mom that she didn't want to be part of the family anymore and that she'd never been able to see us all as her family. My two half brother's followed with the same explanation a couple of years later when they turned 18. I believe mom still talks to them about twice a year. But I have not seen or heard from them in more than a decade. They were invited to graduations (mine and my full sister's), they were invited to other birthday parties, they were invited to my parents 20th wedding anniversary party, invited for family Christmas dinners and stuff. They never came.\n\nI accepted some years ago that they were simply not interested and I feel like it's okay. I have no bad memories of them.

I told her I wasn't planning to invite them, that I didn't want to either. That after all these years we're strangers and I'd rather not send out invites for them to be ignored. She told me I should do it for her. That maybe one day they will feel differently and we need to give them that chance.

Thats great.  But it doesnt mean that you have to send them an invite to every single event just because the opportunity is there.  If they want to be involved they can come to you and ask.

The siblings are strangers at this point and 21st birthday is a big event to welcome reconciliation at on the off chance they actually show up.

My other half siblings say they had no idea they felt so strongly about it but they do remember the discussions that happened after my mom's oldest said what she did. I don't remember having any bad experiences with them either. It seems like they had their feelings on the blended family and they decided to take themselves out of the dynamic.

So, when these \u201cgreat friends\u201d of yours again, go their own way, which inevitably happens.  Your family , your blood family, becomes more important.   My point of view, is to cherish all relationships\u2026.friends, family, strangers.  In this case, being inclusive of step siblings is more gracious then not.

And at a celebration, the more the merrier.", "I am not going to talk about their decisions but I am going to say this. I have a very young half sister and she is a very cute kid.  However I do not see myself having much of a relationship with her right now due to my issues with her parents. The last time I saw her, her mother lambasted me terribly. My Father was also very harsh on me as well.\n\nI decided to distance myself. Not because of my feelings for my sister but do to my feelings for her parents.\n\nI am not going to go and visit to be peoples punching bags.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think kind of drama is good for my sister.\n\nYour half siblings may not be rejecting you they may be rejecting your parents.  \n\nI send my sister gifts for her birthday and stuff and if she is older  I am open to having a relationship with her. \n\n\nYou don\u2019t know why they are all not showing up. But if all three of them are not. There is probably something to do with your parents. Perhaps they felt you and your other siblings were favored.

With the abusive family. And what \u2018names\u2019 exactly did I use?", "I think OP has done enough \u201ctaking the high road\u201dthroughout this relationship. This is not the first time this has happened, but is a part of a larger pattern of OP\u2019s half-siblings not treating or thinking of OP as part of their family. They made it abundantly clear that they did not want to be a part of OP\u2019s family when they left, and after years of the constant rejection that came with humoring OP\u2019s mom, it seems like it is a good time for OP to remove herself from the situation. \n\n\u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\u201d", "Are we sure there issue is with OP and not with their mom and stepdad and for the longest time seeing OP meant seeing their mom and step dad.\n\nI don\u2019t think a family party is the place to reach out though", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Mom needs to stop piggybacking on other events to make a reunion happen.", "Why in the world would you invite virtual strangers to a birthday party?", "That's mom's problem-- not OP's. If  mom is not having the party she has no say on the guest list.", "I\u2019d venture to guess that her \u201cdo it for me\u201d attitude about family unity may also have had something to do with it.", "I don\u2019t think we are sure of the cause or who they have an issue with, but when the half-sister and half-brothers left they said they did not want to be part of the family and did not see them as family.

She can do that for her birthday and her anniversaries.  You get to make the choice for them to be \"Family\" or not and you decided NOT.\n\nTell your mom and dad that they do NOT get input on the guest list--They are GUESTS not HOSTS.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH. \n\nHere\u2019s why: you say yourself that your half-siblings from mom\u2019s side didn\u2019t feel like you and your sister were their true siblings. That\u2019s maybe harsh, but this sub gets the other side (older sibling to younger half siblings) allll the time and the advice is quite often that one cannot force affection where there is none and let things just be. The same in your case - they weren\u2019t mean, they didn\u2019t bully, they just didn\u2019t feel like you were their siblings, which is what they are entitled to feel. \n\nYou, in return, don\u2019t have to feel like they\u2019re your siblings either. In fact, you don\u2019t - maybe if they had been in your life more, they would\u2019ve but they don\u2019t. Again, you seem to carry no ill-will towards them and you seem to have no bad feelings. You and your full sister and them are just two groups of people, who are related, but not connected. And that\u2019s fine - it happens all the time with slightly more distant relatives. \n\nAnd your mom is not AH for thinking like she thinks either. She\u2019s a mother to all of you - it\u2019s most likely that it\u2019s hard for her not to have all her children get along like the big brady bunch family, but she should\u2019ve known better. \n\nI honestly think that your half-siblings on mom\u2019s side probably took it quite hard that their mother remarried so quickly, but this is on your mom, not on your siblings. Honestly speaking - i think with many kids, who have lost a parent and had their other parent remarried within a few years, it\u2019s very hard on them and adults downplay the emotions and feelings kids have in these situations with thoughts like \u201cthey\u2019ll get over it\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019ll get used to it quickly\u201d. Sometimes these are convenient lies parents like to tell themselves and others to hide the reality which is that kids, who have lost a parent, sometimes it takes them much longer to find their feet than their remaining parents do. You didn\u2019t mention what is your age gap with them and a large age gap can absolutely create a very distinct us vs them mentality amongst siblings with a large age gap even when it\u2019s full siblings.\n\nI think your attitude is point on when it comes to your relationship with them. You don\u2019t bear a grudge, but they\u2019re basically strangers. You don\u2019t have to invite strangers into your wedding as guests. They haven\u2019t invited you to theirs either, if they\u2019ve gotten married. \n\nIf you should ever reconcile with them, you\u2019ll take it in stride then. Until then, I think it\u2019s perfectly fine just simply not to care what they do and where they are.", "I get you don't care about your step siblings from mother's side. But if you care for your mother you should invite them. It's highly likely they won't show up and you'll have given youe mother another chance \nWhy not?", "nta", "OP's friends have been a part of their life, their half-siblings have not, by each siblings own choice. It's better to hang onto the friends, the people who want to be a part of everything, who have been there when it counts. It doesn't sound like the half siblings will ever choose to be a part of or care about OP's life. Why should OP throw an olive branch out to people who have made it clear they don't want to grab on to it? Why sacrifice the friendships for people who have made it very clear they will never care?"]}
