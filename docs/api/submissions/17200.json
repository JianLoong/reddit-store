But I get how families work and if you have to accept this, then make your fianc\u00e9 handle it. He can clean prior, be there for her \u201cassessment\u201d (you go out to the movies) and he can handle the modifications she will require. After all, he says it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. She can asses the outside, no trash in weird spots kind of thing, but she doesn\u2019t get to come IN your home and tell you how to live. That\u2019s a total boundary stomper and I\u2019d be pissed.", "NTA. You pay rent for the space, not the home itself, so inside is not her concern. It\u2019s like when you park an RV/motorhome somewhere, if the yard is unkept or your place looked trashy, that would be a different story\u2026but the inside of YOUR home, is your business, not hers", "NTA... she's being nosey maybe ya should of moved elsewhere or build elsewhere\n\nThere wont be any privacy and your husband needs to set boundaries other wise u may need to rethink your living situation \nAll SIL needs is rent payments that's it", "NTA  Tell her she is welcome to assess the cleanliness of the property around the home but the inside of your home is not her property and therefore not hers to inspect.", "Wait\u2026isn\u2019t the tiny home yours and you are just renting the land/utilities?\n\nNTA if that\u2019s the case. She doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on and zero say what goes on in that house, so long as it doesn\u2019t spill into her yard.", "NTA. WTF? What are you, 5 year old?", "INFO: did you have an agreement in place about inspections etc?", "NTA. She's a landlord and must follow rules for renters. \n\nFind out what laws are implicated when you're renting land but own the home. Prolly more like renting space in a trailer park. I doubt she has the legal right to \"assess cleanliness\" so you may end up needing to move your tiny home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd look for a new patch of land to stay if you can, it'll probably develop into a bigger issue later on if she has issues with boundaries.", "Omg this made me cackle, a solo movie day actually sounds great \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4c", "This is a genius plan and honestly the question of AH. is moot if OP can just use this situation to their benefit.", "Yes and yes. Thank you. And absolutely not spilling into the yard. Like I said not like we have mold on dishes, we take our trash out and keep a decent space. I\u2019m just not gonna wipe the floor every time a shoe touches it. And we have two dogs, I\u2019m not gonna wipe their hair off things constantly.", "Good question and only for plumbing/electric stuff, the \u201ccleanliness inspection \u201c wasn\u2019t something previously added nor is it on the lease she insisted we sign to \u201chelp us with our credit\u201d which isn\u2019t bad bTw. I feel like because she has like three masters and a phd she looks down on or infantiles us. But yes the lease states what inspections are going to be expected.", "I agree and already told my fianc\u00e9 if she\u2019s coming in whatever she says he\u2019s responsible for. He nodded and agreed because he doesn\u2019t like it either but also doesn\u2019t want to make too much drama for his mama lol", "A tiny home, two adults and two dogs? Yikes!\n\nI think tiny homes are a great idea, but they have their limits...", "If it\u2019s not listed on the lease, NTA. But be prepared for her to add it. Sounds like a tenacious situation.", "hey sometimes family is weird and you just gotta roll with it.", "If that\u2019s the case I just won\u2019t sign it. I work with horses and live in a rural area. I got a job at a ranch in two weeks being here and my boss loves me, if need be we\u2019ll move the tiny home to his land, he already offered when I told him we have a tiny home. But his mom lives here and I love her and she has health issues which is ultimately why we decided to be here. But if push comes to shove I\u2019ll make a stink and let it be known I won\u2019t be walked over."]}
