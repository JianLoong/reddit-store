Irony: She had 4. Because she couldn't find any doctor willing to sterilize her and she was under so much social pressure from friends and family to get married and have kids. (Yay, hardcore old school Southern values and attitudes toward women/s)\n\nShe's in her 50's now. She constantly stressed about having been a \"bad mother\". Sometimes, she cries herself to sleep because she thinks she was a horrible human being and a horrible mother.\n\nNow, she is the most patient, kind and compassionate mom I have ever met in my life. Her kids adore her. She's got a magic touch with even the fussiest babies. She will do this thing where she will mimic roller skating through her house if one of her grandkids is colicky or fussing. I've seen her get an exclusively breastfed baby to take a bottle. (the mom was trying to wean her to the bottle due to having to take some heavy duty meds that would have harmed the baby) Mom and Dad couldn't get the little one to eat, but 10 minutes after her grandma took her, she was greedily sucking down the bottle. Everyone else's teeth were on edge and the tension was so thick it was uncomfortable to watch them. But, grandma was just as calm as could be. Later, after they went home, she just bawled with these great, heaving sobs, went and threw up, then went and got a triple shot of bourbon. I was so \\*CONFUSED\\*. Because I didn't understand the problem. Not until one of her cousins explained to me about her childhood. (Like, her own maternal grandmother berated her mom for NOT smothering her in her crib because her paternal grandma didn't believe she was her dad's get.

Let's just say I was properly horrified by how she was the very definition of a scapegoat, for the entirety of BOTH families.)\n\nIt's kind of like the best leaders are the ones who NEVER, EVER wanted to be in a position of authority or be responsible for anyone else but themselves due to an irrational fear of mucking it all up beyond recognition.\n\nYou didn't want kids.

Do you know how exceedingly RARE that is?\n\nThe fact that you derived no pleasure or satisfaction from either role, but you dedicated yourself to being the best at it you could, well, that is both commendable and heartbreaking at the same time.\n\nHow many nights did you go hide and feel like crying or getting blind stinking drunk to just feel ok? I am not saying you did, but how many times over the years did you FEEL like it?\n\nAnd I am left wondering who hurt you so much that you became so adverse to the idea of marriage and/or kids.\n\nI would encourage you to go talk to someone.
