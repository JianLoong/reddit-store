I bought her a purse from one of her favorite brands and she was pleased when she opened it at the party (family tradition to open the presents toward the end of the party so the giver could see how happy they made the birthday person). \n\nA couple days ago I ran into Judy at the supermarket. Judy asked me if I still have the receipt of the purse. I said no. She then asked me if I could find the time to go with her to the mall. I asked what was going on and she said the birthday gift from her cousin from the other side who lived in another city just arrived and it was exactly the same purse I bought her. She thought she could exchange my purse for something else since she doesn\u2019t need two of the same thing. So she either needs the receipt or my credit card to return the purse.\n\nI admitted that I was a little upset. I wasn\u2019t particularly close to Judy because her parents moved around a lot until a few years ago, but I put time and effort into getting her this purse. I told Judy that I\u2019m busy and don\u2019t plan on going to the mall anytime soon. I then walked away. Judy followed me and asked why was I being petty and mean when she was just being practical, but I paid for my things and left the supermarket.

Double the joy!", "NTA. I don't get all the YTA. Like yeah, gifts are supposed to be convenient to the person receiving them and getting two of the same thing does seem like a burden, but what about OP's situation? OP specifically spent her time and effort picking out a gift for her cousin, and her cousin just walks up and says that her gift was literally useless to her.\n\nI will say that the cousin's approach on this matter is pretty harsh and sudden. Like, you can't just jump on somebody's effort like that and say, \"Hey, it's more convenient for me to get rid of your gift and disregard your sentiments than the person who gave them to me the latest.\"\n\nNo, she should've apologized and softly let her reasons be known, but no, all she cares about is having two different bags of the same brand. If I had a cousin who disregarded my feelings like that, I would probably react the same way as OP.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a little weird that she wants to return the one you got her and not the new one. Presumably, if she likes it she has already removed the tags and even used it. Seems a little sue in that maybe she didn\u2019t even get that same purse at all.", "NTA you gave it to her. If people don\u2019t include the gift receipt with the gift then the ability to return or exchange isn\u2019t a part of it/isn\u2019t a gifted gesture.

She can sell it on Poshmark or eBay.", "\nEdit: to put NTA first. \n\nHow the fuck are people saying YTA. You\u2019re NTA. Why are you expected to go to a fucking mall? So now she had two purses. Oh well. Sell one. How is it your problem?", "NTA\n\nIt was rude of her for trying to return/exchange a gift, and ask you to do it. She could have regifted the second purse, that would have been more gracious and justified. Imo it\u2019s tacky to ask someone who has gotten you a gift to do so, unless they\u2019ve offered it beforehand. If you\u2019re not even close and she did this, that\u2019s worse.\n\nI would have never done what your cousin did, but that\u2019s a personal choice.", "NTA. Have her sell the gift at eBay. Why do people think they are entitled to cash behind their gifts? So she got two of the same thing. Big deal. Stop optimizing for the gifts other people put time and money into. I think this is just an American thing.\n\nEdit: And so entitled to expect you to chaperone her so she can get the cash.", "NTA and I don\u2019t get all the YTAs.  Timing is important. She opened your gift, thanks you for it and days later when she gets a duplicate of your gift, she is being rude to you because she can\u2019t be arsed to put a bit of effort and ask the person who sent the duplicate gift for a receipt. \n\nAll the people who are complaining how tacky it is and that\u2019s why you have gift receipts\u2026 well that applies to the person who sends a personal gift via mail. Never mind it also came LATE.", "YTA, she did like the purse very much, she just got 2 of them. Exchanging one of them is more than reasonable. Now, where I'm from you usually give the receipt to the person in an envelope with the gift so you don't have to be a part of situations like this.....", "Going against the grain here and saying NTA.\n\nJudy has the option of regifting one of those purses...or, if she really does like that particular purse, saving one so when inevitably the first begins to show wear and tear, they can be swapped out.", "Um...what advantage is the OP going to return the purse? She doesn't have the original or a guest receipt. Some stores will return on your credit card, but many won't. And why can't the giftee take it to the store herself for store credit and then pick something else out. Or regift it. \n\nAsking the gifter to come with you to exchange a gift is ridiculous. EHS.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NAH. It seems like the second purse, the one you didn't get, arrived after yours so she should be asking the other person for an exchange first not you. It's very possible your cousin did already ask the other person, but if she did that was not made apparent to you. Although, she isn't wrong for asking you first either.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t wanna help her return it, give a gift receipt. That\u2019s why those exist.", "Yeah, YTA. You're 19, and I guess you don't really understand the world yet, so don't take it personally, but there really is no point in insisting someone keep a gift they don't need. If someone wants to return / exchange a present for ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, then fine. I don't think you need to take a day out of your time to help, but you should absolutely have given a gift receipt. I hope they like the thing they decide on. It's not an insult to you. It's being practical.", "Yta.  She's  being practical.  You live closer.\n\nAlways ask for a gift receipt when buying a gift.", "NAH...She asked, you said no.  She'll have to figure something else out.", "If you would've intended for your cousin to be able to return the gift, you would have provided a gift receipt. You did not intend your gift to be returned.\n\nHowever, you also didn't know you and someone else got her the same gift. It makes sense your cousin wants to return one.\n\nAll that said, the fact that you were only told about the duplicate gift when it was an opportunity of convenience kind of rubs me the wrong way. Idk how much time has passed since the party but I'm not fully sold that she even got a duplicate gift. She didn't reach out to you through some other means other than by circumstance. It was very spur of the moment for her to spring that on you and tell you to go to the mall with her for a refund. Also, in my experience it is just as common, or even moreso to get a gift receipt with a gift that was sent via mail because the person who sent it ISN'T in the same area to return it. Why can't that one be returned?\n\nI'm probably being overly cynical here, but the whole abruptness of needing to return the purse at a moment like that just feels so forced and not natural. I'm sure there could be a reasonable explanation for it all, but I just wasn't getting that vibe here. I expect downvotes since Y T A has control of this thread now.\n\nIf there's a reasonable explanation then I think Y T A, but with my reasoning I think NTA. Maybe get some proof so you can actually find out if your cousin is in need of an assist here, then help her out.", "YTA what's wrong with you?", "why don\u2019t she just sell it or take it to said store and exchange it?", "NTA. There's no reason why she couldn't have asked the person who sent the other gift", "YTA\n\nRegardless of if she likes it or not - it's immaterial why she wants to take it back. Maybe she was saving face in front of everyone? Maybe she _does_ have two? Who knows, who cares?\n\nYou can have put a ton of thought into it or just 5 seconds, the point is this is why you provide a receipt with things you give as gifts - to save all this fuss.\n\nThis is awkward for her as well as you - fact is she'd like to return it and there's nothing wrong with you helping her facilitate that.\n\nYour choice has done nothing but damage the relationship between you and if anything guarantees she'll just sell it or find another way to achieve the same end: getting something she _does_ want.\n\nYou could've taken the positive road here and helped her or offered to replace it with a different one - whatever she liked - instead it seems you've chosen to be rather petty all because of \"you\" reasons and not because you're genuinely thoughtful and care.\n\nFolks get gifts they don't want - it happens to all of us and ultimately what matters here is you getting her something she _does_ want and she'd treasure that thought and effort you'd go to - instead, this is what she'll think of you.", "NTA, it's not your responsibility to fix her duplicate gift problem. Maybe she'll learn to communicate better next time.", "Would it make you feel better if she returned the other bag but just got you to help her do it?

And everything about your subsequent interaction w/ her is petty AF.", "YTA. Why would you want her to have two identical purses?", "Where I live you are NTA as it is considered rude to to return or exchange a gift even when a gift has been doubled, it is even ruder to ask the gift giver for a receipt, it just isn\u2019t done here.

She liked the gift, but she got a duplicate, and the other gift giver loves elsewhere and so your purse is the only one she could exchange.", "ESH. It's not a personal slight to want to return a gift. The story about it being a duplicate could be true and it could be a white lie, it doesn't matter. It's disappointing when you put effort into a gift and the person doesn't keep it, but it happens. However, she doesn't need you with her to return the purse, the receipt is enough.

She thought she could exchange my purse for something else since she doesn\u2019t need two of the same thing. So she either needs the receipt or my credit card to return the purse.\n\nI admitted that I was a little upset. I wasn\u2019t particularly close to Judy because her parents moved around a lot until a few years ago, but I put time and effort into getting her this purse. I told Judy that I\u2019m busy and don\u2019t plan on going to the mall anytime soon. I then walked away. Judy followed me and asked why was I being petty and mean when she was just being practical, but I paid for my things and left the supermarket.

It\u2019s pretty unreasonable to be angry that someone bought her the same gift you did.

Also, you ran into her unexpectedly, it was on her mind, so she brought it up - it\u2019s not like she\u2019s been blowing up your phone. Yes, it\u2019s inconvenient for you, but it seems to me that she\u2019s asking if there\u2019s a way you can help her with this that would minimize the inconvenience.

Gift giving is about getting something the other person wants or needs out of kindness, not expecting anything in return. She does not need two purses and it doesn\u2019t matter that she received/opened your gift first.

Happy birthday baby girl!!\u201d", "Soft YTA. I can see why you're upset, but a gift is not an obligation. \n\nBest care scenario she has two and doesn't need one so you'd have got to see her joy picking out a new present and could have made a day of it. Worse case scenario she didn't really like it was being nice about why she wanted to return it, and doing so means you still technically got her a gift rather than the bag just being donated or sold online for probably significantly less than it was worth.", "YTA she doesn\u2019t need 2 of the same thing. Yours would be easier to exchange.", "Why are you upset she wants to return a purse she now has two of? She loves your gift but in no world needs two of the exact same purse. YTA.", "YTA. You are so petty. She will probably end up selling your purse anyway, of course she doesn't need two of them.", "NTA, I\u2019m surprised by all the Y T A here.

I think it\u2019s entitled to expect you to escort her to the mall. \n\nShe can likely return it for store credit, or sell it if it\u2019s that big of a deal. And while placing a gift receipt with an item can be a courtesy, I think it is more acceptable to graciously accept gifts and if you don\u2019t like them, thank the giver and figure it out yourself. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m out of touch, but I don\u2019t when it started to be accepted that the receiver of the gift is not only entitled to the cash the gift cost, but even more of the givers time than choosing the gift and attending the party.", "She shouldn\u2019t need a receipt to do an exchange at the same store.", "NTA, you put time and effort into choosing her gift. If she doesn't want it is not your problem.", "I doubt she got another purse, exactly the same. She wanted the money.", "This is why you include receipts with expensive gifts. I'd help her out it just seems unfortunate, not like a personal attack or anything to be offended by.", "You don\u2019t get to decide what she does with her gift.

She happened to get another one from someone else who can't go with her to exchange for something else. She could have sold one and upset you or the other cousin. But she instead asked you if she could exchange the one you got so she still had a gift from you. It doesn't cost you anything extra. You could even get a day at the mall with your cousin out of it. I cannot figure out what your problem is with this. This is literally why gift receipts exist.", "YTA for giving a gift because it makes *you* feel good instead of doing so with the goal of making the recipient feel good.", "Why is everyone so focused on her being hurt that the cousin wanted to return the gift? I feel like that\u2019s sort of a minor contributor to why op doesn\u2019t want to return the gift and it\u2019s mostly a logistics issue not a malicious butthurt move over her gift not being \u2018chosen\u2019/appreciated/however you wanna phrase it -I know when I go to the mall that getting there,parking,and going in to find the place I need to shop isn\u2019t a laborious process but also isn\u2019t a quick drive by outing (like,it\u2019s taking me an hour+ ) cousin could probably sell it on eBay or ask the other gifter if they have the receipt and could mail it/email it and those would take equal effort", "YTA. Why should you be upset because someone wants to exchange the present?????? \n\nSo what if you put time & effort into it. Reverse the rolls- what if you got a present that you didn't want (regardless of if you got a duplicate). Should you just keep it to keep the giver happy?", "NAH / very very lite ESH. \n\nYou\u2019re both teenagers, so this may be the first time the two of you are dealing firsthand with gifting etiquette, including returning presents. The stakes are a little higher when it\u2019s your own money you\u2019re spending, that you likely hard worked for. Your feelings of disappointment are totally valid, as are her feelings that you are being petty for refusing to help. \n\nGo with her to return it. Then help her pick out something new! Turn it into quality time - what better way than to help her pick out a new present that you both KNOW she\u2019ll love? She\u2019ll have a fond memory of you every time she uses that new thing, esp if it\u2019s a replacement bag. It\u2019s a win-win for you. \n\nWhen you gift something to someone, even if you think it\u2019s a slam dunk, there\u2019s a chance it has to be returned. Maybe they got duplicates (or multiple duplicates!) or maybe their tastes have changed. Don\u2019t take it personally if someone returns your gift - it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t appreciate it or you, more often than not. I\u2019d much rather someone have something useful or lovely to them than something that makes them feel guilty or obligated. A gift is a symbol or physical manifestation of your feelings for the person - not a reflection of you, or their feelings for you, if that makes sense. You have no control over what the recipient does with it after it leaves your hands. Including a gift receipt every times prevents them from having a conversation like this that can lead to awkwardness and uncomfortable feelings. \n\nTake this as a learning experience, and I hope someday you and your cousin can laugh about this together \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA\n\nIt's rude. Actually telling people how much something you gifted them cost  (here have the receipt) is also rude\n\nI have gotten presents I didn't like. They're just stuff. The intention mattered cause that person thought of me\n\nI simply sell or regift them, I couldn't ever imagine going to someone who gave me something and saying that for this or that reason I don't need it. \n\nI got something for free. No one owed me a gift, not even for my birthday\n\nYeesh...", "YTA\n\nThis isn't a case of her trying to return a gift she didn't like or want - it's a matter of her getting duplicate gifts and it sounds like it's a lot easier for you to help return the one you bought than the other cousin who lives in another city.", "YTA. She loved your gift but she has two now. You\u2019re closer and more convenient to do the exchange.  Just do it and you can help her pick another one.

What would you do?", "In this situation, I have to vote YTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d came to you about swapping the gift you gave her because it would be a lot harder to do through the phone & messages, and that coming to you was the best option because you are her close friend and would understand.

I actually don\u2019t understand why you got so offended?", "NAH-No assholes here. She\u2019s not in the wrong for not wanting two of the same purse, and you aren\u2019t wrong for being a little upset.

Keep the gift, regift it, or donate it. But don't make your cousin suffer for your mistake.", "YTA", "YTA. This is about your ego and not the person you gifted. When we give gifts, we give up the right to determine what happens to that gift later. She got two, needs to return one, and it\u2019s easier to do the one at the physical store. This is why when giving a gift we make sure we provide things like a receipt. Otherwise we are giving a burden which negates the point of a gift. Sure she could get a receipt from the other cousin, attempt to return it via mail- even taking it to most stores these days still means the return is processed remotely and incurs extra costs-, and eventually get it settled. However, yours was the obvious one to rerun. She\u2019s not an AH for asking. Nothing about her behavior indicates she was. She asked for reasonable help and you decided your feelings about her gift were more important than hers. It\u2019s being petty.", "Grow up? Why are you butthurt she wants to return the purse? She appreciates the gift she just wants to swap it for something she appreciates more, no need to cry about it you freak", "Yta. Getting someone a gift isn\u2019t to make YOU happy. It\u2019s to make them happy. If she wants to exchange it, and it makes her happy, let her.", "NTA- she could reach out to her cousin and exchange it. You took the time and spent money to get her what she wanted but next time don\u2019t get her anything.", "NTA why doesn't she send the other purse back? Oh wait, it's because the story is made up and she just wants the cash? Yeah, she's so lucky she didn't get a handmade sweater.", "NTA! A gift is not a requirement and it's not your fault she got two of the same--especially since yours was gifted first. If she already thinks you're being petty you may as well take it back, get a refund, and remind her a gift is a nice choice/gesture and not something she's owed. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso... why is everyone acting like someone having duplicates of something is bad? If one purse gets beat up, lost, etc she'll have a replacement ready to go! Or she can sell it and get some cash. Geez...", "Risk being in minority but NTA. \n\nGifts are not an obligation. If you gift me something, I'm grateful that you did. But it's not your moral obligation to 'fix' the gift until I am satisfied with it. It is my problem to find a way to use or discard what I've been gifted.\n\nI know you said you invested time and effort into buying this particular purse, but had you even regifted it to her, it should not matter as long as she liked it. A bit presumptuous of her to expect you to have bought the gift (and not have regifted) and then to have receipts (and not have bought it through credit card rewards or similar ways that do not allow returns).\n\nAn added perspective: What if this was a handmade object, like a painting or pottery, and what if she received two paintings or two pieces of pottery. Would she still want to return one?", "NTA. Why can\u2019t the other cousin send her a copy of the receipt from the duplicate bag? She sent the present late. And why didn\u2019t she send a gift receipt along with the bag? She\u2019s sending a present out of state and just assuming that the person is going to use it or like it. It\u2019s not your fault that she happened to get her the same purse you did. And that\u2019s if she even got a duplicate. \nSounds more like she just didn\u2019t like the purse is trying to go about exchanging/returning it in a roundabout way instead of just telling you that she doesn\u2019t like it or it\u2019s not her style. Or she never even got a duplicate and just doesn\u2019t like your present.", "Petty and mean? WOW! Let her ask her cousin to exchange it. You gave her the present first, and she liked it until she got another one. She's not a friend or someone you should have in your life. Biggest NTA", "NTA people who say that you are T A are rude, penny pinching people who clearly don't understand the value of a gift. It comes from the heart and the fact that it isn\u2019t \u201cpractical\u201d for her to have two of the same purses is frankly not your problem.", "NTA - regardless of \u201cmanners\u201d she could\u2019ve said something before you left the party about how she truly felt or if she really got two then suck it up buttercup, sell one of them, idfk, she has lots of choices tho so.", "NTA. It was ungracious of her to put you in that situation.", "NTA. I would say NAH, but she should've dropped it after you said you didn't have the receipt. You gave her a free item. Sure, you didn't give her the receipt, but not giving someone a receipt for a free item doesn't mean you've volunteered your time to refund it.\n\nShe can do whatever else she wants to with it. I'd actually say even approaching you about returning a gift you gave her was pretty rude of her unless you guys are very close.", "A lot of stores these days have a two week return policy. I imagine that this will very likely be the case with this purse. Not to mention, it\u2019s probably not even the purse you gave her, since I imagine she already started using that one. NTA", "Against the grain here, but I'm going **ESH**.\n\nJudy received and liked your present when she got it. Some amount of time later, she got the same present from someone else. Sure, she doesn't need 2 of the same, but the *second gift* is the problem, not the one from OP. Yes, yes, the other gifter is in a different city, but that is not OP's problem. If anyone here should \"bite the bullet,\" it's Judy. She can either keep 2 of the same, or re-gift the second to someone else, or reach out to the other cousin to email her a copy of the receipt, or figure out another solution. Many stores actually accept returns even without a receipt, as long as the tags are still there, though they'll only do it for an in-store gift card. Either way, I don't approve of Judy asking OP to help return the item because someone else got her the same thing *after* OP.\n\nOP is still a bit of an AH, though. It doesn't look like a long time has passed, so not sure why OP didn't hang on to the receipt for a bit. More importantly, this is a lesson for OP: going forward, *always* include a gift receipt when you give someone a present. Your gift could be the wrong size, or the wrong colour, or simply not liked, or might be faulty in some way that needs to be replaced. The person being gifted should always be given the option of going in to return/exchange the item themselves without making things awkward by having to reach out to you.", "Just tell her to return her cousin's gift. Problem solved.", "I'm going against the grain here, but NTA. Sure, if she really received two identical gifts, I get why and how she wanted it exchanged. But when you said you no longer had the receipt, why not contact the other cousin with the same question?\n\nSomething's off.", "NTA. A gift can be exchanged for something of the same value or higher without a receipt. It sounds more like she wants the money from it, so I wouldn't agree either.", "NTA.\n\nYou told her that you don\u2019t have to receipt & that you weren\u2019t goin to the mall anytime soon. It\u2019s not your fault that she got the same gift twice.", "Ehhhhh, I would say NTA. I would be kinda upset too if she chose to return your gift instead of the later gift, and if it was bought online and they can easily email the receipt. She could be more considerate of your feelings if this was upsetting to you, instead of berating you by calling you petty and mean immediately after you told her you were busy. Even if she is the recipient of the gift, I think respect goes both ways. In the future, it'll be best to include a gift return receipt and let them settle returns on their own. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nAlthooooough, if it's a lot more trouble to return the later gift, probably best to just go to the mall with Judy and exchange for a different bag. She's going to pay the difference of course if the new bag is more expensive. And you could ask her why she chose to return yours instead of the other cousin, and if she attempted to reach out to them first instead of approaching you. It might put your heart more at ease and let this go. Incidents like this have a way of being brought up again, the next time there's a family gathering. Might be best to be the better person this round.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t very polite of her and, being upset, you walked away. That\u2019s reasonable.", "I think the way you handled the situation could have gone differently. \n\u201c hey Judy, wow I can\u2019t believe someone else got you the exact same purse. I do not have the receipt, do you know if your cousin has the receipt to return her gift?\u201d \n\u201cNo I do not have the receipt; I\u2019ll see what I can do but I\u2019m unavailable the next few weeks. Let try next month.\u201d", "Always get a gift receipt. If she liked the gift so much she would be fine if you ate the receipt. I mean if she didn't liked the gift she wouldn't have any qualms if you ate the gift receipt. Just make sure she didn't take a sloppy mudpie before you eat. \n\nNow I get that someone bought her the same bag but as someone once said if always good to have doubles cause that way you know you have a pristine one and if it gets scratched you don't care. Or she could get triples of the bag because triples are better than doubles. Right?", "Idk the other gift is probably from Amazon and those are easy to return. More details needed but honestly I would never ask someone I don't know well or am close to to return a gift.", "NTA-\n\nThe whole thing is just so over the top! You did an amazing thing by getting a thoughtful gift.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten duplicate gifts before and it\u2019s really just whatever. I don\u2019t have expectations as an adult to be given anything even on my birthday.\n\nIf it\u2019s not exchanging for another size I\u2019m not even going there.\n\nIt just seems entitled in general to even initiate wanting to return the gift in general but then to get mad at OP? \n\nEntitled. No one owes the birthday girl more than the gift they got.", "Ok, so exchange cards aren't a universal thing, huh? In my country, every time you buy something, they ask if it's for a gift and if you want an exchange card, a special receipt that doesn't have the price but allows you to return the item and get something else from the store. I always get exchange cards and pick stores with lots of options. Problem solved.", "YTA and this is what gift receipts are for.", "Yes, I agree. If I buy an actual present vs. gift card or cash, I include a gift receipt. \n\nIt's a gift.

She's being ridiculous", "It\u2019s not a second bottle of the same wine.", "You do know that there\u2019s a time frame to return items, right? She probably doesn\u2019t have the receipt anymore to exchange the purse.", "But the got the 2nd one AFTER OP gave her the gift. Seems kinda shitty, like just tell your cousin that you just got given the same one, return it and make a shopping day out of it with the cousin. IDK, NTA OP, you don't have to take MORE time to find ANOTHER nice gift for her bc she decided yours wasn't as good as the other when she got it first. Just seems kinda rude to be like YEAH I loved your gift but someone gave me the same one after you did, so YOURS is getting returned and you HAVE to take MORE time from your OWN life to come with me to return it. Lol I'd walk off too.", "YTA yourself", "I disagree, The way the cousin acted was tacky at best. Here are the reasons:\n\nOP is not obligated to give a gift, (What is weird though is that there was no gift receipt, designer brands normally would print a gift receipt when the purchase is a gift.) but she was gracious enough to do so, even she researched what this person likes so se also put time into finding the perfect gift, so it's totally logical the way the cousin approached this would hurt op's feelings, because it says: \"I don't give a rat's behind about the effort you put into giving me a gift\".\n\nIf I was the cousin I would have gone to the store with both bags (gift wrap and all) and I would have explained the situation in order to exchange the bag. (I used to work at Kate spade, and we would have exchanged the bag no problem, I know manny similar brands have the same policies).\n\nI don't understand why you think the cousin has a free pass to hurt OP's feelings but OP cannot act in consequence.\n\nEven in the worst case scenario, that was really the time, place or way to approach op with such sensitive conversation?\n\nOP NTA\n\nEdit: I'm going to share a lil story of mine.\n\nI have this friend I cherish a lot, He is wealthy, so everytime his birthday comes I shiver in panic because he has everything so whatever I gift to him on my limited budget I work it to make it unique and special, either by personalizing, or making something myself.\n\nSo then my birthday came, he is a busy guy so he went to an store and made the clerk to pick something for me, (I assume) the gift came with a gift receipt, I took the gift out and surprise it wasn't my size. My friend was very disappointed, so what did I do? went to the store and exchanged it for an smaller size.", "Assuming that she has 'two' and not just letting OP down gently.", "The gift was a purse, not a voucher for OP's time. If she doesn't want it, she can sell it, give it away to someone else, throw it in the bin or launch it into space. Whatever she wants as it's hers now. What she shouldn't do is hassle the gift giver.", "I could see if the way Judy approached this came off as callous or ungrateful, like I do think something like this requires a bit of tact and maybe she didn\u2019t have that. But situationally I still agree YTA, you should absolutely not take it personally", "And as they're identical, they could literally return the duplicate, not the one OP bought. The shop would never know.", "This exactly. \u2b06\ufe0f OP seems to be making this all about her.", "I'd be horrified to ask someone to give me a receipt because I was getting rid of the gift they gave me. It discounts the gift as having any meaning entirely, and sees it entirely as a monetary transaction.\n\nI've gotten a double gifts before, and I donated it to someone who would need it, charity or a nonprofit thrift store if not. I don't want to insult either gift giver by friggin returning it, let alone telling them I'm doing so. \n\nPeople do this? And it's common enough that there's a tidal wave of Y.T.A?\n\nMust be a cultural thing. Which is fine. Different strokes for different folks. I'm just blown away by how many folks said YTA to OP rather than the gift returner being the AH.\n\nAnd I'm just not understanding, at all.

The gift itself is just a stupid material artifact. The true gift is the gratification that another person cares about you.

The other thing is, I ALWAYS still send a hand-written thank you note, heck after our wedding a decade ago my husband and I each wrote personalized thank yous to the 300+ gift givers; I spent the first few months after my daughter was born writing thank yous AND texting people pics of her using the gifts, and even students in schools I\u2019ve worked in I still keep a deck of thank you cards with me and write their family a note. For our daughter we don\u2019t have her open gifts at the parties and I\u2019ve noticed most of her friends\u2019 families also follow that. I\u2019m kind of surprised you got her a purse and also really loved the fanfare of the whole group gift opening experience, given your young age.
