I bought her a purse from one of her favorite brands and she was pleased when she opened it at the party (family tradition to open the presents toward the end of the party so the giver could see how happy they made the birthday person). \n\nA couple days ago I ran into Judy at the supermarket. Judy asked me if I still have the receipt of the purse. I said no. She then asked me if I could find the time to go with her to the mall. I asked what was going on and she said the birthday gift from her cousin from the other side who lived in another city just arrived and it was exactly the same purse I bought her. She thought she could exchange my purse for something else since she doesn\u2019t need two of the same thing. So she either needs the receipt or my credit card to return the purse.\n\nI admitted that I was a little upset. I wasn\u2019t particularly close to Judy because her parents moved around a lot until a few years ago, but I put time and effort into getting her this purse. I told Judy that I\u2019m busy and don\u2019t plan on going to the mall anytime soon. I then walked away. Judy followed me and asked why was I being petty and mean when she was just being practical, but I paid for my things and left the supermarket.

YTA", "YTA for your reasoning. It\u2019s not a dig to you that she wants to exchange it, she doesn\u2019t need two of the same thing. Clearly it was a well chosen gift if two of her loved ones thought it suited her.\n\nIdk why you\u2019re making this personal", "I would suggest always giving a gift receipt going forward.

If anything, she should send the second one she just received back.", "NTA!", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to return a gift for someone else. Plus, who doesn't love getting the same gift twice? Double the joy!", "NTA. I don't get all the YTA. Like yeah, gifts are supposed to be convenient to the person receiving them and getting two of the same thing does seem like a burden, but what about OP's situation? OP specifically spent her time and effort picking out a gift for her cousin, and her cousin just walks up and says that her gift was literally useless to her.\n\nI will say that the cousin's approach on this matter is pretty harsh and sudden. Like, you can't just jump on somebody's effort like that and say, \"Hey, it's more convenient for me to get rid of your gift and disregard your sentiments than the person who gave them to me the latest.\"\n\nNo, she should've apologized and softly let her reasons be known, but no, all she cares about is having two different bags of the same brand. If I had a cousin who disregarded my feelings like that, I would probably react the same way as OP.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a little weird that she wants to return the one you got her and not the new one. Presumably, if she likes it she has already removed the tags and even used it. Seems a little sue in that maybe she didn\u2019t even get that same purse at all.", "NTA you gave it to her. If people don\u2019t include the gift receipt with the gift then the ability to return or exchange isn\u2019t a part of it/isn\u2019t a gifted gesture.  You aren\u2019t that close so if I were her I would have not asked. It\u2019s her property now.  She can sell it on Poshmark or eBay.", "How the fuck are people saying YTA. You\u2019re NTA. Why are you expected to go to a fucking mall? So now she had two purses. Oh well. Sell one. How is it your problem?", "NTA\n\nIt was rude of her for trying to return/exchange a gift, and ask you to do it. She could have regifted the second purse, that would have been more gracious and justified. Imo it\u2019s tacky to ask someone who has gotten you a gift to do so, unless they\u2019ve offered it beforehand. If you\u2019re not even close and she did this, that\u2019s worse.\n\nI would have never done what your cousin did, but that\u2019s a personal choice.", "NTA. Have her sell the gift at eBay. Why do people think they are entitled to cash behind their gifts? So she got two of the same thing. Big deal. Stop optimizing for the gifts other people put time and money into. I think this is just an American thing.\n\nEdit: And so entitled to expect you to chaperone her so she can get the cash.", "NTA and I don\u2019t get all the YTAs.  Timing is important. She opened your gift, thanks you for it and days later when she gets a duplicate of your gift, she is being rude to you because she can\u2019t be arsed to put a bit of effort and ask the person who sent the duplicate gift for a receipt. \n\nAll the people who are complaining how tacky it is and that\u2019s why you have gift receipts\u2026 well that applies to the person who sends a personal gift via mail. Never mind it also came LATE.", "YTA, she did like the purse very much, she just got 2 of them. Exchanging one of them is more than reasonable. Now, where I'm from you usually give the receipt to the person in an envelope with the gift so you don't have to be a part of situations like this.....", "Going against the grain here and saying NTA.\n\nJudy has the option of regifting one of those purses...or, if she really does like that particular purse, saving one so when inevitably the first begins to show wear and tear, they can be swapped out.", "Um...what advantage is the OP going to return the purse? She doesn't have the original or a guest receipt. Some stores will return on your credit card, but many won't. And why can't the giftee take it to the store herself for store credit and then pick something else out. Or regift it. \n\nAsking the gifter to come with you to exchange a gift is ridiculous. EHS.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say NAH. It seems like the second purse, the one you didn't get, arrived after yours so she should be asking the other person for an exchange first not you. It's very possible your cousin did already ask the other person, but if she did that was not made apparent to you. Although, she isn't wrong for asking you first either.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t wanna help her return it, give a gift receipt. That\u2019s why those exist.", "Yeah, YTA. You're 19, and I guess you don't really understand the world yet, so don't take it personally, but there really is no point in insisting someone keep a gift they don't need. If someone wants to return / exchange a present for ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, then fine. I don't think you need to take a day out of your time to help, but you should absolutely have given a gift receipt. I hope they like the thing they decide on. It's not an insult to you. It's being practical.", "Yta.  She's  being practical.  You live closer.\n\nAlways ask for a gift receiot when buying a gift.", "NAH...She asked, you said no.  She'll have to figure something else out.", "If you would've intended for your cousin to be able to return the gift, you would have provided a gift receipt. You did not intend your gift to be returned.\n\nHowever, you also didn't know you and someone else got her the same gift. It makes sense your cousin wants to return one.\n\nAll that said, the fact that you were only told about the duplicate gift when it was an opportunity of convenience kind of rubs me the wrong way. Idk how much time has passed since the party but I'm not fully sold that she even got a duplicate gift. She didn't reach out to you through some other means other than by circumstance. It was very spur of the moment for her to spring that on you and tell you to go to the mall with her for a refund. Also, in my experience it is just as common, or even moreso to get a gift receipt with a gift that was sent via mail because the person who sent it ISN'T in the same area to return it. Why can't that one be returned?\n\nI'm probably being overly cynical here, but the whole abruptness of needing to return the purse at a moment like that just feels so forced and not natural. I'm sure there could be a reasonable explanation for it all, but I just wasn't getting that vibe here. I expect downvotes since Y T A has control of this thread now.\n\nIf there's a reasonable explanation then I think Y T A, but with my reasoning I think NTA. Maybe get some proof so you can actually find out if your cousin is in need of an assist here, then help her out.", "YTA what's wrong with you?", "why don\u2019t she just sell it or take it to said store and exchange it?", "NTA. There's no reason why she couldn't have asked the person who sent the other gift", "YTA\n\nRegardless of if she likes it or not - it's immaterial why she wants to take it back. Maybe she was saving face in front of everyone? Maybe she _does_ have two? Who knows, who cares?\n\nYou can have put a ton of thought into it or just 5 seconds, the point is this is why you provide a receipt with things you give as gifts - to save all this fuss.\n\nThis is awkward for her as well as you - fact is she'd like to return it and there's nothing wrong with you helping her facilitate that.\n\nYour choice has done nothing but damage the relationship between you and if anything guarantees she'll just sell it or find another way to achieve the same end: getting something she _does_ want.\n\nYou could've taken the positive road here and helped her or offered to replace it with a different one - whatever she liked - instead it seems you've chosen to be rather petty all because of \"you\" reasons and not because you're genuinely thoughtful and care.\n\nFolks get gifts they don't want - it happens to all of us and ultimately what matters here is you getting her something she _does_ want and she'd treasure that thought and effort you'd go to - instead, this is what she'll think of you.", "NTA, it's not your responsibility to fix her duplicate gift problem. Maybe she'll learn to communicate better next time.", "Would it make you feel better if she returned the other bag but just got you to help her do it? She liked your gift, and rather than getting less money on eBay, you're in a position to help. Either way, she only needs one purse.

You could even help her selecting another item", "YTA. You just created drama over absolutely nothing. Your attitude towards gift giving should be--do what you want, and if you need to exchange it, here's the receipt. She sounded diplomatic. You're taking this way to personally.", "YTA. So you'd rather she return the other purse, so YOURS is the one she keeps?  Why does it matter?  She loves the gift but obviously doesn't need two.", "NTA. NO is a complete late sentence. She can just go get stuff ore credit.", "YTA", "YTA. When did it become acceptable to give a gift like a purse without the receipt? You always include the receipt for this exact reason. And everything about your subsequent interaction w/ her is petty AF.", "YTA. Why would you want her to have two identical purses?", "Where I live you are NTA as it is considered rude to to return or exchange a gift even when a gift has been doubled, it is even ruder to ask the gift giver for a receipt, it just isn\u2019t done here. That may be different where you live though.", "YTA. I\u2019m failing to see the issue you\u2019re having here. She likes the gift but happened to get two of them. Of course she doesn\u2019t need two. A decent person would help her with the return.", "Whoah. You need to chill. \n\nYour reaction was pretty immature and petty. Your cousin had the right idea.

She just doesn\u2019t need two. So you can help her out, but only don\u2019t want to cos you\u2019re butthurt.", "ESH. Ask her to show you both purses. If she \u201creally\u201d has two of the same exact purse go and return it. If she doesn\u2019t then she really wants the money that you spent on it. Which shows you that you should not put a lot of thought into any future gifts for her.", "I'm mean yeah YTA. She got two purses and yoyr purse was the one easiest to return.

The other purse would have been harder to exchange...she was just hoping to get gull value from the gift if not its wasting your money", "YTA\n\nWhat is the purpose of this gift?\n\nFor the receivers benefit?

She liked the gift, but she got a duplicate, and the other gift giver loves elsewhere and so your purse is the only one she could exchange.", "ESH. It's not a personal slight to want to return a gift. The story about it being a duplicate could be true and it could be a white lie, it doesn't matter. It's disappointing when you put effort into a gift and the person doesn't keep it, but it happens. However, she doesn't need you with her to return the purse, the receipt is enough. I don't know if she was just trying to spend time with you, or if she wanted you to come along so you could spend more money on her, or if she just needed a ride, but it's weird to start the conversation by asking you to go with her.", "YTA. \n\nShe just doesn't need two and you are the most convenient person to get a receipt from. This isn't a personal slight. She can likely take it with tags attached and get store credit without your help, or she will sell it, but in the end, she will end up with one purse, with or without your help.", "ESH", "YTA.

Think OP is jealous of the other cousin.", "YTA, just help her exchange the purse", "YTA. why are you being petty and mean while she\u2019s being practical? It\u2019s an unfortunate circumstance that sometimes duplicate gifts are received. It doesn\u2019t make the gift mean less.", "YTA. It's not her fault she received two of the same thing. \n\nDo you actually even care about Judy or did you just buy her a gift for appearances sake?

I bought her a purse from one of her favorite brands and she was pleased when she opened it at the party (family tradition to open the presents toward the end of the party so the giver could see how happy they made the birthday person). \n\nA couple days ago I ran into Judy at the supermarket. Judy asked me if I still have the receipt of the purse. I said no. She then asked me if I could find the time to go with her to the mall. I asked what was going on and she said the birthday gift from her cousin from the other side who lived in another city just arrived and it was exactly the same purse I bought her. She thought she could exchange my purse for something else since she doesn\u2019t need two of the same thing. So she either needs the receipt or my credit card to return the purse.\n\nI admitted that I was a little upset. I wasn\u2019t particularly close to Judy because her parents moved around a lot until a few years ago, but I put time and effort into getting her this purse. I told Judy that I\u2019m busy and don\u2019t plan on going to the mall anytime soon. I then walked away. Judy followed me and asked why was I being petty and mean when she was just being practical, but I paid for my things and left the supermarket.

It\u2019s pretty unreasonable to be angry that someone bought her the same gift you did. Her request is pretty reasonable, and tells me that she really appreciated your gift - she wants to exchange it, and if you\u2019re there when she does it, you\u2019re still connected to that gift. Also, you ran into her unexpectedly, it was on her mind, so she brought it up - it\u2019s not like she\u2019s been blowing up your phone. Yes, it\u2019s inconvenient for you, but it seems to me that she\u2019s asking if there\u2019s a way you can help her with this that would minimize the inconvenience.

Is she supposed to buy another purse? Give Judy the money? Did Judy ask the other person if they had their receipt? \n\nI don't know this seems off to me.", "YTA. Gift giving is about getting something the other person wants or needs out of kindness, not expecting anything in return. She does not need two purses and it doesn\u2019t matter that she received/opened your gift first.

In this case, she got to of the same and it's a lot more practical to exchange yours. Why does that hurt your ego when it's got nothing to do with you? Would you rather you wasted your money on something she might them sell or regift?", "YTA. The whole point of a gift is to make a person happy. She is not going to be happy with duplicates. She obviously felt close enough to you to be upfront and explain the situation, and you\u2019ve made it weird. Even if it wasn\u2019t duplicates - it\u2019s a personal taste thing, just because she was polite in front of a crowd at a party doesn\u2019t mean she loved it, and she spared your feelings by pretending to like it, and by pretending there are two. Just let her get a damn bag she likes and stop being a d!ck.", "INFO: what would you have liked her to do in this situation?", "You were being kind of bratty about the receipt. But, YTA for just walking away and ignoring her. \n\nYou know it would be easier to return your gift over sending back to another country. If you like her enough to get a nice gift she wanted, which seemed pretty awesome, then continue liking her enough to help her. Maybe do a girl's coffee, catch up and return/refund date.", "Are you serious? Is this real? 100%AH.", "Why didn\u2019t you get a gift receipt or get one reprinted to give her? YTA", "A gift is for the recipient, not for the feeling you get from gifting.", "YTA.  Very definitely. Judy doesn\u2019t need two of the exact same thing and I hope for the rest of your life every gift you receive is the same-and with no receipt.", "YTA...\n\nIf a second purse actually exists and she isn't just returning it and making up this story so that it doesn't hurt your feelings.", "NTA.", "At the risk of being downvoted, NTA or ESH depending on the context. If you don\u2019t have the receipt, you don\u2019t have the receipt, and some stores don\u2019t take returns without the receipt even if you have the card that paid for it (I have run into this problem before with things I bought for myself). Did she confirm with the store she could return it just with the card? Did she explain the situation to the cousin in the other city? That cousin may have their receipt still, and I\u2019d happy stick a receipt in an envelope and ship it USPS to someone who needs it for something like this. Also, how long ago did you buy the purse? I know some stores have a limited return period (like 30 days), and if this store does have a limited return period, are you outside the period? If yes, then there would be nothing Judy could do even if you did have the receipt. It sounds like Judy could ask the cousin in the other city still which means she\u2019s somewhat an AH, but if she has already and the cousin has no receipt either, the return can be made with just the card and it\u2019s still within the return window, the nice thing to do would be to help her (and in that situation, if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re somewhat an AH). If Judy is just being lazy (relying on you because you\u2019re closer and she just doesn\u2019t feel like exploring all options with you and the other cousin), then you\u2019re NTA and she\u2019s the AH.", "NTA, genuinely think everyone voting yta is insane. Sure it would be nice of you to help return it but you have no responsibility to do so. Cry me a river you have two purses? What will she ever doooo?", "YTA grow up.", "NTA.  I\u2019m shocked at all the people saying you are.  You gave a thoughtful, nice gift.  She can either use it, sell it or donate it.   A lot of places would let her exchange the bag without a receipt.", "Depending on brand and store of origin, that might not be an option. I\u2019d have to know just which brand and if it\u2019s an outlet mall or a regular mall. Outlets tend to have a no-return policy for some sales too. There\u2019s lots of factors. \n\n\nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/money/returns-refunds-exchanges/guide-to-returning-gifts-a8582928649/", "NTA. I don\u2019t care how easy it would be to return, I would be upset if someone came to me and asked me to help return something I bought for them.

I'd return the purse and get her another gift, or give her a gift receipt if that's what is offered. I think she's just being sensible, if she is being truthful", "Idk how much time has passed since the party but I'm not totally sold that she even got a duplicate gift.", "Nah I\u2019d almost always say YTA in this situation. Gift giving has become some of the most toxic shit, it\u2019s supposed to be about the recipient, not the giver. Gift receipts should always be included and people need to stop getting pissed off when people don\u2019t like their gifts.", "What context makes badgering someone about an unwanted gift OK? Sometimes you get a duplicate or something you downright don't like. You say thanks and regift/sell/donate/stick it in closet.\n\nMaybe if these two were super close, and cousin knew with certainty it wouldn't cause offense, its ok to ask for a receipt. But if you get any pushback you drop it immediately. Following OP around and berating her is awful.\n\nu/ThrowawayPBaJ NTA. Never come to AITA for a question involving manners.

Now THAT\u2019S tacky.", "[deleted]", "Even if she was returning both, who cares?   So you got her a gift that missed the mark, don\u2019t you want her to choose something she\u2019d love?\n\nOn top of that, her acting exciting in the moment and speaking to you privately later is how it should be.

The one from a person who you see on a regular basis and has access to the physical location they bought the purse or the one who lives in another city?", "It\u2019s a lot harder to return a gift that was given via mail due to the person who sent it possibly living far away. The reason she asked Op is because Op lives close to her\u2026", "I agree NTA. She should have gone to the cousin and said thank you but I just got this last week at the party!\n\nCould we exchange?I\u2019m sure they could email a gift receipt or proof or something. \n\nHonestly if I buy someone a gift and they later got another one and they want me to be the one to switch things up I\u2019m going to say sorry. That\u2019s on you.\n\nI gave kindly and if they want to pick a later gift over the same one I gave them the that\u2019s on them.\n\nWhy in the world would the friend who got a gift to them ON TIME at the party be on the line for retuning the duplicate gift?\n\nThe late gifted who sent the duplicate is the reasonable person to contact in this situation.", "Mailing things on your own without it being through the website you purchased from is super expensive. A Bag could be like $40.", "How was she rude?", "Both OP and the other person gave 'duplicate' gifts. Neither knew it was a duplicate, but it's literally the same gift.

Being rude would be telling OP she needed the receipt to return it because she hated it.  Also one was sent my mail it\u2019s a lot harder to return a gift sent by mail than one given to you in person", "You do realize shipping delays are a thing right? She isn't being rude and if you find THIS rude I pray for anyone close to you.\n\nShe liked the gift but had two. Returning the one from OP makes sense and if op is that upset you can just say \"how about I return it and get you a different gift?\"\n\nAs you said \"gift receipts\" are a thing and shit happens.", "She's the asshole for following him.abd calling him petty", "I don\u2019t know honestly, I think that she should\u2019ve told the cousin that she already received the gift that was exactly like that one , a weeks  prior.\n\nThe friend was very kind and gave her a gift that she wanted.

The cousin should be the one being contacted about exchange of gift since technically hers came in much later.\n\nShe shouldnt go inconvenience the friend already been bought, paid for , and open in front of the whole crowd. \n\n\nI believe birthday girl should have the balls to tell her cousin that her gift that came in late was a duplicate and request an exchange", "They live in a different city.", "what? what are you talking about? communicate what? was she supposed to read everyone\u2019s mind?", "Right? I think it's rude to ask for receipt of the gift, unless you need to make a claim of the product.", "I agree.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t live in a place where that is the expectation. That would drive me nuts. Do people have huge houses or endless storage? Or endless money?", "Just recently I bought some expensive pants for a friend, but wasn't sure she would like them. I gave her the receipt anyway in case she would want to exchange it. There was option to get the money back, but she could still buy something different. I just wanted to make her happy. In the end she loved the gift.", "Wouldn\u2019t you want the recipient of your gift to like it anyway? I don\u2019t know if that matters but it\u2019s a nice way to go about the request than making someone feel bad", "Why?", "Considering there\u2019s an acceptable price point for gifts like this. Not too cheap or expensive plus she has made her favourite bag brand  known. It\u2019s probably something like a long champ/ Coach situation. It\u2019s not too weird.", "Okay? Then she didn\u2019t like the purse and was trying to spare feelings. When I give someone a gift, I want it to be something they actually use.

I've never heard anyone speculate or be bothered about seeing \"proof\" that their gift was actually purchased for them, and I don't necessarily expect people to be careful about keeping receipts when they buy gifts.

Crazy right?!", "I feel like people are giving this person too many points, because one person is their cousin who sent the late gift, and the other persons a friend who was there at the party on time with a gift in hand.\n\nSo we\u2019re saying just because it\u2019s their cousin the friend who was thoughtful and on time gets to go through the hassle of a return? Just because she\u2019s not the cousin? Yikes", "I think a lot of you NTA have issues with your relationships.

The cousin who purchased the item online and sent it after the party can you simply email the receipt and initiate a return on their end and send back according to how the company specifies.
