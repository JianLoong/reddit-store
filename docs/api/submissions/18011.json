He's always been a jerk, despite having awesome parents. Now he's 34, but the type who can't hold down a job. He's blown every chance he's had, and most family are done trying to help him. He gets fired from most places he works because he's a misogynist who cracks crass jokes about women, and makes nasty racial comments. He referred to my neighbor's kids as \"n-glets\" - as you might guess, my neighbors are Black. Our other neighbors have a Pride flag, which he calls the \"F-g flag\".\n\nMy wife and I are unfortunate enough that he lives down the street from us. Our uncle left him his house when he died, since they had the same attitude.  He'll wander by and pester us when we're in the yard. I've called the cops on him twice for trespassing, which has only resulted in them walking him down the street to his house. \n\nBecause my brother is how he is, I refuse to use his name under any circumstances (the only time I would is if I were required to make a legal statement). If I refer to him by anything than \"my brother\" it's by an insult. Whatever comes to mind at the moment. To his face I've called him: Failure, scumbag, Useless, 'a reason to be pro-choice', freeloader, and a whole bunch of names that center around profanity, his getting  fired regularly, and that he hasn't had a girlfriend in 8 years. My wife hates him too, but doesn't really join in on the petty name calling. \n\nThe other day, he came by asking to borrow money for groceries. I laughed in his face, said \"Not my problem, failure. Go eat out of the dumpster behind  McDonald's if you want food.\" and closed the door. Note: His way of asking was \"Hey I'm out of money, give me some cash for groceries.\" \n\nMy sister-in-law was over, and was horrified. She tore into me, not listening to what my wife or I said about how he acts. She took the \"he's your brother!\" line, and actually ran after him to hand him cash. I also got an earful from her husband, who'd offered to go on a beer run for dinner that night. Same thing, he's my brother, I'm bound by blood to at least make sure he eats. \n\nSo I'm given *some* pause on this. I treat my brother with open, blatant contempt, and have for years because he's a hateful bigot. I've never considered him to be *worth* helping, because he seems to be determined to never take responsibility and never tries to be a better person. \n\nAITA for being this way with him?", "created_utc": 1684873910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pztzh/aita_for_refusing_to_use_my_brothers_name_ever/", "score": 1503, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(As a side note, why on Earth would he feel justified in asking/demanding you give him money after all this time? Is he just that clueless?)\n\nMaybe it's time for a change.

Years ago,I was nice enough to drive to the next town (very bad area) to bring him to my house to help him with taxes. What did we get for THAT? Bedbugs. F---ing bed bugs. I DIDN'T know that his house at the time, was infested with fleas, roaches, lice and bedbugs. His response? \"Oh? Huh. My bad.\" Cost us THOUSANDS. When my husband's mother moved in with us, we have a few rules, but one that will NOT be broken for ANY reason is, her other son is NOT allowed here. \"but he's my son.\" IDGAF. He has kids that other men are raising. He lies to the state to get all the assistance you can think of. He drinks and smokes most of the money he gets. If he doesn't get his way, he claims he's going to unalive himself to try to get attention. He uses the threat as a tool to get his way. He's a manipulative ass. I can't stand people like that.  Maybe he and your brother can be friends.", "ESH. In your own way, you\u2019re just as much a jerk and a bigot as your brother.", "ESH - You have no obligation to your brother and I have no issue with you blatantly making your feelings for him clear, but acting that way in front of other people is really uncomfortable, rude, and socially awkward.

But that edition is searchable on amazon.com and although it has a section titled \u201cBlood is thicker than water\u201d, this passage is not found there. Additionally, the first (1885), second (1893) and third (1898) editions of The Blood Covenant are all available on the Internet Archive and none contains this passage. I can only conclude that Lindemann\u2019s citation of this passage to Trumbull is in error, and either:\n\n1) Lindemann invented the passage (but this seems unlikely because of the close similarity with Pustelniak); or\n\n2) Lindemann got the passage from someone else (from Pustelniak\u2019s source or from Pustelniak himself).\n\nConclusion:\n\nMy theory is that the myth of the \u201coriginal meaning\u201d of the phrase was accidentally created by Henry Clay Trumbull, whose chapter on blood brotherhood in The Blood Covenant (1885) is titled \u201cBlood is thicker than water\u201d.

I think the brother sounds absolutely horrible.  I just don' think that being horrible back is the correct response.  Setting the boundary of having no contact is a choice that keeps the OP from looking bad to others that don't know the story of why he doesn't like his brother and allows the OP to keep his own dignity.
