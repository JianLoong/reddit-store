He's always been a jerk, despite having awesome parents. Now he's 34, but the type who can't hold down a job. He's blown every chance he's had, and most family are done trying to help him. He gets fired from most places he works because he's a misogynist who cracks crass jokes about women, and makes nasty racial comments. He referred to my neighbor's kids as \"n-glets\" - as you might guess, my neighbors are Black. Our other neighbors have a Pride flag, which he calls the \"F-g flag\".\n\nMy wife and I are unfortunate enough that he lives down the street from us. Our uncle left him his house when he died, since they had the same attitude.  He'll wander by and pester us when we're in the yard. I've called the cops on him twice for trespassing, which has only resulted in them walking him down the street to his house. \n\nBecause my brother is how he is, I refuse to use his name under any circumstances (the only time I would is if I were required to make a legal statement). If I refer to him by anything than \"my brother\" it's by an insult. Whatever comes to mind at the moment. To his face I've called him: Failure, scumbag, Useless, 'a reason to be pro-choice', freeloader, and a whole bunch of names that center around profanity, his getting  fired regularly, and that he hasn't had a girlfriend in 8 years. My wife hates him too, but doesn't really join in on the petty name calling. \n\nThe other day, he came by asking to borrow money for groceries. I laughed in his face, said \"Not my problem, failure. Go eat out of the dumpster behind  McDonald's if you want food.\" and closed the door. Note: His way of asking was \"Hey I'm out of money, give me some cash for groceries.\" \n\nMy sister-in-law was over, and was horrified. She tore into me, not listening to what my wife or I said about how he acts. She took the \"he's your brother!\" line, and actually ran after him to hand him cash. I also got an earful from her husband, who'd offered to go on a beer run for dinner that night. Same thing, he's my brother, I'm bound by blood to at least make sure he eats. \n\nSo I'm given *some* pause on this. I treat my brother with open, blatant contempt, and have for years because he's a hateful bigot. I've never considered him to be *worth* helping, because he seems to be determined to never take responsibility and never tries to be a better person. \n\nAITA for being this way with him?", "created_utc": 1684873910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pztzh/aita_for_refusing_to_use_my_brothers_name_ever/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, it might look like that to others who overhear your exchanges, but your history with this person shows otherwise.

I'm not a person who thinks all bigots really just need a hug but it's been what, 15 years or more and he's still acting like garbage? (As a side note, why on Earth would he feel justified in asking/demanding you give him money after all this time? Is he just that clueless?)\n\nMaybe it's time for a change.

Years ago,I was nice enough to drive to the next town (very bad area) to bring him to my house to help him with taxes. What did we get for THAT? Bedbugs. F---ing bed bugs. I DIDN'T know that his house at the time, was infested with fleas, roaches, lice and bedbugs. His response? \"Oh? Huh. My bad.\" Cost us THOUSANDS. When my husband's mother moved in with us, we have a few rules, but one that will NOT be broken for ANY reason is, her other son is NOT allowed here. \"but he's my son.\" IDGAF. He has kids that other men are raising. He lies to the state to get all the assistance you can think of. He drinks and smokes most of the money he gets. If he doesn't get his way, he claims he's going to unalive himself to try to get attention. He uses the threat as a tool to get his way. He's a manipulative ass. I can't stand people like that.  Maybe he and your brother can be friends.", "ESH.

It must be so unpleasant to be near either of you.\n\nEdit: no, you have no obligation to give him any money. Blood relation or not.", "ESH. I do not blame you for disliking your bro.

Your brother has mental  health issues. Calling him names isn't going to fix that. You absolutely do not need him in your life and you should be grey-rocking him, but being an asshole doesn't help anything.", "ESH, brother for being annoying, misogynist, racist  and expecting you to give money, and you for using deliberately insulting language. sure, you don\u2019t need to use his name but you can just not open the door OR talk like an adult. you need some therapy too if you think talking like that is somehow ok, maybe neither of your childhood was that great, you\u2019re just better at pretending.", "If your sole reason for constantly shitting on your brother is that he\u2019s a bigot, yeah YTA. Being a bigot is bad, yes. It\u2019s awful and it\u2019s fine to not like someone even if they\u2019re family because of it.

He always had an attitude, but during college and after it blew up into him becoming a lazy, racist, homophobic, any sort of \"ist\" you can imagine. \n\nHis mom is lovely, his sister is a gem, he's just an bigoted, self-centred lazy asshole. Awful awful person, no cognitive disability, just a jerk.", "> To his face I've called him: Failure, scumbag, Useless, 'a reason to be pro-choice', freeloader, and a whole bunch of names that center around profanity\n\nI don't know how years of that level of name-calling is helping him feel better, especially when it involves that much negativity.\n\nIf his brother lives that close, maybe OP should consider moving away. It sucks for OP to be forced to move to avoid his POS brother, but I doubt he's going to leave the area voluntarily and I think it would be better for OP's mental health: I think OP's brother enjoys antagonizing him, hence the demand for money from a man he knows hates his guts.", "Didn\u2019t mean to imply she didn\u2019t have your back. Meant more that she can say things like \u201cshut up, stupid\u201d to her sister because they\u2019re sisters whereas you just kinda have to be \u201cum, you really don\u2019t understand\u201d and hope she listens\u2026if that makes sense. LOL", "Big fan of your username \ud83e\udd29", "Yep. Those are not markers of a healthy mind. He has issues. He may not be mentally ill, but he is not mentally healthy, clearly.", "So, do you think a mentally healthy person is unable to hold down a job, alienates all family, and is an eternal bigot? That's clearly not a mentally healthy person, whether or not he has a diagnosable disorder.", "Being a bigot is being unempathetic. Being unempathetic is usually the result of trauma or some conditioning that makes you disconnected from  your own emotions, and thereby unable to consider the emotions of others.", "He can't keep down a job. He drives away everyone close to him. He's an unsympathetic bigot. Those are all great markers of a mentally unhealthy person. I'm not saying he has a diagnosable disorder, but he is clearly not in a good mental space.", "Sounds like you also could use some therapy. This is not a measured response.", "This is giving \u201cI took one undergrad psych class and now I think I\u2019m an expert.\u201d Bigots are bigots because they embrace white supremacy culture and believe that they\u2019re superior to whatever group they\u2019re harming. It has *nothing* to do with mental health. Are there mentally ill bigots? Sure, but there are also plenty without mental health issues. \n\nExcusing bigotry and hate as a \u201cmental health\u201d issue takes the accountability off of the person engaging in bigotry while simultaneously reinforcing the negative stigma mental illness already has. Stop perpetuating incorrect, harmful stereotypes.", "They're all great markers of assholes, too. Are there any assholes you would brand mentally healthy, taking that route?", "Thank you doc mcstuffins. Care to diagnose anyone else while we have you for the full hour?"]}
