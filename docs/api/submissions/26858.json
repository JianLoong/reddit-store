The fact half of the class has a zero because of your system says a lot about your teaching methods, or lack thereof in this circumstance. If you are showing them, it is not getting through. You are the adult and the teacher, it is your job to help them succeed. Not sit back and watch them fail. \n\nAlso the principal already asked you to be more lenient, you should listen to your superiors advice. They are correct on this matter. Honestly if it was my kid, I would have had them moved to another class already. I need teachers and mentors for my kid, not someone who can't be bothered to spend more time with their students.
