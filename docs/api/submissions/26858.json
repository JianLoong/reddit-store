Honestly if it was my kid, I would have had them moved to another class already. I need teachers and mentors for my kid, not someone who can't be bothered to spend more time with their students.

It's something you need to teach them, and part of teaching is helping them learn from mistakes. It's frustrating when they don't follow instructions, but repeating yourself often and dealing with the frustration is part of the job.

Teachers get real high and mighty about students using chat gpt but they automate most of their job. I had a college class where we had an online code from the publisher and we did all the quizzes and homework from their site. It was all multiple choice so I know damn well the professor didn't write or grade any of his assignments. He also clearly never even looked at what he was assigning us because if we asked follow up questions he never knew what we were talking about. This was years ago, I can't imagine how teachers are running their classes now. \n\nIt sounds like this is a poorly implemented mandatory last minute computer class, I'm not surprised half your class can't figure it out.

If I was in high school I honestly would think you were just being overly picky and give even less effort, and I am a people pleaser.\n\nMaybe take so time to explain why the rule exists and give them an opportunity to fix the submission errors without penalty.

Also, assuming you're also in the US, the American education system is just sad.\n\nBut the other big part of it is that, while we expected kids to come in to school as technology experts, the opposite has happened because technology has become so easy to use. They've never had to troubleshoot when a program isn't running, or spend hours organizing files or correcting metadata. Hell, most of my student workers/interns come into our office not understanding that there's a difference in how you save a document while using a desktop program like Word or Excel, and why it doesn't just auto save like it does in Google Docs.\n\nI'm not a teacher. I'm not going to pretend to know what modern pedagogy would say to do in a situation like this.

You're seeing symptoms of a larger issue. The format of a file name is not important in high school. We like to pretend we're preparing students for \"adulthood,\" but it's such a low priority item that they'll learn on the job on Day 1. \n\nYou're holding your ground instead of *teaching*.

My experience with students born after ~2000-2003 is that they often don\u2019t have a good understanding of what\u2019s actually happening behind the curtain, so to speak, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s their fault. It used to be that operating systems were more rigid and less accommodating of mistakes, and that taught people some of the mechanics by necessity. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask for them to follow the requested naming convention. It\u2019s exponentially harder to grade (and return!) an assignment with non-standard names. Even in my last course of ~40 students in my section, that was enough to cause chaos in my gradebook and filing system. \n\nPersonally, I gave my students a walkthrough on exactly what I meant & how to do so during syllabus week, and emailed each student who didn\u2019t follow directions individually to resubmit under the proper naming convention without a late penalty on the first assignment. After the first individual reminder, I asked them to resubmit and applied a late penalty.

If not, then they need to fill the gap themselves.\n\nI will say, my university has this same issue, and so they created a new course specifically to teach the basics, which could work here but obviously isn\u2019t a solution for you.
