The kind who think your kid owes you all of their love and respect just because you.... did your job as a parent? I have two kids and guess what? Getting them where they are today is my job. They didn't ask to be born, I decided that, so now it's my job to unconditionally love them and provide their needs to them. It's not some favor I'm doing for them.   \n\n\nTelling your kid what to talk about in therapy is crossing such a huge boundary. First off it shows a huge misunderstanding of what therapy is.

Therapy is for him to feel heard. Every therapist understands that their client\u2019s view is one-sided and will likely show bias (even if it is unintentional).

Neutrality is for the therapist. You commenting, is low key insecurity on your part; & shouldn't matter to you, because therapist's aren't social reporters for tabloids.\n\n2nd, parent or not, he's of adult age. He has every right to be angry, even if listening was accidental, & can verbally express his distress. That has NOTHING to do with you being a parent, because both of you are adults & can speak as such. You reacted, instead of acknowledging & reinforcing your remorse for overstepping - which unnecessarily escalated the conversation. Using language that's unsavory to you, may be perfect for his way of communicating his displeasure. Take it with a grain of salt, and not personally.\n\nIn hindsight, you do see your mistake. It would be exemplary for you NOW, as the parent, to ask him to have a calm conversation so you could genuinely apologize for mistakenly overhearing his session. Then, follow through with the conversation, and be a hero for your wife by \"saving Christmas\".\n\nUnderstand, that there may be a lot of baggage he needs to unpack in therapy; even if you can't fathom what his perspective is. If he has undiagnosed conditions, this is why he reacts so strongly & dramatically. You may be neurotypical, but he may not be - and that can be hard to deal with if he doesn't know how to identify his triggers, & have healthy coping mechanisms yet. Perhaps you investing time in understanding what (if anything) is causing his brain to work the way it does (atypical wiring, hormone imbalances, etc), can result in better communication, and a better & healthier relationship, in the long run.", "YTA.\n\nNot for accidentally hearing part of his conversation but for trying to dictate what your adult son tells his therapist.", "YTA to the biggest degree.

It seems that your kid is not afraid of going hungry or whether he can afford a roof over his head. He can get therapy which is more than a lot of people can do. Those things don't make you a great parent but they are a lot better than others have. If you want to classify your kid as an entitled shit, then do it.

My therapist was so proud of me when I told a story from my childhood and instead of immediately going into excuse mode for something horrible my mother did to me, I just talked about my side. She told me that\u2019s a big step in recovery. The therapist isn\u2019t interested in hearing both sides in solo care. They\u2019re interested to see how your brain and emotions work and how to best treat your current emotional state. It has NOTHING to do with your side as his dad and I have a sneaking suspicion we just got a little glance into why your son needs therapy in the first place. I hope this has been a learning experience for you.\n\nETA- sorry forgot to put YTA", "YTA.  \n\nWhat your son discusses with his therapist, and how, is none of your g@%-damned business.

Your reaction to it is.  You could have kept your mouth shut and let him have his privacy. You could have let him know that you heard him while staying completely neutral yourself. But no, you tried to force him to say what YOU wanted to hear. \n\nThe other commenters are right, you really DON'T understand how therapy works. And even though you're trying to 'apologize' now, I can certainly see why your son is getting therapy with parents like you.", "The whole point of therapy is that it\u2019s one sided.

Why do you feel the need to try to tell your son what to talk about with his therapist? You don't think a trained therapist knows how to assess their patient? You only get like an hour with a therapist and you want him to spend the time talking about the good things? Those aren't the things he's in therapy for, why would he waste time talking about them? And you don't think a therapist knows that they are getting a condensed version of things? You think the therapist believes their patient is fitting their whole life story into one hour?

The therapist is there to help him work through what his experiences are, and what he's feeling. \n\nHim censoring those emotions to give what YOU think is the situation with his therapist is not going to help him through what he's dealing with, and frankly it doesn't sound like he has any interest in doing that anyway.\n\nIf you continue pushing those boundaries, you're definitely going to be TA, and it sounds like your son is more than willing to make some distance between the two of you if he doesn't feel like you can respect his space.", "If you want to share your side then get your own therapist and paint yourself with kitties & rainbows all you want, you have ZERO say so in what your ADULT son says to his therapist.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIt's understandable that you would want to offer advice to your son and help him get the best treatment possible.

Your suggestion to be neutral with his therapist may have come from a good place, but it's not your decision to make. It's important to respect your son's privacy and boundaries and let him handle his therapy as he sees fit.

The entire experience is about the person getting the therapy and how they feel/felt and whatever they went through from their point of view.  This is incredibly private.

It was not your place to talk about it and you know that. So of course your wife is mad at you for ruining the holidays ahead.\n\nAnd please educate yourself about therapy. A therapist isn't a judge. He offers a safe place where the client can explore and understand their emotions and motivations. It's not a courtroom.\n\nListen to your wife. Apologize to your son, admit that you didn't understand the concept and that you're sorry for overstepping that boundary.", "YTA he isn\u2019t there to get a judgement of you.

Luckily my mother agreed with me and he was in the wrong. I'm sure other people have said it but therapy is a way to vent in a positive manner. I've straight up just screamed to oblivion in therapy before because my therapist suggested it might be beneficial and no one was in the building but us. \n\nI'm not there venting because I want someone to agree with me and paying them to agree with me. No. I'm paying them to listen but tell me that I'm right or wrong and ask deeper questions if it doesn't make sense why I'm that angry about whatever it is and get to the root of the problem. I'm there to heal myself and move forward. You just took a huge step back by bringing it up - therapy is not about you. If you want to explain yourself and the good things you've done you can ask for a family session to \"right your wrongs\" and likely be told you're being a dick in the nicest way possible", "YTA. Sounds like you need therapy, ick. Get help and be a better parent.", "YTA\n\nTherapy is, or should be, a safe space where someone can vent and talk about THEIR feelings without filter or fear of judgement. Therapy is about the person in therapy, but you made it about yourself while hurting and violating your son's privacy and trust. Allowing someone that space to vent and work through things can often lead to better relationships and communication with the person they are venting about. I'm not sure how you can fix this, and I really do mean this sincerely even though it's probably going to come across as snarky or whatever, but I would encourage you to talk to a therapist about what happened and hope they can help you figure out what you need to do to have a relationship with your son. Or at least help you understand what you did and why this will take so much more than just apologizing.", "Yta you have no clue how therapy works do you. You sound like my mom who thinks she was this great parent but wasn't.", "YTA\n\nAnd consider the way you think about things. You *had* to bark back? Did you? Did you really?

Did you *have* to do that too?", "YTA, stop trying to micromanage your kid's emotions. Their therapy isn't about what makes you comfortable. If they're telling their therapist you're awful maybe take that as a hint", "Well I can see why your son needs therapy. With a parent like you I'd need therapy too. YTA", ">Later that evening at dinner, I told my son that I think it would be best if he was neutral with his therapist so that they can come to a judgement regarding all sides of an issue, and that he should include more of the good things we\u2019ve done for him so that things aren\u2019t as one sided, and that he can get the best treatment he needs.\n\nYeah, that's not what therapy is about. In point of fact, it's the sign of a bad therapist who aggressively urges their clients based off personal biases with some rare exceptions in the extreme. There is in fact a reason why different specialized therapists exist after all, such as those who help people explore their issues with their parents and decide whether to become estranged or not. Ultimately, a therapist should be helping an individual seek what's best for them, not passing judgement, or encouraging them to the benefit of people that aren't the client in question.\n\n>I had to bark back that he does not curse at us and he needs to respect us because we are his parents who have helped him get to where he is today, to which he just picked up his bowl and left the dinner table, going to his room. I tried to later knock on his door and say sorry but didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nSo, in the face of someone you're talking down to, you lost your cool and tried to shut him down with the age old, \"we're your parents and you owe us,\" line of logic.

That's making you feel uncomfortable with what you heard.\n\nBut a good therapist isn't just going to be a yes man for anything and everything our clients say. We hear the initial self-expression, and guide our client through their cognitive/emotional processing and help them identify effective and healthy ways to meet their needs. Sometimes that absolutely does mean validating their experience of something! Other times it may mean challenging how they interpret things.\n\nRegardless of which approach your son's therapist is using for the session content you overheard, all asking him to \"be more neutral\" is going to do is alienate him. I can promise you that. I have never had a client who struggled in their relationship with someone and was brought closer to them by being prompted to prioritize that person's feeling in their therapy session. If you want your side to be represented in your son's experience of mental health care, suggest family therapy, but keep your nose out of his individual sessions.

But I can tell you that the decisions you have made here were never going to improve that relationship.

Your son's therapist is a professional with specific training around how to navigate/interpret self-reported symptoms and experiences from patients.
