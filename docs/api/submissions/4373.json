The kind who think your kid owes you all of their love and respect just because you.... did your job as a parent? I have two kids and guess what? Getting them where they are today is my job. They didn't ask to be born, I decided that, so now it's my job to unconditionally love them and provide their needs to them. It's not some favor I'm doing for them.   \n\n\nTelling your kid what to talk about in therapy is crossing such a huge boundary. First off it shows a huge misunderstanding of what therapy is.

Therapy is for him to feel heard. Every therapist understands that their client\u2019s view is one-sided and will likely show bias (even if it is unintentional).

Neutrality is for the therapist. You commenting, is low key insecurity on your part; & shouldn't matter to you, because therapist's aren't social reporters for tabloids.\n\n2nd, parent or not, he's of adult age. He has every right to be angry, even if listening was accidental, & can verbally express his distress. That has NOTHING to do with you being a parent, because both of you are adults & can speak as such. You reacted, instead of acknowledging & reinforcing your remorse for overstepping - which unnecessarily escalated the conversation. Using language that's unsavory to you, may be perfect for his way of communicating his displeasure. Take it with a grain of salt, and not personally.\n\nIn hindsight, you do see your mistake. It would be exemplary for you NOW, as the parent, to ask him to have a calm conversation so you could genuinely apologize for mistakenly overhearing his session. Then, follow through with the conversation, and be a hero for your wife by \"saving Christmas\".\n\nUnderstand, that there may be a lot of baggage he needs to unpack in therapy; even if you can't fathom what his perspective is. If he has undiagnosed conditions, this is why he reacts so strongly & dramatically. You may be neurotypical, but he may not be - and that can be hard to deal with if he doesn't know how to identify his triggers, & have healthy coping mechanisms yet.

It seems that your kid is not afraid of going hungry or whether he can afford a roof over his head. He can get therapy which is more than a lot of people can do. Those things don't make you a great parent but they are a lot better than others have. If you want to classify your kid as an entitled shit, then do it.

My therapist was so proud of me when I told a story from my childhood and instead of immediately going into excuse mode for something horrible my mother did to me, I just talked about my side. She told me that\u2019s a big step in recovery. The therapist isn\u2019t interested in hearing both sides in solo care. They\u2019re interested to see how your brain and emotions work and how to best treat your current emotional state.

Your reaction to it is.  You could have kept your mouth shut and let him have his privacy. You could have let him know that you heard him while staying completely neutral yourself. But no, you tried to force him to say what YOU wanted to hear. \n\nThe other commenters are right, you really DON'T understand how therapy works. And even though you're trying to 'apologize' now, I can certainly see why your son is getting therapy with parents like you.", "The whole point of therapy is that it\u2019s one sided.

Why do you feel the need to try to tell your son what to talk about with his therapist? You don't think a trained therapist knows how to assess their patient? You only get like an hour with a therapist and you want him to spend the time talking about the good things? Those aren't the things he's in therapy for, why would he waste time talking about them? And you don't think a therapist knows that they are getting a condensed version of things? You think the therapist believes their patient is fitting their whole life story into one hour?

The therapist is there to help him work through what his experiences are, and what he's feeling. \n\nHim censoring those emotions to give what YOU think is the situation with his therapist is not going to help him through what he's dealing with, and frankly it doesn't sound like he has any interest in doing that anyway.\n\nIf you continue pushing those boundaries, you're definitely going to be TA, and it sounds like your son is more than willing to make some distance between the two of you if he doesn't feel like you can respect his space.", "If you want to share your side then get your own therapist and paint yourself with kitties & rainbows all you want, you have ZERO say so in what your ADULT son says to his therapist.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIt's understandable that you would want to offer advice to your son and help him get the best treatment possible.

Your suggestion to be neutral with his therapist may have come from a good place, but it's not your decision to make. It's important to respect your son's privacy and boundaries and let him handle his therapy as he sees fit.

The entire experience is about the person getting the therapy and how they feel/felt and whatever they went through from their point of view.  This is incredibly private.

You could have respected your son's privacy, simply by saying NOTHING.", "YTA. You violated your son\u2019s right to privacy concerning his medical information in such an extreme way. Tbh I see why he\u2019s in therapy if you\u2019re so concerned with/had the actual audacity to tell your son what to tell his therapist about you so you don\u2019t look as bad. \n\nJesus fucking Christ dude, get a grip. Maybe go to therapy yourself because you\u2019re beyond fucked up.\n\nEdit for typo", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, you really should've kept your mouth shut and not comment on his session at all. It was not your place to talk about it and you know that. So of course your wife is mad at you for ruining the holidays ahead.\n\nAnd please educate yourself about therapy. A therapist isn't a judge. He offers a safe place where the client can explore and understand their emotions and motivations. It's not a courtroom.\n\nListen to your wife. Apologize to your son, admit that you didn't understand the concept and that you're sorry for overstepping that boundary.", "YTA he isn\u2019t there to get a judgement of you. He is there to deal with his feelings towards you and others. He needs to deal with his own mental health issues without your input because it isn\u2019t helpful.", "YTA.\n\nOP, your last paragraph reads like you\u2019re trying to justify how you felt to your son, which clearly shows you don\u2019t see the problem. Your son\u2019s therapy sessions are between him and his therapist unless he chooses otherwise; you do not get to dictate his feelings. \n\nNone of this is \u201ceating you up\u201d you just don\u2019t want your wife pissed at you, you would be taking accountability instead of trying to make it seem like it wasn\u2019t your fault - your use of potentially speaks volumes \n\nI hope your wife goes and spends Christmas with your son, leaving you to be alone", "YTA - my father also did this to me. Luckily my mother agreed with me and he was in the wrong. I'm sure other people have said it but therapy is a way to vent in a positive manner. I've straight up just screamed to oblivion in therapy before because my therapist suggested it might be beneficial and no one was in the building but us. \n\nI'm not there venting because I want someone to agree with me and paying them to agree with me. No. I'm paying them to listen but tell me that I'm right or wrong and ask deeper questions if it doesn't make sense why I'm that angry about whatever it is and get to the root of the problem. I'm there to heal myself and move forward. You just took a huge step back by bringing it up - therapy is not about you. If you want to explain yourself and the good things you've done you can ask for a family session to \"right your wrongs\" and likely be told you're being a dick in the nicest way possible", "YTA. Sounds like you need therapy, ick. Get help and be a better parent.", "YTA\n\nTherapy is, or should be, a safe space where someone can vent and talk about THEIR feelings without filter or fear of judgement. Therapy is about the person in therapy, but you made it about yourself while hurting and violating your son's privacy and trust. Allowing someone that space to vent and work through things can often lead to better relationships and communication with the person they are venting about. I'm not sure how you can fix this, and I really do mean this sincerely even though it's probably going to come across as snarky or whatever, but I would encourage you to talk to a therapist about what happened and hope they can help you figure out what you need to do to have a relationship with your son. Or at least help you understand what you did and why this will take so much more than just apologizing.", "Yta you have no clue how therapy works do you. You sound like my mom who thinks she was this great parent but wasn't.", "YTA\n\nAnd consider the way you think about things. You *had* to bark back? Did you? Did you really? You're just making excuses saying you had to do it so you don't take responsibility for choosing to so it\n\nAlso why on earth would it be your place to tell him what he should say to your therapist? Did you *have* to do that too?", "YTA, stop trying to micromanage your kid's emotions. Their therapy isn't about what makes you comfortable. If they're telling their therapist you're awful maybe take that as a hint", "Well I can see why your son needs therapy. With a parent like you I'd need therapy too. YTA", ">Later that evening at dinner, I told my son that I think it would be best if he was neutral with his therapist so that they can come to a judgement regarding all sides of an issue, and that he should include more of the good things we\u2019ve done for him so that things aren\u2019t as one sided, and that he can get the best treatment he needs.\n\nYeah, that's not what therapy is about. In point of fact, it's the sign of a bad therapist who aggressively urges their clients based off personal biases with some rare exceptions in the extreme. There is in fact a reason why different specialized therapists exist after all, such as those who help people explore their issues with their parents and decide whether to become estranged or not. Ultimately, a therapist should be helping an individual seek what's best for them, not passing judgement, or encouraging them to the benefit of people that aren't the client in question.\n\n>I had to bark back that he does not curse at us and he needs to respect us because we are his parents who have helped him get to where he is today, to which he just picked up his bowl and left the dinner table, going to his room. I tried to later knock on his door and say sorry but didn\u2019t get a response.\n\nSo, in the face of someone you're talking down to, you lost your cool and tried to shut him down with the age old, \"we're your parents and you owe us,\" line of logic. Real mature.\n\nYes, YTA in this situation for policing what your son says in confidence, for policing what he says when you tried to police him, and for being so goddamn oblivious about the fact that it is entirely your fault.", "YTA, for the eavesdropping alone. How dare you try and make your child\u2019s therapy **about you** and making you look good.", "YTA \nSeriously ? He is an adult. Even as a teen/child they should be allowed privacy with a therapist. This is really really \ud83e\udee5\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "YTA\n\nRead your post again and maybe highlight all the things you got wrong. Hint: there\u2019s quite a few.", "That\u2019s uhhh not how therapy works bud, your son was doing it right\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Here\u2019s what happened: you heard your son talking about the damage that you caused (and that deep down you know is true) but because your* ego is so large, you won\u2019t ever admit that you failed. And you now want to keep up the pretends, so even the therapist knowing you suck is a threat to you. And so you try and gaslight him saying that it\u2019ll \u201chelp his treatment\u201d better, and that\u2019s why you think it\u2019d be best. (Really it\u2019s about you) You don\u2019t give a fuck about your son, otherwise you would\u2019ve been heartbroken that he felt hurt by you (even if you didn\u2019t think you did anything). Any parent would hear stuff like that and be *sad* \u2026 Not deflect responsibility and belittle their child\u2019s feelings", "YTA. \"we are his parents who have helped him get to where he is today\" Yeah. In therapy. And by the way, you don't get to tell him how to talk to his therapist. Not yours.", "YTA. he was expressing his emotions...that's kinda what therapy is for. and saying that he NEEDS to respecting just bc your his parents is fucking laughable, especially after telling him that you need his therapist to think good things about you. no wonder he has so much resentment towards you, you sound like a grade A narcissist.", "Well, no wonder he\u2019s in therapy.\n\nYTA", "This is laughable! My mother once yelled at me because she felt insecure that I went to therapy and she didn't want me \"talking shit about her\" to my therapist. Needless to say, I am not close with my mother. YTA therapy is for your kid to work through his own issues", "Hmm\u2026 it\u2019s never nice to \u201coverhear\u201d anyone\u2019s private session with their therapist", "YTA\n\nIn what world do people make suggestions to others about what they should and shouldn't discuss with their therapist? Geez", "YTA\nIt's clear why the kid needs therapy. Controlling asshole fathers are a nightmare.", "OP, your son does not like you or your wife. I think you should consider that whenever you choose to engage with him in the future. Keep it neutral, short, and as inoffensive as possible.", "NTA", "Esh. \n\nEveryone is an ah. \n\nIf you are being loud in therapy ........ even in a private session, ppl will hear you. \n\n\nBut holy cow batman, \n\nI think you and tge wife need parenting classes and some therapy. \n\nCan potentially ruin christmas if it is not made up to him? \n\nYall raised an entitled person from an entitled person. And you dont handle conflict well or the possible bad light shown on you. \n\nGet over it, your kid is a drama king. Hence therapy, but yall need to learn a better way to respond than to get guilted into complying.", "If anything, the only judging they do is to give you the possibility that a situation might be different than you expected and MAYBE JUST MAYBE there\u2019s other ways to react to it. \nOP is TA, though I don\u2019t agree with their child\u2019s choice of words", "OP seems to be conflating this sub with therapy.", "I just read in another post something like \"if the telling of your conduct paints you in a bad light...it's not the telling that's bad, it's your conduct.\"\n\nSeems to fit here.", "The \"we helped you get where you are\" was pretty ironic, considering he's in therapy.", "My mother DEFINITELY would & that\u2019s why I\u2019m no contact with her. \n\nThat\u2019s your future OP if you keep behaving like this. YTA", "I don't think a patronizing comment from dad is going to help this situation.", "He didn't say the kid was lying - just that he was focusing on the bad parts. Which is sort of what you do in therapy, you talk about what hurt you. \n\n OP never denies any of the bad things they have done, they just want the good parts included.\n\nActually, they don't even know if the son mentioned the good parts, because they just overheard the venting.\n\n If the therapist is any good at their job, they would already know an angry 21 year old won't be giving them an unbiased version.\n\n No one gives unbiased stories in therapy. If you are able to have a healthy, unbiased look at your life, you likely don't need therapy.", "\u2026thats what you took away from this?!", "Wonder if we'll be hearing about the PowerPoint slides this man got soon?", "Saw that, too. That's wisdom right there.", "I think how OP responds to his son's awful behavior is more important than a dumb judgment. Obviously nobody is handling the relationships well, and I think OP can handle it better in the future.", "Exaaaaactly.", "What awful behavior? He was venting to his therapist.", ">  He was venting to his therapist\n\nloud enough for the people in the other room he's complaining about can hear him. loud and inconsiderate.\n\nhe swore at his parents over a perceived transgression that did not occur, then, instead of apologizing as his parents had, he swore at them again and told them to \"keep their fucking mouths shut\" in their own house, at their own table. while they're feeding him dinner.\n\nlike, a stronger family would've kicked him out for saying that. he is 21, not 15, he is too old to think he can act however he wants without consequences. I can only assume this isn't the first or fifth or fiftieth time his mother has coddled his awful behavior.", "Well if OP and his wife didn't do bad things, the son wouldn't need a therapist to begin. If you do bad enough things that warrants your kid seeking therapy, he doesn't owe you respect. He's back to his dorm now so what's the problem?"]}
