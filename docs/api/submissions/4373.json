Get over yourself and maybe, instead of telling your son to shut up about the things that bother him, fix those fucking problems.", "YTA. Your son can talk about whatever he wants in therapy. Therapy is for him to feel heard. Every therapist understands that their client\u2019s view is one-sided and will likely show bias (even if it is unintentional).

Neutrality is for the therapist. You commenting, is low key insecurity on your part; & shouldn't matter to you, because therapist's aren't social reporters for tabloids.\n\n2nd, parent or not, he's of adult age. He has every right to be angry, even if listening was accidental, & can verbally express his distress. That has NOTHING to do with you being a parent, because both of you are adults & can speak as such. You reacted, instead of acknowledging & reinforcing your remorse for overstepping - which unnecessarily escalated the conversation. Using language that's unsavory to you, may be perfect for his way of communicating his displeasure. Take it with a grain of salt, and not personally.\n\nIn hindsight, you do see your mistake. It would be exemplary for you NOW, as the parent, to ask him to have a calm conversation so you could genuinely apologize for mistakenly overhearing his session. Then, follow through with the conversation, and be a hero for your wife by \"saving Christmas\".\n\nUnderstand, that there may be a lot of baggage he needs to unpack in therapy; even if you can't fathom what his perspective is. If he has undiagnosed conditions, this is why he reacts so strongly & dramatically. You may be neurotypical, but he may not be - and that can be hard to deal with if he doesn't know how to identify his triggers, & have healthy coping mechanisms yet. Perhaps you investing time in understanding what (if anything) is causing his brain to work the way it does (atypical wiring, hormone imbalances, etc), can result in better communication, and a better & healthier relationship, in the long run.", "YTA.\n\nNot for accidentally hearing part of his conversation but for trying to dictate what your adult son tells his therapist.", "YTA to the biggest degree.

Of course YTA.\n\nYou majorly overstepped his boundaries, invaded his privacy, and judged and tried to control his interaction with the therapist whose role is to help him work through the very feelings you apparently think he has no right to express?   I'm sure he'll have plenty more to tell his therapist after this stunt.\n\nWow.", "Wow! Holy buckets of angry entitlement Batman!\n\nYTA - Your wife told you the proper response. You heard your kid so you know he's angry. What did you think would happen? \n\nI think you knew exactly what would happen and only care because your wife is angry with you now.\n\nI can't say if you're a bad parent or not. It seems that your kid is not afraid of going hungry or whether he can afford a roof over his head. He can get therapy which is more than a lot of people can do. Those things don't make you a great parent but they are a lot better than others have. If you want to classify your kid as an entitled shit, then do it.

It\u2019s nearly impossible for me to every think about myself without instantly downplaying my own experiences, a direct result of my mother\u2019s treatment toward me and why I found myself getting into abusive relationships with men. My therapist was so proud of me when I told a story from my childhood and instead of immediately going into excuse mode for something horrible my mother did to me, I just talked about my side. She told me that\u2019s a big step in recovery. The therapist isn\u2019t interested in hearing both sides in solo care. They\u2019re interested to see how your brain and emotions work and how to best treat your current emotional state.

I hope this has been a learning experience for you.\n\nETA- sorry forgot to put YTA", "YTA.  \n\nWhat your son discusses with his therapist, and how, is none of your g@%-damned business.  Only if the patient chooses to include you in the session or to confide in you afterwards are you or your wife in any kind of position to offer input. \n\nWhether you accidentally overheard his conversation is not important. Your reaction to it is.  You could have kept your mouth shut and let him have his privacy. You could have let him know that you heard him while staying completely neutral yourself. But no, you tried to force him to say what YOU wanted to hear. \n\nThe other commenters are right, you really DON'T understand how therapy works. And even though you're trying to 'apologize' now, I can certainly see why your son is getting therapy with parents like you.", "The whole point of therapy is that it\u2019s one sided. It\u2019s literally just your side of the story and how you feel about it. It\u2019s bad enough that you overheard, but to ask him to try to give fair and balanced reporting to his therapist so you won\u2019t look bad is just ridiculous. YTA", "YTA. Why do you feel the need to try to tell your son what to talk about with his therapist? You don't think a trained therapist knows how to assess their patient? You only get like an hour with a therapist and you want him to spend the time talking about the good things? Those aren't the things he's in therapy for, why would he waste time talking about them? And you don't think a therapist knows that they are getting a condensed version of things? You think the therapist believes their patient is fitting their whole life story into one hour? You just proved to your son that he is not safe in your home because his most private moments will be judged and picked apart by you. I don't blame him for leaving.", "lol", "YTA.\n\nYour kid's therapy sessions are his and his alone.  \n\nIf you're afraid of how you're portrayed in a retelling of a story, then perhaps you should've acted better.  \n\nBut instead of realizing that and acting accordingly, you blamed your son for his feelings about how you raised him?

The therapist is there to help him work through what his experiences are, and what he's feeling. \n\nHim censoring those emotions to give what YOU think is the situation with his therapist is not going to help him through what he's dealing with, and frankly it doesn't sound like he has any interest in doing that anyway.\n\nIf you continue pushing those boundaries, you're definitely going to be TA, and it sounds like your son is more than willing to make some distance between the two of you if he doesn't feel like you can respect his space.", "If you want to share your side then get your own therapist and paint yourself with kitties & rainbows all you want, you have ZERO say so in what your ADULT son says to his therapist.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIt's understandable that you would want to offer advice to your son and help him get the best treatment possible. However, it's important to remember that your son is an adult and has the right to make his own decisions about his healthcare and therapy. It's not appropriate to listen in on your son's therapy sessions, and it's not your place to tell him how to behave in therapy. Your suggestion to be neutral with his therapist may have come from a good place, but it's not your decision to make. It's important to respect your son's privacy and boundaries and let him handle his therapy as he sees fit. It's possible that you were in the wrong by overstepping your boundaries and offering unsolicited advice. It's important to apologize to your son and make amends if you want to repair your relationship and potentially salvage the holiday season.", "YTA.

The entire experience is about the person getting the therapy and how they feel/felt and whatever they went through from their point of view.  This is incredibly private.  Your wife was right that as soon as you learnt your son was in a therapy session you needed to not listen and respect that boundary, which clearly included discussing any part of it with him.  \nYou need therapy yourself and maybe with your son if you ever want to have a relationship with him again.

I'm not sure how you can fix this, and I really do mean this sincerely even though it's probably going to come across as snarky or whatever, but I would encourage you to talk to a therapist about what happened and hope they can help you figure out what you need to do to have a relationship with your son.

In point of fact, it's the sign of a bad therapist who aggressively urges their clients based off personal biases with some rare exceptions in the extreme. There is in fact a reason why different specialized therapists exist after all, such as those who help people explore their issues with their parents and decide whether to become estranged or not. Ultimately, a therapist should be helping an individual seek what's best for them, not passing judgement, or encouraging them to the benefit of people that aren't the client in question.\n\n>I had to bark back that he does not curse at us and he needs to respect us because we are his parents who have helped him get to where he is today, to which he just picked up his bowl and left the dinner table, going to his room.

And, as other people said in the comments, he can talk about you to his therapist any way he likes. That's healthy. The only thing that he shouldn't do is lie. I don't think he is. And just because he rants about the bad things doesn't mean he never talks about any good things.

He's not even attacking you directly but only your mouth, which you indeed shouldn't have opened. You're the one who should respect your son, not the other way around.

Among other things, they broke into my diary:  \"But you obvious subconsciously really wanted us to read it otherwise you wouldn't have left it somewhere we could find it.  You weren't fair to us at all in that diary!\"  They went on and on about how I wasn't nice to them, how they did everything for me and I didn't appreciate it, and so on.

He's property.\n\nAsk yourself why are you actually sorry.  Do you regret how your actions hurt your son or do you regret your wife being angry because it won't be the usual family Christmas without your son?

So, keep being a hard-headed Pollyanna and leave your son alone.", "Thank you for articulating this!

Now I have a cloth to clean them with.", "And the client-therapist relationship is PRIVATE \n\nOP, YTA for listening in and you're a giant, pussing AH for thinking you had a right to have an opinion about it.", "Yep! That was u/Current-Read but I cannot remember the post. I took a screenshot because it resonated with me. \n\n\u201cNTA, i have a saying \"If the truth about your conduct paints you in a bad light, the problem isn't with the truth. Its with your conduct.\" If the truth hurts your dad its his own to deal with and not on you.\u201d", "It was the post about the girl who did the power point highlighting her fathers abandonment and neglect then the family was mad because it made him sad. \n\nIt does fit here too, im happy OP's son is getting the therapy they need maybe OP should try it too"]}
