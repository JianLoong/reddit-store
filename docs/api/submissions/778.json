We went on a vacation with my sister, her husband, their 2 girls (14 and 12), and my brother, his wife, their 2 girls (15 and 13), and their son (20). \n\nThe house we booked has a huge bunkroom that all of the girls were going to sleep in. There were 2 bunk beds with trundle beds underneath and a single bed. Amelia is very sick and can't sleep on the top bunk because she has a hard time getting up and down the ladder. The trundles are also out of the question because she has a hard time standing up when she's that close to the ground. That leaves the bottom bunks and the single bed. I told my brother and sister that Amelia needs the bottom bunks or single bed. They both said that should be fine. \n\nWe got to the house and the girls ran to start calling their beds. Usually when we all travel somewhere, the girls choose their beds in order from oldest to youngest but I assumed my brother and sister talked to their kids about Amelia needing either the bottom bunk or single beds. Anyway, Amelia was left with a top bunk. \n\nShe came to tell me what happened so I went to talk to my daughters and nieces and see if anyone was willing to switch with Amelia. Everyone, including my daughters, said it's not a big deal, they've always chosen beds this way, and the top bunks aren't even that high up. I told Amelia she was going to sleep in the bedroom with me and my wife. She was upset about it but we told her it's better for her because she needs to sleep early and take naps anyway. \n\nShe went to play with her cousins and everything was okay the first day but on the second day, she ran to us crying because her cousins were teasing her for sleeping in her parents bed instead of the top bunk. We talked to them again but they brushed us off. Then I asked my older two why they didn't defend her but they said they didn't think it was a big deal and she's old enough to defend herself. Amelia clung to us for the rest of the day and was feeling miserable. We couldn't get her to play with her cousins so we decided to end the trip early and go home. \n\nMy older two were furious that we ended the trip early because she was \"too spoiled for the top bunk\" and \"couldn't handle a little teasing\". My brother and sister agree that she was acting a little spoiled and that I shouldn't have ruined the vacation for my older two because of her so now I'm wondering if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1667335838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjkxyg/aita_for_making_my_family_leave_our_vacation_early/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is it all on the kids to manage this while the adults sit on their hands? Your siblings assured you that they would help accommodate Amelia and didn't. You also failed to take care of this right away in a way that would allow Amelia to be better included by staying in the room with the other kids.\n\nAll of your kids - yours and your siblings' kids were allowed to be cruel to Amelia until you decided to dramatically end the vacation early.

It shouldn't have come to that. Your brother and sister also sound awful - they called a sick child \"spoiled\" instead of making sure she was protected and cared for? Yikes. \n\nI hope that you're not just letting this be. Both your kids will be blaming Amelia for the abrupt end to vacation and she'll suffer more.

Instead of taking Amelia to sleep in your room, you should have told the older girls: *one of you switches with Amelia now, or we're all going home... or no phone for a month, or whatever method of grounding you use*.\n\nIn the next family vacation, make the rules at home.
