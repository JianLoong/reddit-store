Our parents took Lily\u2019s phone away for two weeks instead of two days which I completely agree with because she lied to and basically publicly humiliated them.\n\nThe Katherine thing happened last month.

Lily got a recording of Beth bullying her in their class and showed it to our parents and the school.

She literally just lied to them about being bullied so she wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for ditching class. Obviously they wouldn\u2019t believe her when she claimed the same thing a few weeks later.\n\nLily accused me of victim-shaming her because she was bullied by Beth and our parents could have at least tried talking to the school.

When someone is clearly in their emotions, is it best to comfort first, and then have a more logical serious talk when they get out of that head space. Otherwise, it tends to do more damage than good. The logic part of the brain and the emotions part of the brain do not function in a coexisted way in most cases. And so when you do what you did, she will only get more emotional and hurt because ultimately... she is suffering. Doesn't matter is she deserves it or not. She is hurt, and has no one on her side. At school she gets bullied, at home her parents doesn't understand her or trust her.

These parents lost faith in their daughter at the very first lie of this Kind. They ideally should have told her, between the berating and the punishment for that first time, that they now no longer trust her with justifying ditching class with being bullied, so she'll have to Work harder to be taken seriously If there's an ACTUAL Problem, like by telling them proactively BEFORE ditching class.", "With a 14 year old who lied about the exact same thing a few weeks before?
