Our parents took Lily\u2019s phone away for two weeks instead of two days which I completely agree with because she lied to and basically publicly humiliated them.\n\nThe Katherine thing happened last month. So two weeks ago when Lily got in trouble for ditching class and told our parents it was because a girl named \u201cBeth\u201d was bullying her, our parents obviously didn\u2019t believe her and didn\u2019t try to talk to the school about it.\n\nIt turns Lily was actually telling the truth. Lily got a recording of Beth bullying her in their class and showed it to our parents and the school. The school ended up giving Beth detention and the teacher moved Beth\u2019s seat to the front so he could keep an eye on her.\n\nLily was telling me that our parents were the worst in the world and she hopes something bad happens to them so she can do nothing about it and they\u2019ll see how it feels.\n\nI told Lily that it\u2019s her own fault our parents did nothing about her being bullied by Beth. She literally just lied to them about being bullied so she wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for ditching class. Obviously they wouldn\u2019t believe her when she claimed the same thing a few weeks later.\n\nLily accused me of victim-shaming her because she was bullied by Beth and our parents could have at least tried talking to the school. I realize that Beth has the biggest fault in the bullying situation but I still think Lily needed to hear what I told her.
