My mom died when I was a few months old and my stepmom didn\u2019t want me in her house so I was raised by my grandparents, who passed away two years ago. My dad died before them so everything was willed to my half brother (28) and I. I inherited their house, almost everything in it, and all of my grandma\u2019s jewelry, which is worth about $750,000. I was also the sole beneficiary to their life insurance. My brother got a few heirlooms and some money but it was far less then what I got because he inherited a lot from our dad while I got pretty much nothing. \n\nAt the time, he didn\u2019t have a problem with it. He is getting married soon and I was talking to his fianc\u00e9e, who told me that my brother told her that our grandma wanted his future wife to get married wearing the jewelry she wore at her wedding. I have no idea why he told her this. He was not close to our grandma at all. She definitely did not promise him her wedding jewelry. I am actually planning on wearing it to my wedding and talked to my grandma about that. I told my SIL that I can\u2019t give her the jewelry. \n\nShe can borrow it for her wedding but she has to give it back because I plan on wearing it to my wedding too. She told me she doesn\u2019t want her sister in law to wear the same jewelry as her. I told her that I couldn\u2019t give her the jewelry and if my grandma wanted my brother\u2019s wife to have it then she would have willed it to him. I thought that was the end of it but it was not. \n\nMy brother called me that night and told me that his fianc\u00e9e was crying because of me and he deserved to have something from our grandma because I inherited a lot more than him. I reminded him that I grew up with my grandparents and had a much closer relationship with them. He cussed me out and said that I tricked them into leaving me most of their money. This isn\u2019t true. They raised me since I was a few months old and I went to a local university instead of my dream school so I would be able to stay home and care for them in their final years, so they obviously had a better relationship with me.\n\n I told him that his fianc\u00e9e can borrow the jewelry if she really wants to wear it to her wedding but I can\u2019t give it to her. His mom called me the next day and called me all sorts of nasty things for depriving my brother of something that my grandma promised to give him. If my grandma had actually promised him that, then I would have given him the jewelry. But I know she didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m not giving it to him.", "created_utc": 1690606595, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cjb8t/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_brother_and_sil_our/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd bet the farm, OP, that if you let them \"borrow\" the jewelry, it will somehow disappear, never to be found again.  \n\nYour stepbrother is very persistent and entitled.  Your grandmother wanted YOU to have it, OP. (I apologize for shouting - I hate to see young people being duped.)\n\nGet yourself a safety deposit box, OP, and put the jewelry in it until you have a safe house of your own.

You already got something. You don\u2019t deserve anything when someone passes, he should be thankful for what he got and move on. He\u2019s just mad you got more than him even though he inherited more from your dad. Death and dealing with inheritance really brings out the worst in some people (trust me, watching my boyfriends family deal with his grandparents estate has been a nightmare.)\n\nGet yourself a safe for your home if you don\u2019t have one already. Or open a safety deposit box. Either one, just keep the jewelry in one of those two locations for peace of mind. With how your brother and his fianc\u00e9e are acting, your offer of loaning her the jewelry should no longer be on the table. You had no obligation to even offer to let her wear any of what is now your jewelry. Even if it wasn\u2019t valuable, the sentimental value alone is worth so much more and the thought of her not returning it to you breaks my heart. Because she won\u2019t return it if she gets her fingers on any of it. Your brother will make sure of that.", "I agree with the other posters. Don\u2019t loan her the jewelry or you will never see it again.\n\nAdditionally, you should get it out of your house and into a safe deposit box or something similarly secure.\n\nThere was a post on here about a son who wanted to propose with his late mother\u2019s ring, but it had been left to his sister.

The jewelry is rightfully yours and has sentimental value to you.  She just wants it because it\u2019s worth money.", "Don\u2019t even let her borrow it. Your brother is willing to lie about what the dead said and intended. If you do let them borrow it, have witnesses, texts, written contract that it will be returned.

It will never be returned. \n\nHB and family are batshit. Put jewelry in a safety deposit box yesterday. Get at least one security camera (which I think is good advice regardless, but especially when you have unhinged people who feel completely entitled to your valuables).\n\nThink about getting the jewelry insured. $750,000.00 is more than a lot of houses, and you'd insure a house.", "Tell them to get stuffed . They are not entitled to anything.  They think they are, but thinking and being are 2 different things. You will never get anything you \n\" loan\" to her back again. Do not do it.", "NTA. Don't lend her the jewellery, not after her reaction when you said she could borrow them. Best case scenario, you'd have to involve the authorities to get them back.", "NTA Don\u2019t lend it to her. You will never get it back. Trust me. Your brother is an A of colossal proportions.

You\u2019d never see them again.\n\nBlock SIL and block your brother\u2019s mom. Only you can decide if you want to block your brother over this - perhaps see if he drops it or if he escalates.", "NTA, you said what you said, unfortunately this isn\u2019t going to go away anytime soon, but stand your ground. If you watch close enough you can actually witness the 7 stages of grief when a family member is unhappy with a will, its a little pathetic.", "NTA.  Make sure the jewelry is insured and keep it in a secure area like a safe deposit box or a floor safe in your house.  Do not let SIL/brother borrow your jewelry, they will never give it back.", "I wouldn\u2019t give her anything she could claim it as hers after you give it to her and say you gifted it to her", "I sincerely hope this jewelry is stored at a bank's vault and not in your house. I can see a \"home break in\" where that is all that is taken and the house ransacked to make it look like a break in. They know about the jewelry and feel entitled. They may take steps to get it.", "NTA, but you\u2019re kind of getting close to ESH\n\nThe compromise of \u201coh you can borrow my jewelry on your wedding day\u201d is a bit of a shitty proposition, especially if fianc\u00e9 earnestly believes bro\u2019s claims. Like what bride on earth wants to give up their wedding day jewelry? In the tone of your writing it seems like you have some deeper resentment towards your brother and are only extending the socially acceptable minimum of empathy to him. Which doesn\u2019t make you the asshole, but depending on you\u2019re handling some of these conversations, you could be getting a close.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it is your jewelry.
