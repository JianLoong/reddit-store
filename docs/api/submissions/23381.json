My mom died when I was a few months old and my stepmom didn\u2019t want me in her house so I was raised by my grandparents, who passed away two years ago. My dad died before them so everything was willed to my half brother (28) and I. I inherited their house, almost everything in it, and all of my grandma\u2019s jewelry, which is worth about $750,000. I was also the sole beneficiary to their life insurance. My brother got a few heirlooms and some money but it was far less then what I got because he inherited a lot from our dad while I got pretty much nothing. \n\nAt the time, he didn\u2019t have a problem with it. He is getting married soon and I was talking to his fianc\u00e9e, who told me that my brother told her that our grandma wanted his future wife to get married wearing the jewelry she wore at her wedding. I have no idea why he told her this. He was not close to our grandma at all. She definitely did not promise him her wedding jewelry. I am actually planning on wearing it to my wedding and talked to my grandma about that. I told my SIL that I can\u2019t give her the jewelry. \n\nShe can borrow it for her wedding but she has to give it back because I plan on wearing it to my wedding too. She told me she doesn\u2019t want her sister in law to wear the same jewelry as her. I told her that I couldn\u2019t give her the jewelry and if my grandma wanted my brother\u2019s wife to have it then she would have willed it to him. I thought that was the end of it but it was not. \n\nMy brother called me that night and told me that his fianc\u00e9e was crying because of me and he deserved to have something from our grandma because I inherited a lot more than him. I reminded him that I grew up with my grandparents and had a much closer relationship with them. He cussed me out and said that I tricked them into leaving me most of their money. This isn\u2019t true. They raised me since I was a few months old and I went to a local university instead of my dream school so I would be able to stay home and care for them in their final years, so they obviously had a better relationship with me.\n\n I told him that his fianc\u00e9e can borrow the jewelry if she really wants to wear it to her wedding but I can\u2019t give it to her. His mom called me the next day and called me all sorts of nasty things for depriving my brother of something that my grandma promised to give him. If my grandma had actually promised him that, then I would have given him the jewelry.

Like what bride on earth wants to give up their wedding day jewelry? In the tone of your writing it seems like you have some deeper resentment towards your brother and are only extending the socially acceptable minimum of empathy to him.
