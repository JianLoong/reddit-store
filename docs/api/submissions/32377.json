In this case, they aren't A H either.\nIf I had to pick a possible guardian for my future child, them being able to afford a good life for the child would 100% be a factor in the decision. Not the only factor, but certainly a factor. I'm guessing this was the case, since she didn't hide it from you. Be honored, they liked you and knew you would be generous enough to share with their child if anything happened. Neither factor is an insult.", "In my family, my mum decided my godmother (her friend) would be because they had wanted a child but couldn't and they were a married couple and wanted me to be raised in a two parent household.\n\nWhatever the reason is it can be hard to hear because you have to make a decision between people. Financially stable will always play a factor as kids are not cheap. \n\nThey didn't need to tell you the reason though, at least not that way. They could say all the reasons (although if the only reason is money then they arw the AH).\n\nI'm more concermed by the statement saying if they ask for money then you give them money. Thats more of a red flag to me. None of my friends ever ask for money. I might offer if theybare having a rough time but most of the time they would say no. I think if they ask you for money next time then maybe say I can't at the moment.

And that, as a parent, ought to be the main thing. Better life in a trailer park on welfare with a godmother who loves Sunshine than a cold life in the richest house in the world.\n\nWhat you want to know is, do your friends see it that way? Would they have picked you for Sunshine if you were disinherited, broke, and on welfare, because you love her and would do your utmost to look after her? Did they pick you because you have a loving heart or because you have deep pockets? If their motivation was mainly your money, and they didn't know for sure you'd love Sunshine at all, then yes, they are AHs and you are not wrong to be angry. \n\nTo a certain extent, it doesn't matter now. Your main relationship here is to Sunshine, not to her parents.   \n\n\nNTA.

You said you'd take her, but now you're mad it's about money. And they'd leave their kid with someone who they know doesn't want a kid, just for mercenary reasons. It's gross. But why else would they leave their kid to someone who has tons of money and doesn't want kids, except to guarantee their kid gets that money.~~\n\nI don't like \"tests\", but it's time to see where you stand.

Money. \n\nI was really pissed when I found out it was someone in the family who was wealthy but didn't look after them as much as we do. Their reason was that they wanted to have them be the priority in their lives like they are to them and they would be able to do all the things they want to with the other person, where as with us it would be a loving home 100% however it would be a completely different life to the way they have been living (they will be one of many kids vs being the VIPs).\n\n\nAnyways.

I can understand why they might have that as a private reason for picking you (along with the fact they think you\u2019d do a good job) but to tell you to your face that\u2019s the only reason isn\u2019t nice at all.", "NTA. Why would you want to be legal guardian it you never wanted kids though?", "I don't think you the AH but as a parent that is a large factor in deciding who would take care of your kids if you weren't able to. I asked my cousin to be my son's godmother only after asking her if she felt financially stable enough to care for a child on her own - she was single then is now married. It was a huge factor for me because I also have two sisters who love my kids like their own but wouldn't be able to provide for him as well as my cousin would. Just want you to see it from the viewpoint of a parent.", "They saw an opportunity and took it, I hope they have other factors too not only money. \nWhat If they mentioned something about you not having someone to inherit since you don't want kids. \ud83e\udd14 I wish you knew the whole conversation, I hope that's not the case.

It rarely occurs but they always have the opportunity to be a separate, positive influence on the child\u2019s life. \n\nWhat your friend said sounds shitty and poorly stated. But from your other comment it sounds like that may have been the deciding factor but not why you were in the running to begin with. They wouldn\u2019t want someone that they didn\u2019t have really strong positive feelings about to have this role for their child. The fact that you don\u2019t hold this against sunshine proves you were the right call. \n\nFeel those feelings but look at the bright side that they never would have considered you if they didn\u2019t respect the hell out of you.", "honestly? that is a completely valid, legitimate, and even good, reason to pick you as a Godmother. NAH.", "I don\u2019t know, it sounds like they picked the person who they thought would be able to care for their child the best, if they were no longer around.  If other friends had or were intending to have children, they maybe figured that their daughter would miss out, both financially and attention wise.  \n\nEdit.   After reading some of your comments, it does seem strange to tell in this way.  Sorry, I can see why you are hurt.", "Regardless of the reason they chose you...what parent would want the legal guardian of their kids to be someone with money. But you were a fool to agree to this anyway because you don't want kids. So for me, this makes you the AH for agreeing to be a godmother and legal guardian in the first place", "Would it be different if she said first because you are a wonderful person and she can be sure you would care a lot? And then: plus I know you can also actually afford it to take care for a child? Because I personally feel that would have been way better? - anyway NTA", "NAH\n\nThis is not about themselfs (they obbiously like you for you) but about their most precious \"possesion\", their child. \n\nIF the child would lose both their parents, they want at least make sure the child gets all the chances in life while still having a reliable person to raise them. I think thats fair. I doubt you would be a godparent if you wern't friends and you were the town-villain. ;)", "Is there a \"Nobody's the Asshole\" option?\n\nI don't think you're an asshole. I also don't think there's anything to be mad about. \n\nThe #1 responsibility of a parent is to care for their children. Your friends concluded that of everyone they knew, you'd give Sunshine the best life without them. Regardless of the reason, that means they are morally obliged to ask you first, for the good of their child. \n\nAnd they were right. Your friends thought that you would make Sunshine's life better, and you DO make it better. If you were a rich asshole, your friends would not have trusted you with their child's welfare.\n\nSo please, for everyone's sake, let it go. You're CLEARLY NTA. Sunshine's parents aren't either.", "NTA.  It sounds like these friends have some issues with both boundaries and communication, and I think anyone would be pissed in your shoes.  But on some level they also knew you are kind and have thoughtful (shown here, for example, in your ability to separate out/discern the \u201csins of the mother\u201d from the child, and also in your altruistic willingness to take a kid even though it\u2019s not your own desired life path) \u2014 even if the mother is boneheaded enough to say it\u2019s all about the cash.\n\nAll that said, if you really don\u2019t want to raise a kid, maybe they should find a plan B?", "NAH. If I understand it correctly, they choose between her sister with 3 kids and you. It seems that both you and her sister are good people and love Sunshine. But since she already has 3 kids, adding another child could be a financial burden to her. So your financial stability and ability to provide a kid with a good home, including things that money can buy - better education, extracurricular activities, hobbies etc, realistically speaking, is important factor.", "NTA. But honestly as a parent, they must have chosen you because they think you\u2019d do the job well. It probably came down to several people and your wealth inched you ahead of others. But no sane parent is going to leave their kid to an inappropriate guardian just because they are wealthy. \n\nI do think you need to establish better boundaries. Buying a car for friends and acting like their bank is nice but kind of inappropriate. Just adds an odd dynamic to the relationship. It\u2019s not your job to bail out friends financially just because you can.", "There are worse reasons. NAH", "NTA to feel this way but I\u2019m surprised if you never wanted children that you would accept to be a legal guardian.\n\nI would have thought that not wanting children would also mean not wanting to be the guardian of someone else\u2019s child as it means that you could end up being a parent (something you don\u2019t want).", "INFO: did they say outright \u201cit has nothing to do with you being a good fit and is all about the money\u201d? \n\nI come from a pretty privileged upbringing and I think you\u2019re likely being too sensitive. Of course Sunshine\u2019s parents want her to go somewhere financially stable. Maybe they had a couple people in mind that they love and trust with Sunshine, but you\u2019re the only one they feel has the financial means to make sure she\u2019s adequately taken care of and that it wouldn\u2019t be overly burdensome to ask of you. I don\u2019t see why that would piss you off - it\u2019s their job as her parents to ensure she goes to the best home if anything happens to them, and the reality is that a friend they trust and love with a strong financial position is probably a better option than someone who is struggling financially.", "I mean, that's partly why my sister is my daughter's god parent. Granted it's not the *only* reason. She loves and cares for my daughter, she's a post partum doula so caring for kids is literally her profession but she never wants to have her own kids and she and her husband do extremely well financially. I had considered giving the roll to my husband's sibling or even my best friend but while they're not struggling I know a kid would be a lot on their plate. If anything ever happened to my husband and I I'd know that my kid would be in good hands and given every opportunity with my sister.\n\nOf course this means nothing as God parents aren't actually legally recognized from what I understand. We're kinda just shouting into the void when we give someone the title. Lol", "NAH I think you took this poorly and are sensitive on the topic.  It looks like they valued you and the sister equally if they were thinking about you both and you were picked as you could afford this.  That is not picking you solely because you have money.  To me that reads as they think as highly of you as one of their own family.", "Well, why didn\u2019t you think about that reason years off? Seems pretty obvious then as it sounds now given the circumstances. And if you are a good Godmother, you would anyways do what\u2019s right for Sunshine, whether legal guardian or not. So feel honored that they formalized it. I guess you agreed to it then? YTA for feeling surprised. They don\u2019t ask you for cash now, do they?", "Ok, so it looks like I'm going against the grain but YTA. \n\n1. You seem ready to believe that if your money is even remotely mentioned then it obviously means that people are only dealing with you for your money and while I definitely believe that has happened, I do think you need to learn when people are doing that and it doesn't seem like your BF is.\n2. I don't ever plan on having children, but if I did I would absolutely pick the person that not only has morals and values that align with how I want my kid raised but that would also have the means too and if I was struggling between 2 different people, i would again pick the one that has more money/time/etc. How I would see it, it's bad enough my kids lost their parents at a young age and will struggle with that for a long time, I also wouldn't want them to have to struggle with resources and time as well (also, and this is a ME thing, but if I choose the person that actually has money there is less chance that my children's inheritance would be used for other things instead of either being used strictly for them or making a nice nest egg for them)\n3. I don't know your friend, but seeing as how you didn't indicate she's like a gold digger friend, I'm assuming #2 went through her head and she told you the reason why you won, your financially stability, which again, doesn't mean she's a gold digger, it means (at least to me, and I don't know her, so only you will know if what I'm about to say makes sense) he was just telling you the winning reason and because she hasn't acted like a gold digger, she didn't think you'd take offense.

In that state of grief, I need to know that whoever has them can step up and lead them through it.

I talked with my friends about it.   You have the right to know what you would need to handle if they pass.  \n\nAlso if the kid goes from an only child to surrounded by other kids that have their parents, then the kid will not handle it well.

Most people understand that means they'll get guardianship if something happens.  \n\nYou agreed to this.", "OP seems to care about the child. People tend to step upp when something horrible happens.", "She did more than botch the delivery. OP says in another comment that after this happened she stopped giving them money monthly. The friend then called her a bitch and ungrateful. I would say that the parents are not friends of OP. They're friends of her money.", "They considered, and made, someone who NEVER wanted kids their daughter\u2019s potential future guardian because she has money. Do people not see how wrong that is?", "her sister has more than enough money (even back then). It's just I have (a lot) more. \ud83d\ude29", "Not always true, a friend said they would rather have Charles Manson raise their kids rather than her sister.  Plus quite frankly we do not know how many friends the parents had to choose from to raise the kid.  Maybe they were the only 2 people in the running.", "If her goal was to provide future financial stability for her daughter in the case of her and her husband\u2019s death, she blew it! I mean, she held it together for 7 years. Something maybe happened behind the scenes. Her husband said something flattering about you and she\u2019s jealous? Or he a crush on you? Or \u2026??? (Insert endless possibilities)", "Then she could have said no. Isn't there a ceremony when the kid gets baptized.", "What? Godmothers legal guardians? Since when???? What happened to siblings, cousins, aunts etc etc? \n\nMost kids never even meet their godparents to begin with.", "I very much doubt they TOLD her she had this role. Picked here means they chose to ASK her.\n\nIf they literally called her and informed her that she will be filling that role, then they are huge fucking assholes. Not at all because of the money thing, but because they forced a role like that on somebody.", "Why be a godmother if you are not willing to care for a kid in the worst case? You miss the point.", "Or they are just really close friends. Like most people are that chose to ask somebody to be their godparent.\nWhy are you so bitter?", "That is really really really wierd and not OK. What the F!\nThat should be what you are pissed about.", "Its good that you're up for helping your friends, Its a slippery slope though. If roles were flipped would they do it for you?", "And now that they do know you are rich, it\u2019s changed. Them making you their godmother is only the first step, watch them ask you for everything child related, and make their child ask you for handouts too.", "And that is exemplary of you! But they need to be grateful themselves. You helping with their kid is NOT a \"given\", it is a MASSIVE bonus that they should not just expect to be handed to them. \n\nIf you needed help, would they be there for you? To what extent?", "Not sure about the law where you are. \n\nIt can mean they believe putting in their will makes it bending for you. \n\nWhere I am that would only means, if both parents were to die, you will be the first one asked to take guardianship. \nHowever you would still be in your right to either accept or reject the guardianship of the kid. Then others are asked until reaching the point of states placement. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t yourself agreed by contract consent taking legal guardianship, they don\u2019t have a leg to stand, and only finally showed their greedy side. \nBest to check with a lawyer. You never know the extent of a conning.", "Being a godparent and a legal guardian are two different things in most countries. When we made our wills we had discussed with friends that we would want them to raise our children if something happened to us. They asked the same of us.   \n\n\nOur lawyer stressed to us that putting it in a will doesn\u2019t legally obligate our friends.", "That is so rude!! So you are not allowed to have any feelings about this?! \n\n\nI didn't realise it go so heated. I would distance yourself, tell sunshine that they can see you whenever they want (so they know it has nothing to do with them). \n\n\nYou didn't ask for this level of commitment. Also, if you haven't signed anything...  that means there isn't anything legally binding me.... otherwise Elon Musk would be the legal guardian to a lot of children over the world \ud83e\udd23\n\n\nMaybe start checking over your monthly payment plans too with the other children you are supporting... I really find that quite odd that this is being expected of you (I say that because of the outburst you recently got handed)...", "NTA.  So this response here tells me everything you need to know about your \u201cfriends\u201d.  Sure they probably thought you were a decent person when they asked, but your money guaranteed it.  The sister thing, I feel like was one of those throw out answers when someone is cornered in a conversation.  \u201cYou did this\u201d and their response is typically \u201cYeah, but so and so did that\u201d.  I\u2019m a Godfather a couple times over myself and my best friend has repeatedly said \u201cIf I died, I know my kids would be taken care of\u201d when talking to me.  My buddy\u2019s wife told their entire family at dinner \u201cI always wanted my children to have an Uncle that was wild, but absolutely adored them\u201d again referring to me.  I can\u2019t imagine if I were to find out that I\u2019m only their Godfather because I\u2019m financially stable.  Sorry this happened to you.", "There are people in the US that use those words backwards. My BF is from MT & swears that\u2019s how he was taught & his other two siblings use them wrong too. His mom used them correctly. It drives me crazy.", "Thanks", "Their lawyer is clearly a bit of an idiot and dodgy, because they cannot make you a legal guardian without your consent. So I wouldn't worry about it. Worse  case scenario both parents die, you are under no legal obligation to take this child", "It means you'll be the first one turned to for claiming the kid.  The kid isn't forced on you.  You can refuse.  Then they turn to next of kin.  \n\nYou're acting like this is the end of the world.  Your lawyer should have explained this to you but it seems like they want to milk the hours off you.", "They can suggest that. A court would need to confirm that - and be sure, they won\u2019t against your will. Save yourself the lawyer\u2019s fees\u2026", "I don't think so. It's not the first time I hosted a party. And not just for the little one.", "How can one make a legal guardian without the permission or some sort of signature of that person? OP insinuates that this is so. That way Musk and Bezos would be inundated with legal guardianship of lots of children", "I do agree it was rudely worded and they are being butts now to call you ungrateful for an honor that is really a sacrifice, but also agree with this commenter.\n\nI am in the same boat, but bff explained better. Her sisters have kids and I don't, so her little buddy would not have to compete with other kids for resources and attention in a situation where he would be grieving and traumatized. She wasn't saying I'd be a bad guardian in other ways, just that she felt also in that awful scenario, buddy's best shot was with me.\n\nThat said, it's ok to be hurt. Feel what you feel, and if your friends expected you'd be more involved outside of the worst that's on them.", "The best interest of the child is NOT giving it to someone who NEVER wanted kids just because they have money ffs.", "Guardianship, yes. Godparentship, not really, because it's more about the baptismal ceremony that any real duties going forward.", "[deleted]", "No. I didn't; here in my country these two things are two different things.  \n\n\nGodmother here is like being an extra aunt, legal guardian is being the legal guardian.", "That is true.", "Oh that\u2019s awful.", "From all your posts it is clear your \"friends\" are with you because of your wealth.  She did not want to burden her sister with another child but had no problem with completing up ending your life if something bad happened.  She did not care that you are child free by choice.  She picked your money for her child.  If I were in your situation I would distance myself from Sunshine's parents, they have been using their child to emotionally manipulate you.  I am so sorry people can be so greedy and terrible.  The best teacher I ever had told our class \"in life you will be lucky to have one true friend, most people in your life are only acquaintances\".  35 years ago that sounded harsh, sadly it has proven true.  Good luck to you", "Then it's on you to decide if you believe they keep you around only for money or not.", "Let's put it this way. In not dysfunctional families, aunts and uncles come before friends when it comes to their closeness to the child.", "Please read what I said:\n\nThe original idea of godparents is to promise to take care of the kid if parents can't for example if they pass. \n\nIt is not legally binding but it is what you promise before the parents and god. So wether you are officially made the guardian or not is basically just a formality.\n\nAlso there is nothing to prevent family members to become godparents. \n\nThat's why in my country it's a tradition for godparents to gift the child a spoon. It means whatever happens the child will always have a place at their table if they need to because the parents can't care for them or feed them.", "they did. They informed me, that I am the legal guardian.", "because here being the godmother is like being to cool aunt. Not the legal guardian. This are two different things.", "I hope it would be, but I'm not sure atm", "I don't know the other families well. I came in contact with them over organisations, people who know people yada yada yada ..  \n\n\nThe only one I know well, are sunshine's parents. We are friends for over 10 years.   \n\n\nI hope they would be there for me.", "If my lawyer milk the hours off me or not is my thing.", "she's looking into it now anyway, so no biggie.", "You can name a guardian for your kid or kids, but the person does not have to accept the responsibility. The named guardian has the right to decline.", "People who never wanted kids can still be good parents when it comes down to it.  It sounds like OP agreed that if she had to, she would do her best to look after the kid.", "Ohhh true.", "being the **GODMOTHER** or being the **LEGAL GUARDIAN** is a difference. Godmother is like being in some cases an extra aunt, a person where the kid can go to, to asks things whatever - thats not being a mother.", "Yeah they're legally two things (thus the paperwork), but typically they're the same person and it's the colloquial way of asking someone to be legal guardian.  \n\nThat's the same question my best friend asked me for her kid.  I understood the implication.", "I was raised Lutheran and when I was baptized the godparents agreed to take responsibility for my religious education and to give me a home if my parents died.  The pastor said this and they agreed.  Of course this was around 40-50 years ago.", "I read exactly what you wrote. \n\nThat's why I answered by saying that most kids never even meet the Godparents. I am a godmother and by no means would that make my cousin pick me as a legal guardian. \n\nWhat you say,  is practically never done and you cannot use it as a way to basically say that someone \"must\" be a legal guardian should something happen to the parents of a child. You wouldn't even have a legal reason to back you up in such a case", "They didn't ask? What the fuck?\nThat is the oddest thing I have ever heard, and should have been the question here.", "Are you legally obligated then? I hope not. Get out of that asap and remove yourself from their lives. They just sound like mooches using their daughter to get to you. NTA", "no here they aren't the same person. 1 out of 10 people maybe. But most of the time it's two different people, and you ask them if they want to be godmother **and** then you ask the same person or someone else to be the legal guardian. And they know that, it wasn't implicated or so.", "Exactly that's what I mean. Of course noone can force you but it's the promise you make.", "Then you need to read again.\n\nI explained what being godparents means in the eyes of the church and that while most don't connect it to the legal guardianships that's still what it's supposed to be if the sad case happens. \n\nI never said someone must be a legal guardian. I said being willing to become one is the promise you make by becoming a godparent. So it's NOT exactly what I said. \n\nThe idea of godparents comes from a time long before legal guardianships like that existed and its more like an honor thing you are not forced to follow but promise to.\n\nAlso little thought: Just because something is never done to your knowledge where you live doesn't mean that applies to the whole world.", "Question, have you signed anything making you legal guardian? Country laws vary, but I cannot imagine any nation would allow someone to make another person legal guardian of a child without their consent.", "Unless it's in a will, or custody papers are drawn up,being  godparent isn't legally binding.", "Just because something happens in your imagination, doesn't mean it happens to the rest of the world\n\nThere are various vows given in various mysteries. This isn't a valid reason\n\nyou just repeat the same and the same, trying to justify the fact that OP was blindsided, so it's pointless", "I never claimed it was. I said that's what you promise without legal binding but you should be willing to do it imo before becoming a godparent as that is the whole point of it originally. So why would it come as a shock that the parents would actually expect you to keep the promise. It's not just a fancy title.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAlright. I can't help you if you don't know the origin or definition of godparents. And if you claim to know every cultural tradition around the world. And know thisnis not how it is done where I am from (that you don't know where that is). Maybe not just sleep in church during the next baptism. \n\nYou are a funny ignorant one.\n\nAnd btw OP was not blindsighted about the guardianship but about the reason she was chosen. You failed to correctly read that as well."]}
