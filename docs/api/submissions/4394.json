If telling them has no effect, you have to walk out. And you have to make very very clear why. If it happens again, walk our and disengage from family events.

Your parents need to step in and explain to your family that you have a medical reason for being so small.", "NTA, I have a similar situation that makes me lose and gain weight so I have a variation of clothes.

It was a losing battle. \n\nI think a lot of people don't understand the way these kind of issues impact a body. They can't comprehend that just because they struggle NOT to gain weight doesn't mean that everyone's bodies work the same way. \n\nBut that's no excuse to be rude and hurtful. \n\nYour aunt was supposed to give you a gift. She did not do that. \n\nShe hurt you and she owes you an apology--and a real gift. \n\nNTA.", "Even if you HAD an ED, what she did was ABSOLUTELY not ok. Shaming people for their disorders and doing things like this is incredibly and unbelievably cruel. NTA at all, I would\u2019ve done the same thing. Skinny shaming is a (less common, but) very real thing and people don\u2019t realize how harmful this behavior can be on someone. Thankfully you seem to take it well mentally, but god your family is awful.", "I would get some proof from your doctor about the colitis and then send an article about the weight problems along with the diagnosis. Someone on here dekebasswood said \u2018You were expecting to open a present. Instead you opened up a judgement.\u2019 Use that. Tell them you eat well but can\u2019t gain wait and didn\u2019t expect one of your favourite people to judge you in front of your whole family. I\u2019m so sorry she did that to you.\n\nI have a niece who is a 00. She doesn\u2019t have any Illness. She eats way more than I do she just can\u2019t gain weight. Without proof, without the context of sudden, inexplicable weight loss, people shouldn\u2019t be making these assumptions.", "Oh this is good. OP opened a judgement instead of a gift. Merry Christmas OP. Hope Santa brought you a lamp holder to go with that shade!\n\nNTA", "Apart from being insensitive to OP's medical condition, self-improvement gifts are never nice if they weren't asked for.", "Yea, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m trashy like everyone else is saying I am.

What she did is rude as hell on its face.

I have UC, was diagnosed at 14 and the struggle to gain weight is real. People in high school constantly asked if I was anorexic. It was really frustrating. Even my doctors who knew about my condition gave me lectures on my weight. I\u2019m sorry your family isn\u2019t giving you the support you need. NTA of course.\n\nI hope it gets better for you. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s now and have a ileostomy and have never felt better. I hope you find the right treatment plan for you. Wishing you the best. And if you haven\u2019t checked them out yet, there is a UC/Crohns community on Reddit. It can be really helpful sometimes to rant over there.", "NTA\n\nDid you take the clothes?

She had been harassing me for months I went to the school they did absolutely nothing, she even went so far as to say I paid her boyfriend to sleep with him. So I kicked her ass \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f n the dog poop thing I exaggerated. It didn\u2019t get in her mouth n it wasn\u2019t fresh I just added that for the story value.", "N that was the only time i was arrested, because she had been bullying me and harassing me for months. She ruined my reputation. I never did anything to her. And my parents think she deserved it for being a asshole, so honestly you didn\u2019t go through months of bullying and being harassed so you have no room to judge me", "I got diagnosed when I was five, so I\u2019ve had it for as long as I could remember so I\u2019m kinda used to the pain.

And also I\u2019ve gotten a lot better with punctuation and using paragraphs because of you guys. Just because ur life is boring and you couldn\u2019t even fathom someone not having a boring uneventful life doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have a chaotic life \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so literally just block my acct if you really have a problem with me", "NTA, your Aunt is awful.", "NTA You are right. She is a dick.", "Your aunt was coming from a place of nastiness. Even if you had ED there's no reason to shame you like that; since you don't, it's abusive.", "NTA, your family members that treat you like this are all jerks.", "NTA there's this scene in the movie spanglish when the mother bought small sizes clothes to her daughter to \"help her\" loose weight, it's the same thing it's just a dick move", "NTA It's just as bad as giving clothes several sizes smaller to someone to encourage them to lose weight. I don't know if it was out of love or malice, just that it was inappropriate. I wonder why after you told her what size you wore; she didn't buy that size. To do what she did makes me lean to thinking it was done out of malice.", "NTA\n\nI would've done the same thing. \n\nShe's an ah for what she did. You have a health condition that she doesn't understand and it's easier for her to blame it on an eating disorder. \n\nIf you were overweight, would she buy you clothes 5 sizes too small to encourage you to lose weight?  \n\nShe sounds manipulative and your family isn't supportive.", "NTA the parents are really ignoring this even tho they know your have a disorder \nSorry forgot how to spell it", "NTA. When it honestly is something you don\u2019t like you and you know they tried, you smile thank them, and chuck it in the closet.

What about in 20 years?", "Wait a second... I'm here defending OP's demented 15yo honor. But  I didn't see any dog poop post! Currently I unearthed six posts over the last two months.

It's not ok though and your family needs to get that through their skull. \n\nA dear friend of mine also suffered from colitis until she had the problem part surgically removed. Even now she still has her lingering problems, so I can imagine what you're going through. It's hard and definitely not by choice. They might've thought they were supportive but were in fact doing the opposite. I'm sorry you have to deal with that crap. \nWishing you all the best and that your health may improve so you can get to the weight you want.

She sounds cruel and you don't deserve that OP", "Even if you were starving yourself, how THE FUCK is a larger dress going to help? Like dude she wasn\u2019t doing it because she was concerned. She was doing it to be judgmental and rude. Defo NTA", "Nta\nSpeaking as someone who actually does have a history of an eating disorder if a family member had done that to me whilst I was at my most sick  I would have been incredibly triggered and it would have made my ED worse. It\u2019s an incredibly rude and harmful thing to do. It\u2019s not something someone does out of concern, it\u2019s a malicious act and it was meant to make you feel badly about yourself."]}
