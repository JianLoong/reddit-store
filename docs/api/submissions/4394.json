Focus on staying as healthy as you can with nutrients/and vitamins according to your doctors orders. \n\nSo walking out after your Aunt, who claims she is close to you,  did that is 100% justified.

If telling them has no effect, you have to walk out. And you have to make very very clear why. If it happens again, walk our and disengage from family events.

Your parents need to step in and explain to your family that you have a medical reason for being so small.", "NTA, I have a similar situation that makes me lose and gain weight so I have a variation of clothes.
