She was like this as a child and it left her parents with major insecurities as they felt they couldn't make their own kid happy, but literally nothing made her happy. Cold is really the best word for it.\n\nA few years ago MIL met \"Blake\" and they began dating. He can actually make her happy and I think her parents are a bit jealous. It's honestly very jarring to see her show any emotion but hey good for her. Last year I invited my husband's whole family over for Christmas. My baby was sleeping upstairs. \n\nMIL has always hated Christmas because she doesn't want to give certain people gifts, gets mad when she is given gifts, becomes depressed if she doesn't get any, and claims she feels bullied into buying gifts for people she doesn't like (me lol) Normally she just glares at her gift and mutters thank you.\n\nWell Blake gave her a gift and she screamed, like a real scream loud enough to wake the baby and jumped on him. I don't actually know what it was, tickets to something I think, but my baby immidiatley started crying. i was annoyed and snapped at MIL that she was inconsiderate. MIL said all I ever care about is my baby and I'm ruining Christmas. That pissed me off so I kicked her out.\n\nMILs parents got mad and said I should have let it go. They've never seen their daughter happy and it was sweet. I got mad and said their daughter does not come before my infant son. Well tomorrow is christmas and I've decided MIL can't come unless she apologizes for waking the baby and disrespecting me. She is refusing and says she didn't mean to scream and I'm crazy and overreacting. She is currently not invited and I'm getting a lot of shit from the rest of the family.

You've had an entire year to approach this situation, yet you've waited until now? Also... babies wake up. It's a normal thing. Waking a baby up can be an inconvenience but it isn't the end of the world. She screamed with excitement. She didn't scream AT your baby, nor abuse the child.

What did your husband say regarding all of this?\n\nNTA if my assumption of this being the continuation of a pattern for MIL that needs addressed.
