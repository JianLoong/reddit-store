Cold is really the best word for it.\n\nA few years ago MIL met \"Blake\" and they began dating. He can actually make her happy and I think her parents are a bit jealous. It's honestly very jarring to see her show any emotion but hey good for her. Last year I invited my husband's whole family over for Christmas. My baby was sleeping upstairs. \n\nMIL has always hated Christmas because she doesn't want to give certain people gifts, gets mad when she is given gifts, becomes depressed if she doesn't get any, and claims she feels bullied into buying gifts for people she doesn't like (me lol) Normally she just glares at her gift and mutters thank you.\n\nWell Blake gave her a gift and she screamed, like a real scream loud enough to wake the baby and jumped on him. I don't actually know what it was, tickets to something I think, but my baby immidiatley started crying. i was annoyed and snapped at MIL that she was inconsiderate. MIL said all I ever care about is my baby and I'm ruining Christmas. That pissed me off so I kicked her out.\n\nMILs parents got mad and said I should have let it go. They've never seen their daughter happy and it was sweet. I got mad and said their daughter does not come before my infant son. Well tomorrow is christmas and I've decided MIL can't come unless she apologizes for waking the baby and disrespecting me. She is refusing and says she didn't mean to scream and I'm crazy and overreacting. She is currently not invited and I'm getting a lot of shit from the rest of the family.

It's not the end of the world.", "Wow.  \n\nPoor lady as some mental health issues (that don\u2019t hurt anyone) dating back to childhood.  \n\nShe reacted with overzealous happiness for a few seconds and you jump down her throat?", "YTA. You gave your MIL this whole background story where she is cold and heartless. That has nothing to do with the actual situation. You don't like her so you took a simple situation (a guest being too loud at your Christmas party) and turned it into a year long grudge.", "YTA a reaction of joy . . . You are mad about someone else being happy . . . Narcissist much? Absolutely YTA! \n\nA simple chat about the baby sleeping would have been enough. You owe her an apology for jumping down her throat like a child throwing a tantrum.", "Overblown. YTA.", "YTA, you held a grudge for that long? Over something so small? Apologize to your MIL", "ah, MiL Troll\n\nso pathetic", "YTA, your MIL was happy and showed it. Get over it.", "YTA", "You are such a loser. Of course you\u2019re the a.", "YTA. This post is crazy. You're a crazy person. She screamed out of joy and excitement. Again, you're fucking crazy. Get over it.", "YTA. If you cancel everyone who wakes your baby or who you perceive has done him wrong, you\u2019ll be all by yourself in no time-which might be a good thing", "YTA. If you are concerned about noise and your child\u2019s sleep schedule then here\u2019s a crazy idea: DON\u2019T INVITE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OVER FOR CHRISTMAS. \n\nPeople should be conscious of noise in other people\u2019s homes but it\u2019s ridiculous to have a get together with a bunch of people, for Christmas no less, and then boohoo over noise not being at infant-perfect levels.", "Christ I misread this and thought this happened today on Christmas Eve and she didn\u2019t want to invite her tomorrow. A whole year??? Yea TA for sure", "I like how she complains about MIL showing not enough and too much emotion in the same post.", "Agree. That's ridiculous.", "It was the second sentence you wrote.  If her parents feel this way, they need therapy before being allowed another child.", "What is the MIL troll people are referring to, I can\u2019t comprehend the meaning", "Some people, sure. But OP literally began her post by complaining that the women in question is cold, reserved, and doesn't display enough positive emotions.", "Who in your life made you believe you\u2019re not allowed to express your joy fully?", "YTA. Apologize to your MIL and hope that no one mentions it again.", "My God. Someone who's been reserved and is starting to come out of her shell felt safe enough to share her emotions and got punishment for it. YTA.", "YTA\nSounds like you took relish in her misery.", "Facts- she wont spend it alone she has her bf.  You sound bitter.", "YTA.  Kinda can see why she isn\u2019t excited to buy you gifts.", "YTA. You held onto this for an entire year and uninvited her days before the holiday? And all this because she was happy about getting a gift and spontaneously exclaimed?\n\nGee, can\u2019t imagine why your MIL doesn\u2019t like you.", "You kicked her out instead of calming down and revisting the topic later. You both could have handled this last Christmas like adults. But you just kicked her out on Christmas because she accidentally woke up your kid? Yta.", "Sounds like you guys have beef and your looking for any way to make her feel like crap, it\u2019s Christmas. Stop trying to hide behind \u201cI\u2019m just being a good mother\u201d it\u2019s not going to work. Holidays are loud and babies get woken up, that\u2019s life. You and this person clearly have an issue your post is seething with vitriol. YTA. Edit to add: and your comments really make you look like a pathetic individual, I feel bad for your partner..", "YTA: First, you're upset that she's \"cold\" and then you're upset that she's showing a spontaneous emotion for a gift given by her new husband. Alright, there are a few things at play here- Why would you all have a gift exchange while the baby is sleeping? This makes no sense as gift exchanges, at best, are loud and filled with noises of appreciation. Secondly- your issue has NOTHING to do with your baby being woken up, but rather you leapt on the opportunity to exclude your MIL from the evening because of your differences. You know, you COULD actually try to be a bigger and kinder person by just accepting her for who she is not who she isn't? It's possible.... you could let go of any expectations of gifts, you could choose to not get her anything or just get her something smaller to show some degree of respect, or you could just ignore one another. The real issue is... how does your PARTNER feel? Because, the MIL is, expectantly, THEIR parent?", "Do you apologize to people anytime your infant child suddenly screams? YTA.", "Yta and not only are you insane for holding a grudge for over a year but I hope mil NEVER helps you out financially or does anything for you and leaves you out of the will lol \ud83e\udd23", "Nah YTA on this one.", "Even though this is the MIL troll, y\u2019all are telling me OP is TA? \nOP extends an olive branch. Buys the ungrateful woman a gift for Christmas anyway. Ungrateful woman has an attitude if she has to buy gifts, hates getting gifts, but gets an attitude if she doesn\u2019t get a gift. \n\nWoman knows OP has a sleeping baby upstairs. But her reaction to a Christmas was to scream KNOWING she could wake up the baby. And when OP says \u201c hey, screaming indoors is inconsiderate. You woke up my baby,\u201d Woman\u2019s response is to tell OP she\u2019s ruining Christmas? \nLike OP\u2019s Christmas isn\u2019t gonna be ruined because she has to console an upset baby? A baby that won\u2019t want to go back to sleep but will be upset because it\u2019s tired?\nLike MIL hasn\u2019t been ruining Christmas all these years with her attitude?\n\nWtf is wrong with y\u2019all? There are some characters on this sub.\n\nNTA", "Wow. YTA. \n\nThis has to be one of those \u201cmonster in law\u201d trolls. No way this is real.", "For a second I was wondering if the MIL had jumped on top of the baby.", "More like he playcates your nonsense.", ">if I had a child who was miserable no matter what I did, I would feel like absolute shit\n\nI mean, YOU should kinda just feel like shit in general", "No moron, we\u2019re making YOU responsible. Stop hiding behind your infant daughter and just say that you hate this person being happy in your home.", "So many stories of MILs who are weirdly introverted with no emotions and then find an (often evil) boyfriend that finally makes them happy.", "Ifit's something like the ear piercing, high pitched screams my toddler brother used to have, that's indeed too happy and would be better toned down. Gladly puberty happened so it could be max a metal scream lol.", "Mainly my brother with hies toddler ear piercing shrieks. I was happy he was happy but my ears weren't happy.", "Don't forget never showed emotion till meeting her new boyfriend, who makes her obnoxiously happy"]}
