Last night he had the door locked but was playin music. It was late so I told him to turn it down, no response so I knock. Nothing, I call him and it goes to voice mail, I\u2019m panicking at this point and think he hit his head or something. No answers to anything we do so we take the door off the frame. He\u2019s not on his room. \n\nHe came back at 4 and was at a party, so he snuck out. As punishment his door is removed since of the lock and it will stay off until he gets a new door in about two weeks. That door will have the normal doorknob lock. My husband and I agree with this punishment but he told his friends and one parent keeps blowing up my phone calling me an asshole.\n\nNot to mention the argument I got in with my son, it\u2019s for two weeks until his door gets here, I need an outside opinion\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nI can\u2019t just remove the lock it\u2019s built into the door, it\u2019s not going anywhere, we have to have the locksmith change out the locks\n\nWell thanks to a comment, I checked to see if it was a parent, apparently there are ways to make the incoming message look like it from a different phone.

You are ultimately responsible for your son's safety and at 16 I wouldn't exactly trust his ability to think out long-term consequences for actions right now.\n\nAnd WTF with some rando outsider parent blowing up your phone?! Verrry suspicious. (Is it really another parent, or an older ringleader would be my first thought).\n\nI would offer a curtain to hang in the doorway for two weeks. This would provide some visual privacy.\n\nGood luck OP, parenting a teen isn't for the faint of heart.", "NTA. But if you haven\u2019t already, put up a sheet in his doorway. I think it\u2019s appropriate to take away his ability to lock his door, but not necessarily appropriate to take away his privacy.", "NTA. It's a short term, timeframed punishment directly related to the mechanism he used to sneak out.", "NTA\n\nYou took the door off to get in as you were concerned for your son's well-being. Now that the door is already off and he's getting a new door in a couple weeks he can deal with not having a door in the mean time. \n\nHe should know though that these events took place because of his poor judgement. Actions have consequences. Not only were you forced to remove the door from the frame because you thought something terrible had happened but after discovering him not in his room there was probably a sense of dread because he wasn't where you thought he was.\n\nAlso that parent blowing up your phone can kindly go fuck off. Nobody should tell you how to parent your kid unless your parenting is putting the child in harm's way.", "NTA\n\nYou are still his legal guardian and have a responsibility to ensure their safety. While I do not agree with the removal of the door entirely I understand this is for until you get a replacement with a normal lock you can access also. I don't think this is unreasonable honestly and it should teach them a lesson about sneaking out. \n\nAlso coming home at 4AM is not okay at 16 years old. He is lucky you didn't call the police to report him missing honestly. \n\nThe only thing I'll say is perhaps allow them to hang up something to stop people looking in like a towel or curtain just for the time.", "NTA But give the kid a curtain or sheet across the doorway please.", "Most posts I see on here about parents removing doors I feel like the parents are the ah, but not this one. NTA for me. When I was 16 I got into a lot of trouble and most of it was life threatening. I\u2019m terrified for when my kids are old enough to get into that kind of trouble. \n\nHe\u2019s mad now but one day he will understand that you were just trying to keep him safe.\n\nAlso F that other parent.", "Who the fuck is  this random parent to tell you whats what with your own kid? NTA.", "NTA.  He's using the lock on his door as a mechanism to sneak out of the house and stay out to all hours of the night.  Who gives AF about trust?  He could end up jail, hurt, or worse.  There are times that this would be a violation of trust, this isn't one.  Tell that other parent to screw right off and block them.  Their house is probably the party house.", "NTA. Maybe pin up a sheet or blanket for privacy, but the new custom door is coming in very soon. He lost old sneaky door privileges by taking advantage of your trust. Custom doors aren\u2019t free or available on demand, obviously. It won\u2019t wreck him permanently, just as he has not wrecked your trust permanently. \n\nRebuilding opportunity, and also he learns that most of the time we really don\u2019t get away with sneaky shit, as well as the value of thinking plans all the way through. Did he really think having music on all night wouldn\u2019t draw attention?? Kids are hilarious.", "NTA", "NTA.   But put a screen up for privacy", "I mean it is a pretty extreme / severe action - obviously removing the LOCK would be more appropriate - but you're limited to the circumstances required of getting a suitable replacement non-locking door, from what I gather. So NTA. It is temporary, and a direct response to a MAJOR transgression on his part.\n\nIt seems like possibly more / better communication is in order. Does he understand why you are upset, how wrong it was for him to sneak out? Does he know it's hurtful to target all blame for this punishment on only you? Has he expressed remorse or an understanding of the importance of that not recurring, etc.? These to me are more important than the punishment.", "Nta, he snuck out and he's being punished. Two weeks is not an unreasonable punishment for sneaking out. As far as privacy goes, hang a sheet till the door arrives. He'll survive the consequences of his actions and maybe learn a lesson.", "I guess I would remove the door as a consequence of sneaking out. I wouldn't ground him and explain that the door is gone for a couple days or weeks in order for him to become more connected to the family. If he wants to party he should be able to ask openly and accept your answer.  \nI Think it's important for kids to understand why a certain consequence is happening and what the goal of the consequence is.  \nAfter a certain time, return the door and see how things go from there.", "NTA, but I would probably look into some middle ground. Like returning the door after a couple of days instead of waiting for the next door or something alike. If you go too hard, even if deserved, you might damage all possible trust in your relationship and things like that will keep on happening, just through different routes. Also, this probably should be addressed in other areas of your life, because going out until 4 am is quite something.", "NTA. But would you be willing to tape up a sheet in the doorway for the meantime ? This might be a good way of easing tension with your son too, since it lessens the punishment while still staying firm.", "I am hysterically laughing right now.  \n\nI had a rule when my son was younger. No locked doors except the bath.  No closed doors when he had a friend over.  He lost the door knob once when he locked it to play games instead of doing homework so he knew I would uphold the rules.  \n\nHe had a fried over one day playing video games and goofing off in his room.  Door open.  Normal volume voices carry in my house. There were some muted jumbled whispers floating from his room when I suddenly heard my son say \u201cno dude, she\u2019ll take my door!!\u201d   \n\nI had to go outside so they would not hear me laughing.  \n\nNota bena: Son told me later his friend was suggesting visiting dubious websites and he was not going for it.  \n\nYour son snuck out.  He gets no door.", "Old gal here.  I get it, he snuck out.  But I will promise you this..... Removing his door is just escalating the issue.  Hear me out.  It doesn't stop him from doing other behaviors that you worry about.  Smoking, drugs, sex, stealing, alcohol. (just to name a few).\n\nMy advice?  Everyone take a deep breath.  You're reaction is because you are scared.  Understood.  When you and hubby are calm, sit down with him and have an adult conversation.  Yes, I know that legally he's not an adult but let's face it, in less than 2 years he is eligible to fight a war.  \n\nTell him you want honestly in your relationship and in return, you will try and respect his wants, but you are still Mom and Dad, so he\u2019s going to hear the word \u201cNo\u201d on occasion and how he responds to it will determine future decisions.  \n\nHe is 16 and no door on his room is not appropriate let alone no lock.  If he continues to abuse your trust, the issue is NOT a locked door.  Good luck.", "NTA.\n\nYou did everything you could to make sure he was okay, while he did everything he could to deceive you into thinking he was in his room when he was not. If your house was on fire, you'd almost certainly have died trying to reach him and get him to safety.\n\nActions have consequences. He's lucky he's allowed to keep his bedroom, which is a privilege. \n\nI'd install a tracking app on his phone after that. You should always know:\n\n- where he's going to be (last known location)\n- who he will be with (witnesses/suspects)\n- what time he expects to be home (when to call police)", "[deleted]", "NTA consequences are how kids learn what's acceptable and what's unacceptable behavior. Also out of already told that other parent to go fuck themselves in mind their business who the fuck are they", "Establishing trust with a teenager isn't a straight line. There are going to be bumps in the road, and this was obviously one. But if you react by removing his privacy entirely, even for a limited time, I feel like he's going to be even less likely to be honest with you in the future.", "ESH. He needs a punishment for sneaking out but privacy, especially for a teenager, is not a privilege to be revoked. Take his phone so he can\u2019t talk to his friends, make him share his location with you so you can see where he is, but don\u2019t take his door.", "NTA he snuck out so now he needs to be supervised and it\u2019s literally only two weeks", "[deleted]", "YTA. \n\nThat punishment is so outdated and obnoxious I can\u2019t believe any modern parent would do it. People deserve privacy even when they fuck up. Imagine if you made a big mistake and your employer removed your office door, or your partner removed the bedroom door. It\u2019s a bullshit lazy punishment that doesn\u2019t actually revolve anything and creates an unnecessary power struggle. \n\nPerhaps have a talk with your child about the dangers of sneaking out and no one knowing where he is. Door removal is not a natural consequence, and won\u2019t teach him anything other than how to be even more sneaky. All that\u2019s going to happen is he\u2019s going to resent you, and get better at sneaking out. You\u2019re creating a dynamic where your child has to lie to you in order to have freedom and fun. \n\nAll you\u2019re teaching your child is that when they make a mistake they are no longer entitled to basic human necessities like privacy. Have fun when he starts being intimate with himself in the bathroom and spends a long amount of time in there because you\u2019ve deprived him of a private space. \n\nGood luck OP.", "> I need an outside opinion\n\nYTA. Removing the door from the bedroom of a teenager is pretty nuclear. Trust has been broken. Removing the door demonstrates that, but it won't eliminate the need for privacy. Your son WILL seek privacy and if he can't it at home....\n\nBrowse around for awhile. A lot of stories told by people who end up going low / no contact are told by people with parents that felt justified removing bed room doors. The next step is randomly throwing away all the stuff that is \"theirs\" but that you paid for...", "Removing the door is somewhat extreme punishment but considering the circumstances which seemingly make it impossible to remove a lock (though this seems a bit weird to me) and since you already ordered a new door I'd say NTA. Maybe hang a blanket over it for the time being", "NTA - kid can live without a door for a couple of weeks", "NTA this is literally his fault. I am not condoning sneaking out but he left his music on. It\u2019s his fault in every way. 2 weeks no door is a pretty light punishment.", "Info: How much of his privacy are you taking away? Can he still hang a sheet over the doorway and are you still asking permission before entering his room?", "This was a strategy of a parenting class I attended. It was called the Parent Project. The door was placed in the garage and child earned it back. I didn\u2019t resort to it but some had success.", "[deleted]", "Adding judgement here is a bit complicated, but maybe there are a few things you should consider before doing that. \n  Teenagers value privacy more than ANYTHING else in life. Also, most people consider it to be a fundamental right. If you take his door, you are basically leaving him exposed to the whole house, which might seem fair considering he lied to you and snuck out, but is more likely to hurt your relationship in the long run. \n  Since you will be changing the doors anyway, I would suggest getting a privacy screen or something else to make him a little more comfortable. Even though he was a complete asshole, he still deserves not to feel threatened/uncomfortable in his own home. \n  Teenagers are assholes. I would know that because I am one. But the way you interact with them now is very likely going to have a huge impact in shaping the relationship you\u2019ll have in the future. Also, he might sneak out again or do worse things if you don\u2019t actually talk to him and make him feel like he can tell you things. If he feels that every time you find out he\u2019s done something bad he gets punished, he\u2019s not going to stop doing those things but he is going to stop telling you. Trying to talk it out while also finding a suitable punishment seems to be the best option here.", "YTA, I get that it'll take time to get him a new door, but in the longterm he needs privacy.    \nInstead of taking that from him you should have an open conversation. Start of with an apology for taking the door, that might get him to a point where he'll be open to listen to you.    \nTell him, that going to a party would have been fine if he had told you about it. That it is better to know where he is. Imagine something on his way home would have happened. You wouldn't even have known where to look for him.   \n\nYes, letting your son go party is scary. But having him sneak out is scarier. And he WILL find ways to get out. He will find ways to go to parties and stuff. Instead of taking things away from him you should talk to him. Show him that you understand that he is growing up and wants to do stuff - and that he is allowed to do stuff but in moderation. He can go to the party, but he should be home by Whatever o'clock. You can still punish him if he fails to stick to those rules. But at least give him a try.", "YTA is that truly the best way you could ensure your son doesn\u2019t leave the house? By taking away his privacy", "YTA. Remove the lock, not the whole door. A teen his age needs privacy. This is a fundamental right.  You can and should punish him for sneaking out though, just find something more appropriate", "[deleted]", "YTA. Get a privacy screen or curtain.", "ESH.\n\nYour kid not only displayed disrespect by sneaking out, he also put himself in a dangerous situation. Clearly, he's not mature enough to manage his behaviors, so yeah, something must be done.\n\nSit down and have a heart-to-heart. Take inventory of your feelings and explain the root of your outrage - my guess is that it's fear for his health and safety, and sadness that trust has been broken.\n\nYou may also reinforce the safety concern with a family app like FindMyFriends. I know I may get downvoted because some feel this is a violation of privacy, but my family has used this for years and neither of my teens has an issue with it. In fact, it's helpful for everyone and my kids probably use it more than I do (\"What are you doing at a bar on the west side lol\" or \"Heeey, you're right by Chipotle - can you pick me up a burrito??\"). Maybe that won't work for you, but it's helped me feel better about when my kids are out and even though I don't check up on them often, the oldest told me it helped him to make better choices because he knew I could see where he was. Even when curfew is broken, it's nice to know where they are and see that they're on their way home or at least they are where they're supposed to be. Prevents a lot of unnecessary hostility, arguing, etc. I know it's not for everyone, just mentioning it here because it's worked well for us.\n\nEDIT: OP is not planning to permanently remove the door, so suggestions above are meant as compromise for teen and parents to rebuild trust.", "YTA", "Here's the thing with door removal, and I always comment this: it's a fire safety issue.

Would it have kept me from sneaking out in the future? Maybe not but it would have made me think things through more thoroughly first.  (\u201cIs it worth it to sneak out?  What goes next? The bed??\u201d) \nIt\u2019s temporary ferfecksake.  \nMom once said to me after logical action-based consequence of a truly stupid stunt I pulled and i was fuming at her about the \u2018injustice\u2019: \u201cI can handle you being mad at me.

I\u2019m impressed by your restraint at JUST taking it off the hinges, I might have panicked and kicked it in.\n\nETA: I can\u2019t imagine the look on his face when he climbed in his window and there you were.", "NTA. There are very few cases where removing a door like this is acceptable and this is one of those. But if you haven't already a curtain or sheet put up in the doorway will still leave him with privacy and others should still knock like there is a door assuming that isn't already being done.", "NTA", "You are NTA. Well done, also. The reason the door is missing is because you had to get in due to his deception. I'd for sure be leaving it off - not just for 2 weeks but until you can trust in this situation.\n\nFurther, when my kids were teens, we bought them phones and explained the whole reason for them to have these phones is so that we can contact them whenever we need to. Any time that we contact them and they don't respond, dont answer, don't text back etc, we will just cancel the phone plan immediately since the whole reason the phone was purchased was for that reason.  Of my 3 kids, my middle daughter had to have her phone canceled. I was super slow to reinstate it and she lost her number and had to start all over.", "NTA. Sooooo your son left music on so you'd think he was there? Who did he think would turn it off? Did he think no one would notice as it got later and later.

Sure, sneaking out sucks, but then make him report like every 60 minutes or something when he's not supposed to go out instead of TAKING AWAY HIS BEDROOM DOOR. \n\nAnd I thought my parents were strict at times.

(people have done studies by setting model homes on fire and have indeed found closing doors slows fire spread and limits issues from smoke inhalation. This fact is backed by science and fire departments.) A door is just as much about safety as it privacy.\n\nHowever it would be prudent to hang up a curtain. As others pointed out teens tend to crave some level of privacy. Your son already doesn't really care about the dangers of being out late considering he was out till 4 am. If he doesn't feel comfortable enough at home, it could encurage him to stay out later/more often since being outside would be deemed more desirable to him.

If I heard of someone doing this to a teenager now, and only got one side of the story (they broke a rule and now their parents took their door away!) I would be concerned about the situation (without the context of what else was going on with the rule-breaking being directly linked to the locked door and how it was initially removed because of a safety concern). However, I wouldn't blow up a parent's phone about this. If I thought a teenager, especially one of my kid's friends, was in an abusive situation, I wouldn't want to make the other parent think that their kid was telling people/complaining, because again, I had friends with families like that, and if they thought their kid 'told,' they'd get even more angry and things would get worse for their kid. It definitely wouldn't be my approach.\n\nThe fact that this other parent is behaving this way makes me think that either a) it's a kid who's using their parent's phone or b) it's a parent who's not really concerned about a possible abuse dynamic, but is just... A little erratic? \n\nAlso, to be clear, I don't think OP is abusive, given the particular circumstances here.

Some families want to keep to a normal daily schedule during the summer, and others let the teens stay up late and then sleep in on their own schedule.

And knowing that, I am not going to call anyone TA. Just provide some comments from my own experience of once being a teenager with that removed bedroom door to give some food for thought about what kind of relationship you want with your child moving forward. \n\nThe \"punishment\" of removing my bedroom door time to time when I was a teenager (for various issues like not cleaning my room, talking on phone when should have been doing homework, sneaking alcohol, for example) certainly *did not* do much to foster a strong healthy relationship with my parents and did not feel safe talking or disclosing to them as a teenager, or even for my adult life. Now, I can't say it is the act alone of removing my door time to time that led to that, that sort of relationship was already brewing before a door was ever first removed from my bedroom, and there were other \"punishments\" too that were in my view were harmful, but to me the door removal felt like a complete invasion of my privacy - particularly as a teenage girl living in a house with five other people - and while I did form a *better* relationship with my parents *as an adult*, I can't say it was ever very close or trusting like I for example saw my younger siblings enjoy with my parents (and while my siblings did equally egregious things or worse, they learned to be better at hiding it AND were not subject to the same kind of punishments as I was when she was caught). It most certainly was very dysfunctional during my teenage and early adult years. I quite frankly just did not trust sharing much information with them - or even much about myself and who I was as a person - ever, not even in my adult life, and even when things were better I was always guarded with them. Those actions by them only sort of made me double down on being secretive and distancing myself from them further. I am in my 40s and still have very mixed feelings about my relationship growing up with my parents (and what was not, and what could have been), arising a lot from their forms of punishment like this, and my mother passed away many years ago so even though at this point I have kind of made \"peace\" with their doing the best, there are no chances to heal a lot of the results from that. I miss her dearly, love her, know she tried her best at the time...but I also see how her best often came in the form of being more focused on punishment or retribution, than of understanding for why or trying to understand me as as my own individual, or helping guide me through learning about consequences, versus punishment. \n\nFor me the door removals were also \"temporary\" (and I didn't get any curtains or privacy during them either!). However, it was not just about the door removal, it was about the overall dynamic and when I see these kinds of punishments they strike me as very reactive - more punitive than about creating learning opportunities about consequences - and not really addressing the underlying issues: I  think this warrants a bigger conversation about *why* he is sneaking out and hiding things: removing the door is not going to fix that, and in fact, I would not at all be surprised if he just got better about being secretive in other ways, or became less trusting of confiding in you overall, and you can't necessarily expect that to get better with time or aging. Life is short, and often runs out before you get that chance. \n\nYes, there are safety concerns here. I fully acknowledge that it is well within reason there are consequences for your son sneaking out and staying out until 4:00am at 16 years of age. You are completely in your rights to be out of your mind with worry about the what ifs. You are completely in your rights to give him consequences for his actions.\n\nI just think this raises  issues though of:\n\n1. are the consequences you have imposed reasonably connected to the action and scaled to the action (i.e. is removing his privacy entirely a reasonable consequence for his dishonesty and sneaking out, or is there another consequence that is better suited - i.e. he just has to agree he is not allowed to keep the door to his room locked overnight or between a set timeframe, or can you just remove the doorknob for now so it can't be locked, etc?)\n2. why is he being dishonest/why does he feel need to sneak out - i.e. is he feeling he needs to succumb to peer pressure, to go against the expectations/\"rules\" you have, etc. What is going on with your son that he is doing that - could be innocent enough part of being a stupid teenager with a stupid teenage brain, but is there more to it?\n\nDo not discount the value of individual therapy (for him) or family therapy (for all of you).\n\nI definitely do not think you need to listen to his friends or his \"friends' parents\" - I sincerely doubt other parents are interfering this much with your parenting decisions. Seems suspect that someone else is using someone else's phone or something.", "NTA.  I think that removing the door is a logical punishment. He used the locked door to break a reasonable house rule.

They were probably tweenaged, say... 10 & 12ish (maybe a year younger).\n\nMy son arrived home from school and had the phone (that they were using as a glorified ipod). My daughter got home a bit later and asked him for it. I did not hear it go down as I had been on my computer in the kitchen (all I could hear was the noise and not the content).\n\nBut basically my son would not relent. Their bedroom doors are facing each other. Well, as she left his room and stepped into hers, she left his door open, turned and screamed at him, and then slammed the door 3 times, HARD. It was a very loud and very sharp RAP/CRACK; wasn't like she just shut it a little bit harder than normal.\n\nWell... his window was open. And the neighbor living there whose bedroom was on the same end as my son was a little older, so she basically thought someone was being murdered. So, maybe 3 minutes passes and I finish what I was doing (likely playing a game), and walk to my daughter's room. At that point I was little heated over the entire situation and the fact that rather than coming to me, she chose that route. So, I did pull her door off. Again, it was more than just a little hard shut. \n\nAs I finish speaking with her, I walked out of her bedroom and basically did a U-turn into my living room. At that point, I see she also left the front door open, so I start walking towards it. At that point, I see someone in my driveway and I'm like WTF? Then I notice it's a Sheriff's Deputy. THEN I notice his gun is out. So I'm like YO WTF?!? to myself as I continue to the door. He sees me. Get your hands up, etc. Has me step out of the door.\n\nAs I do, like 3 other Deputies swarm me.

The less judgement you show, the more likely he\u2019ll be to consider your feelings and be honest. Ask him why he went without telling you and what you can do to compromise in the future. Explain to him why disappearing from his room has serious consequences and give him other options so he doesn\u2019t feel the need to do something like that again. Teenagers are wired to want to have fun and socialize. Giving them an outlet for that fun while also setting ground rules will stop him from keeping secrets without enabling bad behaviour.
