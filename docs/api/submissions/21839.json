You are ultimately responsible for your son's safety and at 16 I wouldn't exactly trust his ability to think out long-term consequences for actions right now.\n\nAnd WTF with some rando outsider parent blowing up your phone?! Verrry suspicious. (Is it really another parent, or an older ringleader would be my first thought).\n\nI would offer a curtain to hang in the doorway for two weeks. This would provide some visual privacy.\n\nGood luck OP, parenting a teen isn't for the faint of heart.", "NTA. But if you haven\u2019t already, put up a sheet in his doorway. I think it\u2019s appropriate to take away his ability to lock his door, but not necessarily appropriate to take away his privacy.", "NTA. It's a short term, timeframed punishment directly related to the mechanism he used to sneak out.", "NTA\n\nYou took the door off to get in as you were concerned for your son's well-being. Now that the door is already off and he's getting a new door in a couple weeks he can deal with not having a door in the mean time. \n\nHe should know though that these events took place because of his poor judgement. Actions have consequences. Not only were you forced to remove the door from the frame because you thought something terrible had happened but after discovering him not in his room there was probably a sense of dread because he wasn't where you thought he was.\n\nAlso that parent blowing up your phone can kindly go fuck off. Nobody should tell you how to parent your kid unless your parenting is putting the child in harm's way.", "NTA\n\nYou are still his legal guardian and have a responsibility to ensure their safety. While I do not agree with the removal of the door entirely I understand this is for until you get a replacement with a normal lock you can access also. I don't think this is unreasonable honestly and it should teach them a lesson about sneaking out. \n\nAlso coming home at 4AM is not okay at 16 years old. He is lucky you didn't call the police to report him missing honestly. \n\nThe only thing I'll say is perhaps allow them to hang up something to stop people looking in like a towel or curtain just for the time.", "NTA But give the kid a curtain or sheet across the doorway please.", "Most posts I see on here about parents removing doors I feel like the parents are the ah, but not this one. NTA for me. When I was 16 I got into a lot of trouble and most of it was life threatening. I\u2019m terrified for when my kids are old enough to get into that kind of trouble. \n\nHe\u2019s mad now but one day he will understand that you were just trying to keep him safe.\n\nAlso F that other parent.", "Who the fuck is  this random parent to tell you whats what with your own kid? NTA.", "NTA.  He's using the lock on his door as a mechanism to sneak out of the house and stay out to all hours of the night.  Who gives AF about trust?  He could end up jail, hurt, or worse.  There are times that this would be a violation of trust, this isn't one.  Tell that other parent to screw right off and block them.  Their house is probably the party house.", "NTA. Maybe pin up a sheet or blanket for privacy, but the new custom door is coming in very soon. He lost old sneaky door privileges by taking advantage of your trust. Custom doors aren\u2019t free or available on demand, obviously. It won\u2019t wreck him permanently, just as he has not wrecked your trust permanently. \n\nRebuilding opportunity, and also he learns that most of the time we really don\u2019t get away with sneaky shit, as well as the value of thinking plans all the way through. Did he really think having music on all night wouldn\u2019t draw attention?? Kids are hilarious.", "NTA", "NTA.   But put a screen up for privacy", "I mean it is a pretty extreme / severe action - obviously removing the LOCK would be more appropriate - but you're limited to the circumstances required of getting a suitable replacement non-locking door, from what I gather. So NTA. It is temporary, and a direct response to a MAJOR transgression on his part.\n\nIt seems like possibly more / better communication is in order. Does he understand why you are upset, how wrong it was for him to sneak out? Does he know it's hurtful to target all blame for this punishment on only you? Has he expressed remorse or an understanding of the importance of that not recurring, etc.? These to me are more important than the punishment.", "Nta, he snuck out and he's being punished. Two weeks is not an unreasonable punishment for sneaking out. As far as privacy goes, hang a sheet till the door arrives. He'll survive the consequences of his actions and maybe learn a lesson.", "I guess I would remove the door as a consequence of sneaking out. I wouldn't ground him and explain that the door is gone for a couple days or weeks in order for him to become more connected to the family. If he wants to party he should be able to ask openly and accept your answer.  \nI Think it's important for kids to understand why a certain consequence is happening and what the goal of the consequence is.  \nAfter a certain time, return the door and see how things go from there.", "NTA, but I would probably look into some middle ground. Like returning the door after a couple of days instead of waiting for the next door or something alike. If you go too hard, even if deserved, you might damage all possible trust in your relationship and things like that will keep on happening, just through different routes. Also, this probably should be addressed in other areas of your life, because going out until 4 am is quite something.", "NTA. But would you be willing to tape up a sheet in the doorway for the meantime ? This might be a good way of easing tension with your son too, since it lessens the punishment while still staying firm.", "I am hysterically laughing right now.  \n\nI had a rule when my son was younger. No locked doors except the bath.  No closed doors when he had a friend over.  He lost the door knob once when he locked it to play games instead of doing homework so he knew I would uphold the rules.  \n\nHe had a fried over one day playing video games and goofing off in his room.  Door open.  Normal volume voices carry in my house. There were some muted jumbled whispers floating from his room when I suddenly heard my son say \u201cno dude, she\u2019ll take my door!!\u201d   \n\nI had to go outside so they would not hear me laughing.  \n\nNota bena: Son told me later his friend was suggesting visiting dubious websites and he was not going for it.  \n\nYour son snuck out.  He gets no door.", "Old gal here.  I get it, he snuck out.  But I will promise you this..... Removing his door is just escalating the issue.  Hear me out.  It doesn't stop him from doing other behaviors that you worry about.  Smoking, drugs, sex, stealing, alcohol. (just to name a few).\n\nMy advice?  Everyone take a deep breath.  You're reaction is because you are scared.  Understood.  When you and hubby are calm, sit down with him and have an adult conversation.  Yes, I know that legally he's not an adult but let's face it, in less than 2 years he is eligible to fight a war.  \n\nTell him you want honestly in your relationship and in return, you will try and respect his wants, but you are still Mom and Dad, so he\u2019s going to hear the word \u201cNo\u201d on occasion and how he responds to it will determine future decisions.  \n\nHe is 16 and no door on his room is not appropriate let alone no lock.  If he continues to abuse your trust, the issue is NOT a locked door.  Good luck.", "NTA.\n\nYou did everything you could to make sure he was okay, while he did everything he could to deceive you into thinking he was in his room when he was not. If your house was on fire, you'd almost certainly have died trying to reach him and get him to safety.\n\nActions have consequences. He's lucky he's allowed to keep his bedroom, which is a privilege. \n\nI'd install a tracking app on his phone after that. You should always know:\n\n- where he's going to be (last known location)\n- who he will be with (witnesses/suspects)\n- what time he expects to be home (when to call police)", "[deleted]", "NTA consequences are how kids learn what's acceptable and what's unacceptable behavior. Also out of already told that other parent to go fuck themselves in mind their business who the fuck are they", "Establishing trust with a teenager isn't a straight line. There are going to be bumps in the road, and this was obviously one. But if you react by removing his privacy entirely, even for a limited time, I feel like he's going to be even less likely to be honest with you in the future.", "ESH. He needs a punishment for sneaking out but privacy, especially for a teenager, is not a privilege to be revoked. Take his phone so he can\u2019t talk to his friends, make him share his location with you so you can see where he is, but don\u2019t take his door.", "NTA he snuck out so now he needs to be supervised and it\u2019s literally only two weeks", "[deleted]", "YTA. \n\nThat punishment is so outdated and obnoxious I can\u2019t believe any modern parent would do it. People deserve privacy even when they fuck up. Imagine if you made a big mistake and your employer removed your office door, or your partner removed the bedroom door. It\u2019s a bullshit lazy punishment that doesn\u2019t actually revolve anything and creates an unnecessary power struggle. \n\nPerhaps have a talk with your child about the dangers of sneaking out and no one knowing where he is. Door removal is not a natural consequence, and won\u2019t teach him anything other than how to be even more sneaky. All that\u2019s going to happen is he\u2019s going to resent you, and get better at sneaking out. You\u2019re creating a dynamic where your child has to lie to you in order to have freedom and fun. \n\nAll you\u2019re teaching your child is that when they make a mistake they are no longer entitled to basic human necessities like privacy. Have fun when he starts being intimate with himself in the bathroom and spends a long amount of time in there because you\u2019ve deprived him of a private space. \n\nGood luck OP.", "> I need an outside opinion\n\nYTA. Removing the door from the bedroom of a teenager is pretty nuclear. Trust has been broken. Removing the door demonstrates that, but it won't eliminate the need for privacy. Your son WILL seek privacy and if he can't it at home....\n\nBrowse around for awhile. A lot of stories told by people who end up going low / no contact are told by people with parents that felt justified removing bed room doors. The next step is randomly throwing away all the stuff that is \"theirs\" but that you paid for...", "Removing the door is somewhat extreme punishment but considering the circumstances which seemingly make it impossible to remove a lock (though this seems a bit weird to me) and since you already ordered a new door I'd say NTA. Maybe hang a blanket over it for the time being", "NTA - kid can live without a door for a couple of weeks", "NTA this is literally his fault. I am not condoning sneaking out but he left his music on. It\u2019s his fault in every way. 2 weeks no door is a pretty light punishment.", "Info: How much of his privacy are you taking away? Can he still hang a sheet over the doorway and are you still asking permission before entering his room?", "This was a strategy of a parenting class I attended. It was called the Parent Project. The door was placed in the garage and child earned it back. I didn\u2019t resort to it but some had success.", "[deleted]", "Adding judgement here is a bit complicated, but maybe there are a few things you should consider before doing that. \n  Teenagers value privacy more than ANYTHING else in life. Also, most people consider it to be a fundamental right. If you take his door, you are basically leaving him exposed to the whole house, which might seem fair considering he lied to you and snuck out, but is more likely to hurt your relationship in the long run. \n  Since you will be changing the doors anyway, I would suggest getting a privacy screen or something else to make him a little more comfortable. Even though he was a complete asshole, he still deserves not to feel threatened/uncomfortable in his own home. \n  Teenagers are assholes. I would know that because I am one. But the way you interact with them now is very likely going to have a huge impact in shaping the relationship you\u2019ll have in the future. Also, he might sneak out again or do worse things if you don\u2019t actually talk to him and make him feel like he can tell you things. If he feels that every time you find out he\u2019s done something bad he gets punished, he\u2019s not going to stop doing those things but he is going to stop telling you. Trying to talk it out while also finding a suitable punishment seems to be the best option here.", "YTA, I get that it'll take time to get him a new door, but in the longterm he needs privacy.    \nInstead of taking that from him you should have an open conversation. Start of with an apology for taking the door, that might get him to a point where he'll be open to listen to you.    \nTell him, that going to a party would have been fine if he had told you about it. That it is better to know where he is. Imagine something on his way home would have happened. You wouldn't even have known where to look for him.   \n\nYes, letting your son go party is scary. But having him sneak out is scarier. And he WILL find ways to get out. He will find ways to go to parties and stuff. Instead of taking things away from him you should talk to him. Show him that you understand that he is growing up and wants to do stuff - and that he is allowed to do stuff but in moderation. He can go to the party, but he should be home by Whatever o'clock. You can still punish him if he fails to stick to those rules. But at least give him a try.", "YTA is that truly the best way you could ensure your son doesn\u2019t leave the house? By taking away his privacy", "YTA. Remove the lock, not the whole door. A teen his age needs privacy. This is a fundamental right.  You can and should punish him for sneaking out though, just find something more appropriate", "[deleted]", "YTA. Get a privacy screen or curtain.", "ESH.\n\nYour kid not only displayed disrespect by sneaking out, he also put himself in a dangerous situation. Clearly, he's not mature enough to manage his behaviors, so yeah, something must be done.\n\nSit down and have a heart-to-heart. Take inventory of your feelings and explain the root of your outrage - my guess is that it's fear for his health and safety, and sadness that trust has been broken.\n\nYou may also reinforce the safety concern with a family app like FindMyFriends. I know I may get downvoted because some feel this is a violation of privacy, but my family has used this for years and neither of my teens has an issue with it. In fact, it's helpful for everyone and my kids probably use it more than I do (\"What are you doing at a bar on the west side lol\" or \"Heeey, you're right by Chipotle - can you pick me up a burrito??\"). Maybe that won't work for you, but it's helped me feel better about when my kids are out and even though I don't check up on them often, the oldest told me it helped him to make better choices because he knew I could see where he was. Even when curfew is broken, it's nice to know where they are and see that they're on their way home or at least they are where they're supposed to be. Prevents a lot of unnecessary hostility, arguing, etc. I know it's not for everyone, just mentioning it here because it's worked well for us.\n\nEDIT: OP is not planning to permanently remove the door, so suggestions above are meant as compromise for teen and parents to rebuild trust.", "YTA", "Here's the thing with door removal, and I always comment this: it's a fire safety issue.

It is only for two weeks until they can get the new door", "I think I read the new door will be done in 2 weeks", "That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing\u2026lol", "That comes in. Two weeks", "Well, not really. In certain circumstances, yes, but a 16 year old doesn't really NEED a lock. If they have invasive family members, yes, they need a lock. But if the family is actually respectful of privacy, no, the kid only needs a door to close, they do not need a lock on their bedroom door.", "The issue is that we don't know what kind of old home OP has, so it's hard to say, but the bigger thing is that OP is trying to give their son a door with a lock still on it. I assume it would be easier to put in a normal door with no lock, but OP is insistent on a lock still. Personally, I think the son lost his privileges to have a lock, but I guess it's easier to do this if they're planning on putting a lock back on even after his punishment.", "How fast is \u201cswiftly\u201d?  It\u2019s only going to be two weeks.  If it\u2019s an old house it\u2019s very possible that the doors are oddly sized.", "Curtain/sheet, same idea/thing", "Bot!

The lock cannot be removed from the door", "You can remove the place where the lock clicks into in the door frame, much easier if the pop lock is not accessible.

Very smart consequence that will absolutely work.", "Goddamn dude, just because you were too strict with your kids doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to worry about a slippery slope. You don\u2019t know this kid and neither do any of us. Maybe removing his door will make him act out even worse. You\u2019re making several assumptions here.

One strong reaction to a huge issue does not make a too strict parent.", "They can\u2019t do that with any door. \n\nManaging safety means teaching the kid how to be safe on his own.", "You can have an appropriate reaction without having to remove the door. That\u2019s all they were saying. You jumped in calling it an \u201cawful take\u201d instead of responding in a mature manner explaining your disagreement. So if we\u2019re in the business of jumping to conclusions, I have nothing left to conclude other than you being prone to overreaction. See how unfair that is?", "How many kids do you have and how old are they?", "Id say having your door off for two weeks will teach him not to betray his parents trust and sneak out again.
