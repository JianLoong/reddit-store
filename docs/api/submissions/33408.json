She and my dad were married but she kept her last name and he kept his. Then when I was born I got my mom's last name. When I was 8 my mom died and when I was 11 my dad remarried.  My little sister is 13. My stepmother came into the marriage with three kids of her own. The older two have a different dad from her younger kid. Their dad's are deadbeats and my stepsiblings never knew them.\n\nMy dad and stepmother had a baby together last year. He has both their last names. My stepsiblings were upset when he got to match both dad and stepmother and they were upset dad didn't adopt them. So the suggestion was made for dad to adopt them and my stepmother to adopt me and my sister then we all take the hyphenated name \"dad's last name-stepmother's last name\". I said no to both and told them I didn't want to be adopted or to have my name changed. My sister said she didn't really want to but said if it was a big deal for dad she would agree. He thanked her.\n\nFor the next few months my dad and stepmother told me all the reasons they felt these changes were good and important. They brought a therapist in to speak to me and the therapist told me it would be okay to be adopted and to have the security my stepmother could provide if she were my legal mother.\n\nI never changed my mind and told them I still would not consent to the adoption.\n\nOnce they (sorta kinda maybe) accepted that they told me to consider hyphenating my last name at least. They said I could even have three. Keep my mom's if I really insist on it, but they don't know why I was making such a big deal out of it, and adding the hyphenated name as well. They said it would make addressing our whole family SO much easier and would mean a lot to everyone. My dad said it would be nice for both his kids to finally have his last name. My stepmother said it would be very symbolic for her, to feel like I have accepted her as a third parent and that it would mean I do want to be part of her and her kids' family. She told me how I feel about my last name and keeping it my mom's, is just as important to her that my sister and I have her name in there too. She told me she really loves me and to imagine how much happiness it would bring. She also said it would be less confusing for my half brother and my future half sister (she's pregnant again).\n\nI told them I did not want my name changed or added to. I told them it felt disrespectful to dismiss how important my last name is. I told them I am the one who has to live with the name and I don't want to take their new hyphenated name. My dad told me my sister was willing and didn't I want to match with her at least. I told him she doesn't even want to, she's doing it for him, which she made very clear when she agreed.

That meant a lot to my mom and I think it's awesome as hell to have that. It's always the dad's name people feel should be passed on. But I love that it's my mom's and that it wasn't just my sister who got it but me, her son.", "I thought maybe some church person who acts as a therapist but isn't really fully qualified.", "No, and I said no to the adoption multiple times.", "I'll also add that, from a traditional standpoint, your sister would likely be changing her name again anyway when she gets married, while you likely would not. Her children would likely have her husband's name, while yours would likely have whatever name you have.\n\n(Not that it's necessarily the case. I'm the mom and our kids have my last name. My husband uses my name socially, but kept his name for professional reasons. He might take my name legally when he retires.)", "That\u2019s very special. Hold on to that name with pride and joy! I can\u2019t imagine a therapist that wouldn\u2019t support your decision \u2026.did they just pay someone to act like a \u201ctherapist\u201d \u2026it\u2019s suspicious. It\u2019s a major breach of trust and respect for them to treat you this way in my opinion.", "Names are important, especially when they represent people that you lost. It sounds like you\u2019ve tried to explain yourself and it has fallen on deaf ears. I\u2019m sorry that your own family is disrespecting you this way but if it\u2019s any cold comfort you are certainly not the AH here.", "Stand your ground!", "Oh that's very cool!   Stand strong!  Keep your last name.", "This is a beautiful tradition! There are places in the world where it is not even legal to change your name after marriage to a shared surname, and many places where it is not commonly assumed people will do this. Everybody gets and keeps their own name throughout their life. No one should be trying to force this on you, especially when you are carrying on a family name given to you by your late Mom!", "Oh that\u2019s super special I wouldn\u2019t change it either", "That's neat. \nOne of my kids has my mom's maiden name as her middle name. I love the name and love the idea of holding onto it a bit longer. My mom had 2 daughters, and my sister and I each had 2 daughters, so it won't get passed down the traditional way.", "next time they bring it up go full Daniel Day-Lewis on them \nhttps://youtu.be/K19FtgBlz2A?si=O8KAa21lgERIStoQ", "As a compromise, could you take your dad's (and/or step mum's) last name as an additional \"middle\" name? It would technically be there, but not part of your actual last name so most places that only want first & last would be the same as now?", "No good therapist would tell you that you should change your name because it\u2019ll mean a lot to someone else. What they should have told you is that you\u2019re well within your rights to keep your name, it\u2019s not wrong of you to feel attached to it.", "It seems like a good idea for the family that the parents *offer* adoption and a common last name to tie the family closer together, but it should not be forced. You are old enough to make your own choice and if you don't feel the need for a new mom  then that's absolutely fine. \n\nIt also makes a lot of sense to hang on to your mother's name if you want to. Your actions and feelings towards the new, big family are completely unrelated to what names you all have.\n\nNTA.", "What came up when you googled the therapist? I\u2019m very curious.", "You are entitled to keep your name, but many countries such as Spain and most hispanic country use hyphenated name and it is becoming more and more current in France as well so the argument of hyphenated being too long is not a great argument.", "OMG OP what was your grandfather's last name before he changed it for your grandmother? Suggest everyone change their last name to that.", "If she doesn't change her mind and end up changing her name, maybe remind her at some point in the future that she has the option to change back. Either when she is 18, or later if she marries or has kids since she might need to reconsider her last name then anyways.", "This is sad. This really is not a good reason to change your name. At least she can change it back when she's an adult if she wants. Well done for standing your ground OP", "I think they mean your stepmom", "Agreed... the part about the therapist really threw me off.\n\nOP, did you search his/her name on the Internet?", "It is and I love it. It feels cool to be part of something \"different\" in terms of what's normal in the US. Also makes me super proud to be part of the mom's passing down their name.", "She never said her name. And she came to the house so I don't know where she's supposedly based.", "Out of curiosity, when people in these countries that have hyphenated names get married, is there a \"rule of thumb\" they use to choose which of the two to use for their own hyphenated name with their new spouse? Do sons typically take the paternal surname part and daughters take the maternal surname to be their part of the new hyphenated name?", "I understand that. Even in the US we have a lot of people with hyphenated names. For me personally it is too long.", "I was hoping they meant that but I know some people can be weird about mom's giving their kids their last name. So I wanted to make sure.", "I wonder if it is a church 'therapist'?", "This is incredibly suspicious.  It doesn't sound like she's legit at all.  Even if she is she's not good. Any good therapist would tell you that you're in charge of your own identity.\n\nAlso you're NTA.", "To my knowledge not in France, it's a purely a personal choice.\nAnd you're limited to two names (which are not hyphenated).", "It's either this or someone who shouldn't be in the profession. Because it sounds like they just wanted to dismiss OPs feelings on the matter for them to \"fit in\" with the family.", "Yeah, the whole thing was off to me."]}
