She and my dad were married but she kept her last name and he kept his. Then when I was born I got my mom's last name. When I was 8 my mom died and when I was 11 my dad remarried.  My little sister is 13. My stepmother came into the marriage with three kids of her own. The older two have a different dad from her younger kid. Their dad's are deadbeats and my stepsiblings never knew them.\n\nMy dad and stepmother had a baby together last year. He has both their last names. My stepsiblings were upset when he got to match both dad and stepmother and they were upset dad didn't adopt them. So the suggestion was made for dad to adopt them and my stepmother to adopt me and my sister then we all take the hyphenated name \"dad's last name-stepmother's last name\". I said no to both and told them I didn't want to be adopted or to have my name changed. My sister said she didn't really want to but said if it was a big deal for dad she would agree. He thanked her.\n\nFor the next few months my dad and stepmother told me all the reasons they felt these changes were good and important. They brought a therapist in to speak to me and the therapist told me it would be okay to be adopted and to have the security my stepmother could provide if she were my legal mother.\n\nI never changed my mind and told them I still would not consent to the adoption.\n\nOnce they (sorta kinda maybe) accepted that they told me to consider hyphenating my last name at least. They said I could even have three. Keep my mom's if I really insist on it, but they don't know why I was making such a big deal out of it, and adding the hyphenated name as well. They said it would make addressing our whole family SO much easier and would mean a lot to everyone. My dad said it would be nice for both his kids to finally have his last name. My stepmother said it would be very symbolic for her, to feel like I have accepted her as a third parent and that it would mean I do want to be part of her and her kids' family. She told me how I feel about my last name and keeping it my mom's, is just as important to her that my sister and I have her name in there too. She told me she really loves me and to imagine how much happiness it would bring. She also said it would be less confusing for my half brother and my future half sister (she's pregnant again).\n\nI told them I did not want my name changed or added to. I told them it felt disrespectful to dismiss how important my last name is. I told them I am the one who has to live with the name and I don't want to take their new hyphenated name. My dad told me my sister was willing and didn't I want to match with her at least. I told him she doesn't even want to, she's doing it for him, which she made very clear when she agreed. But it's not something I would do for him.\n\nThey told me I should be more willing to compromise and my hard stance on this will be upsetting to my stepsiblings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703064965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mqrvd/aita_for_not_being_willing_to_hyphenate_my_last/", "score": 1521, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No disrespect to their step-father, he's a great guy, but I will always think a little less of her for that.", "I didn't take my husband's last name and neither of us chose to hyphenate (my last name is very long). I'm pregnant and my child will probably have my partner's last name and that's fine. Maybe if we have another they'll have mine? Plenty of biofamilies do not have the same last name.", "My youngest sibling\u2019s best friend recently changed her name along with her mother. The dad/husband was not good to either of them, and finally after 20-years left the man. The mom hadn\u2019t had a great relationship with her parents (they were in and out of her life), so they decided to make up their own last name.

When they protest and say their name is special let them make all their arguments and then say 'ok same'", "I'm 50, and my boyfriend and I are talking marriage.

Women do it all the time when they get married.\n\nMy youngest son changed his last name to mine when I adopted him at 14 (with his consent), and there haven\u2019t been any issues.

For example, in Georgia the child\u2019s consent is only required if they are 14 or older.", "We gave my son the choice in his last name when I adopted him.

That's one of the comforts I have is they cannot force this for me.", "Not all parents with different last names hyphenate their children's names. I mean, in the long run, continued hyphenation is impractical anyway, so somewhere down the line, someone's name will have to be cut short.", "Some, I guess. The fact neither my sister or me call her mom and the fact neither of us has the relationship with her that her kids have with dad. That could be making her jealous.", "Nah, the adoption was never an option for me. I would not want to be adopted by her, or anyone to be totally fair. But that was always a no. They did eventually let that go but now the name is where their focus is.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. My older son has my late wife\u2019s last name, and I would never dream of asking him to change it if I remarry. Good for you for standing up for yourself!", "Your name is your identity. It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are or who your family is. You alone control it. It\u2019s fantastic that has significant history from your mother\u2019s side, which makes it even more meaningful.

I have my fathers middle and last name. That part I kept when I married. My husband also have a similar setup in names that he kept and his half siblings don't share his name eirher. Our kid have been given a mix of our middle and last names because she is a mix of two families. That the kid and I don't share last name doesn't change anything about parental status or feelings between us.\n\nNTA. It is your legal name and they should respect that. Nobody should be forced to change their legal name against their wishes.

Strange that he didn\u2019t make the case then, especially when State laws make the father\u2019s name the default when parents are married (even if mother retains her maiden name).", "Check your State\u2019s laws.  For example, in Georgia a child\u2019s consent to a step-parent adoption is required if they are 14 or above.  Without said adoption, your name most likely can\u2019t be changed.", "I've got my mom's last name as well and my dad talked my half-sister (who I barely knew) into trying to convince me to change it to his/theirs. It's so frustrating and pointless because if it really mattered he wouldn't have waited 18yrs to ask, plus I'd made it known I never planned on changing my name since I was little and was told girls had to when they marry.\n\nI eventually got her to drop it by pointing out her kid didn't have its dad's last name so she was a massive hypocrite. If it was so important to both your dad and stepmother they'd have ensured their children had their respective last names at birth instead of making it a massive headache years later.", "A pushy church therapist who just tells you what to do to appease everyone is NOT a therapist. \n\nOffer a compromise...

Therapists are there to listen, reflect and guide self discovery.\n\nThat therapist was fake, whether they're fake in a church or fake outside of it. They're still full of shit.", "I suspect they are not real a therapist. I've been to a lot of therapy in my time and when I read that part about what they'd said I felt quite incensed. Of course it is OK to do it, the therapist failed to tell you that it is OK not to do it and help you make a choice you are sure about and at peace with. It does sound like you're already sure about your feelings on the matter, and I'm sorry you're being pressured and emotionally manipulated over your completely justified stance. \n\nYou're NTA, and I'm sorry you lost your mum so young, that's hard.", "Probably a friend of the stepmom. Seems stepmom wants to remove all reminders of your mom. I\u2019m so sorry.", "They will, and they'll call you Mrs Hislastname without checking, and go all shocked pikachu when you say you prefer Dr Mylastname...and then they'll still address christmas cards to Mr & Mrs Hisfirstname Hislastname", "The system is built to accept a last name change due to marriage. Changing your first name causes issues for sure, my wife had two years worth of problems from her first name change and I\u2019m never sure when she\u2019s going to need the court order for something. So for this AITA it\u2019s probably not a big deal bc it\u2019s last name and the kids are minors, but oof it can really suck outside of that situation lmao.", "I imagine it feels like they are trying to erase your mother.  \n\nKeep you mom\u2019s name.

Three names is ridiculous. Stick to your guns. Changing your name does not change your relationships. Why didn't your step-mom take your father's last name and then give it to all her kids? Oh yeah, because they wanted to respect their heritage. Such BS.", "Got it but it\u2019s a matrilineal tradition so should be your sister as well.", "yea probably, you guys don\u2019t owe her the same relationship her kids have with your dad tho, there\u2019s a huge difference between deadbeat parents and late ones and she needs to either understand that or stew in her own jealousy towards the beautiful soul that is your mom bc that\u2019s exactly what she signed up for when she married your dad and it\u2019s not fair for her to drag you into that jealous stew", "To be fair the therapist said being adopted would be ok, not that they must or should be adopted.  It's possible depending on how OP worded his objections, the therapist may have thought OP felt forced to keep the name and not be adopted because he owes it to his late mother, etc.", "What's funny is they keep saying it's no big deal. If it isn't a big deal, why are they making it one?", "My kids all had four names: first name, middle name, my birth name, their father\u2019s last name. \n\nFor unknown reasons, my mother-in-law didn\u2019t like my maiden name being one of their names. So when we had her christened at their church, she \u201cforgot \u201c one name. I just asked to have the baptismal certificate altered, she wasn\u2019t happy. I loved in when they as imply reprinted it with all four names and handed it to me", "That\u2019s an old tradition in the Southeast where kids (especially the first born) get the mother\u2019s maiden name as a middle name.  I have several cousins and uncles where that was the case.", "One of my high school classmates also had her mom's maiden name as her middle name. It was Lennox, and I thought it was a cool name!\n\nMy sister gave her daughter our mom's name as her middle name. My niece had a daughter and gave HER her great-grandmother's name as her middle name, as well. It means a lot, especially now that both of our parents have passed. \n\nThat same sister got divorced and went back to our last name. She was so happy when her driver's license had her maiden name on it again. We have 3 girls and a boy. The other sister has never been married, and neither have I, so all 4 of us have our original last name.", "While I might make the case for adding dad\u2019s in conjunction with her mother\u2019s.

But she's agreed to change it because of how much my dad wants us both to.", "Agreed.  That whole part sounded fishy to me. \n\nOP, at your age, nobody can force you to do anything.

I know that if I were in her shoes, I would be worried about disappointing everyone, so make sure you stress to her that it isn\u2019t \u201ctoo late\u201d to change her mind (this is a pretty huge decision after all) and make it clear that you\u2014as her big brother\u2014will back her up and not let your dad and stepmom pressure her into backing down.", "That's how it works here in Brazil!
