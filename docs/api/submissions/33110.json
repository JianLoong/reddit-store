I have absolutely no issues with her partner's kids, they're very sweet and everything is okay on that front, I just don't know them very well since they've only been part of the family for a year or so.\n\nToday, me and my partner (23F) proposed taking my niece and nephew out to the local wildlife park at the weekend, since we've been away for a few months and haven't spent time with them in a while so we thought it would be nice.\n\nMy sister was pretty against the idea, saying that it would be unfair for the other two to have to stay at home while their siblings got to go out and have fun, and everyone needs to come to terms with the fact that her family is bigger now and dividing the kids up is going to make things harder for them to deal with emotionally alongside their parents splitting up etc.\n\nAnd yknow what? She's right, and I completely see where she's coming from. But what's the alternative? I can't take all four of them out since there's not enough room in the car, and even if I could it would feel very strange to be taking the other two out myself without their dad there. Before my sister got into this relationship, me and my partner used to take her kids out quite a lot, to give her a break from single mumming and also just to spend time with them because we wanted to - I had a rough childhood growing up with just one adult (my mum) in my life and I want to make sure my niece and nephew have lots of safe people they can spend time with that aren't just their parents.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to separate them? I really do get where my sister is coming from, but on the other hand I don't think that it's reasonable to say that whoever wants to spend time with her kids has to deal with carting around all four of them.", "created_utc": 1702683605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jdo1d/aita_for_wanting_to_take_my_niece_and_nephew_out/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know their specific dynamics, but forcing them to do ALL the things they used to do WITH the new kids will only cause resentment.", "So, this is just an opinion. When I was 8, my mom died. My dad remarried to a, not so nice woman. Whenever I tried to get some time with my dad, it always ended up time with All the kids. Not just me. I got it that , yes we should be a family, but They didn't lose their mom, and he Wasn't their father. I never went with them when they vacationed with their father, but mine didn't seem to want to be My father. \n\nAll I needed was to know that he Was still my father despite the new family dynamic. IDK if this would make sense, but letting your niece and nephew know that they still have a place with you isn't a bad thing, is it? If you still did take everyone out too, why would it be so bad every once in awhile? In a new marriage, original children need reassurance too. So they won't feel they're getting lost in the merger.", "NAH.\n\nYour sister is correct; if all of the kids are there, they should all get to go on the outing. Her family has expanded and it\u2019s time to get to know her step-kids.\n\nBut you are also within your rights not to want to take four kids away for the weekend; that\u2019s a very big ask.\n\nSo you compromise. When your step-niblings are with their other parent, hang out with your biological niblings. When all four are with your sister, plan local day trips for everyone. Maybe have your sister or another family member help with transportation, since your car isn\u2019t big enough.", "NTA.  Forcing children to pretend to be identical is no way to raise them.  It's lazy and self-indulgent parenting.  Your sister should instead do something nice with her stepkids, and work on setting up times all of you can spend time together.", "NTA. The step kids have relatives of their own they don't have to share with the niece and nephew. \n\nYes to trying to blend families, but both sets have different circumstances and are at the age where they need to learn that it's okay that Jack and Jill have these people and Sue and Sam have these. Does your sister expect her step kids' maternal relatives to take her kids too? \n\nHaving been in the step kids' shoes, I understood that stepdad's family wasn't mine. They could invite me along if they wanted, but they didn't have to.", "NTA.  Add to your logistical issues:  Four kids ranging from 4 to 8 in age are going to be a friggin' handful.  The older kids are not quite old enought to help keep an eye on the younger kids.  \n\nYou and your sister need to come to some kind of arrangement for taking all four kids out together on occasion, probably involving both you and your sister taking them together.  \n\nAnother option is to change things up on occasion.  Maybe sometimes you do an activity for the older kids, and sometimes an activity for the younger kids.", "Nta\n\nThis problem come up frequently in amitheasshole actually. Parent with your sister's idea. And children living with that reality. \n\nYou know what the kids say? They want the separate activities. They want time not \"with everyone\". And they grow to really resent their parents not understanding that individual time is equally important to \"group time\". \n\nSo don't feel bad. All 4 kids are not related to you, and you don't have the same relationship. If you sisters really wanted what was best for the kids, she would help you build a relationship with her new children. While also giving you time Al ng with the 2. Saying \"we are family\" is different than actually doing the work to be a family, unfortunately. \n\nBesides, if you take 2 that gives her the opportunity to have quality time with the other children. Doesn't she want to ensure each of her children get the individual attention they need? If they are always together, they're all being neglected emotionally. Again, it's the easy way out rather than really  'building a family\".", "NTA\n\n I'm tired of all the \"i married, here are my stepchildren, treat them the same as the kids you've met since birth, despite the fact that they're strangers\"..... this sub is weird about stepfamilies", "If all 4 is too much, you could take the two eight year olds out one day, and take the two five year olds out the next time. There are activities that are age related. That would give you a chance to form a bond with your new niblings. One child you know well would be there, so it would be less awkward than taking just steps and just bios .They are young enough for you to build a connection with, but that won\u2019t happen unless you are willing to spend time with them. I used to do \u201cspecial days\u201d with my kids to get one on one time, and they definitely understood taking turns. For me, bonus kids are awesome.", "NTA -- that is a lot of kids for you, and don't their stepsiblings have their own family.  Just tell sis, either your neice and nephew or no one", "NAH. You both have valid points.", "Nta parents need to find another strategy because it can\u2019t always be fair. I think they need to start making kids okay with sometimes they don\u2019t get to do everything and step and half siblings are going to have certain advantages. I think we need to focus on helping kids deal with their emotional around this over banning anything that isn\u2019t for the group. It\u2019s just the new normal of blended family\u2019s. \n\nIf I have neice/nephew I\u2019ve known for 8 -5 years  I\u2019m going to have a closer relationship with them then children I met (guessing) maybe a year ago. It isn\u2019t fair to deny the first too the closeness so the other 2 don\u2019t feel bad.", "It\u2019s just so hard blending families\u2026 I really feel for the kids. I have no answer on who TA is. It\u2019s just sad", "YTA you know how you\u2019d get to know them better? By taking them with. You excluded kids that\u2019s just AH.", "In the mildest of ways, YTA. You're *aaaaaalmost* not one because you recognize and admit that  it's not fair. But you couldn't quite make it over the \"what's the alternative hurdle.\"\n\nTake some time and brainstorm: Maybe take all four of them to a park that you can walk to. Or... I'm assuming your sister has a vehicle that will fit both parents and all four kids. Offer to swap vehicles with your sister for the day so you can take all of them to the wildlife park. This would probably be safer anyway, because that way you can use the car seats that they already have installed in that vehicle for the kids.", "YTA.  Life has changed, and in the interest of trying to foster family harmony you need to try and include the other two children.  Perhaps the parents could drive all four to the nature park or whatever activity you choose and you could meet them there.  Don't be the person the stepkids grow to despise because you excluded them.", "Your sister had 2 children and you were able to handle 2 children, so you had an active relationship with them.  Your sister now has 4 children and that is too many for you to handle on your own.  If you want to have a relationship with your sister's children now, you have to have a relationship with all 4 of them now.  Yes, YTA for wanting to take only 2 of her 4 children to the animal park.\n\nIt sounds as though you need to include your sister in your outings with her children, since you are unable to handle and accommodate 4 children without further assistance and need time to get to know her 2 additions better.

Taking out only two of the children could create a rift between the four kids and cause hurt within the household dynamic. 2# your sister is trying her best to think of what is right for all of her children equally, not just the ones she gave birth to. You might not realize this, but your sister might feel hurt that it seems you don\u2019t really consider her step children as your niece and nephew. 3# if your sister had all four children biologically and they were your nieces and nephews through blood relation. Would you still only take two of them out with you or would you try to make it work for the four of them ? \u2026 I would suggest if your sister and her husband are okay with you taking all four kids out, figure out a way to make it work, or figure out something else you can do with all four of them.", "here's the thing though, sister's family may have expanded but that does not mean her children's family has. the relationship her ave with her new spouse and his kids is entirely separate from the one she has, and removing one on one time with a family member they saw often and likely care for is a good way to make sure that that relationship is wholly negative", "Yes - this is how we worked things in our blended family, too.", "One at a time is also a good arrangement.
