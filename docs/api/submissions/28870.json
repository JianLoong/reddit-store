I will think about how I would procced to do that 1 last thing in my mind. So I can relate to why you did all of these things before talking to your wife. You would have been sorta absentminded with her if there is stuff to do in the back of your mind - likely past experience tells you that spending time with her is enjoyable and will take a few hours and then when it gets dark - you're now stuck for the rest of the night with the thought of getting the chore done. However, she's your partner. She came early to presumable talk with you and probably engage in some form of intimacy. She was excited to see you and felt you were not excited to see her. Sucks that you missed out on some fries - but as a suggestion, just Doordash yourself some fries and sweep her off her feet in the meantime instead of being upset. Take her into the shower with you, be proactive in showing her that you love her and she'll be happy. Relearn to bring romance back into your relationship with her and she will appreciate it. You will both be much happier.", "Wtf are people saying?? Your wife offered to make some food. She said that to you ASSUMING you would be in to eat with her. How much food did she make to share? Obviously not enough that one person can devour it. Look, yes you said one chore. And then you got distracted and did some more. It took one hour. That\u2019s not a lot of time. It\u2019s not her responsibility, but if she cared so bad she could have said hey foods ready and then you join her. But you lost track of time, a reasonable amount of time may I add, and then she\u2019s like fuck you and eats all the food that was made to share? That\u2019s so stupid. I feel like people don\u2019t act human on this sub. Mistakes happen, things pop up, and not everything that is super important to you is super important to everyone else. How early did you get home? How much do you guys hangout already? Like come on, honestly. He takes care of two chores and then cleans his car real quick and he\u2019s an ASSHOLE?? Not his wife, but people on this sub - grow the fuck up. Literally if my girlfriend was like I\u2019m going to clean up the office real quick and I\u2019m like okay sweet I\u2019ll make some food and when food gets ready\u2026 I get mad she\u2019s not instantly there and eat it all?? Like what? I\u2019ll go be like hey foods ready if you WANT to eat and then go eat. And if I wanted her to eat with me?? Crazy but guess what - I\u2019ll say \u201ccome eat with me babe\u201d. Instantly she\u2019ll melt for that, and join me. You know why? Communication. And yes op could have communicated. But again, if she lost track cleaning the office, then putting some laundry away, and feeding her fucking gerbil for all I know I WOULDN\u2019T GET MAD. Why am I getting mad that she\u2019s doing what she normally does on her days, I came home early, I can give her grace that she forgot/not normal schedule/just distracted. I would again be like hey foods ready, come eat! \n\nand while the long message above may not portray it, it might be because I generally don\u2019t give two shits about stuff that doesn\u2019t matter in the long run. And just to add an extra point also, for most of my life I was told food was ready. I don\u2019t hawk or ask if foods ready, I wait. And when it\u2019s done, they say and I\u2019m like awesome I\u2019m starving and get in line. That\u2019s a personal anecdote but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s super weird to wait until it\u2019s told it\u2019s ready.

I got annoyed with my husband the other day because I spent a bunch of time making a good breakfast while he chilled in bed, and then I told him breakfast was ready but he went to make the bed instead\u2026 I jokingly (but not obviously with some truth) asked him to stop because\u2026 \u201cwhy did start a chore when I said breakfast was ready\u2026?\u201d And his response was \u201coh, I was just doing this while you were finishing up\u201d\u2026 but the bed takes time to make and breakfast was literally ready.\n\nHe does this a lot. And we talked about it after. But I didn\u2019t eat his breakfast or get super passive aggressive about it. So I agree the wife was in the wrong with her actions but perhaps it was built up resentment and they both need to communicate for the future.", "THANK YOU", "A responsible adult who thinks his chores and his responsibilities are the only ones that matter. He knew when the food would be ready, but kept adding \u201cone more thing\u201d, because his jobs are more important than hers.", "That is true.", "They didn\u2019t agree on how long he would work.", "Or just told her. Hey I got the washer out so I'm gonna clean the tires. Can you let me know when the food is done? \n\nTada! Communication.", "He said he was going to.power wash the steps.", "Yep. That\u2019s why he needed to make his expectations more clear."]}
