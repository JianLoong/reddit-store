On the flight I was on, I was sitting in the aisle seat while someone else was in the window.\n\nDuring the inflight service, the flight attendant was serving the window seat passenger a glass of orange juice when she somehow lost her grip and spilled it on me. There was no turbulence or rough air, she just simply seemed to miss her grip.\n\nAnyway, it got all over my white shirt and she tried to profusely apologize, and I interrupted her and said \"just stop.\" That's all I said. I hadn't yelled at her or anything like that. I had an important event to attend not long after the flight. This was a day trip, and normally I don't pack extras for day trips, but this time I did bring an extra shirt just in case.\n\nI went to the bathroom to change while she cleaned off the seat. Shortly before landing, the window passenger leaned over and told me that \"mistakes happen\" and that I didn't have to be so dismissive.\n\nI don't think I came off as rude, but idk. Was I the asshole in that situation? I didn't say anything mean or yell.\n\nEdit: Okay I see now that I was unnecessarily rude. As I said in a comment, I was also just very stressed. I'd not been able to sleep the night before, this was an early flight, and my driver to the airport cancelled last minute. But I guess that doesn't excuse me not being nice. I'm sure she was stressed too, and I didn't have to be so unkind. I won't act like that again if a similar situation ever arises.\n\nEditFinal: I get it. I'm the asshole. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried to make excuses. I don't have the mental bandwidth for this post anymore.

You don't just ruin someone's shirt, especially on the job. But mistakes happen and she did apologize, so she did what she could.\n\nYou weren't especially rude. I mean, saying \"just stop\" to an apology signifies you're mad and don't wanna hear it, and just wanna get on with your day. Which.... Is normal, and your right, to someone who spills a sugary drink on your professional shirt. It doesn't feel good, but well, she did fuck up. That's just the consequences of her mistake. Saying stuff like \"don't worry about it\" would have been *nice* of you. People here seem to conflate nice with basic decency. You were decent, just not nice. You weren't an AH either. Didn't make it a big deal or insult her or anything.\n\nYou are under no obligation to listen to someone's apology for their professional mistake that inconveniences you.

Would it have been better to have said something like \"Just stop, I have a change of clothes it's not a huge deal.\"? Sure probably. Are you obligated to make the FA feel better for their screw up, as innocent as it maybe, no. It didn't sound like you were mean, just curt. Taking everything at face value, you did nothing warranting an apology.", "Unpopular opinion apparently but NTA.\nWhen a mistake happens I don't need someone hovering over me and giving me the extra burden of making them feel better.

Yes, mistakes happen, and she was apologetic, but her apologies didn't un-spill the drink.

The fact that over half the population probably would of freaked out at her and caused a scene means that your fellow passenger is oversensitive. I am 100% positive that the flight attendant herself was relived that you were just a little annoyed because let's face it we live in a time where people are making complete asses of themselves and ruining everyone else's time & experience over shit that is way less annoying than having a glass of OJ spilled all over you.", "NAH - Accidents happen.  You were annoyed and asked her to just stop, perhaps you were a bit short, but not aggressive.  You'd rather deal with it yourself at that point and just miffed that you had to.   Understandable.  The other passenger didn't need to add their two cents at the end, but whatever, it is what it is.", "NAH", "NAH.  You were irritated and rightfully so.  You didn't say anything rude, you just weren't in the headspace to accept an apology right then and there.", "NAH.

OP was annoyed (and justifiably so), and didn't want to deal with her. OP didn't yell at her, didn't report her or try and get her in trouble, or anything like that.

Sometimes people make simple mistakes then go heavily overboard on the apology. You could\u2019ve flipped out but didn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it", "NTA She fucked up. Accidents absolutely do happen, but you were under no obligation whatsoever to alleviate her guilt for that screw up by listening to an apology that would have done nothing to rectify the situation.

While it is best to accept an apology (which amounts to forgiveness) of an unintentional act that causes you some level of inconvenience or harm... **there is no reason you have to**. Now, had you done more (eg. throw a tantrum, complain to supervisor, etc.), that would put you closer to the asshole territory depending on the degree of carelessness on the part of the flight attendant and the degree of resultant harm to you.  What if you were going to an important job interview without an extra change of clothing (maybe because you didn't have another good shirt)?  The harm done to you would have been significant, and the only reason this wasn't so was because of dumb luck.  But all you did was to express your irritation at the inconvenience (maybe harm, don't know if your shirt was permanently stained) and shutting-the-door on forgiveness.  That is not the best outcome in terms of smoothing things over socially, but neither is getting soaked with orange juice.\n\nI do think your window passenger is an asshole, though.  This person wanted the best experience for him/herself in the form of kumbaya over an instance of conflict that didn't involve harm to him/herself, and just wanted to you to accept the harm that was done to you.  This person wasn't empathetic... because he/she obviously didn't try to empathize with both sides of the conflict, and had the balls to actually guilt you with a self-interested, single-sided consideration masked as an impartial judge of social propriety.\n\nIn case it needs to be said, the flight attendant is definitely NTA as well.  Conflict, harm, and blame can exist without anybody actually being an AH.   Much of it comes down to motivation.   And the only unjustifiably self-centered motivation is that of the window passenger for giving you shit about being irritated and not wanting to hear an apology.", "NTA at all. Sometimes an apology doesn't cut it, and you don't have to falsely accept it. Being honest is more important. She made a mistake, she didn't came up with any means to fix it.

I know that you being stressed does not justify rudeness but hey, anyone will be annoyed if they have drinks spilled on them even if it happened mistakenly. I mean, it is uncomfortable to say the least.", "NAH\n\nNeither of you are. Like you said, you didn't yell and you didn't say anything rude. Yes, mistakes happen. I'm sure 9/10 times, you are more kind when people make mistakes. But not being overly kind and forgiving is not rude.\n\nJust like I tell my kids, you should apologize if you do something wrong. But the other person is not obligated to accept it.", "NTA. Accidents happen, but you also have a right to be upset, what happened to you stinks. You were not particularly rude, you just didn\u2019t want to continue the interaction.", "NAH.\n\nMistakes do happen, that's true.\n\nBut the person who made the mistake is not entitled to have the wronged part hear their apologies and accept them just to make the one who made the mistake feel better. \n\nI believe apologies are only valid with reparation. If what the person suffering the consequences of the mistake needs is to be left alone and not put up with the social etiquette of apologies and whatnots, then I leave that person alone.\n\nPeople don't always have to be graceful and understanding and be on a good mood when they are suffering the consequences of other people's mistakes.

She had an off moment, accidents do happen, but there is a reason that drinks are passed on a tray and not by hand... so in fact, it was her error on all sides... later the head steward came over and apologized and said the flight attendant was really upset... I said why? I wasn't rude, she said oh,  I know, she said you were gracious, but she is really upset... ??? \n\nWhy are we constantly having to apologize for other people's accidents, mistakes or errors. Own it.

It\u2019s so aggressive and unnecessary.\n\nIf you\u2019d listened to her apology, maybe she would\u2019ve offered you an airline credit or a complimentary drink or something. Instead you.l cut her off and dismissed her like she\u2019s beneath you. \n\nYou had the right to be upset, don\u2019t get me wrong, but how you responded to it made you an AH. She certainly isn\u2019t one for making a mistake and apologizing for it. She\u2019s clumsy. That was all.", "YTA - it was clearly a mistake and these things happen. Was it inconvenient? Absolutely. But she immediately started apologizing and you curtly cut her off and stormed off to the restroom. You should have assured her that you knew it was a mistake and that you accepted her apology. People in the service industry are absolutely shit on by people and that seems to include you. Reevaluate how you talk to people.", "YTA.\n\nAs someone who works in the service industry, your cold dismissive response would have bothered me all day.

I get the frustration but it was an honest mistake from someone who is underpaid and has to deal with people\u2019s bullshit all the time and you had an extra shirt.

On the flight I was on, I was sitting in the aisle seat while someone else was in the window. \n\nDuring the inflight service, the flight attendant was serving the window seat passenger a glass of orange juice when she somehow lost her grip and spilled it on me. There was no turbulence or rough air, she just simply seemed to miss her grip. \n\nAnyway, it got all over my white shirt and she tried to profusely apologize, and I interrupted her and said \"just stop.\" That's all I said. I hadn't yelled at her or anything like that. I had an important event to attend not long after the flight. This was a day trip, and normally I don't pack extras for day trips, but this time I did bring an extra shirt just in case. \n\nI went to the bathroom to change while she cleaned off the seat. Shortly before landing, the window passenger leaned over and told me that \"mistakes happen\" and that I didn't have to be so dismissive. \n\nI don't think I came off as rude, but idk.

The first thought coming to my mind is if the apology is for the benefit of the giver or the receiver. Because if OP is socially obliged to accept the apology then it's an onus on the receiver and that sounds absurd. What I believe you're saying is that an apology is for the benefit of building decorum and return to normal in society. So it is for the benefit of neither, it is a reset. It's an interesting idea although I find it hard to agree with. Especially since there is definitely such a thing as an apology for the benefit of the receiver.\n\nThe implication of this being dude it's just a shirt, no need to get your panties in a twist. And to me the principles that apply ate OP doesn't owe anyone a feeling. In addition, if it was such a slap in the face then she should forgive OP in the same vein we are saying she has a right to OP's forgiveness.

No. \n\nDid she do what she should have? Yes. It was an accident, she was genuinely sorry, and apologized honestly.\n\nWere you an asshole for responding with a neutral cessation of her numerous apologies? No. A wronged party is not obligated to make the offender feel better about wronging them.

The flight attendant made a mistake, she apologized, you told her to stop. That's it. You didn't even make a fuss.

For me, spilling something on someone else makes me feel far, FAR worse than being spilled on.
