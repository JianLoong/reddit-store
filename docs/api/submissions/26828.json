I was not prepared for what I would experience! The colors of discharge \ud83e\udd22 and the amount of blood on the women\u2019s underwear looked like a crime scene was cleaned with em.. nearly 25% of the women\u2019s underwear would NOT make it to the first wash! Most were directly disposed of, and not in the proper manner, this was the 90\u2019s and they had me bare handed separating washable underwear from the garbage pile.. that shit should\u2019ve turned me gay!

But if it was a mistake then she would've apologized for forgiving. And not accused op of being disgusted by her instead.", "This. Everyone is jumping way too quickly on the GF being disgusting. He also only mentioned it happening twice - once with a pad, once with a tissue. I\u2019m guessing the bin is far from the toilet and she has twice now put an item down mid toilet usage and then forgotten to pick it back up and place in the bin on her way out.

So are you saying my bodily fluids in a wad on the floor are GROSS or something???\"", "Or thought she tossed it in the garbage but missed? I live alone and even I make sure that stuff makes it securely into the garbage bin.", "This is not a mistake, and as a woman, I can say, \"Yes, it is disgusting.\" No woman leaves a bloody sanitary product by mistake. \n\nYou aren't being grossed out by the period, just the fact that she is being completely unhygienic. \n\nI have been married most of my adult life and have grown kids, and NO ONE in my house has ever had to clean up my period trash.", "That was brilliant!", "Saves toilet paper; newspapers are more absorbent and help reduce any smells.", "Maybe she\u2019s insecure. Her reaction wasn\u2019t ideal, but I\u2019m not convinced she did it on purpose, because she doesn\u2019t do it all the time.

Who does that?  Oops, never mind, his gf does.", "Yeah! All of a sudden people started assuming there was no trash can!!! Ugh. Reading skills are a bit lacking here!

Do you think nobody will see it or accidentally touch it just because there\u2019s a lid?", "Both because many people don't want to see blood (or snotty tissue, or whatever else winds up in there), and because used period products can smell not so great, so just like with a kitchen garbage a lid helps. Old blood isn't really the scent most people are going for in their bathroom.", "Appearances, smells, germs, pets/kids rooting through garbage. If you have a cat and keep the cat's litter box in the bathroom (so people do), it's also good to have a lid.  A small garbage bin/pail with a lid, especially with a foot pedal to open it, is nice to have.", "Cum?", "That is what I said! As in tampons will\u2026 clog the toilet. I don\u2019t flush any of mine.

Why did he write he had to make a bucket just to do that, im confused what the bucket that he had to made was for?", "I have left some pads out there by mistake lol but that only happened twice because I was in a hurry and in auto mode. It happens sometimes.", "Dude, people forget. Are you perfect? I forgot it like 2 times in the last 3 years and my boyfriend is not making a fucking post about this.
