Everybody can have a slip up and forget to throw something away if they're in a rush or tired or it fell down and they didn't notice. All you had to do was remind your GF and I'm sure she would've gladly cleaned it up. It sounds like you shamed your GF because her bodily fluids accidentally touched your floor.\n\nThis doesn't sound like an ongoing or repeated issue, have some understanding and empathy and I'm sure you guys will be able to work it out. There's always some teething issues when you first move in with someone else.", "Ok, so, *one* time she left a pad on the floor - that's probably a mistake.

Do you have a pet?", "YTA initially wanted to side with you but the way you are going about this is all wrong. First off it's only happened twice. People use way more than 2 pads or tampons on their periods sounds like it may be genuine mistakes and or miscommunication. She may just be embarrassed by her mistake.

Could she be putting things on the floor while sitting on the toilet, intending to toss them in the bin but then she gets distracted and forgets? Are the tissues and pads close to the bin like she tossed them in that direction but they landed on the floor (I toss qtips and floss into a bin in my bathroom and am forever walking over to pick them up off the floor cause the bin is kind of too far). Regardless the reason, you definitely aren't the AH for asking her to be more considerate but the fact that you think there might be a misunderstanding leads me to think maybe something else is going on?

Regardless, it should have been wrapped in TP or the wrapper from the new pad.\n\nOtherwise: I cannot fathom a reason why one wouldn\u2019t use a trash can that\u2019s right there.\n\nETA: Her reaction may have been because she\u2019s embarrassed she forgot and she didn\u2019t want to have to explain the above. Still not cool to leave it there, but a lot less *intentionally* gross.\n\nHaving been in bathrooms at houses with only guys living there and old restrooms with no sanitary product boxes in the stalls, I can say it\u2019s really obnoxious to have the trash can far from the toilet and it just makes things more of a hassle.", "NTA\nShe's disgusting to me, and probably everybody else reading this.
