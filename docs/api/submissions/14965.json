Those other children are going to be continuing to live their lives, play with their friends, go to their sporting events and social activities the same as they would without the girl visiting.  OR mother is going to force her children to include the girl, even though she is likely several years older.  Neither of these is a good situation.  Now that the girl is a teen, interacting with the younger siblings is particularly unsatisfying.  She wants to spend her time with people her own age. No matter how much the mother wants to see the girl, this visit is a disruption to normal life for everyone.  It is awkward for everyone and very isolating for the girl.  \n\nThis was difficult for me as a teen, when the visits included shorter trips at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Spring break.  I can't imagine how unpleasant it is when you only see these people once a year.  Also, my perspective is that of a child who knew both of her parents and just had one of them move far away in the same country when I was quite young.  I can't even imagine the resentment I would have toward my mother if she had sent me to a foreign country to live with a total stranger when I was 8 years old!", "Actually it depends on child's residence. In the us if a custody order is not in place then the parent who has the child the majority of the time has full custody. In the US for this to count the child had to reside with this parent more then 6 months", "Also, even if he goes by his verbal agreement, he admits he broke that agreement.", "Except it's not dad it's the daughter making these choices so you're incorrect. The court will ask the daughter what she wants. It's also strange that you dance around my replies and only reply to 1 sentence. I feel like your feelings are getting 8nvolved here? Has this happened to you?", "By alienating her from her mother, I don\u2019t necessarily mean not sending her for their agreed upon visits. I mean not speaking disparagingly of her, making her available to speak on the phone as often as mom wanted to, etc. From dad\u2019s other responses here it sounds like he doesn\u2019t think much of mom and this attitude could\u2019ve easily been picked up by a child.\n\nWhen parents themselves don\u2019t get along it\u2019s extremely important that they make a distinction between their own relationship with each other and the child\u2019s relationship with both parents. For example, a bad husband is not necessarily a bad father.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you or the op are but in the US children at that age can address the court and state their desire but the court will decide if the mother is entitled to time with her child and what the father\u2019s obligations are as far as compliance."]}
