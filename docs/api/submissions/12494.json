My father being the upstanding church member he was divorced her. While she was in treatment. It broke my mom. I don't really remember much except her crying and then her funeral. I have no medical training or anything like that. I'm 17.  But I swear she just gave up. \n\nMy father married less than a year after the divorce while my mom was still in treatment. He had a daughter with his wife when I was eight. I have never considered his wife to be related to me and his daughter is not my sister. \n\nThey forced me to interact with her and watch her but unless I was forced I wasn't going to do it. \n\nThe four of us were in a car accident in February. I was injured and I just got out of the hospital. My father died and his wife is still unconscious. His daughter was not badly injured and has been staying with her maternal grandparents. I asked my dad's parents if I could stay with them and they said they didn't have room for both of us.  I was fine with that but they were not. They think she needs me. \n\nSo I called my mom's brother and I moved in with my mom's parents. They also do not want her in their house. It is hard because I have not seen them much since my mom died but we are starting to get along. I'm seeing all my cousins and other relatives from that side for the first time in a long while. \n\nI'm going to have to postpone going to college for at least a year while I rehab. I have money for school from my mom and my grandparents are okay with me staying here. \n\nSorry I just realized how much I built everything up. I will sum up the issue. \n\nMy father's family is saying that I'm being a bad sister to my father's daughter. That she is scared and alone. I can't bring myself to care. I remember wanting to see my grandparents but my father wouldn't nlet me because they hated him. Now I'm somewhere that my mom isn't a taboo subject. I'm not happy.

I can't blame you for resenting your dad for what he did. So much for being together in *sickness* and in health. That was really weak on his part.\n\nTo the question at hand: your half-sister, whether you care or not, is not your responsibility - it's that of the adults in your life, whether it's her mom or the grandparents at your dad's side. Try not to let it bother you that they're trying to shift their responsibility onto you, a child. You're still a teen, and you're not her parent - even if your father (and his now widow) pushed you to. You really need to take care of no. 1, that's you. You need to get back to full health and when it's time for college, you still wouldn't have time for your half-sister.\n\nI wish you good luck, and a lot of strength in a tough time (even if you didn't care as much for your dad anymore, it can still impact your mental health now that he passed away).", "Wow, you are deffo NTA.

(I can be very Bhopal and white though).\n\nUltimately though, you may have a chance to build a relationship with your step sister, and considering you've lost your mom and dad, you may need this kind of support later in life if you don't have much other family.\n\nI would say do what makes you happy but also keep in mind that she is innocent in all of this, she didn't ask to be brought into that situation, just like you didn't. But if seeing her means you get all the toxicity of her family, then you have to consider is it worth it?\n\nI've found that it's much easier on your own soul to try to forgive people for things as and anger or hatred can really do you more damage, and you're the innocent one so don't want you to go through any of that. I'm not saying this is the case but I'm just putting myself in that situation and thinking how I would feel. It's hard to forgive, but the thing to remember is you forgive to put your soul easier, not theirs.

You yourself are just recovering.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nHowever, your half-sister IS your sister whether you like it or not and I would urge you not to take out your rightfully-held anger towards your father out on her.\r  \n\r  \nIt's not the child's fault, it's your father's fault that he abandoned your mother to cancer.", "Nta. None of this is her fault, but it\u2019s not yours either.", "Ehhh, borderline.   Dad was definitely the AH.\nBut the sister is still OPs sister, she is 9 and all alone at this point and likely has looked up to OP her whole life.\n\nIt's tough but don't take out the deserved anger for your dad/step mom on your half sister.\nThat said balance trying to be a sister with living where OP can be happy, each with maternal grandparents makes sense.", "You are a really strong person.

You're a minor and it's not your job to raise your sister.  There are adults in this situation who need to sort out care for your sister.  That said, please don't blame your sister for your father's actions.  She's not the one who divorced your mom and she's going through a very tough time now, too.  You've got to take care of yourself and rehab, but please also try to be somewhat sympathetic to your sister, too.

And legally and biologically she Is your sister. Half at least. Your blaming and punishing her for something your dad did. And now shes gone through the same loss of a father as you did.

Do you want this young girl, who IS your half sister, and also lost your father, to go through that pain and trauma alone. You shouldnt be her SOLE provider in any way though. She definitely needs to be placed with family or a couple who can lovingly and financially support her. \n\nYou can. Thats fine...but think about that.", "NTA\n\nright now, you need love and care and no guilt at all. You are amazing and a survivor and I am glad you are working on yourself. \n\n\nMy only suggestion would be to get your paternal fame to arrange a visitation for your half sister. Not so you can care for her (which i am sure they want)  just so you 2 can see each other once a month or so. You might not need it now, but she does...and ijnthe future, you never know what will happen. So being kind and giving a small amount of visit time is a small concession that could lead to benefits for all.", "I'll get downvoted but oh well, I feel like YTA becasue your valid resentment against your dad affected how you treat your sister (not talking about after the accident, but her whole life), what your dad did wasn't her fault and yet you basically ignored her unless you were forced to interact with her because of your dad's actions.
