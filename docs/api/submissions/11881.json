When I got there, she was sitting doing nothing, and I greeted her and told her about my dress and how I wanted it fixed to fit me better. She says okay and gets a phone call. She told me to wait for her to finish talking so we can continue with measurements and stuff, she proceed to talk for about 20 minutes, laughing and making jokes with whoever was on the phone and when she was done she told me she has closed shop and I should come back next time. I asked her why she didn't tell me anytime during the call or even before the call that she had closed for the day. She proceeded to tell me how young people have no patience and that she had to wait for her elders to finish talking before she'd get her things done, i told her that during that 20 minutes that she was talking, I could have gone to fix my dress elsewhere and that it was very rude and unprofessional to make me wait knowing very well that she wouldn't do anything for me, then I left. \n\nLast night, my mum came home angry at me, saying that the seamstress said I insulted her because she said she couldn't fix my dress because she didn't have thread of the colour of my dress, and that I should go and apologise to her.
