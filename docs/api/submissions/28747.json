I find tracking calories to be tedious, and never was a big foodie so as a result I\u2019ve lapsed into eating the same foods almost daily, and that works for me even if it\u2019s \u2018boring\u2019. My diet on a usual day consists of oatmeal with fruit/nuts, eggs, protein shakes, and vegetables. \n\nMy girlfriend says she feels uncomfortable by how healthy I eat. She\u2019s very healthy herself, but a foodie, and tends to cook/eat a lot more elaborate meals than I do. She says my daily intake makes her feel I\u2019m secretly judging her for eating less healthy than I am.\n\nI\u2019m not, because what works works. If she\u2019s able to eat what she likes and still manage to feel and look great, then by all means. Same goes for me: if I\u2019m able to meet my goals, and not get tired of what may seem a boring diet, then also I think that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet. I don\u2019t mind doing so once or twice a week, but doing so every day would be detrimental to my goals, so I declined. \n\nThis made her angry, and she said I was an AH for being inconsiderate.

However, some food for thought (sorry, couldn\u2019t resist):\n\n- Do you frequently talk about your diet or make comments about how or why you eat the way you do? (Comments like \u201coh I can\u2019t possibly eat *that* because then *this* will happen to me\u201d, or anything similar)\n\n- Do you eat your separate meals together or do you eat alone at different times?\n\n- Do you talk about food in a way that makes it seem like you think it\u2019s silly that other people place importance on it?\n\n- Is the food she is making special to her in a cultural way?\n\n- Do you comment on her food, exercise routine, body type, or anything related to her physical form or dietary habits?\n\n- Does she come from a background of food insecurity, or otherwise have past trauma with things related to diet or exercise?\n\n- Do you take her out to dinners or have elaborate meals because it\u2019s important to her, even if it isn\u2019t to you?\n\n- Since you live together, how is food paid for? Is it possible that she feels guilty for spending more on food you aren\u2019t eating out of a shared budget?\n\nI think you need to sit down and really hash this out together. Even if this is just 100% her own insecurities things likely cannot continue in this pattern long term. Neither of you should have to change your diet but you do need to come to some sort of understanding.", "NtA, tell her stop being insecure and ridiculous. food is fuel and diet is extremely personal, tell her you won't compromise the comfortability of what you put in your body simply because she feels unwarranted shame. your health is your own, she won't feel the effects of your altered diet, you will", "NTA.\n\n>asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet\n\nImagine the reaction if you said this to her.", "NTA. You get to decide what you eat. It's your choice whether to be flexible on that.\n\nIf you can't be flexible, though, be prepared for the possibility that it might end up being a deal-breaker for her. If sharing her love of food is important to her in a relationship, or if your diet triggers body image issues for her, it might just be one of those situations where you're incompatible.", "So you're being an AH for being inconsiderate, but she is in the right for being inconsiderate?\n\nI don't understand people...\n\nNTA imo...", "NTA I seriously don\u2019t get the YT. Why does she feel the need of controlling what you eat? You sound pretty laid back! It\u2019s not like you\u2019re forcing her to do anything g so why does she think she has the right to tell you how you eat? \n\nI feel like a talk is needed for this to work out. As you said, you do you and she can do whatever she wants! It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t ever eat together, you just have to each eat what you want to eat.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA You're an adult and can feed yourself however you want. \n\nThat being said , I love cooking for my love, and I love fancy dinner dates where we can dress up and try new foods, especially if we're traveling.  I'd be sad if I didn't have that with my partner, and it might be a deal breaker . I dated someone with a similar \" boring\" diet and what ended up happening was I did everything I wanted with someone else until I realized that I was missing out by not having that in common with my partner .", "NTA. \n\nshe seems to have her own insecurities about it. as long as you aren't forcing her to follow your diet, you aren't in the wrong. like you said, what works works.", "How many of you \"yta\" folk would be willing to allow their partner to dictate something as minor as what you eat and not consider that a \"red flag\" that indicates you need to \"dump the asshole\" for his/her lack of respect?\n\nSome of you are basing your \"asshole\" judgments on whether you agree that it's weird to do what he does rather than if doing what he does is disrespectful and makes him an asshole.", "Nta, no way, don't let someone force you to do something you don't enjoy", "NTA assuming youre really not judging her or telling her what to do at any point. \n\nHer insecurities are for *her* to work on, she cant demand you change up your life beacause of them\n\nI would think of making an exit, ppl who expect others to change & take the joy out of their lives to cater to their insecurities are the worst.", "NTA. It seems like this is an insecurity of hers. I know a few people who had comments made about their eating habits in the past and are now insecure and hyper aware of the possibility of people judging them in regards to eating. Go easy on her. There\u2019s clearly a reason she\u2019s bothered by this and there\u2019s a fair few comments here that seem to be lacking the other side\u2019s perspective and talking shit about her. Empathy and understanding is the way forward and helping her get to the root of the issue will hopefully help begin to dispel the insecurity.", "I don't think she wants you to break your diet. She thinks you are entering Ed territory.\n\nMost ppl eating for survival but also for pleasure.\n\nThose like you that don't care much about food pleasure usually just eat so they won't die and foods can be of the blunt boring side. It's just rare and ppl don't get it.\n\nNoone of you are assholes", "NTA - what you eat is your business as long as you're preparing it and paying for it.\n\nIf your gf feels \"secretly judged\" she's insecure. And that's something that she needs to work on herself. Live and let live.", "It does sound like it COULD be veering into eating disorder territory if you can\u2019t adjust your macro/plan to be able to eat out once in awhile or cook a more elaborate meal together. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with having a boring, healthy diet, but if any change from literally the same foods every day is a cheat meal and can\u2019t be factored into a healthy day of eating, I am a little concerned for you and the sustainability of this diet.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s making this very much all about her and for that you are NTA.", "NTA : \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to eat what you want, healthy or not. I think it\u2019s respectful that you\u2019ll eat her meals once or twice a week, but as stated following her own diet every day would be a prohibition on your own goals. Also to consider, men and women have very different nutritional needs. No two people are going to have the exact same lifestyle, no two people have the exact same nutritional needs.", "Nta.\n\nHowever have you thought about whether this makes you compatible? I, like your girlfriend, am a foodie, I love cooking and trying new things and eating out, and I think I'd struggle to be with someone who didn't also like those things and ate a strict diet like you do. Food might be a love language for her, and not being able to share that can be hard. Just a thought!", "We are only hearing your side of the story so it\u2019s hard to tag you AH or not based solely on this information. Even then I don\u2019t think you are an AH tbh. \n\nHaving said that, if your dietary restriction is affecting her social life, i.e. she can\u2019t have a nice night out/go out for dinner, because you have to be home in time for your meal and/or cannot give her company..I can see why she\u2019ll be frustrated. \n\nMy advice - take her out to her favorite places on your cheat days!", "NTA it\u2019s your body so you can eat what you want. However, I will say that in my opinion part of being in a healthy relationship is appreciating and participating in each others hobbies. If cooking is something she enjoys doing it\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019d enjoy sharing the experience of eating what she made with her partner. I\u2019d say as long as you participate occasionally with tasting what she makes you\u2019re in the clear. And you did mention you wouldn\u2019t mind doing so once or twice a week, which I think is reasonable.", "NTA\n\nAsk her how she would feel if you started to try to dictate how she eats.  I bet she wouldn't like it at all.\n\nYou are just eating what you want to.  Even though she is eating healthily herself she shouldn't be trying to drag you down to her level and make you feel bad so she can feel better.", "NTA Eating the same exact things day in and day out will seem odd to many people, however it\u2019s your choice. If it makes your life easier, and keeps you on track there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. So long as your meeting all your nutritional requirements. That\u2019s the reason most people switch it up. Make sure you\u2019re taking a multivitamin to be safe. \n\nAs for your gf, just explain that you\u2019re not judging her by any means. Try to get to the reason she feels this way. Is your strict diet restricting your dating? Has it severely limited where you go out to? Is it affecting her in other ways? These could be the issues she\u2019s looking at that make her feel this way. Ask her about these and see if any compromises can be made. Cheat days possibly? When you eat her meals. Portion control will be your friend there to help you stay on track still.", "NTA, you are willing to compromise, but she isn't. You should ask her to alternate, so sometimes you follow her diet and sometimes she follows yours and see what she responds.", "NTA. You eat what you like and she can get over it.", "You are not the asshole.  She is overly sensitive to something she shouldn't be.  \n\nAs an aside, my youngest did the same thing as you... he ate only chicken breast (no spices) and rice for his base meals.  I'm sure there was other stuff he added... I remember oatmeal being part of it as well as frozen fruits.  He could cook... was a cook working for restaurants.  He just chose not to eat that way.\n\nThis was not a reflection on me or my eating habits.  It wasn't about me at all.  It was about him and what he felt was going to get him to his goals.", "NTA- in my opinion as someone who was with a woman who hated how much I worked out and dieted and everything that comes with the \"healthy\" lifestyle for me to stop it all to be with her more to eventually be dumped bc \"my body changed\" it sounds like she is the one self conscious of not eating as healthy as you. Although it is weird how you eat the some 4 things daily bc I was able to find all kinds of shit to eat when I counted Macros and worried about all that stuff so intently. Have a sit down conversation.  Explain your goals and how hard you are/have worked on it and how much it means to you. Figure out things that work for both of your diets and try to turn it into a special meal. Have a long conversation while eating it. Talk about your relationship. Use this whole ordeal as a way to bond more so than a way to despise one another. Hope it all works out for you guys in the end.", "I would call you the AH if you were eating unhealthy and being unreasonable if she expressed concerns, or if you were eating all your money away, but you're not doing either of those. Eating a bland diet doesn't concern her. You made a compromise (one or two times a week if she wants to share a meal) and she doesn't like that. If you aren't financially obligated to share meals, she's making a problem where there's not one. Just keep doing you if it works for you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

There is no rule to say you need to.", "NTA my boyfriend has a similar diet with shredded wheat for bfast, plain shredded chicken, and protein chips or a plain salad daily. \n\nI am not a health nut and eat whatever and his diet encouraged me to adjust my diet slightly. \n\nI want to be healthier because of him. Its a personal thing with your girl. DONT CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. She needs to respect you. If she's that embarrassed by her diet she can change it or just get over it.", "NTA your GF is being needlessly insecure and is making you feel terrible for eating healthy.", "NtA, you\u2019re not asking her to follow your diet and she\u2019s not asking you to follow hers. I don\u2019t think either of you are the asshole tbh. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re both happy with yourselves and not trying to push the other towards being something else, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you are at all, then all good!\n\nPerhaps this is just a social thing?  Did she come from a family that gets together to cook and eat socially?  If so then I can see why she would want you to do this occasionally, as eating separate food loses that shared experience. Yeah it could work if she ate your food on those occasions but, and I genuinely don\u2019t mean this offensively, super health food isn\u2019t always exciting to prepare and eat. \n\nDefinitely talk about it together, openly and honestly. Communication is the heart of any relationship and you might both come to appreciate where each other is coming from. \n\nI\u2019m sure you can forgo your health regime for one or two meals a month without too much impact?  That might be enough to achieve whatever she\u2019s looking for. \n\nMy own boyfriend went through a long period of eating that huel stuff and constantly tried to get me to eat it too, so I\u2019m really glad to read your both not doing that kind of thing. \n\nHope you guys work it out, don\u2019t let this become a wedge between you. There\u2019s always a compromise that works.", "I don't see at all how your diet impacts her? Is she that insecure? It's definitely her problem, fuck that shit. You can eat whatever you want.", "NTA\n\nMy hubby was the same in the beginning. He had problems losing weight and would sometimes become mad when i did sports or ate healthy and low calory bc it made him feel like a failure. \n\nThen he would make passiv aggressiv comments like \"do you have to make me feel bad with excersising now?\" And i told him i'm not excersising to make you feel bad but for me to feel good. What you are demanding is that i feel bad so you can feel good. \n\nThis got him thinking and reflecting and he realised taking out his insecurities on me will do nothing else than make us both miserable so he took accountability for his own issues and asked if i can cook my meals for him too and started to cook better for himself the days i only eat leftovers and he isn't in the mood. He still feels pressured sometimes if i do sports, but he knows its his issue to deal with.", "NTA. It's YOUR diet. What you put in YOUR body. She can't have boundaries about what you do to yourself. That's ridiculous. Keep doing what works for you and good luck on all your fitness goals!   \nMy husband and I both watch what we eat, but we both eat different things that make us feel healthy. We don't police each other's diet.", "NTA\n\nShe is the asshole. Why should you eat more and/or less healthy just to make her comfortable? \n\nShe is selfish, like we all are but needs to understand that  you can't impose your diet to someone else.", "NTA, but I love trying new recipies and take pride in my cooking so this would be extremely frustrating for me. Can you guys not come up with some macro friendly meals to have together? I do all the meal planning for my house and there are tons of healthy recipes out there to pick from. Theres some pretty good copycat recipies too.", "NTA at all.  I\u2019m pretty robotic w my eating too. I get it. To make her happy, could you do a very small (like on a saucer) portion of what she cooks & eat a few bites w her? It may be more about the bonding than the actual food for her.  I did this in a rel\u2019n w a foodie, and it made her happy. For her, the joy was in sharing what she cooked & she was spectacular in the kitchen. She got to share, I got amazing taste profiles in her food, and with 3-4 bites on a super small plate I stayed w my diet 95%.", "NTA. I grew up with a severe eating disorder that left me so malnourished I had mild brain damage.\n\nI've dated plenty of macrofactor gymbros since then and I now cook most of the food in the household with my partner.  We each have certain dietary requirements with the exercise schedules we do, but I'm able to feed us both, I'm happy and healthy, and it doesn't present an issue.\n\nIf I can get to this point and she doesn't have anything like that holding her back it sounds like a pointless thing to pick an argument over.", "NTA... She made up problem in her head and asked you to solve it. Now she is upset coz you declined.. \n\nWhile it's a good idea to add variety to your diet, it's not something she should be deciding on. She needs to take care of her insecurities.", "I do love a story where an SO's insecurity over something STUPID is now a problem. \n\nNTA + but her reaction and how she reacts to her own insecurities - trying to change other people to make herself feel more comfortable is a big bright On The 8's hurricane warning of a red flag. \n\nIt's food *this time* - how many other insecurities of hers will cause you to change your things up? She needs to make an Excel spreadsheet, so you can do it all at once, and annotate it.", "NTA, but I did end a relationship with someone for the reason of not being able to share fun meals together. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at first but when a couple is busy during the week, sometimes just a meal together at the end of the day is all you have to look forward to. Maybe come up with some other healthy meals together to mix it up, or this sounds like the same ending.", "NTA \n\nHer insecurities are running wild. \n\nYou've made it clear you are not judging her and what you eat is what works for your body and fitness regime. \nShe will not accept this at face value and I understand it's frustrating having to reassure her over and over. \n\nAsk her to rationalize her point. Why does she think you are judging her? What does she think would happen if you were judging her? Why does she want you to break out of your routine? \n\nI'd suggest she seeks therapy to deal with her insecurities around food and your relationship.", "NTA\n\nimagine getting angry about healthy food.... even calling your partner an ah....", "NTA - Her diet hang-ups about your food choices are created in her head. She needs to manage this; not you. You're not contributing to her negative monologue.\n\nShe requires 'all or nothing' regarding meals and is pissed you do not want to comply.

Best to you!", "NTA\n\nIt's all in her head.", "NTA Sounds like she's trying to undermine your regimen. You can't let that happen.", "Nah NTA, if the roles were reversed youd be getting called controlling!", "NTA. But I would say that not sharing meals would be a personal deal breaker for me. To me it's one of the things you just do in a relationship, but then again I'm European, and we tend to put more emphasis on shared meals here, I think. \n\n(I'm Swedish, but I write European, since I have lived in some 15 countries here, and really don't see myself as that Swedish anymore.)", "NTA she's insecure about her own food intake and now wants you to change yours? That's just dumb.", "NTA i do agree with everyone else saying she's probably insecure but many of the comments here are TAH.

Do you let her cook for you? Do you eat out at restaurants? Is this about her thinking her diet is better and wanting you to follow her diet, or does she want to share her love of food with you, and you wont budge on your strict diet and eat a meal with her occasionally?", "NAH. As someone who has recovered from ED,  Orthorexia and workout addiction I couldn\u2019t be with a person like you, not because you are doing anything wrong but because it\u2019s triggering and I might relapse. I find it horrible how some here assume that the fact that she is confessing that your behavior makes her uncomfortable does mean that she is just immature and insecure. Especially with orthorexia it\u2018s so tough to maintain a healthy life that doesn\u2019t drift back into obsessive counting and restrictions, because \u201cyou\u2019re just being healthy, nothing wrong with that\u201d. You are not the AH but I suggest you try to learn more about her feelings around nutrition and restricting. Also, be careful yourself, you are nearing ED territory if you can\u2019t even eat outside or at an event, looks like you don\u2019t wanna make exceptions to the plan you are following.", "It sounds like she wants to enjoy the shared experience of cooking and eating a meal together with you.  If your regimen is so strict you cannot share a good meal once in a while with friends and loved ones, you may have an obsession or addicted behavior to your one way of eating.  NTA, but seek psychological advice.", "N A H for now but ESH for long term\n\nBecause following this pattern long term will be too tedious for both of you. When you start living and cooking together, how many meals are you both going to be making? \n\nWhat happens if you have kids, how will you guys balance the time and effort going into daily chores - that includes cooking and cleaning. \n\nSo think about how compatible  y'all are.", "NAH\n\n\n> The issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet.

Things like this aren't just yes or no.\n\n\nTalk to your partner and figure out a compromise that make her feel a bit more comfortable without making you sacrifice your the efficiency of your diet.\n\n\nYou describe her as a \"foodie\". Clearly variety in food is a big part of her life that she wants to share with you. When your partner wants to share something of themsleves with you, you need to find some small way that it can happen.\n\n\nFor the record, I am like you. I would LOVE to eat exactly the same three meals everyday. But that would drive my girlfriend insane, so I don't take it to quite that extreme. I cycle through 3 or 4 dinners that I particularly like, so that she gets her variety and I get my consistency.\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n\nto the people that are arguing with me. oP took this comment just fine", "INFO: you say that she asked you to eat her cooking/follow her diet. \n\nI\u2019m going to guess that she asked for you to eat her cooking, and you interpreted it as her asking you to follow her diet. \n\nAm I right?", "Honestly sounds like both of you have food-related / vanity issues. You\u2019re saying she\u2019s fit and healthy, but also on principle refusing to eat what she eats because you\u2019d gain weight (??science unclear?) She\u2019s feeling shamed by this, and wants to share a love of food, but is then overstepping by trying to force you to eat how she eats. just try to enjoy the food once in a while, it won\u2019t kill you and you can still have your hard boiled eggs for breakfast", "NTA. You shouldn't have to eat what you don't want to eat, just like she shouldn't have to eat what she doesn't want to eat. But long term, there are ultimately compatibility issues. Sounds like a grocery shopping disaster logistically and I do think sharing meals together is a way for couples/families to connect at the end of a day. A compromise that would work long term is you're both on your own breakfast and lunch but share dinner together whether that is your food or here (ideally a combo or both).", "This issue is far more complex than we can even imagine...food is not just fuel for the body, we have evolved elaborate eating rituals, and it processed food with the OP and I both avoid (notice there is no meat in their diet) that is so profitable to agribusiness. \n\nEat what is right for you, let your GF spend her time and money on elaborate meals.  Beware of takeout pizza, it is my downfall.", "NTA but there is a social aspect to eating. Maybe even spiritual. Cooking for someone or sharing a new cuisine bonds people.\n\nSo maybe compromise and do some calorie counting on meals served at a restaurant she wants to try or a meal she makes so you can eat it every once in a while.", "NTA She lives to eat, you eat to live. If you eat with her a couple of times a week that's plenty.", "NTA. This is typical behaviour when people are confronted with behaviour they see as superior to their own.

Doing this however means I don't get a varied diet making it difficult for me to get all the right nutrients therefore the people around me have to either make me food or push for me to eat different food. Your girlfriend probably knows this if she's into healthy stuff and is uncomfortable with it because it's not good for you, plus your girlfriend is literally offering to make you tasty food that will make you healthy, I'm not really sure why you're denying tasty food. Anyways, even if you don't eat your gfs I'd reccomend getting some variation in that diet for your own sake. Good luck on the healthy eatin! Also try getting some chicken and fish in there, good for protein and vitamins, if I could eat chicken every day I would.", "Sound like you both need psychologists and nutritions for your eating disorders. \n\nNo judgement because youre both ill but you both need professional help.", "NAH\n\nBut I have to wonder.... \"she says my daily intake makes her feel i'm secretly judging her for eating less healthy than i am\".\n\nYour answer - IF she's able to eat what she likes and still manages to feel and look great....\n\nSo, you would judge her if she continued to eat the way she eats but starts putting on weight and it affected her looks? I mean it's a very small detail but she probably feels pre-judged and that your love is conditional. Your diet is already incompatible, which means bonding over food is not possible. She can't show you any family recipes, and she probably can't trust you to make any comfort food for her the way she likes them to be made. Be honest, if she asked you to make, I don't know, a stew or a pie the way her Grandmother made it, would you get the ingredients she asked or would you be thinking \"well instead of 20% beef mince, I'll get lean low salt mince. Instead of rich pastry, I'll get the reduced salt and sugar pastry\". Would you eat any of it? The food's already made, after all. \n\nI had a friend with an eating disorder and, and i'm not saying you have one but bare with me - For a few years before she finally admitted it, she coasted along in this \"I'm just living healthy!\" limbo, which yes, was healthy, in some ways.

I find tracking calories to be tedious, and never was a big foodie so as a result I\u2019ve lapsed into eating the same foods almost daily, and that works for me even if it\u2019s \u2018boring\u2019. My diet on a usual day consists of oatmeal with fruit/nuts, eggs, protein shakes, and vegetables. \n\nMy girlfriend says she feels uncomfortable by how healthy I eat. She\u2019s very healthy herself, but a foodie, and tends to cook/eat a lot more elaborate meals than I do. She says my daily intake makes her feel I\u2019m secretly judging her for eating less healthy than I am.\n\nI\u2019m not, because what works works. If she\u2019s able to eat what she likes and still manage to feel and look great, then by all means. Same goes for me: if I\u2019m able to meet my goals, and not get tired of what may seem a boring diet, then also I think that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet. I don\u2019t mind doing so once or twice a week, but doing so every day would be detrimental to my goals, so I declined. \n\nThis made her angry, and she said I was an AH for being inconsiderate.

It'd be good for your health and for your relationship!\n\nI can even share some books I have to help you out if you want.", "One thing I\u2019ll say is if you aren\u2019t varying your diet enough, you\u2019ll miss out on some nutrients.

Don't miss it. \n\n\nIf you live together and contribute zero to shared meals and who knows what else, YTA. Also she shouldn't mind because of your abs? LOL brother, oh boy.

A foodie/someone who enjoys food and sees it as a relevant part of a happy life won't have a great relationship with someone who sees food as merely fuel for the body. I think it's 2 things here:\n\n1.: you eating things just because you consider them super healthy somewhat implies that other foods are less healthy, which is not exactly true, but the subconscious hint is there.\n\n2.: not being able to enjoy good food also implies that someone who does enjoy food is unhealthier in general. People tend to value 'rational' reasons higher than 'irrational', so rationalizing instead of enjoying always subconsciously implies judgement towards the one enjoying their lives, even if unjustified.\n\nI think that's what makes your gf uncomfortable. You say that what she cooks is healthy, so she has no reason to actually blame herself for something.\n\nFood is not mere fuel. Optimizing something that brings joy and comfort to someone else is extremely toxic. Anything that anyone does for fun should not be optimized, unless it's actually unhealthy. If she ate actual bullshit, telling her that would be something else.\n\nNow it's your perfect right to eat as optimized as you like  (you know that eating the same things every day is not healthy, right?), but I don't think your gf will ever be happy with this.

Can make some compromises and have her cook the food maybe using less oil/butter, more protein etc. Then you can eat with her, meet your goals and can potentially be a fun bit of problem-solving for her to find ways to make delicious meals nutritious as well.

I meal prep for both of us but it is according to very specific macros and a strict FODMAP diet (which I have to do for IBS).

Turns out the whole time my focus on macros for the meals made her feel like I thought she needed to loose weight. We calmly talked about the root cause of the issue and worked it out. I just give her larger portions now than I give myself :)\n\n@OP this issue has nothing to do with the food. There is something deeper your girlfriend is upset about and you both need to have an adult conversation and figure out the root cause.

We have young kids (too young for solid food currently), but it\u2019s important to me that we eat as a family; and my kids see us eating a variety of foods and cuisines. Not having a family dinner most nights is an absolute deal breaker for me. The benefits of proper family dinner are just to numerous to forego it. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be happy in a relationship with someone who eats like the OP and I wouldn\u2019t want such a restrictive diet modelled for our kids.", "Not sure why you\u2019re getting downvoted for telling your truth here\u2014 some corners of the internet tend to be crawling with chronically insecure armchair psychologists who *love* throwing around medical terms or *diagnosing random strangers whom they\u2019ve never met.* \n\nMany of these people cling onto intense feelings of bitterness towards anyone who claims to be \u201chealthy\u201d without somehow having an ED or ED related food issues. \n\nThese people *love* to insist that you *must* be disordered or unwell because they get to feel better about themselves that way. The craaaaazy idea that you can have a healthy diet and routine *without* being horribly disordered well\u2014 that makes it harder for them to maintain a sense of superiority. Misery loves misery. Miserable people *hate* to see success or happiness in others and will stop at nothing to insist that \u201cnonono you must be secretly miserable and sick and\u2014\u201c\n\nYou do you man. You know yourself and your own diet the best. This is a personal issue. No one has the right to demand or force you change what you put into your body. If the roles were reversed and you were the one trying to *force* your GF follow *your* diet\u2014 everyone would be freaking out calling you TA (and rightfully so). There\u2019s no reason why she should be exempt from the basic moral fact that *no one has a right to dictate how or what somebody else choose to eat.*", "As a therapist who treats clients with disordered eating and EDs, the first time I read your post, I thought the same thing, but I think it's the way you worded it. Only eating oatmeal, nuts, fruits, vegetables, eggs, and protein shakes is a VERY restrictive diet; these also don't sound like meals, they sound like snacks. It looks like you have cut out three food groups (most carbohydrates, fats, dairy), and are only willing to change that once or twice a week. If you add in the context of, \" willing to eat outside my diet with moderate frequency,\" it sounds more varied, and less rigid. \n\nI do wonder, are you eating *with* your girlfriend? If most of your protein is coming from shakes and eggs, are you drinking your meals? It might be worth looking into that behavior, and if it's your diet, or the context of it.", "Agreed, macro tracking and obsessively working out seem to be the most common ways disordered food behaviours show up in men - I\u2019m just saying that if the foods he eats are based on macros and not on just if they\u2019re generally balanced or whatever, that would explain why subbing in his gf\u2019s meals wouldn\u2019t \u2018meet his goals\u2019 or however he put it, regardless of if she makes healthy meals.

He says he decided on a diet to avoid having to count calories, etc,  but we don't know if that diet is really appropriate for what his goals are.\n\nThe nutrition needs for a bodybuilder are different than a powerlifter and different from a runner or swimmer or triathlete. My suggestion is OP and GF consider meeting with a nutritionist of some type so they can clearly set out their goals and figure out a middle path. I would not be surprised if a nutritionist has several suggestions on improvements and options for variety.\n\nMaybe OP continues with the same breakfast and lunch, and they come up with guidelines for what should be in the dinner. Maybe OP finds out a couple of changes would help him meet his goals better, or just help him feel better.", "Honestly it doesn't take that much work though? It's kind of like finance and budgeting your macros/calories. If I know I'm going out with the boys on Friday night for dinner and I'm going to wind up having a 1500 calorie meal, I just eat less during the day or go twice as hard on my workout or do some extra cardio to free up some calorie space. It's not hard to manage a couple days of \"fun\" eating a week. I have fitness friends that completely freak out and can't even enjoy going on vacation because they get so bogged down in macros and numbers when it's really not that difficult to manage it.", "He sounds like he's into bodybuilding, believe me the most important thing for one is a well rounded diet. I'm the exact same as OP except my girlfriend eats more or less what I cook (she takes what I make and spins it her own way so as to not get bored), and my meals are literally the same thing every single day so as to hit my protein, carb, fat macros while staying within range for micros. It's just easier that way so you don't have to think about what you're eating, you just scarf it down", "Yeah I have a diet that\u2019s very limited in variety because of ARFID and over the years I\u2019ve run into a lot of issues with accidentally getting various vitamin deficiencies, especially because I can\u2019t eat meat due to texture issues. His diet is healthier than mine because at least there\u2019s eggs in there and probably more vegetables than I\u2019m getting but it\u2019s still crazy easy to end up not getting all the nutrients you need if you\u2019re eating repetitively", "Exactly, my boyfriend doesn't eat pork and hes pretty picky on vegetables, I can totally jive with a restrictive diet but OP is so restrictive you can't ever share a meal together.", "Yeah thats kinda how most amblical relationships should end... with 2 people realizing they don't fit together.", "I used to not believe people when they said that if you try to improve yourself that people around you are going to dislike that, but I'm starting to see it a little bit more. That being said I have noticed a lot more positivity around me as well. For the first time in my life the other day when I said something about trying to lose some weight I wasn't met with a \"That's great\" it was a \"Really? You're looking good though.\" That was nice. I do still have a little way to go.

OP has his preferences and that\u2019s fine. Complete dietary inflexibility is not sustainable and not normal.", "Let\u2019s stop assuming that someone that tracks their food intake daily has a 99% chance of having an obsession with healthy foods. I have done this, I am still doing it and I can\u2019t see how that makes me anxious at all. It\u2019s just food. It\u2019s just a little bit more effort. It\u2019s not this crazy insane thing people make it out to be. \n\nI swear most people that think this is very likely an unhealthy obsession are just mad cause they don\u2019t have the motivation. You don\u2019t wanna do it? Cool. But saying that doing so it\u2019s an unhealthy obsession is dramatic as hell.\n\nSure there are people that struggle with this but that is the extreme. Most people that do this are not in that extreme. Being careful about your diet does not equal mental illness.", "That is also very much a \u201eher problem\u201c not his. And her trying to guilt trip him into compliance with claiming he is inconsiderate to not switch because it makes her feel, only for this reason, like he judges her on her diet is so far out there I wouldn\u2019t even know what to say in OPs situation apart from maybe: no, but are you alright?  And if yes: get a grip. \n\nNTA", "I fully agree, but I'm a lot like OP's girlfriend and this situation would probably be a deal breaker for me. I know not everyone thinks the same way, but I feel cooking together or at least eating the same meals together and sharing the experience is extremely important in a relationship. Just sitting at the same table and eating different things wouldn't feel the same to me, and then you have to figure out the logistics of each person getting their individual dinner done at the same time so you have the chance to eat together. \n\nOne of the perks of being in a relationship is also about sharing the household duties including cooking instead of having to do it all yourself. The duties would still technically be split equally in this situation since each person would cook and clean up after themselves. Nonetheless, I'd find it hard to be in a relationship knowing I had to do 100% of the cooking for myself or that my partner would maybe only eat the delicious things I made once or twice a week. \n\nOn top of all of that, there's the issue that OP's strict diet sometimes makes his girlfriend feel bad about herself for what she makes. None of this is to say that OP is an asshole, but it doesn't really seem like he and his girlfriend are all that compatible.", "Yes and if she would have voiced to OP it\u2019s about sharing the dinners and so on, the verdict might be different, but she didn\u2019t.
