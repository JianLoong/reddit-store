I find tracking calories to be tedious, and never was a big foodie so as a result I\u2019ve lapsed into eating the same foods almost daily, and that works for me even if it\u2019s \u2018boring\u2019. My diet on a usual day consists of oatmeal with fruit/nuts, eggs, protein shakes, and vegetables. \n\nMy girlfriend says she feels uncomfortable by how healthy I eat. She\u2019s very healthy herself, but a foodie, and tends to cook/eat a lot more elaborate meals than I do. She says my daily intake makes her feel I\u2019m secretly judging her for eating less healthy than I am.\n\nI\u2019m not, because what works works. If she\u2019s able to eat what she likes and still manage to feel and look great, then by all means. Same goes for me: if I\u2019m able to meet my goals, and not get tired of what may seem a boring diet, then also I think that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet. I don\u2019t mind doing so once or twice a week, but doing so every day would be detrimental to my goals, so I declined. \n\nThis made her angry, and she said I was an AH for being inconsiderate.

However, some food for thought (sorry, couldn\u2019t resist):\n\n- Do you frequently talk about your diet or make comments about how or why you eat the way you do? (Comments like \u201coh I can\u2019t possibly eat *that* because then *this* will happen to me\u201d, or anything similar)\n\n- Do you eat your separate meals together or do you eat alone at different times?\n\n- Do you talk about food in a way that makes it seem like you think it\u2019s silly that other people place importance on it?\n\n- Is the food she is making special to her in a cultural way?\n\n- Do you comment on her food, exercise routine, body type, or anything related to her physical form or dietary habits?\n\n- Does she come from a background of food insecurity, or otherwise have past trauma with things related to diet or exercise?\n\n- Do you take her out to dinners or have elaborate meals because it\u2019s important to her, even if it isn\u2019t to you?\n\n- Since you live together, how is food paid for? Is it possible that she feels guilty for spending more on food you aren\u2019t eating out of a shared budget?\n\nI think you need to sit down and really hash this out together. Even if this is just 100% her own insecurities things likely cannot continue in this pattern long term. Neither of you should have to change your diet but you do need to come to some sort of understanding.", "NtA, tell her stop being insecure and ridiculous. food is fuel and diet is extremely personal, tell her you won't compromise the comfortability of what you put in your body simply because she feels unwarranted shame. your health is your own, she won't feel the effects of your altered diet, you will", "NTA.\n\n>asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet\n\nImagine the reaction if you said this to her.", "NTA. You get to decide what you eat. It's your choice whether to be flexible on that.\n\nIf you can't be flexible, though, be prepared for the possibility that it might end up being a deal-breaker for her. If sharing her love of food is important to her in a relationship, or if your diet triggers body image issues for her, it might just be one of those situations where you're incompatible.", "So you're being an AH for being inconsiderate, but she is in the right for being inconsiderate?\n\nI don't understand people...\n\nNTA imo...", "NTA I seriously don\u2019t get the YT.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re forcing her to do anything g so why does she think she has the right to tell you how you eat? \n\nI feel like a talk is needed for this to work out. As you said, you do you and she can do whatever she wants!

It seems like this is an insecurity of hers. I know a few people who had comments made about their eating habits in the past and are now insecure and hyper aware of the possibility of people judging them in regards to eating. Go easy on her. There\u2019s clearly a reason she\u2019s bothered by this and there\u2019s a fair few comments here that seem to be lacking the other side\u2019s perspective and talking shit about her. Empathy and understanding is the way forward and helping her get to the root of the issue will hopefully help begin to dispel the insecurity.", "I don't think she wants you to break your diet. She thinks you are entering Ed territory.\n\nMost ppl eating for survival but also for pleasure.\n\nThose like you that don't care much about food pleasure usually just eat so they won't die and foods can be of the blunt boring side.

There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with having a boring, healthy diet, but if any change from literally the same foods every day is a cheat meal and can\u2019t be factored into a healthy day of eating, I am a little concerned for you and the sustainability of this diet.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s making this very much all about her and for that you are NTA.", "NTA : \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to eat what you want, healthy or not. I think it\u2019s respectful that you\u2019ll eat her meals once or twice a week, but as stated following her own diet every day would be a prohibition on your own goals. Also to consider, men and women have very different nutritional needs. No two people are going to have the exact same lifestyle, no two people have the exact same nutritional needs.", "Nta.\n\nHowever have you thought about whether this makes you compatible? I, like your girlfriend, am a foodie, I love cooking and trying new things and eating out, and I think I'd struggle to be with someone who didn't also like those things and ate a strict diet like you do. Food might be a love language for her, and not being able to share that can be hard. Just a thought!", "We are only hearing your side of the story so it\u2019s hard to tag you AH or not based solely on this information. Even then I don\u2019t think you are an AH tbh. \n\nHaving said that, if your dietary restriction is affecting her social life, i.e. she can\u2019t have a nice night out/go out for dinner, because you have to be home in time for your meal and/or cannot give her company..I can see why she\u2019ll be frustrated. \n\nMy advice - take her out to her favorite places on your cheat days!", "NTA it\u2019s your body so you can eat what you want. However, I will say that in my opinion part of being in a healthy relationship is appreciating and participating in each others hobbies. If cooking is something she enjoys doing it\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019d enjoy sharing the experience of eating what she made with her partner. I\u2019d say as long as you participate occasionally with tasting what she makes you\u2019re in the clear. And you did mention you wouldn\u2019t mind doing so once or twice a week, which I think is reasonable.", "NTA\n\nAsk her how she would feel if you started to try to dictate how she eats.  I bet she wouldn't like it at all.\n\nYou are just eating what you want to.

If it makes your life easier, and keeps you on track there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. So long as your meeting all your nutritional requirements. That\u2019s the reason most people switch it up. Make sure you\u2019re taking a multivitamin to be safe. \n\nAs for your gf, just explain that you\u2019re not judging her by any means. Try to get to the reason she feels this way. Is your strict diet restricting your dating? Has it severely limited where you go out to? Is it affecting her in other ways? These could be the issues she\u2019s looking at that make her feel this way. Ask her about these and see if any compromises can be made. Cheat days possibly? When you eat her meals. Portion control will be your friend there to help you stay on track still.", "NTA, you are willing to compromise, but she isn't. You should ask her to alternate, so sometimes you follow her diet and sometimes she follows yours and see what she responds.", "NTA. You eat what you like and she can get over it.", "You are not the asshole.  She is overly sensitive to something she shouldn't be.  \n\nAs an aside, my youngest did the same thing as you... he ate only chicken breast (no spices) and rice for his base meals.  I'm sure there was other stuff he added... I remember oatmeal being part of it as well as frozen fruits.  He could cook... was a cook working for restaurants.  He just chose not to eat that way.\n\nThis was not a reflection on me or my eating habits.  It wasn't about me at all.  It was about him and what he felt was going to get him to his goals.", "NTA- in my opinion as someone who was with a woman who hated how much I worked out and dieted and everything that comes with the \"healthy\" lifestyle for me to stop it all to be with her more to eventually be dumped bc \"my body changed\" it sounds like she is the one self conscious of not eating as healthy as you. Although it is weird how you eat the some 4 things daily bc I was able to find all kinds of shit to eat when I counted Macros and worried about all that stuff so intently. Have a sit down conversation.  Explain your goals and how hard you are/have worked on it and how much it means to you. Figure out things that work for both of your diets and try to turn it into a special meal. Have a long conversation while eating it. Talk about your relationship. Use this whole ordeal as a way to bond more so than a way to despise one another. Hope it all works out for you guys in the end.", "I would call you the AH if you were eating unhealthy and being unreasonable if she expressed concerns, or if you were eating all your money away, but you're not doing either of those. Eating a bland diet doesn't concern her. You made a compromise (one or two times a week if she wants to share a meal) and she doesn't like that. If you aren't financially obligated to share meals, she's making a problem where there's not one. Just keep doing you if it works for you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

Its a personal thing with your girl. DONT CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. She needs to respect you. If she's that embarrassed by her diet she can change it or just get over it.", "NTA your GF is being needlessly insecure and is making you feel terrible for eating healthy.", "NtA, you\u2019re not asking her to follow your diet and she\u2019s not asking you to follow hers.

Did she come from a family that gets together to cook and eat socially?  If so then I can see why she would want you to do this occasionally, as eating separate food loses that shared experience. Yeah it could work if she ate your food on those occasions but, and I genuinely don\u2019t mean this offensively, super health food isn\u2019t always exciting to prepare and eat. \n\nDefinitely talk about it together, openly and honestly. Communication is the heart of any relationship and you might both come to appreciate where each other is coming from. \n\nI\u2019m sure you can forgo your health regime for one or two meals a month without too much impact?  That might be enough to achieve whatever she\u2019s looking for. \n\nMy own boyfriend went through a long period of eating that huel stuff and constantly tried to get me to eat it too, so I\u2019m really glad to read your both not doing that kind of thing. \n\nHope you guys work it out, don\u2019t let this become a wedge between you. There\u2019s always a compromise that works.", "I don't see at all how your diet impacts her? Is she that insecure? It's definitely her problem, fuck that shit. You can eat whatever you want.", "NTA\n\nMy hubby was the same in the beginning. He had problems losing weight and would sometimes become mad when i did sports or ate healthy and low calory bc it made him feel like a failure. \n\nThen he would make passiv aggressiv comments like \"do you have to make me feel bad with excersising now?\" And i told him i'm not excersising to make you feel bad but for me to feel good. What you are demanding is that i feel bad so you can feel good. \n\nThis got him thinking and reflecting and he realised taking out his insecurities on me will do nothing else than make us both miserable so he took accountability for his own issues and asked if i can cook my meals for him too and started to cook better for himself the days i only eat leftovers and he isn't in the mood. He still feels pressured sometimes if i do sports, but he knows its his issue to deal with.", "NTA. It's YOUR diet. What you put in YOUR body. She can't have boundaries about what you do to yourself. That's ridiculous. Keep doing what works for you and good luck on all your fitness goals!   \nMy husband and I both watch what we eat, but we both eat different things that make us feel healthy. We don't police each other's diet.", "NTA\n\nShe is the asshole. Why should you eat more and/or less healthy just to make her comfortable? \n\nShe is selfish, like we all are but needs to understand that  you can't impose your diet to someone else.", "NTA, but I love trying new recipies and take pride in my cooking so this would be extremely frustrating for me. Can you guys not come up with some macro friendly meals to have together? I do all the meal planning for my house and there are tons of healthy recipes out there to pick from. Theres some pretty good copycat recipies too.", "NTA at all.  I\u2019m pretty robotic w my eating too. I get it. To make her happy, could you do a very small (like on a saucer) portion of what she cooks & eat a few bites w her? It may be more about the bonding than the actual food for her.  I did this in a rel\u2019n w a foodie, and it made her happy. For her, the joy was in sharing what she cooked & she was spectacular in the kitchen. She got to share, I got amazing taste profiles in her food, and with 3-4 bites on a super small plate I stayed w my diet 95%.", "NTA. I grew up with a severe eating disorder that left me so malnourished I had mild brain damage.\n\nI've dated plenty of macrofactor gymbros since then and I now cook most of the food in the household with my partner.  We each have certain dietary requirements with the exercise schedules we do, but I'm able to feed us both, I'm happy and healthy, and it doesn't present an issue.\n\nIf I can get to this point and she doesn't have anything like that holding her back it sounds like a pointless thing to pick an argument over.", "NTA... She made up problem in her head and asked you to solve it. Now she is upset coz you declined.. \n\nWhile it's a good idea to add variety to your diet, it's not something she should be deciding on. She needs to take care of her insecurities.", "I do love a story where an SO's insecurity over something STUPID is now a problem. \n\nNTA + but her reaction and how she reacts to her own insecurities - trying to change other people to make herself feel more comfortable is a big bright On The 8's hurricane warning of a red flag. \n\nIt's food *this time* - how many other insecurities of hers will cause you to change your things up? She needs to make an Excel spreadsheet, so you can do it all at once, and annotate it.", "NTA, but I did end a relationship with someone for the reason of not being able to share fun meals together. I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal at first but when a couple is busy during the week, sometimes just a meal together at the end of the day is all you have to look forward to. Maybe come up with some other healthy meals together to mix it up, or this sounds like the same ending.", "NTA \n\nHer insecurities are running wild. \n\nYou've made it clear you are not judging her and what you eat is what works for your body and fitness regime. \nShe will not accept this at face value and I understand it's frustrating having to reassure her over and over. \n\nAsk her to rationalize her point. Why does she think you are judging her? What does she think would happen if you were judging her? Why does she want you to break out of your routine? \n\nI'd suggest she seeks therapy to deal with her insecurities around food and your relationship.", "NTA\n\nimagine getting angry about healthy food.... even calling your partner an ah....", "NTA - Her diet hang-ups about your food choices are created in your head. She needs to manage this; not you. You're not contributing to her negative monologue.  \n\nShe requires 'all of nothing' regarding meals and is pissed you do not want to comply.

You can't let that happen.", "Nah NTA, if the roles were reversed youd be getting called controlling!", "NTA. But I would say that not sharing meals would be a personal deal breaker for me.

As someone who has recovered from ED,  Orthorexia and workout addiction I couldn\u2019t be with a person like you, not because you are doing anything wrong but because it\u2019s triggering and I might relapse. I find it horrible how some here assume her confessing it makes her uncomfortable means she is just immature and insecure. Especially with orthorexia it\u2018s so tough to maintain a healthy life that doesn\u2019t drift back into obsessive counting and restrictions. You are not the AH but I suggest you try to learn more about her feelings around nutrition and restricting.", "It sounds like she wants to enjoy the shared experience of cooking and eating a meal together with you.  If your regimen is so strict you cannot share a good meal once in a while with friends and loved ones, you may have an obsession or addicted behavior to your one way of eating.  NTA, but seek psychological advice.", "N A H for now but ESH for long term\n\nBecause following this pattern long term will be too tedious for both of you. When you start living and cooking together, how many meals are you both going to be making? \n\nWhat happens if you have kids, how will you guys balance the time and effort going into daily chores - that includes cooking and cleaning. \n\nSo think about how compatible  y'all are.", "NAH\n\n\n> The issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet.

I would LOVE to eat exactly the same three meals everyday. But that would drive my girlfriend insane, so I don't take it to quite that extreme.

You\u2019re saying she\u2019s fit and healthy, but also on principle refusing to eat what she eats because you\u2019d gain weight (??science unclear?) She\u2019s feeling shamed by this, and wants to share a love of food, but is then overstepping by trying to force you to eat how she eats. just try to enjoy the food once in a while, it won\u2019t kill you and you can still have your hard boiled eggs for breakfast", "NTA. You shouldn't have to eat what you don't want to eat, just like she shouldn't have to eat what she doesn't want to eat. But long term, there are ultimately compatibility issues. Sounds like a grocery shopping disaster logistically and I do think sharing meals together is a way for couples/families to connect at the end of a day. A compromise that would work long term is you're both on your own breakfast and lunch but share dinner together whether that is your food or here (ideally a combo or both).", "This issue is far more complex than we can even imagine...food is not just fuel for the body, we have evolved elaborate eating rituals, and it processed food with the OP and I both avoid (notice there is no meat in their diet) that is so profitable to agribusiness. \n\nEat what is right for you, let your GF spend her time and money on elaborate meals.  Beware of takeout pizza, it is my downfall.", "NTA but there is a social aspect to eating. Maybe even spiritual.

Doing this however means I don't get a varied diet making it difficult for me to get all the right nutrients therefore the people around me have to either make me food or push for me to eat different food. Your girlfriend probably knows this if she's into healthy stuff and is uncomfortable with it because it's not good for you, plus your girlfriend is literally offering to make you tasty food that will make you healthy, I'm not really sure why you're denying tasty food. Anyways, even if you don't eat your gfs I'd reccomend getting some variation in that diet for your own sake. Good luck on the healthy eatin! Also try getting some chicken and fish in there, good for protein and vitamins, if I could eat chicken every day I would.", "Sound like you both need psychologists and nutritions for your eating disorders. \n\nNo judgement because youre both ill but you both need professional help.", "NAH\n\nBut I have to wonder.... \"she says my daily intake makes her feel i'm secretly judging her for eating less healthy than i am\".\n\nYour answer - IF she's able to eat what she likes and still manages to feel and look great....\n\nSo, you would judge her if she continued to eat the way she eats but starts putting on weight and it affected her looks? I mean it's a very small detail but she probably feels pre-judged and that your love is conditional. Your diet is already incompatible, which means bonding over food is not possible. She can't show you any family recipes, and she probably can't trust you to make any comfort food for her the way she likes them to be made. Be honest, if she asked you to make, I don't know, a stew or a pie the way her Grandmother made it, would you get the ingredients she asked or would you be thinking \"well instead of 20% beef mince, I'll get lean low salt mince. Instead of rich pastry, I'll get the reduced salt and sugar pastry\". Would you eat any of it? The food's already made, after all. \n\nI had a friend with an eating disorder and, and i'm not saying you have one but bare with me - For a few years before she finally admitted it, she coasted along in this \"I'm just living healthy!\" limbo, which yes, was healthy, in some ways. More vegetables and watching how much sugar you eat is healthy. But not emotionally. Not when you can't take part in something that means something to other people. Not when you say \"I'm not judging you for eating the food you like... but I could never eat it because it's disgustingly fattening\".  Which is more important, bonding with your girlfriend, or \"meeting your goals\"?\n\nthere's some middle grounds between being a foodie, and not caring for food but basic nutrition, but then you also wouldn't mind a burger delivered or something lazy and easy like instant noodles just to eat something that day if it was truly just about eating to survive.

She\u2019s very healthy herself, but a foodie, and tends to cook/eat a lot more elaborate meals than I do. She says my daily intake makes her feel I\u2019m secretly judging her for eating less healthy than I am.\n\nI\u2019m not, because what works works. If she\u2019s able to eat what she likes and still manage to feel and look great, then by all means. Same goes for me: if I\u2019m able to meet my goals, and not get tired of what may seem a boring diet, then also I think that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe issue is she disagrees, and asks me to start eating her cooking/follow her diet. I don\u2019t mind doing so once or twice a week, but doing so every day would be detrimental to my goals, so I declined. \n\nThis made her angry, and she said I was an AH for being inconsiderate.
