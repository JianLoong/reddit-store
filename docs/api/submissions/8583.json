I\u2019m quite sure she\u2019s not considered this.", "Well said", "Hahaha, that doesn't mean he isn't an asshole.", "Just because he had the right to say no doesn't mean he isn't an asshole. I see a couple people making this argument and it really doesn't make any sense. It's like saying that someone who says hateful shit isn't an asshole because it's his right to say hateful shit according to the law.", "Why is it obscene to compare yourself to a nurse or postal worker? I\u2019m so confused by your comment.", "You a teacher? The reason we\u2019re striking is partially because of the workload that we have outside of our contracted hours (even when remote working during the pandemic how many of us were still pulling 60-80 hour weeks), and to protest the awful conditions our students are made to endure as well as us in the name of \u201ccost cutting\u201d and \u201cefficiency\u201d. Lack of TAs, student support, accessible provision, resources and opportunities for disabled teachers, as well as the ludicrous class sizes, exam led teaching - all of this has built over years of default neoliberalism pioneered in the 80s and now we need to show that we\u2019ve had enough.", "Genuinely not being able to afford to strike sucks hard - maybe talk to your union and see if they have a strike fund?", "In Ontario Education workers who are the lowest-paid staff in public schools - educational assistants, child care staff, janitors - were negotiating with a regressive  conservative government and the government\u2019s offer was ridiculous given the high cost of living right now.  They voted to strike and before they even hit the picket lines the government tabled legislation outlawing their right to strike and imposing absurdly large fines on unions and individual members if they went out anyway. They used a weird loophole in the Canadian constitution called the Notwithstanding Clause to get around the fact that the right is protected in our constitution.  Well not only were the education workers prepared to go out anyway, they had the entire labour movement ready to start joining them. There was something like 40 heads of unions on the stage at a press conference to demonstrate their solidarity. It was something to behold.  Lo and behold, the government backed down, withdrew the legislation and went back to the bargaining table.  They picked what they thought would be the weakest union to pick off and make an example of - a union made up of mostly women, many working part time for peanut wages.  They picked wrong.", "I saw two things there: you don't cross a picket line AND you support the union, as in support the decisions of the union body (your coworkers).", "Talk about fight club?", "Language class. Should be 'don't let down the union' I guess.", "Our salaries are pretty shite and we are expected to do basically our entire hours over unpaid behind the scenes or at home. Most full time teachers I know (I\u2019m part time) work 60-80 hour weeks and get paid for 37.5", "Teachers have had below inflation pay rises for over a decade. The workload and stress is increasing every year. The private sector overall has had better pay rises than teachers for a while now. If you check the ONS, for the 3 months to November 22 private sector pay rise was 7.2% compared to 3.3% for public sector. This doesn't account for inflation which at the time was over 10%.\n\nTo sum up, teachers definitely need more money.", "you are so very wrong - the private sector is getting far higher pay rises and often through strike action \n\nteachers need more money and. more teachers \n\nJesus", "Yes it was a bad comparison on my part. During the pamdemic, the group I'm referring to largely worked from home; very few had to come onsite. So when they compare their work to individuals who did, essential workers like postmen and nurses, I find it off-putting. I shouldn't have included it because it's very specific to 'my' union and is why I support people who chose not to strike.", "I'm not part of the union, because I can't afford the monthly membership fee.", "They\u2019re joking because the comment says there\u2019s two things you DONT do but they list one you don\u2019t and one you do", "I know all about the work load. My wife is a teacher. Teaching salaries are relatively good. The starting salary is around the average UK salary and those who are experienced can earn around \u00a340k. \n\nTeachers hourly rate of pay however is fucking rubbish, for the reasons you and I have mentioned. If you reduce the workload, you increase the rate of pay and improve the work life balance. This is where I feel teachers unions should be focussing. This is more likely to gain public support. \n\nThe other thing to consider is that the money has got to come from somewhere. Given the current financial climate and the state of or country\u2019s finances, where exactly so you think it\u2019s going to come from?", "Teachers starting salary is around average for the UK. With experience, teachers can earn around \u00a340k per year. Teachers don\u2019t need a pay rise. Teachers DO need a significant reduction in work load and an improvement in work life balance. \n\nI\u2019d assume that the majority people this year have had below inflation pay rises. Given the state of this country\u2019s finances, where exactly do you think this extra 10-12% is going to come from?", "If you are in the union it is your duty to fellow workers to give your solidarity. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have an in person or remote role. \nIf the union votes to strike, you strike!\n\nIt\u2019s more off putting for me to see workers take the benefits of the union without contributing.", "That\u2019s so intensely sad, I\u2019m so sorry. As someone who isn\u2019t in the union I don\u2019t think you have any recourse to industrial action anyway so you don\u2019t need to worry \u2764\ufe0f", "But that is why we\u2019re striking. It\u2019s not just about pay rise (which would go part way to compensate what we are expected to pull in an hourly sense) but it\u2019s more generally about conditions not only for us but for our students. Linking strikes only to pay is reductive but it is something perpetuated by unions as well because it\u2019s an easier and more swallowable goal than \u201cwe frankly need an overhaul in the entire system of education and society more broadly\u201d.\n\nETA: Also because I\u2019m disabled and therefore can\u2019t take any \u201creal\u201d teaching opportunities (no one wants a part time teacher you have to make accommodations for and even then they\u2019d try to push you too far on a cultural \u201cwe all do it why can\u2019t you, don\u2019t you care enough?\u201d basis) I\u2019m supply. My current pay teaching is about \u00a3100 a day, to include all holiday pay at the very top end of the scale. It\u2019s pretty crap. I\u2019m usually more likely to earn \u00a380 a day for teaching.", "pay in the UK has been held back for over a decade, so whether a salary is average for the UK is meaningless - compare it to the cost of living\n\nThere is plenty of money in the UK - just look to see how much was flushed down the toilet with bad contracts during Covid. We are one of the richest countries in the world", "That's why I'm torn - on the one hand, OP voted no and they don't want to strike, which I understand. But, unlike me, they did join the union, which makes me think actually they should be on strike.\n\nAlso the remote thing - as I said, terrible comparison, but this was specifically during the pandemic. It's something OP would understand if they're in the same sector as me. Ignore it, I shouldn't have included it.", "Why are you at a union job but not in the union? Are you in a right to work state?", "I'm im higher education in the UK; most people are actually not in a union (although this varies by institution and often also by the specific area within an institution).\n\nThere are 3 'main' unions HE workers can join, depending on what job you're in, and then we also have a small number of staff in the NHS unions or teachers union as they are on slightly different contracts.", "Yes, but why didn\u2019t you join your workplace union?", "I was a member years ago but I left:\n\n1. The union I'm eligible to join is for academic and professional services staff at a certain salary and above, but the number of times I was advised to join a different union (that I wasn't eligible for) because I wasn't a lecturer was just ridiculous. \n\n2. At my institution, academic members of the union frequently made disparaging comments about professional services staff, saying there are too many of us and that when there are cuts, we should be the ones targerted. Solidarity my foot.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think this is local to my institution because I see a lot of this shit from union members on twitter (it's a national union).\n\nIn short, they simply do not represent me."]}
