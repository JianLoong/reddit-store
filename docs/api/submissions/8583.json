You joined the union on free will and it wouldn't be a union if people will only do their part when they are need something directly.\n\nAnd honestly, your work ethic is good and fine, but if you do good work you should demand a fair paycheck.

But when it's for only 1 day it's much harder to fill with contract or scab labor. It's much harder to find people willing to do it for only 1 day vs a week and if your employer uses a contracting company to fill those vacant slots the contracting company is going to charge a bigger premium for that labor than they are already going to charge. Normal contract labor costs employers about 3x-4x the cost of the normal employee in they says they use them, but when it's a 1 day it can be 6x-8x. And thats if they do it at all.

But they also need pay rises BECAUSE they don't have that work life balance. Factor it into hourly instead of salary and some of these teachers are making below the minimum wage.

Teachers have lost 23% in real-terms since 2010, and support staff 27% over the same period. The average 5% pay rise for teachers this year is some 7% behind inflation. In the midst of a cost of living crisis, that is an unsustainable situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Government must know there is going to have to be a correction on teacher pay. They must realise that school support staff need a pay rise.\u201d\n\nTeachers are striking for more money AND for that money to not be taken from school budgets. Talk about misinformation, eh? \n\nThe average salary for a teacher is apparently \u00a338k, which is a decent salary above the national average.

This means schools have to get that 5% extra from their budget. There are 150 teachers at my school. A 5% increase in pay from our already paltry budget is a TA salary, it is money removed from dept budgets, it is less books, it is buildings falling into disrepair, it is turning off the heating for a month, it is playing sports with equipment older than most parents, it is cutting science experiments, fewer school trips for low income students, fewer external visitors coming in to discuss their specialist areas. Workload will increase with this - as teachers are stretched increasingly thin with less support by the day. More staff will leave, fewer trainees will join the profession, workload will get heavier and heavier.

Teachers are exactly striking because the government hasn't funded the payrise, meaning that schools don't have the money to give them the pay rise they deserve and also have the equipment,TAs, etc they need to run properly. Schools were counting penny's before the government decided no money would be given for the pay rise, and it's completely insulting. The key point for the strike is a fully funded payrise yes, but it does also include everything we need for the work life balance to be less out of control - how exactly do you think the government is going to change the workload?

The union I'd be eligible to join go on strike pretty much every year to the point where it no longer has any impact.
