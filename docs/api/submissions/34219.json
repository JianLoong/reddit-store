Plus it settles the blame with the kid, and that just isn't where it should be.  \n\n\"You're right, Charlotte, we shouldn't ban an 8yo from family gatherings, because this isn't his fault, it's yours. Neither of you are welcome until you've worked out how to handle his behavior in a way that doesn't negatively impact the family and the general public.

You'd be helping his nervous system by at least not dragging him places that are going to overload his senses. \n\nIf that's not the case and he's just a brat who's never been disciplined, then she's also doing him no favors and you don't have to put up with her bad parenting. That's also not Leo's fault.", "NTA that behavior is unacceptable actions have consequences and he is more than old enough to understand he should not act like that.", "NTA. People will start to exclude her from all types of things because of her child\u2019s behaviour\u2026 you were just upfront about it instead of doing it behind her back.

Whether we like it or not, this round of kids are going to be behind in a lot of ways. They missed some crucial socialization time and my 8 year old is only just now understanding what being in a restaurant requires. He also has ADHD and is behind his peers in a lot of ways when it comes to social situations. That said, we also don\u2019t allow screens at restaurants which encourages them to talk to us, find out about the different cuisines and cultures we are experiencing, and enjoy each other\u2019s company.

Now family events shouldn\u2019t be his only experience of having to find ways to be still with his body, quiet with his voice, respectful of those around him. It takes a lot of work. The blame isn\u2019t on the 8 year old here, but your sister for not being proactive in helping him understand the nuance of social interactions. \n\nThats a boundary you can hold.

Children should not be expected to behave perfectly while dinning out however there should be the expectation of at least the attempt. Leo is 8. At that age he knows acting like a hooligan is not appropriate. Leo has no direction. His mother allows such poor behavior to save herself potential conflict were she to actually parent her child. She is doing Leo a great disservice,  creating a demanding self absorbed individual that will later be crushed when he learns the hard way the world doesn't revolve around him.", "NTA.  This is not normal kid behaviour - at 8 they should be able to sit still for a dinner.   This is poor discipline from his parents - they haven't helped him learn any self restraint.

Same principle applies. He has \"social shit\" all over him.", "NTA  Are the ones who said it was normal kid behavior childless or have children just like him?

Because his mom established early that home is his safe place to be who he is, but when he is in public, he has got to behave in a socially acceptable manner. When he was tiny, she just learned his signs of being overstimulated or over tired (which can lead to a melt down) and got preemptive about taking him outside to chill/run around for a bit to keep him on an even keel... sometimes, she leaves early if she knows he is nearing his limit or if something triggers him, but she doesn't allow him to disrupt others. \n\nI know that not every kid is the same and that your description of events could possibly have been exaggerated,  but she could be doing better or taking him out of the situation when trying isn't working.", "I have two 8 year old  grandsons.

Also, the fact that Charlotte is just ignoring the behavior does make it seem like a parenting issue, that is also not his fault. Maybe being around family that knows how to behave properly would be the best way for him to actually learn the proper way to behave in public. Seems like Charlotte didn't have an issue with other people intervening. Maybe she's just overwhelmed? Where is the dad? Is he recently out of the picture?

Who are you, some kind of millionaire that tries to buy his family\u2019s affection? It\u2019s not the fact that you do it, it\u2019s the fact you had to mention it that makes you out to be the asshole. A non-asshole would probably leave this detail out and just say something like \u201cI was out to dinner with the family recently\u2026\u201d\n\n2. \u201cLeo is 8 but acting like some kind of 2 year old\u201d. I mean seriously, who can take you seriously after this sentence? The kid is 8 - he hardly knows wrong from right. Sounds like he either has a learning / behaviour issue like ADHD or she is a single parent struggling to care for a problem child (I assume she\u2019s a single parent as you didn\u2019t mention the father in the post). How about you support your sister and try and help? Banning an 8 year old from anything would seem extreme. \n\n3. Constantly referring to Leo as \u201cMy Nephew\u201d.  \u201cDiscipline my nephew\u201d, \u201cmy nephews behaviour\u201d. He is not yours, he\u2019s an 8 year old kid doing what 8 year old kids typically do when they are bored at a restaurant. While technically yes he\u2019s your nephew, the way you phrase it like he is your possession is very pompous and asshole-y. \n\n4. \u201cI could hear Leo yelling in the background\u201d. Have you never been in a car with an 8 year old before? All they do is yell! It\u2019s like trying to tame a caged lion. Essentially you are trying to lock into a small space a giant ball of energy - it\u2019s always going to be a challenge. Then, imagine ignoring that ball of attention seeking energy by being on the phone. Good luck with that. \n\n5. \u201cIf Charlotte doesn\u2019t want to hurt Leo\u2019s feelings\u201d. What a dumb thing to say. What mum wants to hurt their child\u2019s feelings? Better yet, what uncle wants to hurt their (read My) nephew? Get a grip mate, you\u2019re talking tough about an 8 year old\u2026.\n\n6. \u201cOur parents understandably asked not to get involved in our disagreement\u201d. This doesn\u2019t really make you sound like the asshole, but it definitely makes your parents sound like it. They clearly don\u2019t know how to raise a child that would grow to be an adult who showed empathy and support to an 8 year old boy. They also don\u2019t seem to want to support their daughter or grandson - isn\u2019t that what grandparents are for??\n\nWhat you should have done, post this little event that you so graciously hosted for the family, is speak to Charlotte about your concerns, let her know you were upset by his behaviour (which is probably not unreasonable) and asked if there was anything you can do to help. Perhaps you could have discussed some more child friendly options to for the next family get-together? Maybe a place with a play ground or something? You make it out like you were at some fine dining restaurant, somewhere many adults would struggle to behave at!\n\nBut alas, I believe you took the asshole route and straight up banned a child from your family events. It\u2019s a shame, but I think Leo is probably better off not going to your events anyway, they sound like a bore!", "ESH, mostly you. I\u2019d like to see Charlotte doing a bit more to discipline Leo, but you went from 0 to nuclear without working your way up.\n\nYou\u2019ve only given one example of actual (potentially) harmful behaviour - throwing bread at a service dog - for which he was promptly halted by your dad, though it would have been better if his mother did it. Jumping up and down to get mom\u2019s attention, and trying to get her attention while she\u2019s on the phone, are not necessarily the *best* things kids do, but are well into the realm of normal childhood behaviour. Slightly annoying, yes, but not something to exclude a child for. \n\nThe throwing bread thing, admittedly not great, though you don\u2019t say whether he was trying to hurt the dog or feed the dog. If it\u2019s the former (was it a whole loaf of bread?) that\u2019s a different matter than if it was the latter. If he was bored and trying to feed the dog, that doesn\u2019t even require a telling-off, just an explanation that we don\u2019t feed other people\u2019s dogs, particularly when they\u2019re working.\n\nFrankly, you sound like you hate and/or resent Leo and are trying to manufacture reasons for him not to be around.

Sesame Street is so good, they get some premium guest stars\ud83e\udd23 I also try to watch it with her so we can talk about it and reference stuff from the episode later. \n\nI was a teacher and so I learned a lot about finding root causes for behavior and it\u2019s such a game changer when you solve behavior for the cause not the symptom.

He learned eventually. We are all good now.", "Yeah, I get that but I understand OP\u2019s frustration too. The mom just needs to be willing to actually say what she\u2019d need, not bury her head.
