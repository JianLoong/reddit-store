Plus it settles the blame with the kid, and that just isn't where it should be.  \n\n\"You're right, Charlotte, we shouldn't ban an 8yo from family gatherings, because this isn't his fault, it's yours. Neither of you are welcome until you've worked out how to handle his behavior in a way that doesn't negatively impact the family and the general public.

You'd be helping his nervous system by at least not dragging him places that are going to overload his senses. \n\nIf that's not the case and he's just a brat who's never been disciplined, then she's also doing him no favors and you don't have to put up with her bad parenting. That's also not Leo's fault.", "NTA that behavior is unacceptable actions have consequences and he is more than old enough to understand he should not act like that.", "NTA. People will start to exclude her from all types of things because of her child\u2019s behaviour\u2026 you were just upfront about it instead of doing it behind her back.

Whether we like it or not, this round of kids are going to be behind in a lot of ways. They missed some crucial socialization time and my 8 year old is only just now understanding what being in a restaurant requires. He also has ADHD and is behind his peers in a lot of ways when it comes to social situations. That said, we also don\u2019t allow screens at restaurants which encourages them to talk to us, find out about the different cuisines and cultures we are experiencing, and enjoy each other\u2019s company.

Now family events shouldn\u2019t be his only experience of having to find ways to be still with his body, quiet with his voice, respectful of those around him. It takes a lot of work. The blame isn\u2019t on the 8 year old here, but your sister for not being proactive in helping him understand the nuance of social interactions. \n\nThats a boundary you can hold.

Children should not be expected to behave perfectly while dinning out however there should be the expectation of at least the attempt. Leo is 8. At that age he knows acting like a hooligan is not appropriate. Leo has no direction. His mother allows such poor behavior to save herself potential conflict were she to actually parent her child. She is doing Leo a great disservice,  creating a demanding self absorbed individual that will later be crushed when he learns the hard way the world doesn't revolve around him.", "NTA.  This is not normal kid behaviour - at 8 they should be able to sit still for a dinner.   This is poor discipline from his parents - they haven't helped him learn any self restraint.

Same principle applies. He has \"social shit\" all over him.", "NTA  Are the ones who said it was normal kid behavior childless or have children just like him?

Because his mom established early that home is his safe place to be who he is, but when he is in public, he has got to behave in a socially acceptable manner. When he was tiny, she just learned his signs of being overstimulated or over tired (which can lead to a melt down) and got preemptive about taking him outside to chill/run around for a bit to keep him on an even keel... sometimes, she leaves early if she knows he is nearing his limit or if something triggers him, but she doesn't allow him to disrupt others. \n\nI know that not every kid is the same and that your description of events could possibly have been exaggerated,  but she could be doing better or taking him out of the situation when trying isn't working.", "I have two 8 year old  grandsons.

Also, the fact that Charlotte is just ignoring the behavior does make it seem like a parenting issue, that is also not his fault. Maybe being around family that knows how to behave properly would be the best way for him to actually learn the proper way to behave in public. Seems like Charlotte didn't have an issue with other people intervening. Maybe she's just overwhelmed? Where is the dad? Is he recently out of the picture?

If a kid is interested, and you give them the tools and help, they can do it.\n\nOP, A parent  needs to know what their kid can tolerate, how they will behave, and what the parent can do to facilitate their behavior so that the kid can go to fun places without annoying the crap out of everyone else.  **It\u2019s called parenting**!   Each of my kids had a solid 6 mos they couldn\u2019t go to restaurants.  Each was a different age.  They just couldn\u2019t manage the calm quiet required.  But they all got out of those stages.   Sometimes I had to do more work than others to help them keep their cool.  But, again, parenting.  NTA\n\nThen, walking back across Harvard Yard, the 3 kids sang, with their grandfather and Dad, at the top of their lungs, \u201cwith cat like tread\u2026\u201d they had a blast at that show. Well worth the work for making the memory!", "And neurodivergent people are not all the same. Just because you didn't behave as such doesn't mean there are those that haven't or do. Geez cool it with the ableist remarks. Now let's see Paul Allens card.", "Same here.  \nI have ADHD and my kids all have it as well, you plan around it but it never is an excuse for this kinda behaviour.   \nI just take my kids outside in between courses and let them run wild for a bit if the meal is a longer one. And there are always books or coloring books in a backpack if they want to fidget with something.", "I'm very concerned that it is so easy to jump on the spectrum and ADHD bandwagon - I suppose it's easier to blame a condition than it is to question your own parenting skills.\n\nMy sister's daughter was a nightmare from an early age. \"It's so hard to have a 2-year-old\", \"It's so hard to have a 3-year-old\" etc etc she would say. The attention seeking ruined every family gathering but luckily if it didn't work she's run to the bathroom and shout and scream at how unfair everyone was. At least it was out of earshot. \n\nRule no. 1 - don't negotiate. You can't reason with a child. If a child is reaching for a hot burner the word is **NO**, not \"*please don't do that.*...\"", "Same! I think the worst thing my Au kid did was throw cheerios on the floor  but he was like <2yo and I tried to pick up as much as I could lol.", "My oldest just turned 8, has ADHD, and is also unmedicated. She does *not* behave like this! My 5 year old who has lots and lots of big feelings and has no issue expressing them (and who I suspect also has ADHD), doesn\u2019t particularly like being in public, and doesn\u2019t really like people in general does not behave like this. Hell my 8 month old doesn\u2019t behave like this. It\u2019s just Leo. And Charlotte\u2019s lack of parenting. If my kids had thrown bread at ALL we would have left. \nJeebus. NTA.", "I've noticed many kids who go to church are just more used to having to behave in public, assuming good parenting. If I wasn't a complete non-believer, I would take my kid just for that reason! However, we do take him to restaurants (mostly well-behaved, with glitches to bad behaviour every few months due to developmental leaps), concerts, dance classes and socials (These overwhelm him sometimes), and a few choir rehearsals. Overall, even when we think he's being an absolute threenager, we have a lot of comments on how well-behaved he is. Active parenting and constant exposure are the only solutions.\n\nPretty sure he has adhd though. Parenting on hard mode!", "That's not a good thing.  Children should be children.  They shouldn't be scared to move at an event.  They shouldn't be acting like adults at 4 years old.  The only way children behave like this is by threat or yelling.  Kids shouldn't be scared to be kids.", "Are you me cause unfortunately same", "I kind of agree. And I also believe he is minimizing his own actual behavior here. Everyone does. \n\nIt was a bad, bad day for a little kid. Show some grace.", "Yes they are but this is not ok behavior. \n\nHe's 8", "Sorry, an 8YO was just a preschooler that didn\u2019t know any difference during the \u2018pandemic\u2019. My 7 and 10 YO are just fine the 18 and 14 YO are suffering. This is just lazy parenting.", "That doesn\u2019t mean your sister can just continue behaving in such a way, does it?", "So the kid has to have a developmental disorder just to act like a kid?\n\nHe was bouncing on the seats?  Normal\n\nYelling for mom's attention?  Normal\n\nThrowing bread to a random dog? Normal\n\nAll of these behaviors are easily corrected with a little direction.  But you can't expect children to behave like adults and sit quietly the whole time.", "People like to give the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAnd undiagnosed conditions aren't exactly uncommon.\n\nMany people getting to adulthood without a diagnosis.", "This generation think everyone is undiagnosed with some buzzword that they dont truly understand. I don't know why it matters what he has or not, this is just useless parenting. The only mistake he made was banning Leo when he should have banned the mum. Labelling it that way may have helped with how its received (doubtful but maybe his friends would understand better). \"I won't be inviting you until you demonstrate you've taken steps to manage your sons behaviour\"", "Absolutely I agree with you (for most children in most situations), conditional on IF sister was trying to calm and center her child in the moment, but she seems fine with the behaviour, and seems to instead enable the behaviour. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it wrong to ban child? maybe, but why are other people responsible if Sister won't do the basics?", "Beautiful. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that the go to is \u201cban\u201d the kid instead of offering help. She moved there to be closer to family makes this more of a shame. \n\nMaybe Leo could use an uncle right now", "This sounds like a bit of a reach. A two year ripple isn\u2019t enough to have any long-term effect on children who are properly raised.  What we see is a growing number of \u201cparents\u201d who are not enamored with parenthood taking any opportunity to avoid the real work involved.  The pandemic is just another excuse for lazy parents.", "I like her. My son has a friend like her, who in the same circumstances has raised a gorgeous young man. \n\nLike another post I just read where aunts think their Angels can scream and destroy and wonder why they aren't welcome at events.", "Well said. I trained my kids in restaurant behavior beginning at 18 months. We started with McDonald's at off hours and graduated to family dining restaurants within a couple of months. It was a solo time with mom. It worked very well. By age 2, they were experts.", "I think their idea is if she disinvites her sister, her nephew naturally wouldn't come either. It's just making a point that the boundary should be towards the sister for her bad parenting, rather than towards her son, because her sister is causing his behavior. And hopefully it would be a wakeup call to her. \n\nAlso it's entirely not op's responsibility to watch her nephew, but he's acting crazy because his mom is allowing it. If another adult was watching him and didn't allow him to get away with anything, there's a good chance he would behave much better.", "Quick glance at your profile...proudly childless. Sit down. You have no leg to stand on anyway.", "I think at that point as a patron I would have chewed out those people in a big, very public way so as to embarrass the crap out of them. Then I\u2019d ask the restaurant to move us as far away as possible from the family of Neanderthals.", "This is what got me! That OPd sister did shit to stop that! My children knew at 2yo when they were toddling not to approach dogs in general. I just said sometimes dogs in public are working and when we saw a dog in public took it as a learning moment. \"Look at that dog working so hard, helping that man see! No, you can't pet him he's a working dog\" it took a little work but they learned \n\nOPs nephew is just fucking feral. He's been allowed to run OPs sister and it shows. There's no mention of a BIL so I'm assuming OP is a single mom. Being a single mom is hard as you have to be both nurturing your child and the one responsible for all the discipline of said child. You have to find a balance, none of my children ever behaved this way.\n\nMy middle daughter was a wild child and very precocious, often saying inappropriate things in public. She'd question authority and reasoning behind why she wasn't allowed to do certain things, which I applauded, nobody wants to raise someone who questions nothing. I have a niece and nephew who lost their mother at 3 and 5 who never acted this way. My nephew especially had a difficult time with his mother passing and was and is prone to getting over stimulated and upset.\n\nOPs nephew is an example of a totally and wholly spoiled child. He needs training like a dog to know how to behave. You wouldn't take an animal who was uncontrolled around others into public, likely you shouldn't take a child out who cannot behave in public", "Right. All 3 of my kids are neurodivergent and at age 3 were well behaved in public. No one should have to put up with some brat ruining their meal or whatever because the parents are negligent.", "My son has Autism and ADHD and we used to pack our food up and leave the restaurant when he was younger and would throw a tantrum. I was a helicopter mom and was always on top of his behavior when we went out. We would bring noise canceling headphones, iPads, or whatever was needed to help keep him busy and not disturb others. Just because he has a disability doesn\u2019t give him permission to act like an asshole. We were never that inconsiderate of other diners.

I think it would be good for OP\u2019s sister and nephew to spend time with family so that other adults can help correct the kid, but not right to use a public setting as the venue.
