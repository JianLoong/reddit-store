If you bother to read her comments you would have read that her mother prioritises the other kids above her, Only have food the others prefer and mother asks OP to ask her father for money so she can use it. OP is feeling neglected but you\u2019re calling her a little shit.", "Instead of saying \"Hey mom, i'm sorry but me and dad already have plans. You can pick me up after/before though and we can watch a movie or just hang out\"\n\nEasy, boom. Simple.   \nBoth parents are taken into consideration.", "You are lame. LMAOAOAO LAMEST 16 YEAR OLD", "Can you imagine how that call went with your aunt on your mom\u2019s end? What must your mom have sounded like to make your aunt type that? Do you think she called her up to bitch? Or do you think she called her sister in tears?", "you\u2019re the most awful child ever. Like you\u2019re going to turn out horrible and spoiled. Hope the whole of your moms side cut you off. And when daddy stops giving money you\u2019ll see the real world.", "HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA", "So she\u2019s resentful because her mother prioritises her siblings ?", "\u201ci really don\u2019t understand the lack of tact\u201d from a 16 year old?? you really can\u2019t wrap your head around that? especially a 16 year old with a broken family?", "ACTUAL B*TCHHHH", "She\u2019s funny \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No she loves daddy more because he prioritised her and doesn\u2019t ignore her around the other kids. Father also doesn\u2019t ask his daughter to ask her mother for money so father can use it.", "OP, you seriously gotta pick a story and stick to it. Either your mom *has* the money and is making the *choice* not to spend it on you or she *does not* have the money and cannot afford it. You\u2019ve made both of those claims throughout your responses. Make a decision. One or the other.", "Golly, then that changes it a bit. Those details weren\u2019t provided at the time my post was made so the parents are the true AH.", "It\u2019s the mothers weekend not the fathers. So the father could do it on another day.", "You know your dad can take you to a birthday dinner any other day. Your mom genuinely wants to spend it with you. Grow up.", "This is. They\u2019re calling a 16 year old girl an asshole just because she prefers to go out for her birthday. However, OP could have let down her mother better.", "Lol her mom values her other siblings than her and then gets upset when her kid would rather spend it with someone who will focus on just her on her BIRTHDAY.  Good lord.  She might be a bratty teen but you guys are defending kind of a crap mom", "Idk how to on here but you can see it by clicking on her profile and it\u2019s one of her comments in the comment section", "That's a bit unfair to the percentage of people with NPD who, out of cognitive understanding that they live in a society, choose to develop conducive skills and habits in how they treat others.", "Sounds like it.", "This is really harsh.

Maybe therapy will be nice, a talk with the mom to tell her all her feelings and her mom willing to change too. Otherwise,I only see things geting worse.", "Well we can\u2019t assess that because OP hasn\u2019t given any kind of info regarding that so I\u2019ll assume dad is ok.", "I don't think the dad needs to the mother does a good Job for this on her own. \n\n\"My mom doesn't buy anything my dad pays for everything also my mom's other kids are very picky so I'll end up eating their favorite food on my birthday as usual\"", "Is not stated and doesnt realy matter.", "So this is because you're an only child with your dad but not your mom? How sad you don't think she lives you just because she has other kids. In essence, you're punishing her for having other kids as well as not as much money as your dad. Sounds like you need to work this out with a therapist. For that reason, soft YTA. You really need to talk to your mom.", "Someone can love you and not have money to spend on you. It sounds like You have two parents that love you and want to spend time with you, and you are lucky for that. \nBut be careful about equating love with money. Money spent is only part of the story.", "your mom  also loves you too", "No, you're spending your birthday with the person who can spend stupid amounts of money on a fancy meal that can be had ANY day of the year.\n\nYou have some serious growing up to do if you think money = love.\n\nI hope you do learn the difference before someone takes advantage of you in the name of \"love\" just because you don't know the difference between a wallet and a heart.", "Yeah that\u2019s not the same \ud83d\ude2d.", "They have their moments.   \nMy kids met their estranged father last August, first time after eight years.   \nThe father was in town W-T-F-S-S.   \nthe girls went to meet him everyday after school, the situation was not easy and the father was glued to his phone. I tried to mediate.   \nOn Saturday, my son was released from the hospital, so he went with his sisters to meet his father as well.   \nThe father got bright and chatty, put away his phone and started asking questions. He promised my son a telly and a video game console (we have neither at home) if he would shop for them with him.  \nMy older daughter had grown uncomfortable with the situation and decided to cut the day short returning home, my son went with her for moral support.  \nHe is 13, he still laments not having a video game console, of course, but he still thinks being there for his sister was more important.", "Especially 16 yr old girls. She\u2019s still learning though.", "the apple seldom falls far from the tree", "Then why does she force OP to only do things her other kids like or even spend one on one time with OP.  Go read OPs comments and it reveals a lot more than the post does.  Is OP a bratty teen yes, but who wasn't a bratty teen at one point in their lives.", "Yeah but she shouldn't be forcing to spend it with her and her step siblings.

Also she is very defensive with some humour and I\u2019ll attach that to being a teen and one who seems like she needs some help.", "Yes her comment of my mum and her kids, instead of my siblings was very telling.", "OP does have a job?", "Good son and brother!", "That's a testament to your parenting. I'm glad he supported his sister and he got to see that that's not how you treat your kids.", "OP isn't being a great kid but I don't agree that the aunt gets to be abusive. \n\nThe aunt IS being protective.of her sister, and I get that. I will get after my nieces/nephews when they're disrespectful to their mom (and vice versa) but you don't get to be abusive.", "I don't disagree with you in principle, but what the aunt said as presented in the OP wasn't necessarily abusive.\n\nIf someone's being an \"ungrateful asshole\", saying so isn't necessarily abusive.\n\nTelling someone they should treat their mother better isn't necessarily abusive.\n\nLecturing a child when they're being hurtful isn't necessarily abusive.\n\nI haven't exactly pored over OP's comments so I may have missed some detail on that count.", "do you love your dad more because he has more money", "Well.\n\nOP, I hope you grow up.
