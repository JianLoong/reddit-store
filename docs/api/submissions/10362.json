All of your friends will be the kind that will drop you in a heartbeat if you god forbid end up losing your wealth. Empty fake friendships. \n\nBut of course money facilitates happiness. Think about an artist with a fully equipped studio, or a fisherman that can travel to Costa Rica to fish. At the end of the day it\u2019s the fishing and the art that make them happy.
