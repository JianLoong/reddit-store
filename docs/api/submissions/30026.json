Our oldest is our son Jamie, then we have our daughter Casey and then our youngest is our son Riley. My husband is an amazing parent and one of the things I have always appreciated is the fact we are on the same page when it comes to parenting. It's something we discussed prior to marriage and kids but it has something that has remained true for us.\n\nOne element of parenting that my husband and I agree on is the sex of our child should not change our dynamic with them. My husband does not treat Casey differently to her brothers because she's a girl and his little princess or whatever. He cuddles and kisses all three. He comforts all three if they're crying. He is equally protective of all three. He's not harder on our boys, he's not rougher with them. He's not thinking ahead of any of the kids meeting a partner in the future and thinking about how he needs to intimidate these future people who come around. Not for our boys and not for our girl either. There's no difference at all. It's the same for me with my kids.\n\nBut his family finds it strange. He has stood up for himself and limited contact with them over it.\n\nBut it was his sister who came and asked me how I could let it happen, and how did I not find it weird and creepy that he's treating the boys like girls. She said it's so weird and that I never blink at it is even more weird to her. She said she could not imagine our boys growing up and my husband giving them hugs and kisses like he would our daughter. She said it's so uncomfortable and creepy. I pointed out I'm the same with all three and she said that's different. She called it weird and creepy again and said my husband's parenting is just weird and creepy. \n\nI told her I wanted him to be kind and loving to all our kids. She brushed me off and that's when I said that she might find my husband's parenting weird and creepy but I find hers weird and sad. Weird that the sex of the child dictates how they should be treated by a male parent and sad for the children who will grow up with that treatment. I told her I would never be able to see parenting the way she does. She did not take what I said well, which of course, and my husband decided after this to go no contact with his family because they all said I was awful for insulting them, which is how they took what I said.\n\nBut I just wonder if I should have kept it in and gone no contact without a retort back to SIL and if I'm TA?", "created_utc": 1698742505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kgkdm/aita_for_telling_my_sil_i_see_her_view_of/", "score": 2737, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Imagine growing up watching your sister getting showered in love and affection and you on the receiving end of \"tough love\". It causes a child to grow up questioning their existence, why don't they receive love where others in the same nest don't? They aren't able to understand the complex and backwards reasoning of adults as to why this happens, the child simply turns inwards - made to believe that this is the norm and so the cycle continues.", "NTA You and your husband are wonderful parents, and are great role models for your children.

This is the difference with raising ALL kids with hugs. Even if they stop on their own, they know that if they need it, you will always give them. \n\nAlso, don't be afraid to be rough with the girl as well. When I was little I was such a tomboy, climbing and jumping over things all the time, while my sister wanted her hair ties to match every part of her clothing.   \nIf the girl asks to be less rough, then you stop. \n\nBe cuddly and rough with all of them.", "NTA fabulous parenting and fabulous teamwork with your hubby!\n\nI liked what you added too, FYI, that you talked about your views before having kids but that it has stayed true.

So basically your SIL is saying that your boys dont need to know they are loved and cherished but your daughter does?! No wonder so many men struggle with mental health and talking about feelings if this is how some people think. It is not weak for a man to show affection or cry! Frankly I applaud you and your husband for treating ALL your children equally and with such love. Myself and my hubby hug my parents when we visit, same with his family. We must be 'weird' too then?!

I see no reason why you shouldn't stand up for yourself and your husband against sexist and rude opinions.\n\nAs a man, I commend both of you for being just as caring and gentle towards the boys because it's a sad fact that most of us are treated very differently. I firmly believe it's one of the main reasons why so many boys end up feeling angry and/or frustrated in their teens. \n\nI'm not making any assumptions with my next comment or telling you how to parent, but I hope you'll find room in your approaches to also ensure your sons know how to cope with aggression and confrontation. It's an unavoidable aspect of being a boy/man and unfortunately turning the other cheek doesn't work. I'm not encouraging violence; only that they're equipped to stand up for themselves.

Because for me (I'm Italian) your story seemed very typically American. \n\nThe way you're parenting is the normal way I grew up and how I see my friends and relatives around Europe doing with their kids, regardless of their genders. I think most of us will find much weirder the way your SIL parents. How does that work? As a father you don't hug your son but only your daughter because that's how you treat only girls? That's sounds crazy to me but if that's the norm, it clarifies a lot of stuff I've seen and heard from other Americans.", "NTA \n\nSome people can only perpetuate the broken parenting styles that they themselves endured.

Our oldest is our son Jamie, then we have our daughter Casey and then our youngest is our son Riley. My husband is an amazing parent and one of the things I have always appreciated is the fact we are on the same page when it comes to parenting. It's something we discussed prior to marriage and kids but it has something that has remained true for us.\n\nOne element of parenting that my husband and I agree on is the sex of our child should not change our dynamic with them. My husband does not treat Casey differently to her brothers because she's a girl and his little princess or whatever. He cuddles and kisses all three. He comforts all three if they're crying. He is equally protective of all three. He's not harder on our boys, he's not rougher with them. He's not thinking ahead of any of the kids meeting a partner in the future and thinking about how he needs to intimidate these future people who come around. Not for our boys and not for our girl either. There's no difference at all. It's the same for me with my kids.\n\nBut his family finds it strange. He has stood up for himself and limited contact with them over it.\n\nBut it was his sister who came and asked me how I could let it happen, and how did I not find it weird and creepy that he's treating the boys like girls. She said it's so weird and that I never blink at it is even more weird to her. She said she could not imagine our boys growing up and my husband giving them hugs and kisses like he would our daughter. She said it's so uncomfortable and creepy. I pointed out I'm the same with all three and she said that's different. She called it weird and creepy again and said my husband's parenting is just weird and creepy. \n\nI told her I wanted him to be kind and loving to all our kids. She brushed me off and that's when I said that she might find my husband's parenting weird and creepy but I find hers weird and sad. Weird that the sex of the child dictates how they should be treated by a male parent and sad for the children who will grow up with that treatment. I told her I would never be able to see parenting the way she does. She did not take what I said well, which of course, and my husband decided after this to go no contact with his family because they all said I was awful for insulting them, which is how they took what I said.\n\nBut I just wonder if I should have kept it in and gone no contact without a retort back to SIL and if I'm TA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My daughters are super girly girls, but if we had a son, we'd still treat him the same and let HIM decide what he likes or doesn't like when it came to toys and clothes, those kinds of things.

The 8 year old is less inclined to sit on me now than the little one - but that is his choice as he gets older.\n\nThey still get told off and occasionally shouted at when they misbehave.
