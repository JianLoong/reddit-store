I refused to give up my seat to a woman on a flight", "selftext": "I (17F), my mom, my dad, and my sister took a flight to our homeland on Ryan air.

I said I wanted to sit next to my family and we specifically payed the extra fee to make sure we all sit on the end of the rows to prevent me from not feeling well and it will bring me comfort to sit next to my family ( I am a nervous flyer). I kindly refused her but she kept on insisting and I said no in a more sudden tone. She decides to reply with \u201cYou guys can see each other after anyway?\u201d. This had me fuming. \u201cAnd you could have payed the extra fee instead of arguing with me  ?\u201d I said angrily. A flight attendant came up to us and I explained the situation. She said that if I refuse to change seats there is nothing she can do and we need to sit down because we are about to take off. My final answer was no. If her husband wasn\u2019t there, fine but he was there to take care of the child and the baby. She goes back to her seat angrily and I sit down too. For those who don\u2019t know, a lap infant is a child under the age of 2 who don\u2019t qualify for their own seat yet. She could have easily just held the child herself at her seat if that\u2019s where the baby feels more comfortable in it\u2019s mothers arms instead she decides to cause a scene and keep on going back and fourth looking stressed to make me look like a bad person then she stands in the middle of the isle with her baby staring at me and blocking everyone way which made people more stressed at me because this hassle could have been easily avoided if I just agreed to switch my seat with her in other peoples isles. While holding her baby she made comments like \u201cit\u2019s okay don\u2019t cry, what can I do if this girl doesn\u2019t want to switch with me because she is nervous \u201c she said in a sarcastic tone.

That way if we were separated on the flight one parent wouldn\u2019t have to wrangle two (now three) small children by themselves. One time a family did switch their seats for us. They booked the aisle seats in the center section of the plane leaving the middle seat empty so they could have more room on an international flight. Didn\u2019t occur to them that the airline would probably fill that seat with a stand-by passenger. So my husband was assigned the seat between their kids while my 8 month old daughter (we were traveling with her car seat so put her in as a standby instead of lap child) was assigned the seat between the parents. Considering it was either take care of someone else\u2019s infant on the flight (Chicago to London)or switch their own kid into the middle seat they gladly offered to switch without us even asking.", "\"I, too, am a child /minor that wants to sit by my family and they paid to ensure seats that would allow that.\" NTA", "NTA\n\nYou were correct in what you said.\n\nYou weren't rude.\n\nSome people are just entitled and won't take no for an answer.", "Nobody was stressed at you,  they were annoyed at her.

You can easily move a baby but not the gear and stuff the baby needs, unless you want this couple to be moving under seat luggage over your head throughout the flight. You're NTA for not wanting to move. That's a choice and I won't judge you for it, but I will judge you and your family for being so fucking selfish.

What are you too do when a woman\u2019s too cheap to make sure she sits next to her baby?", "NTA. I don\u2019t know how this behaviour started but you are absolutely in the right.", "NTA. I flew recently, and discovered that if you want to sit in ANY aisle or window seat, you need to pay extra.

This is plane etiquette 101. \n\nStewie in Family Guy had a great line about this saying \"Your poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me.\" This was about an extra character that wanted to switch seats with him on the plane. \n\nIn your situation I would not have switched under any circumstances given how nervous you were, you may not have felt well during the flight, plus you paid extra for a specific seat. The only way I might have considered it is if you weren't as nervous as you claimed and the woman's seat was also an aisle seat. \n\nI had a woman try to take my window seat with two pre-teen kids in the row once. She wanted to sit next to her kids. And I was willing to work with her so I asked her, do you have a window seat? She said no. I told her she needs to move then (I said it nicer than that but made it clear I wanted to keep my seat). That was a 9-hour flight so I booked the window specifically to try to help myself sleep better. You have to offer at least a seat equivalent if you want to switch", "Of course NTA.

I don't understand why they think a stranger would be willing to accommodate them when they didn't accommodate themselves when booking.  I would not change my seat in your situation, and I suspect that most people wouldn't.  Regarding the people around you, I wonder if you were projecting the mom's behavior on to them.  Even if you weren't doing this, you were correct not to switch seats, and you don't have to justify yourself so the mom can make snide remarks concerning your justification.

I was first boarded on that particular flight and it was purely because I didn't want to directly address the behaviour (I am very avoidant with that kind of thing) but it was clear the attendant had clocked it.", "It really is a tax on families and it makes me so mad. I was flying solo with two small children and had a row for the 3 of us. The FA were throwing a stink about stuff and their grand solution was to put my 3 year old *by herself* in the row behind me with two strangers. They seemed like lovely people and were willing to do it, but *what the heck*??? You want me to just entrust my toddler into the care of random strangers? Are they (the airline) willing to take liability if harm came to my child from these people they wanted to force her to sit next to? \n\nSorry, veered off into another rant. But airlines are very anti-family and its not just convenience or desires of the family, its basic safety. Plus, can you imagine all the \"child free flight\" whiners if they had to sit next to a random small child because an airline refused to seat a parent next to their very young, minor child?", "It's particularly uncool to have badgered the OP, who is THEMSELF a kid. \n\nIt's not great to place or leave one parent separated from the other children, but that's on the airline, not the OP.", "I should have. Alas, it's 22 years too late. My grandmother had just died, and I was in no mood to put up with some AH's nonsense.", "Yep. I\u2019ve never been a victim (yet) but usually when any kind of disturbance arises the flight attendants will take care of it really fast. I\u2019m non confrontational too. Once some guy wouldn\u2019t put his laptop away for the flight and he made the mistake of refusing to when told to stow it away by a very burly, no nonsense male flight attendant. The attendant very sternly said he was going to stop the plane until he put it away and that\u2019s exactly what he did. The passenger was rightfully mortified and finally stashed it.", "This is 100% truth. On a recent long haul, the airline assigned my 2 year old across the aisle and 1 row back from me. So now I\u2019m an asshole if I don\u2019t pay extra to sit beside my *actual baby*? The airlines have successfully figured out a way to provide the most horrendous customer service possible while getting their passengers to blame each other for the airline\u2019s misdeeds. \n\nLike, someone at delta actually looked at our purchase and thought \u201chm, I\u2019ll put this person born in 2021 in a seperate row from the adult with the same surname who booked the two tickets. This is fine. We\u2019ll let the passengers duke it out at the gate.\u201d", "In this case, there was a parent (father) sitting with the older child and the mother was seated 3 rows up. The infant could have sat in either parent\u2019s lap. So there was no actual need to badger OP. Parents could also have switched seats as needed so that each one could rest while the other took over as needed.", "Hm. I'm not really sure. They weren't toddlers but they were both ten and under. It wasn't a great flight. They are both adults now but I remember thinking if I was sitting next to a kid and they were crying I'd switch with a parent.", "Damn, worse than Spirit? That\u2019s nightmare inducing.", "Ryanair (the airline in question) don't seperate kids and parents. If you book a kid ticket, the adult seat has to be next to the kid seat. Which it was in this case - its just that both adults weren't next to the kids, only one.", "I hope you said something to the baby like \u201csee child?  This is what life is like when you\u2019re a cheapskate!\u201d", "NTA. It's really sad that people like that lady try to take advantage of other people who don't know any better or who are more timid. Just imagine if there was a duplicate of that lady and she asked herself to move. They would've either started an all out brawl or passive aggressively said shit to each other the entire flight. Fuck her entitlement.", "A co-worker of mine is always determined to get the cheapest flights possible.  Often that means he books on third party sites that don't guarantee seats.  So when he and his wife and two daughters show up the airport they have to scramble to get the seats together.  To me, it is stupid to save a few dollars but then make the airline staff or other passengers miserable.", "You would survive the luggage issue.\n\n> therefore needing to wait for EVERYONE to get off before I can get to it again\n\nThat, is kinda precious.\n\nI think the OP's issue, nerves, was a much more legitimate reason.", "That happened to me when flying with my 18 month old son. We had paid extra for seats together because, duh. But at the last minute the airline had to switch to a different type of plane and we were seated about 18 rows apart. The airline would do NOTHING and told us to ask the passengers if anyone was willing to switch. This was the last leg of a long trip and I was not at my best. Kiddo and I both had isle seats so I plopped my toddler down in his back of the plane seat, and told the gentleman in the middle seat next to him \"Here's the deal. The airline fucked me over by switching our seats at the last minute and refusing to fix it. You now have a choice, sit in a middle seat next to my unattended toddler, or take my isle seat up front.\" He was not happy, but chose the latter option. I hate airlines.", "Same here, I have a 17 year old daughter and the woman would have gotten an ear full.", "I have literally had someone ask that. Wanted to swap with me from their coach seat because they needed \u201cmore room\u201d. \n\nYeah, that did not end well for them.", "Plus the very basic security issue of random people having access to your a young child while their parents are off somewhere else. Or what if the child is in trouble or gets sick, is the random seatmate responsible for the child? Who is liable if their parent is seated somewhere else?", "Fair enough, I wouldn't say they should have but if they had, I wouldn't say they're wrong in doing so either.", "Not saying they are wrong, just feel they could have done more when OP didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough to do it. Though they could have thought it was enough at that point of time and no reason to escalate matters"]}
