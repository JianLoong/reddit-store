I refused to give up my seat to a woman on a flight", "selftext": "I (17F), my mom, my dad, and my sister took a flight to our homeland on Ryan air.

I said I wanted to sit next to my family and we specifically payed the extra fee to make sure we all sit on the end of the rows to prevent me from not feeling well and it will bring me comfort to sit next to my family ( I am a nervous flyer). I kindly refused her but she kept on insisting and I said no in a more sudden tone. She decides to reply with \u201cYou guys can see each other after anyway?\u201d. This had me fuming. \u201cAnd you could have payed the extra fee instead of arguing with me  ?\u201d I said angrily. A flight attendant came up to us and I explained the situation. She said that if I refuse to change seats there is nothing she can do and we need to sit down because we are about to take off. My final answer was no. If her husband wasn\u2019t there, fine but he was there to take care of the child and the baby. She goes back to her seat angrily and I sit down too. For those who don\u2019t know, a lap infant is a child under the age of 2 who don\u2019t qualify for their own seat yet. She could have easily just held the child herself at her seat if that\u2019s where the baby feels more comfortable in it\u2019s mothers arms instead she decides to cause a scene and keep on going back and fourth looking stressed to make me look like a bad person then she stands in the middle of the isle with her baby staring at me and blocking everyone way which made people more stressed at me because this hassle could have been easily avoided if I just agreed to switch my seat with her in other peoples isles. While holding her baby she made comments like \u201cit\u2019s okay don\u2019t cry, what can I do if this girl doesn\u2019t want to switch with me because she is nervous \u201c she said in a sarcastic tone.

I would never asked anyone to switch seats. We always planned ahead and assigned \u201cairplane buddies\u201d. I\u2019d be in charge of one kid and he\u2019d be in charge of the other. That way if we were separated on the flight one parent wouldn\u2019t have to wrangle two (now three) small children by themselves. One time a family did switch their seats for us. They booked the aisle seats in the center section of the plane leaving the middle seat empty so they could have more room on an international flight. Didn\u2019t occur to them that the airline would probably fill that seat with a stand-by passenger. So my husband was assigned the seat between their kids while my 8 month old daughter (we were traveling with her car seat so put her in as a standby instead of lap child) was assigned the seat between the parents. Considering it was either take care of someone else\u2019s infant on the flight (Chicago to London)or switch their own kid into the middle seat they gladly offered to switch without us even asking.", "\"I, too, am a child /minor that wants to sit by my family and they paid to ensure seats that would allow that.\" NTA", "NTA\n\nYou were correct in what you said.\n\nYou weren't rude.\n\nSome people are just entitled and won't take no for an answer.", "Nobody was stressed at you,  they were annoyed at her.

You can easily move a baby but not the gear and stuff the baby needs, unless you want this couple to be moving under seat luggage over your head throughout the flight. You're NTA for not wanting to move. That's a choice and I won't judge you for it, but I will judge you and your family for being so fucking selfish.

What are you too do when a woman\u2019s too cheap to make sure she sits next to her baby?", "NTA. I don\u2019t know how this behaviour started but you are absolutely in the right.", "NTA. I flew recently, and discovered that if you want to sit in ANY aisle or window seat, you need to pay extra.

This is plane etiquette 101. \n\nStewie in Family Guy had a great line about this saying \"Your poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me.\" This was about an extra character that wanted to switch seats with him on the plane. \n\nIn your situation I would not have switched under any circumstances given how nervous you were, you may not have felt well during the flight, plus you paid extra for a specific seat. The only way I might have considered it is if you weren't as nervous as you claimed and the woman's seat was also an aisle seat. \n\nI had a woman try to take my window seat with two pre-teen kids in the row once. She wanted to sit next to her kids. And I was willing to work with her so I asked her, do you have a window seat? She said no. I told her she needs to move then (I said it nicer than that but made it clear I wanted to keep my seat). That was a 9-hour flight so I booked the window specifically to try to help myself sleep better. You have to offer at least a seat equivalent if you want to switch", "Of course NTA.

Why didn't they reserve seats together when they booked the flight?  If the baby wants mom, she can sit on mom's lap, or mom and dad could switch seats.  I don't understand why they think a stranger would be willing to accommodate them when they didn't accommodate themselves when booking.  I would not change my seat in your situation, and I suspect that most people wouldn't.  Regarding the people around you, I wonder if you were projecting the mom's behavior on to them.  Even if you weren't doing this, you were correct not to switch seats, and you don't have to justify yourself so the mom can make snide remarks concerning your justification.
