I leaned over her to get a better look at her screen (we share one large screen at our workstation).

The rest of the day was a bit awkward, but I chalked that up to it being a potentially uncomfortable situation.\n\nThis morning, however, I was called into HR.

I thought I was just expressing interest in a respectful way, but I realize now that the situation could be perceived differently.\n\nI want to stress here that I had no intentions of making her feel uncomfortable or pressured. It was not my intention to invade her personal space or to objectify her. I simply thought we had a connection and wanted to explore that outside of work.

Doing so in the middle of working with her while in her physical space is not it. \n\nYou need to consider WHY she felt uncomfortable to report you to HR. You created a situation when asking her out where she was physically trapped. You asked her out in a situation where she was taken off guard, where the moment did NOT call for that. \n\nYou also need to realize why she went to HR and why it was an appropriate reaction for her. There are many situations where men will ask their female employees and, if these women reject the men, it often doesn't work out to well for the women, especially in male-dominated industries. You put her in a position where she had very little control over the situation. She does not know you that well, so she has no idea how you would react to a rejection. You may know your response, but she doesn't. If she rejected you, she has to consider the possibility that you can react negatively. From taking it out on her through her work to spreading lies around the office about her to turning violent, these are all possibilities she has to face, even if you were never going to escalate it to any of those situations. Why? Because those situations happen ALL the time, especially in the tech industry. \n\nSo be mindful of this before you throw judgment on her for her reaction. She was thinking about her personal safety. \n\nAlso, just something to note: just because a woman is friendly toward you, it doesn't mean she's interested. Yes, there's obviously a time and place to try asking her out, but if you think she's interested only because she laughed at your jokes, you need to rethink that. \n\nI hope you take all of this and apply it to future situations and really consider when it's appropriate to ask any woman out (and it's not in the middle of work when you've physically cornered her).", "YTA.

They don't mind being told that their code sucks--and they can dish it out as well as everyone else.\n\nWhat we all hated--without any gender preference--were women ***AND MEN*** who couldn't push back, who were sensitive about criticism, who saw every action as some infringement upon their sovereign identity, and every joke as some microaggression.  A successful startup is an elite space.  What we don't have time for is nonsense--whatever your gender.\n\nAnd, speaking of elite spaces, this is precisely the same kind of terrible argument that make people hesitate to put women in combat roles in the military.  It's absolutely not about their capabilities.  Imagine being in combat, and having to ask someone: \"Hey, is it okay if I jump in this foxhole with you?

Just look at other political spaces.  We had bad behavior.  Then we had \"woke\".  And we're approaching \"post-woke\" now.\n\nThe fact that we have to make all these allowances--by default--makes it harder to do work, because I have to spend time thinking about people being comfortable.  Every workplace suddenly became less efficient.\n\nAnd you are (wrongly) conflating two issues.  All people (not just women) have the right to seek help--and be supported--if they have real issues.

We noticed it during the interviews, but their skills were great.  We thought we could deal with it.  People were happy to accommodate, up to a point.  But, when it started affecting how everyone worked, we realized it wasn't going to be scalable to treat all issues by union'ing them together, and taking the lowest fucking denominator.  And this was long before WFH was any kind of social normal.  But we offered it to this guy.  Guess what?  Phenomenal success.  He was fine and comfortable, we could go back to being normal and not having to wash our hands in his view before having meetings (we literally tried this for a while, and patted ourselves on the back for being so \"progressive\" (-ly stupid)).\n\nSo, hypothetically, if someone has an issue with being close, they need to say so.  If her issues is needing so much space that we can't work in her cube comfortably, she doesn't get an office and we don't ask everyone to change their DEFAULT behaviors to accommodate her.  We simply give her an option to work in a different setting, so ***SHE*** doesn't ***DISRUPT*** everyone else.\n\nWhat we are doing now, as a society, is trying to change EVERYONE ELSE'S DEFAULTS.
