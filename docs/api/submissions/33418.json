He fell out with his mom for a while after she disrespected the both of us about our wedding/engagement and shouted and swore at me. \n\nThey have seen each other a few times and spoke since but she\u2019s refused to apologize to me and I\u2019ve let him know that I\u2019m still really upset about how the situation was left. \n\nSince he moved in my family asked him to spend Christmas with us. My parents bought him his favorite chocolate and have been asking me how he likes his Christmas dinner so he\u2019ll feel more comfortable as it\u2019s his first Christmas away from home. \n\nI asked him at the start of December to go home and find out what is their plan for Christmas. I told him if he wants to go or stay here he needs to let my family know. He never went home he just agreed to stay here for Christmas . So we made our Christmas plans with my family.  \n\nToday, the 20th of December he told me that he went home to vist his family. I asked him how it went and he said he won\u2019t be spending Christmas here he\u2019ll be with his mom and brothers. I told him he already made plans with my family and they\u2019ve bought everything you can\u2019t change plans 5 days before Christmas. Especially after me asking him to figure out his plans 4 weeks ago. \n\nI completely understand wanting to be with your family at Christmas but I think it\u2019s disrespectful to my parents after letting him live here and doing loads for us. My mom sometimes makes us dinners and my dad is always looking out for him. I don\u2019t know how to tell my parents because I know they\u2019ll be a little annoyed/offended after we asked him multiple times is he sure he wants to stay here for Christmas. We haven\u2019t spoke because I just honestly don\u2019t know what to say to him because he\u2019s put me in an awkward situation of having to tell my family after everything has been planned and bought. \n\nAm I the asshole for being annoyed he\u2019s not sticking to our original plan?", "created_utc": 1703074707, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mtanb/aita_for_being_annoyed_my_fianc\u00e9_is_going_home/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get he wants to spend time with his family, but he\u2019s completely dismissing your one in the process. NTA.", "NTA. Though to be fair, he's only an AH for telling you so last minute. He has the right to change his mind. Christmas is big deal, so it's understandable he wants to spend it with his family even if his mom sounds horrid. \n\nBut tell him to break the news to your parents himself. In that case you won't have to feel bad, and he probably will learn to not make last minute decisions like this in the future.", "NTA, this is not even a case of him trying to fix things with his family, if it was his mother would have apologised & you would have been invited there.  \n\n\nI suspect like it or not, as long as in this relationship his mother will try to come between you & this may be part of that plan.", "NTA\n\nTell him he is the one that needs to tell your parents he is cancelling on them. Make sure he understand that this is on him and he needs to explain to them why he will not be there!\n\nTBH you should be considering if you want him as a Fianc\u00e9 and him living with you as well.", "No ages mentioned.\n\nYou both seem to young to be engaged.", "How old are you guys?", "Yta", "NTA. Plans were made based on his responses. He should have at least said that he was considering going there for Christmas. He needs to be the one to tell your parents that he's not staying with your family this time.", "Info, how old are you two?", "Reluctant ESH, though my real feelings aren't that harsh, but it's the language we have here...\n\nIt's more \"everyone is communicating badly and doesn't sound ready for marriage.\"  You and your fiance don't seem to be functioning as a team at all, you both seem focused on your own priorities.  You both should be placing greater value on the others relationship to their family.  I also wondered how old you were, I would have guessed 18/19.  Don't rush to the altar, take some time to make sure you two can find a way to really work as a partnership.", "NTA. Also, it's his responsibility to tell your parents, not yours.", "NTA - but this is a tough situation for everyone.  It sounds like your husband is trying to mend his relationship with this mother, and for some people, the holidays is the best time to do that.", "He should tell your mum and dad that he has decided to go home with his family and apologise for the last minute change. Then its c'est la vie", "YTA\n\nYou're very fixated on the lack of notice, but in this case, that's not really causing you or your family any big hardships. You are just having Christmas at home. It's not like someone is out the price of a plane ticket or someone didn't get a spot at a vacation destination because your boyfriend took it up and then changed his mind. You are just disappointed because you'd expected to have him, and you are upset about the lack of apology from your future in-law.\n\nIf anything, your relationship with those in-laws should be the focus here. This is hopefully the start of a repair. If it's not and they are going to be hateful to you while he is friendly with them,  you should seriously reconsider the marriage. Let him go home and see what happens.", "Nta sit down and have a conversation about this again, red flag he\u2019s refusing to tell your parents and making you do it. I feel like when you become fianc\u00e9s it\u2019s expected to have Christmas together as a couple. Could he do both?", "NTA. I think it\u2019s the principle he broke which is the problem. After you see someone else going to various lengths and efforts to make you feel at home, you don\u2019t cancel last minute. Ever. Understanding that he wants to mend his relationship with his own family, he could have compromised and said he would go to his family\u2019s house the day after Xmas. Plenty of festive spirit still in the air.", "NTA. But you can try to be a bit more understanding of him trying to fix relations with his family. Based on how it\u2019s going he will probably be at your doorstep before too long. You have a right to be pissed since everything has been planned and arranged but you can choose to be gracious and accepting and see how warmly he responds to that.", "YTA - Dude wants to fix his family, yeah its a minor inconvenience that he changed plan so late but let that man go and be with his family. I'm sure your parents will understand and they probably knew it was coming.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should have given more notice but he spends all of his time with your family\u2026 he can take some time with his. Your parents will probably be annoyed but will probably also like alone time with you.", "\"I completely understand, but my family is more important than his\" is what this post read like. \"My fiance moved in with me, but now I will keep it hanging over his head as some forever-debt he has towards me\". \"I am in an awkward situation to tell my parents their soon to be son-in-law loves his own family more than ours\".  \nYTA if it isn't clear. Family is more important than plans. Your partner's feeling are more important than plans. If you can't understand this, maybe you two shouldn't be getting married.", "NTA. I can understand that he is building bridges with his family but he has made a commitment to you and your family. They took him in when he needed them to and he should show some appreciation. Especially as his mother still hasn\u2019t apologised to you and try to offer an olive branch in anyway.", "YTA.\n\nThis is clearly a chance for him to reconnect and maybe fux things with his mum and family. Why is yours more important?", "NAH. I can understand your frustration\u2026 but it\u2019s not about you really is it. And it\u2019s not like the consequences are dire. A bit of extra food? I don\u2019t imagine your mum and dad will be in tears at the table on Christmas Day. He\u2019s probably had a very rough couple of weeks. Now is the time to be supportive and loving.", "Hold on: you expect him to rebuff the offer to fix things with his family in order to soend time with hers? If she and her family care they would 100% see why he needs to jump at this chance.", "This so how I\u2019m sort of seeing things.. but I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions", "25 going on 26 been together nearly 10 years", "We\u2019re 25 nearly 26!", "Fair", "25 going on 26 nearly together 10 years. I should have stated", "Oh no we\u2019re 25 going on 26!", "Been together nearly 10 years.", "Some relationships dont need mending. The ones where the mothers expect to be the only woman in their son's lives for instance.", "I suppose it doesn\u2019t have to be as big of a deal when you put it this way. Thank you", "I hate this \u201clet him go home\u201d he\u2019s his own person. I\u2019m annoyed that I\u2019m the one who has to tell my parents as he feels he doesn\u2019t have to. I completely understand wanting to be with your own family 100%. But he can\u2019t disrespect mine at the same time. He needs to let them know!", "Exactly and I even offered to make plans with my family so he can go home Christmas Eve and he still declined!", "I can see where your coming from. Thanks for the advice !", "Completely fair but it shouldn\u2019t be left to me to tell my family for his last minute change of plans!", "Well sorry it is about me when my family have taken him in and spent money and effort on Chris for him to make HIM feel comfortable and to turn around and tell me I have to deal with it \ud83d\ude02 clearly you haven\u2019t been in a relationships", "Wow wow wow. He got kicked out of his house for a bit of background. He would of been homeless. His family have treated him horribly and my family took him in. He\u2019s constantly saying he hates them and doesn\u2019t want to be around them. So the 360 turn was a bit of a shock. If he wants to go home for Christmas that\u2019s perfectly fine we had that conversation and he said no multiple times. It\u2019s that late notice and it feels disrespectful. So I don\u2019t think you should jump to conclusions", "This is what I\u2019ve been trying to say. You said it perfectly. Thank you!", "I think you took this the wrong way. My family is no more important than his. Him not visting his family is down to him and what\u2019s gone on with them. Im constantly in contact with his aunties and cousins! I can\u2019t force him to get in contact if he doesn\u2019t want to.", "I get that, and I hope he does work things out with his family, but if he\u2019s already made plans he could at least try to organise another time to catch up. I still feel he\u2019s being a little inconsiderate, even if it\u2019s so he can make amends.", "Ty", "OP you're NTA here. He's being completely inconsiderate to you and your family by doing this last minute and then not having the maturity to let your family know himself.\n\nWe all understand wanting to be with your family for the holidays-but what's going to happen when (if?) you're married? It's then a choice of yours, his, or you make it just the two of you.  There's an old Vince VAughn/Reese Witherspoon film called Four Families about trying to rush around and spend the holidays with everyone, and no one has any fun.\n\nYou and your fiance need to have a long hard look at things and talk about how you want to function as a couple.", "No, your fianc\u00e9 can tell them. He's a big boy, living in their home, why can't he tell them?", "I\u2019ve been in a tough position like this before, unfortunately it didn\u2019t go as I hoped and I spent New Years Eve swimming in my pool with my family and having a good ole time. Meanwhile he was at his place to \u2018fix things\u2019 with his family but instead the family argument turned violent that day lmaooo. Sometimes it\u2019s gotta be a tough hill to get over.  I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you :((", "I\u2019m actually in a 5 year one currently \u2026 he has the right to change his mind and you\u2019re making it seem like he owes your family for hospitality but if he\u2019s trying to fix his family situation then everyone should understand", "Exactly. It's down to what's best fir his family and him. \n\nYou want him to tell his mum, after she offered this olive branch, to refuse?", "I completely agree. Thank you for your advice. I\u2019ll get us both to sit down and give that a watch \ud83e\udee3", "This is what Im trying to say!!", "It\u2019s a horrible situation. Hopefully everything will turn out okay!", "No not at all. He\u2019s constantly saying he doesn\u2019t want to be around his family and isn\u2019t a massive fan of them so the 360 turn was a little shock", "Not at all. I want him to be the one to tell my family he won\u2019t be here and not be put in an awkward situation! I\u2019m more annoyed at the fact I have to tell them not that he want to go home.", "If it was an olive branch, OP would have been invited as well.", "He\u2019s trying to make amends w his family \u2026 sometimes being around other ppl family can make u feel that way .. be kind and think about he is feeling right now instead of concentrating on your feelings", "Ah, onnthat I agree. \n\nSorry your in this position.", "Why, if its a problem between him and his family? And even ifnylthers a problem with OP and his family, it's wisher to deal.with 2 issue at a time."]}
