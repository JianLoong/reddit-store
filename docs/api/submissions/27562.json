It was gifted to me by parents and grandparents. It's a 2bedroom apartment so i started renting the other bedroom to earn some more extra cash. Then my flatmate Sam(m28) moved in 8 months ago. He is good guy and we get along fine. Recently his gf Nina(f30) have started spending alot of time at our apartment. I don't have any problem with that because Nina is pretty chill women and she always brings food/drinks for us. \n\nThe only problem is she is very free spirited like she wears really less clothes. Like she will walk around the living room or sits on our couch with nothing but robe/tshirt and underwear and I work from home so stay home majority of the time so I see her in underwear watching tv or playing games on tv in our living room. I am not attracted to her on anything but the thought of her half naked ass on our shared furniture is just doesn't sit right with me. So I told Sam about this and he said he'll have chat with Nina. \n\nThis morning Nina was at our apartment and she said I was out of the line with my comments on her body. First I was confused because I didn't make any comments on her body and then she said 'if I had any problem with her i should have said something to her face to face instead of going behind her back'. I said you don't live here so I told Sam about this instead of you and then we had small argument about 'i making comment on her body'.

She\u2019s probably just upset because she is embarrassed.", "NTA\n\nIts perfectly fine to find someones half naked bare ass smudged up against your chairs gross.\n\nFrankly its your home. She shouldnt be arguing with you at all. Youve said nothing about her body or even modesty. Just that you dont like bare asses or smi bare asses on your furniture. Its a hygiene issue. Nothing more. She has no stance here. I would explain to her she is a guest in your home and she should act as such.

If he's got a problem with that make sure he understands that you can remove him if he feels that way.", "NTA. It's not your job to tell her, it's your roommate's.

Sounds like it's time for her and Sam to go find their own place to live now.", "Tbh I wonder if it might be an option to set boundaries on how long/often guests can stay in your apartment being that you are the landlord. It kinda sounds as if she has semi moved in...seems really comfy?", "NTA.\n\nBut you don't know exactly how Sam relayed your message to Nina, so it's possible there was a miscommunication along the way and she's not just being dramatic. Had you spoken to Sam and Nina directly, you would know exactly what message she received: \"Hey guys, no big deal but I would really prefer we all wear pants in the common areas. Can we please make that a house rule going forward? Cool. Thanks!\" But you were indirect and it sounds like something was misunderstood between you, Sam, and Nina. Or maybe she asked Sam a follow up question and he tried to speculate as to your reasoning instead of you being there to answer yourself.\n\n\"He's sick of seeing your bum.\" Who knows?\n\nWhatever your reasoning, it was valid. Bootie germs on the couch, a more conservative upbringing, unexpected visits from Mom, respecting your belongings and space.

So, any perceived improprieties would be raised with Sam, the roommate, who pays you rent to live in your flat.", "NTA. I came in prepared to think something else from the title but you're right, you did not comment on her body. You just don't want someone's half bare ass on your furniture and there's nothing wrong with that. I think you may have been able to speak to her directly, but I also understand that it makes sense to speak to the person actually living there. I also get that you may have felt weird speaking to your roommates girlfriend about her clothes.", "Nta not her place. She should respect where she is and that another person is there. She can be upset and say what she wants but it doesn't change the fact that it's not her residence.", "\"I'm about to make a comment on your body and how I want it so bad to get out of my apartment.\"   \nNTA. Your apartment.", "NTA. You don't want her thighs sweating on your furniture. As long as you also don't let Sam sit shirtless leaning back on the same furniture, you are fully correct.

All of my friends are the same way as well and i\u2019ve never even heard of someone being uncomfortable by that. it\u2019ll make me think twice next time i decide to not throw pants on in the morning, but i guess i just don\u2019t look at things with a sexual lens. still more clothes than a bikini, and that\u2019s fine?", "I could never imagine girls wearing booty shorts at bars/school you\u2019re putting your bare ass on seats 100s of people sit on.

It sounds like you aren't comfortable with her wearing that little, and for the same reason, you were probably more comfortable speaking with your room mate. In addition, he's the one you are renting to.\n\nIt makes sense that she would feel uncomfortable, and that she might have preferred that you talk to her directly. It might also make her wonder why it made you uncomfortable. If you are super comfortable with platonic friends of all genders walking around in a T-shirt and underwear, it can be hard to put yourself in the headspace of someone who just isn't, especially when young.
