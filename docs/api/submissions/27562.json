It was gifted to me by parents and grandparents. It's a 2bedroom apartment so i started renting the other bedroom to earn some more extra cash. Then my flatmate Sam(m28) moved in 8 months ago. He is good guy and we get along fine. Recently his gf Nina(f30) have started spending alot of time at our apartment. I don't have any problem with that because Nina is pretty chill women and she always brings food/drinks for us. \n\nThe only problem is she is very free spirited like she wears really less clothes. Like she will walk around the living room or sits on our couch with nothing but robe/tshirt and underwear and I work from home so stay home majority of the time so I see her in underwear watching tv or playing games on tv in our living room. I am not attracted to her on anything but the thought of her half naked ass on our shared furniture is just doesn't sit right with me. So I told Sam about this and he said he'll have chat with Nina. \n\nThis morning Nina was at our apartment and she said I was out of the line with my comments on her body. First I was confused because I didn't make any comments on her body and then she said 'if I had any problem with her i should have said something to her face to face instead of going behind her back'. I said you don't live here so I told Sam about this instead of you and then we had small argument about 'i making comment on her body'.

It might also make her wonder why it made you uncomfortable.

Its not about her body, its about a persons lack of clothing on shared furniture and while others are around. Heck, even include that when you're out of the house you don't know, so its fine.
