Dad was listening in the whole time and heard me not mention my stepmom or stepsiblings during it but mentioning him and my mom and my brother (14m) and a couple of my really good friends. He heard me say how important all of them were to me and that I shined a spotlight on my mom being dead but still being important to me and how irreplaceable she was.\n\nI finished talking and dad confronted me over only considering \"some of my family\" the most important people in my life, and considering my brother more important than my stepsiblings. I told him it was how I felt. He said it made no sense though because we're all close. I said I like them okay but they're not on the same level as my brother for me.\n\nHe and I ended up in therapy for like 3 months and we had it out over that. Therapy ended at dad's request and we didn't go back.\n\nEver since he has been asking questions he does not want the answer to though. Like am I going to add the step relatives to my memory board that I keep in my room, did I want to spend time with my stepsiblings instead of keeping plans I had made with my friends. Then he started to ask if I love my stepmom/stepsiblings. Or don't I want to volunteer to do a big sibling thing at my stepsister's extra curricular instead of having her brother/my stepbrother do it. He didn't like my answers. Then he started bringing it up around the others. \n\nA couple of days ago during a family dinner he was like \"you love all your siblings equally, don't you?\" and my brother, stepmom and stepsiblings were there. It came up because two of my stepsiblings were saying they had done family trees in school and were all excited to talk about us and show what our family looks like. Then dad asked me what he did. I got angry and told him we needed to talk. He rolled his eyes at me and then my stepmom was like what was going on. Dad said I was acting weird about the question. I told him we should talk about it in private. My stepmom told me to just answer and move on. Dad was egging that on. I snapped at dad and told him he shouldn't ask questions he doesn't want a truthful answer to and that he needed to just leave me alone. I walked away from the table and apparently the exchange upset my stepsiblings. My brother said he was dodging questions from them and dad was seething.

Your dad is actively severing his chances at having a healthy relationship with you. (He clearly has his own shit to work through in individual therapy.) I doubt he even realizes that all of his behavior after hearing your presentation is actually the kind of stuff that would have kept him off your presentation list in the first place.\n\nI recommend researching the grey rock method, and employ that with your dad for the next few years until you\u2019re able to move out. \n\nYour dad is not only an AH \u2014 this is emotional manipulation veering on abuse.", "You could have answered, \u201cI only have one sibling.\u201d But that really wouldn\u2019t help.

Your dad is, in all honesty, trying to create emotions through force and intimidation. It is never going to work. You need to get there on your own, and if you don't get there, that is OK too.", "Your father is a massive asshole. He cannot just wish into reality what he would like. He is deliberately putting you on the spot then upset at your responses. If she read this sub a bit he might realise what a recipe for friction his impositions are.

Say \"No Dad, I do not, and everytime you bully me, every time you harass me, it builds resentment inside of me.  At this point I don't know if I will ever be able to embrace them as family, but I do know if you keep pushing and bullying me, it will poison the well so deeply that there will never be a chance of it.  Is that what you wanted to hear?  Did you decide you didn't just want to hurt and bully me, but also hurt and bully your step kids and wife?  How much pain do you want to cause over this, because you are causing a lot?\"", "NTA\n\nYour Dad is completely out of line.

If he wants you to say that you love them or whatever, you can just say it to keep the peace.  You don't have to mean it.  I doubt he really cares if you mean it or not.  If he wants you to do something with them, you can just say you're busy rather than going into the whole argument again.  You can be honest once you're legally and financially independent from him.", "NTA. The fact that your father has been asking you those questions in front of your step-siblings and stepmom just shows that he\u2019s picking a fight\u2026 and for your stepmother I feel like she was out off line with the \u201cu should just answer and move on\u201d how do u answer a question like that one\u2026 anyway good luck living in thar household until u can move out", "NTA. He needs to respect that just because he married a new woman that doesn't mean she and her kids are your family. He sounds like one of those parents that wants to live in a fantasy world where broken families can get glued back together the way everything was before. They don't want to deal with the emotional fallout it caused their kids. They don't want to face the reality that their choices have caused pain to their kids. You loving your real family most shatters his fantasy and he can't handle it. Don't let him manipulate you into pretending everything is okay when it's not just to make him feel more comfortable.", "NTA.\n\nKudos to you for showing more maturity and sensitivity than your father did at that table, OP.\n\nYou didn't want to hurt the steps' feelings but your dad figured he'd either force you to lie to appease his sense of family or make you the villain. You wisely sidestepped his trap.\n\nAnd you were respectful to him, to boot.\n\nYour father is an AH. He can't MAKE you feel anything about anyone. He likely ended the therapy because your therapist told him this. The best he can expect is that you tolerate them and treat them civilly. It sounds like you do.\n\nLet him know again in private that your feelings are your feelings and it doesn't serve anyone for him to try to make you hurt them. And that is what he's actively going to do. Also let him know that this is emotional manipulation that he shouldn't engage in. That one day you'll be of age and out from under his roof. Remind him that feelings change based on the experiences you have with people and that one day he may find that his pushing and forcefulness may make you not want to have a relationship with him in the future either.", "Asking you that question in front of your step-siblings was manipulative as all get out, and the fallout is 100% on him.

That's a shame but you can't change his behavior, just continue to act with that grace and maturity you've already shown.

NTA all the way!\n\nYour dad be like \"how dare you feel the way you feel, you should feel the way I want you to feel\". Fun fact about feelings: it's on of the few things we have absolutely no control over. \n\nPlus, they are not your siblings. They are stepsiblings. Sometimes we can end up feeling like stepsiblings are siblings, but noone can enforce that! And forcing that when you lost your mom... no wonder your bond to your brother, blood related to your mother! When dealing with such a loss at such a young age you tend to retract from the world\n\nYour dad is being super toxic. I think he saw therapy won't lead to things going his way, because therapy is about getting to understand where the other is coming from. So he cancelled sonhe may still have it his way.\n\nYou might never love your stepsiblings the way you love your brother. But from someone that has many siblings and stepsiblings, you love everyone in your own way, and you may end up loving them as siblings, just siblings that are from another generation so you don't really relate to them.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. If your stepmom is a rational adult (but if she is with you dad still, maybe not) you could address it with her, tell her that it's not against them at all, eventhough your dad likes to think that it is. You just feel that your bond to your mbrother or your mother isn't the same as the one with them. I'm sure she doesn't have the same bond with you as she has to her bio kids.\n\nYou should check out r/raisedbynarcissists cause your father can't seem to accept that not everything has to be about him and his family (which to narcissists is supposed to be an extension of themselves)", "Sounds like dad fucked around and found out to me.", "I think a NAH here... I'm assuming your dad was a widower who got remarried.\n\nI think he's having some unrealistic expectations of a happy blended family, but that doesn't make him an AH. And you don't have that relationship with your step family, that doesn't make you an AH. More therapy might be necessary to express to him that there's just a difference between someone you've known your whole life (or their whole life) and someone who 2 parents put together because they got married. \n\nBut also, cut your dad some slack. I think he's trying to make sure there's no weird family rivalries, and just failing.", "NTA, your dad is a jackass.

Lots of step siblings don't get a long at all.  I'm guessing your steb siblings are younger than you and what he is doing is cruel because they won't understand your feelings about them.", "I would be very careful with using the grey rock method as it back backfire.

Therapy isn't about forcing someone to agree with you, it's about trying to see things from the other person's perspective and coming to a better understanding. Feelings are organic. You don't make them up and they don't come out of no where. You can't control the way you feel, only the way to react to those feelings. If you were being mean to your stepfamily, that would be one thing. But it sounds like your dad is just upset you aren't overflowing with love for them. What he fails to realize is that's not something you can force. You either feel it or you don't. It doesn't sound like you're saying you hate your stepfamily or are treating them badly, so your dad would do well to just leave you alone and not push this. If he doesn't, I would say to him, \"I love you. I love my siblings. I like my stepfamily and care about them. But I can't force myself to love them the way you want me to so you need to stop pushing me.

Adds the niceties that gray doesn't. Softens the edges, but still doesn't engage and protects OP", "That's what the therapist tried to tell him. But I think he wanted to believe it had to be love I feel for them. That I need to have them at the same level of priority in my life. Less than that is not what my dad is okay with accepting.", "And it sounds like that's what the therapist said and Dad didn't like that so he decided they should stop going. That's also a massive indication that Dad is the AH. By trying to force OP into feeling something he doesn't feel Dad is only pushing him away. OP should let Dad know that if he keeps pushing this he will sever whatever ties are left as soon as he leaves home.", "Ah I see. It sounds like he didn't go to therapy with an open mind and was expecting the therapist to agree with him. It's a tough situation. At the end of the day, you can't help what you feel, whether he accepts that or not is his problem that he is going to have to deal with", "Have you tried talking to stepmom about the issue. You don't hate them,  but if he keeps pushing you you're going to end up saying things that are going to affect the younger kids, and I'm sure she doesn't want that.", "THIS!   When asked to work on himself and HIS unrealistic expectations.. your dad stopped therapy, which he desperately needs.   \n\nYou are NTA OP.  You were given a choice between lying and telling the truth       You are acting more like an adult than your father right now"]}
