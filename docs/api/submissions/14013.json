{"id": 14013, "submission_id": "12bys08", "title": "AITA for not inviting my friend\u2019s son to my son\u2019s sleepover due to him being autistic?", "selftext": "I (F38) am a single mom and have a son (M5 who I\u2019ll call Max) who is having a sleepover with all the kids his age from church. I sent the invites via email to all the parents in the fellowship group except for the parents of a boy who\u2019s autistic (we\u2019ll call him Bobby). \n\nOur fellowship group is comprised of parents of 7 boys who are all 5 or 6 years old. This is going to be the first sleepover the boys have, the other hang out events have been during the day. At these events which are usually just the boys having fun in someone\u2019s back yard, Bobby yells and screams and cries. I know these are symptoms of autism, and I\u2019m worried about how he would be at a sleepover without his parents there. \n\nThere was only one other time Bobby was around the other boys without his parents there. He ended up tearing up the person\u2019s house and breaking a lot of glass. There was also an incident with him and Max that resulted in me having to take Max to the ER.\n\nAnyway, Bobby\u2019s mom heard about the sleepover from one of the other parents. She\u2019s very upset with me because Bobby was looking forward to this sleepover; all the boys were. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable being the only parent with 6 boys plus a boy who needs extra attention, and who I physically don\u2019t know how to take care of. \n\nBobby\u2019s mom told me I would be fine and that I have to invite her son or not host a sleepover at all. I felt that neither of those were options, because Max wanted his gift for finishing kindergarten to be his first sleepover with his church friends. Also, I know I cannot take care of Bobby for a whole night because he needs accommodations that I am unable to accommodate. I don\u2019t have a separate room that Bobby would be able to sleep in, we only have one bathroom and Bobby is incapable of waiting for somebody else to finish before he can go. And I\u2019m also not equipped to help Bobby in case of a panic attack. \n\nBobby\u2019s mom is calling all of these reasons \u201cdiscriminatory excuses\u201d. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but I do sympathize for Bobby\u2019s parents because I know situations like this aren\u2019t easy. \n\nThe sleepover is set in stone, and it will happen. Bobby still is not invited, and it\u2019s this Friday to Saturday. The boys will be coming over after our church\u2019s Good Friday service.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1680646845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bys08/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friends_son_to_my_sons/", "score": 324, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like Bobby isnt fit for sleepovers. I think Bobby's mom just wants a night off.", "NTA. Your concerns are valid and you\u2019re looking out for the wellbeing of yourself and the other kids as well as Bobby by recognising and voicing your limitations. Imagine what might happen if something were to happen with Bobby and his parents weren\u2019t around to help with the situation. I can understand the parents wanting Bobby included in things, but they do need to understand that they can\u2019t force other people to do something", "*There was only one other time Bobby was around the other boys without his parents there.

There was also an incident with him and Max that resulted in me having to take Max to the ER.*\n\nNTA given that specific context. You would be TA if the lack of an invite was just because he was autistic, but you have evidence for how he needs extra care that you are unable to provide.\n\nThat being said, I can see why the mom is ticked, especially if her son was excited for the sleepover and he ended up being the ONLY one not invited in his social group. It probably hurts her deeply to know that her son will be excluded from things for reasons beyond his control. That\u2019s not your fault, and she needs to be understanding that you have legitimate reasons, but I can sympathize.", "NTA\n\nYou cannot accommodate and make sure this boy is safe. It does stink for him but it\u2019s something his parents must accept, that their child needs extra support and may not always be able to do everything other kids can. \n\nThey can\u2019t expect everyone to be able to handle their child and have accommodations to make sure he\u2019s safe. You\u2019re not a business or workplace, you\u2019re a regular person.", "NTA. Bobby tore up someone's house, and hurt your son so badly you had to take him to the ER. You're already going to have 6 boys to corral. While I understand Bobby's mom being upset, she is being completely unrealistic expecting you to include him when you have no experience, and knowing he's broken things and hurt your son.", "NTA \n\nYou are not excluding bobby because of his autism, you are worried about safety. If he is known to break things and hurt others, it is not safe for anyone to leave him without his parents or other people capable of taking care of him. \n\nI am autistic myself and i remember it being very difficult to be without my parents at that age. In my opinion you are doing the correct choice, despite what bobbys mom is thinking.", "NTA. It\u2019s your house and you\u2019re uncomfortable. I work with kids on the spectrum and they can be a handful, even with training in behavioral therapy. I feel bad for the kid, absolutely\u2026kids on the spectrum are consistently left out of peer activities. But his mom needs to understand and parent accordingly.", "NTA. It really is unfortunate that he's being excluded, but this is a legitimate safety issue. I saw in one of your comments that Bobby has smashed your son's hand with a rock and sent him to the ER over a cupcake. \nIf your son wants to include him in some way, maybe you can invite him and his mother over for the first part of the evening, to watch a movie or something. But it sounds like there isn't any way to have him sleep over without likely dealing with meltdowns, bathroom accidents, and possibly violence, and you'd still have to keep an eye on all the other kids too. It's too much of her to ask, and she had no right to order you around like that anyway.", "NTA. She has a lot of nerve telling you that you \"have to invite him or not have a sleepover at all.\" You don't *have to* set your social invitations to her specifications, even if you would've been the AH for not doing it... and you aren't; your reasons are sound. \n\nI would hope she wouldn't want her child in the care of a parent who says explicitly that they cannot give him what he needs.", "Nta. I get why mum is upset, but even if he wasn't autistic, you don't have to invite anyone to your house and you don't need to explain why.", "NTA.  Bobby's mom needs to accept the reality of her situation and get her son help.  The idea that you have to choose between getting your home trashed, or not having a sleepover, is absurd.  Not to mention this kid put your son in the hospital previously.  No.  You are not required to include him.", "NTA\n\nIt is great to be inclusive, but you have clear evidence (hospital trip) that you cannot handle Bobby. It would be irresponsible for you to invite him. \n\nGood luck with taking care of six 5 yr old boys on your own for a night!!! That's sure to be an interesting time all on its own!", "NTA unless you give in to pressure. I wouldn\u2019t let a kid who deliberately injured my child and also destroyed property (glass!) into my house ever!  It sucks that he has problems.  It sucks for the mother.  Max should not have someone over he is not 100% comfortable with.  Bobby\u2019s feelings are irrelevant to the situation.  Bobby\u2019s mother will always push for more.  You don\u2019t have to feel sorry or do anything.  If she complains to others, tell them they can have a sleepover at their place.", "NTA.\n\nI really feel for Bobby and his mom.  It must feel horrible to be left out of things, especially stuff like this when he is the only one being excluded. I get why his mom is so upset.\n\nBut...\n\nThis isn't just a matter of \"oh, he is difficult, let me exclude him\".  You have very real and legitimate concerns. You don't have the space in your home (separate room and second bathroom) to accommodate his needs, and the last time he was without his parents resulted in him tearing up a home and doing something where your son wound up in the ER. Based on that, him staying over without one of his parents sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA. Bobby\u2019s mom is unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to take care of a special needs kid. If he can\u2019t be without proper supervision then he shouldn\u2019t be there.", "NTA. While the other mom does have a point in terms of inclusivity, the mother is trying to bully you into doing something that you aren\u2019t equipped to do \u2026 and she\u2019s not realistic. Next time, if you really want to, I would ask to have coffee with the mom and say something like \u201clisten, I really think it\u2019s important to involve your son in my sons birthday celebration, but I given the experiences I\u2019ve had with your son, I don\u2019t have the capacity to let him sleepover with the other boys. That said, I\u2019m wondering if maybe he could come for the first part with cake - and you there to help supervise?\u201d See how that goes over. If the mom isn\u2019t receptive or understanding, she\u2019s crazy. But I do think you should have said something to her directly before sending invites to all the other kids and having her find out second hand", "NTA I bad for Bobby and his mother. But she can't be serious when she tells you \"oh you'll be fine\". Really? He's already known for tearing up other people's houses. I know Bobby's mom is trying to be fair to her son but you also got to think about your son, his guests and your home.", "NTA. \n\nYou are making the safest, happiest choice for your son, whose birthday and celebration this is, and who deserves to enjoy himself in safety and without the potential for drama, injury and possible ER trips. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that you have compassion for Bobby and his parents, but the practicalities and logistics of this are beyond your resources and that is okay.  It is a better and more responsible choice to say that than to put children and yourself at risk in order to provide a therapeutic social experience for a child whose parents are maybe unable to recognize that he\u2019s not entirely ready for a socially intense experience in an environment not designed for his support needs. \n\nI have niblings who are neurodiverse and the whole family (there are a lot of us) works really hard to both accommodate them and to help them learn that unless and until they can manage themselves appropriately in stressful social environments, they will miss out on some stuff - not because anyone is bad, but because everyone has needs, and their needs are not always going to be the priorities.", "NTA you didn\u2019t exclude him because of his diagnosis or disability.\nYou excluded him because you can\u2019t manage his behaviour and keep everyone safe.", "NTA BUUUUUUTTTTTT I know where Bobby\u2019s mom is coming from. She hasn\u2019t accepted the reality her son is in need of special care. She doesn\u2019t want him to be excluded and she wants him to have as normal a life as is humanly possible. I get her vociferous defense of her child. \n\nIt is NOT your responsibility to provide these things. Maybe another trial sleepover when it can be just Max and Bobby, where the accommodations are more reasonable?", "NTA\n\nBobby clearly isn\u2019t safe. You had to take your son to the ER!!\n\nSounds like Bobby\u2019s mom wants a night off.\n\nDon\u2019t cow tow to her. Stand your ground.", "NTA\nI mean I suppose Bobby and his mom could come over together for some period of time during the sleepover and then he could go home for the evening, but even that kind of ruins the concept of first sleep away for the kids.", "NTA. You are being very kind and thoughtful by having the foresight and honesty to be able to say that you just don\u2019t know how to care for an autistic child.", "NTA. I think what is most important is to keep the well-being of all the kids in focus. If Bobby has special needs that doesn't mean he has to be excluded in general. This hurts a lot of special need people, especially children, who cannot understand why they are treated differently. It could be that his mom is upset, because she doesn't want him to feel left out. However, if you don't feel able to meet Bobby's needs it is important to act accordingly in order to avoid possible risks for him (and the other kids). And I'm not necessarily talking about things like getting hurt, but also about possible emotional damage from possible outbursts or such. If kids this age get too tired they can feel a lot more stressed than usually and it's not foreseeable if they treat Bobby differently under a more stressful situation than usually. (Thinking about kids rarely sleeping when they should during sleepovers, some missing home unexpectedly and so on.)\nYour argumentation sounds valid and thought through. The only thing I can think of to make things better next time would be to tell Bobby's mom in advance if he's not included next time so she can prepare him for a negative situation. I'm pretty sure he would still be upset to get excluded, but maybe the blow wouldn't be as hard, if he wouldn't be all hyped up about he idea to be included from the beginning.\nWhat I couldn't help to think about was the following: could you find a compromise like letting Bobby's mom sleep over, too? If she would she could (knowing him best) tend to his needs, if needed and you wouldn't have to master the situation alone. \n\nIn general and from my pedagogical point of view as a social worker, you're NTA. This is a very complicated situation to begin with, which is set up to create a disappointment/stress for people. And yet I do think you are acting on what you can trust yourself with and that's important in dealing with children.", "NTA-Bobby needs more help than you can give. If his mom wasn\u2019t so entitled I would say have Bobby over for games or something before the sleepover, but considering that Bobby hurt your son, your obligation is to make sure your child is happy and safe. Bobby\u2019s mom needs to be a better parent.", "Bobby's mom doesn't get to dictate what you get to do for your own son. I don't hear that she is volunteering to do anything to make this work. Saying that if he's not invited, it has to be canceled, which is ridiculous. Kinda makes me wonder if he is truly autistic or a victim of bad parenting.", "NTA. Autistic or not, there is no way in hell I would ever have a child around that is notorious for destroying houses AND already sent my child to the ER. Honestly, it's not your problem to make her kid happy. It is your job to keep YOUR kid safe.", "NTA not all kids that age, in general, can handle sleepovers. Her kid is clearly not ready. You should also not be responsible for a child you don\u2019t feel equipped to care for. \n\nBefore anyone comes at me, I have an autistic kid who is 11 and still not ready for sleepovers without his brothers also being there. Kid hates sleeping anywhere but his own bed. I get the desire to give your kid equal experiences but some things can\u2019t be rushed.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Everything else aside, such as him unable to hold it and wait for the bathroom, destroying things, the yelling/screaming/crying, and all that, he hurt your child to the point your child needed an ER visit. That should have warranted a sit down conversation between the church leaders and that boy\u2019s parents. He has harmed your son when his parents and other parents were around to watch their kids and the others to make sure everything was okay, you will be alone with several other boys trying to keep an eye on everyone. His history of violence mixed with you having so many young kids around makes for a potentially very dangerous situation.", "NTA But i think you should've told her beforehand maybe to find a way for Bobby to go to the sleepover, maybe he could just go to the sleepover as a regular party, go play with the other kids and maybe even invite his mom to be with you during the party just in case something goes wrong, and if he is feeling uncomfortable his mom could just take him home to sleep and bring him back the next morning to eat breakfast with the other kids or something like that", "this is an a hole but not the a hole situation \n\nyou needed to have the conversation with bobby\u2019s mom in advance, not after the invites had all gone out because it\u2019s very easy to anticipate that a single child excluded from an otherwise whole-group activity will feel terrible. there may have been a way to include him for some but not all of the event, or at least smooth over any potential hard feelings. she\u2019s not wrong that you have treated her child badly.\n\nthat said, the law (which does not apply here, but provides a useful guideline) is that employers and private schools need to try to make reasonable accommodations that wouldn\u2019t otherwise totally alter the workplace or program. in you case your home is not physically equipped to accommodate his needs and it would not be reasonably possible for you to alter it in a way that would make it suitable. and ultimately i think that\u2019s the deciding factor.\n\nnah", "Gentle ESH because you should have had this conversation beforehand. Your reasoning, I think, is solid especially considering the ER trip, but excluding one child for any reason requires a conversation. I get that you cannot accommodate, but this couldn\u2019t have felt good for them.", "Real active Reddit here. Anyways, I think you need to explain to her that you can\u2019t just accommodate everything around Bobby. Not is is that unfair, super unrealistic. HOWEVER, it is very insulting to invite everyone else except for one person because of a supposed prejudice (people think you\u2019re intolerant). Even though you might not exactly be intolerant, your actions do promote intolerance. So either make the group more private, or accommodate for Bobby with help from someone. If Bobby\u2019s mother really feels you\u2019re being intolerant, give her the dilemma of helping or not bringing Bobby at all", "YTA a bit because you excluded 1 child from the group (for valid reasons) and didn\u2019t approach his mum in the first instance to explain your thinking, this could have resulted in a compromise I.e. Bobby attends for the evening but not overnight with a parent accompanying, or it would have given mum the opportunity to create plans or at least try minimise her sons expectations.\n\nYou\u2019re not totally an AH because it would seem that Bobby has high needs and you recognise that your home is not equipped to accommodate  and that you can\u2019t just develop the skill set required to support him for the purpose of the sleepover. \n\nYou don\u2019t make any reference to your child actually being friends with Bobby and although it\u2019s important to not discriminate, if there\u2019s previously been a violent incident with your child it would also be understandable if he did not want Bobby to attend.", "NTA with a hint of ESH because you didn't give them much chance to help before just denying the invitation. \n\n There is/was a possibility of having a conversation with the mom before hand and specifying how she can make it possible: like extra care or someone to chaperone and provide care while being out of sight or in the adult spaces in the home. They would basically have to be a fly on the wall and stay up all night to prevent issues. If there is crying or screaming or tantrums, their goal is to calm things down.\n\nIt's a struggle, but depending on the child he would need to get help adapting or help with understanding why he can't do everything the same. It's just like any other developmental concern, not everyone develops the same. \n\nIf his health or the other children's health OR your home condition is at risk because of a child's behavior it's within reason to limit those who cause issues from attending. Unfortunately since he has autism his PARENTS (not you) need to go the extra mile to accommodate his needs and make the situation safe. This would mean a discussion prior to inviting anyone. \n\nIf he comes over and gets over-stimulated and runs through a glass window or pulls over your TV, that's not your fault but you could get sued and he could end up in the hospital. \n\nHis parents could provide you with tools to make it possible to be safe, but that's not your job. You could limit where the kids can go and child-proof those areas, but you still have to be careful.  He could also go home late and avoid being there all night, and return for breakfast. There are options, maybe give the parents a call and explain that you didn't know how to handle the situation so you avoided it (and say sorry).\n\nGood luck!", "NAH or ESH. Obviously just my opinion but there is no \u201cright way\u201d to handle this. \n\nPersonally, I think this could\u2019ve been avoided if you told him to just pick 2 friends that could sleepover. Inviting all but one child is absolutely going to upset the child and/or parent. Plus, these kids are on the young side for a sleepover anyway and that many boys is a lot to handle.", "You couldn\u2019t suggest he come for a while and leave before sleep time?", "YTA for not being open about his exclusion from the event. It\u2019s perfectly valid to say you are not equipped to handle a special needs child and to tell his mom that, but you should have been upfront about it. You knew she was going to find out, so avoiding the conversation just exacerbated the bad feelings. \n\nIt sounds like the mom is in denial about the amount of support her son needs and the feasibility and comfort level of other parents who are not specifically trained to deal with SN to take responsibility for her son. As a group you may need to have a discussion with her about this to establish some expectations going forward.", "Nooooo! You really didn't did you? YTA. \n\nListen, your son is 5 so I'll give you a new parent pass but you really really can't invite an entire class/Sunday school group/boy scout troop and exclude just one or two kids. You can invite just a few kids but anytime you obviously shun one kid you've done a rotten thing. In this case your power move would have been to approach this boys mom in person and asked her if she would be free to come to a birthday celebration with her son. You can explain that you can't supervise the entire crew alone but that you'd like a way for her son to participate.", "ESH\n\nHis parents need to do something to help their child be able to interact without them.\n\nYou're an ass for saying you're not inviting someone because they have autism, when the truth is they have behavioral issues due to their accommodation needs not being met. \n\nBut yes, you all suck for not figuring this out. You're excluding a child because he has needs the other kids don't. \n\nAnd instead of you all facing this head on and figuring out, you thought excluding him from the jump was the OK thing to do. No conversation with his parents, no searching for solutions, just right to exclusion...", "ESH because you don\u2019t invite ALL the kids (except one)in a group. That\u2019s pretty cold. Sometimes this means you don\u2019t have class or group parties. Is it fair?

I sent the invites via email to all the parents in the fellowship group except for the parents of a boy who\u2019s autistic (we\u2019ll call him Bobby). \n\nOur fellowship group is comprised of parents of 7 boys who are all 5 or 6 years old. This is going to be the first sleepover the boys have, the other hang out events have been during the day. At these events which are usually just the boys having fun in someone\u2019s back yard, Bobby yells and screams and cries. I know these are symptoms of autism, and I\u2019m worried about how he would be at a sleepover without his parents there. \n\nThere was only one other time Bobby was around the other boys without his parents there. He ended up tearing up the person\u2019s house and breaking a lot of glass. There was also an incident with him and Max that resulted in me having to take Max to the ER.\n\nAnyway, Bobby\u2019s mom heard about the sleepover from one of the other parents. She\u2019s very upset with me because Bobby was looking forward to this sleepover; all the boys were. I told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable being the only parent with 6 boys plus a boy who needs extra attention, and who I physically don\u2019t know how to take care of. \n\nBobby\u2019s mom told me I would be fine and that I have to invite her son or not host a sleepover at all. I felt that neither of those were options, because Max wanted his gift for finishing kindergarten to be his first sleepover with his church friends. Also, I know I cannot take care of Bobby for a whole night because he needs accommodations that I am unable to accommodate. I don\u2019t have a separate room that Bobby would be able to sleep in, we only have one bathroom and Bobby is incapable of waiting for somebody else to finish before he can go. And I\u2019m also not equipped to help Bobby in case of a panic attack. \n\nBobby\u2019s mom is calling all of these reasons \u201cdiscriminatory excuses\u201d. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong, but I do sympathize for Bobby\u2019s parents because I know situations like this aren\u2019t easy. \n\nThe sleepover is set in stone, and it will happen. Bobby still is not invited, and it\u2019s this Friday to Saturday. The boys will be coming over after our church\u2019s Good Friday service.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know how difficult it was for that mother to see her child excluded. We tried to use it as a teaching moment.

When I was maybe 7 I had a birthday party at the zoo with my whole class invited and my dad literally spent the whole time holding this kids hand, to avoid a tantrum. It's probably not ideal that he wasn't really given a chance to socialise normally, but at least he got to enjoy the zoo a bit and wasn't completely excluded. I can't say for sure but I'd say he was probably excluded from other parties, and I can only imagine how hurtful it would have been.

A week or so later, because the kid's parents raised such hell, the principal reviewed the footage. The kid who got bit was shown pulling my friend's son's hair over and over, pinching him in the back, and kicking the back of his heels trying to trip him. As the boy was yanking on his hair, my friend's son turned around and bit his extended forearm. As a 5 year old, the child with autism didn't have the words/ability to communicate to ask the child to stop pulling his hair and kicking his heels, so he stopped him the only way he know how. Unfortunate situation for all involved. But, I do know from experience that kids with autism and/or communication deficits can engage in physically aggressive behavior because at times, that is their only means of effective communication. Not saying that's the case here, but a lot of folks posted that Bobby was maliciously and intentionally hurting Max.

I was going to suggest he could even get in his jammies and then leave later but that might cause. For next time or maybe for the mom of \"Bobby\" maybe suggest this idea I heard on the radio. Mom was petrified of having multiple kids in her house over night so did a sleepover day they cam in Jammies did all the normal stuff went home at about 8.30/9pm", "NTA.\n\nBobby's parents should understand that you are unable to care for their child, who needs extra special attention. Yes it not a nice feeling to be excluded, but they should not demand that you cancel the sleepover. Maybe you could have explained to her beforehand why you would not be inviting her son, not sure if that would have made a difference.", "NTA. It's a safety issue.", "NTA. It is sad that some kids with autism are too volatile/violent/unpredictable/unsafe to do all the same things children their age without autism can/are expected to do. But that is the reality for some kids. You cannot be expected to be a special ed therapist or teacher or resource aide EVER, let alone when you are hosting your own kid\u2019s birthday party with a sleepover. It\u2019s ridiculous for Bobby\u2019s mom to be angry with you, demand that you invite Bobby, and demand that you somehow take care of her special needs child who is volatile, incapable of emotion regulation for his age, and sometimes violent.", "NTA Bobby\u2019s mom need to open her eyes and use some common sense. You can\u2019t make people accommodate your child under any circumstance when they can\u2019t handle the behavior or destructive behaviors. \u201cDiscriminatory excuses\u201d is just another way of her getting her way and getting a break from her sons behavior at the expense of others. My nephew has Autism (he was raised by my mom and I) and if we know he can\u2019t handle certain situations we don\u2019t send him and we don\u2019t press others to deal with his melt downs. Every situation isn\u2019t going to inclusive  her this friends son she needs to stop pushing or she won\u2019t have any friends that want to be bothered with her and it will effect her sons social skills and being invited to any kind of events at all.", "NTA. You know what your limitations are and what you are capable of handling. You're not discriminating against him.", "Saying this as someone who is on the spectrum, NTA. It's clear that Bobby is a danger to your son and, even if they are friends, you don't want to potentially be liable for any injuries Bobby causes while at your house at a sleepover.", "NTA. Bobby\u2019s mom is not your \u201cfriend. Friends do not guilt-trip & billy to get their way. In addition to autism, Bobby has a poor role model.", "It is hard when your child has special needs and isn\u2019t/can\u2019t be treated like other kids. However, demanding he be included is rude. No one is owed a invite to a party, especially when the child has specific requirements that simply can\u2019t be met. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf the sleepover is important to Bobby, she should volunteer to stay at your house to help. I understand she wants a night off, but she needs to choose which is more important. Allowing Bobby to be included or being child free for a few hours. If it\u2019s about Bobby, she needs to choose Bobby.

You are actually not inviting bobby for the right reasons (feeling you are not prepared to take care of him is valid) this isn\u2019t discriminatory at all and this is coming from someone who has a family member with autism as we would never let him go to sleep over because we know how he is.", "NTA, Bobby can look forward to things all he wants but until he is capable of doing them it would be a disservice to everyone to have him take part.  You cannot accommodate him and attempting to would put you, and all the children, at risk.  Why should all the other children miss out because Bobby is unable to safely and comfortably participate?", "NTA. I have two autistic children. One of them is never let him do a sleepover because he could have meltdown, hurt himself/others, etc. this mom is being unreasonable expecting people to handle her child like she can. I don\u2019t even leave my child with most family. She should understand not everyone can handle meltdowns, aggression, etc. she\u2019s probably just upset, and grieving her child doesn\u2019t have a life like so called normal kids. We all feel that, but she has no right to project that on you. If a child sent mine to the er I\u2019d never let that kid come over!", "7 boys by yourself is a lot. NTA.  You could ask Max's mom to co host. It would still be a sleepover, and you would have an extra person.", "If he's yelling and screaming the whole time, he's overwhelmed and not having a good time anyway.", "Sounds like Bobby\u2019s mom is looking for a night off by foisting her responsibilities onto someone else.", "Bobby\u2019s mom also needs to realize that it\u2019s his behavior that\u2019s preventing him from being invited to social gatherings. It sounds like a lot of people within this group have attempted to include Bobby outside of church, and none of these have ended well whether or not his mom was present. Unfortunately, I think she needs to take a step back and be realistic. These issues need to be addressed head on- he needs coping strategies and help. There will always, always be things outside of his control, and it\u2019s in his best interest for the adults in his life to ensure that they\u2019re providing strategies and support to ensure success in as many areas as possible. \n\nBobby\u2019s mom is allowed to be sad about the fact that his life will look different from everyone else\u2019s. She also needs to accept that there will be limitations, and not everyone is equipped to safely handle and support her child\u2019s needs nor is she entitled to demand that they do so. Instead of taking her frustrations out on other parents, she needs look other places for solutions (eg: behavioral/occupational therapy, support groups for parents, etc.). \n\nIt\u2019s also extremely important that she appreciates the danger inherent in some of his behavior. Without her supervision, he managed to trash someone else\u2019s home and break glass everywhere. That should have been a HUGE wake up call- his coping mechanisms are maladaptive and pose a safety risk to himself and others. Then he sent OP\u2019s son to the ER\u2026.And she is angry that her kid isn\u2019t invited to that same child\u2019s sleepover?!? That I truly don\u2019t understand despite being on the spectrum myself. NTA, OP. You are being realistic about the situation and your capabilities. A diagnosis is not an excuse, and you need to ensure the safety of your son.", "Bobby sent OP's kid to the ER after intentionally injuring him.

Her son's safety matters more than than being \"jesus like.\"", ">so she wasn't blindsided.\n\nyeah, of course she'd still expect an invite after her son sent OP's to the hospital. it's plain rude to treat them like they aren't still bosom buddies after that. /s", "OP said that Bobby\u2019s mom is the type of person who would say \u201cjust for a few hours\u201d & leave him there with no contact and not pick him up until the morning", "You guys need to sit down with Bobby\u2019s parents and talk about his needs and how and when they can be accommodated. Even one of Bobby\u2019s parents would struggle to handle him and six other boys in a very stimulating environment on their own, because you have to be willing and ready to remove them when they reach a meltdown stage. You should talk about how many and which adults should be present, how to recognize his stress, and techniques to help him. The last thing you want to do is blindside them last minute. Autistic kids require a lot of preparation to manage impending schedule changes. If he found out the day of that he wasn\u2019t going, the odds are strong that he would have a full meltdown over it. At this stage, there is a chance that Bobby\u2019s behaviors will make him even more different from his peers as they mature. It would really be in his best interest for him to have a good group of friends who accept him for who he is.", "Bobby sending OP's kid to the ER is more than just a minor behavioral problem. Your situation is not the same as everyone's, and OP is in no way equipped to handle Bobby from their own comments.", "Yeah this isn\u2019t about autism anymore, this about behaviours that endanger the other kids.", "That\u2019s what tipped the scales for me.", "No parent in their right mind will even want to host a kid who sent their own kid to the ER. That ship has sailed for this kid and OP's family.", "Never said OP should be equipped to handle Bobby. A conversation could have been had with Bobby's parents prior to initiating invites to either find a solution where Bobby's parent could attend with him for a short time and handle all the Bobby issues that would arise, or at the very minimum let the parents know the issues to mitigate some of the hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, I'm an ER nurse. Just because you take your kid to the ER doesnt mean they have an injury that warrants it. Rock to the hand was probably a scratch or an abrasion, which can be handled at home unless the child wasn't tetanus vaccinated. I have had parents bring their  kids to the ER that have eyelashes in their eye (no joke), or because their kid hasnt pooped in 3 days, and TONS of minor injuries or all out stupid situations that should have gotten an outpatient assessment, or didn't need any medical assessment at all. ER is for life-threatening injuries, so it's really not fair to say that Bobby sent Max to the ER, because he didn't have life-threatening injuries.", "She sounds like a gem /s\n\nNTA"]}
