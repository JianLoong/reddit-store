{"id": 23051, "submission_id": "158mubv", "title": "AITA for taking away my daughter's Eras Tour tickets?", "selftext": "So I, (42f) have 2 daughters Ruby (17f), and Penelope (14f). This story will be about Ruby. Ruby has been pretty well-behaved most of her life, but for a few months now, she has been going through what I'm guessing to be her 'rebellious phase'. One thing that hasn't changed however, is that she is still a huge 'Swiftie'. \n\nMy husband and I got Ruby 2 Eras Tour tickets for her 17th birthday. We told her that she could bring whoever she wanted with the other ticket. Recently however, she has gotten into some very serious trouble. \n\nEarlier this month, I allowed Ruby to use my car. She crashed it into a fire hydrant while drunk.   She got her license suspended and had to pay a fine. I grounded her for the rest of the summer, but still allowed her to go to the concert. But two weeks later she snuck out to go to a party, and got arrested for underaged drinking. \n\nAt this point, I've had about enough, and took away her concert tickets. She didn't seem like she cared that much and I'm guessing it's because she thought I would just give them back the day of the concert or something. Well I didn't, I thought it would be better to just sell them, she's already seen her perform before during her Reputation Tour and a few other shows. \n\nThe day of the concert, Ruby and her best friend were getting ready for the concert in her room. When they were done, Ruby came out and asked for the tickets. I told her no, that I already told her she wasn't going. Ruby looked absolutely horrified and expressed that she thought I was joking, she said that her and her friend already got ready and everything. I just told her no, she has to learn the consequences of her actions, she was lucky she didn't go to jail! Ruby started crying and went back into her room where her friend was. \n\nNow, the day after the concert Ruby isn't talking to me and I honestly feel a little bad. I know she's been looking forward to the concert for weeks. My parents have also told me it was a little harsh.

It's the lack of taught responsibility and risk awareness that's bothering me here.", "ESH\n\nMostly because what you did was taking away something you previously gifted which is illegal (at least the book I read in one of the business law courses I took said so also probably depends on where you live) so you are punishing your daughter for doing something illegal by doing something illegal.

I mean I probably would\u2019ve not left my room for at least 24 hours.

It was the first time she was caught.  Statistically, this is almost 100% guaranteed.  There is likely a chance (about 40%) that alcohol wasn\u2019t the only substance.  Once there is a positive test result for alcohol, all testing stops because a positive for alcohol guarantees a conviction and almost every jurisdiction will stop testing at this point.   Have you and your daughter made a plan for how she is going to get home safely the next time alcohol or another substance is involved?  You will be the AH if you don\u2019t make a plan with her because this WILL happen again, as she\u2019s proved so to you already.  Has she had a substance use disorder evaluation?  You will also be the AH if you don\u2019t  insist upon this.  She has shown twice (that you know of, and I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s been more) that she has no regard for her life or others and isn\u2019t capable of thinking beyond her impulsive and immediate wants.

The fact Ruby has been well-behaved before has probably influenced why you didn't take the tickets away\n\n2. The fact they were a birthday present also made you reluctant to take the tickets the first time \n\n3. You're probably a soft with her in general, maybe due to her previous good behaviour and such, amongst other things\n\nBut OP, you have no reason to feel bad. Crashing the car drunk meant you could have only had one daughter left today, could have led to other deaths. The fact she snuck out as well shows she didn't learn how serious what she did was. Kids do stupid shit at that age (and sometimes it really can be that serious) but they still have to learn the consequences of that. \n\nThe concert was something she loves deeply, but she had to learn that drunk driving can lead to her taking the lives of other people who are also loved deeply. \n\nBecause she's been well behaved before and built up currency there and that you're a bit soft on her, while she's making these terrible choices she probably feels like it'll be fine in the end and that they aren't so terrible choices really, because it's always been fine in the end. \n\nShe needed to learn that this isn't like missing homework, forgetting a chore or even cussing at a teacher. Teaching her this lesson was necessary. You feel bad because she's sad and upset at you and of course no parent wants to feel disconnected to their child but in this case, she needs to learn and remember these feelings next time she thinks she can play with her life and the lives of the people around her. \n\nAccountability matters and her reaction shows that it's hitting home for her. Accountability can feel shit sometimes, especially when bad things happen. But if she doesn't learn what it means to be accountable, at some point in the future she will have a whole host of more problems. NTA.

I would've reminded her the morning of that she wasn't going and not to invite the friend instead of waiting until the last possible minute to crush her. I think that was just mean, and she's not going to get over that for a long time. You should also be focused on WHY your kid is doing these reckless things instead of the tickets.

But you set limits for how she is to behave under your roof, she didn't follow them more than once (crashing a car - expensive, dangerous to other drivers and herself). Personally, I don't feel her losing out on a concert is that horrible (more of a first world problem type thing) however I get that it was an event she looked forward to.

BUT, given her experience drunk driving not long before that, to then go and be apprehended drunk again - I think NTA at all. \n\nI wish that the tickets removed were a response to the drunk driving and not the underaged drinking incident, as that, I feel, warrants severe punishment versus underaged drinking - regardless  of what the transgression was though, I feel strongly that if you determine the consequence it is important to carry it through or the consequence is meaningless (such as what may have occurred", "NTA.

There's no excuse for the dangerous driving,  but Ruby doesn't necessarily have deep psychological problems.\n\nThis is a problem in Ireland too: a lot of teenagers die in car accidents because there's extremely poor public transport at night.
