This story will be about Ruby. Ruby has been pretty well-behaved most of her life, but for a few months now, she has been going through what I'm guessing to be her 'rebellious phase'. One thing that hasn't changed however, is that she is still a huge 'Swiftie'. \n\nMy husband and I got Ruby 2 Eras Tour tickets for her 17th birthday. We told her that she could bring whoever she wanted with the other ticket. Recently however, she has gotten into some very serious trouble. \n\nEarlier this month, I allowed Ruby to use my car. She crashed it into a fire hydrant while drunk.   She got her license suspended and had to pay a fine. I grounded her for the rest of the summer, but still allowed her to go to the concert. But two weeks later she snuck out to go to a party, and got arrested for underaged drinking. \n\nAt this point, I've had about enough, and took away her concert tickets. She didn't seem like she cared that much and I'm guessing it's because she thought I would just give them back the day of the concert or something. Well I didn't, I thought it would be better to just sell them, she's already seen her perform before during her Reputation Tour and a few other shows. \n\nThe day of the concert, Ruby and her best friend were getting ready for the concert in her room. When they were done, Ruby came out and asked for the tickets. I told her no, that I already told her she wasn't going. Ruby looked absolutely horrified and expressed that she thought I was joking, she said that her and her friend already got ready and everything. I just told her no, she has to learn the consequences of her actions, she was lucky she didn't go to jail! Ruby started crying and went back into her room where her friend was. \n\nNow, the day after the concert Ruby isn't talking to me and I honestly feel a little bad. I know she's been looking forward to the concert for weeks. My parents have also told me it was a little harsh.

I mean I probably would\u2019ve not left my room for at least 24 hours.

It was the first time she was caught.  Statistically, this is almost 100% guaranteed.  There is likely a chance (about 40%) that alcohol wasn\u2019t the only substance.  Once there is a positive test result for alcohol, all testing stops because a positive for alcohol guarantees a conviction and almost every jurisdiction will stop testing at this point.   Have you and your daughter made a plan for how she is going to get home safely the next time alcohol or another substance is involved?  You will be the AH if you don\u2019t make a plan with her because this WILL happen again, as she\u2019s proved so to you already.  Has she had a substance use disorder evaluation?  You will also be the AH if you don\u2019t  insist upon this.  She has shown twice (that you know of, and I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s been more) that she has no regard for her life or others and isn\u2019t capable of thinking beyond her impulsive and immediate wants.

Teaching her this lesson was necessary. You feel bad because she's sad and upset at you and of course no parent wants to feel disconnected to their child but in this case, she needs to learn and remember these feelings next time she thinks she can play with her life and the lives of the people around her. \n\nAccountability matters and her reaction shows that it's hitting home for her.

Some do admit that letting a teen off for a small degree of trouble is better than making a normal teenage mistake turn life-alteringly bad.\n\nGuessing if I'd ever called them for my ride, I would have probably gotten a lecture about peer pressure and making smart choices.", "OP told her daughter she was selling the tickets, I believe.  The daughter just chose to ignore that/said she didn't think OP would follow through.", "Does OP know they were getting ready, or if they were just doing whatever in her room? They might just know it in hindsight that daughter and friend were getting ready", "Or it could just put her off drunk driving. Drink house partying is much less dangerous", "That fire hydrant could have been a family of 4, and they could have all been dead.\n\nIf anything OP has been very lenient here. I don't think she has impressed in her how series this **crime** was.", "In literally the first paragraph OP describes this as a shift in behavior that happened suddenly a few months ago.", "My money is that OP has a habit on not holding her ground. I mean there\u2019s a friend over and she\u2019s supposed to be grounded for getting in a drunk driving accident and then getting arrested for underage drinking. So clearly, there\u2019s not much follow through. I\u2019m not even someone who is big on hard discipline and punishment, but OPs account tells of a child that is in very recent months made a massive and troubling shift in behavior and personality.", "OP also probably didn\u2019t know they were specifically getting ready for the show until the daughter came down to ask for the tickets", "Ok but\u2026 grounded still means no friends come over and she doesn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s house so\u2026. Something is obviously wrong since OP doesn\u2019t say \u201cI had no idea and all of a sudden her bff showed up wanting the tickets\u201d. It was \u201cI was fully aware they were in her room getting ready and knew she assumed I was joking\u201d but I mean fuck man, you clearly WERENT serious about her being grounded so\u2026. Are you really surprised now that she\u2019s figured out her parents are wet noodles she\u2019s abusing that?", "There is a reason (we don\u2019t know) the daughter thought OP was not for real. I suspect OP is too soft and the daughter already know and takes advantage of this. There is a possibility that daughter did not have such a good behavior before the \u201crebellious phase\u201d started. If daughter dared to do so many over the top stupid things it is because there was never any consequences until now", "Fair but id expect OP to know who is in her home.", "Yeah, but who gets to have friends in their room when they are grounded?", "I don\u2019t buy that for one second. OP knew what day it was. OP knew, per OPs own words, that the daughter didn\u2019t believe her. OP let her have a friend over when she\u2019s supposedly grounded. They were getting ready so OP knew that supposedly grounded daughter was thinking she was going somewhere. OP knew that the thing that supposedly grounded daughter through she would be allowed to go to was that night. This is OPs timeline here, not the daughters. There\u2019s no way that OP was clueless as to what the daughter was thinking. In fact, OP explicitly stated they knew what the daughter was thinking. They let the build up happen. So they could cut her down. Maybe they thought it was punishment for not believing them. But they knew what was going on and chose to let it build up.", "They're teens, they flit in and out without notice", "Do they? My parents were fairly absent but they did expect to know if I had friends over. \n\nOf course expensive concerts like this were far removed from us as teens anyway, it was the 90s/00s. but if we were slicking on excessive eyeliner and drinking vodka planning to sneak into gigs, someone's parents knew. But the parents did have an idea of our locations and who we were with, not just flitting in and out."]}
