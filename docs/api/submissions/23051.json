{"id": 23051, "submission_id": "158mubv", "title": "AITA for taking away my daughter's Eras Tour tickets?", "selftext": "So I, (42f) have 2 daughters Ruby (17f), and Penelope (14f). This story will be about Ruby. Ruby has been pretty well-behaved most of her life, but for a few months now, she has been going through what I'm guessing to be her 'rebellious phase'. One thing that hasn't changed however, is that she is still a huge 'Swiftie'. \n\nMy husband and I got Ruby 2 Eras Tour tickets for her 17th birthday. We told her that she could bring whoever she wanted with the other ticket. Recently however, she has gotten into some very serious trouble. \n\nEarlier this month, I allowed Ruby to use my car. She crashed it into a fire hydrant while drunk.   She got her license suspended and had to pay a fine. I grounded her for the rest of the summer, but still allowed her to go to the concert. But two weeks later she snuck out to go to a party, and got arrested for underaged drinking. \n\nAt this point, I've had about enough, and took away her concert tickets. She didn't seem like she cared that much and I'm guessing it's because she thought I would just give them back the day of the concert or something. Well I didn't, I thought it would be better to just sell them, she's already seen her perform before during her Reputation Tour and a few other shows. \n\nThe day of the concert, Ruby and her best friend were getting ready for the concert in her room. When they were done, Ruby came out and asked for the tickets. I told her no, that I already told her she wasn't going. Ruby looked absolutely horrified and expressed that she thought I was joking, she said that her and her friend already got ready and everything. I just told her no, she has to learn the consequences of her actions, she was lucky she didn't go to jail! Ruby started crying and went back into her room where her friend was. \n\nNow, the day after the concert Ruby isn't talking to me and I honestly feel a little bad. I know she's been looking forward to the concert for weeks. My parents have also told me it was a little harsh.

Your lack of holding her accountable has led to a place where in order to get her to change you are actually going to have to be too harsh.  This is the pitfall of not instituting consequences.

I don\u2019t see a situation where my daughter (16) would not believe me in such a situation. \nI also think that you should have made sure she understood the situation and provide a way for her to \u2018win back\u2019 the tickets: paying for the damage, community work, counseling on Alcohol/drug abuse, etc. Something useful to help her realize what she was doing. The tickets would have been a great incentive.\nRight now, even if you\u2019re right, she feels you are being unfair and she won\u2019t listen to you.\nIn conclusion, you just lost a good opportunity to make her behave and to make her hear your concerns.NTA but now you missed your opportunity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a lesson which your daughter needed - let\u2019s hope that she will learn from it. \nAnd what is wrong with your parents? I know that grandparents often spoil their grandchildren and are willing to let a lot of things slide, but she was DUI, for heavens sake!", "NTA but kinda rude to just not tell them they aren't going lol I feel bad for the friend I'm sure she spent money on clothes and makeup but it was definitely justified.", "NTA. Way to be a good parent and teach her actions have consequences", "NTA, as someone that did a lot of dumb things myself as a teenager, she needs a wake up call sooner rather than later. you can only hope this is it", "NTA. Your daughter drove drunk and the only punishment you gave her is that she was kind of but apparently not really grounded and you took away her concert tickets?

But I hope you dig deeper and work with her to find out what's at the bottom of all these changes.", "100%. She was lucky to have hit a fire hydrant and not a person.", "That's what I was confused about. Like was the only punishment taking away the concert tickets? Was there no grounding, no work to be done to pay back the damages caused to the car? Good on OP for taking the tickets, but that seems like a pretty mild consequence considering the situation. I'm pretty sure I got a worse grounding for not telling my parents I was staying after school for a talent show audition and lying about it saying they changed the date last minute.", "If she gets arrested a third time, she's going to be in deep shit. I'm talking jail time.\n\nThat's going to screw up her school year.", "Sneaking out, getting drunk, then stupidly thinking you can drive is a very typical teenage rebellion.", "Eh, I\u2019m not so sure. OP is NTA for taking the tickets away, but I thought it was interesting that Ruby assumed she was getting the tickets back. Why would she assume this unless OP has gone back on punishments before? I don\u2019t think we have the whole story, or it\u2019s entirely made up.", "news flash: high school teens drink all the time without any reasons other than to get fucked up and party.", "No, I think OP  took away the tickets after the arrest for underage drinking.\nI took it to mean daughter knew she wasn't going", "She probably didn't want to be portrayed as the ahole", "Right?

And the parents ignored it [the consistent heavy drinking] as typical behaviour. Brushed it under the rug essentially. Maybe, I just live in a different culture than OP or yourself.", "If this is Ruby's first set of serious offenses, it may be that there hasn't been a reason for serious punishments. I've definitely had friends who decided they could do something bad and their parents wouldn't REALLY punish them because they've never done anything bad to be seriously punished for before.\n\nAnd even IF OP has gone back on punishment before, this is a great time to change that.\n\nNTA OP, and hopefully Ruby learns her lesson sooner rather than later, before she hurts herself or someone else", "Yeah I also thought that was odd for her to be so confident. \n\nI also don\u2019t get why she didn\u2019t just tell the friend that was invited parents what had happened and then simply not let her have her round to get ready for the concert as it wasn\u2019t really fair to the friend.\n\nI just don\u2019t get how in real life it could get to that point with the daughter and friend still thinking they were going.", "News flash, binge drinking is still a sign of an underlying stress factor. \n\nI drank in high school, never got so drunk I thought I should drive home. \n\nSecond news flash, alcohol abuse is drug abuse.
