Kind of scummy.   \n\n\nI\u2019d send her and your friend a group text (ie both of them on the same text message, so they can see both got it, use a little gentle subtle pressure!) and say \u201cHey guys, just confirming you\u2019ve got my cashapp, I got $80, was that from you \\*friends name\\*?

Thanks.\u201d And if she\u2019s still blowing you off after that you are going to face her being a bad payer big time, and either need to hunt her down face to face and say \u201cHey, now, while I watch\u2026 ok?\u201d Or \u201cWhen\u2026 let\u2019s set a date for it to come to me\u2026?\u201d But expect to never see it again (and never lend her again, and don\u2019t bother holding a dramatic grudge just know it cost you $80 to find out she doesn\u2019t care about your friendships with her/ her brother). You can ask once to your mate \u201cHey, your sister hasn\u2019t paid me back.

Paying for a tattoo is a significant expense, and you had generously offered to cover the costs upfront with the expectation of being reimbursed. Despite your social anxiety, it's important to remember that you're NOT asking for anything unreasonable. You simply want your money back.\n\nI think you have two options here: \n\nGet in touch with the sister directly. You could send her a polite and friendly message, reminding her about the agreement to reimburse you for the tattoo. You could say something like, \"Hey, I hope you're enjoying your new tattoo! I just wanted to check in about the $80 we agreed upon. Can you please send it to me through CashApp? Thanks!\"\n\nOr\n\nTalk to your friend about the situation. If you're more comfortable speaking with your friend, you could ask them to either remind their sister to pay you back or, if they're willing, cover the sister's share and then wait for the sister to reimburse them instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's your money, don't let them keep it just because you feel anxious (saying this as a very anxious person myself \ud83d\ude05)", "NTA - $80 is a lot of money.\n\nYou shouldn't have to ask a second time, but you absolutely should.\n\nLife Pro Tip: Don't apologize for asking a second time.  Don't be embarrassed.  Doing that makes it seem bigger than it is.  Just text them, \"Hey, don't forget to send me the $80 for the tattoo.  My link: zzzzzz\".  If they don't do it in a day or two, you'll have to get more persistent.", "\"sup bro, your sis hasnt payed up yet. did u forget to send her my cash app, again or is she stingy?\" NTA", "YWNBTA You would be right to ask for your money back. I can't imagine going for a tattoo and afterward saying, \"I don't have any money.\"", "NTA. If this were my sister, I'd be embarrassed as hell and pay you back myself, then sort it out with her.", "NTA but now you know to let people pay their own way unless you truly trust them. Without explicit terms, loans are more like gifts. You should give loans with the idea that you\u2019ll feel lucky if the money comes back, and ok if it doesn\u2019t. If you won\u2019t be ok if they money never comes back, you need an actual loan with a real contract, preferably from a professional creditor and not you.", "NTA. It amazes me to see people take advantage of someone so easily - you shouldn\u2019t have to ask for it, they should have just given it back to you. But sometimes people need to be spoon fed so just ask them for the money back for the tattoo. \u201cHey, how are you liking your new tattoo? Can you please send me the money I loaned to cover it? Thanks so much!\u201d", "NTA.  I owe a couple of friends money and I just got a new job.  My first and second paychecks are going to be what I'm using to pay them back.  Not paying someone back is just shitty.  Especially $80.", "Suggest to the deadbeat that you would like the money she borrowed from you.", "NTA - Just say hey there, it might've slipped your mind, but I need my $80 asap, I need to pay a bill.", "The *only* thing I can think of is that is possible friend\u2019s sister didn\u2019t have the $80 and was planning on using credit to pay it off over some months and that\u2019s the delay.
