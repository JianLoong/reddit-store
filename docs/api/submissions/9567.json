There's no way she actually believes it is reasonable to forbid you from touching her phone while demanding free access to yours. Almost as if she suspects you of something because she did that thing and maybe forgot to erase some messages.", "INFO: Since when has she been cheating?", "She\u2019s hiding something! \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't have much to add other than your girlfriend is showing several cheating red flags. Projection over insisting she has access to yours while also showing secret keeping behavior. Once people hit this level of hypocrisy I rarely see it coming back, and rarely see it not be some form of cheating. I'm sorry.", "NTA but that's a huge red flag", "Nope NTA. What\u2019s she hiding? Why she\u2019s being a hypocrite all of a sudden?? Seems to be more going on here!!", "It sounds like there's something on her phone she doesn't want you to see.

You didn't state your age,  but be grateful for the incident and move on to better horizons.     I say that because you already had an agreement for unfettered access, and now she's changing that, in addition to the double standard of she can access yours but you can't access hers.\n\nThis is a sign of cray cray behavior latter on and for other things.  You don't need this kind of stress.    Cut your losses and run.", "NTA what is she doing behind your back?  It seems like an extreme reaction if she isn\u2019t guilty of something.", "Depends. Was she upset bc you went to her phone and changed the music she was listening to (which in itself is a dick move tbh) or just using it in general? Usually if your SO is sensitive about you using their device it's because they are hiding something. I'de be more worried about that.", "Sounds like she is being sneaky to be honest. Can't have a double standard like that without reason. NTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently shady to want privacy on your phone, but the fact that she\u2019s suddenly switching up is very suspicious", "NTA - The reason she's doing this is obvious.   There's something on her phone she doesn't want you to see.  Normal bf/gf's will see it as a little rude to touch the other's phone, but for something like changing the music it would be no big deal.   \n\nI'd bet money she has texts with guys or dating apps installed.   Or is meeting guys on Instagram.   \n\nAt this point she likely will have already cleared her phone, so little point to asking her for it.  If you think you need to check her phone, it's too late and time to break up.", "She\u2019s cheating bro", "NTA. You are getting cheated on though.", "INFO It sounds more like you tried to change music she was listening without asking her. Which is different than your standard agreement that you can access each other's phones. Her not wanting you to change the music without asking is fair. Her suddenly deciding that she can have access to your phone for whatever reason but you can't see hers is wrong.\n\nMy question is why change the music without asking? Has this happened before.", "NTA. She\u2019s definitely hiding something on her phone if she freaks out when you are simply trying to change a song on it.", "NTA \n\nwhat is she doing on your phone that she doesn\u2019t want you to see", "NTA. Pretty sure she\u2019s cheating", "NTA. You should be suspicious.", "NTA, but why's she being so weird about her phone? The only time that happens is when sneaking is happening", "NTA.\n\nShe sounds like she's got something to hide with this \"I can look at your phone but you can't look at mine\" crap.", "NTA.\n\nThat being said, the tit-for-tat approach to conflict resolution is not always wise, even if it's not unethical. You might consider trying to engage her in a reasoned, calm conversation about **why** she has had this change of heart. Her answers might be enlightening.", "NTA. Sounds sus.", "ESH.  She was listening to music and you grabbed her phone to turn it off or put on something you wanted to hear.  That part makes you TA because you should have asked her if you both could listen to something else.  She is TA for her shady behavior about you never being allowed to touch her phone. The double standard about access to the cellphones is disturbing and makes me think she\u2019s hiding something.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't cool to change her music, but the double standard is unacceptable \n\nI don't think access to your partner's phone is normal or healthy btw, but you'd already established that behavior", "Nope you aren't the AH, you're just too close to catching on that she's talking to another person.   3 years and all of a sudden you can't touch the phone?", "NAH. I firmly believe that privacy is important and would never snoop or allow snooping, but the fact that she has suddenly changed her behaviour is concerning. Something has happened or is happening. I wouldn't jump to conclusions about why (everyone needs to stop obsessing over sex, it could be so many things!) but there's a reason that she's suddenly scared to let you see what's on her phone.\nDon't play the blame game. If you actually want to know what's going on, tell her that her reaction hurt you and you're confused because it's very different from what you're used to. Tell her you're worried (which you clearly are). Ask her if something happened to cause this change, or if there's something on her phone that is private that she's worried about. Let her talk, and don't assume she's cheating. If you go into it acting like you're a victim and she's a bad guy, she won't talk to you. If you approach it like a problem you two can solve together, she's more likely to be open. Whatever it is might be really scary for her to talk about, so be patient and let her know you're there for her.\nUntil this is resolved (at least), it's probably best if you both keep away from each other's phones out of respect for each other's privacy. It's okay to have things that are private.", "NTA\n\nYou should have said something instead of grabbing the phone but me think she doth protest too much.

She was entitled to being angry about that, I would have been angry about that.\n\nYou were wrong and instead of admitting it you decided to double down and try to \"punish\" her for defying you.\n\nLots of red flags here.\n\nHer suddenly deciding you can't use hers but she's entitled to access to yours is super suspect and would make me suspicious.", "yer girl is either cheating or suspects you of cheating.\n\nI'd end it. nta for this concern, but it is kinda assholeish to change music on someone rather than ask them to change it when the song ends.", "This is a very stupid hill for you both to die on. Come to an agreement or just end the relationship. ESH.", "YTA for unilaterally deciding to just change something she was listening to. Why wouldn't you just ask her to change it? Are you household Dj with executive decision making? \n\nThat being said, she cannot demand access to you phone while not letting you touch hers. That's odd.", "Sounds to me like she was telling you not to pick up her phone and change her music. YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Only on the grounds that no one is that stupid. Obviously you should have the same policy - either no one touches or you both do.
