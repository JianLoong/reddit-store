There's something on her phone she doesn't want you to see.  Normal bf/gf's will see it as a little rude to touch the other's phone, but for something like changing the music it would be no big deal.   \n\nI'd bet money she has texts with guys or dating apps installed.

I firmly believe that privacy is important and would never snoop or allow snooping, but the fact that she has suddenly changed her behaviour is concerning. Something has happened or is happening. I wouldn't jump to conclusions about why (everyone needs to stop obsessing over sex, it could be so many things!) but there's a reason that she's suddenly scared to let you see what's on her phone.\nDon't play the blame game. If you actually want to know what's going on, tell her that her reaction hurt you and you're confused because it's very different from what you're used to. Tell her you're worried (which you clearly are). Ask her if something happened to cause this change, or if there's something on her phone that is private that she's worried about. Let her talk, and don't assume she's cheating. If you go into it acting like you're a victim and she's a bad guy, she won't talk to you. If you approach it like a problem you two can solve together, she's more likely to be open. Whatever it is might be really scary for her to talk about, so be patient and let her know you're there for her.\nUntil this is resolved (at least), it's probably best if you both keep away from each other's phones out of respect for each other's privacy.
