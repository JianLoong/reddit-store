Tell her you're worried (which you clearly are). Ask her if something happened to cause this change, or if there's something on her phone that is private that she's worried about. Let her talk, and don't assume she's cheating. If you go into it acting like you're a victim and she's a bad guy, she won't talk to you. If you approach it like a problem you two can solve together, she's more likely to be open. Whatever it is might be really scary for her to talk about, so be patient and let her know you're there for her.\nUntil this is resolved (at least), it's probably best if you both keep away from each other's phones out of respect for each other's privacy.

If she wants a double standard of \"I can touch your phone but you can't touch mine,\" that's not okay, and a bit suspicious.  But if she was just annoyed that you decided to walk over and change her music without asking, then you're more the AH.  You can put on your own playlist when you're the one cleaning the house.  (Or you can both use headphones, and then everyone is happy.)", "NTA. Lots of comments have already pointed out the obvious, but she could also be embarrassed about something. The double standard is suspicious, though. I would have a honest talk with her about it.", "She Rollin, she cheatin...", "NTA better be ready for the worse. Cause to me it sounds like she's cheating", "Info: is there an anniversary or birthday coming up? Maybe she bought you something and doesn't want you to find the info on her phone. \n  If not, she be cheatin'", "Idk man, if I\u2019m cleaning and listening to music and my husband decided he just was going to change my music on my phone, that IM listening to while IM working\u2014- I would get pretty upset too.

Given her response, I'd be giving her two options: make your phone inaccessible to her as hers is to you (e.g. change all your passcode/unlock settings), or you part ways.\n\nEither way this is a major trust issue and if she won't meet you at 50/50 then I wouldn't be trying to salvage it.", "NTA, she\u2019s hiding something", "My husband also doesn\u2019t like my music. He can ask me to change it when it really doesn\u2019t agree with him but I wouldn\u2019t like it if he just went and turned it off because he doesn\u2019t like it. He too does things I don\u2019t like and I don\u2019t try to change it. If something really bothers me or him, we talk about it so the other is aware and we can also determine how important not doing something is for the other. \nHe knows I like to listen to music and sing (even if off key) while doing chores. I\u2019m very convinced it\u2019s much more fun this way and I love it. We have agreed however I will turn it down or refrain from singing when he is trying to catch a nap. I love listening to music when doing chores. If he absolutely can\u2019t deal with it he will bring me his head phones or he will ask me if we can turn it down or I might take a break from the music. I would absolutely be annoyed if he just came and turned it off or changed it. It\u2019s almost a disrespecting my likes in favour of his own. \n\nI think her reaction that you can\u2019t take her phone was more so a reaction to you turning off her music which turned into childish I can you can\u2019t blah blah. Most likely she knew while saying it, that what she said made no sense but wasn\u2019t willing to back down. Now you guys escalated it to an unnecessary bickering. Communication is key. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go as far as cheating. I can grab my husbands phone whenever I needed to and if I don\u2019t have my phone close, need to make a call or look something up he gives it to me without hesitation. I do the same with him. My phone is always around, I\u2019m forgetful, I will even leave it home at times and he also doesn\u2019t need to go through it. The one time he did grab my phone was in a playful manner I was annoyed and said no. Which triggered him as he has been cheated on before (previous relationship). He immediately started shutting down and get a look in his phase. Since I now know that it triggers him and hurts because of past experiences, I do not ever deny him the phone no matter how annoyed I am. I\u2019m not looking to hurt him that way, respect and love him even when pissed. However I will make it known that I\u2019m annoyed, and I would definitely be annoyed if I was in full on cleaning mood with my music and he would just turn it off because he doesn\u2019t like it.
