{"id": 17343, "submission_id": "13inshm", "title": "AITA for telling a small business owner that her financial struggles are not my problem?", "selftext": "I (19F) recently booked an appointment with a hairstylist. She was very highly rated so I was super excited to get my hair done with her. However, a day before the appointment, she broke her finger and had to cancel. That\u2019s fine, I understand. The issue is that her policy states a $40 cancellation fee if the appointment is canceled less than 48 hours before it was scheduled for. She tried to get me to pay this fee, and I refused since I wasn\u2019t the one that canceled the appointment. She said that she needed the $40 to make up for the money she would lose on our appointments and every appointment she would have had if she had not broken her finger, and that as a small business owner, the $40 which, according to her, \u201cis like pocket change to me and could be life-saving for her\u201d.\n\nI told her that as a college student, $40 is absolutely not pocket change to me and I would not be paying a cancellation fee for an appointment that I did not cancel. She told me that under normal circumstances, she would be more flexible with this and try to reschedule me instead of asking me to pay, but in this case, she would be out of work for months until her finger heals and really needs some extra money. She suggested getting my parents to pay the $40, but I couldn't seriously ask them to pay a woman they'd never met or done business with because she broke her finger. \n\nI don't think I'm the TA for refusing to pay a cancellation fee for an appointment I didn't cancel, but here's where I might be: I told her that her lack of money isn\u2019t my problem. She told me that that was an incredibly rude thing to say and that if I couldn\u2019t afford the cancellation fee, I couldn\u2019t afford her services, so I shouldn\u2019t have booked her in the first place. Her services were a little pricier than what I\u2019d usually go for, but I still wanted to try on the assumption that I would actually get to have my hair done. Still, there may have been a nicer way to address this and I can understand that she's in a tough situation.
