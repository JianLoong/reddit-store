{"id": 17343, "submission_id": "13inshm", "title": "AITA for telling a small business owner that her financial struggles are not my problem?", "selftext": "I (19F) recently booked an appointment with a hairstylist. She was very highly rated so I was super excited to get my hair done with her. However, a day before the appointment, she broke her finger and had to cancel. That\u2019s fine, I understand. The issue is that her policy states a $40 cancellation fee if the appointment is canceled less than 48 hours before it was scheduled for. She tried to get me to pay this fee, and I refused since I wasn\u2019t the one that canceled the appointment. She said that she needed the $40 to make up for the money she would lose on our appointments and every appointment she would have had if she had not broken her finger, and that as a small business owner, the $40 which, according to her, \u201cis like pocket change to me and could be life-saving for her\u201d.\n\nI told her that as a college student, $40 is absolutely not pocket change to me and I would not be paying a cancellation fee for an appointment that I did not cancel. She told me that under normal circumstances, she would be more flexible with this and try to reschedule me instead of asking me to pay, but in this case, she would be out of work for months until her finger heals and really needs some extra money. She suggested getting my parents to pay the $40, but I couldn't seriously ask them to pay a woman they'd never met or done business with because she broke her finger. \n\nI don't think I'm the TA for refusing to pay a cancellation fee for an appointment I didn't cancel, but here's where I might be: I told her that her lack of money isn\u2019t my problem. She told me that that was an incredibly rude thing to say and that if I couldn\u2019t afford the cancellation fee, I couldn\u2019t afford her services, so I shouldn\u2019t have booked her in the first place. Her services were a little pricier than what I\u2019d usually go for, but I still wanted to try on the assumption that I would actually get to have my hair done. Still, there may have been a nicer way to address this and I can understand that she's in a tough situation.

Wow, the audacity!!!!! You didn't cancel, so there is no cancellation fee. Simple. Maybe ask her to pay $40 for cancelling.", "This is one of those times you should write a review and tell everyone with screenshots of her messages. \n\n\u201cDo not book with this stylist, she tried to charge me $40 when she canceled on me and tried to guilt me into paying it\u201d.", "Imagine running a business like that. No need to show up, just cancel the appointments and cash in on those sweet cancelation fees.", "I'd guess that she figured OP was a kid that she could pressure into just doing what she wanted. (Esp with the parents comment) \n\nNTA for sure", "One of my kids goes to a tattoo shop that charges $100 to book an appointment. If you cancel, you lose the $100. Last year, the artist canceled the appointment and rebooked for 2 months out. Then canceled again and rebooked 2 months later. By then, it was starting to get into the warm months, and my kids work at an outdoor bar. Anyone who has tattoos knows that if you are going to be outside in the heat all day, you don't want to get a new tattoo as the sweat can cause healing problems and also causes the new work to sting and burn. So the 3rd time the artist canceled and rescheduled, my kid told the artist to please just refund the deposit because they couldn't get a new tattoo for the next 5 months or so. The artist refused, saying that they were willing to reschedule, and it was now my kid that was canceling. It took multiple calls to the shop owner, and 4 days before my kid was offered a same day tattoo with another artist or a refund. \n\nTurns out the greed of the original artist bit her in the rear. Because my kid took the same day tattoo with another artist and absolutely loved their work. Now, 5 of my 6 kids all go to the new artist instead of the old artist. All told, over the past year, the old artist has lost out on about $10,000 in business between the 5 of them.\n\nEdit: spelling \n\nAnd OP, NTA.", "Right, just make 40 appointments a day and cancel them all. The lazy man's get rich quick scheme.", "The stylist's demand is the stupidest thing I've ever read. What a business model: contract your services with a lot of people, break your own finger so you couldn't perform the service, then charge all of them with a cancellation fee. That is a scam, NTA.", "Yeah even if her finger heals, never go back there.x", "NTA she needs to Google what cancellation fee means. It doesn't mean free money.", "Right OP should have told the stylist to pay her a 40 cancellation fee lol", "Exactly! It\u2019s to help compensate the stylist for losing out on potential money. \nIt isn\u2019t to punish the customer when the stylist can\u2019t do her job. Is she going to charge cancellation fees for the next three weeks she is off?\n\n*edit punch to punish. Although it\u2019s the same insult essentially!", "I cannot imagine having the nerve of this woman! What in the fresh hell?!", "As a business owner she should have had insurance to cover things like this. Sole trader insurance is a thing and exists for exactly this type of situation.", "And post screenshots of her bullshit to those \u201chighly rated\u201d online review sites. If any \u201cbusiness owner\u201d was trying to pull this on me, I\u2019d like some warning.", "This reminds me of the season 6 episode 17 Seinfeld episode\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_Hello\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HMke86MTWW8?t=55", "Nta. Ive never heard of a business canceling and then trying to charge you a cx fee. It defies logic.", "Not everyone is able to save 2-3 month living expenses. But that isn\u2019t OP\u2019s fault or responsibility since he didn\u2019t cancel", "A situation which can be insured against, but she chose not to despite being more expensive than average, and desperate for the income.", "Absolutely. \n\nU/throwawayrefusetopay this is definitely review worthy. Any other clients she tried to pull this unscrupulous nonsense with either also refused or were horribly taken advantage of. \n\nThis hairstylist may be very good, and she may in fact be in a bad financial position, but all that means is that she should be apologetic about canceling and doing her best to keep the good will of her clients so they come back to her later. \n\nInstead, what she\u2019s doing sounds like a con or a scam at worst, and manipulation and poor business sense at best. That\u2019s something worth making potential customers aware of. \n\nYou do not pay for services you did not receive through no fault of your own. If you feel like being kind, you can tell her that she has no legal right to any fees from you, and that if she continues her harassment, you will leave detailed reviews about this on yelp, google, Facebook, etc, to warn her customers of the risk of hiring her. \n\nIt also would be totally fair if you just started leaving reviews right now. Keep screenshots of your conversation or save voicemails to document your experience, and post reviews that are 100% truthful. Then even if she tries to threaten you to take them down, you will be absolutely in the right and will be able to prove it.", "One weird trick for making unlimited money.", "Happy cake day! \ud83c\udf70\ud83c\udf82\ud83e\uddc1", "The stylists could have insured her hands in case this happens \nAll stylist should do this", "If they even broke it and this isn't just an outright scam", "Don\u2019t I know it! I didn\u2019t clarify in my original comment but that wasn\u2019t me shaming the hairdresser for not having enough income to have a savings. Just me pointing out how important it is to have one of you can manage (the amount of people who say it\u2019s unnecessary even if they can budget it out cuz \u201cthey\u2019re young so they won\u2019t get sick\u201d is astounding)", "I didn\u2019t even notice, thanks!", "Not me thinking the same."]}
