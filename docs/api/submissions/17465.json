I know a lot of people would be pissed at hearing about it all the time but I find it to be hilarious. And dad is really not the kind of person to push boundaries. He did the same thing in the past to my brother and after he said he didn't like it dad immediately stopped. It's been over a year and not a single mention of grandbaby has been made to my brother. I not only have never complained to my dad about his jokes, I have joked back, started them, teased him. \n\nOne more thing, we come from very 'traditional' culture that is nowhere near joining the 21st century, and in my friend circle we are all childless and around 30. I'm sure you get the picture.\nFew days ago, I had some friend over. Among them was Lana. Her family is to put it lightly extremely judgemental and very firm on gender roles and a 'right' way to live. They have been driving her crazy for ages now with all the regular misogynistic b******t. \n\nI was in the middle of making dinner when I heard a notification go off on my phone. Asked if someone could see what it was and it was a message from dad. I told another friend to read it and it was a rant about how one of his friends got a grand baby no 4 and he has none blah blah blah. This has become a pretty standard way of us telling each other that somebody we know has a new baby in their life.\nI started to laugh cause it was one of the best rants so far (practise makes perfect I guess) and told my friend to write back ''send my congrats to Mr. Lastname. And ask if he'll let you borrow one from time to time, its your best shot'.\n\n She did and all of us had a laugh about it. Except Lana. She was quite for a minute and then just exploded and went on a bad rant about it. If she was speaking just out of frustration and in general I would've let it go but she made it all about my dad, called him disgusting and all sort of names. I told her to chill, it's just a joke between us and it's fine. She got even more angry and went after me also, now calling both of us all sort of things. I told her she has no right to tell me what I can and cannot joke about with my father. That I'm sorry her family has been awful to her about it and I'm more than willing not to mention any of it in front of her anymore but I will not tolerate anyone speaking to me like that and calling my dad names when he did nothing to deserve it. And if she can't be civil I will have to ask her to leave. She got up furious, got her things and left while still calling us names and yelling.\n\nThe night went on somewhat sour but ok, but the next morning I got text from two people in the group chat telling me I was really unfair to Lana and I could show some compassion to her knowing how bad she has it. This has sparked a huge argument in the group and the opinions are all over the place.\n\nSo good people of reddit, was I wrong for what I said to Lana?", "created_utc": 1684318087, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jxg8i/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_over_her_rant/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once you told her you were fine with your dad that should have been the end of it. - Well really the end of it should have been when she heard what your response to his text was cos that was hillarious, but I digress.\n\nBy telling you what you should or shouldn't put up with she is doing the same thing to you that she accuses your dad of doing because she is telling you how to live your life which is her problem with her family just in reverse. If she wants to live in an equitable world then you should feel free to make jokes with your dad. Just as she should be free to make her own life choices.", "NTA.  She\u2019s ridiculous and extremely disrespectful.  She is incapable (or unwilling) to see life through the lense of someone who\u2019s had a different experience than herself, and how entitled and awful of her to insult your family.", "NTA. My God, the joke had nothing to do with her. She got triggered by it. You explained it. She lashed out even more. You even told her it wouldn't happen again in her presents. Nope, in the way you wrote it and in my opinion you made everything right. You don't have to tolerate disrespectful bs in your home. Behave or go. Simple.\n\nI'm sorry for her that it's difficult between her and her family. Still no excuse to act like that.", "NTA, If she has it bad that's a shame but no excuse to shit on someone else's business. It's your dad's and yours joke if she's offended about it that's her problem.", "NTA - it\u2019s a private joke.. I feel for her but she needs to deal with it in a more productive manner than abusing you and your dad", "NTA. \nThat was a completely inappropriate way for Lana to handle her frustration. What did your friends expect you to do? You gave her the option to be civil and stated what would happen if she couldn\u2019t. She refused\u2026 and that\u2019s on her. Good for you for setting a boundary and sticking to it!! Not an easy situation but I think you handled it perfectly.", "Clear NTA. Lana was abusive towards you in your own home. You explained that your situation was different from hers and asked her to stop and she responded by escalating her abuse. The fact that she \u201chas it tough\u201d doesn\u2019t give her the right to treat you and your father like a punching bag. Lana owes you an apology.", "NTA you were right on everything, your life, your father you and you alone get to decide if you enjoy this banter with your dad\n\nI get why she hates it, due to her own family, but she had no right to call your dad names and go yelling/ranting at you\n\nYour friends are wrong, they should save their comments for Lana since she was far out of line\n\nIm staunchly childfree and hate these comments, i would at most check in with you to see if you were truly ok with it just so you feel supported and once you said yes that would be the end of it", "NTA. It's a joke between you and your father, you offered to stop mentioning the subject after seeing how much it triggered her but she's the one kept insulting you and your father. You have every right to set boundaries and not take that attitude from someone. If she wanted compassion she shouldn't have insulted to your face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But NTA, it wasn't said to her, and it wasn't said about her.\n\nCould you have been nicer? Sure. But rarely am I calm or nice when my parents and myself are being verbally attacked. Her baggage. Her drama. Sorry she's got it. Wouldn't change for it.", "NTA", "NTA. I believe you can be compassionate and angry at the same time and I believe you were.\n\nExpressing anger openly is very often socially punished even when it is fully justified. That's all that is happening.", "NTA. Lana needs to realize that your situation is different from hers. She needs to understand that you and your Father can joke about this and it has absolutely nothing to do with her and her family.", "NTA\n\nYou're a good sport.", "NTA. It's a thing that you and your dad feel very comfortable joking around about. Honestly, it sounds like you two have an awesome relationship. It also sounds like your dad is perfectly accepting of boundaries(the bit about your brother). \nLana has issues she needs to work on without lashing out at others.\n\nSide note: the convo with your dad and your response got me to snort laugh so thank you.", "NTA.\nNobody gets to disrespect you and your father because of their own personal and psychological baggage.\nIf Lana won\u2019t sincerely apologize, be done with her.", "NTA. Interesting that Lana fights back against the infringement of her autonomy by attempting to take away your autonomy. Just leave her alone and give a simple \u201cno thanks\u201d to anyone trying to tell you to kiss up to her.", "ESH. \n\n>My dad has a bad case of grandbaby fever and has made it well known.

Literally describing him pushing boundaries while saying he's not pushing boundaries. \n\nLana was over the top but your Dad is being an asshole. Don't read his texts to others if you don't want them judging him for being gross.", "I'm so confused", "NTA Lana was out of line. What goes on between you and your father is your business not hers. Apparently Lana never heard of the old saying \"If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say it at all\".", "Lana made it personal against your father.  That is where she steeped over the line. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Your telling Lana that you would no longer mention the issue in front of her is your showing her compassion. She does not get to disrespect you and your father (in your home no less) regardless of much of a hard time she\u2019s going through. She owes YOU an apology\u2026not vice versa. And your friends should not defend bad behavior.", "NTA. You and your dad aren't responsible for Lana's home problems, and you certainly don't deserve to be lambasted for them. You are right to stand up for your dad.", "NTA, it was an in joke with your dad in a conversation she wasn't even part of and she went off like a bomb and refused to dial it back. You showed compassion when you asked her to calm down rather than kicking her out immediately, but instead she escalated. Given you mentioned the group being split over it, I have to wonder how accurate her description of what happened actually was and if she's maybe worded it to sound more sympathetic to others in the group", "NTA. Lana can kick rocks. All sympathy ends when she unfairly attacked someone she doesn't even know", "I don't even understand what her rant was about?", "I\u2019m just going to add that although I feel bad for Lana and her situation, using one\u2019s history as an excuse to be disrespectful or to justify rude behavior makes one TA almost every time.", "What? OP even states they enjoy the back and forth joking about the subject so how is it pushing a boundary if OP never once established it as a boundary and in fact likes it? I\u2019m thinking you and Lana both might need to hear that *your* boundary isn\u2019t everyone else\u2019s boundary.", "He is not pushing a boundarie if it's not a boundarie for OP. She finds it hilarious. And she didn't read the Text to others. Someone of her friends read the Text to her because she was busy. Lana just got caught in the middle and decided to go nuke.", "There's no boundary to push. OP clearly enjoys the jokes/banter and it's been a way for them to have fun with each other. She even included that her brother didn't like the jokes and the father immediately stopped.", "can you clearly explain what boundaries OP\u2019s dad has pushed with who then?", "Compare to \"my father likes to send misogynistic rants towards me all the time. But it's a funny joke! When I read the texts to my friends though they get mad and how very dare they.\" \n\nEspecially in a culture that OP even SAYS is no where near joining the 21st century. They even call it a rant not even a short comment of \"so and so had a baby, when are you having one?\" (Which is still kinda gross)\n\nThey can have their in-joke, but involving other people in what's clearly something that's not going to go over well then being all shocked Pikachu is an ahole move.", "NTA Why do some people go into other peoples homes and lives and magically expect everyone to be a mind reader to their personal needs?  Then when not fulfilled abuse that home and family? Just stay home if you think everything revolves around you and everyone should already know all your trauma and prejudices", "NTA. Another example of an entire generation who must be shielded from opposing thoughts. Yikes.", "NTA. If Lana has such a hard time with a disrespectful family dynamic, why in the world would she want to have the same dynamic with her friends? You are not her. Your dad is not her family. She blew up at the wrong people and should be mature enough to admit that.", "NTA. Obviously the issue of kids is super triggering to her.. there is literally *nothing* to be upset about in this exchange. This isn't about what you or your dad said, it's about whatever her family has been saying to her. Still absolutely no excuse for her behavior.", "NTA - How could sticking up for yourself make you an asshole.", "NTA - her family issues are not your problem nor do they create an emergency on you to make her feel better. People have all sorts of problems and things that set them off if she was that upset about it she should go off on her family not her supposed friend.", "This. Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf NTA", "I'm giving her some space and time,but I've known her for a long time and I'm pretty sure, once she's had time to calm down and think it through, she'll reach out and we'll talk it out.\n\nWe are really good friends and even though it doesn't sound like it she likes my dad a lot so I think it will be fine. I know she is going through a lot right now", "We as a family joke all the time. We all like to dish it and in return had to learn to take it as well. But we never want to hurt each other, any time a topic comes up somebody isn't comfortable with it automatically becomes of limit. I guess its just that I know with 100% certainty he is just messing with me that I don't take it as any kind of pressure or him meddling and that's why I can so comfortably joke about it. Some other people have gone there with me too and were shot down immediately. \n\nI mean I can hardly complain about him being mean to me, last time he asked for a suggestion for a vacation I sent him a link to a nursing home so... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That is exactly why I couldn't let it go. Just a general rant or one about her situation and I wouldn't say anything except maybe if she'd like to talk about it over more wine. Like I get it, you're going through a lot and we have been friends forever, let it all out I'm here for you.\n\nBut my dad has been nothing but really nice and helpful to her and I just couldn't stand to listen to her talk about him like that cause her own majorly sucks.", "That's the most baffling part,she has known my dad for 15 years and always liked him a lot. She even asked his advice about her career completely on her own because it's similar field as his and she knew how great of a support he was to me with mine (both are heavily male dominated).\n\nI know this whole thing has nothing to do with either him or I, which is why I started to doubt if I should have let it go, because she is clearly struggling a lot with it all.", "Honestly so am I and I was there", "Technically, it was about OP's dad, but in realty, it was about her own family - which, given that what she was ranting about was true, is understandable.\n\nBut it's not true about OP's dad, so OP is NTA for telling her to stop or leave.", "How is it a misogynistic rant about not having a grand baby when he did the same shit to his son?"]}
