That's not going to get better, it's only going to progress, and dementia patients need constant supervision. Unless one of you is willing to stay home to be a full time caregiver (and you can support four people on one income and two SS payments), she has to go into a facility specializing in dementia and Alzheimer's care. Even if you can afford 24/7 home health aides, at some point she will have to be moved. The more her disease progresses, the harder that transition will be. The most responsible, and the kindest, thing to do is to put her in the best facility you can afford long term.\n\nThen your husband should talk to your FIL. What does he want? Would he prefer to stay as close to his wife as possible? If he wants to see her everyday, then you're looking for a facility that can house them both. If FIL would rather not be in a facility (fair!), then you have to ask if your home can be reasonably made accessible for him. Ramps to get into the home, a first floor bedroom, a barrier free bathroom. If your home can't accommodate that, then you have to find other options for him. If your home could accommodate that with some remodeling, then you have the question of who pays for it and how that affects the prenup.\n\nOP, for now your parents are at the easy part of retirement. They don't need medical care, they're mobile, and living with you means saving against the day their living expenses rise. And it's your house.

BS. \n\nMy mother, a RN, took care of my father the last years of his life-he had Alzheimer\u2019s. We, the kids, helped when we could. My mother never fully recovered physically or mentally, after his death. She simply was exhausted. \n\nFrom personal experience, no easy or even good answers for this. Good luck!", "NTA.

He fucking sucks for saying that you need to care for his unpleasant and highly needy parents because you\u2019re his wife. That\u2019s awful. You work full time.

There is a big difference in the two scenarios that he doesn't seem to grasp. My husband and I actually discussed what would happen when our parents get to that point.  His mom has passed but we've decided - together- that his dad will go to a home (he is a hoarder and stubborn), we would be willing to move in with my parents if needed and would let my dad move in with us but not my mom as she's not good with boundaries.  My point being, each personality and situation is unique, and both of you need to be on the same page. If my husband said that I  HAD to do something, he'd be at the curb.", "NTA if you\u2019re unable to comfortably care for his parents that\u2019s kinda the end of it it\u2019s not fair of him to expect you to sacrifice like that. It\u2019s also very mature if you you respect his wishes if he also doesn\u2019t want your able parents to move in. It\u2019s a difficult situation you\u2019re in as wanting to care for one\u2019s parents is very understandable but it\u2019s not fair for one of you to have to shoulder the majority of the burden.

That, plus your willingness to have him move out to care for his parents suggests that your house isn't a stable situation for either set of parents.\n\nIt sounds like you need to consult with either a retirement specialist and/or a divorce lawyer.", "Who owns the house is not relevant here and should  not be used as a bargaining chip.\n\nI'd say  at this stage, NAH, although that could change if the  argument is allowed to stagnate. End of the day, you both have reasonable and understandable positions, and it's important to keep in mind that  neither  of you is operating  from a position of rationality here. Both of you have strong emotional positions, and  the arguments  that are being made here, on either side, are not necessarily  correct, they're things your brains have come up with to  try to justify the emotions, and just disproving those arguments doesn't change the underlying emotions, so it's not necessarily going  to  be a matter of which one of you is more correct.\n\nSpeaking personally though, I think  you're right that his parents are going to need to go into  a home, if not now then at some point. I have a good bit of experience with dementia, and there does come a point where they  just aren't safe to live alone, and full-time in-house care is practically never feasible. However, again bear in mind the emotions involved here. Everyone hates having to put their  parents in a home. You shouldn't be trying to \"win\" this, because if you do, you'll just foster  resentment. What your husband needs is support in what may well be the single  most stressful, most emotional decision of  his life  so far. You can assert that they won't be  living  with you, it's good to have that boundary, but you need to deal with that separately to the question of where your parents will live, because if you don't, he's probably going to see it as a competition where you're screwing his parents over for the sake of your own. Even if that's true, the real core of the issue should be  his  parents' health, and it'll help you to  keep the focus on that if you don't push on whether your parents will move in until  that's sorted. \n\nYou also may want to consider therapy  for yourself, him or both of you, separately or together, even if just to have some support and a way of working through emotions. There  are  dementia charities too that run helplines, and it can be worth talking to  those sorts of things to get more information and options.", "[deleted]", "ESH You can't pick and choose your family over your husband's. Both sets of parents should either not be in the house with you or they all come. I see you're willing to compromise, so you're less on the AH. He needs to think logically about this as well. If he wants his parents to move in, he can quit his job to become their paid live in nurse, and if your parents aren't too bad off may I suggest building them an in-law suite on your land. That way, they have their own space, and you can go visit them in the back if the in laws are getting ornery.", "NTA - tell him it\u2019s your house and you\u2019ll make the call.

You have every right to say you don't want them to live with you.  \n\nHowever,  your husband has every right to not want extra guests as well.

Under no circumstances would I be okay with living with them, so I wanted to get straight to the point about it", "How is this ESH. \n\nShe communicates a solution that will help both sets of parents without being too much of a burden for them. \n\nHe's furious, demands she doesn't help her parents at all, and that she takes on the majority of the burden to help his, relying on misogynistic gender tropes to demand such. \n\nAnd then she communicates a clear boundary that she won't be doing that, and that makes her an AH? Yeah, no.", "There isn\u2019t room to build anything on the land.

It's not really reasonable to say \"both should come or neither should\" as a blanket statement, because they need different things. OP came up with a practical suggestion that allows them to assist both sets of parents with what they ACTUALLY need, without being too much of a burden on OP and her husband. \n\nIt might not be exactly equal treatment, but it is targeted to help them in fair and equal ways.", "Yeah, But the parents are not equivalent. If both were just in a bad financial situation then yeah, I\u2019d agree, but his are highly needy, need constant care and attention and would be a financial drain. Hers are independent and healthy and would contribute financially. \n\nAlso his parents are, per op, not appreciative and she doesn\u2019t like them. Which does matter. Whether OP is right or wrong in her assessment that they\u2019re unpleasant doesn\u2019t really matter, OP, the person who is expected to be the main caregiver doesn\u2019t like the charges and says they\u2019re unpleasant to her\u2026 \n\nI do agree that this is probably a situation where neither will be moving in, but they just aren\u2019t the same situation at all and OP is NTA for not wanting to be a full time caretaker to people she doesn\u2019t like on top of a full time job, in a home she owns independently.

She said so here:\n\n> I told him if he decides to stay I\u2019ll respect his decision of not wanting my parents to move in, and I can look into other options for them. \n\nThat's a vote. \n\nHe definitely should not get a vote on whether or not he can force her to become their full-time caretaker. Why should he get a vote on that?", "Okay but also I think that the fact that half of Husband\u2019s Parent\u2019s kids ending up addicts or in jail says a lot about those parents.\n\nThey seem like unappreciative assholes, and tinder hood on her for signing that prenup.

For example, \"I don't want them living with us\" is truthful, and straight to the point, but leaves a lot of room for interpretation. And your husband may be hearing \"my parents are more important than yours\".\n\nI'm not saying that this is what happened. I'm also not saying that you need to spend infinite effort to clarify what you mean; Your husband also needs to put some effort in interpreting your intent.\n\nWhat works for me (your milage may vary) is to acknowledge the needs that need to be addressed: both pairs of parents need to be taken care of, you need to feel appreciated in your home, he needs to feel that the parents are getting the same quality of care, etc.\n\nIf course, this only works if husband is on board with the communication strategy, so there might be some setup discussion too.\n\nI also don't agree with ESH, I think communication issues are NAH most of the time, since much of resolving these issues relies on not placing blame.", "I understand. Sorry, I was merely spitballing, but still, I would just help your parents find something nearby for cheap.

Perhaps husband's tune will change, but maybe not, regardless, she's thinking more logically.  Husband and sister need to discuss care facilities for their parents now.", "I would still say it's a bit insensitive to discuss moving in her parents when he's concerned about his, but every other point I absolutely agree with.

Her piece has been said, and her worry is finding her parents a place close by that is cheap and accessible as her parents get older.", "I\u2019m an MD and have a parent with dementia as well, so I 100% get where you are coming from. Also if his Mum is already wandering, you and I both know how much of a safety hazard this is to manage. \n\nSometimes I like to tell my patients\u2019 family members that their loved one has reached the point where no single person can be managing their care. No one doctor or nurse or social worker can do what we all can do collectively. I\u2019m not a hospital; it\u2019s an unrealistic expectation to put on a single person.  Safety comes first, health next and third is everything else. His Mum is at the point where she needs a collective effort to keep her safe, healthy, and so that you and your husband can continue to have your relationships as family and not primary caregivers.\n\nWishing you well in whatever you choose. Hugs from Canada!", "Op wants to live with her parents, is it that crazy to just move home?", "In my comment, I said that the only AH behavior she demonstrated was the way she was talking about her ownership of the house.", "I don't disagree, but he clearly doesn't see it that way. And so, her choice is really between finding a compromise that saves her marriage or making her own choice. That's difficult.", "Getting married means you build a life TOGETHER.

It\u2019s a bad situation, no doubt about it, and it sucks, but I still can\u2019t condemn Op as an AH for not wanting to caretake like that\u2026 \nIf they had better communication op probably wouldn\u2019t have suggested her parents during the same convo. It\u2019s probably a multi phase discussion that needs to take place over time to help everyone process", "When she already owns her own home? Yes of course are you senile?", "Because divorces happen sometimes? Like over 1/3 marriages end in divorce nowadays.

She would leave jobs for me to do round the house whilst I was working. I was already dropping the kids off in the morning and picking them up at around 14:00 (during my working hours). Then looking after them until I finished at 17:30. The last bit wasn't so bad as they were old enough to occupy themselves.

If you cut down on your working hours to take care of his parents than who is going to provide for your household? Also you shouldn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s unreasonable. His entire request is ridiculous and he doesn\u2019t have the financial standing to really back what he wants. The house is yours, you have more income, really the decision is yours. Maybe a trial separation would show him just how much you contribute to his life would help him have more appreciation??", "My husband was unwilling to put his mom in a home and insisted she move in with us. Since we both own the home I was not given a choice, he just moved her in. I make more money then him but he works more hours so I had to care for her most of the time. Biggest mistake of my life, the toil it took on my health and sanity was unbearable. She died within a year but if she had not I had already decided I was moving out. All this to say you are so smart to put your foot down and not let his parents move in.\n\nBTW I think you handled everything well and communicated perfectly.

It\u2019s a worst case scenario insurance policy? Why drive if you\u2019re afraid of getting in a car wreck? Why have kids if you\u2019re afraid of dying in child birth?

That's not why she's here.", "Sorry, I didn't mean to put you in the hot seat to defend being with him. I'm not actually of the opinion that someone must contribute equally to be in a relationship, I just think he's acting very entitled in this instance given that he contributes less than you, and is currently demanding you do even more", "Sounds like such a loving couple lol", "That\u2019s great that your job allows so much freedom but why would you spend that time with his parents when you could spend it with yours?!? I missed the cultural differences part. That can be impossible to overcome. Not only is it ingrained deep in his brain (even if he doesn\u2019t admit it) but his family will peer pressure him on something like this.

It's not bad in every situation, each situation is different and separations like this are reasonable in many situations, but it's not in yours. Separation is supposed to be a tool to see the difference between being together and being apart, and learn which way of being makes you happiest.\n\nYou're already (validly) concerned that he's taking you for granted, and given his lack of job opportunity, significant debt, and current lifestyle being financed by you, all that a separation is in this case is trump card you have to demonstrate to him just how dependent on you he is. He will not have the opportunity to see \"with you or without you\" from any sort of emotional, or romantic aspect. What he will see is a drastic drop in quality of life that will have to prioritized. It cannot be a tool for him to discover if he really wants to be in the relationship.\n\nIf he \"changes\", it will never be genuine change. It will be coercion, and the problems will eventually come back worse.\n\nAbsolutely communicate how you feel taken for granted, that his expectation that you'll play caregiver to his parents is unreasonable, be firm in your boundaries. But if it comes time that you need to separate, you should just skip a trial and go straight to divorce.", "Like I said op can put them into a senior duplex.", "Did you even like him", "I agree", "You make a good point.
