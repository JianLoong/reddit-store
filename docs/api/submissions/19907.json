They can no longer stay in their home. Due to mil wandering the street recently, adult social services have been involved. He has two siblings, one is an addict and is in prison.

I think he thought I would cave but I\u2019m not. Our marriage is done. And honestly, I\u2019m okay with it. I bring a lot more to the table, and I\u2019m ready to be with someone who\u2019s an equal partner. Certain aspects of his culture I admire, but the relentless idea of sacrificing everything so your parents are comfortable is something I don\u2019t agree with. They\u2019ve always treated me poorly and I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice for them. \n\nMy husband packed some clothes, and is going to stay on his friends couch for a while. I\u2019m going to move my parents in later this month, and I\u2019m going to change the locks and move his stuff out to a storage unit tomorrow.

He doesn\u2019t make enough to pay for their care, so they\u2019re probably going to go to the only nursing home in the area that works with Medicare. It\u2019s a truly awful place rampant with abuse and neglect, which does suck for them. But they treated me like shit so, that\u2019s life I guess.\n\nEdit pt 2: a lawyer can\u2019t represent us both apparently, and can only mediate us both. Shitty but whatever.

That's not going to get better, it's only going to progress, and dementia patients need constant supervision. Unless one of you is willing to stay home to be a full time caregiver (and you can support four people on one income and two SS payments), she has to go into a facility specializing in dementia and Alzheimer's care. Even if you can afford 24/7 home health aides, at some point she will have to be moved. The more her disease progresses, the harder that transition will be. The most responsible, and the kindest, thing to do is to put her in the best facility you can afford long term.\n\nThen your husband should talk to your FIL. What does he want? Would he prefer to stay as close to his wife as possible? If he wants to see her everyday, then you're looking for a facility that can house them both. If FIL would rather not be in a facility (fair!), then you have to ask if your home can be reasonably made accessible for him. Ramps to get into the home, a first floor bedroom, a barrier free bathroom. If your home can't accommodate that, then you have to find other options for him. If your home could accommodate that with some remodeling, then you have the question of who pays for it and how that affects the prenup.\n\nOP, for now your parents are at the easy part of retirement. They don't need medical care, they're mobile, and living with you means saving against the day their living expenses rise. And it's your house.

BS. \n\nMy mother, a RN, took care of my father the last years of his life-he had Alzheimer\u2019s. We, the kids, helped when we could. My mother never fully recovered physically or mentally, after his death. She simply was exhausted. \n\nFrom personal experience, no easy or even good answers for this. Good luck!", "NTA.

There is a big difference in the two scenarios that he doesn't seem to grasp. My husband and I actually discussed what would happen when our parents get to that point.  His mom has passed but we've decided - together- that his dad will go to a home (he is a hoarder and stubborn), we would be willing to move in with my parents if needed and would let my dad move in with us but not my mom as she's not good with boundaries.  My point being, each personality and situation is unique, and both of you need to be on the same page. If my husband said that I  HAD to do something, he'd be at the curb.", "NTA if you\u2019re unable to comfortably care for his parents that\u2019s kinda the end of it it\u2019s not fair of him to expect you to sacrifice like that.

It\u2019s a difficult situation you\u2019re in as wanting to care for one\u2019s parents is very understandable but it\u2019s not fair for one of you to have to shoulder the majority of the burden.

That, plus your willingness to have him move out to care for his parents suggests that your house isn't a stable situation for either set of parents.\n\nIt sounds like you need to consult with either a retirement specialist and/or a divorce lawyer.", "Who owns the house is not relevant here and should  not be used as a bargaining chip.\n\nI'd say  at this stage, NAH, although that could change if the  argument is allowed to stagnate. End of the day, you both have reasonable and understandable positions, and it's important to keep in mind that  neither  of you is operating  from a position of rationality here. Both of you have strong emotional positions, and  the arguments  that are being made here, on either side, are not necessarily  correct, they're things your brains have come up with to  try to justify the emotions, and just disproving those arguments doesn't change the underlying emotions, so it's not necessarily going  to  be a matter of which one of you is more correct.\n\nSpeaking personally though, I think  you're right that his parents are going to need to go into  a home, if not now then at some point. I have a good bit of experience with dementia, and there does come a point where they  just aren't safe to live alone, and full-time in-house care is practically never feasible. However, again bear in mind the emotions involved here. Everyone hates having to put their  parents in a home. You shouldn't be trying to \"win\" this, because if you do, you'll just foster  resentment. What your husband needs is support in what may well be the single  most stressful, most emotional decision of  his life  so far. You can assert that they won't be  living  with you, it's good to have that boundary, but you need to deal with that separately to the question of where your parents will live, because if you don't, he's probably going to see it as a competition where you're screwing his parents over for the sake of your own. Even if that's true, the real core of the issue should be  his  parents' health, and it'll help you to  keep the focus on that if you don't push on whether your parents will move in until  that's sorted. \n\nYou also may want to consider therapy  for yourself, him or both of you, separately or together, even if just to have some support and a way of working through emotions. There  are  dementia charities too that run helplines, and it can be worth talking to  those sorts of things to get more information and options.", "[deleted]", "ESH You can't pick and choose your family over your husband's. Both sets of parents should either not be in the house with you or they all come. I see you're willing to compromise, so you're less on the AH. He needs to think logically about this as well. If he wants his parents to move in, he can quit his job to become their paid live in nurse, and if your parents aren't too bad off may I suggest building them an in-law suite on your land. That way, they have their own space, and you can go visit them in the back if the in laws are getting ornery.", "NTA - tell him it\u2019s your house and you\u2019ll make the call.

If you work an hour or two a day and then take a little downtime to go to the gyn, go out with friends, and so forth, if your parents move in who is going to watch them while you're busy? It's one thing to think you know what living with a mother who has dementia and wanders and a father who has mobility issues will be like. It's something else entirely to actually do that. \n\nYour husband is a twit for expecting you to take care of his parents and put yours in a facility with carers, but are you asking him to look after your parents while you're doing other things? Because looking after your parents, as you've described them, is going to be a full time job for someone, unless they can afford to pay for in-home help about 14-16 hours a day.\n\nI don't think either of you is being very realistic about what living with either set of high-needs older parents will be like. Having a background in nursing and having perhaps seen dementia patients and high-needs older adults professionally doesn't prepare you for what it will be like to care for high-needs older adults in your own home. It's a full time job, and unless BOTH you and your husband are willing to commit to this for either set of parents, you really need to make alternate arrangements for both sets of parents. And then the thing you need to do for them is visit them often and without warning, so that whatever facilities they're in will be sure to actually take care of them.\n\nAgain, no judgment as I don't think either of you knows what you'd be getting into, although your husband is an a$$ for expecting you to do the lion's share of the work for his parents rather than for your own.", ">Op's husband has zero clue.

He can\u2019t afford a lawyer so I\u2019ll find one to represent us both, and that\u2019ll be it.\n\nA spouse cannot be removed from the marital home. Its illegal. He can come back and demand entry. You call police. He shows his ID and shows he has residence, the cop will demand you let him in. His divorce lawyer will offer to help him get back in the home. He can call the police to demand entry. If you were divorced it would be an illegal eviction. Its called a \"constructive\" eviction. \n\nLawyers are paid by marital assets. You cannot force a lawyer on him. He can get one and the lawyer will be paid out of marrital assets. Prenup does not matter. If Melania divorces donald trump, her divorce lawyer will be paid out of marrital assets. Same with you. \n\nJudge is going to invalidate your prenup for evicting him. You will likely get to keep your home ,but he is going to get a lot of your money. Same applies if its a woman who has less money, etc... Its not gender specific.\n\nYou should 100% speak to a divorce lawyer in your area before doing anything. If not, its near 100% certain your prenup will be thrown out over this. It won't mean its a 50/50 split of assets most likely, but your in trouble. Especially when he tells the judge you booted him out because he wanted his parents to not end up in a terrible nursing home. Yeah i know about the details, but his lawyer will twist that. \n\nPeople can get mad all they want over this comment since people almost always take the woman's side on this sub no matter. Same happens if its a man who owns the house with a prenup and there is a woman who has no ownership of the house. \n\nThis only applies to the US. if you are in another country, dunno.", "I was gonna say NTA but honestly the extra edit and your general 'this marriage can end, I don't care attitude'... I gotta opt for ESH. You gotta look out for your own, and he's asking way too much of you but changing your locks and putting his stuff in storage within 24h of a fight is a little dramatic.", "Your edit straight to talking about how much more you \"bring to the table\" says how closely you count the beans between you two. You have to separate, but it's not at all related to any of your parents. I hope your next spouse points out when he's got you over a barrel the same way you did to this one.", "ESH.\n\nIt's pretty clear that you think you're better than your husband and there was probably zero compromise on your part during any of your marriage.

Sounds like the two of you deserved each other.", "It\u2019s funny how some women work they own a house then they get married then divorced and they don\u2019t want to give men half their stuff but i bet if a man owned that house before marriage his ex wife would want half of everything and most likely she\u2019ll end up keeping that house", "YTA. Your in-laws deserve better than a nursing home. Be kind.", "YTA and a bad wife", "YTA, but don't worry, your future nursing home will have plenty of room for your parents.", "her prenup is going to be invalidated for an illegal eviction. you can't kick a spouse out of the marrital home. does not matter if there is a prenup or if she owns it. Also she can't force a lawyer on him. He can get a divorce lawyer and it will be paid by the marital funds. only exception is a restraining order due to violence. does not appear to be any here. \n\nFurther the lawyer will tell him, that he can get him back in the marital home until the divorce is settled by getting the police involved. the police will arrive at the house with him and they will demand he be let back in the house. it will be a lawful order. \n\nI don't know if its federal or state law that says this, but its true in every state in the US. It was initially created to protect women from a husband kicking them out, but it works for the husband too. She is going to have to pay a lot of money if she does this. \n\nShe needs to talk to the lawyer first or she is going to lose a lot of money in the divorce. may end up having to sell her house to pay him.", "This is reminiscent of the guy who was going to adopt his (special needs?) young sister, like 5 or 8 years old and expected his gf to do the lions-share of the caregiving. Same situation, she worked less hours/from home and he just expected it.  Later, it turned out that everyone in his life was praising him for taking her in and he enjoyed the adulation. \n\nThe gf disagreed with his unilateral decision and left his dumb ass.", "Excellent point. He thinks by moving his parents into her home (I\u2019m calling it her home since she is pursuing a divorce now), that he and his parents win. But his parents need more care than OP can provide.

A little of both.\n\nLooks like you look at everything as a $$$/ ownership decision.\n\nI think hubby has suddenly got lucky.", "OP is in no way the asshole for wanting a divorce over this. She has been treated poorly by people for 10 years and the entire family expects her to set herself on fire to keep them warm. \n\nI think it\u2019s bonkers you think the edit makes op the asshole. Why should op have a heart towards people who treated her badly for a literal decade, and now what her to fund not only her husband and his life but the abusive parents who need full time care, on top of her breadwinning job. It\u2019s no shame for the man to not be the breadwinner, but the way they have expected this of OP is insane. \n\nOp doesn\u2019t need to care about people who treated her badly their entire marriage. It would have hurt so badly to be constantly told that they wish he\u2019d married a good Chinese girl. OP was never good enough for them until they needed her house and money and caretaking experience", "I don't really see the issue. She has to be firm. She's also seemingly the one bringing everything to the table. \n\nIf the guy refuses to compromise then he's a bit dense because he's likely putting himself in a worse position. He's going to have to pay for his own place with enough space for his parents, find someone to take care of his parents while he's working, and be responsible for his parents when he's not working.\n\nThat's got to be frustrating to deal with someone like that.", "That was my opinion until I read this:\n>I told him if he decides to stay I\u2019ll respect his decision of not wanting my parents to move in, and I can look into other options for them.\n\nSo she offered her husband an out, but he wouldn't accept any other option than his parents and his alone.", "Holy shit it took me forever to find this post. 100% nailed the situation.

Yet you made sure to inform everyone he has a prenup over his head and that the house he\u2019s been in for 10 years isn\u2019t his. And that he contributed nothing?  I find that hard to believe. I wonder if this was a man posting about his wife if the reactions would be widely different. \n\nDoes he never help around the house?  Does he never help you?  Is he just a sponge that does nothing?", "It's both. She doesn't say where he/they are from in the post, but she mentions 'cultural' differences.

You now have divergent interests and you need to look out for yourself.\n\nGood luck.", "why dont you just leave him an ultimatum, that either he drops the topic because this is only your house and not his and you can invite anybody you want, especially if they are your parents, or you drop him as a husband if he cant let you have free will in things that are not doing something bad to anyone, and saying that you should do something because you are \u201ehis wife\u201d.

This should be so much higher. \n\nMy grandmother had Alzheimer\u2019s. It was early on-set and she had declined in her golden years so bad that by the time I was in my 20s, I\u2019m lucky she knew who I was. \n\nI recently shared a story about my grandmother flying home from Mexico with grandpa. They sat at the gate in the airport and missed their flight home. Anyone only noticed something was amiss when their bags arrived at baggage claim but grandma and grandpa did not. To make things worse, the airline said that grandpa, who was in his late 80s at that time himself, was her travel companion and that she would be fine and that if she had needed an airline companion she should have booked one. That floored me, like **did you seriously just say that to a panicked family member?** Ultimately the airline did find them and made sure they got on the plane. That was their last trip to Mexico. \n\nBut in the later stages of her Alzheimer\u2019s she got agitated easily, tore down all the family photos, and ultimately just sat around with no engagement. She also lost control over her bodily functions and was combative and completely refused to wear adult diapers. It robbed her of her dignity because she would soil herself and a lot of furniture because she couldn\u2019t remember to go use the bathroom. \n\nGrandpa adamantly refused to put them in a care facility or a care home. He was insistent he could take care of grandma. Until he couldn\u2019t. He had help. Burnt that bridge. and then when he realized that he, at 90-something years old, was not able to adequately care for her, they found a caregiver. Who was not a true caregiver in any sense of the word. \n\nYou still couldn\u2019t talk grandpa into a care facility. \n\nHe was forced to go into a care facility in the summer of 2021. He was fighting a losing battle of his own with dementia and had a rapid decline after his 101st birthday. We didn\u2019t want to do it but his new caregiver, a relative, had burnt herself out trying to care for him.

If she gets that bad, I'll do what I can to help, but she knows that what I can might well entail getting her into care.
