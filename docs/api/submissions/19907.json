That's not going to get better, it's only going to progress, and dementia patients need constant supervision. Unless one of you is willing to stay home to be a full time caregiver (and you can support four people on one income and two SS payments), she has to go into a facility specializing in dementia and Alzheimer's care. Even if you can afford 24/7 home health aides, at some point she will have to be moved. The more her disease progresses, the harder that transition will be. The most responsible, and the kindest, thing to do is to put her in the best facility you can afford long term.\n\nThen your husband should talk to your FIL. What does he want? Would he prefer to stay as close to his wife as possible? If he wants to see her everyday, then you're looking for a facility that can house them both. If FIL would rather not be in a facility (fair!), then you have to ask if your home can be reasonably made accessible for him. Ramps to get into the home, a first floor bedroom, a barrier free bathroom. If your home can't accommodate that, then you have to find other options for him. If your home could accommodate that with some remodeling, then you have the question of who pays for it and how that affects the prenup.\n\nOP, for now your parents are at the easy part of retirement. They don't need medical care, they're mobile, and living with you means saving against the day their living expenses rise. And it's your house. But also understand that your parents could downsize to more affordable housing near you and leave you both with some independence for several more years. Which of these do they want?\n\nNTA.

BS. \n\nMy mother, a RN, took care of my father the last years of his life-he had Alzheimer\u2019s. We, the kids, helped when we could. My mother never fully recovered physically or mentally, after his death. She simply was exhausted. \n\nFrom personal experience, no easy or even good answers for this. Good luck!", "NTA.

He fucking sucks for saying that you need to care for his unpleasant and highly needy parents because you\u2019re his wife. That\u2019s awful. You work full time. You can\u2019t also care for his parents. That\u2019s 2 full time jobs. How dare he ask that of you.

There is a big difference in the two scenarios that he doesn't seem to grasp. My husband and I actually discussed what would happen when our parents get to that point.  His mom has passed but we've decided - together- that his dad will go to a home (he is a hoarder and stubborn), we would be willing to move in with my parents if needed and would let my dad move in with us but not my mom as she's not good with boundaries.  My point being, each personality and situation is unique, and both of you need to be on the same page. If my husband said that I  HAD to do something, he'd be at the curb.", "NTA if you\u2019re unable to comfortably care for his parents that\u2019s kinda the end of it it\u2019s not fair of him to expect you to sacrifice like that. It\u2019s also very mature if you you respect his wishes if he also doesn\u2019t want your able parents to move in. It\u2019s a difficult situation you\u2019re in as wanting to care for one\u2019s parents is very understandable but it\u2019s not fair for one of you to have to shoulder the majority of the burden.

You don't say that your parents want to move in with you.\n\nThe other thing that I notice is that you make it real clear that you are the owner of the house. That, plus your willingness to have him move out to care for his parents suggests that your house isn't a stable situation for either set of parents.\n\nIt sounds like you need to consult with either a retirement specialist and/or a divorce lawyer.", "Who owns the house is not relevant here and should  not be used as a bargaining chip.\n\nI'd say  at this stage, NAH, although that could change if the  argument is allowed to stagnate. End of the day, you both have reasonable and understandable positions, and it's important to keep in mind that  neither  of you is operating  from a position of rationality here. Both of you have strong emotional positions, and  the arguments  that are being made here, on either side, are not necessarily  correct, they're things your brains have come up with to  try to justify the emotions, and just disproving those arguments doesn't change the underlying emotions, so it's not necessarily going  to  be a matter of which one of you is more correct.\n\nSpeaking personally though, I think  you're right that his parents are going to need to go into  a home, if not now then at some point. I have a good bit of experience with dementia, and there does come a point where they  just aren't safe to live alone, and full-time in-house care is practically never feasible. However, again bear in mind the emotions involved here. Everyone hates having to put their  parents in a home. You shouldn't be trying to \"win\" this, because if you do, you'll just foster  resentment. What your husband needs is support in what may well be the single  most stressful, most emotional decision of  his life  so far. You can assert that they won't be  living  with you, it's good to have that boundary, but you need to deal with that separately to the question of where your parents will live, because if you don't, he's probably going to see it as a competition where you're screwing his parents over for the sake of your own. Even if that's true, the real core of the issue should be  his  parents' health, and it'll help you to  keep the focus on that if you don't push on whether your parents will move in until  that's sorted. \n\nYou also may want to consider therapy  for yourself, him or both of you, separately or together, even if just to have some support and a way of working through emotions. There  are  dementia charities too that run helplines, and it can be worth talking to  those sorts of things to get more information and options.", "[deleted]", "ESH You can't pick and choose your family over your husband's. Both sets of parents should either not be in the house with you or they all come. I see you're willing to compromise, so you're less on the AH. He needs to think logically about this as well. If he wants his parents to move in, he can quit his job to become their paid live in nurse, and if your parents aren't too bad off may I suggest building them an in-law suite on your land. That way, they have their own space, and you can go visit them in the back if the in laws are getting ornery.", "NTA - tell him it\u2019s your house and you\u2019ll make the call.

Im sure it's no secret that you don't have a great relationship with them either? You have every right to say you don't want them to live with you.  \n\nHowever,  your husband has every right to not want extra guests as well.

When my grandma had to spend a lot of time in the hospital when I was younger, I spent days there at a time when my mom and aunt couldn\u2019t be off work, because they couldn\u2019t deal with the idea of her being there without someone. Same for when she had to be in a nursing home. With all the stories about nursing home abuse, I can\u2019t blame him for not liking the idea. He isn\u2019t the asshole for wanting them to move in with family where he can feel they\u2019ll be well taken care of. The asshole territory comes in when he has a problem with the person who would be responsible for most of the care says no.", "Pretty sure I never said anything implying it wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s the asshole for expecting her to provide constant care while working (assuming they actually require that level of care. It could just be they need someone around in case of emergency rather than constant supervision, but that\u2019s really irrelevant). But the previous poster says he brings nothing to the table because he\u2019s not working from home and willing to care for them. I was pointing out that is very rarely an option and has nothing to do with what he may or may not bring to the table.", "OP said its a hospital admin job that is seen as a cushy semi retirement option for nurses who also have another degree."]}
