My bf's sister (F22- lets call her Katie) started a course in September and has gone from earning a decent salary of \u00a32k to \u00a3600+ a month. Katie has been wanting to do this course for over a year, so has had plenty of time to save up, but she hasn't. \n\nThe thing is, is that Katie did not anticipate the financial challenges she would face, even though she was made very much aware by everyone in the house. Within the year of her deciding that she was going back to education, she has brought the following: \n\n\\- Financed a new car (+\u00a3200 a month)\n\n\\- Signed onto a gym membership for 12 months which she cannot get out of (\u00a360 a month)\n\n\\- Brought herself a new iphone on finance (\u00a350 a month) \n\n\\- Brought everything on Klarna like concert tickets and is still paying it off (she's currently paying \u00a340 a month). Again, she was made fully aware of the dangers of Klarna but ignored all the advice.\n\nAlso, even though she has no money, she always comes home with tat like new mugs, cookie cutters, cushions etc. and always goes out for lunch. Another example is that it was her birthday early this month, where she got +\u00a3200 which was spent on primark tat... which again after it was all spent, she complained how she had no money. If i was struggling that much, I would have used that money to help me through the month...\n\nLast August, we had a house meeting about the changes in the house, with the understanding that Katie was changing from full time to part time work, we all decided that we would all increase our rent and Katie's rent would be halved. The issue occured when Katie settled for a 18 hour contract (not enough to cover all her outgoings (she knew this)) and to make it worse, her work has not been fulfilling these hours and she has not raised this with her boss. She also doesn't want to work on Saturdays (her works busiest day) and limits herself to only 3 days a week, but sometimes she literally only has 4 hour shifts. \n\nNow, everytime we do anything such as my bf and I ordering a takeaway, Katie will make a comment on how she can't afford it just make a massive deal over not being able to have anything. If i mention any sort of money in the house, the topic is instantly changes to how we should feel sorry for Katie. Literally everything is about how we should be supporting Katie. My bf's mum even had the cheek to say that i should get a saturday job so i could pay more rent (i work full time).\n\nSo, AITA for not feeling sorry for Katie at all? I have seen this coming since the day she declared that she wanted to go back into education. I even discussed this with my bf and he was concerned about the same thing, even so, he had quite a few conversations with katie to make her aware of what she was getting herself into.

Not your problem, but hers.", "NTA - suggesting you work more to support the sister is kind of an insult. \n\nMaybe you and your bf, finding a roommate and moving out might be a good idea. You signed up to date him, not to support his family, not to be taken advantage of by them.  You\u2019re already paying extra rent to help her and that\u2019s kind enough. \n\nThis is a bit of a warning sign since I notice you didn\u2019t mention what your bf thought about this in general or what his mom said about you getting extra hours to help the sister.\n\nGoing forward, ignore her comments and suggest she work on Saturdays or take extra hours. Talk to your bf about this and how you are feeling a little used.", "NTA, I would suggest making it known that if you\u2019re expected to pay more rent you\u2019ll be saving up to leave as this will actually end up saving you money - you\u2019ll probably find they suddenly decide the rent you pay is enough", "NTA.

You say they need your rent. So Let them know that due to the fact that you\u2019re basically being asked to support Katie with her irresponsible spending because of increased requests for money, that the two of you will be looking for other housing.  \n\nIf they want you to remain in the house you will continue to give the agreed upon amount but you will not be buying her food or anything else.  And when her program ends in the normal length of the course (make sure you know how long it takes so she doesn\u2019t stretch it out) you will be paying the old amount where it is split evenly. \n\nIf she needs more money, she will have to figure out how to get it, which would mean she has to work Saturdays or what not."]}
