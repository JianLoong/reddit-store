{"id": 10718, "submission_id": "11a21xw", "title": "AITA For Asking My Friend For a Piece of Chocolate?", "selftext": "I (34F) am the manager of a small retail store. Today is my day off, but I went into the store to make sure everything was set to run smoothly, as we have two new hires. When I got there, my friend/employee Kate (21F) was in the back showing the other workers some chocolate she got from her boyfriend. They were apparently some fancy gourmet dark chocolate truffles in a little box and she was showing off the last one. She said she\u2019d eaten the others since they\u2019d come in last Friday (a late second Valentine\u2019s Day gift apparently) and meant to eat the last one last night, but had forgotten. Here\u2019s where the issue arises.\n\nI asked Kate if I could try it. She looked surprised by the question and took a minute before she answered it. She told me I could buy some on the website and that she had the little pamphlet that came with the box showing all the flavors available. She asked if I\u2019d like it, and I told her yes, but that I\u2019d like to try the chocolate to see if it\u2019s any good. She said her boyfriend got them for her and she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be right to give her gift to someone else. I laughed and told her in a lighthearted tone that if she wants to be stingy she can just say that. A couple of the others laughed, but I guess Kate didn\u2019t find it funny. She just stood there and didn\u2019t say anything, which is really unlike her. She\u2019s very talkative and bubbly. She ended up closing the box of chocolate and said something about forgetting to do something and left the room. \n\nI ended up leaving the building about twenty minutes later, and then another hour later I got a text from my assistant manager Marla (47F) saying Kate asked to leave early because she didn\u2019t feel well. I approved through my DM for her to leave since we were staffed well enough for what would probably be a slow day. I asked her to pass along to Kate that if she leaves, I\u2019d like for her to make up for those hours at some point in the next week. Otherwise, she\u2019s good to go. I tried asking Marla what was wrong, but all she knew to tell me was that Kate wasn\u2019t feeling well, as she said. She proposed it could have something to do with what I said earlier, though, as she\u2019d allegedly been quiet since then. Now I\u2019m just wondering, am I the asshole? Or an asshole at all?\n\nEdit- Autocorrect attacked when I wrote my response to the bot. It should read \u201cI may be\u201d at the beginning. Also, just to clarify, I was only asking for part of the truffle, not the whole thing. I only wanted a nibble.\n\nEdit- Everyone seems to be misunderstanding me about the making up hours thing. I don\u2019t expect Kate to make up those hours and I\u2019m not demanding her to. When I said \u201cotherwise, she\u2019s good to go\u201d that meant that her making up her hours was just my only note/suggestion. Kate was free to leave early regardless of if she makes up her hours. She\u2019s one of my best and most reliable workers and pulls overtime quite often, so I never enforce policy about \u201cmaking up\u201d hours on her. This is also the second time she\u2019s left early since I hired her almost five months ago, and she\u2019s only requested time off twice.

How can you not see this? \n\nYou asked a subordinate for something that belonged to them. She said no, and you persisted. I'm surprised you didn't threaten her with unpaid overtime.", "YTA and especially YTA for \"only wanting a nibble\". So you wanted to eat part of the chocolate and then...give the rest back? Gross. Even if you meant break it in half with your hands, that wasn't clear in what you said, and it was a romantic gift from her boyfriend, not some random chocolate she happened to have with her.", "YTA- it was her gift, the last one and why would you feel so entitled to it? It's not yours and anyone with any sense of manners would never ask someone else for their last piece of chocolate, especially if jt was a gift. Also you're her boss that makes this 10x more uncomfortable for her- apologise and go buy the chocolates yourself and give her one to make up for your obnoxiousness. Also just a nibble doesn't make it any better.", "YTA and sound like a pretty bad manager. \n\n1. The chocolate wasn't for you, it was Kate's and it seems to be nice / expensive stuff from Valentines. It was rude and awkward for you to ask like you were entitled for it. \n2. Making employees make up hours later is standard shitty retail 101. As a manager and leader myself, that practice is so antiquated and honestly embarrassing.", "EWWWW YOUR EDIT\n\nSo you came in on your day off, wanted to chew on your employee\u2019s LAST VALENTINE\u2019S DAY TRUFFLE and then GIVE IT BACK TO HER, and need to hear from strangers on the internet whether you\u2019re TA?\n\nFine, YTA", "YTA. What the hell? The audacity of you to ask for her last Valentine chocolate.", "YTA - it was her LAST piece of chocolate? Dude wtf why would you ask for that? And then call her STINGY when she didn't want to share?\n\nGet over yourself", "You wanted your employee Kate's chocolate, she said no, so as her manager you mocked her in front of everyone?\n\nThen she wanted to leave because obviously she wasn't feeling welcomed by you or the others who laughed at her, and your response is she has to make up her hours, even though the day is covered by enough staff?\n\nWhat is wrong with you? How you're a manager of anything and haven't been fired with an attitude like yours is outstanding. \n\nYTA, grow up and treat people better.", "It is her Valentine\u2019s Day gift. She is not stingy for not wanting to give you any. As her boss, you should not making those kinds of comments to a subordinate.", "YTA.  You used your position of power to intimidate your underling into giving you a piece of their property.  They were clearly uncomfortable and you kept doing it anyway.  Then you led the whole team in a nice round of public bullying.  Talk about a hostile workplace.\n\nThe good news is she sounds like Marla will be a nice supportive witness for her HR complaint.\n\nNever put yourself in a position to take from an underling.

The \"lighthearted\" comments were also unnecessary. She said it was a gift and even suggested you get some yourself, that should've sufficed as an answer.\n\nAlso, I think its evident that shes your employee, not your friend.", "YTA. You asked, then chastised, then ignored the obvious answer. I want to try yours before I buy.. What is that? Wait for an offer.\n It is doubly bad because you are not her friend, no matter how much you want to think so. You are her supervisor, you will always have a power imbalance between you two. \"Joking\" from you will always have an element of a threat. She can't really joke back because if you get offended it affects her job.", "Wow. Just . . . wow.\n\n**YTA**\n\nAnd I'm honestly wondering how you managed to get a managerial position because it sounds like you have absolutely no social skills whatsoever (and that's pretty bad coming from me, a literal autistic person). And let me tell you, your edit just makes it SO MUCH WORSE.\n\nFirst of all you didn't \"ask your friend for a piece of chocolate\". You asked your EMPLOYEE, over whom you have significant authority, and who is also significantly younger than you. You may be friendLY with her, but she is not your friend. There is a massive power imbalance, and it's incredibly difficult for her to say no to you without fearing for her employment. So what you did was super inappropriate right off the bat. But then . . .\n\nSecondly, you didn't just ask her \"for a piece of chocolate\". You asked her to give you THE VERY LAST, VERY EXPENSIVE, FANCY CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE THAT WAS A GIFT FROM HER BOYFRIEND. What is wrong with you? Why would she give you the last of a special gift to her from her partner? And even after she very politely said no (probably scared shitless that you'd use it against her in her job), you were then rude to her, called her \"selfish\", implying that she had done something wrong or inappropriate? Talk about abusing your authority! You were the only greedy one here! Again, you don't get to demand that your employees share their personal things with you. It's literally illegal in a lot of places to make demands like that.\n\nAnd finally, your edit is HORRIFYING. You \"just wanted a bite\"? Lady, we're still in the middle of a tripledemic, and even if we weren't, you're not a toddler and she's not your mom. No one wants to eat the rest of a piece of chocolate THAT YOU'VE BITTEN INTO ALREADY. Ew. \n\nI don't know if you were raised under a rock (or a troll bridge) or what, but you owe her a massive apology. You were super inappropriate, and if I were your employee I'd be making a complaint to HR or the store owners. YTA, and shockingly poorly socialised.", "YtA. \n\nYou're a manager pressuring someone that works for you and is younger than you to give you her property. When she said no, you still keep pressuring her.\n\nSaying you did this in a \"light hearted\" way does not negate the fact that you did something very unfair and mean to a young coworker.\n\nYtA", "YTA who tries to take the last piece of someone else's food?", "YTA\n1. It\u2019s a gift for her. It\u2019s up to her if she wants to share that or not, not you\n2. It\u2019s the last bit she has, why the heck would you ask for the last bit (of her gift, honestly any food item) someone has?\n3. Despite her telling you no, you pressed the matter then insult her and call her stingy\n4. You\u2019re in a position of power over her\n\nHow can you not see that you\u2019re rude and a total A H.", "You asked her for her last chocolate, she even tried to tell you where it was bought but you still insisted on having hers. That's very tone deaf, very weird and impolite. Maybe you can salvage the situation by saying you were kidding? Idk, but yes you are the AH, maybe if she still had a lot of them would be ok, but the normal thing to do it's to wait for the person to offer, if they don't offer, don't ask.", "YTA, I would have laughed at your stingy comment and then politely told you that your entitlement is out of control. She was proud of her gift and showing it off, and then you asked for the very last piece.", "YTA and you know it. She isn't your friend- she is your employee. You just wanted a nibble? Ewww. She didn't want to eat after you!  You thought being her boss was enough to score you that expensive truffle.", "YTA. \n\n> fancy gourmet dark chocolate truffles in a little box and she was showing off the last one. \n\nYou knew these were special, expensive, and that the box was small. Also that there was only one left. Did you think that she was going to let you take a bite out of *her* last piece?", "You are 34 years old, surely you have picked up that it is rude to ask for someone to share a special gift by now? Even if not, you are Kate's BOSS so there is an inherent balance of power in play so telling you no is uncomfortable and likely caused her to worry about her employment. \n\nYes, obviously YTA. You behaved like a child and then insulted the person who you were demanding to share their food with you.", "YTA\u2026 You are absolutely TA. The fact you even think you aren\u2019t is ridiculous. You never ask someone for their last or a gift and you asked for both in one go and thought calling her stingy was acceptable. You were acting entitled\u2026 She wasn\u2019t mean or ungenerous.", "YTA  it was her gift not yours. unless she actually offered you to try it its pretty rude to want the last piece of her gift", "YTA for calling her stingy. She had every right to say no.", "You called her stingy for not giving you her last piece of chocolate\nOf course YTA", "YTA- they were her gift. It was  an AH move to ask at first, it was incredibly an AH move to keep pressing and make a \"joke\" to pressure her. This is especially true when you're her manager at work.", "YTA She tried to kindly tell you no, and you called her stingy. You're rude.\n\nRemember you're a manager. You are in a position of power and authority over the workers. Don't abuse it and hold yourself to a higher standard next time. You should be more thoughtful of how you interact with your employees. You set the vibe for the whole store, for their whole work day! \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if she starts looking for a new job.", "Nobody takes a nibble of a truffle. What was she supposed to do with the rest of it, eat around your nibble? YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou called her stingy for not wanting to give you the last of her Valentine's Day chocolates from her boyfriend? I mean, frankly it was a dick move to ask for a piece of her gift to begin with (and since when are chocolate truffles something shareable? like... were you planning on cutting it in half with a fork and knife?) but then you doubled down to pressure her into it and make your stupid little \"joke\" which was absolutely not a joke at all. Then you have to take into account the power differential (age difference, your very different positions at work where she's a subordinate to you)... this was just SO inappropriate. Go buy your own chocolate.", "YTA. You're her manager, putting pressure on her to share part of a gift she received. Do better.", "YTA.  You are her superior and asked in front of others that she give you something that was hers.  Additionally, it sounds like she only had one left and was saving it.  When she offered you where to get it from, you then insisted she give you it to try because you wanted to know if you liked it.  You then insulted and mocked her for saying no to you.  As her boss, you need to realize that the power dynamic made your actions 100% worse.  You should go online and buy her a variety of those chocolates as and apologize to her for your inappropriate and unprofessional behavior.", "YTA twice. First for trying to pressure her into letting you eat her fancy chocolate that was almost gone - you're her boss and there's a power imbalance there- and second for saying she needs to makeup the hours if she goes home sick.", "YTA. Why is it her problem you\u2019d like to try before you buy\u2026", "YTA and I hope your company has a HR department so she can report you. You tried to use your position over her to shame her & to force her into giving you something that was hers. You need to be written up for intimidation of a subordinate.", "YTA it was pretty trashy to put her on the spot and ask for what you knew was her last valentines chocolate", "YTA-  she said no and you insulted her.  Not cool.", "YTA and rude.  They were her gift and she was showing them not sharing them.  Her saying no doesnt make her an AH or stingy but you calling her stingy when you can buy your own makes you one,  It was her last one and she was looking forward to it.  That was very rude.", "Even weirder that you wanted a nibble - what was she going to do with the rest of truffle you nibbled on? YTA", "YTA. That was tacky as all heck. \n\nPlus calling her stingy with Her gift, when it was you standing there greedily demanding and trying to pressure her into giving her boyfriends Valentines gift to you?  And you are in a position of power over her in your work? \nYou are so So much the Asshole.\n\nYou owe her a Public apology.", "YTA first off for what you did and how you did it. Because you asked, she answered and \"no\" is a complete sentence. \n\nYTA a second time because as a manager, you should know better.\n\nYTA AGAIN because your comments make it clear that you came here looking for support and you're salty because you're not getting any.\n\nYTA THE FOURTH TIME because you're unwilling to entertain any input that suggests you were, in fact, in the wrong here, and therefore, unwilling to acknowledge,  let alone change your behavior.\n\nThis is the first hat-trick plus of AHery I've seen in a while. Thanks", "Yeah, YTA. General rule of thumb I have always gone by\u2026.the buyer or receiver of the food gets the first and the last bite of it. Especially a romantic gift, I don\u2019t even ask and double check if they offer. She was not being stingy. You were using your title or \u2018friend\u2019 to act entitled and undermine her position in front of two new employees who she now needs to gain ground back with. \n\nSo good job, you just told your new employees that they don\u2019t need to take her seriously. I am sure it will be very helpful moving forward. /s", "YTA\n\nNo questions asked, you are her manager and you are putting her in a situation where she is supposed to give you the last piece of chocolate she got from her boyfriend to you? It would be a different situation if she was giving the other ones a piece as well, but it was the last one and she got it as a gift, not you. You are so horrible for putting her in this kind of position.", "YTA. The last one that she had - and you asked in front of everyone for part of it. Not cool. And when she purposely tried to deflect you, you called her stingy. Jerk move.", "How you got promoted into a position of authority when you clearly lack all the necessary social skills to lead people is beyond me. Yes, YTA; for asking anyone for their last piece of anything, especially their special Valentine's candy; for pressuring someone when they tried to very politely say no; for calling them names when they stood up for themselves and said 'no' again; for refusing to realize she was upset, even though you clearly observed the social cues that she was. You owe her an apology as public as the incident was.", "YTA. If she offers you chocolate, fine. But asking to \"try a nibble\" of the last one she had? Ugh, that's so gross to me. She was clearly uncomfortable and tried to be nice about it, and you kept pushing.", "YTA It was an inappropriate ask in the first place-- and you kept asking (bullying) after she said no and made her and the other's uncomfortable.  This is worse because you are her boss.  Do you have problems with social interactions and cues on a regular basis?  You own Katie an apology for going too far and giving your odd behavior might be why she went home I'd go the extra mile and waive her having to make up the extra time.", "Maybe you should stop being stingy and buy your own chocolate :) YTA!", "A nibble? Ew...  Are you sure you're in your thirties????  YTA.", "YTA. That was inappropriate even if she was not someone you manage. Your edit does not help- you wanted a nibble off her chocolate? Gross!", "YTA - You asked for her last chocolate, she politely declined, you insulted her, she went home not feeling and all you could think of was making sure she made up the time.  Your behavior as a boss is unacceptable and just downright selfish. You bullied her", "YTA not only asking her for the last piece of chocolate but then telling her she has to make up hours next week\u2026 what is the point of that? You are a huge AH", "YTA Going into the store when you aren't even working and badgering staff for their property? The chocolate is hers, she doesn't have to share if she doesn't want to. I'm teaching my 2 year old this shit ffs. If someone came you to you and said 'let me try your sandwich' and you say no, are you being stingy? The entitlement is strong in this one", "YTA\n\nIt's not really asking a friend for a piece of chocolate.\n\nYou went into work on your day off and tried to brow beat one of your staff into giving you a gift she received from her boyfriend in front of other employees.\n\nThis could even be construed as bullying and harassment.\n\nYou owe her a massive apology", "YTA.  There is no 'part' of a truffle.  She wasn't offering to share her chocolates, just sharing the info about her gift.  When she said 'No, ' that should have been it, but then you doubled down and that is always AH territory.  Apologize and maybe, if you really feel guilty, buy her some of the chocolates as a real apology for your entitledness.", "YTA\n\nYou literally called her stingy for not letting you have some of the last piece of her present. It's not like she had a bunch extra literally her last piece of something that came in multiple flavors so we don't even know if she got to try that one yet. Just asking in and of itself could be a social faux pas knowing it's the last one but to basically insist after she gave a clear no and reason why is extra rude.\n\n\n  You also don't seem to realize the power imbalance of your \u201cfriendship\u201d. It's very uncomfortable to make those kinds of \u201cjokes\u201d to someone you have managerial authority over and can amount to undue pressure to do what you asked. It's not light-hearted at all", "YTA - a truffle is not something that you can nibble\non and it was rude to push the issue with her last one.", "YTA. You are the reason she didn\u2019t feel well and left early. You made her miserable over not sharing a personal gift. You crossed a line.", "Holy entitlement batman...", "YTA and when she showed there was only one left it should have been a red flag not to ask for it!", "YTA. Taking advantage of your position and just expected it being okay makes you TA here. It\u2019s her personal chocolate gift. If she would have offered, no issue at all. But it crossed a line twice, (1) to expect her sharing it with her manager and (2) not realising what your comment caused for her when she refused.", "YTA. Rude for asking in the first place but then asking to take the last one??  Come on.", "Yta how rude if she didn't offer you don't ask. You made fun of her and joined in while others laughed. Gross behaviour for someone yr age. Mean and rude.", "Uh, yes YTA. You are in a power imbalance. You asked, which you shouldn\u2019t have done in the first place after hearing she was saving them, and she felt comfortable enough to say no. You continued to nag, which made her feel awkward enough to remove herself from the situation, and then you CONTINUED to be a jerk when she wanted to leave early. Your behavior at the end, while not necessarily retaliation, could easily read as such.", "YTA and your employees are not your friends. You clearly showed how you put her in a bad position as her BOSS making an unreasonable personal ask. And you don\u2019t ask to eat the LAST chocolate that was a gift to someone else, regardless of your relationship.", "You are absolutely TA. It would have been poor form to ask for one of the truffles if she had a full box, for crying out loud! But to ask for a \u201cnibble\u201d of her last piece? I mean, come on!

You rudely asked for the last piece of her expensive gift (and if, as you say in your edit you only wanted a \u201cnibble\u201d that\u2019s gross, and far worse). She politely said no and you continued to pressure her several more times. YTA. A huge, entitled one.", "YTA It's not 'stingy' to give someone a part of their food. You didn't ask her for 'a piece of chocolate' you asked to have 'a nibble' of her last very expensive gifted truffle. You belittled her in front of other staff, pretty sure that counts as bullying. It's rude and presumptious of you. Buy your own damn chocolates.", "YTA. Asking for the last bite of a friend's expensive Valentine's Day chocolate would be an asshole move in and of itself. But that wasn't what happened. You attempted to browbeat a subordinate into giving you one of her possessions. And then when she declined (repeatedly, I might add), you insulted her in front of her coworkers. That's shockingly inappropriate and I hope you are reported and get written up. You have made a toxic work environment.", "YTA What? Who asks for someone\u2019s last piece of\u2026 anything? Especially when it\u2019s expensive and a gift? And then call them stingy for saying no, even jokingly?", "YTA. It was her Valentine\u2019s Day gift from her BF not just some chocolate that she bought. And regardless she has no obligation to give you her expensive chocolate. Calling her stingy for not wanting to give it to you is a total AH move. Also you mention it was the last piece in a small box, why on earth would you feel entitled to it?", "YTA.\n\nYour presence intimidated her. Although it was your day off, you\u2019re still her superior. You should\u2019ve stuck to your original plan, which was making sure the store was running smoothly with the new hires. At no point should you have turned it into a mingling session.\n\nMingling or not, you should always respect someone\u2019s answer to you asking for something. Kate didn\u2019t flat out say \u201cno\u201d but her explaining how to purchase the chocolate on your own was enough to tell us she didn\u2019t want to share. After all, she was showing the chocolates off to your other colleagues. Not sharing with them. Letting you try would\u2019ve prompted her to do the same with others; it\u2019s one of the reasons why kids never make it known they have chewing gum on them in school.", "Why don\u2019t you ask your own partner to get the chocolate for you \ud83d\udc40\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence. Just because you're a manager doesn't mean you get to bully your employees. \n\nAlso it's ridiculous you're expecting her to make up her hours. I worked in retail and if I went home sick and we were fine staff wise, I wasn't expected to make up those hours later.", "YTA. if you're someone's boss and you ask them for something that is not their work at the work place you are always putting them in an awkward position every time. Obviously no one wants to share their valentines gift with their boss. Obviously.", "YTA. You knew it was the last one yet still asked for it. You have no idea how valuable the last of any food can be for some people.   \n\n\nAlso...you can't nibble a truffle. Gross.", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t have acted this way when I was a manager at 23.

Today is my day off, but I went into the store to make sure everything was set to run smoothly, as we have two new hires. When I got there, my friend/employee Kate (21F) was in the back showing the other workers some chocolate she got from her boyfriend. They were apparently some fancy gourmet dark chocolate truffles in a little box and she was showing off the last one. She said she\u2019d eaten the others since they\u2019d come in last Friday (a late second Valentine\u2019s Day gift apparently) and meant to eat the last one last night, but had forgotten. Here\u2019s where the issue arises.\n\nI asked Kate if I could try it. She looked surprised by the question and took a minute before she answered it. She told me I could buy some on the website and that she had the little pamphlet that came with the box showing all the flavors available. She asked if I\u2019d like it, and I told her yes, but that I\u2019d like to try the chocolate to see if it\u2019s any good. She said her boyfriend got them for her and she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be right to give her gift to someone else. I laughed and told her in a lighthearted tone that if she wants to be stingy she can just say that. A couple of the others laughed, but I guess Kate didn\u2019t find it funny. She just stood there and didn\u2019t say anything, which is really unlike her. She\u2019s very talkative and bubbly. She ended up closing the box of chocolate and said something about forgetting to do something and left the room. \n\nI ended up leaving the building about twenty minutes later, and then another hour later I got a text from my assistant manager Marla (47F) saying Kate asked to leave early because she didn\u2019t feel well. I approved through my DM for her to leave since we were staffed well enough for what would probably be a slow day. I asked her to pass along to Kate that if she leaves, I\u2019d like for her to make up for those hours at some point in the next week. Otherwise, she\u2019s good to go. I tried asking Marla what was wrong, but all she knew to tell me was that Kate wasn\u2019t feeling well, as she said. She proposed it could have something to do with what I said earlier, though, as she\u2019d allegedly been quiet since then. Now I\u2019m just wondering, am I the asshole? Or an asshole at all?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're supposed to be an adult.", "YTA. Who the hell asks to eat the LAST of any food? That\u2019s just rude. On top of that, it was clearly expensive. it\u2019s obvious she didn\u2019t want to share even by your telling,and you pushed it.", "YTA\n\nBut that's also not something that should be so upsetting Kate needed to leave early.", "YTA\n\nIt was her last piece, from a gift she had received from her partner, and you asked for it? Yeah, that\u2019s utterly tactless. She was just being happy about getting a present, not passing the box around for everyone.\n\nTo make it worse, you\u2019re in a position of authority over her, so those kinds of requests may easily be seen as abuse of the power dynamic between you.\n\nYou need to learn appropriate boundaries and the difference between friends and employees you\u2019re friendly with. May I recommend reading Ask A Manager for a while?", "YTA. Asking was fine, joking about her being stingy with something that has an emotional connection to her is a bit much. When was the last time your partner gave away their Valentine gift?", "YTA! You tried to use your authority to bully her.", "Yta. If she wanted to share she\u2019d have offered it on her own.

And talk about a double down, to say she is stingy. You are her Manager be better.\n\nAnd quit going into work on your day off with the excuse of making sure all is smooth.

Real retail manager behavior.", "YTA. There are so many red flags here! First of all, Kate is not your \u201cfriend/employee,\u201d she is your subordinate and your employee. You\u2019re not friends. Second of all, it\u2019s incredibly rude to ask someone for the last piece of anything, let alone a Valentine\u2019s Day gift from their partner. Third of all, it\u2019s even more inappropriate to ask for a *nibble* out of someone\u2019s last piece of something! If one of your employees was eating a piece of pizza would you ask to take a bite because you want to try it? \n\nYou are the boss and therefore it\u2019s totally inappropriate for you to ask your employees for gifts they can\u2019t confidently say no to. Gifts in a workplaces should only flow down. If you want to buy candy for your staff, you\u2019re welcome to do so. But they should never be asked to give their boss anything.", "YTA. Not because you asked for the chocolate, but because she said no and then you mocked her for it, and you did that in front of her coworkers. Unprofessional at every opportunity.", "YTA.  \n\n\nStep one, don't go to work on your day off to check up on people. That's annoying, and only tells employees that you don't trust them. It only breeds a negative work environment.\n\nStep two, don't ask to sample from a gift. If it is offered, fine, but don't ask. That's Basic Etiquette 101. ESPECIALLY when it's the very last one. Because now, not only are you eating the last one, your other employees get nothing. That's extremely discourteous.\n\nStep three, when a \"no\" is uttered, that's where you stop. I don't know if a \"no\" was actually said here, but it would take someone of especially thick cranial thickness to not get the hint.

Now, if you were really slow and you sent her home to save money, could she demand to work those additional hours next week?", "You are not Kate's friend. You are her boss.

She probably would\u2019ve told you to fuck off if you were another employee, except you\u2019re her manager, and she tried politely to say no and you called her stingy. She\u2019s probably worried that you\u2019re going to take it out on her professionally. Again, you are not friends", "YTA.

No one will ever see me leaving work early unless someone close dies or I'm literally shitting myself.\n\nYou're dealing with spoiled entitled children at work and you're asking spoiled entitled children for their opinion.", "YTA.\n\nPlease, use this to become better. Don't just get pissed that you've done wrong. You should definitely apologize, and if she asks to speak about this to your own boss, you should accept it with grace. I don't think you deserve to lose your job, but this is one of those moments you can use the change how you see things. \n\nI think you have an entitlement problem.

Learn your role and stick to it.", "The work environment is a delicate thing it\u2019s very difficult to balance friend/manager in your case. So it\u2019s easy to see why there would be some discomfort in this situation. You\u2019re older than her by 13 years so almost no room to relate to her. You just come off as an AH, she already tried to decline politely by saying you can buy some and she can give you the pamphlet but nope you gotta keep pushing and respectfully tells you she doesn\u2019t feel right giving you her chocolates since they were gift meant for her and not for sharing. AGAIN you try to make one last attempt at trying to get a NIBBLE from her chocolates by joking about her being stingy. Nah you\u2019re a A tier asshole.

Look in my opinion you're not necessarily the AH for asking for the chocolate (even though you obviously weren't thinking because it's pretty rude at the very least). The major problem is that a subordinate told you no and you ridiculed them in front of everyone. You're a manager. Due to the power imbalance you should be the one setting the example. This means you're not allowed to insult your employees.

OP is still firmly in the wrong to see that she didn't have enough to share and asking anyway (and so gross for thinking \"nibbling\" half off would be fine).", "Ha! I just noticed that. Still super weird tho.", "Especially with OP being in a position above her. Like even asking is inappropriate because it's difficult to say no. \n\nI've been in management and friendly with those I managed, but you have to have a delicate balance and realize they can feel pressured to stay in your good favor, so don't even put them in a position like that.", "Idk I personally think it\u2019s very rude to ask someone who is not a CLOSE friend for a bite of their food.  If they OFFER, sure, but otherwise just keep your mouth shut.  If no offer is extended, they don\u2019t want to share and that is A-OK."]}
