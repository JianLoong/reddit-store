In some cultures, there are some items that are viewed as so sacred, for someone who's not a member of that culture (and often only a specific person within that culture, like a religious figure) to use it is considered appropriation because you cannot be treating it respectfully if you'd wear it like that. An example is a Native American war bonnet (the feathered headdress), which signifies bravery and is an honor bestowed upon them only through formal recognition by the rest of their community. These communities have made it clear that seeing someone who's not a member of a First Nations tribe wearing one as a costume is necessarily disrespectful because they're taking an item of great significance and treating it like it's not important. That's cultural appropriation. \n\nContrast that with a kimono: While a country isn't a monolith, many different Japanese organizations and cultural groups have made it clear that they actually encourage foreigners who are interested in the culture to wear kimonos, if they're doing so to show appreciation for Japanese culture.

I mean, do you live in Japan, and your ancestors also lived in Japan? If not, you have no right to decide on if adopting a particular aspect of Japanese culture because you like it is cultural appropriation", "We didn\u2019t need to know your race buddy lol. You could have just not left a comment.", " I've met consider it a compliment when you wear their cultural clothes.", "Are you referring to [the Kimono Protest at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts?](https://hyperallergic.com/223047/the-confused-thinking-behind-the-kimono-protests-at-the-boston-museum-of-fine-arts/)\n\nBecause the context there is a bit different.

There's the type you're referring to, where there is something that comes from minority cultures, something that they're maybe even excited and willing to share outside of their own culture, that gets repackaged by corporations and leaves the people who actually created it with no profit or income. In those cases, it's not so much that you can't ever engage with that thing, it's just that to do so ethically, you should do what you described: Go to members of that community and buy locally, both to support them and to help avoid the other type of cultural appropriation, where people from outside a culture use things that members of the culture have specifically requested should only stay within the culture.\n\nSo, yeah, the second type is where a group has said 'this thing we've created is sacred to us, please don't use it if you aren't a member of our group' and then it gets used anyways. What always comes to mind for me is the war bonnet, which many First Nations communities have said has deep cultural significance and not only should only be worn by members of their communities, but only by members who have received specific recognition within their communities... And you still see it in Halloween costumes every year.", "I bet you looked great!", "Yeah I also remember seeing a video of a guy wearing a sterotypical mexican costume and asking both non mexian and mexican people what they though or if it was offensive. Non mexican said that it was offensive while mexican liked it. People should stop being offended in the name of others.", "Any of the Irish people I know seem to be perfectly happy to celebrate along with the rest of the world. I used to go to an Irish pub and just loved the music and how someone always produced some spoons to play along. They all welcomed me and encouraged me to join in the fun.\n\nI came from a German community and once again, we Germans were all happy to celebrate our heritage with the thousands of visitors at Oktoberfest. It is my heritage but I would not object to seeing my husband in a pair of lederhosen. :)\n\nThe majority of people are proud of their heritage and are happy to share, if only for one day a year.", "Cultural Appropriation is something ppl say, when they don't have a clue of what their talking about", "> Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston\n\nThe only thing I've seen there is a climate change protest.", " Sounds like a bunch of people wanting to be mad for the sake of it.", "They even looked for colors and patterns they thought we would like!", "This might be unpopular, but many of the people engaging in it aren't really white as in of European ancestry. Many of the protests had various minorities/were lead by them that were entirely unrelated to whatever culture was being celebrated. Yet seemed to lay claim to it solely based on a shared \"not whiteness\".", "BIPOC is stupid. It's basically ranking minorities by oppression. A lot of people have been claiming that Asians are \"basically white,\" and as an racially ambiguous Hispanic who's been mistaken as Asian a lot, I've heard it to my face too.", "I'd argue it never really went away, just looking at the US from the outside. You guys are just fighting about who's the most oppressed/special and thus deserves the most benefits, preferrential treatment, etc now.", "I'm not from the US, I find the US to be bewildering and strange in terms of all the politics and vocal groups you guys have going on.", "It also seems they're often guilty about it themselves, as they're laying claim broadly to some made up collective group's supposed culture that doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not from the US, so I find it bewildering to see other minorities living in the US proclaim some kind of \"BIPOC\" collective culture. Ignoring that these people come from all over the world and there's no unifying culture, history, or anything there.", "I remembered wrong -- looks like it was the Kimono Wednesdays event at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts during the summer of 2015.", "My rule of thumb has always been first consent, then context. If a culture has generally given consent for 'outsiders' to wear a traditional piece of clothing, and it's being used in an appreciative context, then it's generally okay.", "I and my Japanese mom think it's awesome that you are sharing you LOVE for a different country.", "Well said!!!!", "What you're doing is cultural appreciation. If you wore the kimono for Halloween as a customer like being a s3xy gesiha, then that's cultural appropriation. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA.  You were told you could wear clothing if the country you were reporting on, so those that criticized you should have taken it up with the teacher in advance if they had problems.  They were probably just jealous because you were going to get a better grade.", "NTA. That's cultural appreciation. Its nonsense to say that one race cant dress in traditional clothes of another. Let's appreciate what our differences are and appreciate the world cultures. It brings us closer together to see each other as human", "NTA\n\nLet me guess the people criticizing you weren't Japanese?", "People don\u2019t know cultural appropriation.

We both experienced being dressed in Kimono and the Japanese people who assisted us were very supportive and not upset at all that two white westerners were wearing Kimono.

I was confused why I was suddenly BIPOC instead of WOC but this clarifies things a bit.", "Yes, it's my understanding that it's akin to stolen valor.\n\nI also have heard people explain that given the particular cultural history where Native American children were locked away in residential schools and kept from participating in their culture (in part of a program where the mission statement was literally 'kill the Indian, save the man'), while white kids were free to dress up as 'Indians' in costumes that included toy bonnets, it's a particularly sensitive subject, because the dominant culture was simultaneously saying 'you can't have your own culture,' and 'we're going to play with your sacred items like they're part of a game.'", "Cultural appropriation does seem particularly ironic when the origin group was/is attacked for doing the thing themselves."]}
