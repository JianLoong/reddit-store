Wearing a kimono is absolutely not cultural appropriation, it is cultural appreciation. Cultural appropriation would be dressing as a Geisha, or Maiko and mocking or misrepresenting their cultural significance as artists. If you ever travel to Gion, there are artisans that will dress you in traditional Geisha garb. Everything in Japan is ok to do if done respectfully of the culture. Wearing a kimono is respectful appreciation the way you did it.", "NTA, not cultural appropiation either. People just want to make others feel bad for no reason.", ">A few people said it was cultural appropriation, and I felt pretty bad afterwards. AITA?\n\nIgnore those kind of people. NTA.", "NTA \nUnless you were wearing a kimono with a special significance like a wedding or funeral kimono then it's no big deal. There are literally tons of stores in Japan that rent kimono to tourists. \nSome people don't really understand cultural appropriation.", "NTA. my moms was japanese and no one in my family ever had a negative thing to say about someone not japanese wearing a kimono. They enjoyed when non japanese people wore or were interested in kimonos and japanese culture. I dont mind, my family doesnt mind and I am sure other random japanese strangers wont mind. A purple kimono sounds beautiful! I had a pink one when I was younger.", "NTA. You were representing Japan.", "NTA. Since you simply wished to honor the culture, it likely falls under cultural appreciation.", "NTA. Sounds like people making problems where there is none.", "You\u2019re respecting the culture and acknowledging the heritage - NTA. People keep throwing \u201cappropriation\u201d around without knowing what it means. The internet, 2023.", "So, you were allowed to dress up to support the county you chose for your project, but your outfit was a problem? Why were the outfits of other people representing other countries not a problem? \n\nI\u2019m not Japanese, so I don\u2019t have a right to say anything. Yet, I imagine that if you wear a kimono with respect and not to mock, it\u2019s appreciation and not appropriation?", "NTA. [Here's what Japanese people feel about non-Japanese wearing the kimono. ](https://youtu.be/0pXotxxYFlk)", "Absolutely NTA. \nYou wore a kimono because you were interested in Japanese culture, not because you wanted to mock it. \nThat's what you need to ask yourself when this kind of issues rise. Are we doing this because we admire it and want to learn from this culture or to make fun of it? Those kind of claims of cultural appropriation are such an American thing to do. I don't where are you from but I can assure you that these issues mainly exist only within those borders. \nOutside people LOVE to share their culture! Especially Japanese people, going to Japan and wearing their typical clothing is something that they appreciate very much because you're showing interest in their culture.\nLacks of understanding and fights happen because of division, while sharing culture help us to tear down such barriers and learn that despite our differences we're all human beings with even worth and rights.", "NTA. \n\nYou represented Japan. Ignore these dumdums who simply throw around words like \"cultural appropriation\" without knowing what it means.\nStand firm.", "I come from an Asian country where there are several different established cultures. I LOVE the traditional clothing of all these cultures, and so do many people around here. We dress up in all kinds of outfits. Even brides and grooms wear wedding attires belonging to cultures different from their own, and so do many guests. I did that too, at my wedding! It's awesome and I would be very much bummed if I didn't get to wear the pretty dresses and jewelry of those other cultures.\n\nSeriously, at least when it comes to Asians, I don't think anyone gives a damn about who's wearing our cultural cloths and who's not. If anything, we are usually delighted to see someone from a different culture wearing our dresses, because to us, that means they appreciate our culture and find our dresses pretty!! :)\n\nPeople might get offended if you dress up as clergy of their religion, though. You might want to steer clear of that.", "NTA. Cultural appropriation is a lie.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's an honor to our culture. Thank you!!!", "100%. I remember videos of protestors in the US trying to stop people from attending an exhibition about Japanese culture, clothes, etc. Claiming it was \"BIPOC\" culture and people outside of them shouldn't see it.\n\nNone of them were Japanese, and actual Japanese attending the event very much disagreed with their take. \n\nThese people create problems where there are none, the Japanese I've met so far were happy to show others their culture and customs and share it with them.", "And in general cultural appropriation is taking something that has traditionally been seen as bad/low class/trashy and then saying it\u2019s a new fashionable thing that came out of nowhere just invented recently. \n\nI can understand some of the hesitation in yourself wearing things that originated from minority cultures, because there has been a long history of cultural appropriation, especially around hair. For me I work with a lot of Native American tribes and their jewelry & clothing is just beautiful.

Might have happened more than once, though, given how punctillious American activists are in policing racial and ethnic boundaries.  \n\nMeanwhile in Japan and Korea, there's a lot of businesses that specifically cater to tourists who want to try wearing another country's national dress.  I was walking around Bukchon in Seoul a few years ago (a neighbourhood with picturesque traditional buildings) and I think a majority of of the girls wearing hanbok were speaking Chinese (at least, not English, Korean, or Japanese).
