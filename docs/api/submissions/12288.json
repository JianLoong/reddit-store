They told us not to worry about money because they covered the air bnb so all we would have to pay for is gas. It's a 19hr car drive. We arrived last Wednesday.\n\nMy in laws are so overbearing. Like if I go and take a shower, they are knocking on the door within 3 minutes to check on me. If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee. And they literally do not stop talking from sun up to sun down.\n\nI'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need \"me time\". I need to stop being followed. I need to decompress. His way of combating this was to be up my ass 24/7 and continuously asking if I'm okay or to bitch to me about how annoyed he is becoming. Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?\n\nETA: I mentioned to my in laws directly a few times that I needed space to decompress. Even when stating I needed to go on a walk to clear my head, they took it as an invitation to come along, despite me stating I needed space. Or like when I went to the bedroom, I announced it to the entire room that I needed a minute, and they proceeded to continuously yell up to me to make sure I was good. So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me. We had plenty of money to get home. We set aside a specific set of money for the gas back. Me spending my set aside money for the gas back did not in any way leave us stranded here.", "created_utc": 1678810373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rafaa/aita_for_spending_all_my_money_that_was_supposed/", "score": 1902, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You suck because if his family is that loud and overbearing, you probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to spend a vacation locked into an airbnb with them; you should made alternate arrangements, or just stayed home.

You could say that you warned them, but in reality you didn't warn about the outcome, just the issue.

Cheers", "ESH - I can see this is an unpopular opinion but as a fellow introvert I've got to say it.\n\nIf the OP has made it to fianc\u00e9e / fianc\u00e9 status, then surely OP has met the parents a time or two. I would think OP has had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time with them and this was not a first time meeting. If that was the case - I think OP would mention it here.\n\n**Operating on the assumption OP has interacted with the would-be in-laws previously and has also seen how they interact with the fianc\u00e9, OP should never have agreed to go on a trip where lodging would be shared.**\n\nAlso, if OP and fianc\u00e9 are not already co-habitating, I think it might be a good idea to try sharing a living space before getting married because some introverts simply aren't equipped, especially younger introverts who haven't had a chance to develop more coping skills aka lies / subterfuge (lol), to deal with people in their space practically 24/7.\n\nA few years ago - my Father and Mother, (now deceased) who could be very chatty, overbearing and over-protective, called me after they took a trip to visit my brother, sister-in-law and their kids. I grew up and remained fairly close with my Mother and knew this was her way of showing love and interest, my brother had moved across the country (military) at a fairly young age and while not estranged, he was not super close with the rest of the family.\n\nMy Mother was not happy about the trip. She was telling me all sorts of 'crazy' and 'unreasonable' things my sister-in-law did - like going on hikes by herself, 'to clear her head,' even though there were warnings about bobcat sightings and constantly leaving the house to go to grocery store even though there was plenty of food in the house. (I suspect these were sanity breaks.)  Later I got a call from my brother and of course, his description / perception of the trip was VERY different.\n\nOP said they arrived last week Wed and today is Wed. How long was this freaking trip supposed to be?!  A week or week+ in an AirBnB, with a 19 hour road trip bookending the whole thing? Even for someone who's not introverted, that seems like a lot ... Yikes.\n\nEdit - I forgot this part -\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 should have been supportive of your needs.

Your fianc\u00e9 sounds like they reverted to some childhood habits being around their parents, mimicking their complaining a bit. Now\u2019s a good time for you two to discuss how you each need to handle this exposure to his parents going forward. Fianc\u00e9 clearly needs to vent, and you need space.

I said, somewhat snippily, \"Sorry, I have to get back.\" Left me stressed and annoyed the rest of the day. Such a minor thing, shouldn't have mattered at all.\n\nI'm okay feeling trapped if I'm alone. For example, car breaks down, or snowfall blocking the driveway.
