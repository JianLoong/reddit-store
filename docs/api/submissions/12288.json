They told us not to worry about money because they covered the air bnb so all we would have to pay for is gas. It's a 19hr car drive. We arrived last Wednesday.\n\nMy in laws are so overbearing. Like if I go and take a shower, they are knocking on the door within 3 minutes to check on me. If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee. And they literally do not stop talking from sun up to sun down.\n\nI'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need \"me time\". I need to stop being followed. I need to decompress. His way of combating this was to be up my ass 24/7 and continuously asking if I'm okay or to bitch to me about how annoyed he is becoming. Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?\n\nETA: I mentioned to my in laws directly a few times that I needed space to decompress. Even when stating I needed to go on a walk to clear my head, they took it as an invitation to come along, despite me stating I needed space. Or like when I went to the bedroom, I announced it to the entire room that I needed a minute, and they proceeded to continuously yell up to me to make sure I was good. So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me. We had plenty of money to get home. We set aside a specific set of money for the gas back. Me spending my set aside money for the gas back did not in any way leave us stranded here.", "created_utc": 1678810373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rafaa/aita_for_spending_all_my_money_that_was_supposed/", "score": 639, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You suck because if his family is that loud and overbearing, you probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to spend a vacation locked into an airbnb with them; you should made alternate arrangements, or just stayed home.

You could say that you warned them, but in reality you didn't warn about the outcome, just the issue. It seems like this is similar.\n\nI need space could mean that someone is about to break up with you, or leave for the night, or they need 2 min, or that you're standing too close, and everything is fine if they just back up 6 inches.
