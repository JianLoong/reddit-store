However I came home from work the other day and he was only several hours into the game and he starts spoiling the locations of all of the best armor, shields, weapons, etc. to me and it turns out he YouTubed where to find all the stuff.

I told him I didn\u2019t want to discuss the game with him anymore as I like to organically progress and find things throughout these games on my own. I explained to him that it felt like cheating. His mother does not like that I made a thing out of it and I feel like my feelings and history with this franchise have been minimized. She is a big Harry Potter fan and I told her that it would be like him spoiling the last book for her. Anyways, again I know it\u2019s silly because its a video game and I know he is just trying to impress me, but looking up where to get the best stuff isn\u2019t impressive to me and I don\u2019t want to hear it.", "created_utc": 1685250958, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ts58e/aita_for_not_talking_about_zelda_with_my_step_son/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My son is younger, but he does this too. He discusses movies and games with friends at school, or watches stuff online, and then he wants to talk to me about them before I've seen or played them. He doesn't mind being spoiled himself, so it's been hard to get him to understand that I prefer going in without knowing anything. He's also kind of a blabbermouth and regularly spoils me by accident. I've had to put a ban on discussing franchises I really care about until I get caught up. \n\nYour stepson is a kid who probably wants to impress you. But he's old enough that you can reason with him to get him to understand your preference. I would refrain from calling his way of playing \"cheating,\" though. He's allowed his preference too.", "NTA. You are telling him how you would not like to know. That\u2019s fair and it is like spoiling the ending of the book. You are being gentle when telling him and explain why.", "If you do not impart your values (right or wrong) as a dad, what the heck is the point of having them?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. No one likes spoilers whatever their age. He should understand that.", "NTA\n\nOld enough to learn and understand an important lesson about empathy. Also lying for no reason might be cause he wants to impress you but that\u2019s not an out. It\u2019s not okay to steal if it\u2019s a gift for you lmao \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the kid sorted. People who still pull this shit when they\u2019re adults are fucking psychos lmao", "Soft YTA, i understand where you are coming from with respect to the spoilers but he's just an excited (barely) teen wanting to share this with you. \n\nExplain you don't want spoilers but you are happy to talk about the game in other ways, like what cool contraption he made with the mechanics in game, has he built a cool house etc", "YTA\n\nYour son was attempting to bond with you over something that he knows you love, and you shot him down and shut him up. Nice move. /s", "> So he is spoiling the game for himself and now me.\n\nYTA for gatekeeping how HE plays the game.\n\nTelling him you don't want to hear about it is one thing. Getting upset because he used Youtube to find things is just stupid.\n\nCongrats! You just killed a HUGE opportunity to bond with your stepson. Discussing the game without spoiling it IS possible, you just don't want to make the effort.", "How old are you, exactly? Also, you are in a parental role to this child, and you know what doesn\u2019t make for good parenting? Being petty. \n\nIn a situation where the other person is 13 and you are in your 30s, you have to be the bigger person and let some things go. \n\nAlso, everybody handles a favorite thing differently - maybe he wanted to impress you: ever thought about that? By calling what he\u2019s doing \u2018cheating\u2019 you\u2019re gatekeeping a video game and I can\u2019t even. \n\nYTA\n\nYou  have some growing up to do if you want to stay in your relationship with this boy\u2019s mom (newsflash: if she\u2019s not into Zelda as you two are, she might be having second thoughts about someone who gets into a oneupmanship contest with her 13-year old).\n\n(Edited because I saw the light! This guy should not be parenting anyone until he grows up)", "Yta", "NTA. I\u2019ve had to have similar conversations with my kids about spoilers concerning our shared interests. Maybe a lesson about empathy would help. They won\u2019t appreciate it until they understand it.", "NTA. Granted I understand he might be trying to impress you, but chances are, he was trying to outdo you since you have been playing for years.

Its only a game, but integrity is a very important part of my philosophy.

Because I don\u2019t think we read the same thing. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly acceptable to set boundaries with children. Not a gamer, but I enjoy logic puzzles.

Cus when if he found it on YouTube he still found it.... \n\nGet your point about spoilers though but the kid probably did not realize your stand on it and thought he was helping you get the best items/beat the game. \n\nAgree with soft YTA because you reacted poorly to a kid trying to help.", "He is THIRTEEN.

You're lucky that teenage boy wants to do anything with you.", "Thanks for helping me see my first judgement was too generous to you: congrats, you are the asshole!", "I see.
