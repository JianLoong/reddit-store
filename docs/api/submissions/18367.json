My son is younger, but he does this too. He discusses movies and games with friends at school, or watches stuff online, and then he wants to talk to me about them before I've seen or played them. He doesn't mind being spoiled himself, so it's been hard to get him to understand that I prefer going in without knowing anything. He's also kind of a blabbermouth and regularly spoils me by accident. I've had to put a ban on discussing franchises I really care about until I get caught up. \n\nYour stepson is a kid who probably wants to impress you.

Nice move. /s", "> So he is spoiling the game for himself and now me.\n\nYTA for gatekeeping how HE plays the game.\n\nTelling him you don't want to hear about it is one thing.

It's the first Zelda game I've ever gotten *on release day,* so it's a special experience for me. This doesn't stop my friends who don't play it from looking things up out of curiosity. On a few occasions, I have asked for very minor help on a couple of tasks.\n\nMy advice? Talk to the kid and suggest that he ask you if you would like to know these things. If the answer is no, he keeps quiet. If you decide you'd like help, he can tell you then. You can't stop him from spoiling it for himself, but you can at least enforce that he doesn't spoil it for *you.*", "NTA that would suck", "NTA...fuck that shit started telling everybody the ending and all key points of all movies in the future.....(you can find most movies plots a week after they release)\nSee how they like that", "NAH \nEveryone is entitled to play a game how they wish, I personally will play the game organically but if I get stuck I'll be the first to get on the Internet to look up the solution/hidden gems.

Maybe you can both find a way to discuss the game without mentioning spoilers?", "NAH - but as someone with a rich history of Zelda playing and a nephew who's enthusiastic about it I would've have it in me to stop him. I hope you didn't phrase in a way that makes him feel like it's cheating because it's not, it's just a different way to play and experience a game, treading on that would make you an ah imo\n\nI'm generally not upset by a spoiler unless it's something key,  letting it go and drop it off I hear one helps put it out of mind.\n\nthere's something special about playing games organically but there's also something special about connecting with your step son, putting a child's needs before your own as to not make them feel unheard or unwanted.\n\nBorderline", "NTA. We had this problem in my house, too, but when I told my 15yo, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me spoilers from ToTK, you\u2019re further along than me,\u201d he said, \u201cOk.\u201d", "Nah.

As someone who entered gaming at age 30, I can say my brain does not comprehend some stuff in games still. It was hard to learn how to interact with the worlds and what to look for. BOTW was my first two joystick game (my last system was the n64). So yeah, I googled the shit out of stuff. Because that\u2019s the handicap I needed to have fun! Now with tears of the kingdom I\u2019m trying it with no google. It\u2019s much more difficult!\n\nIt sounds like your stepson has his handicap mode on and you just don\u2019t want him spoiling it for you. Reasonable, but there were much kinder ways to set that boundary. Especially if you want to continue bonding over gaming. \n\nSide note: the HP spoiler comparison was spot on. I\u2019m also a HP geek and played the new HP game pretty organically. My kids spoiled a couple things for me and it definitely felt like someone spoiling the end of a favorite book.", "You are kind TA.", "NTA\n\nOne of my friends does this. I rarely play games but sometimes there's one that looks cool, like the Forest, so I played that one. We played it without knowing anything about it and it was awesome, literally running around yelling in our mics scared af. So fun\n\nThe second one came out recently so we were gonna play it again, without looking at any reviews or anything. We go online and the one guy that is known for watching guides for everything lasts about 6 seconds before telling us where to go, what to collect, how to build stuff.

The first time is the only chance for an unspoiled watch / playthrough, so most would prefer to not have that ruined, then in future enjoy knowing what happens", "I mean sure? I already don't usually mind spoilers, as I said. I'm saying it's rude to ignore when someone else asks you not to spoil something new for them.", "I\u2019m actually further along in the story than him, and that\u2019s my point.
