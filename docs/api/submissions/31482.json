Hopefully she's a good mum in other ways and it won't be too hard for you to hang in there till you can move out.", "NTA sorry to hear this OP.  You teach people how you want to be treated.  If you're going to shout down every objection, insist on getting your own way in the face of everyone you meet you don't get to be shocked when your own kid tells you the people in your life don't want to be honest with you.  Good grief you can't make your children support your new marriage, that's a horrible way to treat your kids and pretty much guarantees they'll never get on board!  Not too long until you can get out of there OP, your mother is on the road to being low to no contact with all her 'loved ones'.", "NTA you might have given her food for thought too! Feel proud of yourself and keep doing you,  things might improve as she gradually adjusts to her children becoming adults.  Idiotic parents often don't seem to realise this will happen.", "NTA. Your mum can't have it both ways. You can't be honest at the same time as telling her what she wants to hear. It is one thing not to be too unhappy that your mother remarries, and quite another to have your mother's husband take up every little part of the role your father played in your life. It is quite unreasonable of your mum to expect that. The same way she has lost friends, she is at risk of losing her kids too. And in general, as you grow up, and you have a cantankerous person in your circles, you will tend to give that person a wide berth, even if she is your mum. That kind of people are just so exhausting.", "My stepmother is the same. Growing up with her was a constant struggle, and we got to the point where I wouldn't just not talk to her about things, but I actively avoided interacting with her at all. I moved out at 18, I'm now 26, and speak to her as little as possible. Her biological kids haven't had any contact with her whatsoever in over 30 years. I sat down with her once, and said that she needed to be quiet and let me finish speaking whilst I explained how I felt, and that I know how frustrated she gets when she feels she's in the right but that it was incredibly important to our future relationship that she listen without interrupting. She did actually shut up and listen to what I had to say. However, she wasn't able to understand my perspective, even after I attempted to explain it to her in a few different ways.\n\nYou can always try. If you want to have that battle with your mother, it's your choice. But I'll warn you that she may never set aside her pride and see things your way. Your relationship with her might change as you get older, it might not. But, OP, truly, it is NOT your responsibility to change her. It is NOT your responsibility to make her a better person or a better mother. It is not even your responsibility to make her see reason. Some people will fight you on things forever just because they want to feel powerful or right. You can try if you want to. But don't waste your life fighting with her if you don't want to. You are allowed to move on and leave her behind - be that cutting her off completely, or just establishing boundaries to keep her at arm's length. Regardless, do what's best for you, not what's best for her. And don't let her guilt you into changing your mind about it. If she won't listen to you, you certainly don't have to listen to her.\n\nYou deserve better.", "She sounds obnoxious.

From what you shared she's been able to push those around her to comply with her wants and it's making her angry that she is now losing control. I wish I could say that more honest open conversations with her would help her gain some self-awareness but that most likely won't be the case. Protect your peace, limit contact with her and just like your siblings make an exit when you can.", "Bit difficult at 16.", "They don\u2019t NEED to but if they decide that\u2019s better for them, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that option.
