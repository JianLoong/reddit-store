It's a very weird situation to me.\n\nSo, My(30f) ex boyfriend, Mark(36m), and I were together for 4 years. It was a very abusive relationship(mental and financial) which only ended after he cheated on me with my best friend. We had 1 child together(10m). After the breakup, I tried to remain civil for our kid, commonly sharing holidays,  birthdays and different life events (for our kid). I can handle being in the same room as him but he thinks we're are one big happy family. I married the love of my life 2 years ago and we had our youngest together a little over a year ago. Since the baby was born, I don't do too much with Mark anymore. He's met my youngest twice.\n\nIssues started popping up when the baby turned 1. I did not invite Mark or his family to the baby's birthday... because he is not my friend or my family. He got upset and told me not to let it happen again. The second instance was not inviting him to the pumpkin patch. \n\nThe most recent was the baby's \"graduation\" party from the infant room at his daycare. Something seemed to snap in Mark and he angrily messaged me about not letting him be involved in the baby's life. I told him my baby was not his child and I didn't have to involve him in a damn thing. I told him the only reason he's even seen my baby is because of our oldest and I would prefer if he had no contact with him at all. The argument ended in him calling me a dumb, petty batch.\n\nWell, in true Mark fashion, he ran his mouth to everyone and now I have people telling me I need to play nice and let him know my baby because that's his son's brother.

Mark seems unhinged and potentially violent. He sounds obsessed with your youngest child in a way that he isn\u2019t with his own child. \n\nYou seem so worried about keeping the peace that I don\u2019t think you are using a strong enough tone with Mark, and he thinks he can steamroller over you and your husband. He is not part of your family, only part of your oldest\u2019s family. If I were you I\u2019d make every effort to keep him away from your youngest.\n\nAs for others having an opinion? They don\u2019t matter and aren\u2019t worth even responding to. \n\nBest of luck!", "NTA. Your youngest is Not his kid. You're NOT his wife. He's not entitled to squat. \n\nIf you don't already take personal and home security measures, it wouldn't be a bad idea to see how to set up a camera system on your home and get a wifi baby monitor for the littles' rooms.", "NTA and you need to shut this down NOW. I don't know what kind of custody arrangement you have but from now on, Mark can see your shared child and only him. No more joint parties or invitations to 'family' gatherings. I don't know what people you have in your life that are encouraging you to share your family but they need to mind their own business. He's your ex for very valid reasons.", "Once an abusive asshole always an abusive asshole. This Mofo really told you \u201cnot to let it happen again\u201d. Or what? He acts like he owns you.  Where is your husband when all this is happening? He needs to  check this asshole.  He sounds unhinged. Document everything. You may need a restraining order.", "NTA- he doesn\u2019t have to be invited/involved/see/know you and your husband\u2019s baby. That\u2019s  strange. If your child is doing something , he is not family, nor a friend and is not entitled to be around YOUR baby. anything your oldest is doing , is the only time he needs to be around. He is not apart of your marriage. This isn\u2019t a threesome. He is baby daddy. That\u2019s it. He just wants to try to continue to control you and your life. Don\u2019t let it happen again? Or what? Sounds like a episode of he thought and will found out. Don\u2019t invite him. Ever.", "The only reason he wants to get to know your youngest is to control you. He can use it as an excuse to be around you, and perhaps even develop a relationship with your youngest to manipulate him. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHis behavior and dare I say, obsession, with your baby sounds very scary to me. You and your husband should definitely take more security measures. Absolutely make sure to document his behavior in the chance you feel the need to establish legal precautions against Mark. Yeah, he's your older son's baby brother, but Mark isn't entitled to knowing who he is or attending his celebrations. He's your child with another man. That's it.", "NTA\nHave your current husband handle business fuck mark he\u2019s not good for our family", "NTA. Ok, record ALL of this. Every bit of info on this you can get. This dude is dangerous and threatening you AND your baby. You also need to consult a lawyer. \n\nYou are definitely NTA, this is seriously terrifying.", "NTA\nF**k off Mark,  it's not your baby. It's time to immediately put barriers up here,  Mark is delusional and needs to be kept away from baby. Go (back?) to court if you have to. Communicating only through written word (text or email). He can't come to your house any more,  drop off and collection of eldest to be in public places, don't invite him to anything you organise (your 10 year old will notice if there's tension at an event and believe it's about them). You will need to talk about this with 10 and let them know things are going to change amd possibly get them into therapy to help navigate this.  Sounds like Mark is a narcissist, there's no reasoning with somebody like him so you just have to be very firm with boundaries.  Your new baby has nothing to do with him and anybody who tries to make you think otherwise is as crazy as Mark.  He thinks because he abused you in the past you will allow it to continue, this stops now, it's insane.", "NTA. He is abusive. That is reason enough for no contact.", "NTA. Be careful. Your ex is giving off some dangerous red flags.", "Who are these people to you,  who are telling you to include Mark?! \n\nHonestly, you need to cut those flying monkeys off from your life and your kids lives...no one in my family or my friends would demand I include my ex, my kids dad, and he was also abusive. They are *not* on your side and will take any opportunity to undermine you (including feeding him information about you) and worse, put you and your youngest at risk.\n\nYour ex is dangerous because he *still* believes he can control you and is obviously weaponizing the kids for sympathy and to control. This is becoming an obsession for him because he isn't getting his way.\n\nDo you have a custody order for your oldest, shared son? I would be conferring with a lawyer and escalating your complaint.

Bring his son to the door with his backpack when he comes to puck him up, then close the door and lock it. Don\u2019t engage any more than is absolutely necessary.

Secondly, he needs to be aware in case Mark flips out. His son is involved.", "You need to cut the communication to the minimum.

I think in some weird and twisted way, he thinks if he can get in good with the baby, and see you, his desire for you all to be that big, happy family again will come true. I would put up more boundaries with Mark. Make it clear he has no access to the baby\u2019s or your life. He only has access to your mutual child. To the people saying you need to \u201cplay nice and let him know your baby\u201d I would say \u201cI did play nice and he got to know my best friend REAL well. He is lucky I have been as amicable as I have been! I do not need to play nice or let him get to know mine and my HUSBANDS child!
