Good for you for sticking up for your brother.  Auntie should have paid separately for her extras if she was so insistent.", "Assuming that your aunt isn't booting the cost, yeah that's incredibly embarrassing behavior. NTA. Not sure why grown adults feel the need to be toddlers at weddings.", "Nta - it\u2019s not minor, and your aunt WAS being a diva, a very entitled one at that.", "NTA. You called out an adult behaving extremely inappropriately at an event.\n\nYou didn't start the drama. You just stopped your aunt taking advantage of others people's generosity/reluctance to cause a scene.", "I feel sorry the bride is marrying into this mess.", "NTA, appears that your aunt showed her true class and its best not to have them for the wedding. How cheap can some people get? Its a rehearsal and you are there to support the event, not get pissed on expensive wine. Good that you did the right thing.", "I figured how do your brother and his wife feel about it? For me that determines my judgement. Since it wasn't your event you kind of don't have the authority's to kick her out. I would have told your dad or something to avoid letting it to the bride and groom if that's a worry. However if they are not upset with you then you're good.", "Aunt is entitled.  She has no manners.\n\n$200 may by minor to some, but not to all.  Maybe your mother should have offered to pay for her sister?\n\nI think you did the right thing.  I think cousin's walking out shows that he is also entitled.\n\nI feel sad for the bride and groom.  But Aunt stepped way over the line, and  thought she could get away with it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Good for you for calling out her entitlement. And anyone who thinks her behavior was ok should\u2019ve volunteered to pay for what she wanted to eat and drink.", "NTA", "NTA, tell your mom next time her sister is doing that, shes free to pay for it", "NTA- Your mom is the same species like Diva.", "Sorry but soft YTA. It was not your place to say anything. You didn't pay this dinner.\n\nEdit: I added \"soft\" because groom seems to agree with you, but still people who where paying said it's ok.", ">The bride's parents tried to tell me the cost was ok, but my dad, brother, and I decided it was enough and made my aunt and cousin leave.\n\nYTA\n\nWell-intentioned and your aunt certainly WAS being a diva, but there are appropriate ways to handle this and kicking her (and your cousin) out were not it.\n\nFirst of all, what is her issue with the food?  (Was there an issue, or she just wanted something different).\n\nIf she wants a wine bottle that is not included, she should pay for it.  And it's not for you to say, it is for her sibling (your dad?) to say.  And if she doesn't pay for it, your dad is responsible and should go track it down.  Then, your cousin, a completely separate individual is out of the wedding party.  Your whole family made a show.  Yes, your aunt was tacky but none of you handled this with grace or class.\n\nBut honestly, all of this could've been handled by speaking to the server and having them tell her no.\n\nThe bride's family was extremely gracious, but this likely shows them that she is marrying into a drama-filled family.", "YTA. What on earth right do you have to ask someone to leave a dinner you aren\u2019t hosting? Your aunt was definitely being rude, but the hosts didn\u2019t object, only you did, and it was, like she said, none of your damn business. For all you know she was planning to offer to pay for the extra order. You caused a massive scene and drama for literally no reason. It should be telling that literally nobody seems to be on your side here.", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't your business.\n\nHere's how this works at these kinds of events, in my experience:\n\nThe person hosting the meal has previously made arrangements with the restaurant. If a guest wants to go beyond the parameters of what has been agreed, the waiter will say something like \"I will check whether we can do that today, ma'am\", and discreetly check with the host as to whether the extra cost is acceptable. (The arrangements may well allow the guests to go beyond the set menu on request. Or might allow a certain dollar amount of extras, in total. )\n\nAnd then the news spreads that Aunt X doesn't know how to behave in polite company, and she just doesn't get invited to places. Ever.\n\nYou tried to stop your aunt from doing this, presumably because you felt responsibility for \"your\" side of the family, and didn't want her to be so embarrassing. And your aunt is clearly a world-class asshole. But unless you get the chance to discreetly wind your aunt in before she embarrasses herself, you just make it worse.", "Holy shit.  I have to go with soft YTA, but it's not because you called her a diva.  I think you were being more polite than I would have been lol.  People like her make me want to hit something.\n\nBut...when she said it was none of your business, she wasn't entirely wrong.  So then it escalated and you kept pushing, and this probably is something you'd want to avoid in the future.   This was the biggest day of your brother and sister-in-law's life.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The bride's parents tried to tell me the cost was ok, but my dad, brother, and I decided it was enough and made my aunt and cousin leave.\"  MAybe the aunt and cousin will be back in the wedding if they kick YOU out.

The ones paying were probably trying to just keep the peace, but I don't know what your aunt was playing at, but acting like she was better than everyone is not the way to go.  It's embarassing and reflects badly on the rest of the family.  Why your mom was upset and trying to validate her sister's behaviour isn't right, either.

If the real (!) hosts of this event accepted the behavior (who actually paid for everything and probably will never invite that woman again), then it wasn\u2019t your place to play the hero here.
