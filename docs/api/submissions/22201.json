Acknowledge that's where this post is coming from, it has little to do with your outrage over him taking the cat to the emergency vet and taking a day off work to do so, then smoking out with his brother while he mourns. It's ok to be anxious about finances, it's normal to be a little resentful when you're supporting people over 18, and it's ok to crabby as you heal.

You also do not get to invalidate his emotions by telling him to grow up, and you do not get to determine how he should handle his feelings.

He is juggling unexpected emergency, unexpected expense. Your reaction seems overly dramatic and catastrophizing, imo. You are also majorly stressing and hovering  over things you cannot control -- every financial decision *they* make. What you can/could have controlled is *your* situation, things like redesign your original promise of letting them stay there rent free after your injury which changed the situation. Or again before baby came into the mix which changed the situation. Or have a timeframe by which they'll need to start paying some rent, etc. In the current situation, you are resentful -- counting their savings, calculating in your head what they are spending that you think they shouldn't. None of those everyday decisions were in your original agreement, leaving you to assume they'd make the choices you think are correct. That never works.", "Maybe you guys need some space and should devise a plan for them to move out.

Very sudden and was no way we could financially afford that kind of treatment. I didn't take off work, I didn't go get high or partake in any risky behavior in order to control myself. I took the responsibility for my pet and had him put to sleep. I was there with him as he closed his eyes. I cried with my daughters and my wife.", "Thank you for that. Actual input on how I'm handling things does put it into perspective for me. I wouldn't necessarily say I count all their spending, but I am mindful.
