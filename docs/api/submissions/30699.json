Ten days is a long time and she could have shot a \"Hey my life is super busy right now, can't talk much\" at any time.", "She tried to ghost you and now she's mad that you moved on after a week already. \n\nAnd what would a second chance mean in this case? Apologizing and groveling for being \"unfaithful\"? \n\nNtA", "NTA.  \nYou thought you clicked. She either disagreed or was trying to play the treat 'em mean keep 'em keen game...  \nOne of which was a childish way to deal with the situation and the other runs the risk of just losing touch if you play even slightly wrong.   \nEither way you were completely within your right to start looking again if she wasn't responding. It's not like you left it for one day and started looking again, or sent false signals. You attempted to keep contact and she dropped the ball.\n\nQuite honestly, even if things didn't work out with second lady, I wouldn't be going back to first lady without an extremely good reason for her behaviour (something along the lines of \"I was out with covid\" or \"my pet/family/friend died/was extremely ill\" Things that class as emergencies), and even then after 10 days of silence and petering it off before that I'm not sure I'd take it as a good reason.\n\nThis lady isn't upset because you matched with someone else. She's just upset because you matched with her friend and it's now awkward for her because during group meetings you're going to be potentially around. Thats not your problem.\n\nI would have expected this sort of behaviour from a 18 -25 year old maybe as they're still working out how to deal with unwanted relationships and the like but by the time you hit your 30's you really should have some sort of idea how to break things off without just ghosting unless there's a good reason for ghosting.\n\nWhat you're going to have to decide however is if you want to be around this lady, since they are friends of the level that they see each other's messages etc, there's a really good chance she's going to be at any future gatherings and you are going to have to find a way to navigate this level of crazy.\n\nI would definitely not touch this first lady with a 20foot barge pole though. That path leads to extreme unhappiness and insecurity and never knowing if you did something to upset her or not anytime she decides you're not a priority in her life.", "I'm also going with NTA here. She indicated that she was not really interested in you, and you had no prior agreement to be exclusive with each other at all. If she was genuinely interested in you, she could have explained the reasons for her silence and asked you to continue the conversation instead of blowing up at you out of nowhere.", "NTA. Bullet dodged! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "I'm not sure where \"unacceptable behavior\" came into it. You're not her dad grounding her cuz she talked back. You hadn't heard from her in 10 days. You weren't seeing each other anymore, so you were single and free to match with anyone you want.\n\nNta. Are you sure the friend is real? Maybe she's just catfishing to test if you're \"loyal\"... Either way congrats on dodging that particular bullet.", "you went out a few times, she ghosted you, and now she\u2019s acting like a betrayed spouse. you weren\u2019t unfaithful. there was nothing to be faithful to. who in their right mind assumes exclusivity after a few dates? you weren\u2019t exclusive, nor were you even seeing each other at all anymore. you\u2019re not a lamppost, she can\u2019t piss on you once and own you in perpetuity. consider this a bullet dodged, and do not let your friend group put you back in the line of fire. \n\nnta.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t communicate, is that someone you\u2019d want to actually date? We take the time to respond to those we are interested in.  If she couldn\u2019t take the 2 seconds to send you a text saying she\u2019s super busy, then you weren\u2019t on her mind and a priority to her. I\u2019d not contact either woman and look for something with less drama attached.", "Assuming everything about this is completely true and you haven't left out any details about things you said or did before the radio silence, you're kind of both AHs. She's the bigger AH for ghosting instead of communicating that she wasn't interested anymore, and you're an AH for not bothering to tell her that you were taking her silence as an end to the relationship before you hopped back on the app. Imo, the only reason you wouldn't say anything to her about getting back to the app is because you were hoping she'd come back and be none the wiser to you getting back at it. But, even if you're completely innocent in all this, the lack of closure from you to her still leaves you a little bit of an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should have apologized for going silent, not try to play a reverse uno on you for moving on from a relationship that had ended. You don't need someone's agreement to end a relationship, you can simply decide \"I haven't heard from them for ages, relationship over\". This isn't a situation where you acted hastily, nor does she have a good excuse for going silent, she just ignored you and doesn't like the consequences.", "NTA, your friend group is strange.", "NTA - and I'm guessing your match with her friend wasn't a coincidence. I'm wondering if it was a weird test of some sort on her part to see if you were a 'good guy' (in her mind). Because otherwise, why in the world would she have the messages between you and friend? I have a ton of friends on dating sites, and not once have any of them shown me messages from a match. It's just strange all around. I absolutely wouldn't give her a second chance, especially based on her lack of communication skills for 10 days.", "She FAAFO and you dodged a massive bullet. NTA, not even close.", "NTA. I don't know what your communications were like prior to her ghosting you or if you had even established that you were in an exclusive relationship, but if you're casually seeing someone and they disappear for an extended period of time, then it's pretty reasonable to just move on. You don't owe her a second chance, she blew it", "Nta\n\nIt doesn't sound like she'd even want a second chance. Did she explain *why* she pretty much cut all contact for 2 weeks? Did she even try to apologize? What do your friends consider \"giving her a second chance\"?", "Listen: if you snooze you lose. I would not waste anymore time with her.

You had said, \"a while,\" in your post which is difficult to interpret because that could be a different amount from person to person. I could be reading between the lines a bit too much here, but I feel like there's more information than just what you've presented in the post.", "We don't know that they weren't. I think they might have been or he'd at least let her believe they were.", "He just told you that they weren't."]}
