It was a packed flight and my row-mates were a mother (late 30s?) with a young child (maybe 5 or 6). They brought a bunch of arts and crafts to keep the kid busy - things like a glue stick, markers, paper, craft sticks. Sounds cute, right? Well, not when the glitter came out. \n\nThe child, let's call her Glitter Godzilla (GG), was making a mess, and since she was in the middle seat, the glitter would spill over onto my side. If you remember glitter from elementary school, it\u2019s messy AF if you try attaching it to paper. There\u2019s a lot of shake off and most of it doesn\u2019t stick. \n\nSo yeah the glitter and marks from the glue stick rolling off the gray table was everywhere - on my shoes, my backpack, and my jeans.\n\nI'm patient and get kids can be messy, but this felt crazy. I tried catching the mom's eye, hoping she'd step in. But she just gave me a blank look like \"this is how it is.\" \n\nI\u2019m not confrontational so when I got up to use the bathroom, I quietly shared the situation with a flight attendant. She promised to discretely address it. \n\nWhen I got back to my seat, the mother was pissed. Idk what the flight attendant said but the mom claimed I was being discriminatory against mothers, and since the flight was delayed she was just trying to keep her child entertained. Then she started raising her voice, accusing me of being \"a selfish man with no understanding of children\". All this despite the fact that my lower half now looks bedazzled.\n\nThere were no other seats available, so I was stuck the rest of the flight with this lady\u2019s verbal attacks. The flight attendants gave me looks of sympathy but didn\u2019t want to step in. Of course the mother gave me a final fuck you as we deplaned. \n\nI travel a lot and this was the flight from hell. Not to mention it was pretty embarrassing in the airport. Not that I can blame people taking notice.\n\nAITA here? Was I wrong to get some help in dealing with what felt like a glitter assault? Should I have just sucked it up and became a human art project?", "created_utc": 1688006202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lsrk2/aita_for_reporting_a_mother_and_her_glitter/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She deserved to be called out. Having a kid doesn't mean you get to impose their messes on anyone else. The kid should have also been in the window seat.", "NTA\n\nIf even a *few* pieces of glitter work their way into the plane's avionic systems, the **entire flight is coming down**.\n\n... I mean, probably not, but that's what you say to the kid with a deathly serious face.", "I'll be honest, I laughed so hard at your description of this glittery hellscape that I woke up the entire house. You're hilarious.  \n\n\nNTA. Full disclosure, I'm a two-brained creature depending on my level of anxiety for the day, so frankly I might have just stowed my bag up somewhere and participated in the glitterpocalypse, but you are absolutely in no way the asshole for not wanting glue and glitter damage to your belongings. The mother is absolutely off her gourd for A) bringing *glitter onto a plane, who does that* but also B) reacting in such an overwrought rude way to being asked to maybe not detonate a glitter mine on a packed plane. There are so many art projects one can bring on a plane to entertain a child. Only an extremely entitled mother would think that glitter is acceptable in transit, either for the passengers or for the poor attendants that have to clean that out of the carpet and seats later. You handled it like a champ and were extremely polite. Don't worry about it, seriously.", "NTA. A plane is not a child's classroom. Of course, it's not always easy to entertain children on planes. But if you bring arts and crafts, it shouldn't be anyone else responsibility but the parents to clean it up, and they shouldn't be surprised if people are put off it.\n\nGiven her actions, she's just selfish and inconsiderate of others around her.", "NTA. While it's excellent for parents to keep their kids occupied on planes and bring things for them to do, they should also make sure the activities aren't going to be too bothersome or messy for other passengers or the flight crew. Glue and glitter aren't appropriate crafts for a plane ride.", "NTA\n\nI'm a mom. Who the fuck brings glitter on a plane? Even if you're adamantly against screens there's a TON of other things that don't involve thousands of tiny sparkly things that inevitably get everywhere. Not only was she inconsiderate of you but she was inconsiderate of whomever had to clean that ungodly mess.", "NTA. What kind of psycho would bring this on a plane?", "NTA- You're taking public transportation, so unfortunately, this comes with the territory. Terrible parenting all around, that sucks, dude.", "NTA not in the slightest. Glitter is barely containable indoors, let alone a plane! The mom was the only AH. Accountability is rare these days. Stickers are the same price as glitter and they\u2019re just as fun.", "NTA \n\nThere are lots of ways to entertain kids on flights that aren\u2019t hugely disrespectful to the flight staff and the passengers around you. That mother didn\u2019t need to bring a giant mess of an activity with her. It\u2019s not like you were complaining about something beyond her control (ie: babies crying and normal kid behavior). Traditional coloring sheets, mess-free crayola crafts, countless iPad activities, stuffed animals, the options go on and on. \n\nI spend a lot of time advocating for kids existing in public as a nanny, and parents like this drive me absolutely crazy. They give everyone a bad reputation.", "\ud83e\udd23 \nDefinitely NTA!!! \n\nGlitter on an airplane, what was this woman thinking?? \n\n(I\u2019m not be the best person to weigh in on this one, I think all kids on flights should be given a sleeping pill)", "NTA. Glitter on a plane is a terrible idea, and I think having a flight attendant handle it was better than confronting the glitter family yourself. IMHO, mom and the flight attendants who did nothing to stop the verbal harangue are the AHs here.", "NTA\n\nI'm non-confrontational too, and I would have been so scared sitting next to someone who's yelling and cursing at me. I'm surprised the flight attendant didn't do more to diffuse the situation if one passenger was yelling at another one.", "NTA It's insane how entitled so many parents are. They act like the world revolves around their child and they care nothing about how strangers may be negatively impacted. \n\nIt's great she wanted to keep the child occupied,  but glue sticks and glitter? Seriously? Not only was it inevitable that this would get on whomever the child was sitting near, this also created a hellacious mess for the cleaning crew to deal with. I bet glitter is right up there with vomit for them. \n\nThe mother was totally inconsiderate. You did absolutely nothing wrong and I hope it didn't take too long to de-glitter yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou don't get to impose yourself or your child on everyone else. Don't give me that \"You don't understand kids\" bullshit. My mother has been flying transcontinental with young children since her oldest was 4. Never has she thought it necessary to bring an activity that gets everywhere onto the flight. A colouring book and some pencils? Maybe. Some headphones and something to play music with? Sure. Modern parents have the advantage of better tech like tablets, cellphones and those magnetic quick erase boards to entertain their children with. You don't get to inconvenience others just because you can't be arsed.", "NTA. Not entirely sure anyone would vote for something else. Sure you want your kid entertained but there's a million things OTHER than glitter. That shit gets EVERYWHERE.\n\nMom should have known better.", "NTA.\n\nThank you for *Glitter Godzilla* and the late-night snort laugh it caused", "Well you would have looked like you came from a strip club covered in glitter\u2026still, NTA LOL", "Oh, glitter. The herpes of craft supplies.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Listen. I love glitter, I want to sparkle all the time.  I would bath in glitter if it wasn\u2019t so bad for everything.  HOWEVER, glitter crafts are not for public.  It is the herpes of craft supplies and should be kept at home where everyone consents to being covered in glitter.  You did nothing wrong.  That mother was a giant entitles asshole.", "Hi OP and dear me I am sorry that your flight got glittered (no pun intended here). Anyway NTA and you deserve to have peace and quiet mess free time on a flight. The mum should have left the glitter at home", "NTA Glitter is Satan's spittle.  The bows on my granddaughter's table decorations had glitter.  It's now one end of our home to the other and on the patio and on the dogs.  It's been three days and I still can't get it all up.  Vacuumed, mopped, repeated.  Used a leaf blower outside.  It's still everywhere.  Ugh!", "NTA. Another entitled 30-something mother\u2026. Shocking. You were discrete which is appropriate. She had no right to call you names. Really getting tired of parents these days calling people child-haters while they let their children act as a nuisance to other adults.\nYou sound like you were incredibly tolerant, OP.", "Probably an unpopular take, but if you only just glanced at the mother and didn\u2019t speak to her, ESH. She definitely is an asshole, and the bigger one in this story, don\u2019t get me wrong. It doesn\u2019t hurt to try to come to an agreement (kid can craft just not with glitter) before asking for assistance.", "ESH- yeah you were kinda an ass OP, like glitter sucks but would you rather the kid kick and scream the whole flight. Pick your battles man, throw your clothes in the wash after you land. You\u2019re acting like everyone will make fun of you for having glitter on you when you\u2019d step off the plane. \n\nThe mom also is an ass for bringing glitter on a plane.. that shit is messy as hell but she was trying to keep her kid occupied and quiet for everyone else\u2019s sake. Personally I\u2019d take being covered in glitter over listening to a screaming kid for hours on a cramped flight. But you do you", "ESH \n\nThe mom was doing her best to keep her kid entertained on the flight. Had the kid been screaming or disruptive because they were bored the whole time, you\u2019d complain about that too. \n\nMom could have chosen a better activity but I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve also never traveled alone with a young child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
