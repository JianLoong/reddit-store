She deserved to be called out. Having a kid doesn't mean you get to impose their messes on anyone else. The kid should have also been in the window seat.", "NTA\n\nIf even a *few* pieces of glitter work their way into the plane's avionic systems, the **entire flight is coming down**.\n\n... I mean, probably not, but that's what you say to the kid with a deathly serious face.", "I'll be honest, I laughed so hard at your description of this glittery hellscape that I woke up the entire house. You're hilarious.  \n\n\nNTA. Full disclosure, I'm a two-brained creature depending on my level of anxiety for the day, so frankly I might have just stowed my bag up somewhere and participated in the glitterpocalypse, but you are absolutely in no way the asshole for not wanting glue and glitter damage to your belongings. The mother is absolutely off her gourd for A) bringing *glitter onto a plane, who does that* but also B) reacting in such an overwrought rude way to being asked to maybe not detonate a glitter mine on a packed plane. There are so many art projects one can bring on a plane to entertain a child. Only an extremely entitled mother would think that glitter is acceptable in transit, either for the passengers or for the poor attendants that have to clean that out of the carpet and seats later. You handled it like a champ and were extremely polite. Don't worry about it, seriously.", "NTA. A plane is not a child's classroom. Of course, it's not always easy to entertain children on planes. But if you bring arts and crafts, it shouldn't be anyone else responsibility but the parents to clean it up, and they shouldn't be surprised if people are put off it.\n\nGiven her actions, she's just selfish and inconsiderate of others around her.", "NTA. While it's excellent for parents to keep their kids occupied on planes and bring things for them to do, they should also make sure the activities aren't going to be too bothersome or messy for other passengers or the flight crew. Glue and glitter aren't appropriate crafts for a plane ride.", "NTA\n\nI'm a mom. Who the fuck brings glitter on a plane? Even if you're adamantly against screens there's a TON of other things that don't involve thousands of tiny sparkly things that inevitably get everywhere.

What kind of psycho would bring this on a plane?", "NTA- You're taking public transportation, so unfortunately, this comes with the territory. Terrible parenting all around, that sucks, dude.", "NTA not in the slightest. Glitter is barely containable indoors, let alone a plane! The mom was the only AH. Accountability is rare these days. Stickers are the same price as glitter and they\u2019re just as fun.", "NTA \n\nThere are lots of ways to entertain kids on flights that aren\u2019t hugely disrespectful to the flight staff and the passengers around you. That mother didn\u2019t need to bring a giant mess of an activity with her. It\u2019s not like you were complaining about something beyond her control (ie: babies crying and normal kid behavior). Traditional coloring sheets, mess-free crayola crafts, countless iPad activities, stuffed animals, the options go on and on. \n\nI spend a lot of time advocating for kids existing in public as a nanny, and parents like this drive me absolutely crazy. They give everyone a bad reputation.", "\ud83e\udd23 \nDefinitely NTA!!! \n\nGlitter on an airplane, what was this woman thinking?? \n\n(I\u2019m not be the best person to weigh in on this one, I think all kids on flights should be given a sleeping pill)", "NTA. Glitter on a plane is a terrible idea, and I think having a flight attendant handle it was better than confronting the glitter family yourself. IMHO, mom and the flight attendants who did nothing to stop the verbal harangue are the AHs here.", "NTA\n\nI'm non-confrontational too, and I would have been so scared sitting next to someone who's yelling and cursing at me. I'm surprised the flight attendant didn't do more to diffuse the situation if one passenger was yelling at another one.", "NTA It's insane how entitled so many parents are. They act like the world revolves around their child and they care nothing about how strangers may be negatively impacted. \n\nIt's great she wanted to keep the child occupied,  but glue sticks and glitter? Seriously? Not only was it inevitable that this would get on whomever the child was sitting near, this also created a hellacious mess for the cleaning crew to deal with. I bet glitter is right up there with vomit for them. \n\nThe mother was totally inconsiderate. You did absolutely nothing wrong and I hope it didn't take too long to de-glitter yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou don't get to impose yourself or your child on everyone else. Don't give me that \"You don't understand kids\" bullshit. My mother has been flying transcontinental with young children since her oldest was 4. Never has she thought it necessary to bring an activity that gets everywhere onto the flight. A colouring book and some pencils? Maybe. Some headphones and something to play music with? Sure. Modern parents have the advantage of better tech like tablets, cellphones and those magnetic quick erase boards to entertain their children with. You don't get to inconvenience others just because you can't be arsed.", "NTA. Not entirely sure anyone would vote for something else. Sure you want your kid entertained but there's a million things OTHER than glitter.

The herpes of craft supplies.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Listen. I love glitter, I want to sparkle all the time.  I would bath in glitter if it wasn\u2019t so bad for everything.  HOWEVER, glitter crafts are not for public.  It is the herpes of craft supplies and should be kept at home where everyone consents to being covered in glitter.  You did nothing wrong.  That mother was a giant entitles asshole.", "Hi OP and dear me I am sorry that your flight got glittered (no pun intended here). Anyway NTA and you deserve to have peace and quiet mess free time on a flight. The mum should have left the glitter at home", "NTA Glitter is Satan's spittle.  The bows on my granddaughter's table decorations had glitter.  It's now one end of our home to the other and on the patio and on the dogs.  It's been three days and I still can't get it all up.

She definitely is an asshole, and the bigger one in this story, don\u2019t get me wrong. It doesn\u2019t hurt to try to come to an agreement (kid can craft just not with glitter) before asking for assistance.", "[deleted]", "ESH \n\nThe mom was doing her best to keep her kid entertained on the flight.

But, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to suggest a step before escalation. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree, she sucks as a mom, what\u2019s your point, I\u2019m pretty confused.. \n\nMy take wasn\u2019t that he was solely an ass, everyone sucked in that situation, which is why I said ESH.", "I'm amazed that the flight attendants didn't do anything. You are being harassed by a passenger, it's on them to sort that out. They can't just shrug it off.", "Yeah, and that woman did that to every passenger and flight crew that use the plane after.", "Of gosh no! Yeah I would only allow that stuff with responsible kids at best in an outdoor setting.", "Yup, we have no glitter, no play dough, no slime rules around here. I love that for them at school, but not in my home, let alone on a plane!!", "What\u2019s this \u201cclean up crew\u201d you speak of? Those people do not exist for airplanes. #DirtyBird", "How true!  I often get a few Christmas cards that have glitter as embellishments and they immediately go into the recycling bin.  Glitter just never goes away\u2026..", "Ha! Was thinking the same thing", "No I guess it is out of place but just shared my experience :)", "Welcome to the gullible club!", "He was absolutely right to approach the flight attendant when the mother showed zero intent on stopping her child from throwing glitter around. It's the entitlement of the \"this is how it is\" attitude that makes her and only her TA. I've had kids accidentally spill their drink on me and it wasn't an issue because those things can happen. However, if the kid was periodically spilling their drink into my lap and all I got from the parents was a shrug you better believe there'd be an issue. See the difference?", "But.... The kid *did bother* other people. OO is other people. OP was bothered. I have a 4 year old and consider myself to be very patient, and I would have been bothered if another person gave their kid gitter on a flight and I got it all over myself.\n\nPersonally, I'd be responsible enough to keep the glitter for not on the flight or airport. \n\nI went on many flights as a child and never needed glitter. Quite toys, a coloring book and markers and a bunch of snacks was more than enough to occupy me on long flights.", "The AirPod Max (Apple over the ear headphones) also have really good noise canceling, though they cost even more.", "Also, window seats for kids makes them happier, which in turn makes everyone on the flight happier. They love to look out and see take off the plane in the air, etc. not to mention not bothering anyone next to them while they are still developing manners. We all know this as parents. We also know the issue with glitter. This woman is insane.", "See?  She was not only a crazy b**** but also a selfish b**** by putting her daughter in the middle seat with all that shit to get strewn all over their seat mate.  Sooo inconsiderate.", "I\u2019m not trying to change your mind bro, you were the one trying to change mine.. otherwise why even comment with an argument? Get lost.", "The difference is you\u2019re being petty over the second one because of your opinion on the parent. Making a mountain out of a molehill is why I think that OP sucked too, it\u2019s glitter.. it\u2019s harmless. He was just being petty because he was mad at the mom. \n\nIf that mom had been nice and apologized to him for everything I doubt he\u2019s have ever told the flight attendant. So to me his action was driven out of petty revenge..", "INSANE. As soon as I read the title and saw the word glitter, I knew it was NTA, I don\u2019t even care what happened.", "As a mom to a toddler, I second this comment. And also, glitter is banned in our home. I think I heard it called the herpes of the arts and crafts world. I agree. Some relative brought a glittered gift bag to my kid's birthday party and it wasnt even a lot. It showed up everywhere. On our plates, chairs, bookshelves high or low, in the folds of my baby's elbow and once at the corner of his eye which turned out to be the unseen culprit of why that part of his eye was red all the time. Years later, I'm still finding glitter and if I look at it wrong, it disappears again, waiting to reappear somewhere more inconvenient. Whoever invented glitter should apologize to mankind.", "He didn't make a mountain out of a molehill, he asked a flight attendant to discreetly ask the woman to stop her kid playing with glitter which everyone agrees he shouldn't habe been doing in the first place. If the guy blew up and called her names (like she did the rest of the flight) you'd have a point.", "[It was Demitri Martin who called it that! ](https://youtu.be/Z0l6NR_BKuk)\ud83e\udd23", "I know it as fairy herpes. Once it touches you, you'll spread it everywhere.", ">I think I heard it called the herpes of the arts and crafts world.\n\nThis is *hysterical*! Definitely adding this to my permanent memory banks.", "Agree to disagree. But thanks for your input. It all seems to petty for me. But that\u2019s my opinion and you\u2019re allowed to have yours too.", "I don't see letting people walk all over you as a valid solution so yes, we're certainly going to disagree on that. Have a good one."]}
