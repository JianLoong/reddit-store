Jane is very different to our family and grew up in a less privileged household. Her family also doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas as part of her religion. Christmas is a pretty big event at my house and we host a big Christmas party every year. I didn\u2019t invite her over for Christmas as she doesn\u2019t celebrate and I didn\u2019t have a gift and stocking prepared for her either. My son is extremely upset for not inviting her although she doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas but I thought it might\u2019ve been rude to invite her. However on Christmas Day, my son showed up with Jane at my house. I was quite shocked at her presence because my son didn\u2019t let me know and I didn\u2019t know she was coming. My son and I ended up having a heated argument and he told me that I should\u2019ve invited her out of respect for their marriage. But they got married 2 weeks ago and I planned my guest list for Christmas before Thanksgiving. Also, I\u2019ve been unsure whether to invite her as her family doesn\u2019t celebrate Western Christmas traditions. He should have told me before.\n\nEDIT: Jane was my son\u2019s mistress whom he left his last 6 year relationship for and the wedding plans were meant to be with the ex. I wasn\u2019t that close with Jane because of my close relationship with my son\u2019s ex. I didn\u2019t want to include this earlier for my son\u2019s privacy \n\nI have noticed a lot of hate comments under this post, but these really hurt my feelings.

But I'm atheist, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nIt's never rude to invite someone of another religion to a specific holiday. They can always decline an invitation if they are more orthodox but assuming that they won't attend (especially because you added that you liked your son's ex more) is rude af. \n\nAnd the main reason why you didn't invite her is not her religion - but that she was your son's mistress he cheated on his ex with. \n\nLong story short: YTA.", "YTA.\n\nShe's your DIL.

YTA", "Info - Do you really hate your DIL so much? \n\nYTA!

May be you should really start treating her like one.", "YTA\n\nI am seriously hoping this is a troll post because people are bored and hungover after the holidays. \n\nBut just in case... \n\nYou planned the guest list for Christmas before thanksgiving:- Surely you knew that your son would be getting married between planning the list and Christmas day so you would have know to include the newest member of your family?! \n\nWhat does Jane's less privileged background have to do with anything?\n\nDid you invite your son on his own and expect him to leave his wife alone?\n\nIf you were 'unsure' about whether or not to invite Jane, why didn't you ask your son in advance so you would know whether or not to invite her?

Jane is part of your family now. What's rude is excluding her.\n\nYou're expecting us to believe that you had no advance notice of their marriage or relationship and are so rigid and unwelcoming that you wouldn't get a stocking and gift for her?\n\nDon't be surprised if your Don goes no contact with you", "YTA\n\nIf you dont like his family thats fine.\n\nBut than also dont invite him anymore because its rude to invite only half the Family for those events.\n\n\nWhat would you think if your son would host Christmas and only invite your husband but not you?

You're not mentioning some surprise elopment, so the two week thing is a lousy reason.  You knew of her.  Thinking it would be rude to invite her also seems like a very poor excuse - she can always turn down an invite but to not invite her, if you expected your son and it's a large family gathering, is going to be obviously excluding her.  If you were that concerned, you'd have simply asked if she wanted to be there.  It is fairly obvious you don't want her there, rather than this being some sort of cultural respect.  Pointing out that her family was \"less privileged\" also seems pretty toxic -  it has even less to do with anything than her religion/culture.  Broke people can still have and appreciate family gatherings and holidays, even if they aren't extravagant.", "YTA for this fake as hell post. Someone who would actually do this knows darn well that they\u2019re doing this intentionally because they don\u2019t like the new wife. \n\nThey might lie to their son saying they \u201cdidn\u2019t mean any harm\u201d but they wouldn\u2019t spend time trying to convince strangers online.\n\nBetter luck next time, Liz.", ">these really hurt my feelings.

He is not going to accept this behaviour from you.", "YTA they were together before they got married so you had ample time to put together at least a small gift/stocking. \nAnd why are you  surprised by your NEWLYWED son wanting to bring his new spouse to a holiday gathering?!?\n\nI get the impression you do not like Jane or accept her as a member of the family.", "YTA and also funny. Rude to your DIL but at the same time telling us to be kind to you. Doesn't feel good, does it?", "YTA- this has nothing to do with the new wife not celebrating Christmas. You just used that as an excuse to hurt her and exclude her from your family. She was the mistress and because you don\u2019t want to blame or exclude your son for his part in the ending of his last relationship, you have decided you are going to put all the blame on the new wife\u2019s shoulders. \n\nIf you accept your son into your life and forgive him for being a cheater then you must also forgive and accept the new wife. Because, let\u2019s face it, your son is the person who cheated on his partner.

In our family, most of us are Christian.  Some atheist.  Some Jewish.  We all come together at Christmas and exchange gifts.  We all enjoy Christmas, regardless of faith or lack of faith.  We all respect each other's beliefs.  And yet we all have a blast at Christmas, which we refer to as \"Christmas\".  \n\nSome are under the impression that Christmas must be a Christian religious celebration, as the modern version is supposed to celebrate the birth of Christ.  But that's not the true meaning of Christmas.  In fact, the church tried to ban and/or destroy Christmas because (in its original form) it had no connection with Christ or anything else related to Christianity.  But pagans kept celebrating it, so the church decided \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\"\n\nAnd that is how a pagan celebration came to be thought of as being associated with Christ somehow.  The holiday was co-opted by the church.\n\nThere's a saying \"KEEP CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS\".  But that's backwards.  It should read, \"Keep your god out of our Saturnalia\"\n\nWhat we refer to now as \"Christmas\" was a holiday that started roughly 200 years before Christ is said to have been born.  And it was a holiday that was so popular that even THE CHURCH COULD NOT QUASH IT.  (but they tried hard)\n\nAt it's heart, Christmas is about celebrating love of family and friends.  To specifically exclude your son's wife makes you grinch number one of all time.", "YTA\n\nthat was very rude. \n\nThis works both ways she now knows where she stands with you and your family.\n\nYou have just caused your Son a world of pain which he will eventually cut contact with you over.

Why don\u2019t you like her?", "YTA. You should've asked your son about whether or not to invite her and not just assume you know the answer.

We had met them once in our lives, but a friend of our kids is welcome in our home. No backstory needed. \n\nYTA. They got married 2 weeks ago. Plenty of time to add a place at the table.

That's a pretty lousy (and unchristian) thing to do to your son's wife - I'm sure her feelings were hurt by your actions.

When feeding the five thousand, he did not ask who the people were. All were fed. At different times, Jesus ate with sinners, tax collectors, Pharisees, and prostitutes. He instructed his followers that when they have a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame and the blind. You have ignored all of his teachings because your daughter in law might use the wrong fork.\n\nYour argument that they only got married two weeks ago so did not have time to buy a present or stocking is pathetic.

Jane is very different to our family and grew up in a less privileged household. Her family also doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas as part of her religion. Christmas is a pretty big event at my house and we host a big Christmas party every year. I didn\u2019t invite her over for Christmas as she doesn\u2019t celebrate and I didn\u2019t have a gift and stocking prepared for her either. My son is extremely upset for not inviting her although she doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas but I thought it might\u2019ve been rude to invite her. However on Christmas Day, my son showed up with Jane at my house. I was quite shocked at her presence because my son didn\u2019t let me know and I didn\u2019t know she was coming. My son and I ended up having a heated argument and he told me that I should\u2019ve invited her out of respect for their marriage. But they got married 2 weeks ago and I planned my guest list for Christmas before Thanksgiving. Also, I\u2019ve been unsure whether to invite her as her family doesn\u2019t celebrate Western Christmas traditions. He should have told me before.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Plenty of time to adjust or grow a spine tell your son that you are severely disappointed with him and that you don't know his wife and Christmas (in your opinion) it's not the moment you are willing to start this relationship. Was the ex there? Is that what got you so anxious and clutching your pearls? You should own up to the fact that you are embarrassed by your son. That him cheating on this girl you liked (that probably is from the same financial circle you guys are) and marrying a poor mistress from a different culture was not something you wanted to rub on your friends faces because it was embarrassing the heck out of you.", "You\u2019re the asshole, a not very nice one either.", "I don\u2019t celebrate Xmas on the 25th, my husband celebrates other holidays that I didn\u2019t know about but we have small celebrations as it\u2019s a day off and my mother-in-law always invited me to all the holidays. I don\u2019t think it was ever a question. \nI\u2019m also from less privileged background but I have the cheer to celebrate holidays and buy gifts \ud83d\ude01\n\nSo I can understand why your sun is upset with you.", "Yes, very much so.

Your son has every right to be upset. If you were unsure whether to invite her you would have asked your son instead of blaming him for not telling you. I doubt it crossed his mind that his wife would not be invited to a family gathering seeing as she is part of the family.  \n\n\nSounds like you don't like her because she doesn't come from the right background, doesn't have the right colour skin and is the 'wrong' religion.

So your excuse of \"they just married 2 weeks ago and the guest list was ready\" is not valid: she should have been on even before marrying. I don't think he met her on Thursday, got engaged on Friday and married her Saturday, so she must have been around for a longer period. And how difficult can it be to adjust the guest list? And if you were unsure about her celebrating Christmas, would it not have been a logical thing to either ask her or otherwise your son how they felt about it? You did everything to make her feel unwelcome. But I think I know the reason why you got out of your way to exclude her and why you were \"shocked\" by her showing up: it's because she has a different religion and comes from a less privileged household, right?
