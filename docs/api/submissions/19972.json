You nephew is picking up those phrases about your son from someone.  I\u2019m not  a betting person but I\u2019d bet it\u2019s from your sister. Becoming godmother may require you to be in their presence more often thus putting your son in harms way.", "You asked the wrong question. This has nothing to do with the 3-month-old. Your question should be, \"Should I srop having my nephew over to play with my son until he is better behaved?\"", "\"Her son has a habit of pushing and hitting my 3 year old.

It might not be from her, so I\u2019d start by just opening the dialogue, & asking if she\u2019s noticed he is saying things like these? \n\nThis could be something he has picked up from other kids at nursery, or something he saw on tv that he shouldn\u2019t have seen, so at this point I don\u2019t feel like there is enough info to make a judgement.\n\nA while back I remember seeing some teachers bringing a group of young children as a group outing, & I was shocked to hear what these adults were saying to these children! Shouting & swearing at these kids, who weren\u2019t even misbehaving. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t heard it myself.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it hasn\u2019t come from your sister, but I\u2019d rule it out before making any rash decisions. She might find it just as upsetting if you explain why you don\u2019t want your children playing together so long as he is behaving like this. She might not have picked up on this yet. If she is onboard, it could be the quickest way to try to correct this early, for you to be able to actively work together on this.", "Lol\nHe called your son a B!

He wants the acknowledgement.\n\nYour sister, needs to figure this out.\n\nYou as the adult should help if you care.\n\nA 3yo being able to call someone a B** openly around another adult is already a bad sign of obvious neglect.\n\nYour situation sucks though.", "I think there are bigger issues here than whether or not you're going to be her child's godmother. A 3 year old child should not be saying any of the things that your nephew had said to your son. You're right that he hasn't come up with these words by himself but you can't just jump to the conclusion that he's learned them from your sister.\n\nWho usually looks after him? Your sister? Is his father in the picture? Do grandparents watch him often, or childcare? \n\nThis little boy is hearing these things somewhere and this is super wrong and damaging. You do need to have an honest conversation with your sister about this before you can go any further. What happens next will really depend on her reaction to what you tell her.\n\nGood luck, and please try not to let this harm your relationship with your nephews - sounds like they need good people in their lives.\n\nSo, NTA but this really isn't about the godmother thing.", "YTA for not talking to your sister about this. It's much more likely he's repeating stuff from the playground than things she's saying to him about your son.", "ESH, aren't either of you going to do something about the real problem, which is to show your nephew that his behavior is not acceptable?", "... have you spoken to your sister about how her son behaves and why it's a problem? My instinct is that you have not, because she's been a bully all her life and he learned it at her knee so you don't think saying anything will help. \n\nIf you've never been able to stand up for yourself with her, it's time to put on your big girl pants on behalf of your kids. \n\nYour new nephew is a red herring.

I'd be concerned that a child that young is cussing and acting that way. Is that kid OK? Where is he learning that kind of behavior?

Its really obvious that if the 3yo is being taught this, eventually the 3 month old will learn it too.\n\nNTA\n\nI would hate to see ending being a godmother but you should definitely make it clear to your sister that her 3yo son's behavior is 100% unacceptable and very concerning and also very, very telling about the behavior of her other son who will also learn the same very bad behaviors.", "You need to address it with your sister.\n\nThis child didn't learn these things by himself. It may well be that it is not your child being called names but someone else. But whatever, this child is hearing these things and then repeating them. And his behaviour already  is bullying.

And she\u2019s okay with her son repeating these things? Wow. Hypocrite. You\u2019re NTA but I do think you need to stop letting them play together. It\u2019s not fair on your son.", "YTA. You are welcoming a child into your home to come hit, push, and bully your three-year-old child. You are his mother!! You are supposed to protect him from this!! Instead you are welcoming this behavior into the house!! Until your nephew understands that what he has said and done is wrong and that he needs to apologize, he should not he let into your house.", "Nta because your appropriately aren\u2019t blaming the nephew. Talk to your sister now if wait. She may take the decision out of your hands. But it sounds like your nephew is going to be needing your family in his life tbh.", "As to the question at hand- NTA.  Godparent is a religious position.  A godparent is supposed to ensure the child is raised in the religion and follows its precepts.  It\u2019s not supposed to be an honorary aunt or uncle position.  Admittedly you are no religious.  Moreover, you are clearly not in a position to encourage your sister to practice the religion of your family - nephews comments reflects a household which does not show respect for Creator\u2019s children.  (On related note, your nephew is a bully with a bad mouth after 3 years of life.  This is coming from your sisters house and victimizing your child, repeatedly.  You are failing yourself and most importantly your child by permitting this to continue.  DO NOT LET THIS CONTINUE.  You must be your child\u2019s protector.  Step up.  Stand up.  Shut this down.)", "NTA. You definitely need to address this issue with your sister because her son is being abusive to yours. YWBTA to your son if you don\u2019t handle this situation immediately.

I don\u2019t think I would ever be able to trust her. Or want that kind of close relationship.", "Valid. I have realised recently that I am a people pleaser. And I find it hard to create boundaries. I\u2019m slowly working on it. I\u2019m not proud to admit that I let these types of things go without being properly addressed.", "This! The fact that a 3 (!!!) Year old is saying this is very concerning. Someone is using this language in front of him, likely along with the aggressive behavior he's exhibiting with your son. You know its likely that nephew is being told he's a little batch or wuss too. I would be very concerned if I heard my 15 yo nephew using this language with my kids.\nI kinda feel like yta for not immediately addressing this with your sister.", "He doesn\u2019t go to play group, or day care, or anything like that.

My family are Greek Orthodox and we have all been baptised. I choose not to practice my religion. \n\nCan you explain why you think I don\u2019t know what a god parent is?", "I step in at all times. I don\u2019t know if I feel like putting in extra effort into what my sister feels is important when the she doesn\u2019t have a basic level of care when it comes to what I think is important.

You might surprise yourself.", "I hear you, but this is your son. How did he feel when hear sees this kid coming in?", "Yes! I mean, he is 3, he's certainly not getting these words out on the street or with coworkers.

Because if you are, that's a HUGE problem.", "Nothing age appropriate uses those terms with such repetition that a 3yo could understand and express.  This is coming from home.  They are raising a bully.  Do not let that kid near yours.  Be a parent.  Don\u2019t put your kid in that situation.

It\u2019s a huge problem no matter what. In this case it is a huge problem for me though, because the chances of him hearing that language from my sister is higher. And that makes me upset for multiple reasons.", "That's not true.  I'm godmother to several kids and I'm certainly not the one they would go to if the parents passed (this has been confirmed by the parents).\n\nEta: I'm godmother entirely in a religious sense.

I needed to hear all this!", "Literally a quick google search of \"are godparents legal guardians\" debunks that. Agreeing to be a godparent is not a legally binding event. It is 100% religious. Whether someone does take it into a legal sense is up to them (the parents and possible GP), but in general its not agreeing to be a legal guardian. Even if it was taken into a legal sense, a whole of legal stuff would need to be done for courts to even consider leaving an orphaned child to someone.", "Nope.  Especially in Greek Orthodox.  My cousins are Greek Orthodox and all three have different godparents, none of which are my mom because she\u2019s not Greek and can\u2019t be one. However if something were to happen to my aunt and uncle, my mother would take over guardianship.  A godparent is literally all about religion", "> *god*mother\n>\n> nothing to do with religion", "Wrong.  Godparent is not a contingent guardian to be appointed by court.  Godparent is religious mentor/supervisor who participates at ceremony and commits that child will be raised specific religion.  Not an honorary aunt or uncle.", "I\u2019d be abandoning the level of relationship I have now with my sister in general. I deserve better, and so do my kids.", "I don't get it. The nephew who insulted her son is not the one she is the godparent. How is she abandoning guidance here?", "You are correct, it's up to the parents, my husband and I are godparents in the guardianship sense while many of the people around us are godparents in the religious sense."]}
