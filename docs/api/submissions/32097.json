I was already getting annoyed with having to go to his home every weekend cause their living accommodations are significantly worse and I hate having to drive 45 minutes and not be able to hangout with my friends over the weekend cause its either to far away or because my fathers home is a tiny 2 bedroom apartment I also don't get along well with his new wife.\n\nSo I asked my mom if it was possible to get the custody agreement changed if she didn't want to be paying child support anymore and I didn't want to be going there every weekend if there was something that could be done. So like a buncha legal things later I got to tell a judge I didn't want to live with my dad on the weekends because the living conditions were significantly worse and that I didnt get along with his new fam.\n\nSo I dont know the exact details but I only see him once a month now which is fine cause he was never really home when I had weekends with him. The child support was also cut down significantly I dont know the exact number but my mom bought me a new car(I ruined my old one cause a guy was speeding through a yield sign and hit the side of it and bent the frame) with the extra cash she was saving so pretty cool.

Your dad isn't mad that he isn't seeing you, he's mad the money stopped flowing. \n\nIf nothing else, if you're old enough for your opinion to be taken into account, you can't be that far off aging out and him being cut off anyway. If he didn't have a plan for this, it's all on him.\n\nYou did what was best for *you*, which happened to benefit your mom. Your dad should be wondering why one of his kids hates spending time at his place so much, not blaming you for him and his wife failing to provide for their own kids.", "Nta. It sounds like your mom was taking care of your most of the time and on top of that paying child support. That\u2019s fucked", "NTA but am I am a bit confused though. I thought child support went from the parent with less custody to the parent with more custody. Why was the parent with weekend custody getting money from the one with primary custody, and especially why is he getting anything now with 1 day a month from the parent with 29-30/days a month?", ">I only see him once a month now which is fine cause he was never really home when I had weekends with him\n\nHe had weekend custody and couldn't even manage to be present? And he didn't have the excuse of working to not be there for you.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the child support will be ending soon when you become an adult, and as you are driving I assume that's not far off. **He** failed to plan for the ending of the child support. Especially as he only had you on weekends, so had no reason not to have a job for all those years.", "NTA\n\nYour Dad thought he had life on easy street.  Maybe his lazy ass should have been working instead of coasting.  My guess is he'll be single again soon.", "NTA\n\nChild support is meant to, well, support the child it's about. It's not meant to fund a persons personal life. If your dad depends on child support for you to fund his lifestyle, that's on him and not on you", "Nta.\n\nUnless you never fully developed and became independent, child support has an expiration date. \n\nThe responsibility of providing for the family belongs to the parents. Your father and his partner need to provide for their family. \n\nYou're driving, so about 16y? His time getting child support was more than enough to get him on his feet  while getting an education or job experience.", "NTA. child support is for u to be taken care of, not to support someone who refuses to work. i\u2019m sorry ur relationship w ur father is this way, but honestly sounds like laziness and a lack of care for his children. i\u2019m sure his new wife and kids don\u2019t love that living condition either.", "NTA. Your dad's gravy train ended. That's is really sounds like he cared about.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s awesome.

You\u2019re almost 18 anyway so he should have already known the gravy train was leaving.", "NTA and your mom needs a better lawyer.", "NTA.\n\nIt is also a bit sad that the relationship to your father deteriorated so much :( but it sounds like it is his fault. He should not leech off his ex amd figure it out now.", "NTA hes been sponging off of your mom for years. Maybe this is something that should've been done sooner. I thin the support part should be completely abolished for your dad since it doesn't sound like hes contributed much at all. \n\nOn a side note, maybe his wife and him can get more stable job to afford their lifestyle? Thats ridiculous that hes mad at you.\n\nRe ruining your car, please please drive safely and also watch out for crazy ones as much as you can, if you see them speeding or not slowing down, even if your your right of way, let them have it, your safety is no1 priority. Its not always possible but being aware of your surroundings in a car is very important.

You are not responsible for your dad. You didn\u2019t force him to remarry and have two kids. He\u2019s the adult he should be responsible for you.", "NTA. If I understood correctly, your mom was paying your dad $ to make his home comfortable for you to visit. You were not there all that often, so he was freeriding at your mom\u2019s expense. \n\nThe money he was getting - to make you comfortable - paid for a 2 bedroom apartment. That\u2019s plenty for a parent and one child, maybe a bit tight for a parent, a stepparent, and one child but not comfortable for two adults, a teenager, and a baby. \n\nAt the point where you are not comfortable, the payments to your dad are not serving their intended purpose. \n\nYou are casting yourself as a villain here when your parent made the decision to change the situation he was getting free room and board to maintain. Worse, he\u2019s guilting you about and recruiting others to help him guilt you. \n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable and developmentally appropriate for you to want to spend more time with your friends. Custodial arrangements often change when kids reach your age. \n\nDon\u2019t let your dad manipulate you into supporting him. He is the parent. You are the child. It\u2019s his job to take care of you.

Your father certainly is, and you obviously know this. What you may want to think about is how your mum handled all of this.\n\nIt does seem like you were the one to put the idea forward, so she seems not to have been pushing for it which is good, but she should really have kept her opinions about subsidising your dad to herself, as it could have affected how you see the relationship with him.\n\nAdditionally, \"rewarding\" you with a new car for siding with her against your father is kind of uncool. \n\nNow, there are probably healthy explanations for all of this so i am not trying to tell you she's doing anything wrong, but know that you are allowed to have healthy relationships with both of your parents and neither of them should try to influence you in that regard, especially since you are now old enough that your opinion carries weight.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does he get spousal support from your mom?", "NTA. If you are already driving, that means that you will probably be an adult soon or maybe you already are. That means that child support will stop soon anyway. What was your dad planning on doing once your mother didn't have to pay child support anymore? He is the only AH in this story. Maybe the justice system too actually. Why did your mother have to pay so much child support when you were at her place more often anyway?", "I've checked and double checked, but i just can't seem to find a milligram of sympathy for your dad anywhere.

He has simply been using you as a paycheque so he didn't have to get a job.  70k is a lot.\n\nI am a bit confused though as to why you still stayed there when you were able to drive.  If you are old enough to hold a license then I think you are old enough to decide if you go there or not.  At most I would have popped over one morning for an hour or two, have a coffee then go home as 45 mins isn't all that far away in the greater scheme of things if it keeps the peace.", "NTA, especially because you are a kid and kids can't be assholes in their parents' divorces anyway, but you did nothing wrong.\n\nI'm glad you are out of a bad living situation. Your happiness is what matters most. If you were happier seeing your dad more, you should do that regardless of finances. If being over there feels uncomfortable, you deserve to do what is good for you.\n\nNow, for child support, that's not your job to worry about. However, if you were seeing your father more and your mother was paying support- that support is for YOU. It's for feeding and clothing and housing and caring for you, not his family.
