They called me gross and immature for talking about their bathroom habits.  \n\nI'm lost. They brought it up first.

There are plenty of signs in bathrooms, airbnbs, etc. in foreign countries saying don't put ANYTHING in the toilet, it is sure to clog, put the sh*t covered paper, in the basket, and you can still put some toilet paper in the toilet, and it doesn't clog.\n\nWhere they are the total a-holes is their absolute refusal to take responsibility for clogging the toilets. If I clogged a friend's toilet, even with no prior warning, even in the USA, even if I hadn't used much TP, I'd ask for the plunger and unclog it.
