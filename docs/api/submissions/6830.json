If you love someone who needs help, you\u2019re glad to help. Please leave this man: If he loved you helping you would make him happy, not furious and abusive. This behaviour could escalate and it sounds like you\u2019re vulnerable (given you need meds to drive etc.) if you have a degenerative illness, he could use withholding meds to \u2018punish\u2019 and control you when you can no longer get them yourself. Please don\u2019t let it get to that stage.", "That's no man.", "The older guys find these youngish girls & groom them. I've noticed a lot of that in this group. And they make excuses for the guys", "He is *eight years older than you* while you're in your 20s and barely an adult human being, and he's treating you like an inconvenience. Get out.", "I concur. If he gets angry, it is b/c he is with someone else, or wants to be. He is doing something baaaaad, and gets pissed off in contacted.", "oh shit just saw the age gap. If I was 27 and one of my friends started dating a 19 year old I'd be like \"....really bro? really?\" \n\n8 years isn't that big a gap eventually, but the difference between a 19 year old and a 27 year old is. No matter how mature the 19 year old is, I can't imagine dating one at 27+ no offense. I promise you if you end up not dating this guy, when you are 30 and look back at this age gap you will be like \"wtf was wrong with me for thinking he was worth dating?\"", "The reason he's not dating someone closer to his own age is because none of them are willing to put up with his bullshit.", "Being moody because of stress isn't a big deal. Not being self aware about it and taking it out on your girlfriend asking for meds is a huge deal. Sounds like he needs some emotional intelligence to deal with his stress.", "Exactly! Usually, if I do need meds picked up, and was unable to, my SO or parents would pick them up if they were on their way. It isn't hard. \n \nI feel bad for OP", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. Most people would treat a stranger who needed medicine better than your boyfriend treats you.", "NTA, your bf, the AH.", "NTA uh my boyfriend will pick up my meds no problem. \nMy ex husband will go get my meds for me any time I ask. Get rid of that man. I think anyone would pick up meds for someone if asked. Seems one thing people understand and are compassionate about is this\u2026.. except your bf\u2026.", "You realize he is abusive right? He is straight up making you feel like the bad guy for a necessary medication be could've easily grabbed. Now because of his actions, you are stuck for the night. NTA", "This isn\u2019t really about meds, this is about you being in a relationship with an uncaring asshole.\n\ndo yourself a favour and end this before you waste any more years of your life on him.  There are other nice caring single men out there, you don\u2019t need to settle for this one.\n\nAlso NTA", "NTA and does he act this way a lot?\n\nHe sounds like\u2026\u2026..A\u2026..LOT like HTA", "Please quit making excuses for him.  He's a grown adult who is treating another grown adult (YOU) poorly.  Taking a few extra minutes at the end of the day to pick up meds for a loved one really isn't a big ask.\n\nNTA for making a normal every day request from someone who supposedly cares about  you", "Unless there's much more to this story than you're telling, you're absolutely NTA. Picking up an RX for your partner is just part of being in a partnership. And it sounds like you needed your medication ASAP. You need to DTMFA.", "NTA\n\nAnd you're in an abusive relationship.  Dump this loser.", "Needs more info\n\nWhy did your boyfriend not want to pick up your meds? He might have a legit reason...\n\nAlso, is this a straight or homosexual relationship? If it is straight the pharmacy might not allow a man to pick up female-oriented medication", "NTA. Your boyfriend clearly doesn\u2019t care about your health, get away from him and SAVE YOURSELF", "Nobody wants to make stops on the way home after an exhausting day.

Do not under any circumstances have children with this man. Run.", "NTA, is there anything else he does/doesn't do that affects your health negatively and allows him unfettered control of your wellbeing?", "NTA! My husband regularly stops on his way home from work to pick up my asthma meds, and he does it without complaining, even though he's tired AF.\n\nYou picked a loser. Y T A to yourself if you stay with him.", "NTA. I pick up my wife\u2019s meds all the time. And remember this when he wants you to pick something up. As they say, Karma\u2019s a bitch.", "Has he always been a jackass?", "NTA", "If this is a one-off, then N T A.\n\nHowever, is it a one off? Or does he work and you don't? Is he often doing stuff like this for you? Is this part of a long pattern of you wanting him to do stuff for you?\n\nI feel with a lack of context, it's very hard to judge, I know from experience that this one favour is often not just one favour, it's a constant repetition and this one might have been the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nSo for me, this lacks INFO and no judgment can be given.", "NTA. I don't think this person is boyfriend material: While he may be a boy, he's certainly not a friend.", "INFO: Why couldn't you take an uber to get them? Or get them on *you*r way home?", "NTA. He\u2019s a jerk. My husband is always willing to pick up my meds if he\u2019s out and I\u2019m not. Don\u2019t be with someone who doesn\u2019t make your health a priority.", "NTA. Do yourself a favour and get out of that relationship.", "If no receipt, there is a bin out back", "I can't imagine they live so far from the pharmacy that it would even take thirty minutes for him to pick up the prescription on his way home. \n\nNTA, OP. Your boyfriend is willing to risk your safety by not getting your prescription AND by being willing to let you drive when it's not safe to do so (because you haven't had your prescription).", "I want to add to this, my husband works A LOT and it\u2019s a physical job. I tried to get my meds once but the line was really long and the kids were fighting and I just couldn\u2019t and came home.  I told him what happened and after work he went to get my meds for me.

He is a kind person and would NEVER treat her this way if she needed him to get something on the way home.", "It's the wait time at the pharmacy that adds up, I suspect.", "I hate working in the heat too, but \"moody\" shouldn't include \"refuses to pick up medically necessary prescriptions.\"", "I had that problem with my thyroid meds for a while because the manufacturer was having technical issues.

They kept saying, because your son is an adult, we can't give it to you. Maybe it was something like codeine..??"]}
