{"id": 28531, "submission_id": "173egnu", "title": "AITA for expecting my girlfriend to still do chores on her period?", "selftext": "I (27M) and my girlfriend (27F) started living together about 5 months ago. We'd been dating for about 6 months before that. She works from home. I have an office job. It's both our first time living full-time with an SO.\n\nNaturally, we've split the chores. For instance, I do all the dishes, hand-wash all the laundry (don't have a machine), mopping, and everything else involving soapy water because of her skin condition. She folds the laundry, does more of the cooking (not all), sweeps the floors, etc. This isn't an exhaustive list.\n\nOverall, I feel we have a good system. However, during her period, she just stops doing everything. I have to do everything for about 7-8 days, until she says her period is over.\n\nI understand some women have bad periods, other's don't. So, I might ask, \"Oh, did you forget to fold the laundry today?\" She'll reply \"I'm on my period, you do it.\" Then, I'll do it. Or, if we're running low on food, I'll say \"Heads up, you might have to make a grocery run tomorrow.\" She'll reply that she's on her period, so I have to go.\n\nBefore today, I'd not expressed any outward complaints. I'd done all the chores for both of us during her period for the past 5 months. However, I had begun internally questioning whether she really can't do *any* chores anytime she is on her period.\n\nI've asked if she gets cramps or has other physical symptoms. She said she doesn't get cramps. When I asked if she could describe specifically what she was feeling, all she could say was \"Hmm... I don't know, I just feel kinda weird and... yea.\" When I've asked if she might want to see a doctor, she replied, \"No.\"\n\nShe still goes to work (from home). She'll still come on our Sunday morning hikes (mountainous climb, ~5 miles round trip.) Though, we'll take a more leisurely pace. She'll still go to badminton with her girlfriends after work.\n\nIt seems that, other than chores, the only other things she'll refuse to do on her period is have sex, or eat ice cream/spicy foods. To be clear, I've never pressured her to do any of that when she doesn't want to, ever.\n\nToday, after our morning hike, I asked if she was feeling well enough to help clean the apartment after we had lunch. She said she couldn't because she was on her period. After lunch, she took a nap and, when she woke up, started watching a movie. I asked \"You sure you can't help me with any of this?\" And she said \"No, and I already told you why.\"\n\nTo be clear, I would have no issue if she was just declining to go out or something. But, it just don't see how her period physically affects her to the point she can't do household chores with me, given that we'd just come back from a 5 mile hike that morning.\n\nAITA? Am I just another ignorant man that doesn't understand what a period is? I'm hesitant how to address this because I know how people might react when they hear a man complaining about a woman's period.\n\n**edit**: I'm going to inquire whether there is some cultural thing going on. Before moving in with me, she still lived at home with her well-to-do parents, and they had an in-home maid/cleaning service. Also, she has told me about her cultural views on what a woman's role while pregnant/after giving birth (detailed below in a comment.)\n\nSuffice to say, I think there might be something cultural about doing \"labor\" vs \"recreation\" while she is on her period. I'll wait until she is done with her current period and ask about it at a neutral time.\n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1696811256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173egnu/aita_for_expecting_my_girlfriend_to_still_do/", "score": 661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But, before I jump to the \"She's lazy\" schtick, is it possibly a cultural thing? Some cultures will view a woman menstruating as \"unclean\".\n\nHowever, from your statements she's perfectly capable of going on a hike, so I seriously doubt that her period is debilitating in that respect. It's entirely possible that when she grew up her parents coddled her into the thinking that \"you can't do anything while you're on your period\" because in some families that was definitely a thing.\n\nThe above 2 statements were just me being devil's advocate as it were, not justifying her actions.  It could very well be that she IS lazy and milking it for what she can.\n\nUltimately, NTA for being a man who doesn't actually have a period, nor for asking questions when you don't know enough on the subject.", "\u201cIf you are well enough to hike or play badminton, I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t do chores. Can you explain it to me, because I truly can\u2019t understand where you\u2019re coming from and it is starting to frustrate me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s truly that simple. You are partners. If you can\u2019t talk about this, that\u2019s a huge problem. Because it sounds like she is manipulating you, and that is not ok.", "NTA\u2026. I could understand 1-2 days as I experience quite painful periods on the first day. But not the entire time. Unfortunately, the world doesn\u2019t stop for periods. Shit still needs to be accomplished. If she were living alone, I doubt she would let everything pile up for 7-8 days.", "NTA.  If she's hiking multiple miles and playing badminton on her period, she can basically do all the normal household chores.  \n\n\nI don't have terrible periods, but occasionally I will have a half day up to 2 days of just sitting on the couch with a heating pad.  Trust me, there's not even the most leisurely of walks happening during that time.", "I had horrible cramps as a teen - early adulthood. (Eventually found out I had endometriosis after they ran the pathology post hysterectomy). It used to only hurt incredibly bad the second day. As I got older / had kids etc it became worse and worse where the cramps would last much longer. I\u2019d want to cry or be balled up in bed on just the second day when I was younger and much longer when the spells got worse. I was definitely not out hiking or doing badminton. (Still had to mom when the kids were young too if no one else was around to help on those bad days.)\n\nSo I have sympathy for period cramps as they can be bad, gross, uncomfortable and sometimes just exhausting. However it doesn\u2019t sound like she has many of those issues if she is still doing normal activities and can\u2019t even fold laundry. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f NTA", "Your gf is either being lazy, or she needs to connect with a doctor. Either way, going on as is seems unacceptable and unfair. \n\nNTA. Periods can make you feel super shitty, and of course, healthy couples should be willing to pick up the slack when someone isn't well. But the expectation that you will routinely absorb 100% of the work is simply not sustainable. Even a week of this may sound short, but at the end of the week I'm sure you're exhausted. If you keep it up, you will burn out. \n\nYou need to address with gf that this is unfair, and maybe a different approach needs to be explored to divvy up responsibility. \n\nBut honestly, if she is well enough to hike, she is likely well enough to fold some laundry or sweep some floors.", "Nta,\n\nYour gf is using her period as an excuse. If she can go on a hike she can do chores. But just to give the benefit of the doubt, is it a cultural thing? That\u2019s the only other thing I can think of. Other then that I think it\u2019s time to sit her down and talk it out", "NTA\n\nShe's milking it!\n\nI get cramps, sometimes bloating, and I know some other women get back aches, possibly headaches, bloating etc. and there's a wide spectrum of how impairing a period is (either without any explanation, or because of a condition like PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, whatever). But I would say that overall, you learn to live with it with over the counter pain meds, just taking it easy or skipping very strenuous tasks. Sometimes someone with what is still considered a \"normal\" period might have to take one day off of work if it's real bad and I have heard stories of some women throwing up or passing out, but this is one anecdote in my own circle from when a girl was still a teen, I don't think it affected her after the first few years of having a period.\n\nI know everyone is different, but if she genuinely can't do any chores at all for 7-8 days every cycle, she needs to see a doctor. But you already know she's lying because she can still go hiking, work, and do badminton when she's on her period. No way that those activities are MORE strenuous than folding laundry or hoovering the house. On the few days in my life where my period was really bad, I was struggling to get through my day at school. No way would I still be volunteering to play badminton or go on a hike that I could skip.\n\nI would say \"Ok, so how long is your cycle? 28 days? Ok, since you are taking 7-8 days off of chores every cycle and expect me to do 100% of all the housework during that week, I will be taking 7-8 days off every 28 day period. I'll make sure to pick days when you are not on your period. You can then cover for me.\"\n\nHonestly, my friend, she's lazy and just milking it. The fact she can't even tell you what her physical symptoms/complaints are when she's on her period says it all: she's fine (aside from bleeding, which is still a nuisance and something to plan your life around), but she just doesn't want to do any chores.\n\nOn top of this, she's not offering to compensate. She's just telling you she isn't doing anything for that week and that it's all coming down to YOU to do all of the household stuff. Welcome to the rest of your life if you stay with this woman.\n\nThis kind of behaviour would be a dealbreaker to me. She isn't willing to do sh\\*t around the house if she can find a \"plausible\" excuse. And you're the doormat you lets her. Maybe come up with your own excuse like having sprained your thumb or having terrible back ache. See how long you can milk that for.", "NTA \n\nIf she can do fun very physical stuff, she can do un-fun house maintenance stuff. \n\nChart her 'periods' on your own phone calendar.  A few days before, suggest she plan ahead by doing everything possible (get groceries, prep meals, sweep, etc.).  Then you only do your part while she's \"not feeling well\".  Then after, she can pick up where she left off with her part of the housework.\n\nETA: I see another suggestion is that you cover for her, but take a week off from your own housework.", "I live by myself and when im on my period i dont want to do anything. Dishes will be in the sink, laundry will be unfolded, I just eat left overs or take out. All I want to do when I have my period is sleep and be in bed. I dont get crams often but other symptoms like extreme fatigue, bloating, headache, body pains will happen. Thank god I dont live with anyone because for 3-4 days all I do i lay in hed and watch netflix.", "Does she even have an SKIN CONDITION ?", "NTA - if she had any other symptoms maybe a different call. If she wanted to hang out and do nothing for a day max, ok as long as you don\u2019t have to pick up 100% of the slack. But she\u2019s okay to go hiking but not fold laundry? If you can sit up right and move your limbs without additional discomfort, you can fold laundry.", "She's pretty terrible. I would diplomatically, but firmly, discuss the issue with her. Try to be nice and calm, but this is not fair and it is perfectly reasonable for you to say, \"no, this isn't fair.\"\n\nIf that conversation doesn't go well, then you know exactly where you stand. She's not going to respect you or try to be fair.\n\nEDIT: also, bro... 27 is really old to be acting this way. I'd expect this shit out of like a 19 year old.", "NTA\n\nIf she is well enough to hike and play badminton, why are chores any different (in the physical sense)? I've known people who have a period knocks them down and they do need to spend time sleeping, or lying down with a hot towel/compress on their stomach. In those cases, they're pretty much unable to hike, or play badminton.\n\nShe even told you she doesn't get cramps, and her only reason was \"I feel weird\". TBH, it seems to me that she's just using it as an excuse to duck chores. I understand such may not be the case, but I'm kind of sensing she's being like my old room mate. My friends and I at one point lived with a roommate (F25) (this was a mixed-gender house rental run by an older couple that wanted to give a living space off campus to college students) that we had to kick out because she used her period as an excuse. She didn't want to do chore on her period, yet she'd be playing volleyball, and soccer with her friends (in a very physically exerting way). We had another roommate (F23) confront her about this, and to cut a long story short, we had to kick her out. The confronting roommate would get cramps, yet try to do what she can, even if it meant doing fewer chores or chores that didn't require much moving around, i.e. drying dishes.\n\nTry to see if she would rather do different chores on her period.\n\nHope this works out for you.", "If she can work, hike and play sports she can fold laundry", "God help you if she gets pregnant. This is lazy to me, we are adults and have to do hard things even when we are not feeling 100%. It\u2019s a red flag", "I can barely move on my cycle and she can do a 5 mile hike? Whew lmao. Clearly moving isn\u2019t an issue for her(walking to the car to sit, getting out to go to the trail and back) and playing badminton. NTA.", "NTA. You mentioned she is originally from China; I believe this to be a cultural thing. From what I\u2019ve read, menstruation in Chinese culture can be seen as \u201cunclean\u201d and women are forbidden from doing certain things during that time. She may just be following those traditions. I\u2019d suggest having a conversation with her about it to get better clarification on the matter.", "NTA. If she can do a long hike, she can do her chores. She even said she doesn't get cramps.", "NTA! And this coming from a woman. I use an implant to control my period and still get cramps but if this lady is seriously going on full blown hikes and going about life as normal, then she\u2019s milking it. Trust me it is time for a Come to Jesus moment with her. You\u2019re only six months in, she can either get off her ass and help or id part ways.", "NTA \n\nShe's lazy .", "NTA. If she can play badminton and go on a 5 mile hike she\u2019s perfectly capable of doing chores, she\u2019s just being lazy.

You said she was raised in China until she was 17. Fair warning, I'm white and American. But I recently learned a little bit about Chinese pre- & post-pregnancy confinement, and what you've described sounds like what I learned. In fact, there are women that their career is taking care of women during and after pregnancy. It's really interesting. I did a quick Google search and found several hits that describe what they do during a woman's period - no exertion, resting, no sweating, no cold. So she's not lying to you. I'd suggest talking to her more indepth, and learn more about it, so if you decide to stay with her you understand what the process is and why.

Bc me personally, my period would be so bad that I physically can not move without falling or vomiting. But that's not the case for her it seems. If it's not cultural, have a sit and find the root.

But, I'll say this, they take Midol or whatever helps,they work, as good team mates.Maybe when they get home they grab a heating pad and stretch out on the couch. As for it taking 7 full days, I had close girl friends, only one had 5 days, her flow was light, the rest of us had 3 maybe 4 days if heavy flow, then over, though we wore protection for safety.

Sad to say but we worked with a woman that battled horrible moods the week before her start date, knowing when it was coming we all attempted to ease her pain and stress. But, I think you are being abused here. She can play badminton but not fold laundry. Seriously,  I feel for you, she gets a week off every month. You are her trained Pet. I feel for you if you have children with her. I married a guy in 1979, he passed recently. We played our music loud. One ran the vac while the other shifted furniture, then one mopped, the other started laundry, one cooked, the other washed as the cooking was happening, dishwasher empty for final plates, we folded, hung laundry watching TV, together we changed the bedding, jumping on the fresh sheets laughing wrestling.

So I bet the father doesn't doo 100% of all the housekeeping and child care but that at least the grandmothers are expected and willing to help out, so that would be three adults who are taking care of one baby. If these grandmothers are keen to help out, the father could probably just continue his day job and then take over/help out in the evenings and weekends. But in the USA that just isn't going to be like that for most people. Many people become grandparents when they are still working, and in many case both the grand mother and grand father would have to work. So that grandparent support network that people might have in China (assuming this is talking about China) is probably much much smaller if not absent for many couples in the USA.\n\nI wouldn't agree to do 100% of the childcare and housekeeping immediately after the child is born (unless the woman was literally on death's door and has such a serious complication and such a rough recovery that she literally can't do anything but heal after the birth).

Ask if she likes having one week without any chores, because you would like that too, and that you guys can come up with a system where you each get a week off of chores and the other person does all the chores, and then after one week for her, one week for you, you guys have two weeks during which you share the chores 50/50.", "Ykw?
