The man who had been raising me as my father (54m) found out I was not his biological child (my two older brothers are) when I was 7 and promptly abandoned me and divorced my mom. He was very involved up until this point and was actually in the middle of coaching my soccer team when it happened. He abandoned that too and the assistant coach had to take over. Anyways. He ended up (not sure how) paying child support to my mom for me, probably because he was the breadwinner and him leaving my mom left us two in pretty dire financial circumstances. I was also yanked out of the private school my brothers and I attended. He remarried a few years later to a woman with a daughter a year younger than me and promptly did everything with her that he used to do with me. Hurrah for them. Sophomore year of highschool some organization was hosting a father-daughter dance in our school gym while I was around campus with some friends (can\u2019t remember) and we vandalized the fancy car he pulled up in.  Not something I\u2019m proud of but I\u2019m mentioning it here because although I paid for half the cost of repairs he graciously paid the other half and decided not to press charges.\n\nAnyways, now the old man has cancer,  both brothers and stepdaughter are out of state with school, and his wife has early arthritis or something, not really sure. He calls MY mom and asks her if either of us could drive him to and from chemotherapy! We were in the car and he was on speaker, so I told him no, that\u2019s something family does and he\u2019s made it very clear he doesn\u2019t see either of us as family and  hung up. \n\nMom is doing things like bringing casseroles and driving him. I don\u2019t try to stop her but I don\u2019t help her either. She has recently started to try and guilt me into it, saying:\n\n- He always payed child support, to which I said the amount of money he lost on that was about as impactful as a fart in the wind for ole moneybags \n- He didn\u2019t press charges about his car, to which I said great he did one nice thing for me, so he can get ONE casserole or ONE car ride. \n\nNow my siblings and his stepdaughter have all flown in and my brother says he (not dad) REALLY needs to speak to me. I said to tell him that if he has something to say to me I don\u2019t want to hear it and if he writes me a letter I\u2019m not opening it. I said I was sorry for what they were going through but that he\u2019s made it very clear I\u2019m not his family and so I don\u2019t want them asking me for things they would ask of family. However they\u2019re struggling and the more they ask for help the more my patience wears thin and the more insensitive my rejections get. My mother recently talked with me about \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d- AITA?

The man who had raised you as his own daughter, for seven years, suddenly dumped you. It was not your fault that your mother had cheated. You loved him as your father. He ripped away your security, your family, your lifestyle, and I am sure a good chunk of your heart.  That is not something that is easily forgiven. Maybe your mother is helping him because she still has some sort of sense of guilt. But that is not your guilt to carry. That man did you very wrong, and I wouldn't shed a tear when he died if I were you. \n\nI am sorry your brothers are suffering. It's understandable, they are worried about their father.  But he has not been a father to you for 15 years. By his own choice. How much is one child supposed to take? Not only did he withdraw his love and affection, but then he made you watch as he showered that attention on another little girl who was also not his child.  He seems to have no problem loving her.\n\nThe hurt and trauma he has caused you is not easily gotten over. It sucks that your mom is so quick to overlook the damage that was done to you in order to try to rehabilitate herself. It's not about being the bigger person. The injustices he did to you were inflicted on a child. He had the opportunity to do right by you and chose not to.  Your mom is infidelity was not your fault. The relationship you had established with him for seven years meant nothing to him. And now he means nothing to you. And that's OK.", "NTA. He clearly thought biology was more important than the years he had spent raising you that he left you immediately. \n\nI think it\u2019s ok to remind him that biology was crucial to him and so there\u2019s no reason he should need to speak to you now. Especially if it\u2019s going to cause you angst. Here he is, with cancer, and still finding ways to bring you pain. No sir\u2026.no thanks. Take a WHOLE seat sir.", "NTA. Your mom being nice to him makes a kind of sense. She cheated on him so she feels guilty for the fallout and divorce\n\nHowever you were blameless and he treated 7 year old you cruelly and your feelings are valid too. Perhaps try and explain it to your mom like that and see how she reacts?", "NTA, he burnt that bridge \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA- \n\n>My mother recently talked with me about \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d\n\nYou are already the bigger person by choosing to forgive your mother. The way you are acting is vengeful toward your not father, but not in any way out of line. From what we know you haven't gone out of your way to do anything harmful or manipulative, I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone calling you an AH.", "NTA, he made his choice when you were 7. I'd be going non-contact. You made your boundaries clear and they aren't respecting them. They don't deserve to have access to you. Your mother also needs to respect your boundaries. She was the one that had a relationship with him that she fucked up. You have no responsibility towards this man.", "NTA.  He abandoned you at age 7.  I\u2019m sorry.  That must have hurt like hell \n\nYou owe him nothing", "NTA. He decided it was a good idea to punish a 7-year-old child for something she didn't understand or have anything to do with. Then he decided that another little girl was more deserving of his love, affection, and guidance throughout her life than the one he raised from birth before abandoning. You do not owe him or his sons a single speck of dust, so don't feel guilty.", "NTA\n\nHe made his choice to be a monster and punish a SEVEN YEAR OLD for something she had no control over. The only father she\u2019d ever known, abandoned her just like that. \n\nYou owe him nothing.", "NTA - He could have stayed but he chose not to. Then proceed to actively stay out of you life till then.", "NTA. Keep doing as you are. HTA 1 million percent. He\u2019s not getting enough of what he deserves. I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you. What your mom did had NOTHING to do with you and you NEVER do anything like that to a child. Did your brothers ever acknowledge how awful he was to you and your mom? Did they ever stand up for you?

Stick to your guns.", "I think you should do whatever serves you best long term, OP.\n\nIf speaking to him will stir up hatred and hurt that you already laid to rest, you are right to protect those boundaries and stay away. There may be fallout with your brothers, especially as they grieve, but no one can reasonably expect a child who was discarded the way you were to put herself in a place of suffering again. If they can\u2019t understand that, then that is a limitation on their parts that you cannot control.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay if you decide you want to speak to him, but that is a decision that should be made solely by you and in the absence of guilt or pressure.\n\nEither way, do whatever sets you up to take the healthiest next steps in life.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t been in therapy yet, please go. You suffered some terrible trauma at your parents\u2019 hands and deserve to find healing from it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But, if he has something to say, and he has limited time to say \u2018it\u2019, your opportunity to be curious is limited. \n\nIf you feel conflicted, naturally due to the hurt you feel, then I would suggest that there will be an inevitable regret later in life that you never stepped in to offer support. I do not believe you are obligated, and other family members being mean is really not fair. \n\nA therapist would likely say \u2018you have control over your actions, and only you can judge the merit of those actions\u2019 - however much we might all struggle over what we perceive others think about us. Asking Reddit for an opinion, makes me curious about why this situation isn\u2019t more simply resolved for you. Your Mom is acting compassionately, perhaps reflecting her affection for her ex-husband. Your \u2018old man\u2019 was probably bent out of shape by the realisation that you weren\u2019t his daughter, and your Mom had cheated, which would make it hard to keep going with a fatherhood responsibility, and there\u2019s probably an appropriate AITA for him to post on about how he behaved, and how he felt. Or maybe there\u2019s a chance for you to resolve that with him, if you feel curious to do so. Your future self may be grateful for such resolution.\n\nIf you feel confident that\u2019s not how you feel, then offering a suitable response to persuade mean family members to be quiet should come easily. I hope things work out for you.", "NTA, didn\u2019t want a relationship w you back then, don\u2019t come missing it when he could possible leave\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Please keep us updated!", "No one is the AH in this situation. I don't understand why everyone's saying the dad is the AH for abandoning the woman that broke his trust. It must've been hard for him to accept the fact that you were not his real daughter. At the same time however, what both your parents did to you was horrible! I can't imagine a 7 year old finding out her dad isn't her dad. You do not owe your dad or his other family anything. I don't think people should blame your mom either. She probably feels a lot of guilt towards the fact that she cheated and feels a need to make up for that. Maybe she thinks this is a way to make up for what she did wrong. I do think it is wrong for her to feel that you owe him anything.", "NTA but he raised you for 7 years and paid child support for another man's kid. The least you could do his hear him out. Imo you owe it to him.", "[deleted]", "I do think you should sit down your brother's and as calmly as you explain that while their struggles and feelings around **their** dad's health, the man has made it clear for over 15 years he has no interest in you. Explain that the more they push the more you're loosing your patience. Explain that you respect and validate their feelings and in turn they need to do the same to you and **stop trying to get you involved**.\n\nWrite a letter if it helps and maybe bring a friend who can pinch you everytime you get (rightfully) angry. This is solely to preserve your relationship with your brother's. \n\nRemind your mother that she might have some guilt towards the man she cheated on. You however are innocent and government mandated child support and the decision to NOT report a crime does not father material make. \n\nFinally, keep doing what feels good for you. If your siblings try to engage in the conversation say \"I respect your relationship with him, respect the fact that I don't have **any** obligation to a man who abandoned me\". \n\nKeep living your life, be happy and this too shall pass. You'll be just fine dear. \n\nNTA", "Couldn\u2019t have put it better myself. NTA. I can definitely understand why the not-father would have been hurt and angry all those years ago but he was the adult in the situation. He took out his feelings on an innocent child, who loved him as a father. Which is an action that\u2019s within his rights I guess, but the current fall out is well within the expected consequences. As for the \u201cgood points\u201d well child support is his legal obligation and about the car vandalism\u2026 he\u2019d have been the major AH if he had actually pressed charges then lol. OP owes him nothing", "I\u2019m glad Op and mom are reconciled, but I don\u2019t understand why mom isn\u2019t understanding Op\u2019s point of view!", "No one is saying the dad is an asshole for abandoning the woman who broke his trust. They\u2019re saying the dad is an asshole for abandoning the child he raised for 7 years. He could have left the mom and retained a relationship with all 3 of the children.", "I beg to differ. She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. For one if he happened to sign her birth certificate, then he\u2019s obliged by law to pay child support. And for two, she never asked to be brought into this world. I say keep doing what your doing girl, don\u2019t trauma bond yourself to him girl.", "read the last sentence"]}
