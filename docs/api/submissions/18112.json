The man who had been raising me as my father (54m) found out I was not his biological child (my two older brothers are) when I was 7 and promptly abandoned me and divorced my mom. He was very involved up until this point and was actually in the middle of coaching my soccer team when it happened. He abandoned that too and the assistant coach had to take over. Anyways. He ended up (not sure how) paying child support to my mom for me, probably because he was the breadwinner and him leaving my mom left us two in pretty dire financial circumstances. I was also yanked out of the private school my brothers and I attended. He remarried a few years later to a woman with a daughter a year younger than me and promptly did everything with her that he used to do with me. Hurrah for them. Sophomore year of highschool some organization was hosting a father-daughter dance in our school gym while I was around campus with some friends (can\u2019t remember) and we vandalized the fancy car he pulled up in.  Not something I\u2019m proud of but I\u2019m mentioning it here because although I paid for half the cost of repairs he graciously paid the other half and decided not to press charges.\n\nAnyways, now the old man has cancer,  both brothers and stepdaughter are out of state with school, and his wife has early arthritis or something, not really sure. He calls MY mom and asks her if either of us could drive him to and from chemotherapy! We were in the car and he was on speaker, so I told him no, that\u2019s something family does and he\u2019s made it very clear he doesn\u2019t see either of us as family and  hung up. \n\nMom is doing things like bringing casseroles and driving him. I don\u2019t try to stop her but I don\u2019t help her either. She has recently started to try and guilt me into it, saying:\n\n- He always payed child support, to which I said the amount of money he lost on that was about as impactful as a fart in the wind for ole moneybags \n- He didn\u2019t press charges about his car, to which I said great he did one nice thing for me, so he can get ONE casserole or ONE car ride. \n\nNow my siblings and his stepdaughter have all flown in and my brother says he (not dad) REALLY needs to speak to me. I said to tell him that if he has something to say to me I don\u2019t want to hear it and if he writes me a letter I\u2019m not opening it. I said I was sorry for what they were going through but that he\u2019s made it very clear I\u2019m not his family and so I don\u2019t want them asking me for things they would ask of family. However they\u2019re struggling and the more they ask for help the more my patience wears thin and the more insensitive my rejections get. My mother recently talked with me about \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d- AITA? Also please don\u2019t leave comments like \u201cThe real asshole is your mom for cheating and committing paternity fraud!\u201d Like, thanks for that one Sherlock, and my mother and I have reconciled.\n\nEDIT: My mom is pushing me to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d because our pastor says it will have a healing effect on my soul (she is very religious).\n\nEDIT 2: The situation is more complicated than not dad being an innocent angel victim and mom deciding to do paternity fraud for funsies.

The man who had raised you as his own daughter, for seven years, suddenly dumped you. It was not your fault that your mother had cheated. You loved him as your father. He ripped away your security, your family, your lifestyle, and I am sure a good chunk of your heart.  That is not something that is easily forgiven. Maybe your mother is helping him because she still has some sort of sense of guilt. But that is not your guilt to carry. That man did you very wrong, and I wouldn't shed a tear when he died if I were you. \n\nI am sorry your brothers are suffering. It's understandable, they are worried about their father.  But he has not been a father to you for 15 years. By his own choice. How much is one child supposed to take? Not only did he withdraw his love and affection, but then he made you watch as he showered that attention on another little girl who was also not his child.  He seems to have no problem loving her.\n\nThe hurt and trauma he has caused you is not easily gotten over. It sucks that your mom is so quick to overlook the damage that was done to you in order to try to rehabilitate herself. It's not about being the bigger person. The injustices he did to you were inflicted on a child. He had the opportunity to do right by you and chose not to.  Your mom is infidelity was not your fault. The relationship you had established with him for seven years meant nothing to him. And now he means nothing to you. And that's OK.", "NTA. He clearly thought biology was more important than the years he had spent raising you that he left you immediately. \n\nI think it\u2019s ok to remind him that biology was crucial to him and so there\u2019s no reason he should need to speak to you now.

There may be fallout with your brothers, especially as they grieve, but no one can reasonably expect a child who was discarded the way you were to put herself in a place of suffering again. If they can\u2019t understand that, then that is a limitation on their parts that you cannot control.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay if you decide you want to speak to him, but that is a decision that should be made solely by you and in the absence of guilt or pressure.\n\nEither way, do whatever sets you up to take the healthiest next steps in life.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t been in therapy yet, please go.

I do not believe you are obligated, and other family members being mean is really not fair. \n\nA therapist would likely say \u2018you have control over your actions, and only you can judge the merit of those actions\u2019 - however much we might all struggle over what we perceive others think about us. Asking Reddit for an opinion, makes me curious about why this situation isn\u2019t more simply resolved for you. Your Mom is acting compassionately, perhaps reflecting her affection for her ex-husband. Your \u2018old man\u2019 was probably bent out of shape by the realisation that you weren\u2019t his daughter, and your Mom had cheated, which would make it hard to keep going with a fatherhood responsibility, and there\u2019s probably an appropriate AITA for him to post on about how he behaved, and how he felt. Or maybe there\u2019s a chance for you to resolve that with him, if you feel curious to do so. Your future self may be grateful for such resolution.\n\nIf you feel confident that\u2019s not how you feel, then offering a suitable response to persuade mean family members to be quiet should come easily.

I don't understand why everyone's saying the dad is the AH for abandoning the woman that broke his trust. It must've been hard for him to accept the fact that you were not his real daughter. At the same time however, what both your parents did to you was horrible! I can't imagine a 7 year old finding out her dad isn't her dad. You do not owe your dad or his other family anything. I don't think people should blame your mom either. She probably feels a lot of guilt towards the fact that she cheated and feels a need to make up for that. Maybe she thinks this is a way to make up for what she did wrong.

Explain that you respect and validate their feelings and in turn they need to do the same to you and **stop trying to get you involved**.\n\nWrite a letter if it helps and maybe bring a friend who can pinch you everytime you get (rightfully) angry. This is solely to preserve your relationship with your brother's. \n\nRemind your mother that she might have some guilt towards the man she cheated on. You however are innocent and government mandated child support and the decision to NOT report a crime does not father material make. \n\nFinally, keep doing what feels good for you.

I can definitely understand why the not-father would have been hurt and angry all those years ago but he was the adult in the situation.

I know you don't want to hear it, but she is continuing her AH behavior and weaponizing it against you via manipulation. Her actions caused this rift. Not your 'not dad.' You are not responsible for helping him, but your mom is helping to alleviate her guilt. Her actions ripped the family apart. Someone else got her pregnant, and it was not your 'not dad'. She wants your relationship to improve with him so she feels better about ripping him out of your life. All this 'be the bigger person' is a way to fake a normal family and make her feel better. She hurt her ex-husband, you, and your brothers. She has to live with that.  You have no guilt as you did nothing wrong. That's why you say no so adamantly. \n\nI dont blame your 'not dad' for leaving. It is absolutely horrible to you, but you became a living embodiment of what your mom did. If he did an AITA for leaving, most would vote N T A, and some would criticize leaving you behind. \n\nThis whole situation is above reddits pay grade, but I am willing to bet their is a lot more to the story than you know.

He raised you like his daughter for 7 years and then abandoned you due to something you had no control over. That is really messed up to do to a 7 year old.

Reddit loves to preach empathy and how letting go is the best thing until it doesnt fit their narrative. You went through something so traumatic, you were just a little girl who didnt deserve to be tossed but him walking away is better than him staying and abusing you, neglecting you, and creating even bigger problems. Im sure he still in some ways cares for you; he paid child support when he could\u2019ve fought to prove you werent his, after all you mentioned he paid for private school so he might have enough money to fight in court.

Instead, he decided that his hurt was magnitudes more important than the wellbeing of a child he raised and claimed to love and disappeared. \n\nSure, he had the right to do that, and his feelings were valid--but it was still selfish, and he still punished an innocent child who knew him as her father. And now he continues to make selfish choices.", "From what I can tell she forgave the mother but still bore a lot of resentment towards how the family split, so she put all that resentment on the (not) dad. It seems like she resents him for not being able to forgive her mothers betrayal, the same way she can't forgive him for betraying the family she held dear. It makes neither of them the AH.\n\nThere are no take-backs from cheating, bearing another person's child and then lying about it for 7 years either. That wrecks a relationship to the point it's better to give up. \n\nBut I come back to the same question; how did he hurt her more than if he involved himself in her life?

I try to understand what he could've done better for both his ex and her daughter. \n\n\nOpt.1\n\n>he shouldn't have left\n\nOkay.

Would that be any semblance of a healthy relationship?\n\n\nOpt.2 \n\n>he should've kept a relationship with the daughter \n\nTo me it seems like the other siblings (her two brothers) took the dad's side. Why wouldn't the daughter as well in this scenario? That means he came between mom and daughter and would be brutal towards the mom and would be a dick move since he didn't really have standing to keep her as his daughter unless he stayed with the mother.\n\nI can't see how he demands forgiveness? And even if he didn't she wouldn't be TA if he asked/beg/pleaded either. I just can't see the hate towards the dad. Only the mother seems like an asshole, everyone else is just trying to live with it and the daughter pushed all the resentment of her shitty upbringing on the guy who had the impossible task. But that doesn't make her an AH. \n\nI also think her logic is pretty flawed. \"Money bags\" did one nice thing for her every month for 11 years considering he paid child support in addition to paying for half the car and not press charges (even though he would've been a major asshole if he did).", "Fair enough!

You saying things like \u201c it doesn\u2019t absolve him from betraying the Op\u201d is self imposed rule you put on yourself. That\u2019s not how reality works. You can\u2019t hurt someone with the mindset of \u201c if I hurt them they should only hurt me\u201d in truth your actions will never dictate the next man reactions. If you hurt someone, they could retaliate on you, your spouse , your kid, your parents. Whoever it is just to hurt you even more. It doesn\u2019t make them wrong or right.  You also listed a couple is scenarios that the op dad could of taken but you forgot the option of building up resentment towards the child and mother and maybe killing them both in the end? It\u2019s so many stories out there of women being killed for lying about paternity. That\u2019s a very real option. So I feel he did the best option was to remove himself from that situation entirely before things went from bad to worst", "\"Has to?\" No. He did not \"have to\" do anything. But he DID choose to cut off an innocent girl from the man she'd loved as a father. Some men who find out the child they raised since a baby is not genetically theirs manage to keep from punishing the innocent child equally with the guilty mother. He chose not to.\n\nEven stripping out the emotional element and looking at it from the strictly monetary view you're so wedded to, she owes him nothing. He paid the absolute minimum child support he could get away with for a child he was legally responsible for while making her watch him lavishing an education on her brothers and stepsister he refused her. He paid a legal obligation to a child's support while treating her as a stranger. He has no legal right to demand that money back in goods or services. He agreed to not press charges and forgive half the debt of his car vandalism if she paid the other. She paid. Again, no debt owed.  Since he HAS money in abundance, the only monetary reason for him to demand free service from OP is stinginess, and OP has the same right as any stranger in the street to indignantly refuse a rich man the free ride he demands.\n\nI'd guess that with his mortality staring him in the face, it's weighing on his conscience that he wronged OP, and he's groping for some way to talk to her. But an entitled demand to get a free service out of her WHILE he does this is NOT the way to go. I'd agree with the poster who advises she request he pay for her therapy as a reasonable way for her to recover from the trauma of the relationship he broke and decide if she can reestablish it, before he starts asking her for favors.", "I agree with you up  until the last line.  He's not entitled to ask for something from her because he paid child support.  OP is innocent this mess. They have no relationship. I don't know why he chose to pay child support rather than fight it, but that doesn't entitle him to ask OP for her time.  He can demand things of his ex-wife till the cows come home, but he should leave OP alone.", "I don't think that's how most people see the world though.\n\nYou don't have an obligation to protect all children around the world, or even all children that you know. You *do* have an obligation to protect your biological children, and children you voluntarily accept responsibility for.\n\nIn cases like this, the mother failed her duty to protect her biological child right at the start. The father who was tricked into accepting responsibility for that child isn't in the wrong for withdrawing his consent when he has the truth. It is quite literally her fault. Without the initial lie, they wouldn't be in this position to begin with.\n\n> And he did voluntarily enter this situation, \n\nHe literally didn't though. You can't agree to a situation based on false pretenses and then claim that it's voluntary. \n\nHe was told a child was his. Therefore he has an automatic responsibility for it.\n\nHe later finds out it wasn't his, and he never voluntarily chose to take care of a child that wasn't his, so he is not obligated to do so.\n\nAs an example:\n\nI tell you that I've signed a house over to you and you own it from now on, but it needs some roofing work done. You do the roofing work because you own the house, it's your responsibility. You carry on paying all house liabilities. \n\nBut 7 years later I say \"sorry dude, I actually never transferred ownership of the house to you. I lied to you about that\".\n\nI then ask you to pay for the plumbing to be fixed too.\n\nAre you just going to say \"welp, I accepted the responsibility voluntarily so I guess I'll just have to pay for it\" or are you going to claim that because that responsibility was based on a lie, you do not need to continue it?", "It\u2019s simple.

It would have to be an extreme case of being naive to trick a woman that way, however it\u2019s so easy for a woman to get pregnant from another man and have her husband believe the child is his. But that\u2019s why I believe my comparison stands. The betrayal is there. And a woman still wouldn\u2019t want to take care of a child that their husband had in an affair. Had she would have told him, he could of left even before he had built a bond with this girl. But he was robbed of his choice because she kept it hidden after 7 years.

According to you,  it\u2019s expected for a man to take care of a child that\u2019s not his and was tricked into believing it was it which is objectively worse than just having a baby with a side chick and springing it on your wife. On another note. On my last post you brought up morals. So even though the mother was morally wrong, even though she kept up the lie for 7 years, The dad was supposed to just suck it up and be a father to the daughter cause that\u2019s what adults do? So the mom has no accountability and even though the guy paid child support you say he is morally wrong for not wanting to be in the girl\u2019s life after that kind of deceit and betrayal?The level of entitlement is crazy in the comment section.

Then on top of that pay for the mistake your wife made in the form of child support. So not only is there no accountability for mom but she got paid for being unfaithful.  I got empathy for that man.

Nothing OP had posted suggests he did anything toward OP with bad intent towards OP. To me it looks like he did what he could to pick up the pieces after his life was shattered by his wife's infidelity and lies. He went above and beyond by stepping up by paying OPs mom to support OP without having to be reminded of the trauma done *to him* by raising a kid who wasn't his. He filled the shoes that should have been worn by the mystery daddy who apparently fled to Mexico. It's another failure of OPs mom that she didn't try hard enough to find him.

No. Only now, when he's on the death bed.\n\n>reached out to ask for a ride.\n\nNah. You recognize he's wealthy and can afford pricey lawyers.

But one can only wonder what is it he feels like to talk about. Finally felt the need to clear his consciousness? He fears he might not have it out for long, and needs to tie up the loose ends? A tad bit late for that.\n\nHe's not entitled to OP's time, or attention, or emotional stability. He already hurt her once, no need to let him do that twice. If he wants to clear his mind, he may want to send another message through his sons, or send a letter, but OP already clarified she won't be reading the latters.

I really wish for you that you could have some people in your corner, especially adults, who are really there for \\*you\\*.

You don't have to have any kind of relationship afterwards.  It just gives you the chance to let go of the anger and move on.\n\nI say this from experience as I hated my stepmom for years and held in anger and spite. She made the environment toxic so I felt I needed to leave and moved across the country.  Years later, she came to me one day and ask me why I don't talk to her and apologize for how things turn out.  She apologize for how she acted all those years ago.

It was never about you, it was about him and his inability to deal with the situation. \n\nAdults have meltdowns too. As harsh as it is to say it, he was not responsible for you because you were not his child. \n\nThat does not mean your feelings are not justified.  Your feeling abandoned happened because you actually were abandoned.

Don't know that I would filly accept an apology, but it would feel good to know this hurt him too.\n\nBut I would go so I could get closure, not because he wants it. \n\nThis will always hurt you, you can't run from the past.
