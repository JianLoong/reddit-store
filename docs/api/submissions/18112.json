The man who had been raising me as my father (54m) found out I was not his biological child (my two older brothers are) when I was 7 and promptly abandoned me and divorced my mom. He was very involved up until this point and was actually in the middle of coaching my soccer team when it happened. He abandoned that too and the assistant coach had to take over. Anyways. He ended up (not sure how) paying child support to my mom for me, probably because he was the breadwinner and him leaving my mom left us two in pretty dire financial circumstances. I was also yanked out of the private school my brothers and I attended. He remarried a few years later to a woman with a daughter a year younger than me and promptly did everything with her that he used to do with me. Hurrah for them. Sophomore year of highschool some organization was hosting a father-daughter dance in our school gym while I was around campus with some friends (can\u2019t remember) and we vandalized the fancy car he pulled up in.  Not something I\u2019m proud of but I\u2019m mentioning it here because although I paid for half the cost of repairs he graciously paid the other half and decided not to press charges.\n\nAnyways, now the old man has cancer,  both brothers and stepdaughter are out of state with school, and his wife has early arthritis or something, not really sure. He calls MY mom and asks her if either of us could drive him to and from chemotherapy! We were in the car and he was on speaker, so I told him no, that\u2019s something family does and he\u2019s made it very clear he doesn\u2019t see either of us as family and  hung up. \n\nMom is doing things like bringing casseroles and driving him. I don\u2019t try to stop her but I don\u2019t help her either. She has recently started to try and guilt me into it, saying:\n\n- He always payed child support, to which I said the amount of money he lost on that was about as impactful as a fart in the wind for ole moneybags \n- He didn\u2019t press charges about his car, to which I said great he did one nice thing for me, so he can get ONE casserole or ONE car ride. \n\nNow my siblings and his stepdaughter have all flown in and my brother says he (not dad) REALLY needs to speak to me. I said to tell him that if he has something to say to me I don\u2019t want to hear it and if he writes me a letter I\u2019m not opening it. I said I was sorry for what they were going through but that he\u2019s made it very clear I\u2019m not his family and so I don\u2019t want them asking me for things they would ask of family. However they\u2019re struggling and the more they ask for help the more my patience wears thin and the more insensitive my rejections get.

The man who had raised you as his own daughter, for seven years, suddenly dumped you. It was not your fault that your mother had cheated. You loved him as your father. He ripped away your security, your family, your lifestyle, and I am sure a good chunk of your heart.  That is not something that is easily forgiven. Maybe your mother is helping him because she still has some sort of sense of guilt. But that is not your guilt to carry. That man did you very wrong, and I wouldn't shed a tear when he died if I were you. \n\nI am sorry your brothers are suffering. It's understandable, they are worried about their father.  But he has not been a father to you for 15 years. By his own choice. How much is one child supposed to take? Not only did he withdraw his love and affection, but then he made you watch as he showered that attention on another little girl who was also not his child.  He seems to have no problem loving her.\n\nThe hurt and trauma he has caused you is not easily gotten over. It sucks that your mom is so quick to overlook the damage that was done to you in order to try to rehabilitate herself. It's not about being the bigger person. The injustices he did to you were inflicted on a child. He had the opportunity to do right by you and chose not to.  Your mom is infidelity was not your fault. The relationship you had established with him for seven years meant nothing to him. And now he means nothing to you. And that's OK.", "NTA. He clearly thought biology was more important than the years he had spent raising you that he left you immediately. \n\nI think it\u2019s ok to remind him that biology was crucial to him and so there\u2019s no reason he should need to speak to you now. Especially if it\u2019s going to cause you angst. Here he is, with cancer, and still finding ways to bring you pain. No sir\u2026.no thanks. Take a WHOLE seat sir.", "NTA. Your mom being nice to him makes a kind of sense. She cheated on him so she feels guilty for the fallout and divorce\n\nHowever you were blameless and he treated 7 year old you cruelly and your feelings are valid too.

That must have hurt like hell \n\nYou owe him nothing", "NTA. He decided it was a good idea to punish a 7-year-old child for something she didn't understand or have anything to do with.

There may be fallout with your brothers, especially as they grieve, but no one can reasonably expect a child who was discarded the way you were to put herself in a place of suffering again. If they can\u2019t understand that, then that is a limitation on their parts that you cannot control.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay if you decide you want to speak to him, but that is a decision that should be made solely by you and in the absence of guilt or pressure.\n\nEither way, do whatever sets you up to take the healthiest next steps in life.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t been in therapy yet, please go.

But, if he has something to say, and he has limited time to say \u2018it\u2019, your opportunity to be curious is limited. \n\nIf you feel conflicted, naturally due to the hurt you feel, then I would suggest that there will be an inevitable regret later in life that you never stepped in to offer support. I do not believe you are obligated, and other family members being mean is really not fair. \n\nA therapist would likely say \u2018you have control over your actions, and only you can judge the merit of those actions\u2019 - however much we might all struggle over what we perceive others think about us. Asking Reddit for an opinion, makes me curious about why this situation isn\u2019t more simply resolved for you. Your Mom is acting compassionately, perhaps reflecting her affection for her ex-husband. Your \u2018old man\u2019 was probably bent out of shape by the realisation that you weren\u2019t his daughter, and your Mom had cheated, which would make it hard to keep going with a fatherhood responsibility, and there\u2019s probably an appropriate AITA for him to post on about how he behaved, and how he felt. Or maybe there\u2019s a chance for you to resolve that with him, if you feel curious to do so. Your future self may be grateful for such resolution.\n\nIf you feel confident that\u2019s not how you feel, then offering a suitable response to persuade mean family members to be quiet should come easily.

I don't understand why everyone's saying the dad is the AH for abandoning the woman that broke his trust. It must've been hard for him to accept the fact that you were not his real daughter. At the same time however, what both your parents did to you was horrible! I can't imagine a 7 year old finding out her dad isn't her dad. You do not owe your dad or his other family anything. I don't think people should blame your mom either. She probably feels a lot of guilt towards the fact that she cheated and feels a need to make up for that. Maybe she thinks this is a way to make up for what she did wrong. I do think it is wrong for her to feel that you owe him anything.", "NTA but he raised you for 7 years and paid child support for another man's kid. The least you could do his hear him out. Imo you owe it to him.", "[deleted]", "I do think you should sit down your brother's and as calmly as you explain that while their struggles and feelings around **their** dad's health, the man has made it clear for over 15 years he has no interest in you. Explain that the more they push the more you're loosing your patience. Explain that you respect and validate their feelings and in turn they need to do the same to you and **stop trying to get you involved**.\n\nWrite a letter if it helps and maybe bring a friend who can pinch you everytime you get (rightfully) angry. This is solely to preserve your relationship with your brother's. \n\nRemind your mother that she might have some guilt towards the man she cheated on. You however are innocent and government mandated child support and the decision to NOT report a crime does not father material make. \n\nFinally, keep doing what feels good for you. If your siblings try to engage in the conversation say \"I respect your relationship with him, respect the fact that I don't have **any** obligation to a man who abandoned me\". \n\nKeep living your life, be happy and this too shall pass.

I can definitely understand why the not-father would have been hurt and angry all those years ago but he was the adult in the situation. He took out his feelings on an innocent child, who loved him as a father. Which is an action that\u2019s within his rights I guess, but the current fall out is well within the expected consequences. As for the \u201cgood points\u201d well child support is his legal obligation and about the car vandalism\u2026 he\u2019d have been the major AH if he had actually pressed charges then lol.

She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. For one if he happened to sign her birth certificate, then he\u2019s obliged by law to pay child support.

He made it clear he isn\u2019t your father and you are 100% right to go along with that now. \n\nIf he wasn\u2019t sick he would never have tried to make you family. This is entirely about his needs and your brother\u2019s needs.\n\nAlso if he really is \u201col mobeybags\u201d then he can pay for a private nurse to help him. Not attempt to sponge off the one person in the world who is least obliged to help him.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is. I know you don't want to hear it, but she is continuing her AH behavior and weaponizing it against you via manipulation. Her actions caused this rift. Not your 'not dad.' You are not responsible for helping him, but your mom is helping to alleviate her guilt. Her actions ripped the family apart. Someone else got her pregnant, and it was not your 'not dad'. She wants your relationship to improve with him so she feels better about ripping him out of your life. All this 'be the bigger person' is a way to fake a normal family and make her feel better. She hurt her ex-husband, you, and your brothers. She has to live with that.  You have no guilt as you did nothing wrong. That's why you say no so adamantly. \n\nI dont blame your 'not dad' for leaving. It is absolutely horrible to you, but you became a living embodiment of what your mom did. If he did an AITA for leaving, most would vote N T A, and some would criticize leaving you behind. \n\nThis whole situation is above reddits pay grade, but I am willing to bet their is a lot more to the story than you know. I would bet your mom simply has not told you as it makes her look worse. Their is a reason he paid child support (depending on state you can be removed if proven not the parent via dna, or at least could be fought), their is a reason your siblings are on his side, and it sounds like your dad got custody of your brothers and not your mom - their is a reason for this as well. \n\nNTA for wanting nothing to do with him.

If he's rich, what does he need you for? He can hire a car service and a home health aide. Any of the other kids can move back.\n\nI would be curious about what he had to say though. Has the cancer made him regret how he treated you? Is he trying to make amends or just guilt you into free labor? Would you be willing to help if he paid you?\n\nDid you find your biodad?", "NTA. He raised you like his daughter for 7 years and then abandoned you due to something you had no control over. That is really messed up to do to a 7 year old. The part that pushes this past NAH into he's definitely the AH is that he has the audacity to ask you for help without groveling at your feet.\n\nThe only reason I could think of to see him again would be if there was any last things you wanted to say to him before he died.

After all these memories, how can a lack of a biological link change that? I would be beside myself with worry if she was gone.

However I\u2019m going to say he\u2019s potentially not the AH either, finding that out for him would have hit like a tonne of bricks and he reacted badly, given his age handling emotions was never something he was taught and he definitely should have gotten therapy, and it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t be so bad off getting some too. \n\nMortality has a way of bringing perspective to some of these things and it\u2019s likely he hasn\u2019t ever found a way to try and reach out and now that he has this hanging over his head he wants to at least attempt to apologise or make things right. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but speaking as someone who has been a very angry kid in my early 20\u2019s you may regret not having the conversation, especially if he loses this fight.", "NTA.\n\nBut I'm not sure he is either. Finding out that you weren't his child would have been massively hurtful on his part. While I'm sure 7yo you felt betrayed, so did he, and rightly so. His actions to go and raise a stepdaughter your age is also a major kick in the teeth for you. \n\nI can understand him reaching out in need to your mom, and her guilt in helping him. That doesn't mean you have to be the one to help him. You have a boundary here, and your family is trying to tear it down. They are TA here, I judge.\n\nWith all that said, I'd work out if there's anything you want to say to him, or ask him.

Is it because his name is on the birth certificate?

It sounds like he (the not your father) may have come to the realization that he behaved badly in regards to you due to a serious illness and maybe would like to resolve the situation so he has no regrets, you do not have to give it to him.\n\nI however suggest therapy to help yourself.  Find out what you need to be in a better place mentally.  You are not the one that caused this situation but you were one of the ones heavily effected by it.

His relationship with her was built on a false premise instead of a genuine one although he was sincere with raising her. The ex wife or mother of OP caused this rift. Don\u2019t get me wrong. It was wrong to leave. Biology doesn\u2019t seem at play here though.

No one is strong in everything they do and they can falter. Imo, I\u2019m focused in on how the not father cares about OP. OP made light of the vandalism in which he had no responsibility to even pay half. It was his car. OP doesn\u2019t need to do anything for him. Would just say that the resentment would continue playing itself out even after not father\u2019s death.

Can you imagine if someone posted in AITA: \"my wife of YEARS hid that our 7 year old daughter isn't mine, AITA if I leave?\" 90% of the responses would be N T A, get out of there, she's betrayed you and you'll never trust her again, it would be harming the daughter to stay around when you don't love her etc..\n\nBut once the bridge is burnt, like you said, you can't expect help from those same people years later. NTA", "Def n.t.a. I hate that term be the bigger person. It's always the wronged one that has to be the bigger person.    As an adult to a child he had the chance to be the bigger person.

It\u2019s more about putting OP in a position where she has to be in a room with him while he insists she forgive him.

Dude found out his wife betrayed him and decided on the spot the daughter he'd raised wasn't his problem anymore. That is just heartbreaking.", "Mom had sole custody of me (duh) and Dad had primary custody for brothers. \nTo be honest I really think that A) Not-dad spent time trashing Mom to brothers, which yes I understand she is responsible, brothers have never let go of resentment of her (which is their right) and B) He has and always had money. He had better lawyers.  C) Mom went from being very involved to very tired from working all the time. Sometimes she would fall asleep early on the couch. Not-dad doesn\u2019t do this he has a normal 9-5, he doesn\u2019t work crazy hours. Stepmom doesn\u2019t do this because she is a SAHM. I don\u2019t blame her for this but I think they do. So I can see why they resent her a lot and I don\u2019t get upset with them for it or try to force them to reconcile i just wish the same courtesy could be extended to me.", "Nah it\u2019ll just be a pissweak apology and a guilt trip to forgive him.", "Oh he will not admit to being rich he\u2019s just \u201cvery comfortable\u201d lol. He hasn\u2019t said anything to me because I haven\u2019t heard him out yet.

I have a name and some basic info about bio dad\u2026Mom isn\u2019t 100% sure if he was even a US citizen. He was working doing construction on a new addition to our house. I know. It\u2019s wild. That\u2019s what actually caused not-dad to first give me the side eye\u2026the summer before he left we went to vacation at the Bahamas for the first time and my Mexican genes activated or something. I got really dark to the point people just assumed I was adopted. We can\u2019t track him down so I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s happy in Mexico with zero clue I exist.", "might be my favorite response so far", "Finally someone that sees this Op is valid in her feelings but the not father is valid as well he was lied for seven years thinking she was his daughter he mentally lost it being betrayed by Op's mother then going on having to pay child support for Op. Both Op and not father was the victims of the mother she created this mess by having a affair. As for the stepdaughter he knew from the very beginning she wasn't his child no lying that she was. Op is human as well as the not father. I've read numerous post where the parents stay in the child life but resenting the child only to do so much mental damage to the child. If the not father stayed he very well could have done so much more mental damage  just staying. YES Op does not owe him anything at all but I truly think she doesn't really understand or see how hurt he was for being lied to believing they was bio father and daughter. I can not stand how all these comments are so against this man he chose a path to exit so he would be the monster that abandoned a seven year old. He was hurt by his wife which should have gotten Op help in the very beginning for her mistake her lies that led to this and now she wants Op to \" be the bigger person \" so she can feel better for herself", "The only disagreement is the mother is the asshole here she not only lied to her ex husband but knowingly lied to Op when she was a little girl that he was her dad.", "I would assume birth certificate and no he didn\u2019t want visitation basically ignored me when he came to pick up brothers", "if only you were there to say those words to seven year old me", "I will add that after the whole fallout, my mom really leaned on her church community (not dad didn\u2019t attend). She talks to our pastor a lot because we can\u2019t really afford therapy and obviously being Christian and all he\u2019s really big on forgiveness. It\u2019s not that my mom thinks that I\u2019m obligated to forgive him, but I think she genuinely believes it will have some kind of healing effect on me because that\u2019s what the church teaches. I think I will add an edit to clarify that.", "NTA. He abandoned you at age 7. I\u2019m sorry. That must have hurt like hell\n\nYou owe him nothing", "I understand the pain he must have felt. I really do. But abandoning a child at age 7 who only ever knew you as dad is beyond bridge burning - it\u2019s nuking it.

Agreed\n\nI guarantee you this sub would be baying for blood and telling him to gtfo and cut ties immediately if the discovered cheating scenario was posted in AITA.

He was betrayed and I absolutely guarantee you that people would be saying \"you'll do her more harm by staying and resenting her\" if this question was posted in AITA. I've literally read that over and over on similar types of cheating discovered posts.\n\nThe new step kids for which he's caring are connected to him through a loving relationship with the new step mum, he has chosen to take on a role there. Once the cheating was discovered in the former relationship, he was neither  the biological father and nor was there a love connection - therefore, no relationship and him cutting ties would be totally justified to many people on here.\n\nBut, you can't have your cake and eat it.

So I forgave her with full knowledge that she didn\u2019t deserve it just like Christ forgave me when I didn\u2019t deserve it.

I mentioned in reply that one thing that may help you is therapy.  I have now seen ithat is out of reach for you at this point.  \n\nTruly I think if they keep pressing or pushing for a conversation between you and him (not the father), you may consider informing them that the damage he has caused you is something that is preventing you from having this conversation.  If he\u2019d really truly would like to talk to you he would do so after you\u2019ve had time to heal, that his abandonment is still an open wound (I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it but it is OP) but unfortunately you lack the tools to start healing such as therapy.  If he\u2019d like to pay for the therapy that you would accept that, but you will not have any conversations (even with the not the father paying for it) until you feel ready.
