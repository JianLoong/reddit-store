The man who had been raising me as my father (54m) found out I was not his biological child (my two older brothers are) when I was 7 and promptly abandoned me and divorced my mom. He was very involved up until this point and was actually in the middle of coaching my soccer team when it happened. He abandoned that too and the assistant coach had to take over. Anyways. He ended up (not sure how) paying child support to my mom for me, probably because he was the breadwinner and him leaving my mom left us two in pretty dire financial circumstances. I was also yanked out of the private school my brothers and I attended. He remarried a few years later to a woman with a daughter a year younger than me and promptly did everything with her that he used to do with me. Hurrah for them. Sophomore year of highschool some organization was hosting a father-daughter dance in our school gym while I was around campus with some friends (can\u2019t remember) and we vandalized the fancy car he pulled up in.  Not something I\u2019m proud of but I\u2019m mentioning it here because although I paid for half the cost of repairs he graciously paid the other half and decided not to press charges.\n\nAnyways, now the old man has cancer,  both brothers and stepdaughter are out of state with school, and his wife has early arthritis or something, not really sure. He calls MY mom and asks her if either of us could drive him to and from chemotherapy! We were in the car and he was on speaker, so I told him no, that\u2019s something family does and he\u2019s made it very clear he doesn\u2019t see either of us as family and  hung up. \n\nMom is doing things like bringing casseroles and driving him. I don\u2019t try to stop her but I don\u2019t help her either. She has recently started to try and guilt me into it, saying:\n\n- He always payed child support, to which I said the amount of money he lost on that was about as impactful as a fart in the wind for ole moneybags \n- He didn\u2019t press charges about his car, to which I said great he did one nice thing for me, so he can get ONE casserole or ONE car ride. \n\nNow my siblings and his stepdaughter have all flown in and my brother says he (not dad) REALLY needs to speak to me. I said to tell him that if he has something to say to me I don\u2019t want to hear it and if he writes me a letter I\u2019m not opening it. I said I was sorry for what they were going through but that he\u2019s made it very clear I\u2019m not his family and so I don\u2019t want them asking me for things they would ask of family. However they\u2019re struggling and the more they ask for help the more my patience wears thin and the more insensitive my rejections get.

The man who had raised you as his own daughter, for seven years, suddenly dumped you. It was not your fault that your mother had cheated. You loved him as your father. He ripped away your security, your family, your lifestyle, and I am sure a good chunk of your heart.  That is not something that is easily forgiven. Maybe your mother is helping him because she still has some sort of sense of guilt. But that is not your guilt to carry. That man did you very wrong, and I wouldn't shed a tear when he died if I were you. \n\nI am sorry your brothers are suffering. It's understandable, they are worried about their father.  But he has not been a father to you for 15 years. By his own choice. How much is one child supposed to take? Not only did he withdraw his love and affection, but then he made you watch as he showered that attention on another little girl who was also not his child.  He seems to have no problem loving her.\n\nThe hurt and trauma he has caused you is not easily gotten over. It sucks that your mom is so quick to overlook the damage that was done to you in order to try to rehabilitate herself. It's not about being the bigger person. The injustices he did to you were inflicted on a child. He had the opportunity to do right by you and chose not to.  Your mom is infidelity was not your fault. The relationship you had established with him for seven years meant nothing to him. And now he means nothing to you. And that's OK.", "NTA. He clearly thought biology was more important than the years he had spent raising you that he left you immediately. \n\nI think it\u2019s ok to remind him that biology was crucial to him and so there\u2019s no reason he should need to speak to you now. Especially if it\u2019s going to cause you angst. Here he is, with cancer, and still finding ways to bring you pain. No sir\u2026.no thanks. Take a WHOLE seat sir.", "NTA. Your mom being nice to him makes a kind of sense. She cheated on him so she feels guilty for the fallout and divorce\n\nHowever you were blameless and he treated 7 year old you cruelly and your feelings are valid too.

That must have hurt like hell \n\nYou owe him nothing", "NTA. He decided it was a good idea to punish a 7-year-old child for something she didn't understand or have anything to do with.

There may be fallout with your brothers, especially as they grieve, but no one can reasonably expect a child who was discarded the way you were to put herself in a place of suffering again. If they can\u2019t understand that, then that is a limitation on their parts that you cannot control.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay if you decide you want to speak to him, but that is a decision that should be made solely by you and in the absence of guilt or pressure.\n\nEither way, do whatever sets you up to take the healthiest next steps in life.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t been in therapy yet, please go.

But, if he has something to say, and he has limited time to say \u2018it\u2019, your opportunity to be curious is limited. \n\nIf you feel conflicted, naturally due to the hurt you feel, then I would suggest that there will be an inevitable regret later in life that you never stepped in to offer support. I do not believe you are obligated, and other family members being mean is really not fair. \n\nA therapist would likely say \u2018you have control over your actions, and only you can judge the merit of those actions\u2019 - however much we might all struggle over what we perceive others think about us. Asking Reddit for an opinion, makes me curious about why this situation isn\u2019t more simply resolved for you. Your Mom is acting compassionately, perhaps reflecting her affection for her ex-husband. Your \u2018old man\u2019 was probably bent out of shape by the realisation that you weren\u2019t his daughter, and your Mom had cheated, which would make it hard to keep going with a fatherhood responsibility, and there\u2019s probably an appropriate AITA for him to post on about how he behaved, and how he felt. Or maybe there\u2019s a chance for you to resolve that with him, if you feel curious to do so. Your future self may be grateful for such resolution.\n\nIf you feel confident that\u2019s not how you feel, then offering a suitable response to persuade mean family members to be quiet should come easily.

I don't understand why everyone's saying the dad is the AH for abandoning the woman that broke his trust. It must've been hard for him to accept the fact that you were not his real daughter. At the same time however, what both your parents did to you was horrible! I can't imagine a 7 year old finding out her dad isn't her dad. You do not owe your dad or his other family anything. I don't think people should blame your mom either. She probably feels a lot of guilt towards the fact that she cheated and feels a need to make up for that. Maybe she thinks this is a way to make up for what she did wrong. I do think it is wrong for her to feel that you owe him anything.", "NTA but he raised you for 7 years and paid child support for another man's kid. The least you could do his hear him out. Imo you owe it to him.", "[deleted]", "I do think you should sit down your brother's and as calmly as you explain that while their struggles and feelings around **their** dad's health, the man has made it clear for over 15 years he has no interest in you. Explain that the more they push the more you're loosing your patience. Explain that you respect and validate their feelings and in turn they need to do the same to you and **stop trying to get you involved**.\n\nWrite a letter if it helps and maybe bring a friend who can pinch you everytime you get (rightfully) angry. This is solely to preserve your relationship with your brother's. \n\nRemind your mother that she might have some guilt towards the man she cheated on. You however are innocent and government mandated child support and the decision to NOT report a crime does not father material make. \n\nFinally, keep doing what feels good for you. If your siblings try to engage in the conversation say \"I respect your relationship with him, respect the fact that I don't have **any** obligation to a man who abandoned me\". \n\nKeep living your life, be happy and this too shall pass.

I can definitely understand why the not-father would have been hurt and angry all those years ago but he was the adult in the situation. He took out his feelings on an innocent child, who loved him as a father. Which is an action that\u2019s within his rights I guess, but the current fall out is well within the expected consequences. As for the \u201cgood points\u201d well child support is his legal obligation and about the car vandalism\u2026 he\u2019d have been the major AH if he had actually pressed charges then lol.

She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. For one if he happened to sign her birth certificate, then he\u2019s obliged by law to pay child support.

He made it clear he isn\u2019t your father and you are 100% right to go along with that now. \n\nIf he wasn\u2019t sick he would never have tried to make you family. This is entirely about his needs and your brother\u2019s needs.\n\nAlso if he really is \u201col mobeybags\u201d then he can pay for a private nurse to help him. Not attempt to sponge off the one person in the world who is least obliged to help him.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is. I know you don't want to hear it, but she is continuing her AH behavior and weaponizing it against you via manipulation. Her actions caused this rift. Not your 'not dad.' You are not responsible for helping him, but your mom is helping to alleviate her guilt. Her actions ripped the family apart. Someone else got her pregnant, and it was not your 'not dad'. She wants your relationship to improve with him so she feels better about ripping him out of your life. All this 'be the bigger person' is a way to fake a normal family and make her feel better. She hurt her ex-husband, you, and your brothers. She has to live with that.  You have no guilt as you did nothing wrong. That's why you say no so adamantly. \n\nI dont blame your 'not dad' for leaving. It is absolutely horrible to you, but you became a living embodiment of what your mom did. If he did an AITA for leaving, most would vote N T A, and some would criticize leaving you behind. \n\nThis whole situation is above reddits pay grade, but I am willing to bet their is a lot more to the story than you know. I would bet your mom simply has not told you as it makes her look worse. Their is a reason he paid child support (depending on state you can be removed if proven not the parent via dna, or at least could be fought), their is a reason your siblings are on his side, and it sounds like your dad got custody of your brothers and not your mom - their is a reason for this as well. \n\nNTA for wanting nothing to do with him.

If he's rich, what does he need you for? He can hire a car service and a home health aide. Any of the other kids can move back.\n\nI would be curious about what he had to say though. Has the cancer made him regret how he treated you? Is he trying to make amends or just guilt you into free labor? Would you be willing to help if he paid you?\n\nDid you find your biodad?", "NTA. He raised you like his daughter for 7 years and then abandoned you due to something you had no control over. That is really messed up to do to a 7 year old. The part that pushes this past NAH into he's definitely the AH is that he has the audacity to ask you for help without groveling at your feet.\n\nThe only reason I could think of to see him again would be if there was any last things you wanted to say to him before he died.

After all these memories, how can a lack of a biological link change that? I would be beside myself with worry if she was gone.

However I\u2019m going to say he\u2019s potentially not the AH either, finding that out for him would have hit like a tonne of bricks and he reacted badly, given his age handling emotions was never something he was taught and he definitely should have gotten therapy, and it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t be so bad off getting some too. \n\nMortality has a way of bringing perspective to some of these things and it\u2019s likely he hasn\u2019t ever found a way to try and reach out and now that he has this hanging over his head he wants to at least attempt to apologise or make things right. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but speaking as someone who has been a very angry kid in my early 20\u2019s you may regret not having the conversation, especially if he loses this fight.", "NTA.\n\nBut I'm not sure he is either. Finding out that you weren't his child would have been massively hurtful on his part. While I'm sure 7yo you felt betrayed, so did he, and rightly so. His actions to go and raise a stepdaughter your age is also a major kick in the teeth for you. \n\nI can understand him reaching out in need to your mom, and her guilt in helping him. That doesn't mean you have to be the one to help him. You have a boundary here, and your family is trying to tear it down. They are TA here, I judge.\n\nWith all that said, I'd work out if there's anything you want to say to him, or ask him.

Is it because his name is on the birth certificate?

It sounds like he (the not your father) may have come to the realization that he behaved badly in regards to you due to a serious illness and maybe would like to resolve the situation so he has no regrets, you do not have to give it to him.\n\nI however suggest therapy to help yourself.  Find out what you need to be in a better place mentally.  You are not the one that caused this situation but you were one of the ones heavily effected by it.

His relationship with her was built on a false premise instead of a genuine one although he was sincere with raising her. The ex wife or mother of OP caused this rift. Don\u2019t get me wrong.

He clearly didn't want to be with the mother, didn't want to come between them, but paid the child support. I'm not saying she owes him anything but I don't see what awful thing he did except leave it as best anyone could. What could he have done better?", "Seems like he just up and left the situation without thinking of the repercussions. Monster is pushing it since he still held some type of responsibility (child support) even after all that. I mean who even hears biological fathers pay child support? I bet half don\u2019t even do that.", "And if you found out the kid was not yours, because his mum had an affair with the guy you paid to fix the house for you to live in together. And in these last 7 years you were unsure about the fatherhood. What would you do?

Please don't have kids. Or pets.

Like, a legit question. Because usually humans can't shut off emotions that fast, even if it's 'right'. He wasn't right to abandon a literal child yet he still managed to shut off all that 'love' immediately?\n\nHe watched her birth. Her first steps. Her first word. Her first bedtime story. Kids have learned to read by 7. She read him a story, for the first time.

Could be different by state or income (as OP mentioned) and I'm not drawing conclusions either way yet, but was curious about this? If he paid support for her but had difficulty separating his daughter from the affair, I may judge less harshly. Doesn't excuse not having a relationship for 15 years...so the additional clarity would help.", "In what way did he take anything out on OP? She\u2019s not his kid so he didn\u2019t raise her?

I know you\u2019ve forgiven your Mom for the lying, but she has no right trying to guilt you into helping someone who abandoned you. I can\u2019t imagine the pain you felt when he left and chose to leave you behind. The first guy to ever break your heart was the one that you thought would never hurt you.

I would be contactless. You set boundaries and they don't respect them. They are not entitled to access you. Even mothers need to respect your boundaries.

I mean it was she who ruined everything to begin with right?\n\nNot saying the daughter is TA at all. She's completely innocent. I just don't understand why the hatred and vitriol sent towarss the dad. The dude didn't want to be in the relationship with babymama anymore because she cheated with the contractor. He didn't want to come between mother and a kid that isn't his so he did the least amount of damage; pay for child support and let them be them. \n\nDo you think he should have treated her the same way he treated her siblings? Is that the right answer?", "Please see my other comments so I don\u2019t have to repeat my point.", "I don\u2019t agree. I think redditors would tell him to leave, absolutely.

It takes a cold-hearted person to punish the child like this for her mother\u2019s wrongdoing.", "I think there isn't a right answer to a situation like this. The problem is that he left, then returned on his own time and now both his and her family expects her to be over it and forgive him.\n\nTwo people were hurt by a the mother's decision to cheat. This lead to the dad hurting the daughter. It wasn't right of him, but I can absolutely understand why he acted the way he did. \n\nBut there are no take-backs on a choice like the one he made. And from the comments I think that's why people are reacting so strongly. He is demanding forgiveness as if it's his right for being ill. (Or at least his family and her mother is doing so.)", "I think God would want you to be sincere in your forgiveness, not just forgive because it's expected. I applaud you for choosing to forgive your mom and I really hope after some time (and therapy because let's face it, not getting therapy would be silly) , you'll find it in your heart to forgive him, even if it means keeping your boundaries.  \n\nAnd remember, you are allowed to do that.

Sadly, such things happen far more than we'd like to admit. Perhaps ask for cash for you to pay the therapist with, so he doesn't know who they are.

If it was in the past it the anger (such as the vandalism and the tone of your post) would not be there.  You need to have tools to heal.  Therapy is one of them.  God knows maybe after therapy you may forgive not the father, but you may not.  What it will do is help you be in a better place and that\u2019s the most important part, your mental health.  \n\nCan I ask are you still in school?  High school or even college?  If so check and see if they have mental health services.  You\u2019d be surprised at how many do.  I 20 years ago walked in to my colleges student services and was pleasantly surprised by support.  I had quite a few therapy sessions to help with issues.", "This is a beautiful solution. \n\nForgiveness IS healing, the pastor is not lying, but only if you actually are ready to forgive, and that cannot be done without therapy.
