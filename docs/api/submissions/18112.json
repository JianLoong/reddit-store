He was very involved up until this point and was actually in the middle of coaching my soccer team when it happened. He abandoned that too and the assistant coach had to take over. Anyways. He ended up (not sure how) paying child support to my mom for me, probably because he was the breadwinner and him leaving my mom left us two in pretty dire financial circumstances. I was also yanked out of the private school my brothers and I attended. He remarried a few years later to a woman with a daughter a year younger than me and promptly did everything with her that he used to do with me. Hurrah for them. Sophomore year of highschool some organization was hosting a father-daughter dance in our school gym while I was around campus with some friends (can\u2019t remember) and we vandalized the fancy car he pulled up in.  Not something I\u2019m proud of but I\u2019m mentioning it here because although I paid for half the cost of repairs he graciously paid the other half and decided not to press charges.\n\nAnyways, now the old man has cancer,  both brothers and stepdaughter are out of state with school, and his wife has early arthritis or something, not really sure. He calls MY mom and asks her if either of us could drive him to and from chemotherapy! We were in the car and he was on speaker, so I told him no, that\u2019s something family does and he\u2019s made it very clear he doesn\u2019t see either of us as family and  hung up. \n\nMom is doing things like bringing casseroles and driving him. I don\u2019t try to stop her but I don\u2019t help her either.

I said to tell him that if he has something to say to me I don\u2019t want to hear it and if he writes me a letter I\u2019m not opening it. I said I was sorry for what they were going through but that he\u2019s made it very clear I\u2019m not his family and so I don\u2019t want them asking me for things they would ask of family. However they\u2019re struggling and the more they ask for help the more my patience wears thin and the more insensitive my rejections get.

The man who had raised you as his own daughter, for seven years, suddenly dumped you. It was not your fault that your mother had cheated. You loved him as your father. He ripped away your security, your family, your lifestyle, and I am sure a good chunk of your heart.  That is not something that is easily forgiven. Maybe your mother is helping him because she still has some sort of sense of guilt. But that is not your guilt to carry. That man did you very wrong, and I wouldn't shed a tear when he died if I were you. \n\nI am sorry your brothers are suffering. It's understandable, they are worried about their father.  But he has not been a father to you for 15 years. By his own choice. How much is one child supposed to take? Not only did he withdraw his love and affection, but then he made you watch as he showered that attention on another little girl who was also not his child.  He seems to have no problem loving her.\n\nThe hurt and trauma he has caused you is not easily gotten over. It sucks that your mom is so quick to overlook the damage that was done to you in order to try to rehabilitate herself. It's not about being the bigger person. The injustices he did to you were inflicted on a child. He had the opportunity to do right by you and chose not to.  Your mom is infidelity was not your fault. The relationship you had established with him for seven years meant nothing to him. And now he means nothing to you. And that's OK.", "NTA. He clearly thought biology was more important than the years he had spent raising you that he left you immediately. \n\nI think it\u2019s ok to remind him that biology was crucial to him and so there\u2019s no reason he should need to speak to you now. Especially if it\u2019s going to cause you angst. Here he is, with cancer, and still finding ways to bring you pain. No sir\u2026.no thanks. Take a WHOLE seat sir.", "NTA. Your mom being nice to him makes a kind of sense. She cheated on him so she feels guilty for the fallout and divorce\n\nHowever you were blameless and he treated 7 year old you cruelly and your feelings are valid too.

That must have hurt like hell \n\nYou owe him nothing", "NTA. He decided it was a good idea to punish a 7-year-old child for something she didn't understand or have anything to do with.

There may be fallout with your brothers, especially as they grieve, but no one can reasonably expect a child who was discarded the way you were to put herself in a place of suffering again. If they can\u2019t understand that, then that is a limitation on their parts that you cannot control.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay if you decide you want to speak to him, but that is a decision that should be made solely by you and in the absence of guilt or pressure.\n\nEither way, do whatever sets you up to take the healthiest next steps in life.\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t been in therapy yet, please go.

But, if he has something to say, and he has limited time to say \u2018it\u2019, your opportunity to be curious is limited. \n\nIf you feel conflicted, naturally due to the hurt you feel, then I would suggest that there will be an inevitable regret later in life that you never stepped in to offer support. I do not believe you are obligated, and other family members being mean is really not fair. \n\nA therapist would likely say \u2018you have control over your actions, and only you can judge the merit of those actions\u2019 - however much we might all struggle over what we perceive others think about us. Asking Reddit for an opinion, makes me curious about why this situation isn\u2019t more simply resolved for you. Your Mom is acting compassionately, perhaps reflecting her affection for her ex-husband. Your \u2018old man\u2019 was probably bent out of shape by the realisation that you weren\u2019t his daughter, and your Mom had cheated, which would make it hard to keep going with a fatherhood responsibility, and there\u2019s probably an appropriate AITA for him to post on about how he behaved, and how he felt. Or maybe there\u2019s a chance for you to resolve that with him, if you feel curious to do so. Your future self may be grateful for such resolution.\n\nIf you feel confident that\u2019s not how you feel, then offering a suitable response to persuade mean family members to be quiet should come easily.

I don't understand why everyone's saying the dad is the AH for abandoning the woman that broke his trust. It must've been hard for him to accept the fact that you were not his real daughter. At the same time however, what both your parents did to you was horrible! I can't imagine a 7 year old finding out her dad isn't her dad. You do not owe your dad or his other family anything. I don't think people should blame your mom either. She probably feels a lot of guilt towards the fact that she cheated and feels a need to make up for that. Maybe she thinks this is a way to make up for what she did wrong. I do think it is wrong for her to feel that you owe him anything.", "NTA but he raised you for 7 years and paid child support for another man's kid. The least you could do his hear him out. Imo you owe it to him.", "[deleted]", "I do think you should sit down your brother's and as calmly as you explain that while their struggles and feelings around **their** dad's health, the man has made it clear for over 15 years he has no interest in you. Explain that the more they push the more you're loosing your patience. Explain that you respect and validate their feelings and in turn they need to do the same to you and **stop trying to get you involved**.\n\nWrite a letter if it helps and maybe bring a friend who can pinch you everytime you get (rightfully) angry. This is solely to preserve your relationship with your brother's. \n\nRemind your mother that she might have some guilt towards the man she cheated on. You however are innocent and government mandated child support and the decision to NOT report a crime does not father material make. \n\nFinally, keep doing what feels good for you. If your siblings try to engage in the conversation say \"I respect your relationship with him, respect the fact that I don't have **any** obligation to a man who abandoned me\". \n\nKeep living your life, be happy and this too shall pass.

I can definitely understand why the not-father would have been hurt and angry all those years ago but he was the adult in the situation. He took out his feelings on an innocent child, who loved him as a father. Which is an action that\u2019s within his rights I guess, but the current fall out is well within the expected consequences. As for the \u201cgood points\u201d well child support is his legal obligation and about the car vandalism\u2026 he\u2019d have been the major AH if he had actually pressed charges then lol.

She doesn\u2019t owe him anything. For one if he happened to sign her birth certificate, then he\u2019s obliged by law to pay child support.

He made it clear he isn\u2019t your father and you are 100% right to go along with that now. \n\nIf he wasn\u2019t sick he would never have tried to make you family. This is entirely about his needs and your brother\u2019s needs.\n\nAlso if he really is \u201col mobeybags\u201d then he can pay for a private nurse to help him. Not attempt to sponge off the one person in the world who is least obliged to help him.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom is. I know you don't want to hear it, but she is continuing her AH behavior and weaponizing it against you via manipulation. Her actions caused this rift. Not your 'not dad.' You are not responsible for helping him, but your mom is helping to alleviate her guilt. Her actions ripped the family apart. Someone else got her pregnant, and it was not your 'not dad'. She wants your relationship to improve with him so she feels better about ripping him out of your life. All this 'be the bigger person' is a way to fake a normal family and make her feel better. She hurt her ex-husband, you, and your brothers. She has to live with that.  You have no guilt as you did nothing wrong. That's why you say no so adamantly. \n\nI dont blame your 'not dad' for leaving. It is absolutely horrible to you, but you became a living embodiment of what your mom did. If he did an AITA for leaving, most would vote N T A, and some would criticize leaving you behind. \n\nThis whole situation is above reddits pay grade, but I am willing to bet their is a lot more to the story than you know. I would bet your mom simply has not told you as it makes her look worse. Their is a reason he paid child support (depending on state you can be removed if proven not the parent via dna, or at least could be fought), their is a reason your siblings are on his side, and it sounds like your dad got custody of your brothers and not your mom - their is a reason for this as well. \n\nNTA for wanting nothing to do with him.

If he's rich, what does he need you for? He can hire a car service and a home health aide. Any of the other kids can move back.\n\nI would be curious about what he had to say though. Has the cancer made him regret how he treated you? Is he trying to make amends or just guilt you into free labor? Would you be willing to help if he paid you?\n\nDid you find your biodad?", "NTA. He raised you like his daughter for 7 years and then abandoned you due to something you had no control over. That is really messed up to do to a 7 year old. The part that pushes this past NAH into he's definitely the AH is that he has the audacity to ask you for help without groveling at your feet.\n\nThe only reason I could think of to see him again would be if there was any last things you wanted to say to him before he died.

After all these memories, how can a lack of a biological link change that? I would be beside myself with worry if she was gone.

However I\u2019m going to say he\u2019s potentially not the AH either, finding that out for him would have hit like a tonne of bricks and he reacted badly, given his age handling emotions was never something he was taught and he definitely should have gotten therapy, and it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t be so bad off getting some too. \n\nMortality has a way of bringing perspective to some of these things and it\u2019s likely he hasn\u2019t ever found a way to try and reach out and now that he has this hanging over his head he wants to at least attempt to apologise or make things right. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but speaking as someone who has been a very angry kid in my early 20\u2019s you may regret not having the conversation, especially if he loses this fight.", "NTA.\n\nBut I'm not sure he is either. Finding out that you weren't his child would have been massively hurtful on his part. While I'm sure 7yo you felt betrayed, so did he, and rightly so. His actions to go and raise a stepdaughter your age is also a major kick in the teeth for you. \n\nI can understand him reaching out in need to your mom, and her guilt in helping him. That doesn't mean you have to be the one to help him. You have a boundary here, and your family is trying to tear it down. They are TA here, I judge.\n\nWith all that said, I'd work out if there's anything you want to say to him, or ask him.

Is it because his name is on the birth certificate?

His relationship with her was built on a false premise instead of a genuine one although he was sincere with raising her. The ex wife or mother of OP caused this rift. Don\u2019t get me wrong.

It makes neither of them the AH.\n\nThere are no take-backs from cheating, bearing another person's child and then lying about it for 7 years either. That wrecks a relationship to the point it's better to give up. \n\nBut I come back to the same question; how did he hurt her more than if he involved himself in her life?

Why wouldn't the daughter as well in this scenario? That means he came between mom and daughter and would be brutal towards the mom and would be a dick move since he didn't really have standing to keep her as his daughter unless he stayed with the mother.\n\nI can't see how he demands forgiveness? And even if he didn't she wouldn't be TA if he asked/beg/pleaded either. I just can't see the hate towards the dad. Only the mother seems like an asshole, everyone else is just trying to live with it and the daughter pushed all the resentment of her shitty upbringing on the guy who had the impossible task. But that doesn't make her an AH. \n\nI also think her logic is pretty flawed. \"Money bags\" did one nice thing for her every month for 11 years considering he paid child support in addition to paying for half the car and not press charges (even though he would've been a major asshole if he did).", "Fair enough!

It\u2019s so many stories out there of women being killed for lying about paternity. That\u2019s a very real option. So I feel he did the best option was to remove himself from that situation entirely before things went from bad to worst", "\"Has to?\" No. He did not \"have to\" do anything. But he DID choose to cut off an innocent girl from the man she'd loved as a father. Some men who find out the child they raised since a baby is not genetically theirs manage to keep from punishing the innocent child equally with the guilty mother. He chose not to.\n\nEven stripping out the emotional element and looking at it from the strictly monetary view you're so wedded to, she owes him nothing. He paid the absolute minimum child support he could get away with for a child he was legally responsible for while making her watch him lavishing an education on her brothers and stepsister he refused her. He paid a legal obligation to a child's support while treating her as a stranger. He has no legal right to demand that money back in goods or services. He agreed to not press charges and forgive half the debt of his car vandalism if she paid the other. She paid. Again, no debt owed.  Since he HAS money in abundance, the only monetary reason for him to demand free service from OP is stinginess, and OP has the same right as any stranger in the street to indignantly refuse a rich man the free ride he demands.\n\nI'd guess that with his mortality staring him in the face, it's weighing on his conscience that he wronged OP, and he's groping for some way to talk to her. But an entitled demand to get a free service out of her WHILE he does this is NOT the way to go. I'd agree with the poster who advises she request he pay for her therapy as a reasonable way for her to recover from the trauma of the relationship he broke and decide if she can reestablish it, before he starts asking her for favors.", "I agree with you up  until the last line.  He's not entitled to ask for something from her because he paid child support.  OP is innocent this mess. They have no relationship. I don't know why he chose to pay child support rather than fight it, but that doesn't entitle him to ask OP for her time.  He can demand things of his ex-wife till the cows come home, but he should leave OP alone.", "I don't think that's how most people see the world though.\n\nYou don't have an obligation to protect all children around the world, or even all children that you know. You *do* have an obligation to protect your biological children, and children you voluntarily accept responsibility for.\n\nIn cases like this, the mother failed her duty to protect her biological child right at the start. The father who was tricked into accepting responsibility for that child isn't in the wrong for withdrawing his consent when he has the truth. It is quite literally her fault. Without the initial lie, they wouldn't be in this position to begin with.\n\n> And he did voluntarily enter this situation, \n\nHe literally didn't though. You can't agree to a situation based on false pretenses and then claim that it's voluntary. \n\nHe was told a child was his. Therefore he has an automatic responsibility for it.\n\nHe later finds out it wasn't his, and he never voluntarily chose to take care of a child that wasn't his, so he is not obligated to do so.\n\nAs an example:\n\nI tell you that I've signed a house over to you and you own it from now on, but it needs some roofing work done. You do the roofing work because you own the house, it's your responsibility. You carry on paying all house liabilities. \n\nBut 7 years later I say \"sorry dude, I actually never transferred ownership of the house to you. I lied to you about that\".\n\nI then ask you to pay for the plumbing to be fixed too.\n\nAre you just going to say \"welp, I accepted the responsibility voluntarily so I guess I'll just have to pay for it\" or are you going to claim that because that responsibility was based on a lie, you do not need to continue it?", "It\u2019s simple.

If deathbed guilt is causing him to want to make ammends, and he's as wealthy as you say, then allowing him to try to buy your forgiveness might work out well for you.
