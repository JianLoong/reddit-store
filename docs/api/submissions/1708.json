Good on you for keeping him away from her.", "NTA I\u2019m guessing when he says \u201cclosure\u201d he means he wants to yell at her when she\u2019s too weak to yell back and thereby win the fight", "NTA, YWBTA if you overode a dying women's wishes by letting a visitor in because she was too unwell to answer the door herself. She chose not to see him.", "100% he didn't want closure, he wanted the last word.\n\nMy therapist always says you don't actually need to talk to the other person for closure, or to get them to forgive you so you can move on. There are other ways of processing your own feelings without involving someone else. \n\nOP is NTA and probably avoided a huge horrible blow out. Even if the mom was toxic too, she still deserved a little peace in her last few days.", "NTA. No good comes of this, only extra pain. It\u2019s always about someone hurting the dying person on their way out with some extra jabs and rants and who knows what blaming. You did right.", "NTA\n\n\"closure\" is a myth that TV and self help books have sold us but it is not a real thing. You're good.", "NTA. The decision was solely your mother's and she made it. Your father wanting \"closure\" should have done that in the many years before she died. This is a *him* problem, not a you problem.", "you said it all and quite eloquently NTA", "Your parents had every opportunity to acheive \"closure\" over many years. It was not your responsibility to trample over the wishes of a dyung woman. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou are right.  He had time before.  Her death wasn't about him or his wants.  It was about her needs.   \n\nNow, it's about your grief.  If he brings it up again, it's okay to say something like \"I'm not discussing this.\"  And if he won't stop bringing it up, it's okay to cut short any conversation and exit.", "Nta. Tell him to go to her grave and talk to her just like everybody else does", "NTA. ABSOLUTELY NTA. You did the right thing by giving your Mother what she wanted at the end of her life. You were right, her death was not about your Dad and his closure. It was about your Mother and her peace.", "NTA. Your mum made her wishes very clear in regards to your dad. It was her choice and you simply acted as she wished. Your dad has no right to be angry at you.", "NTA  he had plenty of time for \" closure\".", "NTA", "nope you are a good daughter. NTA", "Please, OP, get some therapy. Your parents have you twisted inside out. You owe them nothing. But you owe yourself a better outlook and future. I hope you can begin to heal. \n\nNTA", "While I was reading the father daughter exchange I thought to myself at this point it would be lovely if pops said to the daughter, \"I respect that I can't see your mother, will you tell her I'm sorry for all the sorrow I caused her through the years and I take total blame and I pray that mom forgives me \" :)", "Thank you.", "Thank you very much.", ">Did your father want closure or did he want to have the final say? \n\nAt the time when my father was calling me about this, I was feeling very overwhelmed with caring for my mother. I probably didn't hear or process what he was saying very well. Looking back now, I don't even remember the exact words he used except he kept saying that this was his last chance for \"closure\". \n\nI read how commenters are saying he just wanted to have the last word, and in a way I think they are right. That's his personality. Even if he apologized to my mother for all the years of fighting he would have found a way to twist the knife a little bit too. And besides, he could offer the most perfect apology, and it wouldn't change the fact that my mother didn't want to see him, period!", "I'm planning to put in my will/funeral wishes that my ex husband is not allowed to attend, should he outlive me. He would ABSOLUTELY show up and make it all about him.", "Thank you. It was a rough relationship in many ways but I did love my mother. I'm glad in the end that I was able to show her that. I think she felt it.", "Thank you for saying that. That's what I thought too, that a person who is dying gets to make the decision! I couldn't understand why my father thought it was up for discussion or debate.", "Right now he is not happy with me at all. When we do interact it is so that he can list old grievances, ways I have disappointed him or sided with other people against him over the years. I don't know if there is any way to fix it. He thinks I chose my mother over him at the very end and he can't forgive me.", "Oh that made me laugh. Thanks, maybe I will tell him that!", "I like your therapist", "When someone's wishes regarding illness or death are counter to the societal norm it can cause a lot of uncertainty for the family/caregiver. We're raised with social norms so going against that, even as someone's dying wish, can be hard to process. \n\nThe guilt trip she's getting only makes it worse, honestly. You want to believe the best of people, but the father clearly doesn't have good intentions.", "By any chance, does he think closure is the same thing as getting the closing remark in an argument? Because I really think all he wanted is to be able to get the last word in an argument that had gone on for years (even decades?)", "Nta.  Very sorry for your loss", "NTA. if she didn't want to see him then you did the right thing.", "NTA you said it best. He had years and years to find closure and he chose to continue hurtful comments and perpetuate the feud instead. You did the right thing respecting her wishes and allowing her peace in her final days", "NTA. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t your decision to make. \nYou did the right thing.", "NTA", "NTA. You were honoring your dying mother's last request. Your dad can yell at the empty air if he wants to, not harass his estranged wife on her deathbed.", "NTA, NTA, NTA. What an awful situation for you to have to manage.  \n\nI hope your father at least goes NC with you so you get a chance at some personally restorative peace.  \n\nAlso NTA.", "NTA. \n\"The only reason you wanted in there is one final dig at her. ITS OVER. MOVE ON. I am SICK of your BS. Stop it or I go complete NC with you.\"", "You did the right thing.", "NTA. He basically wanted to take the chance to service his own emotions when she was dying. Literally everything he is saying 'I need more me time'.\n\nYou respected your mother's wishes, and didn't allow him to disrespect her in her final days.", "NTA. You're a good daughter", "NTA. My family went thru something similar when my grandmother passed; she was petrified her son (my uncle who we are NC with) would visit because he was so awful. I know how it feels to try and uphold someone's dying wish like that. I'm sorry that's what you went thru and I hope your father comes to understand this on some level because you didn't do it to be cruel. Sometimes things in life don't have closure. My best to you.", "Yeah, the father would make a big scene- either pretending to be a grieving widower needing sympathy or yelling about how awful his wife was.", "NTA.  You are correct.  It was her decision and her right to choose who to have near on her last days.", "NTA you did such a kind and righteous thing for your mother helping her pass peacefully.", "He didn't want closure, he wanted to make sure her final days were full of his vitriol. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think he wanted \u201cclosure\u201d, he wanted the last word", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss, my condolences to you and your family. \n\nYou honored your mother's wishes.  Don't feel guilty.  \n\nYour father seeking closure may have been arguing with your mom to get in the last word.\n\nDon't think about it.", "Or how awful thee daughter was to not let him see the mother", "NTA\n\nHe can get closure at the funeral or grave site. He didn't need to violate the boundaries of a woman he hadn't been separated from for decades.\n\nSorry for your loss, and sorry your dad is being an asshat during an already difficult time.", "NTA and POOR SELFISH DAD didn't get his way.  TOO FUCKING bad.  I am so sorry about your mom and PROUD that you did as she asked.", "You're right. People who want reconciliation, would not throw tantrums or get angry. So, dad's \"closure\" was intended to be nothing of the sort. I dread to think what it would look like.  \n\nMy guess is \"dad\" would read a list of things mom was \"guilty of\" and then proclaim dramatically: \"But I forgive you!\" or even demand her to say \"sorry\"  so that she could die \"with clear consciousness\". Horrible creature.", "That's awful. You can't spend your life trying to please someone who can't be pleased. If he wants to wreck any chance of a relationship with you I'm afraid there's not much you can do other than protect yourself by staying away from him.", "NTA.", "NTA", "They both suck tho. I mean, imagine LITERALLY wasting your entire life on hating someone and thus emotionally damaging every family member around you. Gross.", "I know, right?"]}
