Also, your father's anger is very telling. It was never about your mother for him. Even his \"closure\" is all about him. Good for you that you honoured your mom's wish and prevented yet another drama. My suspicion that he wanted to have one last dig at her when she was in such a vulnerable position and couldn't fight back.", "NTA.  He had his entire life to 'get closure', instead he chose it to talk shit about her, and put you and your siblings in the middle.\n\nShe explicitly told you, as she was dying, that she didn't want to see him or talk to him.  You were carrying out her wishes. That's a kindness, I might add, that a lot of people wouldn't have done since she put you in the middle of their arguments too.\n\nHe's angry with you because he didn't get his way so he could have the very last word.  I guarantee you'll become the next target of his vitriol, because he sounds like a miserable human being.", "They had literal decades to reconcile before this and instead chose to put you and others in the middle of their petty arguments, and you\u2019re right that your mother\u2019s death was not about him. Look at it this way: If you had let him visit her she would have been agitated and upset seeing him and then she would\u2019ve spent however many days she had left after feeling hurt and betrayed by you because you didn\u2019t respect her dying wish. Given that, I think you did the right thing by respecting her wishes and it doesn\u2019t matter if your father can\u2019t understand why she wanted that. NTA\n\np.s. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, I hope you have a good day.", "NTA - you were respecting your mother\u2019s wishes. Him wanting closure is him being selfish.", "I am sorry about your loss. Take the time to grieve. \n\nAs for your father, NTA. Your mother\u2019s wish was to not see him. You fulfilled that wish. And you\u2019re right. They had decades.", "NTA. You took care of your mother and fulfilled her wishes. That is what\u2019s most important. You don\u2019t know what kind of \u201cclosure\u201d your father wanted, there\u2019s no guarantee it wouldn\u2019t have been a final jab at her.

As you say, he had plenty of time to patch things up.  Also, you could not have known that your father would not have used the opportunity to win the last argument or have the last word.", "NTA.\n\nYou were right to honor her wishes. Your dad will have to find closure some other way.  Upsetting her in her dying days was not the way to achieve that.", "Well, at least they got to play out their dynamic until the end. Mom hating dad, dad trying to override mom's decisions and putting you as the go between.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour mom's wish, as you said, was to never see/speak with your father again. Given the history those two had, I see why she would make such a request. I feel sorry that you were thrust in the middle of all that. I can only imagine what sort of \"closure\" your dad wanted with your mom.", "NTA\n\nYour mother's dying wishes trump what he wants. She couldn't have been clearer, she didn't want him there. He has no right to steamroll over her dying wishes. He doesn't care about what she wanted, he just wants to make himself feel better by getting closure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents are children and/or cowards using a middleman to deliver toxic messages to each other. It's sad they're still being childish/cowardly and can't actually face each other.

Human beings don't have an undeniable right to closure.

A friend of mine's father was dying, she called me distraught because he didn't want to see anyone, but family was bothering her about saying one last good bye. I told her when someone is passing they get to say how it will go, no one else - she could pass along the message but she needed to follow her father's wishes. All he wanted was to be at home with her at his side. She did just that, no regrets. You're a wonderful daughter for putting your mother first and allowing her peace at the end.", "You were carrying out dying wishes, that makes you NTA. If your dad really cared about your mom in any capacity, he should have made amends decades ago. But instead, he steadfastly refused to make tiny concessions, continued to put you in the middle, and refused to make even token peace offerings until it was too late for him.\n\nIt would be different if your mom had also wanted to see him, and you were the sole blocker.

He would have used any situation to pariah your mom. Dad deserves nothing but his pen horrible thoughts about his actions were his own and he is the only one accountable and responsible.", "NTA - You said it yourself OP, \"if they had wanted closure they had decades to work it out...\" Unfortunately for your father, he has to live with the knowledge that whatever was unresolved between them will remain unresolved. No last laughs or winners, only losers in bitterness.\n\nBest of luck going forward OP.
