Also, your father's anger is very telling. It was never about your mother for him. Even his \"closure\" is all about him.

A friend of mine's father was dying, she called me distraught because he didn't want to see anyone, but family was bothering her about saying one last good bye. I told her when someone is passing they get to say how it will go, no one else - she could pass along the message but she needed to follow her father's wishes. All he wanted was to be at home with her at his side. She did just that, no regrets. You're a wonderful daughter for putting your mother first and allowing her peace at the end.", "You were carrying out dying wishes, that makes you NTA.

He would have used any situation to pariah your mom. Dad deserves nothing but his pen horrible thoughts about his actions were his own and he is the only one accountable and responsible.", "NTA - You said it yourself OP, \"if they had wanted closure they had decades to work it out...\" Unfortunately for your father, he has to live with the knowledge that whatever was unresolved between them will remain unresolved. No last laughs or winners, only losers in bitterness.\n\nBest of luck going forward OP. I hope your father can see that putting you in between his and your mother's venom was the ultimate AH move.", "NTA.  You definitely made the right decision.", "NTA.\n\nOnce your mother said she didn't want to see your father, the question was closed.

Did your father want closure or did he want to have the final say?  Because it sounds like the latter. You used words like \"persuade\" and \"force\" which are aggressive words for someone looking for closure.

Not that my now-spouse would allow it, hut just in case.", "If anything, he needs to apologize to you for making you a go between all those years and again.

You honored a dying persons requests. We have this situation in my family but the other way around. \n\nMy Mother in Law wanted closure with my Father in Law ( who was dying).  She asked to see him at the end, and that man used one of his dying breaths to tell her to go *#\u20ac herself and that she deserved to spend the rest of her life living with guilt, knowing it was all her fault, and she would never be absolved from it.  Honestly, beautiful.  MIL deserved that, though they both spent their entire adult lives being petty and vindictive with each other.  \n\nIt has been 10 years and she is still obsessed by it.

You gave a dying woman calm and peace during her final hours. You gave yourself calm and peace, by refusing to invite your father into your home to antagonize your mother. Yes, he is antagonizing you now, but you can go NC for a while again if needed. Put the screaming toddler in timeout.\n\nHe harps on about needing closure? I'd ask him: What Closure?
