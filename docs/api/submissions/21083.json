My wife is a SAHM.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve two boys with my ex wife and a boy and a girl with my wife, in that order. The boys primarily live with their mom.\n\nI want all my assets to be divided equally among all four of my children. I feel a duty towards all of them equally. However my wife feels our mutual kids should get more % because my exwife has done quite nicely for herself and the boys are set for life. Me and my wife aren\u2019t close to poor but definitely not at the level of my exwife who has always been really good with money. Neither of us pays child support to the other because although they live with her most of the time she does make a lot more money. I have always felt guilty that in effect she has contributed the most to bringing up the boys, both labor and money while i saw them a couple times a year at most.\n\nMy wife is a SAHM and worked part time for a while when the kids were about 6-7 then decided she didn\u2019t want to go to work anymore. In essence all the cash of our household comes from me so you can tell we\u2019re not exactly rich like the boys mom. Except the house and the joint bank account for household expenses most of the money is under my name only. Ive arranged for my share to go evenly to four parties and my wife share to go to the mutual kids only.\n\nI will not receive anything if she passes first and vice versa.\n\nMy wife thinks I am converting her household labor to cash and giving it to my exwife which makes no sense to me. While I value her contributions to everything she did benefit from living without a job for so long and continues to do so. I do not mind providing for her. So it felt unfair to say I was exploiting her. And my exwife is mot receiving any money from me whatsoever only my sons are.\n\nmy wife thinks i shouldnt leave anything to the boys because they already received emotional heirlooms from my mother who sadly passed on before our kids were born. They do not have too much monetary value because they shouldn\u2019t be sold anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nextra info: essentially I don\u2019t see why the my son+daughter should get extra. If I had sent childsupport to the boys mom i wouldn\u2019t feel so bad. My exwife did more for my kids with her than my wife did for our mutual kids because I was a very involved parent.

Your children are all equally yours different mothers or not, so you're right to want to treat them equally.", "So she wants to short change your other kids because your ex made good financial decisions?\n\nIf she wants her kids to be in equal footing with your other kids then maybe she should do what your ex wife did and provide for her family financially. If she doesn\u2019t want to work, then she should live with the consequences of her decision.\n\nNTA.", "NTA You\u2019re doing the right thing. They\u2019re all your children. Treat them all equally", "NTA they are all your children and it's the right thing to do. Good for you for taking a stand", "Info: So you are not leaving any inheritance to your wife? Did I get that right?", "Info: how old are your children with your current wife?", "INFO: you're not leaving your wife anything in the event of your premature death?!", "NTA. This should not be negotiable. Tell your wife that each of your children will get equal amounts and you will not understand any circumstances have it any other way at. Tell her your ex wife\u2019s is hers to do with as she pleases and she doesn\u2019t have the right to devalue your children inheritance because she feels she is entitled to say how your ex spends her money. \n\nOP can you imagine how you children with your ex would feel if you died and they found out you willed them less than your children with your current wife. I shutter to think of it. They would be so hurt and angry with you! You say you are an involved parent; then, prove it. Take care of all your children equally and without prejudice. This is only right!", "I think you should consider leaving your current wife something. Being a Sahm she\u2019s giving up years she would otherwise be putting into a career and this will negatively impact her earnings potential if something happens to you.", "NTA, but your wife is. It isn\u2019t about the money for the boys but knowing that in your eyes, they are just as valuable as your second family. And you don\u2019t know if something happens and whatever you ex has could be gone.\n\nYou are doing the right thing? Maybe just say nothing to your wife about it anymore. But honestly, her views and reactions would give me room for pause and wonder how she really feels about the older two.", "Did your wife do anything while being a SAHM that you otherwise would have paid someone else for? Like childcare? If so then her contributions were unpaid labor and therefore some of your salary should\u2019ve gone to her.", "NTA for the dividing things up equally thing, but I will point out you're kinda being an AH about wife #2 being a SAHM.  \n\nIt's not an easy job and you're essentially only \"paying\" her room and board, since you're hoarding all the money that doesn't go to bills.  Not cool.", "NTA.\n\nYou have four children, so they should inherit equally from you. Each of your children has another parent to inherit from, it\u2019s up to that parent what they have to leave. Even if your wife doesn\u2019t work outside the home, she could, for example, take out a life insurance policy to benefit her children. \n\nIt sounds like it would be fair to say that the children of your current marriage benefit more from your income on a day to day basis than your children by your former wife. \n\nIf you had to total the amount of money you contributed to the upbringing of each set of children, and the amount of time spent with each set of children, who comes out ahead?", "NTA for dividing up your assets equally amongst your children. But it's a little strange and kind of AH behavior for you to not leave anything to your current wife except the house and a joint household expenses bank account. Especially when your children are still under 18. Is your house paid off? How much is your life insurance policy worth? Sounds like she will be in a pretty bad financial situation without any job experience, savings, 401k, etc if something happens to you", "YTA  for leaving your wife nothing.  The house and bank accounts are in your name. \nIf your assets are evenly  divided  between  the children, the house will probsbly be sold and  money divided. \n\nWhere will your wife and two youngest live? Do you have college funds set aside? Life insurance for your wife to raise  the children?\n\nNTA  for dividing money to all your kids.  Doesn't matter if your ex  makes a decent living.", "NTA you have no idea what will happen in the future. Your ex could lose everything, she might remarry and leave it all to her new hubby, the kids could face any number of currently unknown financial setbacks while the second set could win the lottery. But you know what you know for sure right now? They are all your kids. Treat them equally. It\u2019s what they deserve.", "NTA- Doing it her way would only cause unnecessary resentment between all your children. Equal shares all around. She gets her cut and split the rest.", "NTA. It is good to leave things equally to all your children. Your wife did work and she did have at least a part time job at one point. Your kids are now old enough where she can go back to work slowly and even if she did, she can agree to save her money for herself and contribute to the household maybe a little less than a full SAHM. She can definitely figure things out and even find herself and do something she loves. I strongly advise any woman to not solely rely on a man 100% even if you set aside some money in a separate account just for her to save for any type of rainy day. She should have that and she should be prepared for anything to happen. Even if you did split it 5 ways, I'm sure that money would run out and she would have to find a way to support herself after that.", "Tell Lady Tremaine her children had the benefit of a full time father. The children from your first marriage did not. Hence the inequality of the children was baked in on the side of hers.\n\nDon\u2019t let her convince you to favor your younger children over your older children just because she\u2019s jealous of your ex-wife\u2019s money.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What you leave behind should be shared by all your kids equally. You\u2019re doing the right thing. OP. Please don\u2019t make your wife the executor of your will.", "NTA. dont listen to your wife lol", "NTA treating all your children equally is absolutely what you should do, regardless of whether you paid children support or not. If all four were your wife\u2019s biological children this wouldn\u2019t even be a question so why is it when they are all YOUR biological children. If your wife chose to be a SAHM and because of that her biological kids are getting less than her step kids (according to her), then that\u2019s on her and not you.", "Your wife is trying to alienate you from your kids with your ex-wife. She\u2019s out of line. Do you love your older kids less? \n\nNTA", "NTA, your wife is the stereotypical step mother who thinks her kids deserve more. Your kids should get equal parts. If your wife wants her kids to have more, tell her to go back to work to provide the home with a better living.", "Your wife is really nailing the whole Disney Wicked step mom thing, LOL.  Seriously, leaving an unequal inheritance will leave your older children feeling like the \"less than\" family-- if that's how you want them to view your relationship with you then go for it-- but it doesn't sound like that is your agenda.  Your children may not inherit anything from their mom.  A serious illness or disability could exhaust all of her resources and they'd be left with nothing.  Please don't let your wife's greed hurt your older children.  Split the inheritance equally and then you'll be NTA", "Nta your wife is being greedy and hoping to bum off what you have left when you pass. Tell her to get her ass up and get a job if she\u2019s worried about her future without your financial support. If she wants her kids to get more, then you can offer to back pay all the child support that you\u2019d technically owe and will leave your wife with no spending money, resulting in her having to get a job to pick up the rest of the bills. Stand your ground.", "She decided to be a SAHM when the kids were 6 and 7? But they are in school majority of the day and you said you are a present father.. so what is she doing as a SAHM? NTA. Just because your ex does well financially doesn\u2019t mean you should treat your boys any less", "NTA. They are all your kids and should each get an equal part of your inheritance.", "NTA. The background of your children's financial statuses or previous inheritances is irrelevant. Your four children are equally your four children. They deserve equal shares of your inheritance. Now your wife doesn't have to provide heirlooms or an inheritance to them, so I get her issue with that since your finances are combined, but that's what happens when you comingle finances. Your two children from your previous marriage would always know they got less, and that's not something they need to deal with while grieving. They need to know you love them as much as your children from your current wife.", "YTA - at this point.  \n\nYour children with your wife are minors. If you die how will that household be supported?   Since she\u2019s been a sahm her earning potential has been decimated for years.
