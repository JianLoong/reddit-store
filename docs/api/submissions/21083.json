My wife is a SAHM.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve two boys with my ex wife and a boy and a girl with my wife, in that order. The boys primarily live with their mom.\n\nI want all my assets to be divided equally among all four of my children. I feel a duty towards all of them equally. However my wife feels our mutual kids should get more % because my exwife has done quite nicely for herself and the boys are set for life. Me and my wife aren\u2019t close to poor but definitely not at the level of my exwife who has always been really good with money. Neither of us pays child support to the other because although they live with her most of the time she does make a lot more money. I have always felt guilty that in effect she has contributed the most to bringing up the boys, both labor and money while i saw them a couple times a year at most.\n\nMy wife is a SAHM and worked part time for a while when the kids were about 6-7 then decided she didn\u2019t want to go to work anymore. In essence all the cash of our household comes from me so you can tell we\u2019re not exactly rich like the boys mom. Except the house and the joint bank account for household expenses most of the money is under my name only. Ive arranged for my share to go evenly to four parties and my wife share to go to the mutual kids only.\n\nI will not receive anything if she passes first and vice versa.\n\nMy wife thinks I am converting her household labor to cash and giving it to my exwife which makes no sense to me. While I value her contributions to everything she did benefit from living without a job for so long and continues to do so. I do not mind providing for her. So it felt unfair to say I was exploiting her. And my exwife is mot receiving any money from me whatsoever only my sons are.\n\nmy wife thinks i shouldnt leave anything to the boys because they already received emotional heirlooms from my mother who sadly passed on before our kids were born. They do not have too much monetary value because they shouldn\u2019t be sold anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nextra info: essentially I don\u2019t see why the my son+daughter should get extra. If I had sent childsupport to the boys mom i wouldn\u2019t feel so bad. My exwife did more for my kids with her than my wife did for our mutual kids because I was a very involved parent.

She can definitely figure things out and even find herself and do something she loves. I strongly advise any woman to not solely rely on a man 100% even if you set aside some money in a separate account just for her to save for any type of rainy day.

But if they do so, then treat the fact that the laundry is done as some massive selfless sacrifice they incurred to enable the working partner to even... *function*, then they're full of it.", "He says specifically that if he dies she gets nothing and if he dies she gets nothing. \n\nI'm not forgetting shit.", "NTA. And it's none of your wife's business what you leave to your children from your ex, and your ex's assets are none of her business either. If she wants her kids to have more she can go get a job. Honestly she sounds a bit like a money grabber.", "You know the wife is not going to give anything to the other kids", "Or should he pass before his wife, then she gets 25% the two kids they share will get 25% and the two kids with the ex get 50% because the 25% the current wife gets will be then shared between the two kids they share.\n\nBut if he passes after his wife, then 50% and 50% or 25% to each kid.", "But isnt that kind of what he does? He leave his HALF to all chidren. And should the wife pass first, her HALF goes to their 2 chidren.", "that's what he says. their wealth is divided 50%/50% atm. if he dies he wants his share to go to his 4 kids. she still has her share", "She chose and continues to choose to not work.  I have a feeling their kids are old enough not to need full time care like that.", "I think that given that his wife isn't complaining about what he's leaving her (she's complaining about what the kids get) that we can safely assume that she's happy with what she's getting in the event of his death. She doesn't sound like the kind of person who's afraid to speak up for herself.", "But she only stopped working when they were 6-7. I'd agree usually, being a stay at home parent for a while it may be hard to work again. I've no sympathy for her here, she worked until childcare got easier so then stopped? Then dictates finances that aren't hers, for children who aren't hers.", "I work full time and cook/clean the fuck are you on about it\u2019s not 40 hours work and is actually \u201ceasy\u201d compared to actual work.", "Are you seriously trying to argue that her picking up after herself in the day when the kids are at school and he is at work is somehow a bigger benefit to him than if she was actually a working, contributing adult?", "You take care of two kids full time too?", "Also if its shitty quality life insurance they may not pay out at all depending on how he dies", "And both kids are in full time education. I don't want to be judgmental but I wonder what all this household labour she speaks of actually entails.", "They're teenagers. Don't take much looking after", "So what, she should call it lost cause and just never ever work for the rest of her life? I agree that being SAHP is job at itself, but you have to accept that you work for pennies and it doesn't count towards your CV and pension. That's why most women go back to work once the kids are old enough that don't require constant attention. \n\nI have no idea how OPs will works, it definitely doesn't sound legal according to laws where I'm from since you just can't disinherit spouse. But OP didn't said anything about his wife complaining about no money for her, only about same amount of money for all his kids instead of their kids having more. Which is totally fair, both sets of kids have their own mother and shared father. What the ex gives or doesn't give to her own kids should be no concern of the current wife. She can provide extra for her own children too. If OP tried to somehow count the financial situation of his ex and provide that amount more to his other kids his ex would basically financially support them while his current wife does nothing. Which is pretty much how it goes right now anyway, since OP doesn't pay child support and his ex support their kids single-handedly."]}
