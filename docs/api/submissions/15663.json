His dad died when he was young. His older brother, Martin, was definitely parentified and became the \u201cman of the house.\u201d\n\nTogether, Dan and I have 3 children: Sydney (12F), Gabe (10M) and Charlotte (3F). Unfortunately, Dan passed away 3 months ago. It\u2019s been a terrible struggle trying to balance my grief, my children\u2019s on top of the rest of the responsibilities. I have a great support system, so I have been cognizant to make sure my babies still have a childhood. I always said I wouldn\u2019t do what my MIL did.\n\nRecently, I was having a bit of a tough time. Charlotte was sick, Sydney is in about a million activities and the housework was piling up. Martin\u2019s wife, Rachel, offered to come by and help me out. She generously cleaned the house and looked after Charlotte while I ran Sydney to her activities. When I arrived back home, I found Martin and Gabe in the kitchen. Martin was telling him that it shouldn\u2019t have gotten to this stressful point and he should be helping me more. He told him that he was the man of the house and it was up to him to step up.\n\nI cut in and told Gabe to not listen to his uncle, that he is a little boy and it is NOT his job to take over for his father. Rather, it\u2019s his job to play, go to school and just be a kid. I sent him to play. I tore into Martin. I asked him how dare he say that to my son?! I said he may have been parentified but he will NOT do the same to my son. I said if he pulled crap like that again, he\u2019d never see my kids again. Martin told me I was being ungrateful, he was only trying to help. He said more than anything, he was defending his wife as it\u2019s not her job to help me. I reminded him I never asked Rachel for help, she offered. Martin said she wouldn\u2019t have if I wasn\u2019t complaining about how hard my life is.\n\nSince, Dan\u2019s family has been telling me what a bitch I am. They say this is all Martin knows and I was way too harsh on him, especially threatening to cut him off. They told me I need to get my shit together. My MIL especially thinks I need to suck it up and expect my kids (not just Gabe, but Sydney too) to help me with Charlotte. I told her off and that only made it worse.\n\nEveryone is accusing me of alienating Dan\u2019s family, which I\u2019m not trying to do. AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify: My children do have chores and help around the house. The work in question was things that are out of their age bracket and were my responsibility. Thus why I was falling behind considering I also have to take care of the kids, drive them places and do more things that are not age appropriate or their job.", "created_utc": 1682446169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yr59c/aita_for_snapping_at_my_bil_and_threatening_to/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You handled the situation poorly and escalated it needlessly\u2026.but I think it\u2019s understandable given your loss.

Unfortunately, your BIL has a different view of a male child\u2019s responsibility in a situation like this because of how he was raised. I imagine that he\u2019s proud that he was able to \u201cstep up\u201d and help his mom after his dad died. He\u2019s not alone in this way of thinking. Before I get attacked, I want to make clear that I 100% agree with you that children should get to be children (at least whenever possible).

You completely overreacted in threatening to cut BIL off from your kids. If you want to piss off your husband's side of the family, this is the way to do it.

You'd think and hope your in-laws would be understanding of that. But then, they're grieving, too. They lost a son and a brother and probably aren't at their best, either.\n\nI suggest meeting up in whatever combination you feel most comfortable - all together or one on one - and apologize for the way you treated Martin but explain that you don't want your son to feel like it's his job to take on a household leadership role at this age. You want him to still be able to live his life as a kid with age-appropriate responsibilities, not have extra foisted upon him just because he's the one in the house with a penis. (Maybe don't word it exactly like that, because straight up accusing them of being sexist isn't the best idea if you want to have a relationship. Attitudes like that don't generally come from a  conscious \"women are inferior!\" belief but rather just...being how they were brought up.)\n\nAnd thank them for their help, but impress upon them that your household rules are the rules, and if they can't respect that, then your interactions going forward might be limited.

As much as I'm sure you want life to be able to continue on just like normal for everyone...it's not normal.

Stay strong on those boundaries. \n\nOn a side note if you and the kids aren\u2019t getting grief counseling I would suggest doing that. It\u2019s so helpful.", "NTA you should be getting help from adults not kids, it\u2019s great you know that. Honestly, cut cut cut and figure it out later who you want to let back in later but you don\u2019t have to listen to them and after they give their opinion they need to step back.", "NTA. If Martin is used to being \u201cman of the house,\u201d then he should stop being a whiny B when he gets told off for overstepping his boundaries.", "The oldest can probably wash and fold their own laundry too but your doing amazing. Keep up those healthy boundaries.", "NTA.  It takes a village, especially when you lose a spouse.  It was not his place to tell your 10yr old he needed to be \"the man of the house\" and to \"step-up\".  He's freaking 10!  Plus, they need to realize that their way of child-rearing is not the same as yours.", "NTA\n\nAre you in the US? If so your children qualify for SSI survivor benefits. Use some of that to hire maybe a one day a week help to deep clean etc. You are doing your absolute best. I can\u2019t fathom the level of AH your ILs are to say some of the things you mentioned.", "NTA, god work letting your children be children even after everything you have been through. You are a good mum.", "Nta", "NTA, BUT, you do need to get your shit together. Listen I get it you don't want to abuse your kids that's beautiful man. But it appears that your family may feel like you are are abusing them. Hence why Martin felt like he had to step in and say something. They have their own lives too, just like you. Like most people they waited until it bubbled over. Not ok. They should have said something to AND ADULT. But they snapped and went after your kiddo. You went full mama bear, understandable. But I'm sure they are gonna use this as an excuse to wash their hands of the situation. If you don't want their opinions great, but don't expect help. If somone is helping even if offered, they have every right to have an opinion on a situation that is now their problem.", "NTA.\n\nI don't understand the YTA and ESH votes. They seem to think that it was somehow justifiable for Martin to say what he did to a grieving child who's *effing ten years old*. And the fact that he made sure to do it while OP was out of the house makes me think that he knew (on some level, anyway) that what he was doing was wrong.\n\nIn regards to the MIL, she doesn't get to talk, since her shit parenting is likely the reason that Martin thought pulling a stunt like this was OK in the first place.\n\nAlso:\n\n>I reminded him I never asked Rachel for help, she offered. Martin said she wouldn\u2019t have if I wasn\u2019t complaining about how hard my life is.\n\nWho even says that to a woman who just lost her husband?", "Excellent point that OP could use if husband\u2019s family weren\u2019t so blind to the abuse that MIL inflicted.  I\u2019d be hard pressed to have them continue in our lives at all if someone told me to \u201cget my shit together\u201d in this situation.", "Time to go very LC with all of your in-laws, at least for a little while.  Hang in there OP and I\u2019m so sorry for your family\u2019s loss!", "Absolutely! Choose this hill to die on, OP (Sorry for the tasteless idiom in context of your post)\n\nNTA.", "F*** yes. Amen.", "To clarify, my kids do help around the house. They clean their rooms, take turns loading the dishwasher (the older two anyway), putting them away, etc.\n\nThe housework in question was deep cleaning, stuff they could not reasonably do at their age.", "Yikes, yeah, that\u2019s exactly what happened. It lead to a few arguments and she only ended up \u201chelping\u201d with my eldest, as I was  \u201cungrateful\u201d for actually wanting to bond with my baby. And keep in mind, I never asked her to do housework unless she specifically asked what I needed.\n\nMy kids also have chores, just not to the level of things I had to get done.", "Husband : where are you going ?\n\nWife : at OP's. I offered to help her with some cleaning. It's not easy for since your brother died. She's \u00e0 little overwhelmed.\n\nHusband : But... who is going to cook my dinner ?", "I usually have a sitter that helps me with my youngest but she doesn\u2019t work when she\u2019s sick. That\u2019s the only reason why I was falling behind.\n\nThat being said, I am looking into a house cleaner.", "And the kid is **10**!! It is absolutely not okay (or at all helpful) to tell a 10 year old, whose dad just died that he has to now shoulder adult responsibilities. Good grief.\n\nNTA, OP.", "The kid is also freaking 10. This is so toxic and I hate how this is such a trope in movies and shows for kids whose parent's are passing away.", "Agreed. \n\nI'd apologize for losing your cool (though it's totally understandable considering everything you're going through) but that you stand by the boundaries you set. Make sure those boundaries are clear moving forward and as long as they stick to them, there's no need for further issues. Forgive each other for poor reactions during a hard time and just try to move forward the best you all can.", "Yup and who the heck changes their argument into \"I was protecting my wife\" in this situation? So his wife, who offered to help recently widowed mother of 3 for one day, needed protection so much that he had to emotionally abuse a 10-year old? These are not good people OP,  start putting distance between your family and them.", ">However tearing into Martin was a huge overreaction he was only trying to help\n\nFirst off, Martin's *wife* was helping. By the sound of it, Martin himself hasn't done anything. \n\nSecond, please explain how it was helpful for Martin to try to add to the burden of a grieving ten-year-old.", "This is not about different viewpoints though. It is not ok to try to parentify a 10 year old 3 months after their dad died and tell them he needs to act as his dad, the man of the house, especially when he approaches it by blaming the kid on things \"getting that far\". Absolutely NTA.", "Her husband literally died 3 months ago and she's taking care of 3 kids who's dad just died I'm betting she didn't alienate shit and they're just mad she's not being a happy wife anymore because of her grief", "You completely ignored my edit (which was made before your essay) that said my children do have chores. The ones my SIL were helping with were MY personal chores that are out of the scope of their level.

You\u2019re wrong.", "They were not basic tasks. My children could not have done them as they involved materials kids shouldn\u2019t be using. \n\nActivities do not need to be adjusted. I was only having a hard time as my youngest was sick, babysitter understandably didn\u2019t want to look after an ill child. So, I was on my own.

The housework at hand was deep cleaning stuff that the kids shouldn\u2019t be doing and are my responsibility. \n\nI don\u2019t want my 12 year old babysitting just yet as she is pretty young and doesn\u2019t have experience. Maybe in a couple of years. She helps me with her sister, when she offers, but I\u2019m not ready yet to have her stay home alone with her.\n\nShe and my 10 year old will stay home alone together but I don\u2019t consider that babysitting as my 10 year old can take care of himself.", "He brought the kid into adult matters that's past being civil", "She didn't talk to him in front of her son. She sent him away first.", "Disagree it needed to be said in front of the son because he overstepped and went to the son. The son needed to see his mother shut it down, and hear her reasons why or else he would've went into his room feeling bad that he wasn't man enough or helping his mom out enough. \n\nAnd she didn't go off on the uncle until AFTER the son left, she just told the son his uncle was incorrect and hes just a kid and to go play and then she tore into the uncle, so the son didn't hear anything he didn't need to hear.", "I agree there is a lot the older kids in particular *could* be doing but it\u2019s been three months since their dad died. Chores are not the main focus here. Adjusting to their new life is. A safe home with food where everyone respects each other is a higher priority to me than adding new chores. There will be lots of life to lead without their dad unfortunately and lots of time to clean.\n\nOP - you are NTA. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your husband and your kids\u2019 father. I will cut Martin and in laws some slack because they are also grieving but the attacks by them are out of line.", "If OP's in-laws weren't so intent on forcing little kids to handle adult responsibilities, they'd realize they can help her as the adults in her and those kids' lives.\n\nI really don't understand how a grown ass man can see his brother's widow struggling and, rather than go offer his adult help, turns to a 10 year old child and says \"You're the one who should've prevented this.\"\n\nWhat the hell kind of logic is that?", "Especially *3 MONTHS* after your spouse died.

Take care of yourself as much as you take care of your children. \nMy dad became basically bedridden when I was about the same age as your eldest, so I became a mini adult at 12.  I don't think back to the work load I had that negatively - it gave me a lot of very useful skills that many people in their 30s still don't have. However, I do remember my mother being extremely stressed trying to uphold some silly housewife standards and taking that stress out on me. Look after your own mental health, it's very easy to forget about it in times of grief and to just focus on the practical things we can control.", "Forgive each other is definitely A+ advice, and I hope everyone is willing.", "Actually, this is often time when alienation DOES happen.

You posted your edit either after I posted my comment, or while I was already writing it.

You're \u00e0 single mother now. You're going to have to let go of some things like having a perfectly cleaned house all the time. \n\nIf you can afford it, you can try a cleaning service. If not, then, you do your best. \n\nYou're going to figure how to balance everything. You just need some time.", "Hmmm... that's interesting. Because as I read it, the responses to her are quite negative. You're saying they're always this negative to her? Or could it actually be that what I'm saying makes sense, due to trauma exacerbating matters?", "\"I told her off and that made it worse\" being a pretty blatant piece of evidence, in the very the words of the OP.", "Agreed. \n\nBut your BIL is dealing with grief the way he knows how, as you are dealing with your grief in the way it comes to you. Your two ways clash, which isn\u2019t uncommon in the least. \n\nI dealt with a double tragedy last year. My aunt and cousin were electrocuted after a downed power line was turned back on. Our family (I work for them at our family owned jewelry store) received the call, and our worlds shattered. We were asked to go to the scene of the accident, as they were waiting for my uncle to come home from work.\n\nI witnessed as he was told his wife and only child were dead. I watched him fall apart, and tried desperately to get to their bodies. He moved into my parents home for a while, as the only family he had on his side were his next door neighbors. While he clung to family during this time, he was barely able to function with daily tasks. His mind was nowhere, and everywhere at once. It was like he was stuck in his own skin, and just wanted to run away from himself. It was difficult to watch and try to provide comfort while we were all also grieving this loss. Helping him felt like we were all forced to put our own grief and emotions to the side. Eventually, it created tension. Everyone became frustrated with him, and felt forced into the background of their own struggles. Our family was heartbroken, yet our grief seemed to take second place to what he was going through. \n\nEventually, he more or less pushed us all away, and I hate it. I miss him. I don\u2019t know if it hurt too much to be surrounded by women in our family who looked and acted so much like the wife he lost, or if he grew tired of everyone trying micro-manage him (he struggled quite a bit to do all the end of life tasks, and most were left to us to do. \n\nThe one year anniversary of their death is fifteen days away, and the pain still very much feels fresh. I want my aunt and cousin back, but I can\u2019t have them. I want my uncle back, and I feel like he\u2019s moved on from everything having to do with us. \n\nHow your BIL handled things was wrong, but everyone is just trying to find their way in this. I\u2019d recommend just talking to him. Express that your son is doing exactly what a child his age is meant to do, and everything falling in disarray is just what happens when grief has its clutches in you. You\u2019re learning how to function as a widow and single parent, and doing your best to navigate through that. You need their emotional and sometimes physical support. You need them to be a link to your deceased husband. What you don\u2019t need is to have what little you feel is within your control being taken away from you. It\u2019s still your home and your family, and while you appreciate their help, you are the head of the household, and if they have any concerns, either find other ways to help, or talk to you about them. The children are dealing with enough as it is, and shouldn\u2019t be expected to take on whatever you can\u2019t.", "I am going to look into it. I\u2019ve just had a ton going on.", "ditto.\n\nor for things where what you need is to be 2 (or 3) places at once for pick ups and drop offs, I imagine the older kids' friends' parents will be happy to handle that sort of thing.", "I think its telling you assume she's the main issue tbh", "I think it's pretty weird to assume that because she told the wife who was in the home at the same time that she must there be trying to alienate everyone", "The only semi reasonable thing your BIL seems to have said was the comment about how you might be overly complaining about day to day things to your SIL. You have a right to be upset and needing time to get oriented to this new way of life while also still grieving. It's really hard and a shitty place to be in. \n\nBut I do think your contention about your SIL is unfair. If you're leaning on her a lot (and a good sil will be supportive don't get me wrong you're family and family on good terms should be there for one another ) she may also feel a level of obligation to help out in ways that are getting too much for her and their family. Your bill was wrong and handled it terribly. But saying that well she offered I didn't ask if you're also venting and discussing how hard things are with her a lot is a bit unfair because you could be seen as pressuring her or fishing for more help. I don't know how much she's given and if it's just some inconvenience then that's totally fair to expect and want out of her and to accept that as her only offering what is actually viable and doable for her. But it sounds like it has gone well beyond that and she's dealing worth negative impacts from everything she's doing for you. And if everyone's actually there for you now in a way your  MIL wasn't when she stayed and expected you to cater to her while she played with baby - letting folks know you appreciate them and the help is always a good thing. To be clear you don't come off as a person that needs to be reminded of this but grief and stress can make us forget that sometimes I know I'm guilty of it so if you feel you might be, then something to think about. Fully possible you have been completely and appropriately thankful and expressed appreciation when due - I can't tell from this post either way but I give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo you're NTA but maybe be more cognizant of how much you might be dumping on your sil. Your BIL's conduct was still not at all acceptable and totally warranted a serious response. I do think you maybe reacted stronger than you should have in the exact moment but it's also a product of the background and context of how your husband and his brother grew up and it wasn't really all that bad sounding as far as overreactions go anyway.", "I never ONCE said she was the main issue. Heck, I've taken lengths to explain her situation by alluding to my own. Figure out your reading comprehension a bit better before trying to debate me.", "Your 2nd sentence was about the alienation and you also called her the a****** but OK"]}
