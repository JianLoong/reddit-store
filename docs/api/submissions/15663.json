His dad died when he was young. His older brother, Martin, was definitely parentified and became the \u201cman of the house.\u201d\n\nTogether, Dan and I have 3 children: Sydney (12F), Gabe (10M) and Charlotte (3F). Unfortunately, Dan passed away 3 months ago. It\u2019s been a terrible struggle trying to balance my grief, my children\u2019s on top of the rest of the responsibilities. I have a great support system, so I have been cognizant to make sure my babies still have a childhood. I always said I wouldn\u2019t do what my MIL did.\n\nRecently, I was having a bit of a tough time. Charlotte was sick, Sydney is in about a million activities and the housework was piling up. Martin\u2019s wife, Rachel, offered to come by and help me out. She generously cleaned the house and looked after Charlotte while I ran Sydney to her activities. When I arrived back home, I found Martin and Gabe in the kitchen. Martin was telling him that it shouldn\u2019t have gotten to this stressful point and he should be helping me more. He told him that he was the man of the house and it was up to him to step up.\n\nI cut in and told Gabe to not listen to his uncle, that he is a little boy and it is NOT his job to take over for his father. Rather, it\u2019s his job to play, go to school and just be a kid. I sent him to play. I tore into Martin. I asked him how dare he say that to my son?! I said he may have been parentified but he will NOT do the same to my son. I said if he pulled crap like that again, he\u2019d never see my kids again. Martin told me I was being ungrateful, he was only trying to help. He said more than anything, he was defending his wife as it\u2019s not her job to help me. I reminded him I never asked Rachel for help, she offered. Martin said she wouldn\u2019t have if I wasn\u2019t complaining about how hard my life is.\n\nSince, Dan\u2019s family has been telling me what a bitch I am. They say this is all Martin knows and I was way too harsh on him, especially threatening to cut him off. They told me I need to get my shit together. My MIL especially thinks I need to suck it up and expect my kids (not just Gabe, but Sydney too) to help me with Charlotte. I told her off and that only made it worse.\n\nEveryone is accusing me of alienating Dan\u2019s family, which I\u2019m not trying to do. AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify: My children do have chores and help around the house. The work in question was things that are out of their age bracket and were my responsibility. Thus why I was falling behind considering I also have to take care of the kids, drive them places and do more things that are not age appropriate or their job.", "created_utc": 1682446169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yr59c/aita_for_snapping_at_my_bil_and_threatening_to/", "score": 6957, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did the wrong thing for the right reason. You handled the situation poorly and escalated it needlessly\u2026.but I think it\u2019s understandable given your loss.

Unfortunately, your BIL has a different view of a male child\u2019s responsibility in a situation like this because of how he was raised. I imagine that he\u2019s proud that he was able to \u201cstep up\u201d and help his mom after his dad died. He\u2019s not alone in this way of thinking. Before I get attacked, I want to make clear that I 100% agree with you that children should get to be children (at least whenever possible).

Your kids are grieving, your BIL is grieving, all the family your husband has is grieving. I get that it hurts, but your BIL is working through this the only way he knows how, and you pushing people away is cutting life lines you are in desperate need of, as well as a strong connection your children have to their father (the man who can tell them all the stories for what your husband was like at their age).\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve got it wrong, but it sounds like you and BIL\u2019s reaction to loss is just different. I don\u2019t think he meant any harm of it, and it seems like you reacted too strongly to his comments toward your son when he truly is just trying to encourage your child to step in and help when he can with things a child his age is fully capable of doing. \n\nAgain, most children (at least when I was that age) do have chores suitable to their age.", "Soft YTA. Not for  not wanting your son to have that \"man of the house\" mindset instilled in him, but for biting off Martin's head when he didn't realize he was doing something wrong.\n\nThat said, three months is practically no time at all when it comes to grief of this magnitude. You'd think and hope your in-laws would be understanding of that. But then, they're grieving, too. They lost a son and a brother and probably aren't at their best, either.\n\nI suggest meeting up in whatever combination you feel most comfortable - all together or one on one - and apologize for the way you treated Martin but explain that you don't want your son to feel like it's his job to take on a household leadership role at this age. You want him to still be able to live his life as a kid with age-appropriate responsibilities, not have extra foisted upon him just because he's the one in the house with a penis. (Maybe don't word it exactly like that, because straight up accusing them of being sexist isn't the best idea if you want to have a relationship. Attitudes like that don't generally come from a  conscious \"women are inferior!\" belief but rather just...being how they were brought up.)\n\nAnd thank them for their help, but impress upon them that your household rules are the rules, and if they can't respect that, then your interactions going forward might be limited. Though, if you are struggling a whole lot with basic household tasks, it might be worth taking a look at all of the kids' responsibilities (and *maybe* activities) and seeing if any adjustments need made. As much as I'm sure you want life to be able to continue on just like normal for everyone...it's not normal.

He said he didn't know how to be the man of the house and that he never wanted to be an adult. I told him again that it never was his job.

All the parenting rights belong solely to you now.  \n\nLastly, it\u2019s beyond ridiculous that any of them have the nerve to tell you - 3 months after losing your husband - that you need to get your shit together.  Anyone who loses a spouse that has 3 small children to finish raising is entitled to at least a small measure of grace.  \n\nAnd your MIL arguing that you should ease your stress over taking on the other half of the parenting responsibilities by shoving those responsibilities off onto your children is as horrible as it sounds.

Emotions are going wonky while everyone tries to come up with some kind of survival strategy. \n\nPretending to be \"just fine\" isn't going to get you where you and your kids need to be. \" Be the man\" is just stupid, but it's probably all that poor man knows. Recognize that all of it is coming from love. It's just that they don't teach surviving grief in school. People just make it up as they go along and spend so much time bumbling around in the fog.\n\nI don't know if you and the kids are undergoing grief therapy, but you need it. If there is a support group in your area, run don't walk. It can get you through those \"too much pain to breathe\" 2 a.m.'s. Take care and know that the light does come back on.

He just lost his brother and you threatened to remove his only tie. \n\nYou made a statement about his upbringing being wrong and  insulted his mom. So he got mad. \n\nYour MIL is doing the same thing to you that you did to her son. You were protecting your son from bad advice when you yelled and threatened your BIL.  MIL is protecting her son from a threat sadly in her eyes that's you. \n\nPut yourself in her place and someone was threatening to do something that would cause your child pain.

HOWEVER, you yourself know that Martin was fully indoctrinated with that belief and obviously he has never gotten over it.  Martin is also grieving the loss of his brother, and he ALSO deserves a pass, for blurting out the Family Line.  \n\n\nHad you ever talked to Martin about this Family Line before?  What I mean is, had you or Dan ever talked with him about your feelings that this \"parentizing of children\" was not a good thing?

You really went off on him for telling his nephew to help his grieving, struggling mom more. You could have sat him down and said while you understand that\u2019s how he grew up, you still want your son to have a childhood & that you\u2019re gonna make sure he does. It\u2019s your house and your children after all, what anyone suggests doesn\u2019t necessarily have to happen or change the way you live but you also can\u2019t police every interaction your kids have with their other family members.

You are coming from the standpoint that parentification is so bad that if your BIL ever brings it up again you will cut contact. Which basically means that you believe that your MIL did something that your consider to be horrible and that your BIL is not a hero but a victim. I am sure for them it\u2019s a tough pill to swallow, especially when they are dealing with a death of the loved one. \nI would recommend having a heart to heart conversation with them and saying that you are not judging anyone and you are sure they did the best they could in their situation, but the times are different now and you want your kids to be kids\n\nI hope everything works out for you! \n\nNAH", "YTA, but it was very justified to counteract some misogynistic bullcrap from BIL.

You know this was coming from a place of love, and He knows you are getting worn down. If your eldest son is old enough to help, he should be helping IMO.

My dad had me cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming, washing windows, mowing the lawn, ect since I was Gabes age. Nothing wrong with having the kids do some chores.", "This is my answer too. Everyone lost someone here. It's awful all around. For the kids sake, I hope you make peace and don't turn this into them losing what's left of their dad and his family. I have a friend who's nephew died in a horrible accident. Her sister, mom of nephew, has torpedoed the entire family and ruined any relationship left with her other children and the rest of the family because she's so full of anger.  It's understandable to be angry and grief is different for everyone.  But you just can't ruin the entire family dynamic because you are hurting.  It won't bring the lost loved one back, and you will lose so much more in the end.   Everything about it is heartbreaking. But grace and understanding are important for everyone involved.", "Finally. Soft YTA for OP. I understand where she is coming from but threatening to cut her family in law from her kids was way extreme (from what she posted of course). The kids will need their extended family and contrary to Reddit believes people can disagree and keep in contact. I understand that she is the deep of the grief herself - but so is her husband\u2019s family. It\u2019s not the time for this. And she will also need their support. A good open heart conversation should be the way to go.

I wanted to tell you directly that you are amazing for breaking this generational trauma and not parentifying your son. You are clearly going through a lot, but you are still your childrens' defender. I wish my mom would have defended me, like you have here, just once. \n\nYou can do this.

She did not need to chew him out and threaten him with abandonment.", "Right?  And consider that the root issue here is apparently that he was expected to act as a parent when they were kids - that's a really weird bond, because it's not just his brother, but the child he helped raise.\n\nThe AH here is the entire situation the whole family has been plunged into. The whole family is in pain, and each of them is trying to figure out how they deal with it. Grief is difficult, and it's personal. Not all of them are going to deal with it well.  Not all of them are going to deal with it in ways the others appreciate.  But some awareness that the shit situation is the common enemy, will go a whole long way.\n\nI'm not faulting OP. And I do genuinely believe it's right for her to say that's not the way she wants to raise her children.  But just as I'm not going to blame a wife who's just lost their husband, I'm not going to blame a mother who's just lost their son, or a man who's just lost their brother.

To me \"stepping up\" at that age would mean do your homework without being asked, put your clothes in the hamper, put your dishes in the dishwasher.

It sounds like BIL had good intentions, and OP could have had a conversation with her son after to reassure him that he's not expected to go work in the coal mines. \n\nI hope the whole family is able to give each other some grace, they're all grieving.

If their response is to double down and whine that she's alienating the kids, then these are people who are never, ever going to understand the irony of their words.

And I disagree, I do think he is at some level jealous, or envious if that's a better adjective. It's really, really hard to see someone else literally living the childhood you wanted and deserved and should have had. I lost my parents when I was very young, and for a long time, it was difficult for me to listen to or care about my friends issues with their parents because I was so mad that they had these parents they weren't appreciating, and I didn't have anybody. It took a lot of self work and therapy to realize that's a messed up mentality, and fix it. I'm not faulting him for going through that, it's so difficult even if the loss happens when you're an adult.

The SIL showed up with practical assistance and respect. And OP did say why she thought the MIL was wrong... Because \"parentification\". Sounds like you may have experienced it yourself. Look up the term and see what's said about how it affects development. Im sorry you experienced the loss of a parent, and without a support system.
