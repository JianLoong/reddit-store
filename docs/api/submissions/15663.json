His dad died when he was young. His older brother, Martin, was definitely parentified and became the \u201cman of the house.\u201d\n\nTogether, Dan and I have 3 children: Sydney (12F), Gabe (10M) and Charlotte (3F). Unfortunately, Dan passed away 3 months ago. It\u2019s been a terrible struggle trying to balance my grief, my children\u2019s on top of the rest of the responsibilities. I have a great support system, so I have been cognizant to make sure my babies still have a childhood. I always said I wouldn\u2019t do what my MIL did.\n\nRecently, I was having a bit of a tough time. Charlotte was sick, Sydney is in about a million activities and the housework was piling up. Martin\u2019s wife, Rachel, offered to come by and help me out. She generously cleaned the house and looked after Charlotte while I ran Sydney to her activities. When I arrived back home, I found Martin and Gabe in the kitchen. Martin was telling him that it shouldn\u2019t have gotten to this stressful point and he should be helping me more. He told him that he was the man of the house and it was up to him to step up.\n\nI cut in and told Gabe to not listen to his uncle, that he is a little boy and it is NOT his job to take over for his father. Rather, it\u2019s his job to play, go to school and just be a kid. I sent him to play. I tore into Martin. I asked him how dare he say that to my son?! I said he may have been parentified but he will NOT do the same to my son. I said if he pulled crap like that again, he\u2019d never see my kids again. Martin told me I was being ungrateful, he was only trying to help. He said more than anything, he was defending his wife as it\u2019s not her job to help me. I reminded him I never asked Rachel for help, she offered. Martin said she wouldn\u2019t have if I wasn\u2019t complaining about how hard my life is.\n\nSince, Dan\u2019s family has been telling me what a bitch I am. They say this is all Martin knows and I was way too harsh on him, especially threatening to cut him off. They told me I need to get my shit together. My MIL especially thinks I need to suck it up and expect my kids (not just Gabe, but Sydney too) to help me with Charlotte. I told her off and that only made it worse.\n\nEveryone is accusing me of alienating Dan\u2019s family, which I\u2019m not trying to do. AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify: My children do have chores and help around the house. The work in question was things that are out of their age bracket and were my responsibility. Thus why I was falling behind considering I also have to take care of the kids, drive them places and do more things that are not age appropriate or their job.", "created_utc": 1682446169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yr59c/aita_for_snapping_at_my_bil_and_threatening_to/", "score": 1508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did the wrong thing for the right reason. You handled the situation poorly and escalated it needlessly\u2026.but I think it\u2019s understandable given your loss.

Unfortunately, your BIL has a different view of a male child\u2019s responsibility in a situation like this because of how he was raised. I imagine that he\u2019s proud that he was able to \u201cstep up\u201d and help his mom after his dad died. He\u2019s not alone in this way of thinking. Before I get attacked, I want to make clear that I 100% agree with you that children should get to be children (at least whenever possible).

You'd think and hope your in-laws would be understanding of that. But then, they're grieving, too. They lost a son and a brother and probably aren't at their best, either.\n\nI suggest meeting up in whatever combination you feel most comfortable - all together or one on one - and apologize for the way you treated Martin but explain that you don't want your son to feel like it's his job to take on a household leadership role at this age. You want him to still be able to live his life as a kid with age-appropriate responsibilities, not have extra foisted upon him just because he's the one in the house with a penis. (Maybe don't word it exactly like that, because straight up accusing them of being sexist isn't the best idea if you want to have a relationship. Attitudes like that don't generally come from a  conscious \"women are inferior!\" belief but rather just...being how they were brought up.)\n\nAnd thank them for their help, but impress upon them that your household rules are the rules, and if they can't respect that, then your interactions going forward might be limited.

As much as I'm sure you want life to be able to continue on just like normal for everyone...it's not normal.

Our family (I work for them at our family owned jewelry store) received the call, and our worlds shattered. We were asked to go to the scene of the accident, as they were waiting for my uncle to come home from work.\n\nI witnessed as he was told his wife and only child were dead. I watched him fall apart, and tried desperately to get to their bodies. He moved into my parents home for a while, as the only family he had on his side were his next door neighbors. While he clung to family during this time, he was barely able to function with daily tasks. His mind was nowhere, and everywhere at once. It was like he was stuck in his own skin, and just wanted to run away from himself. It was difficult to watch and try to provide comfort while we were all also grieving this loss. Helping him felt like we were all forced to put our own grief and emotions to the side. Eventually, it created tension. Everyone became frustrated with him, and felt forced into the background of their own struggles. Our family was heartbroken, yet our grief seemed to take second place to what he was going through. \n\nEventually, he more or less pushed us all away, and I hate it. I miss him. I don\u2019t know if it hurt too much to be surrounded by women in our family who looked and acted so much like the wife he lost, or if he grew tired of everyone trying micro-manage him (he struggled quite a bit to do all the end of life tasks, and most were left to us to do. \n\nThe one year anniversary of their death is fifteen days away, and the pain still very much feels fresh. I want my aunt and cousin back, but I can\u2019t have them.

You\u2019re learning how to function as a widow and single parent, and doing your best to navigate through that. You need their emotional and sometimes physical support. You need them to be a link to your deceased husband. What you don\u2019t need is to have what little you feel is within your control being taken away from you. It\u2019s still your home and your family, and while you appreciate their help, you are the head of the household, and if they have any concerns, either find other ways to help, or talk to you about them.

You should keep that in mind.\n\nLosing a brother he helped raise probably hurts a lot as well, and he's having to process his own grief.

You also never said why you think your MIL was wrong to allow him to take that role... I don't think it's fair to treat him like a victim trying to inflict the same trauma on your children he endured. Does he have an uncle? Perhaps he received that same talk and he appreciates it now as an adult. He may very well have good intentions in passing that wisdom to your son - you never know.\n\nLastly, If you can't tell I was that boy in my childhood - except it was mom who died.

I'm not saying telling them how sad you are or how hard everything is. Or about money and stuff. Kid appropiate things.

He said he didn't know how to be the man of the house and that he never wanted to be an adult. I told him again that it never was his job.

Was there an option for a calmer discussion about this with your BIL where he wouldn't have felt the need to jump to the defensive?  Being parentified himself he probably does not see what was wrong with what he said to your son because it was exactly what happened to him.

I think it was, but you are welcome to disagree. What I was arguing about was your judgement, because Y-T-A implies that *only* OP was the AH and there is no way that is true in this situation. I wouldn't have bothered replying to you if it had been E-S-H, because what's considered an overreaction is subjective. But this guy was definitely an AH in this situation, no matter what his intentions were.", "Which is awful....how can a 10 year old babysit ....", "No a 16yo should be focused on school and friends, possibly a part time job.  They can help, they can clean their stuff up but it still not their job to help run a house.  Its still not their responsibility to do dad's share of the chores or be mum's emotional support person.", "My DH died when my son was 16 and daughter was 20.   I told my dad to never say man up or your the man of the house to him.  That's not his responsibility and role in my household.", "Scorched earth is a great response.  My late wife had two living parents and 4 siblings.  Only one respected my position as the father of my girls, she's allowed to see them whenever she wants to, a real sweetie....  The rest can go suck it.", "Yeah, I doubt he was pitching in to help. He was too busy trying to guilt-trip a 10 year old who lost his father \ud83d\ude44.", "Idk I think laying in to a kid telling them they aren't doing enough and telling them to man up after their dad died is a pretty good reason to cut a family member off.", "Point taken. You\u2019re right. I forgot  that a Y T A vote means the other person was not the AH. I\u2019ll update.", "People need to stop telling people when their children are old enough to babysit in this sub. I started at 12. That doesn't mean I expect every 12-year-old to babysit or know how to or be comfortable or the parent to be comfortable...\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with not wanting your pre-teen to babysit.", "I did when I was 10 - only ever for an hour or two, never at dinner time, and I had emergency numbers if I needed them. When I was 13 then it increased and included meals", "Absolutely!", "So true. Been a single mom of three, 10, 7, and 4 years old, for 17 months now. I learned to rearrange my priorities and sometimes good enough, just has to be good enough. I learned to cuddle with them on the couch and enjoy some Domino's pizza in our downtime together and not be stressed out about not having a home cooked meal or the toy room being a complete disaster or dishes being in the sink. \ud83e\udd37", "Also, you need to reduce your children's activities for a while.  I know they need their friends -- but you all need unstructured time together to grieve.  I have 6 kids and it's usually one activity per kid.  I would stick to one per kid for now -- then no more than two after that.", "He spoke to him.  Was he screaming?  Don\u2019t think so.  Single moms don\u2019t have endless support systems and sometimes people do stuff you just need to forgive them for.  If we cut off everyone who ever makes a mistake we\u2019re going to be pretty isolated.", "It\u2019s also possible he was just telling him that so the boy helps out more or keeps his mom/sisters in mind as he makes decisions in his life. Yes 10 is young for this really, but is 12? 14? \n\nThis is a very cliche thing for guys to say to boys who lost their father", "Just because you did doesn't make it the right thing or the responsible one to let a 10 year old looking over another child. I mean, a 10 year old shouldn't even be left alone. Imagine with a smaller child.", "Housework is a marathon not a sprint. Learn to pace yourself. Your house is for living in, not an IKEA showroom. I say this as a mother to a severely disabled child with a husband who spent most of our marriage away with the army.", "Completely normal to want a deep clean when you are going through stuff.  Hell, I broke my arm, and suddenly all I could see was all the dirt I couldn't do anything about.  For the only time in my life, I hired cleaners. They did a great job, I was so grateful... and uncomfortable. \n\nEnjoy the clean house. If possible budget for a professional deep clean a couple of times a year. And turn your back on anyone who would tell your 10 year old, grieving, son that he needs to fill his father's shoes. That is simply messed up.", "I am so sorry for your loss!\n\nAre you in the US and if so have you applied for you social security benefits? Each of your children is entitled to survivors benefits, you are as well if your income is low. You can use that money to pay someone to clean for you!", "Someone doesn't have to be screaming to say something cruel or insensitive. And this is a pretty big fucking mistake to make, esp in someone else's house to someone else's kid you have no business parenting. And I frankly find it disgusting to suggest that a single mother should take subpar support.", "It being a calm serious conversation is incredibly dangerous because that is more likely to get through to most kids than screaming at them is, or to get through to them in a very different way, at least. Tone of voice does not absolve this in the least and expecting OP to react perfectly calmly and maturely to such dangerous talk considering what she's going through is ridiculous.", "Legally 10 year olds can be left alone - just cuz you over baby your child doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the world does\u2026", "Yep, when I struggle with it I set my phone timer for ten minutes and get as much done as I can. It makes a really big difference surprisingly.", "Her husband died 3 months ago. You are telling a recent widow that she shouldn\u2019t get support. You are making bold assumptions about her overly complaining. Has it occurred to you that SIL was looking to help her because she wants to support her?  When people are going through difficult times the people who love them  look for ways to support them. Stop shaming people for accepting support from people who want to help them.", "Not all 10 year olds are the same, obviously. Just because it's \"legal,\" doesn't mean it's safe. The maturity level in preteens and teens is wildly varying. I was a 10 year old who could be left alone. My brother? Absolutely not, probably wasn't a good idea until he was 13 at least. It depends on the child and I would say, in general, 10 year olds that are mature enough to be left home alone are the exception, not the rule, so accusing someone of \"babying\" their child for not leaving them home alone is truly absurd.", "Consider that not all children are developmentally in the same place at age 10. It\u2019s great that you were able to do so at your age, but no one knows her kids better than her. I\u2019m guessing she would allow babysitting if she felt it was the right time for her kids to do so. Cookie-cutter solutions are really not a great way to parent\u2026", "If you actually read any of what I said I actually specifically said that she should be able to lean on her family for support and that I don't know if there's any validity to the criticism she may be overly leaning on her sil. I actually repeatedly said she doesn't seem like that's the case and I never once shamed her. I was suggesting that this might be where BIL is coming from and that that's where his issue is actually stemming from. I suggested based on my own experience that it is something I've also not thought about understandably so but nowhere did I shame her or anything like that. I didn't even criticize or critique her .\n\nI'm deleting the other comment because three separate ah's messaged me basically quoting from your incorrect distillation and comment about what I said and made abusive comments but suggesting that supporting someone through something difficult is also something that takes a toll is accurate and expecting those people to not have human emotions or lives that can be impacted is unfair and unrealistic", "I read everything you had to say. You used flowerly language to say that OP, who lost her husband 3 months ago, was likely overly complaining to SIL and that SIL felt no choice but to help because of OP complaining too much to SIL. You indeed were shaming her despite your flowery language you used to hide your judgement."]}
