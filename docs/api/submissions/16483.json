They are incredibly close & I love that he has that relationship. They have shared life\u2019s ups & downs for 24 years. \n\nThe best friend\u2019s wife (F51) has never said one nice word to me in the six years I\u2019ve known her. (I met her when I started dating my now husband.) \n\nShe actively is rude to me & says hurtful things, like calling our then engagement \u201cstupid.\u201d Most of the time she doesn\u2019t speak to me. In my own house that woman can spend an evening and not utter one word to me, even when I speak directly to her. \n\nWe live in a very social neighborhood and I\u2019m frequently planning parties, get-togethers, etc. It is normally all couples. \n\nLast week some of the guys went on a golf trip & I was planning on hosting their wives at my home. I wasn\u2019t going to invite her because I work hard all week and don\u2019t want to spend my free time with mean people. \n\nMy husband asked me to please invite her to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d and I said no. He implored me that it would hurt his best friend\u2019s feelings if his wife was excluded. But what about MY feelings, was my response. It turned in to a huge disagreement. \n\nIn the end, I didn\u2019t host anyone & went to the movies by myself. \n\nI think there are two AH in this story (my husband and his best friend\u2019s wife) but I\u2019m not one of them. \n\nShould I just get over it? Or should my husband have my back?\n\nMore context:\n\nWhen she called my engagement ring \u201cstupid\u201d my husband called her out and made her apologize. \n\nI feel she sees me as an interloper as she was there for my husband during his terrible first marriage and then during his many single years. She routinely stocked his fridge with homemade food & helped with household projects that needed a woman\u2019s touch. When I came on the scene, her help wasn\u2019t needed anymore as I\u2019m a good cook & decorator. \nI can see where she feels \u201creplaced\u201d but I swear I was nice to her about it.", "created_utc": 1683318911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1390jmm/aitah_for_not_inviting_my_husbands_best_friends/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It really sounds like she has feelings for your husband and doesn't like you because of it. I'm sorry to say that and maybe it's not the case. But I don't think you are the AH here because why should you keep making an effort for someone who doesn't make an effort for you?", "NTA. There is no reason you need to invite people who are hostile to you into YOUR home. And \"keep the peace\" is never a good enough reason to let people violate your boundaries. If your husband wants to fix this, he and his best friend need to talk to that woman.", "NTA - Sounds like her feelings for your husband may be in emotional affair territory.\n\nRun what that means past your husband and see if he recognizes any of that in her behavior.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely reasonable to not want to be the host for someone who\u2019s spent all their time knowing just being rude to you", "NTA\n\nWhat you do with your free time is your own business. You get to invite whoever you want, and if you don't want to spend time with this woman, then don't.\n\nMoreover, if your husband leaves on a trip, that's just an added bonus, he's not even there. I kind if get it when it's a couples event, but this isn't.\n\nI do believe you need to clearly share what's going on with your husband. It may also help to get some alone time with that woman if you want to, but you don't owe it to anyone. That would be just kudos to you and being a much better person. But, again, you would not owe that to anyone.", "You called the situation correctly, welcome to AITA.\n\nYou - NTA\n\nHusband - Asshole for not sticking up to you.  He can have a frank chat with his so called best friend.\n\nBest Friends Wife - Asshole for treating you like this when it sounds like it isn't deserved.\n\nIt sucks when you have a nice neighbor but can't get along with the spouse.  I had someone move in beside me once and I saw the husband outside so I went over to introduce myself.  He was nice and we chatted for like 15+ minutes.  As I left to go back inside I noticed his wife was sitting in the car (less then 10 feet from us!) in the driveway the whole time with a scowl on her face.  She never said 1 word to me over the few years we lived beside each other which made it tough to have a relationship with the husband.  At least she wasn't mean to me though.", "NTA, the best friend's wife is the AH.  Your husband too, but he's just trying to maintain his friendship.  Good on you for standing up for yourself.  Next time invite all the wives but her - she'll get the message loud and clear.\n\nWhat you say about her perceiving you as an interloper is probably what's going on.  I wonder if her marriage is rocky and she was having an emotional affair with your now-husband.  Six years is a long time to carry that kind of grudge.  Sucks to be her.", "NTA\nI'm in agreement that she's, potentially,  harbouring some feelings for your husband.", "NTA. You get ONE husband.", "NTA\n\n You have every right to feel comfortable in your own home. Social rules are not a law but they are typically followed in a similar way. So when someone behaves poorly in a social situation, that's why most people feel the need to stop and or correct them. \nYour husband is definitely in the wrong for not supporting your decision. It was also inappropriate for him to ask you to include someone that can't be bothered to treat you with respect. But the real issue here is the neighbors wife. She clearly stepped into a role that she shouldn't have while married to another man. There is nothing wrong with helping people, especially someone who is struggling. But it seems like she's crossed some emotional boundaries with your now husband. Intentionally or not, this is not okay for anyone and it's only going to lead to future problems. \n Because of the relationship with your husband and his best friend, I would suggest all four of you sitting down and clearing the air. Don't accuse, don't point fingers and talk about YOUR feelings, not someone's actions. \n\nGood luck \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u2764", "NTA.  You don't  have to be best friends  but if you don't  have the decency to speak to me when you enter my home than you will not be entering my home. I would ask your husband why keeping the peace with his best friend is more important than making sure someone doesn't  disrespect you in your home. Yes not speaking to someone at all when you are in their home is disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nWho wants to hangout with a mean bully all night in their own house. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to. Your husband should also be siding with you because you have legitimate reasons not to invite her.", "NTA.  Yes your husband should have your back, the fact that he does not makes me wonder whether or not he may have had some latent feelings for her. It is clear that she has more than friendly feelings for him, otherwise she would have been cheering him on when he found a new love interest.", "NTA\n\nYour husband doesn't want to rock the boat. I get it. Setting boundaries is uncomfortable and scary. Unfortunately, he is effectively choosing to sacrifice your peace because he doesn't want to have 1-2 uncomfortable interactions in the future. Not cool.", "Of course NTA.\nAlso, I would like to know from your HB why in the world his friend should feel bad if you don't include a woman who mistreats you. Shouldn't he rather feel bad for his wife's attitude? Besides, why it is said to you to keep the peace but not to her when they come to your home?", "NTA.\n\nShe clearly doesn't want to be around you, so why on earth would you invite her if her husband wasn't coming, too? You're just putting up with her for his sake. Your socializing time is for who *you* want to socialize with, not who your husband wants you to socialize with.", "NTA. For me, its fine that he asked. Its also fine that you said \"no\". \n\nIf your husband want to \"keep the peace\" he should arrange more couple dates where you're likely to have good times. If that's impossible...then why would she want to come over without the husbands anyhow?", "NTA\n\nYour husband cares more about her feelings than yours.\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation about this with him.", "NTA \n\nTell your husband \u201cOur home is my safe space and I don\u2019t have to allow ANYONE entry who doesn\u2019t make me feel safe.\u201d \n\nBtw, she has feelings for your husband.", "NTA. \n\nIf you're inviting people over for a social event when your husband's out of town, it's not a couple's event and you should be able to invite whomever you want without needing your husband's approval of the invite list. And, yes, your husband should have *your* back in this situation, not his best friend's or his best friend's wife. \n\nNow, *that said*, if this was 6 buddies going on a trip together and you're inviting over 5 of their wives but *not* the crabby one ... that *is* pretty damn passive-aggressive. If Crabby Wife has a habit of being rude and dismissive toward you, I don't think it rises to YTA level. But it's not a good look. It would almost certainly generate talk among the husbands *and* the wives about *you* ... and it *wouldn't* be positive talk. \n\nA more mature way to deal with this situation is to invite Crabby Wife over for coffee, pour each of you a cuppa joe, sit her down, look her in the eyes, and say something along the lines of: \n\n\"Is there a problem? Because I get a very strong sense that you have a problem with me because of Examples A, B, and C. Our husbands have a long, great friendship, and I don't want the relationship or lack thereof between you and me, Crabby Wife, to be a source of friction. But it is becoming a source of friction in *my* marriage because I don't want to be around someone who treats me like you've been treating me or invite them into my home.
