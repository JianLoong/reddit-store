This doesn\u2019t read like it was written by a teacher much less an Adult. \n\nSecond, I\u2019ve never heard of teachers starting their own clubs at the schools they teach at. Did you get permission from the school admins?\n\nThird, teachers don\u2019t just get to consistently leave early like that if that aren\u2019t teaching. They still have to be in their classroom in case they are needed", "ESH you are grownups.  Figure it out together or talk to the bosses like normal workers or they will start hiding the nets or setting up in fourth period.", "NTA - edited to add judgement based on op's answer\n\nINFO: are the courts needed for student activities or practice after school?", "NAH - yet. Quick questions: \n\n\nAre the nets and stuff that you\u2019re using the PE depts\u2019 equipment or personal stuff? I would take very poorly to someone walking in my classroom and using my musical gear, for example. \n\nInsofar as them not knowing where the gear is, I\u2019m unsure as to whether they\u2019re fobbing you off with an excuse or they\u2019re genuinely unorganised. If it\u2019s the latter they don\u2019t really have to help you find it I suppose - but this sounds slightly more like them being a bit pissed that you\u2019re using \u201ctheir stuff\u201d without their permission. \n\nPublic or private? I\u2019m guessing private, lol.", "WNBTA, but wouldn't it be better to use your words?  I feel like all of you educated adults could come to an agreement about the use of the courts.", "You take the same key piece off of each net, so they can\u2019t play at and hide one or two in the PE (or any) teacher\u2019s personal cabinet or classroom and then when they throw a fit get them fired.

It\u2019s not leaving early, it\u2019s leaving\u2026 after work finishes, which is normal and acceptable in basically all workplaces. \n\nInsofar as clubs why would they have to ask admins? Do you teach? I\u2019m really curious as to what kind of workplace environment you\u2019ve been in that you feel it would be necessary to ask permission to hang out with colleagues (assuming it\u2019s not a club that somehow contravenes work guidelines, like a \u201cmen only\u201d or whatever scenario).", "Wrote this out of anger and frustration. Wasn\u2019t writing a philosophy.\n\nAre you a teacher? Teachers can do what they want after school. Once it is 3:00 we can do whatever we please. We did not sit around our classrooms.", "Teachers absolutely have their own \u2018clubs\u2019 after school. Facilities are there to use, why would the school not let staff use the hall/gym and school equipment?\n\nTeachers don\u2019t have to stay in their classrooms during PPA at all. Half the time their room will be being used by another class so they won\u2019t be able to use their classroom anyway, much less stay in there in case they\u2019re needed.

The net I guess belongs to the PE department. \n\nWe were playing the other day and the PE HOLA walked pass and chatted with us happily and said there\u2019s a speaker in the office if we wanted music, so clearly he didn\u2019t have an issue. He wasn\u2019t present today though.", "Tried that too. Asked them 3 times if they could help us set it or find the parts. They kept saying they weren\u2019t sure and they had no idea", "NTA then.  If they're not needed for class or practice teachers should be able to use the courts", "Talk to him and if there are multiple groups wanting to use the net, you can work out a rotation.
