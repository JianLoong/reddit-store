Sending your ex photos of the kids is a kindness that you have been showing him. Kindness, not an obligation. Just let them know that they will have to take their own photos from now on. You will post the photos that you take and they are welcome to look at those. \n\nBut, until they stop trying to change your daughter's skin tone, don't let them have access to the photos. And if they pull them from the internet, you will always have the originals to show exactly what they are doing. \n\nThe freaking audacity of them to demand you send photos as though it is your job to do so is maddening.", "NTA. They are setting Emma up for issues with her body. Can you talk to her and see what she thinks of those filtered versions (without making a big deal about it, of course)? \n\nYou don't need to share photos with your ex, and if they are making things emotionally difficult for your daughter you should intervene.", "NTA.  I would bet a month's pay that your ex is the reason your daughter is self conscious about her completion.   My daughter has the pretties hazel eyes.  They are a blue, green and gold color.  My ex, her father use to make fun of her eyes because they are different. She is grown now, but she still hates her eyes because of him.", "Nta. The photos you send don't need an added filter and whatever reason they have behind altering the photo is weird. Don't send them any more photos, they can take their own. I would also comment on any altered ones they post about the editing and that would probably stop that real quick. Best of luck.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't good for Emma. Them editing her skin tone will just make Emma feel like her skin tone isn't good enough and that she'll have to have skin tone like Ava's to be pretty. This is sending the wrong message to her and it might cause her to feel insecurity and resentment later on.", "NTA\n\nYour EX can take photos on their own parenting time. Who would even filter kids unless it is something fun like a deer?", "NTA. It sounds like your daughter is sensitive about her looks because her dad makes shitty comments. Unless it's a big event, you don't have to send pics to your ex. He can take his own pictures when he has the kids. All you have to do is make sure both of your kids feel special/beautiful in their own way.", "NTA", "In this, I\u2019m going to deem NTA. You stated that A\u2019s skin isn\u2019t changed at all but Emma\u2019s is, so it\u2019s clearly NOT a filter. As parents who are separated, it\u2019s not your job to pick up slack in taking them out and supplying pictures for the father, when he could find time to take his child out, so your mother is also wrong for stating that. Priorities.. Was it nice of you? Of course, you didn\u2019t have to send them anything while spending time with your children. If the photos are edited, it\u2019s very disgusting that they would try to highlight that Emma has darker skin compared to his daughter, I can\u2019t even fathom what the reason would be but sadly, it does happen. And if it was an actual filter, they could\u2019ve stopped using them once they seen that you were displeased with the outcome.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes some filters will change the color of some things and not others. It isn't that crazy for them to just click the photo enhance button on many photo apps before posting them. If you truly believe that they are doing this to target one daughters skin tone then have proof before making the parent relationship more strained. Ask them what app filter they are using since it really brings out some beautiful colors. Then test the photos yourself to see if it is actually something to target your pale daughter. If this doesn't seem feasible then simply send black and white versions of the photos. There isnt any easy way for them to tamper with colors at that point and it doesn't leave as much room for argument", "NTA - They don\u2019t have a right to YOUR photos.

Protect her OP and die on this hill", "Nta they can take their own photos.", "Slightly off topic, but...\n\nYour daughter is getting bullied. Right now by her father, later by schoolmates, if she isn't already.\n\nUnfortunately being a ginger is something to pick on, like being called 'Abcde' or 'Reighfille' or being a different ethnicity, too tall, overweight, poor, etc. I'm not excusing it, just saying that is life.\n\nWhen she comes to you asking to dye her hair, just do it. It is a very easy way to non-permanently change something that will have a huge impact on the bullying level and ultimately your daughters *self esteem*. It isn't ideal that she needs to change, but schools never enforce no bullying, and apparently neither does her own father.\n\nI know you say *you* find her hair very beautiful, but that is you. You aren't the one living with it. Giving her the chance to change it now, may mean she grows up into a strong, confident woman that may choose to be a ginger, rather than looking at herself as flawed by this one characteristic and lowering her self worth accordingly.", "There is nothing called \"right to photos\" anywhere for any relationship. This is so weird. She shouldn't send pix of either girls IMO- what is tomorrow Ava gains some weight and the \"slim filter\" comes out in her social pix", "I would just not let Emma see anything they post and stop sending them pics. I would NOT ask her what she thinks, she is too young to run across these pics herself anyway. No reason to let her know they even exist. They can post pics they take obviously, but OP does not need to give them any."]}
