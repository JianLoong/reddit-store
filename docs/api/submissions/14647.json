It is a widespread practice that hunters actually do not or cannot follow the animal after they have wounded it, and these animals crawl off to heal or to suffer and die. The man-eater problems of the past were caused by this widespread practice and it is no less prevalent today with deer and other animals. Factory killed animals are not wounded and left to suffer.
