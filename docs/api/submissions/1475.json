At the time this incident took place, I was eighteen, fresh out of high school, and had found a job at a local middle school (helping out students in classrooms and supervising the cafeteria during lunch periods). The faculty room had a kitchenette along with a community refrigerator for storing your lunch. Often my fellow staff members would bring in food to share with others (Tubs of Rita\u2019s Italian ice, a grocery store cake to share, bagels, etc). I thought it was very kind and even once anonymously brought in some homemade cupcakes to share.\n\nOne Friday afternoon after a particularly long workday, I stopped in the faculty room before leaving for the day to collect my lunch bag and water bottle from the fridge. Out of curiosity, I opened the freezer and saw that there was an unmarked open box of Klondike bars. I love Klondike bars and figured that since there was no note, it would be okay for me to take one. The following week, the box was still there, so I took another (there were still quite a few left).\n\nI left for vacation for a week, and upon returning to work, I was walking through the hallway when suddenly a custodian in what I assume are his mid-fifties approaches me and says, \u201cHey, you! Do you like Klondike bars?\u201d Startled at the confrontation, I looked at him warily and said, \u201cYes\u2026I do.\u201d He then asked, \u201cDid you take those Klondike bars in the freezer?\u201d I felt a pang of guilt. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize they were yours. I thought anyone could have them.\u201d In that moment, I was feeling so stupid and ashamed. He said something along the lines of, \u201cSo it was you. I\u2019ve been asking around and some people told me it might have been the new kid. Those aren\u2019t yours. They were mine.\u201d Embarrassed, I apologized profusely and offered to purchase him a new box. He grumbled a thank you and walked away. I felt so shaken up and anxious from the encounter. I thought it was unfair of him to expect me to know the bars were his, as he hadn\u2019t left a note saying so, but I wonder if I really should have been more discerning and realized they belonged to someone. I did buy him a brand new box right after work and put it in the freezer for him the very next day. I just feel so guilty for this still.

You didn't know, and you certainly more than made up for your error by buying him a whole box of Klondike Bars. You also apologized. \n\nYou're obviously a sensitive person who really takes these things to heart. Here's how I handle those haunting \"Argh! I was an idiot!\" memories: I set the statute of limitations at 7 days. After 7 days, I can no longer prosecute myself for those misdemeanors. \n\nYou're a good person. Ease up on yourself.", "YTA you knew they weren\u2019t yours and you should have asked someone. It\u2019s not like you saw a bunch of other people eating them on a certain festive day. You just wanted them and probably thought nobody would know. You were young, but old enough to know better.", "Honest mistake. You replaced them. The custodian just let you know who they belonged to. No real harm done, just take it as a lesson learned: ask before you take.", "YTA/ESH. You should have asked before taking anything that isn\u2019t yours. In a shared work environment you can\u2019t assume anything is shareable. It was an honest mistake and you owned up to it and apologized and even took action of replacing what you too and more. \n\nAlso. The coworker sucks too because you gotta label anything that\u2019s yours. If you don\u2019t you\u2019ll be sorry. Coworker was lucky you were nice to apologize and replace. You coulda been a total dick and not owned up to your mistake.", "It\u2019s a lesson everyone should learn.  Workplace etiquette - don\u2019t take food that isn\u2019t yours unless it\u2019s very very clearly there to share.  You shouldn\u2019t have taken them, but nice job riding the mistake quickly.", "INFO\n\nWhen the staff bring food to share, do they leave notes saying it is good for everyone?", "NTA. This sounds like an honest mistake given that sharing is a common thing. And you immediately offered to replace them.", "NAH. It was a mistake, and you replaced them. As long as you stopped, you\u2019re good!\nI had a coworker keep taking my personal food. I confronted him but He kept taking them. \nHad to get a mini fridge in my office!", "This is one of those things that you just learn as you go through life. If he never said anything, you would have never known. Now you know. NAH. Kudos to you for handling it professionally by apologizing and replacing them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Generally speaking in communal kitchen spaces, I would err on the side of not taking food unless expressly told its for sharing.", "YTA. Pro tip: NEVER EVER take anyone\u2019s food in the fridge or freezer at your job, unless the person gave you permission. Never assume you can take it because it\u2019s there without a name on it. If it\u2019s not yours, it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s. DON\u2019T STEAL OTHER PEOPLE\u2019S FOOD.", "AH behavior for taking them in the first place (why would you take food that you weren't expressly told was for everyone to share?), but you owned up to your mistake by admitting to it and especially by buying him a new box. You learned your lesson and atoned, so I'd chalk this up to a mistake and not an ultimate YTA.", "NAH. You made a mistake, apologized, and bought him another box as soon as you realized you'd messed up. Yeah, you screwed up by eating his Klondikes, but bad judgement is human. It doesn't make you an asshole.", "Thank you so much for your kind reply. I really appreciate your opinion, and I especially appreciate that advice you gave on setting weekly limitations. It\u2019s never good to beat yourself up for anything too much. We are all human, and I should remember more that because I am one, I will do stupid things sometimes! I can definitely be really sensitive and am affected easily by people being upset with me (I tend to feel extreme guilt over even the small things), but it was a learning experience (I\u2019ll never take food unless I know it\u2019s okay). Again, thank you so much for your response. It means a lot to me!", "I understand, and thank you for replying. I don\u2019t mean to excuse my actions, but there was another time I\u2019d seen many of my fellow coworkers taking ice cream out of a package that was in the freezer during their lunch break, so I thought the Klondike bars were okay to take too. I have learned from this mistake, though, and will never take food unless I\u2019ve been explicitly told it\u2019s okay for me to have it.", "You\u2019re right. It definitely won\u2019t happen again. I truly felt bad, just taken off guard. I\u2019ve learned from this experience and won\u2019t take food unless I know it\u2019s okay to.", "Good question. No, they don\u2019t, at least not any of the times I\u2019d seen it\u2014they usually just leave them out on a counter, and I\u2019d see various coworkers taking from it whenever I was in the room.", "It\u2019s an honest mistake to take food that isn\u2019t yours?", "Thank you so much for replying. I know it was silly of me to assume, but I\u2019d seen coworkers sharing packaged ice cream before, and thought the Klondikes were okay to take too. It\u2019s nothing I\u2019d ever let happen again.", "Thank you for replying! I definitely did stop after that! I felt so guilty that I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to take anything that I knew without a doubt was for everyone. I\u2019m sorry to hear about your coworker! In his case, he knew the food was yours and still kept stealing it. I\u2019m sorry for you!", "You have a good point. I hadn\u2019t meant to steal anything, but I really did feel awful for taking it once I learned they were his. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll ever do again.", "ESH\n\nYou have to learn to read the room. If it\u2019s stuff out on the counter like cake or cookies, it\u2019s pretty obvious that it\u2019s for everyone. If it\u2019s stuff in the fridge, probably not for sharing unless noted otherwise. The custodian should have labeled the Klondike bars are not for sharing, though.", "I didn\u2019t intentionally take food that wasn\u2019t mine. I know that doesn\u2019t make it right, but I truly hadn\u2019t meant to steal. I won\u2019t ever do anything like it again, though.", "That\u2019s true. If it\u2019s hard for me to tell, I simply won\u2019t  take anything. It\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Thank you for your input; I appreciate it so much."]}
