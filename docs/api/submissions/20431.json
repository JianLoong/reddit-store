We recently got engaged (last month! yay!) and she said she wanted to treat us to a surprise trip with her family. The surprise trip ended up being a weekend getaway at a popular beach town near where we live. We were both very excited to join them and spend time with their super cute toddler who's only 3!\n\nThe issue starts at the hotel check-in. Both me and my fiance are aware that his sister tends to be very frugal, but we've never commented on it since they are not well off financially. However, the hotel that she surprised us with ended up being a 1-star motel in a notoriously dangerous area. Upon entering our room, my fiance and I were shocked to find how dirty and disgusting the conditions were (e.g., fresh stains on sheets, clump of hair in shower drain, dead cockroach in corner). My fiance went out around 10pm to get us ice and he ended up being solicited by two prostitutes. I also went down around 10:30pm to ask for more towels from the lobby and I was catcalled and leered at by two very sketchy men. In fact, one even tried following me until he saw I was walking to the lobby.\n\nFinally, around 11:00pm I told my fiance that I did not feel happy nor safe staying in the motel. I asked him if he wanted to relocate to another hotel. He agreed and apologized for the conditions, but initially said we should just tough it out for two nights. But after I told him I was catcalled and followed, he agreed with me and said we should leave. And so we got an Uber and left to a nearby Hilton. I sent a text in our GC around midnight letting them know that we felt a bit unsafe and uncomfortable at the hotel due to some encounters/harassment and decided to stay at another hotel. I thanked them and apologized profusely. I asked my fiance if we should offer to move them to the new hotel on us, but he said no because he believed his sister would feel insulted. My fiance separately venmo'd her $200 to cover the costs of the motel even though it was only (\\~$40/night).\n\nThe next morning, I wake up at 8am to a text from her SIL basically saying that they were \"deeply hurt and offended\" by my actions and to call them ASAP. We ended up meeting them back at the motel and she and her husband completely blew up at us. She called us \"ungrateful\" and \"classist\", even going so far to directly call me \"high-maintenance.\" She told us that she spent $100 on our accommodations, which was all that she could afford, and we \"threw it in her face.\" I went into the conversation very apologetic, but once she started insulting us, I told her off as well. We ended up parting ways and have not spoken to each other since, except for a text from SIL saying she wants a genuine apology from us. I don't believe I owe her any more apologies.

We\u2019re going to move to a different hotel and would be happy to move you also\u201d that would have been a different conversation. You\u2019re well within your rights to move, but she\u2019s within her rights to feel hurt when she was trying to do something nice for you (even though it didn\u2019t work out as expected). no one\u2019s an asshole here, but maybe there\u2019s a better way to communicate on all ends.", "Why do you care so much about a \"classist\" comment coming from someone frugal ?", "Yeah until sister in law sorts herself out I wouldn\u2019t travel with her, I would be paranoid about the nasty bugs she\u2019s bringing from all the dirty places she likes to frequent", "Exactly, I wouldn't have brought anything in the house before checking it over thoroughly. Also, cockroaches. She said there was a dead one. Who is to say if they put their bags down, a live one didn't crawl into a bag.", "I thought of the 3 year old.\n\nWhat if SIL booked online and the pictures looked nothing like what they came to?

It happens, and definitely could have been handled a little better by OP.\n\nLuckily I had not spent all my money, and left as soon as I could get another room booked. Should have just spent the extra $30 for the Holiday Inn Express in the first place.", "With her toddler!  Ick!!", "NTA.  I\u2019m sure she was just embarrassed and lashed out.  I let a friend book a room for us after a concert like 15 years ago.  Never again.  I still think about that gross hotel room.  I always book the accommodations now.", "I'd normally say you're the Asshole, but given the dangers and filth and hookers, I'd say NTA for this one, if everything is true", "NTA- If that's all she could afford, then I can see why she might have felt hurt. However, those feelings should have quickly died once she saw how uncomfortable you and your fianc\u00e9 were. You more than compensated her for the money, and you paid for your own hotel yourselves.", "NAH\n\nOh jeeze\n\nYou were right to leave.... But she is right to be upset and offended.\n\nSo, this was a no win situation.\n\nThe hotel was seriously sketchy and you were right to leave. But, there was absolutely no way for you to do so without insulting your SIL. \n\nShe has no money, this is what she could afford. She was trying to do something really nice and generous and was feeling good about it. Which you wrecked. Her family had to stay at this place as well, so you leaving was extra-insulting since it had to be good enough for her and her own child, but not for you. Which means you are skirting dangerously close to calling her a bad mom territory, and no one can come back from that unscathed. Every single piece of evidence you'd bring up to justify moving to the Hilton (the hookers, it being dirty, the catcalling) would be taken as more and more of you shitting on her gift as sub par and lacking.\n\nYou pretty much called her and her family garbage people who belonged in this environment you couldn't stand to be in for even a few hours. When they made sacrifices to include you and this is likely their normal, possibly even their \"special\". So yeah, there's going to be some very very hurt feelings. \n\nShe is likely deeply embarrassed this was all she could offer and your rejection of it has caused that embarrassment and shame to manifest as anger.\n\nThere truly was no winning here.\n\nI think you need to suck it up and give a genuine apology, or at least turn it over to your fiance to do so.", "TLDR, once I saw the term 1 star motel, that was enough to make me know you're NTA.

But I do think you should pretend you are and apologize.\n\nSIL is not well off, but she still extremely generously invited you on a family vacation with her and spent the absolute most she could afford. It was a gift.  That motel sounds horrible, and I'm not saying you should have stayed somewhere you felt unsafe, but you were given the absolute best she could afford and decided it wasn't good enough. She is rightly extremely hurt. Just apologize, emphasize a terror of cockroaches or something, and try to make it up to her.", "LOL NTA. Wtf.", "NTA. Safety and health should be the sole issues here. The place was dirty and potentially dangerous. 'Nuf said.", "If I had to choose NAH. I understand why you left but I think your SILs anger is justifiable. I think you should give her a sincere apology.", "NTA! I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you! You do **NOT** owe SIL an apology whatsoever! In fact, she owes **YOU** a massive one! You were catcalled and followed, and I don\u2019t blame you for feeling unsafe!", "Absolutely NTA\n\nDangerous and unsafe, on it's own, is enough of a reason not to stay there.\n\nGross and dirty, on it's own, is enough of a reason not to stay there.\n\nAll of that together? Hell no, get out of there.", "NTA. Look, safety is a non-negotiable. This is a tough one and it likely will be a point of contention for the entirety of your relationship. Sounds like they were trying to genuinely do a nice thing. And it's unfortunate that it turned out this way, but if you were being harassed and followed, then you made the right call.", "NTA. Seeing the stained sheets and cockroach carcass would be enough for me to leave because I'd be worried about bed bugs.", "Nta, but I think there's room for improvement. I'm not sure why you refunded the money, and why you refunded extra? That does look like flaunting it, and I can see how spending all you can afford for a gift, and then having that gift just casually returned twice makes you feel unappreciated.\n\nPerhaps you can spin it as: the gift is the holiday; and spending time together, and that is a success.", "NTA. Two words: bed bugs. \nAnother few words: STDs, junkie flophouse, possible mugging.", "NTA. Honestly I would have left a lot earlier but the active prostitution and very much potentially being assaulted takes the cake.", "Yup.

The issue that causes people to build fenced in suburbs is *safety*. The issue that causes people to hire private guards is *safety*. Just because that\u2019s the issue doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t classist. \n\nGood for you for getting out of a situation that was unsafe, but she\u2019s probably upset that she can\u2019t afford safety and thinks you did \u2018stupid rich people things\u2019 by not taking what she feels like are appropriate and reasonable measures (like not leaving your room to wander around a sketchy part of town). When your solution to not feeling safe is to go stay at (literally) a Hilton she probably feels like you did something lacking in common sense and \u2018fixed\u2019 it by throwing money at it. \n\nSo you aren\u2019t wrong to leave an unsanitary and unsafe environment but to her it looks an awful lot like you literally can\u2019t spend a single night not staying in a stereotypically upper class hotel.
