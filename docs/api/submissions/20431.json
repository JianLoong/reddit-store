We recently got engaged (last month! yay!) and she said she wanted to treat us to a surprise trip with her family. The surprise trip ended up being a weekend getaway at a popular beach town near where we live. We were both very excited to join them and spend time with their super cute toddler who's only 3!\n\nThe issue starts at the hotel check-in. Both me and my fiance are aware that his sister tends to be very frugal, but we've never commented on it since they are not well off financially. However, the hotel that she surprised us with ended up being a 1-star motel in a notoriously dangerous area. Upon entering our room, my fiance and I were shocked to find how dirty and disgusting the conditions were (e.g., fresh stains on sheets, clump of hair in shower drain, dead cockroach in corner). My fiance went out around 10pm to get us ice and he ended up being solicited by two prostitutes. I also went down around 10:30pm to ask for more towels from the lobby and I was catcalled and leered at by two very sketchy men. In fact, one even tried following me until he saw I was walking to the lobby.\n\nFinally, around 11:00pm I told my fiance that I did not feel happy nor safe staying in the motel. I asked him if he wanted to relocate to another hotel. He agreed and apologized for the conditions, but initially said we should just tough it out for two nights. But after I told him I was catcalled and followed, he agreed with me and said we should leave. And so we got an Uber and left to a nearby Hilton. I sent a text in our GC around midnight letting them know that we felt a bit unsafe and uncomfortable at the hotel due to some encounters/harassment and decided to stay at another hotel. I thanked them and apologized profusely. I asked my fiance if we should offer to move them to the new hotel on us, but he said no because he believed his sister would feel insulted. My fiance separately venmo'd her $200 to cover the costs of the motel even though it was only (\\~$40/night).\n\nThe next morning, I wake up at 8am to a text from her SIL basically saying that they were \"deeply hurt and offended\" by my actions and to call them ASAP. We ended up meeting them back at the motel and she and her husband completely blew up at us. She called us \"ungrateful\" and \"classist\", even going so far to directly call me \"high-maintenance.\" She told us that she spent $100 on our accommodations, which was all that she could afford, and we \"threw it in her face.\" I went into the conversation very apologetic, but once she started insulting us, I told her off as well. We ended up parting ways and have not spoken to each other since, except for a text from SIL saying she wants a genuine apology from us. I don't believe I owe her any more apologies.

She doesn't sound like a good person and the fact that she expects you to apologize after she put you both in danger is insane. I'd tell her to fuck off, and not to come back until she sorts herself out.", "Ask her what kind of mother takes her child to say in a place with hookers and roaches.", "I think if you had approached them and said \u201chey listen this just happened and I don\u2019t feel safe. We\u2019re going to move to a different hotel and would be happy to move you also\u201d that would have been a different conversation. You\u2019re well within your rights to move, but she\u2019s within her rights to feel hurt when she was trying to do something nice for you (even though it didn\u2019t work out as expected). no one\u2019s an asshole here, but maybe there\u2019s a better way to communicate on all ends.", "Why do you care so much about a \"classist\" comment coming from someone frugal ?", "Yeah until sister in law sorts herself out I wouldn\u2019t travel with her, I would be paranoid about the nasty bugs she\u2019s bringing from all the dirty places she likes to frequent", "Exactly, I wouldn't have brought anything in the house before checking it over thoroughly. Also, cockroaches. She said there was a dead one. Who is to say if they put their bags down, a live one didn't crawl into a bag.", "I thought of the 3 year old.\n\nWhat if SIL booked online and the pictures looked nothing like what they came to? Maybe SIL was embarrassed? Spent all she had, couldn't afford to go anywhere else.\n\nI wonder what would have happened if brother would have been called, \"This just happened. We appreciate the thought. We love spending time with all of you. Why don't we all go to (new location)? Our treat.\"\n\nThe world will never know. Lol", "Yeah, sneaking out feels shady, especially since they left SIL and family at the dangerous motel by themselves.", "That\u2019s the first thing I thought about . I\u2019m getting itchy just thinking about it, and the sister in law lied down and slept there ? \ud83e\udd2e", "She should have apologized like a grown woman and explained the situation. They all could have went somewhere else together", "Yeah, I recently booked a cheaper (national chain) hotel online, looked fine enough from the pics, but apparently they had cleared out all the garbage and drug dealers just for the pics, and used the one non-nightmare room for the pics as well. It happens, and definitely could have been handled a little better by OP.\n\nLuckily I had not spent all my money, and left as soon as I could get another room booked. Should have just spent the extra $30 for the Holiday Inn Express in the first place.", "With her toddler!  Ick!!"]}
