We recently got engaged (last month! yay!) and she said she wanted to treat us to a surprise trip with her family. The surprise trip ended up being a weekend getaway at a popular beach town near where we live. We were both very excited to join them and spend time with their super cute toddler who's only 3!\n\nThe issue starts at the hotel check-in. Both me and my fiance are aware that his sister tends to be very frugal, but we've never commented on it since they are not well off financially. However, the hotel that she surprised us with ended up being a 1-star motel in a notoriously dangerous area. Upon entering our room, my fiance and I were shocked to find how dirty and disgusting the conditions were (e.g., fresh stains on sheets, clump of hair in shower drain, dead cockroach in corner). My fiance went out around 10pm to get us ice and he ended up being solicited by two prostitutes. I also went down around 10:30pm to ask for more towels from the lobby and I was catcalled and leered at by two very sketchy men. In fact, one even tried following me until he saw I was walking to the lobby.\n\nFinally, around 11:00pm I told my fiance that I did not feel happy nor safe staying in the motel. I asked him if he wanted to relocate to another hotel. He agreed and apologized for the conditions, but initially said we should just tough it out for two nights. But after I told him I was catcalled and followed, he agreed with me and said we should leave. And so we got an Uber and left to a nearby Hilton. I sent a text in our GC around midnight letting them know that we felt a bit unsafe and uncomfortable at the hotel due to some encounters/harassment and decided to stay at another hotel. I thanked them and apologized profusely. I asked my fiance if we should offer to move them to the new hotel on us, but he said no because he believed his sister would feel insulted. My fiance separately venmo'd her $200 to cover the costs of the motel even though it was only (\\~$40/night).\n\nThe next morning, I wake up at 8am to a text from her SIL basically saying that they were \"deeply hurt and offended\" by my actions and to call them ASAP. We ended up meeting them back at the motel and she and her husband completely blew up at us. She called us \"ungrateful\" and \"classist\", even going so far to directly call me \"high-maintenance.\" She told us that she spent $100 on our accommodations, which was all that she could afford, and we \"threw it in her face.\" I went into the conversation very apologetic, but once she started insulting us, I told her off as well. We ended up parting ways and have not spoken to each other since, except for a text from SIL saying she wants a genuine apology from us. I don't believe I owe her any more apologies.

So if you expect anything more from us that will not happen.", "The problem is they sent $200 to the SIL so she wasn't out any money, she likely had enough to cover the cost of her own room and the room she got for the OP. So she got mad at them for leaving, paying for their own room and then paying her for the inconvenience of leaving.\n\nThe SIL is a huge AH, there is no way this is a NAH situation. Being embarrassed is not an excuse to berate someone. Unless she expected the OP to also pay for an upgraded hotel too.", "NTA. It is one thing if the hotel doesn't have amazing services or amenities, but a sketchy dingy motel is a whole nother story.", "Info: is SIL a methhead?", "The bed bugs fought a war with the cockroaches for control of the room. The bed bugs won and left the cockroach carcass as a warning to the rest.", "I don't think it's a brothel in the literal sense that it's a place dedicated to hookers with a madam. I think it's just a motel which is frequently used by hookers because they don't enforce rules or might offer hourly rates.", "I accidentally booked a room in what was essentially a brothel in Mexico City. It didn't look all that bad online and was cheap. We got there in the early afternoon and there were lots of scantily clad women offering their services just outside the door to the hotel. We got to our room, and the only thing on TV was porn. We had booked for a few nights, but we got out of there after the first night of listening to constant, loud sex from the rooms around us.", "I agree that she is lashing out because she is embarrassed. However, that reaction is inappropriate for an adult. Bless her for trying to give a nice gift, it's unfortunate that OP and her husband were followed and harrassed but sister should've handled her embarrassment by being apologetic. No doubt sister didn't mean to gift them an unpleasant stay, but she has a lot of nerve to lash out.", "\"Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable\", as it were.", "Well, if THAT's your definition of being classist, then there is nothing wrong whatsoever with being classist then... despite the term clearly being meant to be derogatory in everyday usage.", "And clearly some people blindly believe everything they read on the Internet... its not that deep yikes..", "Because only methheads are poor?", "I'd rather sleep in my car over a seedy motel.", "Three-year-old will not remember if they were on vacation or not.", "Hence NTA.", "Because in her mind it is safe as long as you don\u2019t do something monstrously silly like leave the room after dark for any reason. \n\nGrowing up I used a train station that had quite a reputation for being unsafe. When I wanted to bring friends over from school, I\u2019d bring them home through the train station and I\u2019d always be surprised that they were worried about it. It was fine as long as you didn\u2019t go there after dark. I was always fine after all. \n\nI\u2019m sure the sister felt the same way. It was fine, just don\u2019t break the rules that her upbringing impressed on her, and OP, who does not know these rules, just felt unsafe. In exactly the same way that it\u2019s safe to go to a zoo, but not to jump the fence and the ditch and fuck around in the big cats exhibit. It would probably never occur to her that OP would be unsafe because obviously she would have the common sense to not wander around that area right? But OP doesn\u2019t have these assumptions because she has a very different set of experiences.", "This is where the 'classist' thing comes in too.\n\n\"Oh, MY option wasn't GOOD ENOUGH for Miss Prissy and her baby???\"", "Okay, OP does say SIL isn\u2019t financially well off, though she also doesn\u2019t explicitly say SIL is poor. SIL is still the asshole regardless, though. Not for picking this hotel, but for her reaction when OP told her what happened and that they didn\u2019t feel safe in the hotel. SIL **absolutely** should have apologized to OP for what OP went through rather than getting so mad about OP switching hotels. I stand by my original comment.", "Absolutely not, it was just a joke. No offense intended.", "A meth lab", "Do you regularly cat-call women? It\u2019s just from your replies, you seem to think that women should be ok with that, so just wondering if it\u2019s something you like doing, and expect women to put up with it. If so, stop it and grow up.\n\nYou also seem to be acting like some saviour of the poor but you\u2019re coming across as really clueless. I grew up working class and my parents would rather not take us on holiday at all than make their children stay someone they felt was unclean and unsafe, they\u2019d put the money towards day trips instead. You seem to not understand that being poor doesn\u2019t mean having no standards and then you accuse other posters of hating poor people.", "Working class isn\u2019t poor. So it sounds like you\u2019re the clueless one. I went without dental care for over a decade glasses, no clothes food, so my son had everything and was well taken care of. It took me 15 years to get all my teeth fixed due to that.\nAnd I am a woman I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted.

It's a hard no.  No, you don't owe her an apology, just a gentle explanation about how dirty, AND DANGEROUS, that hotel seemed to be.  NTAH.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH bc it\u2019s really fair to not want to stay in a motel like that. Especially in a dangerous location. But even tho hubby told you not to offer to buy them a room i definitely would have anyways. You stated she\u2019s not rlly financially stable, which is totally understandable as to why she picked a cheap motel. I can also see why she\u2019s hurt as well bc she probably feels incredibly judged or like what she wanted to do nice for you \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough\u201d even tho she has little as is. I see BOTH of your points and both are valid. Idk how you guys would resolve this but I think you both need to understand each other and why you both chose to do what you did yk. Best to you guys tho!", "Yeah, this is super close to NAH territory. I don't think I have ever had an in-law make a generous, inclusive gesture like that (generous relative to income). Just feel bad for everyone that a fun family event went so far sideways.", "I mean... poor people don't have a ton of options.", "Sadly, security and the ability to get away or stay away from dangerous people is a privilege that most people don\u2019t realize they have.", "As someone who grew up poor and I'm not rich or anything now, I guess I'm classist af because nobody I know would go for that. There's poor and cheap, there's many degrees between 1 star brothel and the Hilton.", "But what about people breaking in the room to rob you (or worse)?", "Explain the joke?", "No, borax (as in 20 Mule Team detergent) is a desiccant meaning it dehydrates. You sprinkle it on baseboards under sinks etc. They eat it and die cos they can't keep hydrated. They don't \"infect each other\" with it unless idk do cockroaches French kiss?", "Where walls meet floors", "Ah gotcha", "NTA.  Safety is not a class thing.  It's a human need.  I have noped out of placed with far less extreme discomfort for a Holiday Inn or a Motel 6 where it was clean and safe.

NTA", "NTA.  You didn't feel safe and so you left. You sent her money to cover her costs.  She is being an AH and doesn't deserve an apology.  Or you could say \"I am sorry you are upset that we left a hotel in which we felt unsafe.  We have reimbursed you for your costs. Thank you for letting this go\"", "NTA. Why didn\u2019t your fiance talk to his sister? Siblings shouldn\u2019t have an issue communicating about stuff like this.", "Oof, I *was initially* going down the Y T A road feeling that despite the accommodations being below standard I think it\u2019s still good to be gracious towards someone\u2019s best intentions. \n\nBUT the totality of what you described is absolutely disgusting, unacceptable and not even close to a situation where you could just laugh it off and deal with it. Not even close! And that was just in one evening! I can\u2019t imagine what a full weekend in that hellhole would bring.\n\nHonestly, SIL is the AH from the get go. Given her financial situation, there was no need for her to offer up a beach trip if the only way is to get the most ultra-cheap accommodation possible and then expect others to just deal with it. She could have just had you over for a celebratory dinner ffs\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nUnclean hotels/motels are where I draw the line of trying not to hurt someone\u2019s feelings\u2014 you run the risk of bringing pests home with you.\n\nBeing not okay with that is not high maintenance or classist. Not to mention you felt unsafe.", "YTA", "Oh and your sister isn't frugal..  she is cheap...", "Plus, they paid her double what she paid. There's cheap and then there's trashy and this was trashy. I'm pretty easygoing but I wouldn't feel safe. And the sheets? Yuck. It's a prostitution motel.

It may not look great inside, but it looks worse with cockroaches running around the house. I lived in Florida and I had hardwood floors in my bedroom,  one night I heard a loud tapping under my bed, it was so loud that I thought it was a rat...when I turned on the light I nearly screamed as it was a huge cockroach! That's when I put it around the floorboards of my room.", "Sil seems to lack critical thinking and good judgement. While it was very kind of her to offer accomodation to Op and her partner, they went to Hilton. This means that they could afford an extra nice hotel on their own, or worse, that they had to go there because it was the only available option. Sil shouldn't have offer accomodation if this meant a dirty and dangerous hotel. As for the joke, well.. meth users aren't exactly known for their good critical skills. I hope I have been helpful, this is how I understood u/pottentiallyspiders comment.", "Borax is Boron and Sodium. There is no Boric Acid in Borax. \n\nYour name suggests you know what you\u2019re talking about, but evidently not. Do some googling about Boric Acid.", "Or, rather than spreading dirt to every corner of your home, you could dose a single roach with Boric Acid and they all die. \n\nBoric Acid is the primary tool professional pest control places use. It\u2019s non-toxic to cats and dogs and it does the job with literally zero mess aside from the roach corpses. \n\nAgain, dirt and lemon oil is some essential oil level advice.

I recently went on a trip around Europe and was alone for a chunk of it.  Some hotels are seriously sketchy and when you don't feel safe you don\u2019t feel safe.  I accidentally got into an area of Paris that i now refer to as pickpocket land and the hotel that i think could be rented by the hour (we're talking maze, tiny rooms and don't leave your room at night).   It was a serious mistake and totally put me off Paris.  I left the next morning and learned my lesson.

Keep her on very low contact.", "I get the SIL being upset.  They probably chose that hotel since it was the only one they could afford 2 rooms. If you knew they were on a very limited budget, you could have agreed to go,  but insisted on paying for your own accommodations. That way, they could have afforded to stay at a nicer place, too.", "Just gross.  I travelled with someone who checked every bed for signs of bed bugs and learned a lot about hotels recently.  I would never sleep comfortably in such a place.  My skin would be crawling.  But maybe their home is like that.
