We recently got engaged (last month! yay!) and she said she wanted to treat us to a surprise trip with her family. The surprise trip ended up being a weekend getaway at a popular beach town near where we live. We were both very excited to join them and spend time with their super cute toddler who's only 3!\n\nThe issue starts at the hotel check-in. Both me and my fiance are aware that his sister tends to be very frugal, but we've never commented on it since they are not well off financially. However, the hotel that she surprised us with ended up being a 1-star motel in a notoriously dangerous area. Upon entering our room, my fiance and I were shocked to find how dirty and disgusting the conditions were (e.g., fresh stains on sheets, clump of hair in shower drain, dead cockroach in corner). My fiance went out around 10pm to get us ice and he ended up being solicited by two prostitutes. I also went down around 10:30pm to ask for more towels from the lobby and I was catcalled and leered at by two very sketchy men. In fact, one even tried following me until he saw I was walking to the lobby.\n\nFinally, around 11:00pm I told my fiance that I did not feel happy nor safe staying in the motel. I asked him if he wanted to relocate to another hotel. He agreed and apologized for the conditions, but initially said we should just tough it out for two nights. But after I told him I was catcalled and followed, he agreed with me and said we should leave. And so we got an Uber and left to a nearby Hilton. I sent a text in our GC around midnight letting them know that we felt a bit unsafe and uncomfortable at the hotel due to some encounters/harassment and decided to stay at another hotel. I thanked them and apologized profusely. I asked my fiance if we should offer to move them to the new hotel on us, but he said no because he believed his sister would feel insulted. My fiance separately venmo'd her $200 to cover the costs of the motel even though it was only (\\~$40/night).\n\nThe next morning, I wake up at 8am to a text from her SIL basically saying that they were \"deeply hurt and offended\" by my actions and to call them ASAP. We ended up meeting them back at the motel and she and her husband completely blew up at us. She called us \"ungrateful\" and \"classist\", even going so far to directly call me \"high-maintenance.\" She told us that she spent $100 on our accommodations, which was all that she could afford, and we \"threw it in her face.\" I went into the conversation very apologetic, but once she started insulting us, I told her off as well. We ended up parting ways and have not spoken to each other since, except for a text from SIL saying she wants a genuine apology from us. I don't believe I owe her any more apologies.

From your descriptions about what it was like there, getting out ASAP was your best option. SIL isn\u2019t owed an apology and I\u2019d say she owes you a big one. The fact that you wanted to sleep in a place where you felt safe doesn\u2019t make you elitist and she is the classist one if she is accusing you of being a snob just because you were willing to spend your own money to escape from a bad situation.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't have stayed as long as you did if I walked into a motel that was dirty with a dead cockroach in the corner. \n\nIn fact, I went on a trip with a friend that booked us a motel. I walked in saw one cockroach and immediately walked out, told her I refused to stay there and ended up booking us better accommodations. \n\nIt's not dramatic, disrespectful or classist to want to stay in a safe comfortable hotel. Also your fianc\u00e9 sent them $100 more than they actually paid so they didn't lose anything by having y'all move. \n\nYour SIL needs to put her ego aside and let it go. If you plan a trip together again, make sure you book your own accommodations separately.", "NTA. Your safety and security come first. I would have done the same thing without a second thought.", "NTA. It is one thing if the hotel doesn't have amazing services or amenities, but a sketchy dingy motel is a whole nother story.", "NTA for feeling unsafe and upgrading your situation. You don\u2019t have to stay somewhere you\u2019re uncomfortable to make other people happier. Their feelings are their own responsibility. Their reaction was not appropriate.", "NTA - if you felt unsafe, it was better to get out of that environment. Plus the fact that it was in disgusting condition makes it even worse.", "I don't sleep well in places other than my home. And in a dirty, sketchy place. I would not have even brought my stuff in.  Ewww. She was paid for her efforts. NTA.", "Nta. You were as polite as you could have been until she started attacking you personally. Your first responsibility is to your own safety, that\u2019s not classist but it is a privilege to even have an option. Which is not anything to apologize for, just appreciate.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do it because it was a one star hotel, you did it because you didn\u2019t feel safe there.", "NTA, but very close to N A H for me. It sucks if that's all they can afford and I understand why her feelings were hurt. If I were in the same position as her, I would be more embarrassed than mad that my hotel choice was so bad. That being said, she shouldn't have gotten that mad at you if you were being apologetic.", "NTA at all. The one time to *not* be frugal is when you're paying for accommodations for other people, especially family. I get having a tight budget, but there's ways to find good deals and prices on hotels.\n\nPersonally, I would not prefer to stay in disgusting rooms with cockroaches over spending just a bit more money and being in a clean room and not having to fear for my safety (especially when they have a three year old child?).\n\nIf it's meant to be a surprise for someone else, maybe try to save up and spring a little bit more so the surprisees are not in dirty rooms or just do something else for them that's within your budget.\n\nI don't blame you for leaving, I would never let her book accommodations ever again.\n\n(Edited due to some misreading on my part)", "It\u2019s not classist to want to feel safe.\n\nNTA\n\nJust wondering if you told them which hotel you went to or just said you relocated? Won\u2019t change my judgement but might make me understand her feelings.", "NTA\n\nFrom the way you described it. This seems to be a motel frequented by sex workers and their clients. Not a great place for anybody else.", "OY! NTA\n\nIn gift giving, it is mostly the thought that counts. What was SIL's thought here? \n\nA hotel room with cockroaches is not \"a treat\" - neither is being catcalled or propositioned. She did not do \"something nice\" for you. \n\nIf you have a budget of $100 then a meal at a nice restaurant or a humongous gift basket would be an appropriate and likely appreciated gift. If you cannot afford a getaway where your guests feel safe and comfortable, then do something else. SIL created this situation and she owes you an apology for ruining the weekend.", "NTA. I would be embarrassed to put someone up in a shithole hotel as bad as that. That\u2019s a liability, not a gift.", "That is disgusting and you should count yourself lucky if you didn\u2019t get bedbugs as an extra \u201cgift\u201d too considering the conditions of the place. NTA at all, but I find myself feeling sorriest for their poor toddler who is going to grow up with a parent who thinks a hooker hotel is an appropriate family space.", "NTA\n\nThis was an unexpected \u201cgift\u201d she was getting everyone. This was not money she had to or was expected to spend. She created a situation to spend this money on family. If she could not afford safe & clean accommodations, not luxury or high end but just clean & safe, she should not have attempted to orchestrate this event on her own dime. She could have just taken everyone out to a dinner instead if that\u2019s within her budget.", "NTA", "NTA, she booked you a room at a dangerous hotel but was more concerned with being offended than the safety of you and your fianc\u00e9. That\u2019s wild.", "NTA I'd sleep in my car before I slept in that place. One doesn't book one star accomodations and expect a thank you. One books one star accomodations when absolutely nothing else is available and apologizes that nothing else was available.", "NTA. Your SIL fucked up and got the cheapest fleabag motel. Not hard to read the reviews in Google Maps.", "NTA. Pride come before the fall. She\u2019s too proud to acknowledge or accept your feelings", "Nta. Ridiculous! A gift should never be a burden on the recipient. She should be apologizing.", "NTA. If you aren\u2019t comfortable, you don\u2019t have to accept that gift. I\u2019m sorry that they feel so hurt and insulted. They should try getting you a gift you like that is within their price range. I couldn\u2019t afford a fancy vacation for my whole family either. It\u2019s okay. But trying for something that\u2019s very expensive and reducing the quality until it\u2019s no longer a nice gift just doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m sure you and your fianc\u00e9 would have been appreciative of another gesture that didn\u2019t cost so much money. Their insecurities are something they will have to work out. I\u2019m sorry it went that way and things are so tense and hostile. It\u2019s not your fault, though.", "Nta \nDid they stay at the same hotel, they booked for you? Or another hotel?", "NTA. I almost stayed at a hotel like that. Left ASAP. It\u2019s a health and safety concern. She shouldn\u2019t have taken it so personally.", "NTA. It was a safety and comfort issue.", "NTA. They got hotel rooms in a dump. You didn't feel safe (for good reason). You were not rude about it.", "NAH. \n\nHer feelings are hurt and she\u2019s likely humiliated that she picked a hotel that was so bad you guys left and went somewhere else. \n\nBut no. No way. You couldn\u2019t pay me to stay in a room like that. You stayed way longer than I would have.", "NTA I would have done the exact same thing AND she was reimbursed so she has no reason to be upset. I do get maybe she was hurt but just know your NTA. I\u2019ve being in similarish situations and unfortunately I tend to just fake a sincere apology for dumb shit like this. my SO and I will talk shit about it the second we leave cause we both know how ridiculous the situation is.", "If it was just a cheap, basic, and clean hotel, I\u2019d have said stick it out. But nothing you described would make me comfortable, at all. \n\nNTA\n\nTo keep the peace though, you know their financial situation, and you knew it would hurt them when they were trying to do something nice. It\u2019s not a hill to die on. Explain to them what happened with the guy and how you were followed, leave it there and apologize, and say that you were grateful. Also suggest a group Airbnb next time.\n\nNAH", "NTA - it literally doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else for you to stay at another hotel.", "NTA- she was ok with you being in danger? You can't give someone a shitty gift and expect them to be grateful. Send her a moldy sandwich and tell her to be grateful", "YHITAH. Your Husband Is The AH. You are not an AH. What stood out to me was that instead of covering the two nights ($80) your husband sent *$200*. That was I hope- kindly intended but a real AH move- \u201cClearly this is all you can afford so here\u2019s well over twice the amount I actually owe you, obviously you need it\u201d. I imagine that\u2019s part of the anger. No, of course you should not have stayed since you felt unsafe and had reason to feel that way. And the SIL was awful to call you high maintenance.
