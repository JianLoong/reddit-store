You will get over them, they weren\u2019t even that important to you anyway. Just get over it\u201d\n\nI sat there shocked, the table went silent.\nAfter a few seconds, I looked up at her and told her that they were important and that I wouldn\u2019t just get over them because I loved them.\nI stopped and went to leave, and as I was at the door I turned back to her and said, \n\u201cI loved them more than I love you, I wish you were the one who died in an accident and not them because they were good people\u201d\nI know what I said was bad and I have apologised for it but she keeps bringing it up to everyone she knows. \nI was just so angry at what she said that I just said whatever was on my mind.\n\nI don\u2019t think I will forgive her as what she said was rude but I\u2019ll try to talk to her and try to understand why she said it.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1694309167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16en0lt/aita_for_yelling_at_my_cousin_at_family_dinner/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, you aren't wrong for what you said because she deserved it. What she said to you is not forgivable and neither is the fact that she kept pushing to talk about the accident.\n\nShe needs to learn what ptsd and survivors guilt are.\n\nI am so sorry for your your loss. I can't even imagine your pain.", "People unintentionally say a lot of stupid things to others who are grieving, but what your cousin said is one of the most insensitive I\u2019ve ever heard. Hard as it is to believe, she may have been trying to help. I can relate because my brother died tragically. At our support group, we sometimes share all the stupid things people say.\n\nPeople who haven\u2019t experienced a loss like yours think you can easily move on. But your pain and grief are still fresh. It takes years to reach a new normal. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, and I wish you the compassion and understanding you deserve.", "NTA - I would have said something similar but not apologized to that insensitive AH.  FAFO.", "NTA. You don't poke a bear and expect it not to react!", "....what she said wasn't rude, it was evil, vile and without empathy or common decency. I think of what I was like at 25 and I assure you, she would have had no flesh left on those bones by the time I was done. The fact she is this clueless at 29 means a serious wake up call was overdue and she got one. I would never speak to this person again....as if she had in fact, died that night, right there at the dinner table....done and forgotten just like she suggested. What you said was a very mean thing to say true enough, but when someone reaches in and tears at a broken heart they're going to loose a hand.\n\nOP honestly, I am so sorry for your loss and the incredible insensitivity of your cousin.....omg I am so pissed on your behalf. ANYONE that thinks she should get a pass for this or says you need to apologize or \"talk it out\" with her should walk off a cliff. Set a boundary that it is off limits for discussion....end of.\n\nNTA there's just no way you can be a bigger AH than your cousin.", "First, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nNTA.  What was said to you was absolutely horrible and shocking.   You\u2019ve offered your apology and what should happen next is your cousin accepts it but also reflects on why what she said was so inappropriate", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't have apologized for what you said. Because what she said was some seriously evil shit. By 29, she should have known better. There's simply no excuse.", "I don\u2019t think you are. What you said was a heat of the moment-emotion driven comment. What she said was just plain heartless and uncalled for. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you & I hope you are able to find peace in the situation.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. NTA - I can\u2019t believe your cousin had the audacity to say that to you and not expect a reaction. How\u2019s your family reacting to her comment?", "NTA. She deserved it. She's a permanent victim now.", "You say you apologized to her, but did she ever apologize to you? \nOP I have been in your shoes. It was horrible. I had a lot of insensitive and stupid things said to me after the accident, but not one person ever said anything cruel, or mean. You need to stop apologizing, and if you want to hear her out, that\u2019s incredibly kind of you. Nothing she says could ever excuse that comment, though. Please take my heartfelt condolences and know that while you won\u2019t ever get over the loss, one day you\u2019ll notice the pain is lessened and their memories will be of the good times, not the hard part you\u2019re living now.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I can't even begin to imagine your pain.\n\nMaybe just leave your cousin alone for a while, give her time to think about what she said. Good people are going to know that you were in pain here, justified pain to her cruel words so to hell with the ones that think she was right to say what she did.\n\nWhat you said was from grief and from a horrible insult from her. You apologized. You have no reason to now feel guilty.\n\nFocus on your healing. Grief is a bear. Be kind to yourself, allow yourself to feel all your feelings so they flow through you and be released. Rest, spend time with people who nurture you, and focus on healing.", "NTA, if they keep bringing it up, take your apology back and restate your original statement. \n\nUnless they are on the spectrum, there is no way they said that thinking it was good to say.", "You lost your cool. But that was totally understandable. Try not to do it again and don\u2019t worry about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She must have something wrong with her.", "Do real people talk like this?", "Yes, they do. 2 days after a miscarriage I was told by my dads friend that \"its a good you miscarried. The baby might have been born with Downs-syndrome, (pls tell me if I spelled this wrong), and we nearly aborted our daughter for that reason.\" \n\nThere are some absolutely horrible things that come out of people's mouths. It's been almost 10 years since, and I still get mad whenever I remember that conversation. \n\nOP, you are NTA. I lost my best friend in a car accident in 2016, and it still hurts to this day. The grief never goes away, but you will learn to cope as time goes on. \n\nMy thoughts are with you in this time of grief \ud83d\udc96", "My father died at age 93 (not unexpected) and then my husband died very unexpectedly 2 months later (age 52). A couple of weeks after that, one of my neighbors actually made a comment about bad things happening in threes (like was I worried about that?).\n\nIn his defense, the moment it came out of this mouth he realized how horrific it was, and apologized profusely. But 18 years later it still stings. So yeah, people do say incredibly stupid things when dealing with a death.\n\nNTA OP. I just sent up a Hail Mary for your friends that passed.", "I mean, tbf, I probably would have done the same thing \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 but he back tracked his comment.
