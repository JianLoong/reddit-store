They say adults should put kids ahead as they are indeed innocent, but they all overlook the emotional turmoil within an adult as the steps represent why the life course altered.

SHE IS THE PROBLEM, and I do feel bad for those kids, but that's not OP's problem.", "Then you can stay in your cave hermit!", "I could absolutely see them weaponizing it, filing for full custody just so they can force OP to take the kids when they want him to by threatening him not being able to see them again.\n\nThese two are both obviously selfish af.", "This needs to be higher. She is jealous he gets totally kid free time and she always has kids. These were decisions of her own making- she gets to live with the consequences.", "Totally. She (and her new husband) want alone time and are guilting OP to provide it.", ">I think they're half trying to foist them off on OP for some kid-free time.\n\n100% this! EX didn't care enough about her children's welfare enough NOT to cheat so I don't buy it for a second that she's suddenly worried about her step kids.", "I'm in a blended family. Yeah, kid free time is vital. It's not the ex's responsibility to provide that.\n\nMy son and my stepson are friends and and sometimes my son invites him over to his dad's for a hobby that they all enjoy and I definitely don't. It's not 'private' dad/son time, because there are other people there. Regardless, my ex is under no obligation to allow it. And my son is under no obligation to invite his stepbrother. They aren't small, so stepson doesn't need 'looking after'.", "She is, which is insane. Why on earth would bonding time between his ex\u2019s stepchildren and his children be his responsibility?! The assertion that they\u2019ll grow up not seeing OP\u2019s kids as stepchildren is also ridiculous, I think they will notice their *dad* being present", "Ding ding ding! We have a winner people.", "Yup.  I'm really not getting this.  I don't think they are step siblings.  I don't call my step brother's step sister my step sister.  And everybody's fine with that.  I agree she's trying to get some free babysitting here.", "Kids from the marriage she helped blow up.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Yup!!!!", "B I N G O\n\nBINGO!!!!!!!!!!!", "Winning answer right here!", "They\u2019re also delicious", "No I'll keep going! And bringing snacks! And even sneaking into movies haha!", "I am a step mother - we have a relationship with their adult step brother but when the kids were small hubby did not even go on the property of ex and her new husband.\n\nNO WAY would I take responsibility for children of someone I don't like or trust (I'm a Grandmother now and things happen!)", "And can I add\n\nI just love someone having an affair that destroys two marriages busting on her ex for \u201cputting his feelings ahead of two small children.\u201d\n\nUMM - like you did when you cheated with their Dad? \n\nAbsolute insanity!!!", "the dildo of consequence is seldom lubed", "FAAFO, Literally.", "Right? Cheating affects kids greatly too quite often. If not now then in the future when they start dating, grappling with who they want to be or look up to etc. She didn\u2019t give enough of a shit about her own kids or his to not cheat and neither did her affair partner. She has some fucking cheek to try to guilt OP into taking two kids that aren\u2019t his.", "You monster.", "Nice moral compass"]}
