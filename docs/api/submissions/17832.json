We did have our fair amount of fights but nothing big, just silly stuff, and no matter the amount of arguments we always had each other at the end of the day and I loved her. Fast forward to 2016, she suddenly became very ill and couldn't go out to play as much which led to her other friends not talking to her anymore and during that time we spent nearly everyday together, her home was like a second home to me. Being a dumbass, I never speculated as to what exactly her illness was and I didn't find out until 6 months before her death when I overheard my family talking. It was blood cancer and they were all talking about how little chance she had to survive. I was devastated, especially when she told me herself about her diagnosis and that my family didn't want ME to know about her cancer. A month before she passed away, her family moved really far from our place and I never got to meet her. I was aware that she wanted to meet me but I never got the chance. I was occupied with school activities and just brushed it off saying SHE WILL RECOVER I WILL SEE HER FOR SURE WE STILL HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. She passed on the 23th july of 2019. I had no idea that I would never see her again. Her death was hard for me to process at 14 years of age but I don't want to get into that. A few months ago S's parent had a babygirl and I am really happy for them. I was also worried about S's brother (15M) as in if he wanted to have another sibling at that age, but if they are happy that's none of my business. Everyone keeps on saying how S has return in the form of the babygirl and I'm still not over her death. Ofc I love the babygirl and I always smile at her photos and want to be an active big sister in her life but at the moment it's just too hard for me to even face the parents and the brother. \nI still haven't stepped a foot in their house since they moved to their place in 2019. My family thinks I'm rude and selfish for not stepping up and meeting the family but I am just not ready and need time.

It was not kind for everyone to keep you in the dark about the actual severity of her illness. It sounds like you would've spent more time with her if you'd known your time was limited. \n\nIt was very normal for you to be caught up in school and activities at that age. It was also very normal for you to experience denial. Denial is both a stage of grief and a powerful coping mechanism. It can help us keep moving forward in spite of terrible things happening to us or to people who we love.\n\nI was your current age when my mother died. She was diagnosed with lung cancer when I was in my first year of college. I was young, optimistic, and not without my own sense of denial. When my parents told me, I felt thankful that medical science was so progressed that she could be treated. \n\nThey already knew that it was terminal, but they were not able to say it in the face of my optimism. They also knew I'd put college on hold and stay if I really knew the stakes, so they chose not to tell me. It was not kind to me, but it wasn't an easy decision for them either. \n\nIn the years since she died, I've experienced a lot of different feelings and kinds of grief. I've been angry at myself for being naive, sad that I didn't spend as much time as I could've, disappointed that my parents kept information from me, embarrassed that I couldn't tell what was up on my own.\n\nIn the longer term, I've come to accept that my experience with grief and loss has been quite normal. There was a problem that was too big so I denied it. My mother and I, to some extent, avoided each other because we were concerned about preserving our own denial. She didn't want me to see her withering away. I didn't want her to be self-conscious. My dad struggled through being unprepared to lose his wife of 25+ years and coped by being the absolute best caretaker he could for her while stifling his own feelings as long as he could. \n\nAnyway, I'm not sure if any of that would be helpful to you. I just want you to take away that you've done nothing wrong. The cancer was wrong. Your friend deserved more time, and you deserved more time with her. Please don't beat yourself up about this. It doesn't help you and it doesn't help her. \n\nIt's okay to need more time before you meet your friend's younger sibling. You might have strong feelings about them treating the new baby as a replacement. \n\nRegarding your friend, consider what she would want to leave behind for you. Would she want you to carry forward the joy and love of your friendship and the memories that now belong to you alone? When you think of her, would she want you to feel pain and loss and regret, or to remember all the goodness you shared?", "That creeped me to the core.  That is not something that people who have processed their grief say, especially about a newborn.", "I'll just say that there is a high risk that the family will be assholes if they're saddling that new, innocent baby with all their grief and baggage over her dead sister.", "NAH\n\nIt is worth considering you haven\u2019t processed not prioritising seeing your friend before she passed away? That kind of guilt can destroy your peace. Hopefully you had/have therapy for try deal with that\u2026. \n\nYour family - I get their point - we have to survive in the societies and communities we live in plus they want you to live the happy moments around you - so I would say their intention isn\u2019t bad. \n\nIf you want to play a role in this kids life, you said \u201cbig sis\u201d - then you need to deal with the hurdles that are in front of you preventing you from making a step you clearly want to make - but feel you can\u2019t. Could that be the guilt? Could it be manifesting itself in different ways and weighing you down?\n\nTalk to someone Op - it\u2019ll be okay. \nYou were, and are in some ways, still that little kid that lost their friend. You\u2019ll carry their memory forever. Try to focus on all the great things you had to drown out any thought that may take you down a negative emotional path.", "NTA", "Exactly- the poor kid deserves a chance to be her own person.", "That poor kid will spend her whole life being criticized for not living up to her sister. That's seriously fucked up of the parents."]}
