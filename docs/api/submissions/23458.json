I got annoyed because my roommate kept coming into my room to ask things, or join the conversation. I know she wants to feel included, but I don't get spend time with just my best friend a whole lot, and she has her own whole room to get ready. So I asked her to stay out of mine as we are getting ready. \n\nShe seemed confused, but walked away. Then a bunch of girls all came into my room, which I also found annoying, but they don't have their own room in the apartment unlike my roommate, so I guess they had no choice. So I was annoyed but was okay with them coming in.\n\nThen my roommate once again tried to come in and join the conversation and I just lost it. I said loudly \"No, \\[roommate\\], stay the fuck out of my room\". I knew I went a little too far because she started tearing up and refused to come out that night. The rest of us still went out and had a good time. \n\nI know I sound like a massive asshole, but this isn't the first time this girl has invaded my privacy.

Close your door if you don\u2019t want people coming in.", "YTA, even more so because you\u2019re doubling down in the comments. You posted here because you wanted to hear people say that you\u2019re totally fine and roommate was in the wrong, you don\u2019t want to hear that maybe you\u2019re a jerk.", "YTA. Sounds like some people never grow out of middle school. You acted just like a nasty mean girl from middle school.", "YTA.  Your door was open and there were already multiple others in your room.

You **didn\u2019t** make it clear you wanted alone time with your BFF because you and your roommate invited a group of friends over, and then you *only* excluded your roommate. \n\nI know it\u2019s the most Reddit thing to do here, but it really feels like there is something else going on here.

You let ALL the other girls come into your room and then get mad that your RM wasn't \"respecting your privacy\"? What privacy? If you want privacy, shut the damn door. If you wanted privacy/time with your one friend, you wouldn't have let everybody else invade, you'd have also asked them to go use other rooms.\n\nI can give a /vague/ vote of the RM also being an AH just because she was asked once to leave and then came back anyway, but OP is most definitely an AH. You not only shouted and swore at her, you did so in front of your collective friend group, which would have humiliated her to no end. I'm not surprised she didn't go with you. You made her feel ridiculed and singled out, and that is never okay, but especially not for something as stupid as wanting to be included with all the other people present. You had plenty of other options. I feel like there's underlying animosity here that's not being addressed for you to have treated her that way even though there were a bunch of other people in your room when you supposedly wanted \"privacy.\"", "YTA. You wanted time alone with your bff but then proceeded to exclude her out of everything? You have a mean girl mentality. I hope your roommate moves out. Poor girl.", "YTA. Open door means the room is free to enter in a situation like this. If you didn't want someone in your room, you should've closed the door. And it also made total sense she came in a second time because everyone else was in your room. You were so rude and probably hurt her a lot. If you wanted to have time alone with your bff, you shouldn't have invited a group of girls over to get ready for a night out. That is generally a social activity that is done in a group.

Would you mind getting ready in your room?\"\n\nThat would have been much better than going full AH.", "Wow. YTA", "YTA.\n\nOnce the other girls came into your room your alone time was over anyway, no sense in making your roommate be the only one not in your room.", "Something just feels off about this story. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fake, but I don\u2019t know what it is.", "YTA- seriously how rude? You don\u2019t care about your roommate\u2019s feeling at all clearly.

Like that was vile.\n\nOntop of that, when she started crying what did you? Go after her and apologise? No. You went out and had a great time. Like wow this is infuriating to read, I really hope she leaves you lot, this is like the typical mean girl squad that arbitrarily choses a person to be left out.\n\nThis has nothing to do with you spending time with your best friend, you were all suppose to be getting ready for a night out and you singled her out even when everyone else was in your room.\n\nHonestly, the fact you even think youre partially in the right is staggering", "I get the idea of wanting to have privacy but your door was wide open suggesting that everyone was welcome. You need to be an adult and communicate without being a dick", "YTA\n\nYou're a nasty bully", "I have had a roommate like this. It drove me absolutely batshit and I ended up moving out early for a lot of reasons. That being said, YTA for singling her out. If you had stuck to your own wishes and kicked the other girls out too, it would be different. She was trying to be included in the group. Imagine being in her shoes. You\u2019d probably feel humiliated. You can keep the boundary of staying out of each other\u2019s rooms, but you owe her an apology for ostracizing her", "YTA. Nowhere in your post does it say you actually told your roommate that you wanted private time with your best friend, which is why your roommate was confused. Then you let all the other girls in, which sent the message everyone was free to come in, so your roommate again tried to join in, which would be natural because *some of the girls were her friends too*, but you excluded *only* her.

This is not something you should do again. \n\nit never ceases to amaze me how some people have such callous disregard for the feelings of others.

You were downright a bully in this situation. You were horrible to your roommate.

But in this case, you had other people in your room- multiple of them- and you singled out your roommate and YELLED AT HER for trying to join in on a group conservation.

If you don't want people wandering in then close the door.", "Dude YTA \n\nIf you just wanted to hang out with your best friend it would be different.

You don\u2019t appear to have asked your roommate to give you and friends privacy beforehand. You aren\u2019t clear if roommate was going out with you and your friends or if they were getting ready to go elsewhere. If roommate was part of the group to go out you were a part of then it\u2019s amazingly rude of you to keep shutting her out of the group getting ready.

Excluding someone from a group like you did is awful.", "YTA \n\nPut yourself in her shoes and think about how the exact same would make you feel. You purposely excluded her and embarrassed her in the process. You\u2019re not only an asshole, but extremely mean.

And most importantly were the group of girls your friends and not hers? Why were they there?", "YTA - I mean I get it if you\u2019re in your room alone wanting your own space. But literally everyone was congregating in your room. You sound like a fun person to live with /s\n\nYes you\u2019re entitled to your space, but if it was really about that then you would\u2019ve asked everyone else to leave not just your roommate. These kind of situations you need to really take a step back and decide if it\u2019s really the hill to die on, especially when you live with this person.", "I have no idea how you think you communicated that you want alone time with your best friend in the midst of this group gathering but typically if you invite a bunch of people to come over, they think they\u2019re hanging out with you, and if you have have your door open it\u2019s an invitation to come in. and if somebody isn\u2019t reading your mind, I\u2019ll take them aside and talk to them politely.

If you wanted to spend time with just the one friend why didn\u2019t you encourage the other girls to go out to a shared space? Also, why didn\u2019t you talk to anyone like an adult saying that you wanted to spend some one-on-one time with your best friend? Based on this snippet inside your life and personality, you sound high maintenance and difficult to live with.", "Yes and no. I understand she wanted to be included and she refused to follow your directive, you probably should have explained it to her that you wanted private time with your best friend, however, once your room filled up with the other girls, you really should have invited her to stay and join the conversation; she may have made a friend or two.

It's a pathetic argument. You sound like a whiny 14 year old arguing with their sibling.\n\nYour room might've been crowded. So why was one more person a problem? I can already hear your whiny reply,  \"because she had her own room.\" WRONG! The correct answer is because YTA.\n\nYour room became, de facto, the gathering room of the house.

The woman you live with wants to be friendly with you, your best friend, and the four other women you invited over.

So what? She should go and get ready on her own whilst everyone else hamgs out in OPs room and has a great time?
