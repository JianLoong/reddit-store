So I asked if she was showering tonight or in the morning, trying to plan because I def. need a shower too, and she said she wasn\u2019t planning on one. It\u2019s been, I believe (I don\u2019t keep a calendar) since Tuesday when she showered last. Maybe Monday. I kinda lost it, and said I shouldn\u2019t have to tell her that going 4-5 days without a shower when we\u2019re going out wasn\u2019t ok. She was instantly mad that I brought it up at all and stormed off to bed. I followed up with a text that basically said \u2018I couldn\u2019t believe she was throwing a tantrum because I told her she shouldn\u2019t go 4 days without a shower, and that while I started off trying to be gentle about it, she needed to take the hint, and that continuing to refuse to shower after someone says: \u2018hey I can *smell* you\u2019 is acting like a child.

Yeah, no shit. She\u2019s been on meds for that and another issue for a while, and while I\u2019ve had a fuck-ton of conversations with her about continuing to speak with her doc about which ones and their dosage because it seems to me that it\u2019s not a problem that is currently under control, that has been a **COMPLETE** non-starter.

Sometimes something as simple as turning the water on for her, just so that it\u2019s already started, can be enough to make it feel less daunting. It\u2019s not something you should necessarily have to do, but if she doesn\u2019t want to pursue other solutions it is at least another idea you can try.", "NAH.  I can see where your girlfriend's coming from, but you're definitely NTA. \n\nI've had severe, chronic treatment resistant depression for decades.  I've been in a state where showering was virtually impossible, and I could only manage it every 4-5 days.  The first couple of days, I felt overwhelming relief that it had *only* been 48 hours since my last shower so it was ok.  After that, there was steadily increasing guilt and shame about how disgusting I was, until the tipping point was reached and I could make the stupendous mental effort necessary to shower.  Then shame and self loathing that I'd made such a fuss about a perfectly simple little task, my god what's wrong with you you loser.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd if someone had *noticed* and called me on it, I would have wanted to die (more than I already did).  Personally I would probably have dissolved into an inconsolable mess of tears, shame and self loathing rather than try and deflect blame onto you; but I guess your girlfriend and I are different people.\n\nYour girlfriend is *not* OK, but that doesn't mean you're the bad guy for pointing out that *she stinks*.  She NEEDS to go back to her doctor, maybe even spend some time in hospital.  I'm so sorry you're both going through this, it's awful for both of you.", "YTA, mostly because calling her a child when you know this is caused by her depression is a dick move. Asking her to shower isn't, but escalating it with insults is not the way to go.\n\nDepression treated with only meds almost never works long-term. It should only really be done as a crutch for short-term issues or with therapy as the main treatment long-term. That's probably why she's so deep in it still that she can't get herself to shower, and on top of it has to deal with a boyfriend that calls her a child over it.\n\nI get it. Not showering IS gross, but telling her to up her meds and calling her a child is not gonna make her shower more often. Being compassionate towards her over something that she undoubtedly feels shame and guilt over, and maybe sitting down with her to research ways to help deal with depression symptoms is leagues better for a start.", "NTA I think some people mistake freedom for license. Your girlfriend sounds like one of them.\n\nYou can recognize that you have rights and freedoms, while having consideration for how your actions affect other people, taking that into consideration when you make your choices.\n\nLicense is thinking you have the right to act however you want with no need for consideration for other people and how your choices and actions affect others, while viewing any rejection of that as somehow disrespectful or unaccommodating.\n\nYour girlfriend technically has the right to not shower until her miasma causes eyes to water. She doesn't have the right to force others to be okay with it, with them doing whatever she wants them to, such as sharing a vehicle with her having to marinate in her stench for hours.", "NTA, hygiene matters. But as you said she has known mental health issues, so maybe try another tactic. Try asking her what the barriers to her showering are. Is it the effort? The time? Sensory issues (being wet/cold/too hot)? A dislike of being naked? I struggle with depression and my partner has a number of mental health issues plus autism so we are familiar with the difficulty in showering in this house. You need to move it from a moral/values issues (which is why she\u2019s defensive because being deemed \u201cdirty\u201d carries a lot of emotional baggage) to a logistics thing - how can we make it easier for her do self care? \n\nIn my partners case it turns out the layout of the bathroom and shower made things more difficult than it needed to be. They also worried about falling in the shower. We changed some things, got a shower stool and a hand held showehead, and it\u2019s much easier for them now. They also figured out a cleaning routine (wipes, wipes, baby) that works to keep acceptable hygiene when they just don\u2019t have the oomph to shower. Approach this has a solvable problem you can tackle together.", "NTA", "NTA\nFor me this would be a HUGE turn off not to mention my bedding being gross from someone who hasn\u2019t showered!", "INFO:   (I'm gonna get yelled at for this but ... )\n\nIs she not washing *at all* during those four days?   (As in,  is she what we call \"top and tailing\"?)   or is she not touching water at all?    Because I think those can be two very different situations,   y'know?", "NTA. This impacts you, and you can choose not to share space or go on visits with someone who smells. It is not disrespectful to point that out.

Especially since so many antidepressants can take 6-8 weeks to build up to the full dose and efficacy. Personally, I went to therapy for years before I tried meds and while it was immensely helpful, I didn\u2019t actually stop being depressed until I went to a psychiatrist found the right medication. It\u2019s been three years now and I\u2019m still on it and still doing great. Sometimes it is the right long-term solution.", "Yeah, knowing it stems from depression but calling her a child over it really makes me feel like it's a YTA thing as well. I know it is a hard thing to deal with, and can be frustrating. But thats not a good way to discuss it for sure.", "Hold up. I\u2019ve never told her to \u201cup her meds.\u201d I\u2019ve said she needs to talk with her doctor because the current regime is clearly NOT effective at treating her depression, for a variety of reasons most of which are not mentioned in this post because they are irrelevant. \n\nThere is a HUGE difference between the two, and to pretend that is the only way we\u2019ve ever talked about it is reductive and not very helpful. For the record I\u2019ve also suggested she talk with someone, repeatedly, even just one of the AI therapy-aid bots that had some decent clinical reviews, just anything at all instead of nothing. \n\nAlso, you probably need to source a claim like:\n\n>Depression treated with only meds almost never works long-term.\n\nFinally, I have a family history with depression, and I have suffered myself. How dare you a) assume I haven\u2019t done all of those things you listed, or b) make it my responsibility to shoulder the burden. If you MUST know, one of the other issues we have is that she\u2019s dragging me down with her.

The way I worded it was very black and white, but I'm not saying medication isn't a good tool. Using it with no other treatment whatsoever is just generally not an effective help for most people, especially with the amount of people suffering from treatment-resistant depression, and who have co-morbidities.", "I incorrectly assumed that talking about dosage meant upping her dosage, and that's my bad. I don't pretend that all you've ever done is talk to her about meds, it's just the only information in the post, and so I went off that. That's also why I didn't assume you've done other things, because the post doesn't mention any of them. It's not your responsibility AT ALL to shoulder any of this. I didn't say that. I was only commenting on you calling her a child and talking about meds dosages (which I made an incorrect assumption about), and suggesting another way to go.\n\nI don't think it's on you to deal with any of this, but you're on reddit asking whether you're the asshole. Based off of the post, I thought your reaction to her made you the asshole, because you can only glean so much from it. Your post asks if you're an asshole for insulting your girlfriend about her showering. I suggested being more compassionate about it. With more info, I honestly still think calling her a child was unnecessary, but I completely understand why you feel frustrated enough to do it. I don't think you \"just need to support her more\" or that you're not doing enough (you're clearly doing more than anyone should have to), for the record.\n\nIs any of this immense pressure and pain going to be eased by asking reddit about something that's clearly not the issue? This all is way heavier than whether or not you're an asshole for what you did in this one moment. \n\nThe first source I have is a study on cognitive therapy as opposed to anti-depressants specifically, but the contents are more nuanced than just that, and the conclusion talks briefly about the long-term benefits of combined treatment vs. medication on its own: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748674/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2748674/)\n\nThis source talks specifically about the combination of medication and therapy, which says: \"This research suggests that, for people with moderate depression, combination treatment should be offered before antidepressants alone\".
