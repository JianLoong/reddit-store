I can see where your girlfriend's coming from, but you're definitely NTA. \n\nI've had severe, chronic treatment resistant depression for decades.  I've been in a state where showering was virtually impossible, and I could only manage it every 4-5 days.  The first couple of days, I felt overwhelming relief that it had *only* been 48 hours since my last shower so it was ok.  After that, there was steadily increasing guilt and shame about how disgusting I was, until the tipping point was reached and I could make the stupendous mental effort necessary to shower.  Then shame and self loathing that I'd made such a fuss about a perfectly simple little task, my god what's wrong with you you loser.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd if someone had *noticed* and called me on it, I would have wanted to die (more than I already did).

She NEEDS to go back to her doctor, maybe even spend some time in hospital.  I'm so sorry you're both going through this, it's awful for both of you.", "YTA, mostly because calling her a child when you know this is caused by her depression is a dick move. Asking her to shower isn't, but escalating it with insults is not the way to go.\n\nDepression treated with only meds almost never works long-term. It should only really be done as a crutch for short-term issues or with therapy as the main treatment long-term. That's probably why she's so deep in it still that she can't get herself to shower, and on top of it has to deal with a boyfriend that calls her a child over it.\n\nI get it. Not showering IS gross, but telling her to up her meds and calling her a child is not gonna make her shower more often. Being compassionate towards her over something that she undoubtedly feels shame and guilt over, and maybe sitting down with her to research ways to help deal with depression symptoms is leagues better for a start.", "NTA I think some people mistake freedom for license. Your girlfriend sounds like one of them.\n\nYou can recognize that you have rights and freedoms, while having consideration for how your actions affect other people, taking that into consideration when you make your choices.\n\nLicense is thinking you have the right to act however you want with no need for consideration for other people and how your choices and actions affect others, while viewing any rejection of that as somehow disrespectful or unaccommodating.\n\nYour girlfriend technically has the right to not shower until her miasma causes eyes to water. She doesn't have the right to force others to be okay with it, with them doing whatever she wants them to, such as sharing a vehicle with her having to marinate in her stench for hours.", "NTA, hygiene matters. But as you said she has known mental health issues, so maybe try another tactic. Try asking her what the barriers to her showering are. Is it the effort? The time? Sensory issues (being wet/cold/too hot)? A dislike of being naked? I struggle with depression and my partner has a number of mental health issues plus autism so we are familiar with the difficulty in showering in this house. You need to move it from a moral/values issues (which is why she\u2019s defensive because being deemed \u201cdirty\u201d carries a lot of emotional baggage) to a logistics thing - how can we make it easier for her do self care? \n\nIn my partners case it turns out the layout of the bathroom and shower made things more difficult than it needed to be. They also worried about falling in the shower. We changed some things, got a shower stool and a hand held showehead, and it\u2019s much easier for them now. They also figured out a cleaning routine (wipes, wipes, baby) that works to keep acceptable hygiene when they just don\u2019t have the oomph to shower.

I\u2019ve never told her to \u201cup her meds.\u201d I\u2019ve said she needs to talk with her doctor because the current regime is clearly NOT effective at treating her depression, for a variety of reasons most of which are not mentioned in this post because they are irrelevant. \n\nThere is a HUGE difference between the two, and to pretend that is the only way we\u2019ve ever talked about it is reductive and not very helpful.

How dare you a) assume I haven\u2019t done all of those things you listed, or b) make it my responsibility to shoulder the burden.

The way I worded it was very black and white, but I'm not saying medication isn't a good tool. Using it with no other treatment whatsoever is just generally not an effective help for most people, especially with the amount of people suffering from treatment-resistant depression, and who have co-morbidities.", "I incorrectly assumed that talking about dosage meant upping her dosage, and that's my bad. I don't pretend that all you've ever done is talk to her about meds, it's just the only information in the post, and so I went off that. That's also why I didn't assume you've done other things, because the post doesn't mention any of them. It's not your responsibility AT ALL to shoulder any of this. I didn't say that. I was only commenting on you calling her a child and talking about meds dosages (which I made an incorrect assumption about), and suggesting another way to go.\n\nI don't think it's on you to deal with any of this, but you're on reddit asking whether you're the asshole. Based off of the post, I thought your reaction to her made you the asshole, because you can only glean so much from it. Your post asks if you're an asshole for insulting your girlfriend about her showering. I suggested being more compassionate about it. With more info, I honestly still think calling her a child was unnecessary, but I completely understand why you feel frustrated enough to do it. I don't think you \"just need to support her more\" or that you're not doing enough (you're clearly doing more than anyone should have to), for the record.\n\nIs any of this immense pressure and pain going to be eased by asking reddit about something that's clearly not the issue?

The depression needs to be dealt with.

No dirty washcloths and she\u2019s not buying products made for that (we live and grocery shop together). It\u2019s also not that\u2019s she\u2019s showering but not washing her hair every time, I completely understand the reasoning behind that. \n\nShe\u2019s just not cleaning at all unfortunately.", "I agree.  How can you sleep with her?", "I was thinking the same thing.", "I'm sorry, having to be reminded that grooming and hygiene are important parts of being an adult AND giving pushback the way the GF did IS childish. Full stop.\n\nI get depression is a helluva thing to live with. I spent most of my life struggling with intense grief due to family deaths when I was small, I understand that somedays you just don't want to shower. But I also would feel embarrassed if I could smell myself, and I'd be mortified when told by others that I needed to shower. GF knows better.", "She\u2019s not disgusting for being depressed but yeah, she\u2019s obviously disgusting for almost not showering at all. And her lack of seeking treatment as well as her treatment of her boyfriend are both highly self centered. Sometimes people need a reality check. She\u2019s not going to get better by being coddled and enabled.", "\ud83e\udd2f \ud83d\ude31  \ud83e\udd2f ......**P---Ewwwwwwwwwww    NTA**", "Then no,  you're NTA here.     She has a problem,  and you're trying to help her.  \n\nCould you be more gentle about it?    Oh sure,  probably.   But you're not trying to hurt her.     And she does need some help.  \n\nNTA.", "I had clinical depression for over 10 years and lemme tell you \u2018knowing better\u2019 doesn\u2019t make a difference. Gf doesn\u2019t \u2018need to be reminded\u2019, she can\u2019t make herself do what she knows she needs to do. Ofc she\u2019s embarrassed and ashamed\u2026 what\u2019s calling her a child gonna do about that? Op\u2019s burnt out and shouldn\u2019t have to be doing anything he\u2019s doing. Relationships like this are taxing on anyone, but that doesn\u2019t make insulting your SO any less mean.", "For me, it's the pushback she gave about OP asking her if she was going to shower and then telling her she really ought to. \n\nAlso I was diagnosed with Clinical depression as well. From the age of 12 until I was 26-27, my life was constantly shrouded in darkness and despair. I'm sympathetic to both OP and his GF. I had many relationships fail due to issues stemming from my grief. OP's GF is about to fall into that same cycle if she cannot handle being asked to maintain decent hygiene. \n\nI'm also not one to excuse shitty behavior on account of mental illness. It's an explanation, sure, but not an excuse. You can be depressed and still force yourself to do what needs to be done, even if the process of doing so feels crippling at the time. \n\nIt sounds like, according to OP, that his GF's depression is not being correctly managed. Which, let's be real, it isn't.", "Being able to force yourself I think is deffo an individual thing, but I don\u2019t disagree with what you\u2019re saying. The verdict for me is ESH if anything.", "It very well could be. And yeah, I think ESH is fair. Like OP was a jerk, but not wrong about it being childish. I think it comes down to what good it did (or rather didn't) do."]}
