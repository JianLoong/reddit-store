I can see where your girlfriend's coming from, but you're definitely NTA. \n\nI've had severe, chronic treatment resistant depression for decades.  I've been in a state where showering was virtually impossible, and I could only manage it every 4-5 days.  The first couple of days, I felt overwhelming relief that it had *only* been 48 hours since my last shower so it was ok.  After that, there was steadily increasing guilt and shame about how disgusting I was, until the tipping point was reached and I could make the stupendous mental effort necessary to shower.  Then shame and self loathing that I'd made such a fuss about a perfectly simple little task, my god what's wrong with you you loser.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nAnd if someone had *noticed* and called me on it, I would have wanted to die (more than I already did).

She NEEDS to go back to her doctor, maybe even spend some time in hospital.  I'm so sorry you're both going through this, it's awful for both of you.", "YTA, mostly because calling her a child when you know this is caused by her depression is a dick move. Asking her to shower isn't, but escalating it with insults is not the way to go.\n\nDepression treated with only meds almost never works long-term. It should only really be done as a crutch for short-term issues or with therapy as the main treatment long-term. That's probably why she's so deep in it still that she can't get herself to shower, and on top of it has to deal with a boyfriend that calls her a child over it.\n\nI get it. Not showering IS gross, but telling her to up her meds and calling her a child is not gonna make her shower more often. Being compassionate towards her over something that she undoubtedly feels shame and guilt over, and maybe sitting down with her to research ways to help deal with depression symptoms is leagues better for a start.", "NTA I think some people mistake freedom for license. Your girlfriend sounds like one of them.\n\nYou can recognize that you have rights and freedoms, while having consideration for how your actions affect other people, taking that into consideration when you make your choices.\n\nLicense is thinking you have the right to act however you want with no need for consideration for other people and how your choices and actions affect others, while viewing any rejection of that as somehow disrespectful or unaccommodating.\n\nYour girlfriend technically has the right to not shower until her miasma causes eyes to water. She doesn't have the right to force others to be okay with it, with them doing whatever she wants them to, such as sharing a vehicle with her having to marinate in her stench for hours.", "NTA, hygiene matters. But as you said she has known mental health issues, so maybe try another tactic. Try asking her what the barriers to her showering are. Is it the effort? The time? Sensory issues (being wet/cold/too hot)? A dislike of being naked? I struggle with depression and my partner has a number of mental health issues plus autism so we are familiar with the difficulty in showering in this house. You need to move it from a moral/values issues (which is why she\u2019s defensive because being deemed \u201cdirty\u201d carries a lot of emotional baggage) to a logistics thing - how can we make it easier for her do self care? \n\nIn my partners case it turns out the layout of the bathroom and shower made things more difficult than it needed to be. They also worried about falling in the shower. We changed some things, got a shower stool and a hand held showehead, and it\u2019s much easier for them now. They also figured out a cleaning routine (wipes, wipes, baby) that works to keep acceptable hygiene when they just don\u2019t have the oomph to shower.

I\u2019ve never told her to \u201cup her meds.\u201d I\u2019ve said she needs to talk with her doctor because the current regime is clearly NOT effective at treating her depression, for a variety of reasons most of which are not mentioned in this post because they are irrelevant. \n\nThere is a HUGE difference between the two, and to pretend that is the only way we\u2019ve ever talked about it is reductive and not very helpful. For the record I\u2019ve also suggested she talk with someone, repeatedly, even just one of the AI therapy-aid bots that had some decent clinical reviews, just anything at all instead of nothing. \n\nAlso, you probably need to source a claim like:\n\n>Depression treated with only meds almost never works long-term.\n\nFinally, I have a family history with depression, and I have suffered myself.

The way I worded it was very black and white, but I'm not saying medication isn't a good tool.

I don't pretend that all you've ever done is talk to her about meds, it's just the only information in the post, and so I went off that. That's also why I didn't assume you've done other things, because the post doesn't mention any of them. It's not your responsibility AT ALL to shoulder any of this. I didn't say that. I was only commenting on you calling her a child and talking about meds dosages (which I made an incorrect assumption about), and suggesting another way to go.\n\nI don't think it's on you to deal with any of this, but you're on reddit asking whether you're the asshole. Based off of the post, I thought your reaction to her made you the asshole, because you can only glean so much from it. Your post asks if you're an asshole for insulting your girlfriend about her showering. I suggested being more compassionate about it. With more info, I honestly still think calling her a child was unnecessary, but I completely understand why you feel frustrated enough to do it. I don't think you \"just need to support her more\" or that you're not doing enough (you're clearly doing more than anyone should have to), for the record.\n\nIs any of this immense pressure and pain going to be eased by asking reddit about something that's clearly not the issue?

How can you sleep with her?", "I was thinking the same thing.", "I'm sorry, having to be reminded that grooming and hygiene are important parts of being an adult AND giving pushback the way the GF did IS childish. Full stop.\n\nI get depression is a helluva thing to live with. I spent most of my life struggling with intense grief due to family deaths when I was small, I understand that somedays you just don't want to shower. But I also would feel embarrassed if I could smell myself, and I'd be mortified when told by others that I needed to shower. GF knows better.", "She\u2019s not disgusting for being depressed but yeah, she\u2019s obviously disgusting for almost not showering at all. And her lack of seeking treatment as well as her treatment of her boyfriend are both highly self centered. Sometimes people need a reality check. She\u2019s not going to get better by being coddled and enabled.", "\ud83e\udd2f \ud83d\ude31  \ud83e\udd2f ......**P---Ewwwwwwwwwww    NTA**", "Then no,  you're NTA here.

Ofc she\u2019s embarrassed and ashamed\u2026 what\u2019s calling her a child gonna do about that? Op\u2019s burnt out and shouldn\u2019t have to be doing anything he\u2019s doing. Relationships like this are taxing on anyone, but that doesn\u2019t make insulting your SO any less mean.", "For me, it's the pushback she gave about OP asking her if she was going to shower and then telling her she really ought to. \n\nAlso I was diagnosed with Clinical depression as well. From the age of 12 until I was 26-27, my life was constantly shrouded in darkness and despair. I'm sympathetic to both OP and his GF. I had many relationships fail due to issues stemming from my grief. OP's GF is about to fall into that same cycle if she cannot handle being asked to maintain decent hygiene. \n\nI'm also not one to excuse shitty behavior on account of mental illness. It's an explanation, sure, but not an excuse. You can be depressed and still force yourself to do what needs to be done, even if the process of doing so feels crippling at the time. \n\nIt sounds like, according to OP, that his GF's depression is not being correctly managed. Which, let's be real, it isn't.", "Being able to force yourself I think is deffo an individual thing, but I don\u2019t disagree with what you\u2019re saying. The verdict for me is ESH if anything.", "It very well could be. And yeah, I think ESH is fair. Like OP was a jerk, but not wrong about it being childish. I think it comes down to what good it did (or rather didn't) do.", "NTA and yes I understand she\u2019s depressed but you need to break up with her.  Her depression isn\u2019t your responsibility and everyone deserves a partner who showers.", "Nta and her poor hygiene is opening her up to other issues such as urinary and vaginal infections and skin conditions.  She gotta talk to the dr.", "Not caring for yourself literally causes depression. Try to frame it as something she should do for herself rather than to not stink for your sake. NTA tho, that's disgusting", " NTA for bringing up odor because hygiene has points. The more you have the same convo the less patience you can have. Mental health doesn't function rationally, it can be hard to relate to her responses or refusal. She probably doesn't fully understand why she doesn't want to either just that it feels like _too much_ when everything already does.\n\nI've been sad and gone a few days. But fortunately I'm not a smelly person and by day three I was usually just sitting in the bottom of the shower crying .\n\nI also found bubble baths relaxing but I'd be sad when I didn't have a tub. Do you have a tub? \n\nShowers are about efficiency, sometimes baths are about trying to relax. \n\n Is she eating? Is she brushing her teeth or hair? Is anything else declining?  If things are, her mental health may be getting much worse sadly. :( \n\nUnscented baby wipes in the meantime. Maybe some spray deodorant/ air spray. Sorry you are both going thru this.", "NTA\n\nI'm a neurodivergent adult and hygiene used to be a challenge for me when I masked more. Sensory challenges suck. I *wanted* to do the things, but the things were terrible to experience, and combined with white knuckling it with everything else something had to give.\n\nBut those things were my cross to bear, and I still owed it to myself, my spouse, my friends, and my colleagues to be clean and healthy. I can't say I enjoy the sensation of parts of these things, but I can do it all at normal intervals without a sensory meltdown now.\n\nYou are not an asshole for holding her accountable for this. In fact, telling her she smells when she smells is actually a kindness, even if it doesn't FEEL kind at the time. I suggest talking to her about the why and how it affects the people around her when she's calm. See how you can support her.", "ESH, but her more. Where you were in the wrong was going from 0-100 during the conversation. When she didn\u2019t get the hint when you asked her when she was gonna shower, you should have asked her why she wasn\u2019t going to or how she was feeling first. Then, you could\u2019ve brought up the fact that she commonly does this, you\u2019re concerned and frankly,she is starting to have an odor. I feel like you escalated way too fast and I could see why being called childish right off the bat would hurt her feelings. \n\nHowever, I get getting fed up, especially if you have mentioned her showering habits multiple times. I think the issue is less about her going long without showering and more about her actually stinking. You can prevent BO without actually getting into the shower. \n\nI\u2019d sit her down and apologize for coming across harsh, but explain firmly that her odor and lack of hygiene is affecting your relationship. I\u2019d tactfully emphasize the odor because maybe that\u2019ll clue her into how serious this issue is. Sometimes, people with hygiene problems genuinely don\u2019t realize they smell because they\u2019ve become nose blind. \n\nFinally, has she looked into ADHD or autism? Those conditions can cause executive dysfunction, which makes it very difficult to complete day to day tasks that people who don\u2019t have that condition do without thinking. \n\nEither way though, if  this issue doesn\u2019t change, you might have to consider whether you\u2019re ok with staying with her as she is.", "NTA . I have been severely depressed in the past and I managed to shower or bath at least twice a week. I feel like if someone points it more than once should be a big hint that she needs to do better especially if you have a so.", "NTA. She's not taking you into consideration at all, there is absolutely such a thing as being too comfortable in a relationship. She's lucky you have the heart to tell her and haven't given up. Good on you.", "Nta. It\u2019s important and she would probably be very embarrassed and hurt by a person smelling her at an event.\n\nAs someone who struggled with depression myself, there\u2019s some things I did to help myself.\n1. The little disposable toothbrushes. They\u2019re not great for the environment but when I couldn\u2019t get out of bed they helped me maintain some dental hygiene.\n2. Bidet attachment to toilet. Great especially for women because of post sex pees and periods. If you spring extra you get one with warm water hook up.\n3. I discovered, because I have big curly hair, showers were hard because the idea of being cold for hours after was unpleasant. A big fluffy robe, a shower cap (just because you shower doesn\u2019t mean you have to wash your hair) helped a lot. \n4. when I do wash my hair I have a special microfiber hair cap for letting it dry so I don\u2019t feel cold.\n5. Taking showers together as a couple helpers for some reason. Accountability? Not sure.\n\nObviously you should do your best to be gentle but you are only human and patience is a limited commodity. There\u2019s probably parts of showers that seem like SO much work to her. Maybe it\u2019s being tired (you can sit down!) maybe it\u2019s the cold part coming out (you can get a fluffy bath mat), the lights bother you (shower in the dark) etc. if you can help figure out one thing about it that would make it easier, maybe it could help. Best of luck- depression sucks.", "Is your current gf my ex? Because this is an actual fight we would have, up to and including twisting my words (acting like vs being a child) and her being vehemently against mental health maintenance.

One does it because one cares. \nAnd this reminds me i was supposed to shower today, but again my day got to busy and it slipped out of my min. Of to actually showering \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nLook, let me be level with you. No matter how much you care about someone, that'll never magically teach them to care about themselves. They have to choose to care. In your case, your girlfriend is receiving treatment for depression and knows that her not taking a shower is a bad thing. She's consciously choosing not to shower. If she's not taking basic care of herself, then it's a red flag sign that her depression is taking control of her life.\n\nShe's not responsible for having her condition- but she is responsible for managing it. Right now, she's failing and needs more help than she's getting and you can provide.\n\nYou've really got to think about this situation. Is she stable or is this the one issue you haven't let be swept under the rug or dismissed? Is she treating you like a partner and a human should be treated? Either way, you need to have a serious talk with her because she's just going to continue not taking a shower unless something is done about it.\n\nMaybe consider making plans with family and staying with them for one or two days on a visit to get your head on straight. Take a chance to clear your head away from the situation and see the difference between how you feel with your GF and away from your GF. I don't mean that as encouraging you to break up. I mean that as comparing the situation.", "From what I read here, you asked her whether she was going to shower and \"kinda lost it\" when she said she wasn't. The NTAs here seem to be missing this escalation, or are just judging her for being \"gross.\" \n\nYou could have spoken to her respectfully and let her know it was serious without getting angry. If you're young and in a fairly new relationship, you might not have developed those skills yet, but they're absolutely essential for a healthy relationship. Especially with a depressive. \n\nI have been with my husband, who has MDD, for almost 3 decades. If you don't learn how to deal with things like this better, you're both going to make each other miserable. \n\nYour girlfriend isn't your enemy, her depression is an enemy you need to fight together.", "This is the best response in here. As a person with depression that has sometimes been this bad, I 100% agree.
