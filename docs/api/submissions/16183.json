They can\u2019t ask for pain meds without getting accused of being an addict. They can\u2019t seek help for dark thoughts without being treated like a child.\n\nIt\u2019s sad women need to have a male figure in a room with them so they aren\u2019t ignored or talked over. And you are a witness so your voice should be heard in any complaint. \n\nAnd her sister is just plain wrong. Letting doctors get away with things like this only makes things worse.\n\nThanks for being her advocate.", "NTA\n\nit's a well known fact that doctors dismiss and belittle pain and other medical problems women suffer.

I would be pissed too if anyone did that to my partner.\n\nAlso, the doctor's comment about c-sections is straight up wrong. Does he think they just give women Tylenol for that? So he's an asshole for ignoring your wife's pain and insulting her afterward.\n\nYour girlfriend's sister is also an asshole. You never demanded opioids, just that her pain be acknowledged. As for speaking to a doctor that isn't your own, you actually do have a right, if the person who you are speaking on behalf of lets you.

No one wants a Dr House wannabe in real life.", "NTA. Thank you for stepping up.\nTo put a IUD into a uterus can be done with a local anesthetica (injection into the cervix). So to put someone through that pain deliberately is just disgusting. And that sister, well. She needs to stay out of this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your GF when the doctor was belittling her. He was the kind of AH too many of us have had experience with.  Having an advocate with you during a medical procedure can be very helpful, as well as reducing the fear factor.\n\nIgnore the sister. She's biased on a different side.\n\nedit: Maybe, though, next time keep it clean, don't yell, don't call him a prick. It hurts your credibility if you do file a formal complaint. Stay in adult mode.

Good job standing up for your partner in the face of some power tripping, ego driven, sexist jerk.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you for sticking up for your girlfriend! She\u2019s lucky to have you! Doctors need to STFU and listen to their patients when they say they\u2019re in pain. And GF\u2019s sister sounds like she needs to do the same as well. Nobody in the medical field should be telling their patients how they feel or how they are supposed to respond to pain. I tried for an IUD after my first son was born and honestly, the pain was more intense than when I had him. I opted to not get one. The unfortunate reality is women are just expected to deal with these things because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u201d.

You get pain meds stronger than Tylenol when you give birth.  So there\u2019s that. Just because child birth is painful doesn\u2019t mean women should endure other  pain. It\u2019s misogynistic bullshit.  Par for the course for women. Be belittled by male doctors.", "Some people say IUD pain is similar to and as bad as childbirth pain.

Good boyfriend I have had an IUD and it is a massive thing that they do not numb the area before insertion ! They are literally making holes and putting a permeant piece of plastic in your cervix !", "INFO: What were you expecting the doctor to do? Stop the procedure? No doc would give pain meds higher than advil/Tylenol for an IUD insertion. Yes, it can be painful, but there's no way to place it differently that would make it hurt less.

If you can, leave a review. \n\nYour gf sister, however, is being an A H. Just because she works in the medical profession doesn\u2019t mean she was in the room. While doctors might know a lot - if you don\u2019t have a uterus, you can only imagine pain, not understand or experience it \u2014 so he has absolutely zero baseline for how to tell a patient to deal with it or even how to compare it. Not only that, but not everyone\u2019s uterus is the same \u2014 he could have cut something or even inserted incorrectly, which can cause damage or even infection. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had a baby via C-section and an IUD and I can confirm it\u2019s simply incomparable. He was a A H for that and it\u2019s amazing you advocated for your girlfriend\u2026 you\u2019re going to be amazing partner in the delivery room when you both decide to have kids", "NTA - My hubby would have done the same and he's a Rock Star and so are you", "I think you did the right thing.  NTA\n\nComparing the pain you GF is dealing with a C Section is  so inappropriate, in my mind.\n\nPain is personal.  Individuals have a different tolerance for pain.  Tolerating pain well is NOT something that needs \"practiced.\"\n\nMany of these same docs who dismiss a woman's pain are the same people who whine when they have  cold.", "NTA. But\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, that is how women are treated by modern medicine. When I got my IUD seven years ago, I was given NOTHING to for the pain and was sent on my merry way the second it was in. I couldn\u2019t stand up properly for two weeks, and when I tried to get something from the pain my doctor said \u201cit\u2019ll pass, this is nothing\u201d. A friend of mine who got hers recently actually fainted and was told the same thing. Women\u2019s pain isn\u2019t taken seriously.", "NTA, IUDs are a pain of a level that\u2019s not even a joke!!!! I have cried twice when I got it and I was so appreciative of my doctor who let me drop F bombs and just lose my lung air over it!  \nGood on you for advocating but May be no name calling would be more effective. \nMy doctor had discussed pain management plan with me and discussed the extent of support she could provide me. \n\nThere is a lot of documented research on lack of accountability of advocacy for females and specially WoC. The sister is biased and also everyone\u2019s pain tolerance is difference. If ut hurts for your partner it does! Sister wouldn\u2019t know!", "NTA. Also would like to point out that your gf\u2019s sister is part of the problem if she\u2019s blaming her sister for not \u201cshutting up about the pain\u201d", "I didn't read it. NTA doctors are very good at gaslighting patients with uteruses.", "NTA thanks for standing up for your girlfriend! You did right my dude!", "NTA. \n\nyour girlfriend was looking at you for help with tears in her eyes and his job is to help his patients, which he refused to do. they have a pain scale in the hospital for a reason and he just told her to toughen up and get over it. what did we come to the hospital for?? you probably could\u2019ve not snapped at him but my husband would\u2019ve done the same thing you did. i suggest never seeing that doctor again.", "Not on the subject discussed, but if you want children with your current GF, you really should not wait 15 years from now. It\u2019s possible everything turns fine, but you would be taking a huge risk waiting until 38 years. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind and are willing to take the risk not to have children, ok. But I see enough friends with infertility problems that thought they could wait and regret not starting earlier.", "NTA. Your AH SIL needs to mind her own business.", "That doctor is an asshole and should have his license revoked. You did well to stand up for your wife. Definitely change doctors and if you can leave a negative review somewhere do so. NTA", "NTA I went for IUD placement and got to know my cervix is so small/shut that the IUD won't go in without me being in severe pain. The doctor tried twice on two separate days and I cried a lot on both days. So I know how much it pains getting an IUD even when I was not able to go through with it coz of the pain. The doctor was absolutely rude to say things like that and ignore your GF's pain. Don't let her sister keep u from standing up for your GF even in future.", "NTA\n\nDoctors do this to women a tonne. Thank you for sticking up for her and believing her.", "NTA search this procedure on tiktok and you'll see many OBGYN Dr's who think what your girlfriend went through is barbaric. Your SIL is misogynistic in her care as well.", "NTA. When I got my IUD put in it hurt so bad that I straight up fainted. It\u2019s very painful, and that specific kind of pain is something (along with childbirth/a c-section) that this male doctor will never experience or understand. He was being a huge asshole. All you did was stand up for your girlfriend which is *exactly what she wanted you to do*. She was right to bring you along, it\u2019s pretty common that doctors ignore/minimize women\u2019s pain and won\u2019t listen to us.", "HUGE NTA.  You're a top notch guy for supporting your gf through that.\n\nI was under a full anesthetic when i had my IUD put in but had to get the strings snipped on the table a few weeks later.  That alone fucking killed.  That Dr sounds like an incompassionate fuck.", "NTA. Doctors tend to dismiss the pain of women and what he said was unacceptable. That was a good boyfriend move.", "NTA student nurse here, I\u2019m used to arrogant belittling doctors but your SIL is a surprise, we\u2019re taught that pain is one of the first things you can successfully deal with. No patient should have to deal with unnecessary pain. \n\nYou should have kicked the Dr in the balls and told him to toughen up.", "NTA. The sister definitely is though as well as the doctor. Good job standing up for her.", "NTA there is a university where I live where they are looking into why women are booking or turning up for Pap smears and some of the preliminary findings indicate it\u2019s because of traumatic experiences with IUD insertion. I had a terrible experience with mine and would not do it again without someone else present and strong painkillers.", "NTA, no pain meds is very common, women routinely get ignored for all kinds of pain, and are rarely given more than tylenol or Ibuprophen for IUD's even though they can be excruciating. Your girlfriends sister is a massive asshole that she is enforcing the drug seeking stereotypes that cause far more harm than good.", "All this and it's even worse for WOC", "And JFC. I had a c section.  *FOR WHICH I WAS DRUGGED.  Before, during and after. \n\nIUD pain is completely different. Especially if you aren\u2019t drugged.", "And it gets even worse if you're fat, disabled, and black or brown. \n\nI started getting taken more seriously only after I started bringing my husband to appointments. \n\nNTA, OP. Not remotely.", "I had this issue. My iud had perforated my uterus and it took 7 months to fund out what was on. All it took to find the issue was an cray.\nGood on you for looking after your girlfriend", "In the UK they tell you to take pain killers half an hour to an hour before having an IUD inserted to help with the pain. Taking pain killers then going straight in isn't going to help.", "Big pharma improperly using shonky research was the basis for the opioid crisis", "They can hurt but there are degrees of pain. They tried to fit mine for 30mins with gas but not happening so did under GA. I was shaking after first appointment with cramps for three days. After second, I had bruises on thigh where I could see the actual fingerprints of consultant. Not every patient is the same and anatomy varies by woman which can make a huge difference. In my case, warranted because next step hysterectomy but don't tell me that is a pain level I need to get over.", "I was so goddamn furious after I had mine done the first time. They did straight up lie to my face and tell me it would be like a \u201cpinch\u201d or a \u201ccramp\u201d. No it was like someone stabbing me with a knitting needle and was the most intense pain I had ever experienced. I screamed and swore and nearly fainted. Before the procedure I asked if I could walk home since I only lived a few blocks away and they said yes so I had no one to pick me up. I limped out of there shaking and holding my gut like I\u2019d been shot. This guy rules for yelling at the doctor.", "Second pregnancy I complained over and over to multiple doctors that I was wayyyyyyy too tired and sleeping like 16 hrs a day. They all dismissed me saying it was normal pregnancy symptoms (tired, yes, sleeping 16 hrs a day, no). Second trimester came and went, still tired, still dismissed, even if that fatigue is usually gone by then. Third trimester I was like holy shit, please look into this!!!!! One doctor finally listened (Where I live prenatal care is done at a maternity clinic with whatever doctor is on call that day) and did some bloodwork and realized they never tested my iron in the initial test, it came back at 4....5 iron IV transfusions later I was a ball of energy again!!!", "Baby #4; my son hadn\u2019t dropped fully, I was almost 2 weeks past my due date, my water broke the night before and I had an epidural. I told the nurse I had to poop. She told me that because I had the epidural in that I couldn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything and if I did it was probably the baby moving. When she left the room I had my then husband get a bedpan out of the storage cabinet. I pooped. She came back in and asked what was going on. I told her \u201cI said I had to poop. You didn\u2019t believe me\u201d.", "My sister have done both and said that the C-section was a walk in the park compared with the IUD.", "Same in Canada, they make sure you have them in your system and active before inserting it. Getting Tylenol and putting the IUD in right after is the same as going without pain meds as they take a while to be at their peak performance in your system.", "Add to that, that when men can shove babies out of them, regardless of method, they can have an opinion on the pain involved too.", "I got so much shit from one nurse because my OB prescribed me low dose norco after my tear \ud83d\ude44", "I am child free and *tried* getting an IUD placed.  It was horrible, painful andy cervix said \"nope\" with the measurement device.....the doc couldn't even get that in. \n\nSo since I didn't want any kids anyway, I had my tubes removed.", "Yup. My totally successful insertion hurt so much that I fainted. My body straight up went \u201cnope, this is too much. Shut it down.\u201d For comparison, I *didn\u2019t* pass out when I snapped my tibia into three pieces."]}
