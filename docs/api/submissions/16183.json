They can\u2019t ask for pain meds without getting accused of being an addict. They can\u2019t seek help for dark thoughts without being treated like a child.\n\nIt\u2019s sad women need to have a male figure in a room with them so they aren\u2019t ignored or talked over. And you are a witness so your voice should be heard in any complaint. \n\nAnd her sister is just plain wrong. Letting doctors get away with things like this only makes things worse.\n\nThanks for being her advocate.", "NTA\n\nit's a well known fact that doctors dismiss and belittle pain and other medical problems women suffer.

I would be pissed too if anyone did that to my partner.\n\nAlso, the doctor's comment about c-sections is straight up wrong. Does he think they just give women Tylenol for that? So he's an asshole for ignoring your wife's pain and insulting her afterward.\n\nYour girlfriend's sister is also an asshole. You never demanded opioids, just that her pain be acknowledged. As for speaking to a doctor that isn't your own, you actually do have a right, if the person who you are speaking on behalf of lets you.

No one wants a Dr House wannabe in real life.", "NTA. Thank you for stepping up.\nTo put a IUD into a uterus can be done with a local anesthetica (injection into the cervix). So to put someone through that pain deliberately is just disgusting. And that sister, well. She needs to stay out of this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your GF when the doctor was belittling her. He was the kind of AH too many of us have had experience with.  Having an advocate with you during a medical procedure can be very helpful, as well as reducing the fear factor.\n\nIgnore the sister. She's biased on a different side.\n\nedit: Maybe, though, next time keep it clean, don't yell, don't call him a prick. It hurts your credibility if you do file a formal complaint. Stay in adult mode.

Good job standing up for your partner in the face of some power tripping, ego driven, sexist jerk.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you for sticking up for your girlfriend! She\u2019s lucky to have you! Doctors need to STFU and listen to their patients when they say they\u2019re in pain. And GF\u2019s sister sounds like she needs to do the same as well. Nobody in the medical field should be telling their patients how they feel or how they are supposed to respond to pain. I tried for an IUD after my first son was born and honestly, the pain was more intense than when I had him. I opted to not get one. The unfortunate reality is women are just expected to deal with these things because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u201d.

There's WAY too many doctors that are dismissing their patient's pain and wind up causing more problems down the road.

You get pain meds stronger than Tylenol when you give birth.  So there\u2019s that. Just because child birth is painful doesn\u2019t mean women should endure other  pain. It\u2019s misogynistic bullshit.  Par for the course for women. Be belittled by male doctors.", "Some people say IUD pain is similar to and as bad as childbirth pain.

Good boyfriend I have had an IUD and it is a massive thing that they do not numb the area before insertion ! They are literally making holes and putting a permeant piece of plastic in your cervix !", "INFO: What were you expecting the doctor to do? Stop the procedure? No doc would give pain meds higher than advil/Tylenol for an IUD insertion. Yes, it can be painful, but there's no way to place it differently that would make it hurt less.

He was even more annoyed when he came back and I wasn't magically better, and when the nurse noted my temperature had risen alarmingly, he barked out \"Fine, I guess we'll get her the CT she wanted\".\n\nThe first thing I got from him after the CT was a lecture that I should've told him my pain was a 10. \"Everyone with a ruptured appendix said 10, and what kind of game are you playing? Why didn't you take the pain meds?\" I did have tears at this point, but they were pain, not emotion, and I clenched my teeth when I answered \"because you people never believe me and if I don't stay lucid, you'll let me die.\"\n\nThe \"emergency\" surgery occurred 6 hours after the ambulance brought me in, and took 2-3 extra hours due to the rupture.\n\nIt was neither the first nor the last time that I had to use everything I had in me to grind through the pain to make sure they found and fixed the problem, rather than juicing me up with pain killers and sending me home without answers.\n\nYour GF can probably tell you many stories like this, as can just about every woman.

Doctors will push and push women to use IUD or implant as a \"reliable birth control\" method, extolling their virtues and making you feel unreasonable and irresponsible if you hold off and say you are fine to continue with barrier methods. Then those same doctors will at best ignore your requests for pain relief during the process of putting them in, at worst mock you (as per OP's girlfriend) no matter how much you cry or tense up or yell. And you will be expected to hold still while it's done. I have never met anyone who was given proper pain relief for IUD insertion, hit and miss for the implant, but they wouldn't consider asking a bloke to undergo a scalpel free vasectomy without at least a local. Hell, my husband got a local anaesthetic for having a couple of stitches put in his thumb when he cut it on a glass, but when I got stabbed deep in the leg with a fork (cutlery, not gardening tool) they removed it and stitched it up with nothing but sympathy and a BP monitor to make sure I was unlikely to faint.

He only agreed to test whatever it is needed to be tested when I asked him if he would bet his career on it. \n\nYep, induced an hour later because shocker, I knew I wasn't peeing myself. Whole thing was a shit show start to finish, and my poor child had to be on antibiotics the first hours of his life because I spiked a fever.", "Your whole point was that under normal circumstances she wouldn't have been in so much pain. Your assessment of the situation was that if an IUD is placed correctly, then it shouldn't hurt that bad and pain killers or a heating pad should be enough. To which I responded that just because you personally were able to tolerate the pain doesn't mean that others are. I have a very high pain tolerance but I know people that don't and I don't go around saying because I personally don't experience pain the way they do, that they are whiny or dramatic or that they needing stronger pain killers is them being weak. If she is in pain doesn't mean she needs to see a doctor, it means her doctor should have fucking listened and given her what she asked for.", "You think giving one single dose of a pain medication is going to make them an addict?

I knew I was done having kids after my second (my kids are 17 and 14). Well I had a rectocele and a cystocele, so I had a hysterectomy at the same time. They kept my ovaries and my cervix. The cervix mostly because that is what the mesh is anchored to. But not having a period for the last year has been incredibly amazing. And the doctor's office I go to will just do an elective hysterectomy. They gave my a \"q ball\" afterward. It's a tiny hose that goes inside to where they did the work and puts lidocaine there for 3 to 5 days. I had such an easy recovery. It was so lovely.", "I have a world class team.

Good on you for advocating for your GF.", "Especially when it comes to \"routine\" procedures like gyno visits and IUD insertion. \n\nI have an IUD. From beginning to end, the process is *excruciating*. For those that don't know, they use a cold, metal instrument called a speculum to *pry open* your cervix). While the speculum is propping you open (and also *digging* into the skin of your cervix, they then use another cold, rigid metal instrument to measure your uterus, which involves them shoving that thing in deeper and deeper until it hits the outer wall of your uterine cavity. Then they take *another* long metal instrument which they use to insert the IUD, adjust it, and wedge it into place. \n\nAll that with barely any lubrication, no painkillers offerred unless *insisted* upon by the patient (not even tylenol or Advil), and no local anesthetic.  \n\nI was told to expect some \"minor discomfort\" during the procedure itself, and mild cramping afterwards. I generally have a decently high pain tolerance so I felt pretty confident I'd be fine. \n\nWhat I actually got, however, was agony so excruciating that I was whimpering and crying, and cramps so severe I was incapacitated for the rest of the day and *still* in severe levels of pain for the next two days, even *with* the highest safe dose of Advil.", "It is a well known fact that Reddit is full of kids who are happy to generalize an entire group of people based on what they\u2019ve read on the internet", "It really depends.

I literally was like 'that's it?' (granted, they had partially numbed me, but I had expected far worse as I have a low pain tolerance and I had heard horror stories). \n\nI definitely think it's worth the risk if one has issues with their periods. Just be prepared for there  to be a chance that you could be one of the ones for which it is very, very painful. \n\n I went from having periods that were extremely heavy (and bc didn't help that much, and I hated the side effects) to having no periods at all (which occurs in a lot of people who get an IUD).", "THIS THIS and the comment below - encourage her to switch to a woman gyno (or at least a different one) and get it checked. Local anesthesia IS ALWAYS an option for IUD and if a doctor won't give it, they shouldn't be the ones doing the proceedure. \n\nI've had a lot of success finding better gyno's with the google listings that include the pride flag - Queer & Kink friendly gynos seem to be better tuned towards listening to the patients even if you are not a part of those communities.

Harvested a bit for a biopsy and sent me home. I was a bit scared and pressured her into telling me what she had seen. She didn't want to at first but ended up saying she saw some lesions that didn't look good, but we should wait for the biopsy results. \n\nI spent the next month feeling very small and scared (I had recently learned my soon-to-be-X had cheated on me, so I could have caught something nasty). When the results came I locked myself in the bathroom to read the report, while mentally saying \"please, not HPV, please, not HPV!\". But everything seemed ok, to my layperson's eyes.\n\nWhen I returned to another ObGyn appointment, she read the report and smiled. Turns out the scary looking \"something\" was most likely scar tissue left by the IUD when it had attached itself to the uterine wall."]}
