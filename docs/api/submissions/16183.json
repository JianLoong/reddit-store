They can\u2019t ask for pain meds without getting accused of being an addict. They can\u2019t seek help for dark thoughts without being treated like a child.\n\nIt\u2019s sad women need to have a male figure in a room with them so they aren\u2019t ignored or talked over. And you are a witness so your voice should be heard in any complaint. \n\nAnd her sister is just plain wrong. Letting doctors get away with things like this only makes things worse.\n\nThanks for being her advocate.", "NTA\n\nit's a well known fact that doctors dismiss and belittle pain and other medical problems women suffer.

I would be pissed too if anyone did that to my partner.\n\nAlso, the doctor's comment about c-sections is straight up wrong. Does he think they just give women Tylenol for that? So he's an asshole for ignoring your wife's pain and insulting her afterward.\n\nYour girlfriend's sister is also an asshole. You never demanded opioids, just that her pain be acknowledged. As for speaking to a doctor that isn't your own, you actually do have a right, if the person who you are speaking on behalf of lets you.

No one wants a Dr House wannabe in real life.", "NTA. Thank you for stepping up.\nTo put a IUD into a uterus can be done with a local anesthetica (injection into the cervix). So to put someone through that pain deliberately is just disgusting. And that sister, well. She needs to stay out of this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your GF when the doctor was belittling her. He was the kind of AH too many of us have had experience with.  Having an advocate with you during a medical procedure can be very helpful, as well as reducing the fear factor.\n\nIgnore the sister. She's biased on a different side.\n\nedit: Maybe, though, next time keep it clean, don't yell, don't call him a prick. It hurts your credibility if you do file a formal complaint. Stay in adult mode.

Good job standing up for your partner in the face of some power tripping, ego driven, sexist jerk.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you for sticking up for your girlfriend! She\u2019s lucky to have you! Doctors need to STFU and listen to their patients when they say they\u2019re in pain. And GF\u2019s sister sounds like she needs to do the same as well. Nobody in the medical field should be telling their patients how they feel or how they are supposed to respond to pain. I tried for an IUD after my first son was born and honestly, the pain was more intense than when I had him. I opted to not get one. The unfortunate reality is women are just expected to deal with these things because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u201d.

There's WAY too many doctors that are dismissing their patient's pain and wind up causing more problems down the road.

You get pain meds stronger than Tylenol when you give birth.  So there\u2019s that. Just because child birth is painful doesn\u2019t mean women should endure other  pain. It\u2019s misogynistic bullshit.  Par for the course for women. Be belittled by male doctors.", "Some people say IUD pain is similar to and as bad as childbirth pain.

Good boyfriend I have had an IUD and it is a massive thing that they do not numb the area before insertion ! They are literally making holes and putting a permeant piece of plastic in your cervix !", "INFO: What were you expecting the doctor to do? Stop the procedure? No doc would give pain meds higher than advil/Tylenol for an IUD insertion. Yes, it can be painful, but there's no way to place it differently that would make it hurt less.

He was even more annoyed when he came back and I wasn't magically better, and when the nurse noted my temperature had risen alarmingly, he barked out \"Fine, I guess we'll get her the CT she wanted\".\n\nThe first thing I got from him after the CT was a lecture that I should've told him my pain was a 10. \"Everyone with a ruptured appendix said 10, and what kind of game are you playing? Why didn't you take the pain meds?\" I did have tears at this point, but they were pain, not emotion, and I clenched my teeth when I answered \"because you people never believe me and if I don't stay lucid, you'll let me die.\"\n\nThe \"emergency\" surgery occurred 6 hours after the ambulance brought me in, and took 2-3 extra hours due to the rupture.\n\nIt was neither the first nor the last time that I had to use everything I had in me to grind through the pain to make sure they found and fixed the problem, rather than juicing me up with pain killers and sending me home without answers.\n\nYour GF can probably tell you many stories like this, as can just about every woman.

Now she knows she can trust you in other situations, like when it's time to have children. Doctors often ignore what the woman wants in those situations so having an advocate is really important!\n\nShe also needs a new doctor. That guy sounds awful!", "Hell, I once asked specifically for diagnostic tests to sort out the *source* of my pain and promptly got accused of \"drug-seeking\". Like...what, ultrasounds are the new drug?", "I wouldn\u2019t trust the sister as a nurse tbh\u2026", "right like \u201cpeople complaining about pain is the reason there\u2019s an opioid crisis\u201d like actually the doctor is supposed to be a place where you can freely express your concerns\u2026 plus many people get hooked on opioids because it\u2019s the only thing that helps their pain, because the medical system fails them.", "EXACTLY!!", "NTA btw!", "It doesn't help anyway. I'm in the UK and learnt from the horror of the first two IUDs, so I went in pre-codeined for my 3rd and I still nearly passed out after half an hour of them messing around. My other half had to come in and get me because I could hardly walk and had blood everywhere. I've had an ectopic pregnancy and the pain was similar.", "This is exactly why I won't go alone to any medical appointment anymore. They claim they are happy to have a nurse be present as a 'chaperone' if you are uncomfortable being alone but from experience you are then just outnumbered and have even less say. It gives you zero ability to make a complaint either. Nurses aren't going to criticize a doctor.\n\nIts discouraging that so many doctors, nurses and admin staff have these horrible personal opinions about patients. Thats why the problems keep happening.", "Exactly! And even if he was offering only over the counter pain medication, he should have instructed her to take them an hour or two before the procedure so they have time to work, instead of giving her a tylenol pill on the spot. It is insane how normalized minimizing women's pain is.", "Oh god yes! I had the worst experience with an IUD when I was 22. First off, it was incredibly painful and bled like crazy. It had rejected after a few months but not enough to fall out, just enough to allow me to get pregnant. When I realized I was pregnant I went back to the Dr and they removed the IUD and then I miscarried a few weeks later. I went back on the pill and tried a myriad of birth control methods before having my tubes tied at 25.", "I spent the night after my insertion vomiting from the pain.", "There\u2019s a reason pain meds are used during childbirth, assuming the patient wants them.", "You poor girl xxx", "Agreed. My hubby was with me when I got mine. He promised to get snipped before I went thru it again. I ended up being the 3% rejection where it removes itself. That was also terrible.", "Thank you, kind stranger \u2764\ufe0f it all happened years ago though and I\u2019m completely recovered now.", "Mine removed itself twice. The midwife doing the procedure said she had never seen that happen before. I had to lay down in a dark room afterwards for like 20 minutes because I would have passed out if I tried to go home \ud83d\ude02", "Thank god you've recovered, you poor love xx"]}
