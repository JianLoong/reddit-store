You might not realize it yet but you just witnessed how women are treated by a lot of doctors. Women can\u2019t express pain or discomfort because they\u2019re \u201cexaggerating\u201d. They can\u2019t ask for pain meds without getting accused of being an addict. They can\u2019t seek help for dark thoughts without being treated like a child.\n\nIt\u2019s sad women need to have a male figure in a room with them so they aren\u2019t ignored or talked over. And you are a witness so your voice should be heard in any complaint. \n\nAnd her sister is just plain wrong. Letting doctors get away with things like this only makes things worse.\n\nThanks for being her advocate.", "NTA\n\nit's a well known fact that doctors dismiss and belittle pain and other medical problems women suffer. You stood up for your GF as you should.", "The doctor is TA. If your patient is crying with tears streaming down their face because of the pain, the response is definitely NOT \"tough it up\". \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Really NTA. IUD's can really hurt. Plus, when you're having a baby, your body spends months getting itself ready. \n\nMy advice is for your girlfriend to find a new gyno. \n\nI lived with idiopathic dysmenorrhea for almost 20 years before I found a gyno that sympathized enough to justify a hysterectomy. \n\nAnd pain isn't the reason for the opioid epidemic, improper use is the reason. Your girlfriend would probably have been fine with a single valium plus the Tylenol.", "NTA. I think the fact that your GF wanted you in the room at all is a huge red flag. And then when the Doctor spoke to you and not her? WOW. She needs to change doctors.", "NTA\n\nbeing a doctor doesn\u2019t mean you are automatically a good person or even an understanding one. \n\ngood job for standing up for your partner. i would want mine to do the same.", "Uuuuuugh your gf's sister is so freaking wrong here. Doctors belittle and ignore women when speaking about pain all the goddamn time and I'm sick of it. It's even worse when other women uphold this bullshit.\n\nNTA", "NTA there is a massive issue with healthcare professionals minimizing and ignoring women's pain. \n\nYes there are people dying because of opium but there are also women dying because their doctors are ignoring her. The fact that your girlfriend wanted you to be there so that she would be listened to speaks volumes.\n\nThat being said, never tell someone you're gonna report them. Just do it and don't give them any time to prepare.", "NTA and thank you for advocating for her. I don't have one of those, but I have heard they do hurt, so I'm sure they Dr may be used to it?  However, what he says and how he said it was unnecessary. Curious how he would know what a c section feels like.", "NTA, dude sounds like a major dick. My wife was in so much pain when she got hers that they stopped and gave her meds to soften her cervix. She said it was one of the worst pains she has felt. This was a few months after having a c section mind you.", "NTA, in any way. The doctor was insulting your wife and assuming he knew more about your wife's pain than she did. I would be pissed too if anyone did that to my partner.\n\nAlso, the doctor's comment about c-sections is straight up wrong. Does he think they just give women Tylenol for that? So he's an asshole for ignoring your wife's pain and insulting her afterward.\n\nYour girlfriend's sister is also an asshole. You never demanded opioids, just that her pain be acknowledged. As for speaking to a doctor that isn't your own, you actually do have a right, if the person who you are speaking on behalf of lets you. My fianc\u00e9 has her mother go to most of the appointments with her (I will be doing so as soon as we live together) because she gets brain fog and can struggle to explain her symptoms to a doctor. None of her doctors care that she has someone with her to help her communicate what she needs to. So yeah, your gf's sister is wrong about everything she said here.", "He was an AH. No. That is not how you deal with that. I have had both an IUD and C-section. And neither are really walk in the park. NTA. You should find a different doctor.", "NTA And tell the sister that for a nurse, she's really fucking ignorant.", "NTA \n\nImagine a red hot poker being thrust up your d*ick. That's what it feels like. Apparently her sister is in the wrong vocation. I'm a nurse and can't imagine treating anyone's pain like that doctor and your gf's sister.\n\nYou did good. You advocated for your gf. I hope she's okay now. Tell her she needs to get a new gyn right away.", "IUD insertions are very painful for some women. I wasn\u2019t able to finish the procedure it was so painful afterwards. Too many doctors ignore women\u2019s pain. You were right and so was she. The cause of the opioid crises is organized crime. I\u2019m sorry this happened. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your gf\u2019s sister is probably in the habit of ignoring patients and flexing her power over them like the doctor. She was likely offended because she\u2019s said similar things to patients and when she heard what you said, it felt like an attack on her personally. \n\nSide note, as someone in recovery w substance use disorder and mental illnesses that have caused me to be sent to psych wards, I\u2019ve been traumatized and treated like absolute shit by so many nurses that last year I refused to go to the ER until I was septic and had to be carried in by my husband.

How would they know how C-sections feel?\n\nI had to have a few uterus biopsies many years ago. The biopsies were hideously painful, but the male doctors told me it was \"just a pinch.\"", "NTA. Your girlfriend asked you to be there, and you did the right thing by being there. Your girlfriend asked you to advocate for her, and you did. Your girlfriend needed support, and again you were there for her. Where was her sister? Don\u2019t listen to her idiot sister, doctors are not another godly race and yes, there are nasty jerks who are also doctors.  It\u2019s good that you reported the doctor, better if you get a survey about the visit. Now, never go back to that doctor and find a better one going forward.", "NTA. The doctor could've just firmly said no and left it at that. His comment about c-section is completely uncalled for. His arrogance and lack of empathy is terrible. No one wants a Dr House wannabe in real life.", "NTA. Thank you for stepping up.\nTo put a IUD into a uterus can be done with a local anesthetica (injection into the cervix). So to put someone through that pain deliberately is just disgusting. And that sister, well. She needs to stay out of this.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for your GF when the doctor was belittling her. He was the kind of AH too many of us have had experience with.  Having an advocate with you during a medical procedure can be very helpful, as well as reducing the fear factor.\n\nIgnore the sister. She's biased on a different side.\n\nedit: Maybe, though, next time keep it clean, don't yell, don't call him a prick. It hurts your credibility if you do file a formal complaint. Stay in adult mode. Tell him he's being unprofessional, sexist, etc. Your complaint will be taken more seriously.", "NTA her sister is a fool. Good job standing up for your partner in the face of some power tripping, ego driven, sexist jerk.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you for sticking up for your girlfriend! She\u2019s lucky to have you! Doctors need to STFU and listen to their patients when they say they\u2019re in pain. And GF\u2019s sister sounds like she needs to do the same as well. Nobody in the medical field should be telling their patients how they feel or how they are supposed to respond to pain. I tried for an IUD after my first son was born and honestly, the pain was more intense than when I had him. I opted to not get one. The unfortunate reality is women are just expected to deal with these things because \u201cthat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been\u201d. And that led to a lot of unnecessary suffering for a lot of women..", "Nta. You know the cool thing about C-sections? They give you pain meds. Same for vaginal births if you want it too. \n\nAs for the sister and her opiod comment I'm pretty sure those pain meds aren't being over prescribed for women's gyno problems as when it comes to that we can barely get attention, let alone diagnosis and meds.", "NTA. He was minimizing her pain kind of treating her like a child. You did a great job sticking up for her.", "I was fortunate enough to have women OB/GYN\nmost of the time. I remember one male doctor that I did see ( one time ) He was awful", "NTA your GF literally asked you to be there to help advocate for her. You saw your GF\u2019s requests weren\u2019t taken serious and you acted. If you had spoken before she voiced her pain, I could understand why her sister would think that, but your GF was in pain and needed help.", "Nah, fuck that and fuck your gf's sister. NTA. There's WAY too many doctors that are dismissing their patient's pain and wind up causing more problems down the road. My husband had a doctor assume he was a drug addict when he was having an allergic reaction to anesthesia and he almost died. \n\nShe asked you to go to support her and you did.", "NTA. Doctors are known for disregarding women's pain and IUD insertion is notoriously one of the most painful medical procedures performed on fully conscious patients yet they still refuse to provide any pain relief and lie to patients' faces saying \"it's just a pinch\". He had it coming and I hope more people report that so maybe in the future they'll start taking IUD pain (and the greater uterine area pain) seriously.", "NTA this enrages me. You get pain meds stronger than Tylenol when you give birth.  So there\u2019s that. Just because child birth is painful doesn\u2019t mean women should endure other  pain. It\u2019s misogynistic bullshit.  Par for the course for women. Be belittled by male doctors.", "Some people say IUD pain is similar to and as bad as childbirth pain. It's criminal that women are just expected to suck it up during these procedures. That doctor sucks. NTA.", "NTA. If you really want to freak him out, report him to the licensing board.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, if you are in a southern state the drug to soften the cervix for IUD insertion, mifepristone, is now no longer able to be prescribed for the procedure, and even if it is it is often a drug that pharmacists refuse to fill because it is one of two drugs used in a medical abortion.\n\nSo there might not have been another drug aside from heavy duty painkillers. \n\nI\u2019m glad you were there to advocate for your girlfriend.\n\nYou\u2019ve found out about four things today -\n\n-doctors often don\u2019t listen to female patients\n\n-your girlfriend\u2019s doctor thinks her only role in society is baby making \n\n-your girlfriend\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t have enough empathy to fill a teaspoon and\n\n-if you live in an anti-choice state the doctor might not be able to prescribe the medication that would make this more comfortable aside from heavier pain meds", "NTA. Has he had either an IUD, or a C-Section? No, unless he was previously a she, he has no literal understanding of how bad the pain is. I almost passed out getting an iud. And when you have a c-section, you have the option for a spinal epidural (I'm prretty sure it's still an epidural, regardless it numbs you tf out) that everyone I know who's had one took.", "NTA, well done ! Good boyfriend I have had an IUD and it is a massive thing that they do not numb the area before insertion ! They are literally making holes and putting a permeant piece of plastic in your cervix !", "INFO: What were you expecting the doctor to do? Stop the procedure? No doc would give pain meds higher than advil/Tylenol for an IUD insertion. Yes, it can be painful, but there's no way to place it differently that would make it hurt less. So I'm confused as to why yelling at him for unavoidable pain makes sense. Unless you were asking him to stop the procedure altogether, and he refused.

The Dr should pick a different field if they want to belittle the words of patients, a doctor like your girlfriends is how I ended up with a 6 year delayed diagnosis for a condition that can seriously affect my fertility. They didn\u2019t find it earlier because they would not listen to me when I told them about my pain. \n\nI hope you can find a better and more understanding doctor, luckily more are becoming aware of the pain that we experience during IUD insertion - However this field of medicine is just notorious for ignoring patient concerns sadly.\n\nI hope your girlfriend feels better quickly - I know the first bit of time after an insertion really sucks, I wish you both all the best for your future together!", "NTA.  Doctors tend to ignore pain complaints from women and minorities.  You did the right thing.  As for the sister, your girlfriend was not asking for a 3 month prescription of opiates.  As a nurse, she should know the difference.", "NTA having an IUD is one of the most painful experiences for a person with a vagina! Knowing that women historically are more likely to have their pain dismissed by doctors (women of color even more, if they applies), having my partner there for me would make me feel way safer and more comfortable. \nIt sounds like that\u2019s where your gfs head was.

It took my partner turning up and explaining the impact of my period pain on HIS life before they took ME seriously because men never exaggerate. Endocrine issues take a decade on average to diagnose partly because doctors refuse to believe the pain isn't \"normal period pain\" and that the woman has false expectations. Please keep advocating for her. Being at the appointment stops the doctor verbally abusing her as much as witness, gives her supporting evidence and I find forces doctor to listen rather than assume. Also advise her to ask for a copy of her notes. Because I bet they are skewed. \n\nAnd ask your sister why she thinks your GF is a drug-seeker and not in genuine pain.
