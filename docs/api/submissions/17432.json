I am SO proud of her and knew she'd kick ass and I'm beyond happy for her to reach her goals. She's graduating with the Vice President's award from her school for maintaining a 3.5 or higher GPA. We have two small children together as well - 6F and 3F. \n\nOriginally, the plan was for all of us  to go to my stepdaughter's graduation, but as its gotten closer, things have popped up that make me worry. Such as:\n\n* Stepdaughter's college is at minimum, a 12 hour drive. Probably 14+ hours when you add in two small children.\n\n* My FIL will be joining us...and my husband wants to share a hotel room with him over the weekend since he wants to leave Friday evening and come back Monday since her graduation isn't until noon on Sunday.\n\n* I cannot take Monday off work. My supervisor said no, can't do it. My husband has over 70 hours of PTO saved up so he can take Monday off no problem, but I can't. \n\n* Husband has said that he will be mainly focusing on stepdaughter, not our kids, over the weekend while out of state at her graduation.\n\n* Our two children have never been on such a long car ride and our oldest has sensitive ears which worries me with the stadium/other families being loud. \n\n* Stepdaughter has said she \"wants all of the attention on her\" (which is fair! It is her weekend after she's put in so much hard work)\n\nSo with everything, I asked my husband if it would be OK if me and our two kids just skipped it. Not because I want to, but thinking logistically.  I don't want to ruin my stepdaughter's big day or have our kids have a meltdown during her graduation dinner or just anything go awry. I am also NOT comfortable with being in a car for 12+ hours and sharing a hotel room with my 82 year old FIL. When I asked my husband if we could get separate rooms, he said no and we'd \"figure it out\"\n\nAt first, my husband seemed OK with it but now he is majorly guilt tripping me. Telling me I should just take the day off Monday, eff my supervisor, our oldest can miss school, we'll be alright, etc. It's made me kind of...not want to go? Like I don't want to be a single parent on what will more than likely be a stressful weekend and I wouldn't want to be a debbie downer for my stepdaughter.\n\nAITA here reddit?

Your husband doesn't get to dictate the hotel room situation: if you think a second room is necessary, the 2 of you need to discuss it and get to a mutually acceptable agreement.
