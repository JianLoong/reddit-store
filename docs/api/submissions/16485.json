{"id": 16485, "submission_id": "138x6ou", "title": "AITA for not moving out of my ex-fiance's house quickly enough and threatening legal action if they try to make me leave?", "selftext": "I'm a 41m and I've been living with my fianc\u00e9 in their house for 5 years. We recently broke up (against my will, about 2-3 weeks ago) and since they never put my name on the deed for the house, they are insisting that I leave. I will be moving in with family in another state, but my job hasn't transferred yet so I need to stay in this city until that goes through (which could be 3-4 weeks, maybe longer).\n\nI don't really make much money at my job (I reduced my hours to part time last year because my ex makes so much more money than I do), and my ex gave me a check for $15,000 to help cover \"moving costs and transitional housing costs, etc.\" to force me to leave right away, which I did already deposit into my bank account. But this money would only last a year at most (if I really stretch it), so I don't think it's fair to expect me to use it on an airbnb or some other housing now when I could stay in their guest room for free until my transfer goes through. Especially since I know they have a lot of money and could have afforded a bigger check (which I would have gotten if we had gotten married and this was a divorce).\n\nI'm not going to lie, it's been a very messy breakup and we have been fighting hard for months. They are claiming that since they bought me expensive gym equipment, a fancy computer set up and covered almost all the costs of living and gave me that check, I should be \"grateful\" and just leave so we can both start over. But I don't want to do that, and I don't think they legally can force me to leave since they never officially posted an eviction notice or filed with the city. When I brought that up during our last fight, they exploded about how \"greedy and selfish\" I'm being, which is completely unfair since THEY are the one who broke the covenant and promise of marriage when they accepted my ring and are kicking me out against my will.\n\nThis was a few days ago and my brother is coming up this weekend to take all the furniture and belongings to my family's house, but I know my ex fianc\u00e9 is going to insist that I also leave and not come back. I plan on refusing until my job transfer goes through and forcing this issue legally if they try to lock me out. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: so a lot of you are upset about the fact that the money is specifically for moving/transitional housing, which is technically true i guess... but they did also tell me they \"didn't care what i spent it on\" so i don't think that should mean i'm required to use it for that and i'd rather not waste it on a hotel when i should be legally entitled to 30 days from an official notice that was never given in writing", "created_utc": 1683311409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138x6ou/aita_for_not_moving_out_of_my_exfiances_house/", "score": 795, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA", "Of course YTA. And ridiculous to boot.\n\n>my ex gave me a check for $15,000 to help cover \"moving costs and transitional housing costs, etc.\" . . . But this money would only last a year at most (if I really stretch it), so I don't think it's fair to expect me to use it on an airbnb or some other housing \n\nWhat you think is \"fair\" is irrelevant. It' s not their responsibility to support you for the next year or even the next week. That money isn't meant to support you at all. They made it very clear what that money is for, which is \"moving costs and transitional housing\". You are not welcome to live in their home anymore, and they gave you money for alternate housing. \n\nAlso, I'm really genuinely curious: how do you think that it's \"fair\" for you to expect someone that you're not in any kind of a friendly relationship with to support you financially or house you AT ALL? Your concept of \"fairness\" seems to be very strange and predicated not at all on actual justice but rather on self-interest.\n\n>when I could stay in their guest room for free \n\nExcept that no, you can't. You've already been told that you aren't welcome there. They don't want you in their home. You can't stay in someone's home (much less for free) who doesn't even like you, just because you want to. You do understand that, right? \n\n>Especially since I know they have a lot of money and could have afforded a bigger check\n\nOkay, but how much money they have, again, is irrelevant. They could be a billionaire and it wouldn't be relevant. That's their money, not yours. You aren't entitled to any of it. Even a small child can understand this: other people's things are not your things just because you want them. It doesn't matter how much they have, those things belong to them, not to you. \n\n> (which I would have gotten if we had gotten married and this was a divorce).\n\nBut you didn't, and this isn't. If I were a bird I could fly. And if you were Jeff Bezos you'd be rich. We could spend all day talking about things that would be the case if they were true, but why would we? You were never married to them and this isn't a divorce; they owe you nothing. But it's becoming increasingly clear why they're well rid of you, based on your shocking sense of entitlement to the things that THEY worked hard to earn and YOU seem to think they're supposed to just give you because . . . well, I'm still not sure why.\n\n>they exploded about how \"greedy and selfish\" I'm being, which is completely unfair \n\nI mean, is it though? This entire post has been one long paean to your sense of entitlement to their money, belongings, and home that you did absolutely nothing to earn or deserve, even after they handed you a cheque for $15k just to leave them TF alone. I'm pretty sure that's the very definition of greed and selfishness.\n\n>since THEY are the one who broke the covenant and promise of marriage\n\nOkay, but you understand that legally that's not a real thing, right? That the \"covenant and promise of marriage\" is just a thing you made up in your head to justify deserving things that someone else actually worked for? \n\nOf course YTA. Also a bit delusional, and probably only a few days away from a restraining order.", "YTA, if this isn't a troll post \n\nShe paid you $15,000 to leave, you took the money, didn't move out, and you're complaining that it will only last you a year? \n\nYou aren't her fiance anymore, for very obvious reasons. She has no obligation to support you, no matter how money she makes. Giving you a month and $0 to find your own place would have been fair. Instead she gave you enough cash to afford a hotel room while you found an apartment plus enough to afford a year's rent because she wanted your ass gone immediately.\n\nYou're lucky she hasn't called the cops on you yet.", "Bro get out of her house and give back 15k. YTA", "You can\u2019t force the issue legally. Your name is not on the deed of the house. Regardless of whether the breakup was fair or not, you\u2019re basically trespassing right now.

I was going to ask whether you contributed or invested any money in this house during the relationship, but since you wrote that they\n\n>covered almost all the costs of living\n\n... And also that you reduced your work hours solely because your ex earned much more money, I don't need to ask that. This person provided you with housing, bankrolled your life almost entirely, and gave you expensive gifts for your exclusive use during your relationship, and also gave you a check for a considerable amount to cover your moving expenses after this relationship ended. \n\nThe fact you have the gall of demanding they continue to host you for free until it's convenient for YOU to move out of THEIR HOUSE, makes you entitled. The fact you are bitter that you didn't make it to the altar so that you could \"get more\" in a divorce, makes you greedy. \n\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if those traits and this attitude played a role in your fianc\u00e9 ending the relationship. \n\nYou have some nerve for taking their money and still refusing to use it for what it was intended. Also, \"breaking the promise of marriage\"? Laughable. \n\nBe an adult and take charge of your life, like you should have. If not, start planning because your ex will likely serve you an eviction notice so one way or the other, you won't have much longer.", "They gave you 15k to leave and cover 'transitional housing', which you accepted. That means you are under a contractual obligation to leave.\n\nYou can either leave now, or return the 15k. If not, they can pursue legal action against you along with the eviction.\n\nPlus, you're being an asshole. Just walk away and spend the money on transitional housing like you agreed to, and realize you're lucky they gave you anything at all. Move quickly before they take back the 15k. PS. There is no 'covenant' since you were never married. I would have sent you packing without a penny.  YTA", "First of all, YTA.\n\nThe 15k wasn't meant to last a year. It was meant to move you out quickly. If you weren't going to move out quickly, you shouldn't have cashed the cheque. \n\nYour ex was not obligated to marry you, and shouldn't have if your relationship was as awful as you say. Breaking the covenant? Give me a break.\n\nYou are not entitled to your ex's support until you have a court order saying so. You reducing your hours just because they made good money gives us a glimpse into just one thing that was off balance in your relationship. You wanted a free ride - I don't know about your ex, but that would have been a huge problem for me. \n\nGreedy and selfish aren't off base, but entitled gold digger might better describe the way you're acting. Grow up. Support your own self. Stop burdening your ex with your presence. Stop dragging out a messy situation. They have been more than generous in assisting with your transition, and you should be grateful instead of acting like a spoiled brat.", "YTA.  Stop taking advantage and being a leach.

You are squatting in their home despite them being nothing but helpful to you during this transition. It\u2019s your own fault that you reduced your work hours so you could continue to mooch off them some more. You are NOT married, nor are you entitled to marriage.

We recently broke up (against my will, about 2-3 weeks ago) and since they never put my name on the deed for the house, they are insisting that I leave. I will be moving in with family in another state, but my job hasn't transferred yet so I need to stay in this city until that goes through (which could be 3-4 weeks, maybe longer).\n\nI don't really make much money at my job (I reduced my hours to part time last year because my ex makes so much more money than I do), and my ex gave me a check for $15,000 to help cover \"moving costs and transitional housing costs, etc.\" to force me to leave right away, which I did already deposit into my bank account. But this money would only last a year at most (if I really stretch it), so I don't think it's fair to expect me to use it on an airbnb or some other housing now when I could stay in their guest room for free until my transfer goes through. Especially since I know they have a lot of money and could have afforded a bigger check (which I would have gotten if we had gotten married and this was a divorce).\n\nI'm not going to lie, it's been a very messy breakup and we have been fighting hard for months. They are claiming that since they bought me expensive gym equipment, a fancy computer set up and covered almost all the costs of living and gave me that check, I should be \"grateful\" and just leave so we can both start over. But I don't want to do that, and I don't think they legally can force me to leave since they never officially posted an eviction notice or filed with the city. When I brought that up during our last fight, they exploded about how \"greedy and selfish\" I'm being, which is completely unfair since THEY are the one who broke the covenant and promise of marriage when they accepted my ring and are kicking me out against my will.\n\nThis was a few days ago and my brother is coming up this weekend to take all the furniture and belongings to my family's house, but I know my ex fianc\u00e9 is going to insist that I also leave and not come back. I plan on refusing until my job transfer goes through and forcing this issue legally if they try to lock me out. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'll show them!\"", "Could you imagine someone wanting you out so badly that she's willing to write a check for $15,000 and thinking, \"Well, she hasn't gotten all legal on me yet, so obviously she's not serious\"?", "YTA. You\u2019re a freeloading, selfish individual. It\u2019s absolutely no wonder to me why y\u2019all broke up. My only question for your partner would be \u201cwhat took so long\u201d.\n\nYour wording, tone, and complaints (\u201cwe broke up against my will\u201d, \u201cthe money would only last a year\u201d, \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten more if we were married\u201d) lead me to these conclusions. \n\nYour partner owed you NOTHING and it truly surprises me they gave you anything at all. Now, I\u2019m not sure about you, but $15k is a LOT of money. Of course, not in the grand scheme of things, but to be given $15k with no strings and told to move out, that\u2019s far more than you deserve. Go get a hotel and stay there until you can move and get the hell out of their house. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m entitled to 30 days\u201d, sure, but you also aren\u2019t entitled to $15k. You weren\u2019t married so their possessions are theirs and yours are yours. Your ex gave you far more than anyone else in a breakup would give you and you\u2019re an ungrateful brat about it. The \u201cI don\u2019t care what you spend it on\u201d is because, news flash, it won\u2019t cost 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS to get a hotel for a month. If you go medium to high end, that\u2019s around $100-$150/night. I stayed in the heart of Colorado (biggest most expensive city *I* am familiar with) and it was $120/night. 30 nights is $3,600. Assuming you rent a Uhaul, and even assuming it takes you an additional 14 days in hotels to make the trip happen, I\u2019ll even say it\u2019s a 1,000 mile one-way trip that you have to make twice, that would be: an extra $1,700 for hotels, (assuming gas is $4/gal with a uhaul thats 400 miles/ tank, which is according to google) you\u2019d have to fill up 3 times. I\u2019ll even say 4 times just because, and driving your own/bothers vehicle back, gas is: $50*4(tanks)x2(trips) = $400 for uhaul, and assuming your brother drives down and helps you both times (300/tank), thats 4 trips and 4 tanks of fuel per trip at $60/tank-ish, thats $960, rounded to $1k. \n\nYour total for 44 days in a hotel and uhaul gas + brothers vehicle = $6,700. 1,000 miles is 14-18 hours. Let\u2019s say you divide that in half in days (hence the extra 2 weeks of hotels) and travel for 6 days total (2 days to new state, 2 days back, 2 days to new state), you\u2019d eat out 2 times per day for lunch/dinner, I\u2019ll average it and say $100/meal*2meals/dayx6days = $1,200. That is now a total of $7,900. \n\nThat means for gas, lodging, and food for 2 trips back and forth, you\u2019ve spent $8k. This doesn\u2019t include Uhaul, but we\u2019ll say $2k/trip (2 trips) = $4k. Your new total is $12,000. \n\nThat means your ex gave you an extra $3,000 more than what you would need to move. You say you\u2019ll be living with family, even IF they charge you full price (1.2k/month or so), you\u2019ll be able to almost afford 2 months of no work. BUT you said you\u2019re not moving right away because work transfer. So, that means you\u2019ll still be making money this entire time (except maybe the move, but I imagine you\u2019ll be using vacation days), so I\u2019m not really sure what the fuck you think you deserve $15k for. Your partner gave you MORE than what you realistically need to move AND you\u2019re not losing your job which means money isn\u2019t the issue.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what your problem is. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d think we\u2019d come and tell you everything will be okay and we\u2019re sorry you\u2019re going through this but uh, nah, because you\u2019re the only AH here. You\u2019re entitled, rude, and your behavior is repulsive. your partner could\u2019ve, and should\u2019ve, thrown you on your ass with zero money. You made the choice to drop to part time (kids aren\u2019t mentioned so? Why? Chores? Us normal adults balance full time jobs and chores just fine) and if your ex made that much money, I\u2019m assuming y\u2019all didn\u2019t split everything 50/50. Even if you did, you still would\u2019ve had extra money laying around. Your ex says they bought you expensive toys (like the pc) so I\u2019m assuming your money went towards that. Your ex seems like a fair individual so I\u2019d wager your bills were split 70/30. Why couldn\u2019t you save your money? Seems you just want to beg for more money and you\u2019re upset at the breakup.\n\nYou never mentioned why y\u2019all broke up but, guess what, I can take a massive guess. Based off of your words and general attitude I\u2019d say it has a lot to do with lack of help around the house or something similar to that. Grow up and be a better person.
