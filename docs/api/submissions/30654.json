People will continue to push boundaries if you let them and given the situation with a boss being recently given this position, OP laid the boundary that OP is a rule follower. I doubt Boss will try stealing seats again, if only to avoid embarrassment.", "And in doing so there is a risk that OP flagged herself as being awkward.
