{"id": 4012, "submission_id": "zd4syl", "title": "AITA for cautioning my brother about bringing his fianc\u00e9e to my Christmas party?", "selftext": "I (32F) have a brother, Luke (34M), who has been with his fianc\u00e9e Emily (31F) for three years. I want to preface this by saying that our whole family is happy to see Luke happy, and have always been polite and cordial to Emily since we have known her.\n\nLuke has been involved in several business ventures that haven't taken off. I think he's very talented and very ambitious and really deserves an opportunity, and his latest venture is a great idea. I am hosting a small Christmas party at my home, and many of the guests are people whom it would be beneficial for Luke to know, as they could very well invest in his business, or connect him with people who could, or other people who could help in some way, so I invited him. I specified that the invite was for both him and Emily as plus ones were welcome, but I cautioned him about bringing her, and suggested if he was going to bring her, he make her aware of the social and cultural environment beforehand so that she could adjust her behaviour accordingly. I did this for two reasons.\n\n1. Emily has a habit of drinking too much at parties. Last Christmas she got plastered and fell asleep at 4pm in the living room at our family home. She routinely overindulges at family dinners and other social occasions. This is absolutely fine in her private life, and our family graciously ignores it, but at an important event like this, where she is representing Luke and our family to people they've never met, this is not appropriate.\n\n2. Emily has a lot of opinions, social and political, and likes to talk about them, loudly and in company, and with no sensitivity. She once aggressively lectured our uncle about his age gap relationship in his own home. She told my husband he was, by definition, an immoral person for having acquired a certain amount of wealth. She insisted on sitting in my father's study with the men at our last family gathering to make a point about enforced gender roles. These are just a few examples. Again, her opinions are her opinions, but at a party where most of the male guests are on a second or third trophy wife and are in businesses Emily has likely staged a protest against at some point, it's not the time or place for her to be saying too much.\n\nLuke said he would think about this, and later told me he would attend the party alone. I thought nothing of this until I got a call from Emily, screaming and crying about how I scared Luke into not inviting her and how our whole family thinks she's not good enough because we're all chauvinistic conservatives. I told her again that this is not personal, that I want what is best for Luke and all I did was give him context about what he was walking into. Emily made a big show of being sulky and silent during a family lunch this weekend which I think proves my point, but my family are now divided on whether I should have said anything.

I think it\u2019s weird to network at a family Christmas party, but if this is a good opportunity for your brother then it\u2019s up to him to decide whether he wants Emily there or not.", "ESH. Emily sounds like a bit much, but OP and family sound uptight and pretentious AF.  Honestly the \"chauvinistic conservatives\" is exactly the vibe I get after tidbits like \"sit with the men\" and dismissing her views because the more important men disagree. \n\nUpon further review, Emily sounds too good for bro.", "> She insisted on sitting in my father's study with the men at our last family gathering to make a point about enforced gender roles.\n\nShe's right. State of your family.\n\n> but at a party where most of the male guests are on a second or third trophy wife \n\nYuck.\n\nIf I were Emily I'd be very happy to be banned from these things.", "NTA. This is a business party. Not a family party. You need to act a certain way at business parties. If Emily is not mature enough to handle and deal with that, than that is her problem. She's very immature to think this revolves around her, & throwing political party opinions into it is childish. Even if you were conservative, thats your business and your right. She's intrusive, rude, immature and I wouldn't want her at a family BBQ much less a business dinner.", "NTA in the sense that I do think it was good to tell Luke what situation he was walking into for him to prepare and not be ambushed by good intentions, and that what Luke and Emily chooses to do with this information is a choice between him and Emily. When they talked about it I hope it happened in a good way. This is about his career and they have to figure out how all that is navigated between them. I am sad for Emily that her boyfriend doesn\u2019t think she\u2019d support in that scenario, and would prefer she weren\u2019t there.\n\nHowever. The men sit in the study??? Why is social situations gender segregated like that, I would totally be tempted to fuck with that if I was present. I completely agree with Emily, it does seem like outdated gender views especially combined with the throwaway \u2019most of them are on trophy wife #2/3\u2019????\nSeems your family IS conservative not just seems it. She could pick her fights and methods differently but I basically agree with her \ud83d\ude05", "Oddly enough I\u2019m going to say NTA because you did invite her and the decision was made by your brother. \n\nHowever, I feel like Emily might be too \u201cdifferent\u201d for your family based of the people you associate with. If I was Emily, I would rethink that engagement because when you marry someone, you marry their family too. I think Emily is better off ending the engagement.", "NTA.  Emily sounds exhausting and totally devoid of self-awareness.  She should focus on cleaning up her own act before screaming insults at her BF\u2019s family.", "NTA. You did the right thing here because you believe in your brother and you want to see him succeed. His fiance of all people should feel the same but like many of us is apparently blind to some of the issues she has and has chosen to take this like a personal attack. Personally I think she's lucky that you and your family have been so gracious even though she's evidently been both drunk rude and aggressive at family gatherings. I have some strong opinions too but I don't shove them down people's throats or use them to insult people in their own homes. Anyways it's her choice to sulk like a child but I personally believe you did the right thing out of great love and respect for your brother and maybe she could do some self-reflection instead of sulking and act like an adult.", "NTA, but I bet your brother probably just told her that in an insensitive way, so that's why she reacted like that.", "YTA.   If only because Emily seems like a breath of fresh air in your family. \nThe men sit together in the study... WTF is it 1801?!?!?", "NTA he better comes without her.", "ESH:\n\n* Luke might not have told Emily in the nicest way, so he probably sucks\n* I would've voted N-T-A because you seem to have what's best for Luke in mind but:\n  * You seem to be trying to bring Luke into a social gathering for business purposes\n  * You seem to be defending a family of troglodytes; if my father-in-law (at the time a well-known lawyer in a major US city) recommended to me that the men all wander off to the study, I'd laugh my way out the door", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with saying that while a guest ist welcome, certain behaviors are not. If anyone messed up here it's Luke who bungled communicating this to Emily.", "Lol you made the mistake of stating your family is conservative\u2026.wait for it. \n\nNTA- she was invited, you informed your brother that she would have to behave herself.  What he did with that information is not up to you.", "NTA. \n\nLuke made the decision.   \n\nYou offered your opinion about it only\u2026shouldn\u2019t Emily welcome your female free spirited forward thinking and speaking your mind?", "The point here is not judging the people she invited or her family. But trying to figure it out if cautioning her brother was a AH move. It wasn't. This is not a family event. This is business. If I was the girlfriend I'll be happy to be aware of the type of people who will be there to make sure to STAY AT HOME PEACEFULLY. So NTA at all.", "YTA and I agree with Emily seem like a male chauvinistic conservative asshole", "Pretty much any time someone says their family is \"cordial and polite\" to someone it means they don't like them and they're probably really cold, all while continuing to talk shit behind their back. YTA just for this description.\n\nAlso did it occur to you that your brother probably agrees with his wife in a lot of these issues and may not want to do business with people who are uncomfortable with someone calling out misogyny or pointing out other social problems? I mean, your brother is probably just as waspy and bad at communicating but let him make his own decisions.", "NTA. You sound like you truly have your brother\u2019s best interests in mind and see things pretty clearly. I would just keep iterating that you\u2019re thinking of Luke and that since previous behavior is the best indicator of future behavior, the stakes are just too high to not warn Luke about them.", "NTA, you gave advice to your brother and he decided what to do, and this party seems more like a business meating where someone should be decent and polite not loud and drunk.", "NTA - Emily can get over herself.", "NTA. It sounds like you are providing an excellent opportunity to your brother (which is very kind and supportive of you to do) and are just trying to best prepare him for it by bringing awareness to what historically has been an issue, so he can make smart choices. I don\u2019t see anything unkind or purposefully mean in suggesting he may want to attend alone, and why. Especially since this is more of a business leaning party. Sometimes when we are younger especially, we all need a little saving from ourselves at times, lol, because we don\u2019t always see our pitfalls especially in close relationships. At the end of the day you still left the choice up to him, to bring her or not, so the decision was totally up to him. He then made the decision to tell his finance in the way he did, which sadly caused her upset. That is on him, he could\u2019ve explained it in many ways, including telling her this event is simply an important business opportunity that he feels would be best if he attended alone so he can fully focus on making those new contacts, gaining investors, etc. He should\u2019ve tried his best to reassure her and emphasize that this will essentially be like one very long work meeting, and his time and attention will need to be 100% on that. No different than attending a business conference really. It\u2019s OK to recognize and learn from our pitfalls and mistakes, and the people that can gently and kindly help us become aware of those, hard as it may be to hear at times, are good people we all need in our lives to help insure we continue moving forward in good and positive directions.", "Nta. You gave her bf the choice and he made it. He could've just told her to behave but he obviously didn't think that would work.", "NTA. For your brother, this small party wasn't social as much as a business opportunity.  You did your brother a favor by telling him to ask his girlfriend to scan the room and to adjust her behaviors accordingly.  He's the one who decided not to bring her. My guess is because she refused to do so.\n\n\"It's not personal.  It's strictly business.\"", "YTA Just because she let her hair down in a social family environment doesn\u2019t make her an alcoholic. \n\nThe fact all the \u201cmen\u201d retire to the study does sound antiquated and cringe. \n\nJust because she has differing opinions doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s wrong. You yourself said half the creepy men around your family are on their 3rd trophy wife so maybe uncle is too. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to tell you look down on your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9.", "Reality can be viewed from many different perspectives.. I was going N T A by first point, but after reading the second point I kind of wonder if maybe you just don't like you and therfore her actions are described in unfavourable light?\n\n>Last Christmas she got plastered and fell asleep at 4pm in the living room at our family home.\n\nWere they staying there for few days? Because if so, I can imagine she had a glass or two with/after lunch and I see nothing wrong in naping afterwards. It is christmas, she feels cosy and sleepy. You make it sound like she passed out dring christmas party...  \n\n\nPoint 2: So you hate she has her own opinions and weren't conditioned to keep her mouth shut and smile? Your family deserved to be called on all the nonsense like that men are discussing serious stuff in a study, while women are (I presume) in a kitchen. Or the part about men being on their 2-3 trophy wife? That is just disgusting, how you don't see a problem with thing itself, but with calling it out. I guess that your uncle is on some numbered trophy wife himself.\n\nSo YTA", "YTA.  Is Luke incapable of reading the situation himself?  Does he not notice how the rest of your family think of her?  Is it not up to him how he wants to handle the situation?   \n Is he not a grown-up?  Do you normally orchestrate family gatherings like this?  And yes honey, it IS personal.  You admit that all of these people are dreadful but you want to pander to them for possible money.  I've got to say that Emily sounds like the most decent member of your family and perhaps you could all take a leaf out of her book about behaving with honesty.", "NTA. \n\nWhat your brother did with the information you provided him is on him, not you.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your party and you are basing this opinion on her own past behavior.  You said he was welcome to bring her, but just cautioned about how she tends to act.  If she thinks she is so right, then she should be ok with it.   One some level though, I bet she knows her behavior isn't going to be looked at well, but was hoping people would just continue to ignore it.", "While the views of the family are antiquated, if Emily gets fall down drunk and cannot control her mouth, screaming and crying-she sounds like she is overall challenging to be around. NTA for sharing your opinions with him, his choice.  He is in for a very bumpy marriage.", "YTA. Emily is an adult and should know how to conduct herself in business situations. You treating her like a child just makes you all seem like the misogynists you say you\u2019re not.", "YTA. I believe your family must control the world supply of judgmentalite.", "yikes, she sucks alright, when you are going to a host's place for a gathering or a party whatever it may be. You respect them, their life doesn't concern you. we all have made one bad choice or another, she can't keep being a killjoy in all gatherings. Such a difference in ideologies might cause even more issues in the future.\n\nBut you may be at fault for influencing your brother, if he brought her along till now, it would be a blow to suddenly not be invited. it's your family gathering and why do people find it odd that guys go to one room? ladies y'all are gonna gossip or at least talk about the latest fashion trends. The guys are either going to credentials, finance, or guys stuff that they want privacy to talk about.\n\nNAH", "How does everyone on AITA know someone who is always sulking????? Anyway, if you really want your brother to make some quality connections, fine. That\u2019s nice of you. But who really cares where Emily sits after dinner or speaks to? If she wants to be rude or act inappropriately, that\u2019s for your brother to handle. I would say NAH but you\u2019re all just overstepping.", "ESH\n\n\nConsidering this post was written from your POV, I have to agree with Emily about you being chauvinistic conservatives. \n\n\nSounds like Emily would be better off with someone else.", "Based on your follow up comments as of this moment:\n\n1) It\u2019s a Christmas party for you husband\u2019s colleagues and friends. No other family is invited.\n\n2) you invited both your brother AND Emily.\n\n3) as your brother hasn\u2019t clued in and intervened in prior situations where Emily wasn\u2019t exactly reading the room, you gave him a heads up about what the general vibe of the get together would be.\n\n3) based on that info, he\u2014the husband\u2014decided that perhaps it would be best that Emily sit this one out so as not to sabotage his potential business opportunities.\n\nWith those things in mind, I vote NTA.\n\nI (44F) probably have a lot of similar views to Emily. However, when I\u2019m at attending a function\u2014whether family, friends, or colleagues\u2014I dress and behave appropriately for the situation.

And I\u2019m not going to discuss politics with my boss\u2019 boss or a customer at a work party. \n\nI have a friend who is a lot like Emily with her opinions and being rather antagonistic.

You're going to introduce your brother to some people who could help him with his business and who are friends of yours.

As long as you\u2019re not exempting her from all family functions I think it\u2019s fine to have given Luke the heads up that this particular event might work better for him without her.

I'm not gonna comment on your family's wealth and her opinion of it, 'cause how your family has acquired the wealth is between you, your family, and their work (including employees they may have), but... Only men in the study? Of course she feels she needs to prove she can come along to talk sports and whatever else to prove a point. Interests aren't divided by gender, and enforcing such - especially when different spaces are curated to keep men and women's conversations apart - is sexist.\n\nLive how you want to live, have the opinions you want to have. You handled this situation quite well and, yes, your brother's fianc\u00e9 is quite over the top, but refusing to learn and discuss where she's coming from, instead opting to ignore her behavior, is an AH move on everyone's part, and it WILL hurt all of your relationships with your brother and his fianc\u00e9 down the road.

I don't pander to them, I enjoy their company. Nevertheless they are the type of people about whom Emily is likely to have an opinion.", "Op clarified its not a family gathering. Moreover, you seem to come from wealth, as any normal person that has needs would prioritize making money over fighting others for their morals. Ops borhter got the message, this could help his bussiness get investments, and clearly know his wife cant hold her tongue for something that benefits them", "She should, but previous experience indicates that she doesn't.", "It\u2019s not controlling to ask guests to not pass out by 4pm from drinking or insulting the marriage choices of fellow guests especially if the party is about making business connections that would benefit her partner\u2026", "Ah, ok. Thanks for the clarification. Rest of the post still stands.", "That's normal for r/amitheasshole I'm surprised anyone posts here with their main account.", "Well, throwaway accounts are a thing so that\u2019s not proof. It just sounds so ridiculous, like a gothic novel with the men smoking cigars in the library while the women titter and gossip in the parlor. Plus the line about \u201cchauvinistic conservatives\u201d just sounds like someone invoking a stereotype.", "> guys end up hanging out together in the basement\n\nThat sounds more like \"hey the game is on the downstairs TV\" than \"the gents shall retreat to the study.\"", "Side note- good on you for arranging the party to help your brother. That was a nice thing to do.", "Well, you called it \"trophy wife\" yourself :D So you can't really be offended :D\n\nSo what is the problem with her being in the study? Becase she really proved she could. Men and women can talk about work and sport or whatever you talked with other women in the living room. Why not spend time together as a family? And if you feel need to have separate groups, why it is separated by gender and not by interests? It is hard for people to get their mind changed - and you're definitelly challenged by that she just doesn't want to follow what you were raised is \"normal\".", "chauvinists are dreadful people by default", "So the information you give Luke is that it is a businessy type gathering with a certain sort of person there.  That's fine.  What isn't fine is that you then take it on yourself to tell him to be cautious about bringing Emily.  That's the bit where YTA.  Can he not use his own judgement about that?  If he can't use his own judgement about what is appropriate at certain gatherings then why on earth do you think he should be given investment into a business?  How's he going to handle that level of responsibility?  In the end its going to be up to him whether it sinks or floats.", "They aren't dreadful people, they just use women like consumables and replace them when they're used. /s", "LOL, right? I\u2019ve never posted here\u2026this is my AITA reply account!", "Sure.  But does the reason really matter?  If it happens, and everyone else is ok with it, why can't she.  It would be one thing if she said there was a discussion that she wanted to be a part of.  But this sounds like she only went there to protest or something.  \n\nI'd also be interested to know the circumstances of the going to the study.  Is it that the father has his rare scotch in there, and only the guys drink it so they go in there to enjoy that?  Or is it more insidious.  Just knowing that the guys went to the study doesn't really give much information.", "Did we read the same response? Didn't OP just say it was a *sometime* thing, the separating, not a *need to have separate groups*. I get the impression that if Emily had a genuine interest in whatever was being discussed in the study it wouldn't have stood out so. Doing it just to prove she could is just rude. Ironic, too, that when the family does separate by gender readers assume the men are discussing matters of weight & import while the women must be cackling like the silly hens they are. Can't be that the women are the ones batting serious, impactful topics.", "I'm not offended at all by what she thinks. The culture of my husband's business associates is not my own, it's not how I operate, but it's not my place to express that opinion to them. You can have a nice evening with someone and pleasant conversation and a lot of fun and still think 'could never be me'.\n\nIt's not that there's a problem with her being in the study. It's the announcement of 'well, I'm going to sit with the boys because it's not 1950 and I can sit where I like' or whatever she said to that effect. It's rude. \n\nA lot of the time we do spend time together as a family, we'd just eaten together, this was after dessert. Technically it is separated by interest, I have zero interest in business, which is what the men were all discussing when they left haha. It really isn't as rigid as it sounds, but even if it were, she was at someone else's home, is it really that big of a deal to just go along with it for two hours?", "That is a very fair point.", "She probably wasn\u2019t ok with it because the women were in the kitchen doing clean up. I would rather talk about enforced gender roles than scrape turkey grease out of a pan.", "Since you're interested, it was post dessert, my dad, husband, and brothers were discussing something about business (they dabble in related industries). We were all heading to the living room and my mum said to my dad \"do you want to go to the study?\" because the rest of us tend to get bored by work topics. The men went off (my husband also took my three year old daughter with him) to the study. This doesn't always happen, a lot of the time we all sit in the living room together, but sometimes the men go off and talk about other things so we're not having two different conversations over each other.", "Aah, a voice of reason", "It sounds that way because it was described by someone who looks down on her, not because that's how she is.", "dude she literally went just cause she could ignore the unofficial etiquette that something needs PRIVACY?", "I originally had \"serious stuff\" in quotation marks exactly for this reasoning -   both women and men can discuss light or impactful topics, but the conservative reasoning behind that \"men go to one room with their cigars and whisky\", while \"women go to the drawing room\" is that men discuss important stuff that women wouldn't understand, while they chat about family and cooking, which would be boring for men. Which is of course bull\\*\\*\\*, but that is the reason behind separating groups by gender like this, the predjudice that both groups have so different level of conversation, that the poor men have to have a break from women to discuss things in peace...\n\nI don't see it as rude, that she wanted to disrupt this notion of separate groups. Because in future it could be her family as well and she just don't want to be spending it like that. Sooner the both partners establish their expectations the better - I take it as that Luke had no problem with that. Maybe OP is the only one who had a problem with that...", ">Technically it is separated by interest, I have zero interest in business, which is what the men were all discussing when they left haha.\n\nSo then it is no problem, she was there, right? Do you know what she's interested in? Can't it be business?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> she was at someone else's home, is it really that big of a deal to just go along with it for two hours?\n\nIt may be just due to difference of what people expect of family gatherings and family generally. She may come from different background, where she can be honest and comfortable (and family member just put a blanket on her when she falls asleep after christmas lunch) and can freely express what is on her mind. Your family may look a bit stuck up to her, when everybody is supposed to keep in line and play happy family. \n\nBut you know - when she didn't stir anythin at last event and was quiet, you just said that:\n\n>Emily made a big show of being sulky and silent during a family lunch this weekend which I think proves my point\n\nSo she can't win... She can't do anything good in your eyes.", "Disagree. It puts Luke in a bad position, forcing him to choose between maximizing his chances of networking & needlessly insulting his fiancee. Perhaps if it had been presented, to them at least, as a purely business gathering (I assume the family holiday party would be to follow) he'd have been under less pressure. But of course that cannot be undone.", "I suspect the tendency to separate along gender lines in family & neighborhood gatherings isn't as passe\u00b4 as most of us would believe. That's just a hunch. I think it's the way OP expressed it \"men in the study\" made it seem more old-fashioned & patriarchal. Suppose they'd been in the garage instead. I also have a hunch that Emily didn't have much meaningful to contribute to the conversation. Disrupting just for the sake of disruption is okay, sometimes. But at family gatherings? Is what she did that different from a guy who insists on attending a baby or bridal shower his girlfriend has been invited to & spends whole time off in one corner reading Popular Mechanics, or playing Call of Duty? \n\nRude isn't the correct word. Maybe \"boorish\"?\n\nMaybe Luke didn't have a problem with Emily crashing the old boys' club,  but he had to cringe when she passed out in the living room. Let's nevermind the gender-equity stuff, that can't be a good look for potential investors. If only OP had presented the event as a purely business opportunity rather than a social gathering, because of course you invite both partners to the latter.", "Considering the remarks she has made about both my father's and husband's business, I doubt it.\n\nLoudly proclaiming 'well I'm not going to say anything because I know everyone is going to think it's inappropriate' and then only answering 'mhm' to everything for the whole meal is childish. Justified? Debatable. Childish? Definitely."]}
