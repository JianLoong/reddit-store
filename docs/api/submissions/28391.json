She has always been into makeup and beauty and did YouTube tutorials early on when not many people did them. She has a decent following. When she turned 40 she hit a mid life crisis. She started dressing like she is a gen z child and constantly posting tik toks and IG content that frankly i find cringy. She is about to turn 46 and is dressing like my 12 year old daughter. She is married and my brother in law looks so embarrassed with her posts. She has a following but I feel like some of it is people watching a train wreck. Sometimes she will call me and mention a post and awkwardly say I will check it out. \nShe has always been a good sister and although she lives far she is a good person. \nI just don\u2019t feel like her videos are always good.

You don't have to like her videos\n\nIt's pretty easy to reply to her texts with 'thanks for sharing!' or simply liking the texts she's sent.\n\nIf that's her livelihood, let her enjoy it. If your BIL doesn't like the posts, that's between them.\n\nYou don't have to sing her praises and you can be honest with her if she ever asks about what you think; 'I support you, your hard work, but the content simply isn't for me so I am not sure how to critique it. You look like you really enjoy yourself and I love that.'", "NAH\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable for someone to not be very interested in a public influencer account of someone they're close with. It's not the version of them you know. It's content made for strangers.\n\nIt's also not unreasonable for her to want to feel supported. \n\nMaybe just pay less attention to it and if she asks, focus on positives and find ways to be supportive without lying. \"Your followers must have loved it!\" Is a nice workaround but there are plenty of things you can say that won't burst her bubble or make you feel dishonest.", "INFO: Is your sister actually making a good living, or a living at all, from being an influencer?", "NTA, but also, it costs you nothing to let go of your judgments/fears/cringe and just be supportive to the extent you can. \n\nI have a friend who does a lot of social media for her business. She has a pretty big following and it\u2019s part of how she promotes her work. I don\u2019t love it. What she posts feels fake and performative to me, because I know her in real life. But it\u2019s what works for her business and it means something to her. So I like all her posts and let her talk about it and keep my thoughts to myself. I don\u2019t lie or go overboard praising it; but I always hit the like button and I know she knows that and cares. Maybe you can find a similar balance where you don\u2019t have to pretend to be excited but you can show her support somehow.", "NTA - acknowledge that she sent the post/TikTok/IG thing, and tell her thanks for sharing. You don't have to go overboard. How she dresses or acts falls under the heading of \"nunya\" and anything else is between her & her hubby", "NTA. When someone is going through something, the kind thing to do is to tell them what they\u2019re doing is wrong. Ideally her husband would be letting her know, but you would be in the right.", "Yta. Support your sister man. She can dress however she wants. It doesn't matter if you find it cringe, as long as she isn't hurting anyone (and cringe is not hurt). And frankly if every performer gave up when someone sais they were cringe, we wouldn't have any. I assume you love your sister, so remember that and have her back. If someone calls her cringe you respond with \"she's happy and creating something that makes her feel good. You don't have to watch\". You don't have to stop having fun at a certain age. And just because she isn't behaving the way you've decided 45yo women should act, that's a you problem, not hers.", "YTA  social media has always been her thing. She\u2019s happy. Just because you don\u2019t  understand it, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s doing something wrong. She\u2019s keeping with the SM evolution, which absolutely includes being on TT. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to comment, just tell her you are taking a break from social media. \n\nI make a good amount from TT and receive a ton of free stuff\u2026 I don\u2019t even have a dedicated niche. So I bet she\u2019s doing well! Be happy for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Kudos to her. Does that mean you have to love it? No. You say she's a good sister but you're not in direct contact. Check out the videos she aks you to and stay calm about it. There's no reason to hurt her over this, it's harmless fun.", "Very nicely put.", "Thank you!!!", "I think she gets a small amount of money. There may have been 1-2 projects in the past 5 years that she made  a chunk of money but nowhere near a regular amount. I know she enjoys it and she gets free products", "I follow her accounts and I hate when people say mean things to her. I just feel like they are doing so because she\u2019s being purposely over the top trying to act and say things like \u201cno cap\u201d I think she is allowed to dress how she wants I just feel bad telling her I love her videos when I don\u2019t enjoy them. I love her as a person but they aren\u2019t my cup of tea", "Welcome! :)", "I would have to go NAH and just look at this as your sister has a stupid hobby you don't like. I think something like *your videos aren't for me, but keep having fun* is the best answer you can give her.", "It's fun for her and doesn't hurt you, at least she has something she's interested in that brings her some happiness. I would venture to say she also brings happiness to others with her energy. It's got to be hard to make these videos, you most likely can't do it in one take! She has to try the products, write her basic talking points and be able to deliver it without messing up her words or message or eye contact. She has to get ready, has to look good, be positive, find a good place to film, find or create good lighting....... It sounds like a nightmare to me and I am a professional photographer so can make/find the light, can edit the clips and upload but one thing I would hate to do is be on that side of the camera. The one being recorded, excited to show a new product or whatever it is. It's really hard to be that person, but we all need those people. We love seeing people excited about something don't we??", "It's not your bubble to burst. She must be able to read negative comments and let them roll off somehow and not take it in too personally, that would be hard for many to do but maybe she sees it an an 80% vs 20% and is happy with the percent. Maybe she just loves making them."]}
