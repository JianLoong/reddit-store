I moved my shopping trolley so it was partly between us at an able and he then put a hand on the trolley handle and stepped forward, really close to me again. I jiggled the trolley and he let go but then put his hand back on it. \nI then looked at him and realised he was neurodivergent and said \u201ccan you please stop touching my trolley\u201d he let go and said \u201cok, I just wanted to rest my hand while I\u2019m waiting\u201d, i pointed to the counter beside us and said he can rest it there. \n5 seconds later he put his hand on my trolley handle again. I again asked him to move it and I said it\u2019s my trolley not yours, please do not touch it. He then started saying something about all I had to do was ask but then put his hand on  the handle AGAIN. \nI heard someone ask him if he was ok and I turned to see someone who was obviously his support worker (wearing badge from care agency) about 2 metres away. The SW said to me it\u2019s ok. I replied it\u2019s not, he\u2019s in my space and touching my stuff. SW said something about autism and I replied I have my own neurological issues and don\u2019t want anyone touching my stuff and in my space. \nI\u2019m then called to the checkout and start unloading my groceries only to have the guy follow, stand almost on top of me and grab my trolley again. So I pulled it away and told him to back off away from me. \nAs I walked out the SW glared at me and quietly called me a bitch. \nSo was I out of line? \nI tried to stay polite but having anyone in my space like that and grabbing my trolley handle (hello, covid is still around and I know 2 people who currently have it) was freaking me out. The guy in the line that was behind this guy actually asked if I was ok because he said I seemed distressed.", "created_utc": 1679381212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11x95d3/aita_for_pulling_trolley_away_from_someone/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their job is to help their client operate in public....not touching other people things and respecting personal space of others is part of that. Her client was encroaching on your space, she should have assisted him in respecting that space.\n\nCovid is still around and social distancing is a way of stopping it. Also, after years of social distancing, women especially have been able to finally feel safe in public! Being able to be in public without people standing inappropriately close to us is so liberating! \n\nFact is, this guy was able to communicate...he said all you had to do was ask...you did ask. He then knew he was making you uncomfortable and continued. \n\nDon't feel bad for having boundaries.", "NTA. That\u2019s not ok. It\u2019s not normal to invade other peoples space and touch carts they are using. His social worker should have been correcting those behaviors but was not doing her job. You\u2019d be in the right to give them a call and ask if they think that\u2019s proper behavior or if it should have been corrected. They\u2019re not doing the guy any favors. \n\nNeurodivergent doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not acting like an ah too.", "NTA and the SW acted inappropriately.", "NTA. SW was clearly not doing her job and was minimizing the issue. You had every right to continue escalating to try to stop his behavior. Boundaries, people! If someone has ASD or some other neurodivergent condition, you need to pay much closer attention to them so they don't violate basic boundaries. It's true they may not quite comprehend those boundaries, but that is exactly why they need a SW. The SW's job is to watch them and gently ease them away from these issues in a way that they understand and that doesn't trigger them.", "NTA, sounded more like an excuse generator than a support worker.", "NTA. I think the SW wasn't doing her job, should be reported and retrained. What if her client did that to someone who snapped because SW couldn't be bothered to redirect and help the guy? Yikes!", "NTA\n\nThe caregiver wasn\u2019t doing their job. They should have redirected their charge after you told them he was in your personal space.", "Totally NTA..\n\nYou were not out of line, but he definitely was\u2026Autism and neurodivergence should not be a free pass for someone to invade your personal space and definitely should not be an excuse for someone putting their hands where they clearly do not belong\u2026\n\n\u2018That SW was the b in this situation\u2026", "NTA. You can't always assume that people have mental health issues. It sounds like his caregiver was laking in resposibility. I've had to be a caregiver, and I've never left their side in a grocery store for this specific reason. When you are in the care of someone, they usually aren't as aware of their surroundings as most people are. And that's pretty much your job, to remind them of their surroundings and how to treat people appropriately.", "NTA. FAR too many social workers are deeply unqualified on a personal level. Sorry you had to deal with their destructive impact.", "NTA i\u2019m autistic and nothing you did was wrong or ta, you set boundaries but the support worker isn\u2019t doing their job", "NTA. Sounds like a lazy SW. actually reminds me of when I\u2019m just being a lazy parent. But I don\u2019t drop the ball like that in public when other people are involved. Just at home. That man is not getting the help he obviously needs as it was totally inappropriate behavior that you were rightly uncomfortable with that seemed borderline threatening.", "NTA\n\nAlso, I\u2019m all for understanding people who may have mental health issues, I have them. But when did doing shit like this (and tons of other cases on the internet) it\u2019s always, oh they might have autism, adhd, etc like there\u2019s no reason to constantly make excuses up for these people, sometimes people are just rude.", "NTA and I\u2019m a mother to two autistic children. The social worker should have dealt with this from the beginning. My oldest son likes to sniff women\u2019s necks (he loves smelling perfumes) but I would never dream of letting him and never expect women to accept having their necks sniffed by a large 15 year old teenage boy simply because he\u2019s autistic. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA, I would have been really upset by this.\nThe carer should have taken your needs seriously and should be helping this person with managing their public interactions. It is clear they are too impacted by their disability to understand their actions make others uncomfortable or could put them/others in danger of contracting cold/flu/covid which are immoral to purposely spread.", "NTA for not wanting anyone to touch your trolley, I absolutely hate it too, I get scared. But INFO - what do you mean you 'looked and saw he was neurodivergent' ? You need to explain that line or the Y T A s are going to rain down", "You're NTA. His support worker dropped the ball. One of the duties of the support worker is to correct behavior like that. I'm amazed you put up with that person calling you a name for asking that your space not be intruded upon.", "INFO You mentioned in a comment that you normally have a SW with you when you\u2019re shopping? If they had been there what do you think they would have done or advised you to do? What do they normally advise you to do when someone invades your space?", "A guy who clearly has some mental problems touched your shopping cart to lean on it and you couldn't just move to the front of your cart?  You just had to jiggle it around and tell him to get out of your space cause he was touching 'your stuff' which was the handle, that you could have simply moved a little bit to not have to deal with....\n\nit sounds like you were standing some ground against a mentally handicapped person that didn't really need 'stood'.\n\nYTA", "[deleted]", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. You\u2019ve got problems if a disabled person putting a hand on your shopping cart is triggering you. I\u2019m not really sure why this was so distressing, so I\u2019m reluctant to call you an asshole, but it was definitely over the top to pull the cart away and tell him to back off.\n\nP.S. I don\u2019t know what him touching your cart has to do with COVID. You were about to get all of your groceries handled by a checkout clerk.", "She\u2019s mad that you\u2019re not doing her job for her. NTA from a caregiver that does that exact same job. She\u2019s lazy.", "I'm a support worker, this is correct.\nHe should have had his own trolley if it was an issue.", "At first when I realised he had a SW I thought the SW was trying to give him room to do stuff on his own but when SW didn\u2019t step in I was confused. \nAlso, yes, threatened is what I was feeling too. I\u2019m only short and this was a large guy who towered over me (well everyone towers over me) who kept stepping into my space no matter how many times I moved.", "When I looked at him to ask him to stop touching it and to step back out of my space (seriously he was less than 10cm away) he wouldn\u2019t make eye contact and kept looking everywhere but at me and was sort of twisting on the spot. I\u2019ve got a cousin who reacts similarly and is autistic so I\u2019m presuming (I could be wrong) that this guy is too and I presumed the surroundings were overwhelmingly him a little. I was surprised his support worker wasn\u2019t right next to him. My SW stays next to me when she\u2019s with me (she was sick this week so I had to go shopping in my own, also anxiety causing for me).", "It\u2019s not an issue I\u2019ve had since my ABI. My support worker is normally right beside me and I guess she normally keeps herself between me and other people, I always hold onto the trolley as I have spatial awareness issues and tend to get unsteady without something solid to hand.", "I have an ABI and can\u2019t handle strangers in my space, it causes me extreme anxiety. There were other things he could lean on as I mentioned. I moved the trolley and he kept moving to hold on to it every time.", "Absolutely not. If someone with \u201cmental problems\u201d (your words, not mine) refuses to back out of someone else\u2019s space and continues to harass them after being asked not to then that person shouldn\u2019t be there. The SW was not doing their damn job.", "If his functioning level is such that he will not leave people alone after they have asked him to, then the SW should absolutely be making sure that he doesn\u2019t do that.", "OP is also disabled, with an acquired brain injury, and her Support Worker was sick and not able to be there. If you've got compassion for the other person in this story, then you ought to have compassion for OP.", "The checkout operator sanitises after every customer at this shop.", "Did you see what agency his SW is with? If so, you should call them (or have your SW call them) and file a complaint. Her calling you a bitch was a serious breach of her job ethics.", "I understand, it would have been tough to go shopping without them. You\u2019re NTA. It sounds like you were able to articulate your need for space, but in this case the individual didn\u2019t respect that and their SW didn\u2019t grasp how distressing it was for you. They likely do meet a lot of ableist jerks and that\u2019s hard for them too, but the SW should have been more careful.", "There are other ways you could have dealt with it as well, and you aren't the one who you described as clearly having a mental problem severe enough to have a social worker with them.", "Well go tell them that, see how that works out for you.  \"Get away from me!\" to the guy who clearly has mental issues, when it's entirely likely you could have simply moved.  Make a AITA about it and I'll say the same thing again.", "That's 100% true.  It's also true, that other people should not act a little ridiculous because 'they touched my cart!'.", "I didn\u2019t memorise which one. Just noticed a name an agency name but I was trying to deal with my own anxiety   I used to work as an aged support worker so I recognised the company name but didn\u2019t retain the info as I have trouble doing that unless I really concentrate or am prepared to remember stuff.", "My support worker (a social worker is different where I am) was sick this week so I had to go shopping on my own. I tried to be as quick as possible because of my own issues but by the time I got home I was shaking.", "They **DID** try to move. He followed and kept doing it. The SW should have done their job and stopped him doing it. NTA", "That's too bad -- but honestly, the most important thing here is that you take care of your own mental health. You were not in the wrong here, you repeatedly tried to get away and get the SW to do their job instead of enabling their client's misbehavior.\n\nYou are very much NTA, please let your conscience be at rest about that. And if in the future you are required to do something without your SW, see if you have someone else who can come with you and run interference for you, if necessary. There's no excuse for you to not be left in peace to do your shopping.\n\nSending you a virtual, space-respecting hug. \u2764\ufe0f", "I'm sticking with YTA, you could have moved to the front of your cart, like most people do anyway when they are emptying their cart onto the belts and such. You are the one who made it a big deal for everyone involved.  A guy who keeps leaning on your cart time and time again clearly has some issues with understanding the social aspects of what is happening.  You do not sound like you have problems understanding social aspects, you could have simply moved to the spot most people move to anyway.", "Yep the SW should have.  They absolutely should have.  Doesn't really change anything though.  I don't actually believe there is no possible way to simply position themselves on the opposite side of the cart, or... better yet... ignore the person who *touched their cart* as if that's worth freaking out about.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude0a", "I tried to move and my trolley could not be unloaded from that way, only from the side otherwise I would have blocked the aisle for the other checkouts.", "If I\u2019d been on the other side of the cart I couldn\u2019t have unloaded my groceries for the checkout operator.", "n t a", "People stand in front of their cart all the time, it's the pretty standard way to do it.  The entire cart would be between you and this guy for the most part.", "There was no room at the checkout to stand in front of it. I was at the side of it and he came up, on the sane side as me, between the cart and the checkout so he was cms from me again and holding the trolley. I was at the express, 12 items checkout. No belts. Just 3 checkouts and you have to skirt around each other to get to the next available one.", "I donno what you want me to say.  I find it 100% more likely from you speaking here that you were absolutely capable of moving to a different spot, given that you could see clearly this man was \"not all there\" in some social aspect of his abilities.", "But I kept moving away and he kept following me. I\u2019m not sure, how you think I could have done more? \nIf I\u2019d moved further I would have been past the checkout and I don\u2019t think they like me leaving without paying."]}
