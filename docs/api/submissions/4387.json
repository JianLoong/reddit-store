No, you have a baby coming, you need to figure out where tf y'all gonna live before it gets here. \n\nYou can't ban your roommate from cooking his normal meals. \n\nYour GF doesn't have to visit you for most the week. You can go to her place. Or you can hang in your room if roommmate is cooking something she can't handle. \n\nBut you don't get to make your roommates life revolve around your baby. He didn't agree to live with a pregnant woman.\n\nYTA", "YTA Why on earth are you waiting to figure out living arrangements? This is a really dumb move. She is pregnant with your child, you're not going to have time to figure out a living arrangement once the baby is born plus the child should be brought home to a stable environment with both of you there. Right there before anything else this is just classically dumb. Also not your room mates problem, its yours. Again this is why not sorting your own place out is just plain dumb. Don't project your problems on to your room mate.", "First congratulations on the baby. A word of advice, you MUST figure out the living situation BEFORE the baby is born. Trying to move with a newborn is a nightmare. Additionally you will need each other during the sleep deprivation during the first few months. \n\nNow for judgment. YTA. Your roommate is correct. That\u2019s his home where he pays bills, rent, and sleeps. It\u2019s not your girlfriend\u2019s home. If she was visiting once or twice a week, and staying for 2 hours or so, you could ask for a compromise. What is roomie supposed to eat 4 days out of the week? \n\nDid you offer to make meals on your dime during this time for him so he wouldn\u2019t have to cook?

I thought she visits like once a week for a couple of hours tops. If she is there 4 days a week till late evenings, you're bananas for even having the audacity to ask him to accommodate her.

Sorry but he has a point, this is his home and he doesn't owe you squat. Bit of unsolicited advise as well waiting until the baby is born to figure out living situations is really not a good idea.

You are stifling your roommate who pays rent to live there while your gf does not.", "Why can't you go visit her instead of her disrupting your roommate's life? I mean, since she's pregnant and keeping the baby, it would make a lot more sense to work out living arrangements now instead of in five months time! It's not your roommate's responsibility to uproot his life because you knocked up your gf. She's there more than half the time, the least she could do is chip in for rent and bills.

It's scary that you'll be \"raising\" a child soon. \n\nAnd it's not your roommates responsibility to change his diet for your girlfriend that doesn't live there, but seems to be there enough that he comments on her presence. Don't count on him letting her move in with you guys once the baby is born. You need to figure some things out and do it quickly.", "YTA.\n\nHe isn't responsible for the fact that you knocked the girl up without a solid plan on where to live, so she has to be at your place all day to see you.

Unrelated, but man that kid you're about to have is in for a rocky life.", "YTA no one gives a flying fuck that your girlfriend is pregnant. Why do people that choose to have kids think they get special treatment? Is she paying rent? Does she live there? No then who cares what she wants", ">We don't live together but we're waiting til the baby's born to figure out our living arrangements. . . he can't even consider my request since she's here almost 4 days a week and stays til 10 pm . . .

Move out and grow up.", "YTA. Your roommate is right. Go to her place if your gf can\u2019t stand certain smells. Also why are you waiting to find a place for your family? Let me guess. You are going to move your gf and child at your current place, subject your roommate to more inconveniences and call him selfish for not enduring it? Right?", "YTA he pays rent and can cook what he likes, your gf doesn\u2019t live there. \nWhy can\u2019t you go to her place to check on her, instead of making her travel to you while pregnant and then her getting sick at your place.", "YTA. She doesn't even live there, he's right. Go to her place. Even better move in with her already so you can start helping take care of her more. That's the mother of your child and she's going to need some help.

She isn\u2019t a tenant and you are assuming a lot to expect your roommate to switch his diet.", "YTA - the category of \"problems roommate is having to deal with because you are having a baby\" is *only going to get much much bigger* and it is entirely reasonable for him to not want to go through the experience of having a baby with you.

She\u2019s only 4 months pregnant, so you have a decent amount of time to find a decent place", "YTA - your girlfriend is there a lot, and it's not fair to your roommate who pays the rent. Why can't you go to her place if you \"need to make sure she's okay weekly?\"\n\nAlso why the fuck would you wait until the baby is born to figure out living arrangements? Are you going to wait until the baby is crowning before you figure out hospital or birth arrangements? This seems like an awful idea.", "YTA-Not for asking, a totally reasonable request.

Do you actually think people have time to move once a baby arrives??? You should be getting a plan together now. This whole thing is a mess because you don\u2019t live together and you needs and your respective roommates needs are clashing. This is messy. You need to get organized because making your (couple) issues other people\u2019s (roommate) issues, isn\u2019t it.", "Yes YTA for your demands.\n\nBut I think at this point, you have a lot worse things to worry about. \n\n-You\u2019re having a baby with a woman who still lives with her parents. \n\n-Her parents hate you so much you can\u2019t even visit the mother of your child. \n\n-You two don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to live. \n\n-Your gf is spending 4 days a week away from home for some odd reason \n\nWhen the baby gets here, all these issues are going to get even worse, and the food thing will seem like the most minor of problems. I don\u2019t even know where she plans to bring the baby home. To her house where you\u2019re not allowed in? To your apartment, where you have a roommate?", "YTA\n\nSensitivity to smells while pregnant sucks. Not being respectful to your paying, official roommate because your pregnant gf is over is ridiculous.  You got your gf pregnant,  your roommate did not. His quality of life inside his home should not be affected by a non resident that can choose to leave at any time. \n\nI understand you feel it is important to check on her at least weekly, per your own words, and that is true. However your check ups should not adversely affect your roommate in his home. Go to your gf place where her nausea shouldn't be triggered by the smells of someone cooking. \n\nNow a suggestion on the living arrangement issues for you, gf, and child, please do not wait until after the baby is born. Babies have a Lot of things used once born. Moving a crib, dresser, changing table, swing, etc can be a hassle.  If you get your living situated beforehand you can get the crib, etc set up in the baby's room once and not have to do it multiple times. \n\nNow if your plan is to m9ve in hf and baby into your current apartment with roommate you may want to address that issue now. I highly doubt current roommate is going to be willing to live with a newborn that it's his own child. Plus if you have a signed lease that only lists you and roommate as tenants moving in gf is illegal.  Wouldn't want you, gf, and baby to be homeless because you waited too long to address a future living arrangement.", ">I figured it wouldn't be such a huge deal since it wasn't like I'm telling him to stop cooking at all, just when my girlfriend is over.\n\nBut your girlfriend is over 4 days a week.. so that is pretty much what you're telling him. \n\nYou know how this could've been avoided? By figuring out your living situation before the baby is born.\nYTA", "lol why would you wait until the baby is born to decide where to live? It\u2019s not like it will be easier when there\u2019s a helpless person around who shits ten times a day and needs to be fed every two hours. Were you planning to ask the baby which apartments they like best??? Are you actually waiting until the baby is born to see if you\u2019re still in a relationship after? That sounds less insane to me, but still, figure out your living arrangements NOW, before you add 20 hours a day of infant care to your schedules.\n\nIt\u2019s insane to ask your roommate not to cook in his residence in the evenings 3 or 4 days a week. He has an absolute right to prepare food for himself in the kitchen he pays for access to. Your girlfriend has zero right to tell your roommate what to do in a dwelling she doesn\u2019t reside in. I have all kinds of sympathy for a pregnant woman with sensitivity to food smells and a need to be near her partner, but you accommodate her by finding a place for the two of you to live in *now*, not in 5 months! Apartment hunting with a newborn is a *completely unhinged idea!!!*\n\nYTA! Apologize to your roommate by helping him find a replacement to take over your lease and moving out to live with the mother of your baby! Lord!!", "YTA. Go to her place if spending time at your place is a problem because your girlfriend's pregnancy.

Be happy that your roommate is okay with her being there half of the week instead of trying to limit him in your own home!", "YTA - one or two meals a week not to cook a certain thing is one thing. \n4 days a week, all evening is the majority of the time for most people's work schedules. \n\nIt's not an AH thing to ask, but you really seem to have pushed that request which makes YTA.", "YTA, your gf is there the majority of the week. If she was there once a week it might be different.", "YTA. Your roommate signed up for one roommate not *two*. \nIf she can't handle a lot of the foods that he commonly eats then spend time with her at *her* place of residence instead or find somewhere else to live *together*.", "YTA.  If she came over one night a week then that would be a reasonable request but she\u2019s there almost every night.", "YTA. Food smells can linger too so next thing you know, you\u2019re asking your roommate not to cook a couple hours before your gf plans to visit, or worse, don\u2019t cook at all in case it still smells when she unexpectedly decides to come by. You need to move out or go visit her at her place. She\u2019s not even paying rent so compromises aren\u2019t up for discussion.", "YTA. Your roommates points are 100% valid. Either go to your girlfriends house or get your own place. Not letting him cook his meals of choice four nights a week for someone who doesn\u2019t even live there is just beyond unreasonable.", "YTA. This isn't an occasional thing, this is over half the week that you want to stop him from cooking his basic diet in order to accommodate someone who doesn't live there or contribute anything to the household.\n\nA compromise would be you bringing her over less frequently, or at times when he isn't cooking. Instead, all of your proposed solutions involved change on his part but not yours. It sounds like he isn't just frustrated with this one request, but with feeling like he has another unpaying roommate he never agreed to. It sounds like this is a pattern of behaviour from you, and he is anticipating that you are going to try to move your GF and the baby in entirely when the baby arrives with this same talk of one-sided \"compromise\".\n\n Go to your GF's place or move out together now.", "You're waiting til the baby is born to figure out where you live.

She doesn\u2019t have to be faffing about travelling to yours when she\u2019s more heavily pregnant. \n\nYou can\u2019t tell him what to do when he pays to live there.

I cleared things up saying there was nothing wrong with what he was doing but asked him to just not cook those specific meal that have a smell that trigger my girlfriend's nausea. He got upset and ranted about how he's a resident unlike my girlfriend who doesn't live here and said that he can't even consider my request since she's here almost 4 days a week and stays til 10 pm. I tried to discuss it with him and maybe figure out a compromise but he bluntly told me he doesn't owe me or my girlfriend any accomodations nor compromises.

He told me to \"deal with it\" or tell her not to come which was offensive because she's my partner and she's pregnant and I need to make sure she's okay by seeing her weekly.\n\n\nHe's avoiding me right now.

If you can afford a baby you should be able to afford your own place.", "YTA. Why should someone who has no involvement in the pregnancy has to alter their 4 days.

You could atleast tell him to turn on the vents maybe. \n\nFor the future, Either one of you two should move out. I think it should be you since your girlfriend will have a baby and she\u2019ll need you a lot more and Again it will be unfair for your roommate\u2019s sleep to be lost as well.\n\nI had a landlady restrict my cooking too and it pissed me off .", "Your not the AH for asking.  If she was only there infrequently for a short timeframe then maybe coming up with a compromise to respect the needs of your guest wouldn't be too bad.

Everything made me sick when I was pregnant.  Food courts were a nightmare.  But that was a \"me\" problem, not something I expected everyone else to accommodate. \n\nFinally you need to grow up and make some solid plans about your child. It needs a place to live.  Furniture needs to be built, supplies need to be bought.  Your girlfriend is going to be in no shape to move for the first 6 weeks after birth (maybe longer). If she has a C-section it's going to be an even harder recovery.  If she's still living at home by the time the baby is born you are going to have to deal with her parents to see YOUR kid.  Most leases need 30-60 days notice to move out. You need to use the next 3 months to figure out how you are going to take care of your child", "YTA Hows that plan to move in girlfriend on the sly, with a side dish of maybe push roomie out, going for you?", "YTA. If your girlfriend lived with you, it would be reasonable to ask your roommate to accommodate her needs. Your roommate does not want your girlfriend to live with you, and didn't agree to have her as a second roommate four days a week. You need to figure out where you and your gf are going to live, right now; \"we'll figure it out when we have a newborn\" (but you can't visit your child at your gf's house and your roommate doesn't want your gf and her baby in your apartment) is not taking the responsibility of being parents seriously.", "YTA. There\u2019s no need for me to say anything else, because the roommate already summed up  everything I was thinking.", "YTA. I could understand if it was 1-2 days a week for an hour or two at a time but it\u2019s not. She\u2019s over all the time.

No wonder he's pissed off - you're changing the terms of your accommodation without consulting him, or acknowledging the cost and disruption you're imposing on him.\n\nThe \"compromise\" is you changing your behaviours, not expecting others to inconvenience themselves for you.

He should have only had to pay about 35% of bills. He moved out quickly after seeing what was happening. You, OP, are unfair even on that front, not to even mention the cooking. Your gf spends over 50% of the week there yet pays nothing! Then you expect a paying tenant to make big changes in his dietary routine just because you won't man-up and provide a place for your family, or at least make up with her parents.

And these were people I actually lived with and paid to live with them. \n\nAlso, get your shit together now and figure out living arrangements. The last thing your girlfriend is going to want to do after birth is find a place to live and then move.

Not many people would their housemate's girlfriend stay at the apartment 4 nights a week and not say anything. You're lucky he's not asking her to chip in for rent and the bills. \n\nYou say you're not on good terms with her parents either. You need to get your act together.", "YTA\n\nYou need to prioritise more important issues right now. You should concentrate on repairing your relationship with her parents so your gf doesn't have to be there 4 days a week (helping your roommate who pays rent and has the right to cook what he wants) but also so she doesn't have to travel so much, not sleep in her home and has the freedom to cook whatever she wants without stress. She is growing a baby and as she gets more pregnant travelling back and forth and not being able to have her parents and bf in the same room will stress her out needlessly.\n\nAdding the stress of being pregnant/a new mother with the fact her bf doesn't get on with her parents is unnecessary and selfish. Also it will look good to them that you love their daughter so much to be an adult and resolve the issues, but also show you are preparing to be a parent and mature enough to sort out whatever the problem is.\n\nAlso waiting until you have a brand new baby to find a home together is a terrible idea. It would be so much easier to move house, decorate and settle in before you have a crying baby, sleepless nights and finding the time and energy to house hunt will be so much stress on you and your gf.

She\u2019s not going to be able to do much to pack or move her things near the birth or for some time after.

It must be so much fun going through the boxes, the cleaning, maybe even painting in some situations with a new born.", "The roommate, unfortunately, has 6 months to move because there is no way that OP is going to become reasonable and responsible in the next little while. \nHaving been the pregnant person that puked at the smell of food, it is 100% on GF to not be there when the roommate cooks. The ask isn't terrible, but once the roommate said no, it was on OP and the GF to figure it out.", "I know a couple that had a baby while living with a roommate. Roommate didn\u2019t sign up for that, on top of it- roommate shared a wall with the baby\u2019s room while the parents were on the other side of the apartment. When I asked her about it, she did not care one bit. Absolutely zero consideration for others.", "Seriously. How the fuck do you decide to wait until you have a vulnerable infant to decide to find shelter for them? That should have been priority number one from the get. Pull your head out OP, you still got a few months until you're both dead on your feet from childcare. Why the hell would you wait until then??", "The fact she\u2019s there until 10pm smells of curfew", "I\u2019m going to say she\u2019s 19, he\u2019s 22. Double or nothing.", "Probably not. OP says she goes home by 10pm (sounds like she has a curfew - something is squirrely about the missing details, like ages.)", "This is literally happening in my house right now. My roommate is 5/6 months pregnant and they\u2019re waiting until after the babies born to figure out housing. I told her she can\u2019t have a baby here, because she wanted to do a HOME birth in a RENTAL.", "That's possibly the backup plan for when roommate understandably nopes out and breaks lease (or tells the landlord what's going on, because I doubt OP/GF will actually add her as a tenant on the contract), and OP can't afford the apartment any more.", "Sorry, I meant roommate not OP!", "I deffo have my fingers crossed on behalf of the roommate continuing to maintain their entirely reasonable boundaries!", "Might take a few more years then", "Yeah, think the \"I need the see her weekly\" line really keys into what you're saying.", "And also they\u2019ll be expecting roommate to baby sit for free because he\u2019s single and it\u2019s not faaaairrrrrr that he has free time (they\u2019ll assume) and he should help out young struggling parents!!!!1111", "Mentally or actually?", "So, considering that: at what address is this baby going to live? And what kinds of cuisine, music, etc. will THEN be permitted?\n\nIf I were that roommate, I'd get out now before it's too late.", "I\u2019m wondering if she still lives with her parents.", "They're hoping that mom and dad will take care of the baby for them.", "My guess is simply that neither of them have dealt with an infant before, let aloe lived with and cared for one. Surprising the number of people who seem to think it\u2019s on par with getting a new puppy or something. Not everyone understands that they fill every moment of your life and brain capacity.\n\nThey *really* have not thought this through at all. Who\u2019s going to pack and move houses for the new mom when she\u2019s post-partum? Not her.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "I was ready to ignore everything else and just focus on the food part and defend him until he said she was over 4 times a week. That's too much to try to ask someone to change their entire lifestyle (sounds like roommate has a specific diet they adhere to therefore it's their lifestyle.) I could see once a week being a reasonable request. But four is excessive for a request like that.\n\n\nAnd this is me ignoring all the other outrageous things in the post, just focusing on the food bit.", "My thing is, there's nothing wrong with a polite request, but you have take the no graciously and then drop it.", "I don't care about the ask itself. But, its been answered and its time to leave the roommate alone. He lives there. GF does not.", "I've experienced that in a non-pregnant capacity. I can't imagine experiencing that when trying to grow a baby.", "Ah, I see, my parents were only screaming at each other to help me sleep!", "Yes 100% \n\nMy kid sleeps so hard that I have literally vacuumed his room after he went to bed, turned the light on even \n\nWe did not once be quiet because the baby is asleep or ask anyone else to be and it PAID OFF HANDSOMELY", "Both my boys are like this too. It probably helped that we've been living in a house full of people for most of their lives, so being 'absolutely silent' was never much of an option. They've always been known as kids who could (and would!) fall asleep absolutely anywhere and everywhere - at friends' house parties (with tons of folks shouting/talking/singing, music blaring, tvs/video games going, etc) we'd take them to (or be hosting), especially when they were younger, folks would routinely walk up to us and go 'uh.. one of your kids is totally passed out over their...' all concerned, and we'd go look, laugh, maybe take a picture and go on about the evening. They're fine.  Having kids that can/would do this is absolutely awesome.", "Fair warning, kids that sleep through anything turn into teenagers that sleep through attempts at waking up them to get off to school (also, opt for later school start times for teens if you have the ability. Teens have a later natural wake/sleep cycle than young children or adults.)\n\n\nThey'll need extra patience (and naps) for several years as they figure out how to still sleep through some things while waking to others.", "Haha we did this with ours! Now that both the boys are older, they need heavy metal or an industrial fan to fall asleep.", "I suspect he knows and is putting his foot down now before it gets worse", "Probably has homework to do.", "Stressful life events like moving and having a baby go so much better when combined!", "I mean he has to see her \"weekly\" what a stand-up bro /s", "Was about to stay the same. \u201cLeaves by 10\u201d sounds like a curfew. Being unable to go to her house because he isn\u2019t on terms with her parents is also suspect. My spidey senses are definitely tingling.", "That\u2019s an excellent question.", "Oh my god. I can\u2019t believe how many YTAs and ESHs in that post - I\u2019m due with my second imminently, and we started planning who would look after our first during the delivery before we even started trying for the new baby. Like, as soon as we announced, we immediately contacted the person we are asking to see if they could do it, which was giving them 6 months notice, and even then we had a plan B and plan C if they weren\u2019t available.\n\nBabies that are born very prematurely? Sure, that happens on the fly. But babies born full term? You know when that shit is coming.", "Cocktail party phenomenon!!", "That too.", "Jesus God. That never occurred to me somehow. \n\nIf he\u2019s too broke to live on his own, he better buckle up.", "I think it's possibly code for until the parents offer to help.", "I know, right. I got a little too heated in that debate defending op. I understand it\u2019s definitely a lot of planning around a pregnancy but I don\u2019t think the onus should be on a roommate that is also a student.", "AITA has brain rot about infants. Things that are blatantly asshole level misbehavior get NTA all the time because PaReNtS aRe SpEcIaL.", "Bring back home economics. Except instead of just being a cooking and sewing course, it includes childcare, budgeting, cleaning, basic car and home repair, and conflict resolution. And make it mandatory for every student.", "Idk, but I feel like \"he's not allowed here, but you can go to his place until 10pm half the week\" feels kinda like parents picking their battles with a daughter who's still legally their responsibility, but is also gonna be tied to this dude forever \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but idk, sounds like a bunch of kids playing grownup and that doesn't typically go well - kinda hope OP's roomate already had a backup plan before GF and baby are \"visiting\" every day, lol", "This is especially true where I live. The weather is getting colder. That means hoodies and heavier clothes. Makes it way easier to hide a growing waistline", "With my first I never got a big bump for some reason. Definitely at 4 months you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. Omg. Her parents might have no idea!", "very. I wasn't showing until well I took home my newborn baby. nobody could tell I was pregnant and I loved it!", "I'm no sciencetician but I bet better educated people have less kids than poorly educated people because they realize raising a good human is expensive, takes a lot of work and therefore take better measures to prevent unwanted pregnancies", "Curfew. That\u2019s my thought.", "Oh dear, being reminded of the 10pm curfew definitely hits home that the GF is likely still in school.", ">Idk, but I feel like \"he's not allowed here, but you can go to his place until 10pm half the week\" feels kinda like parents picking their battles with a daughter\n\nUnless she is lying to them about where she is those nights. When I was 15 I had a friend my own age dating a 22 year old. Her parents wouldn't let her see him so she would tell them that she was studying with me or another friend when she was with him.", "One of my ex coworkers did similar, she was very petite and was only obviously pregnant towards the end. Even then, she could still wear some of her non maternity clothes from before like skater dresses etc.\n\nMy boss freaked out because she was doing a lot of tasks that HR put a big red X next to if someone is pregnant, like carrying crates, going down steep steps into the concrete basement alone etc. She still wouldn't stop doing it once everyone knew (I think she was definitely someone who got more energy while pregnant) so she had to be supervised the whole time so someone could intervene and take the box from her etc.", "Oh hell, these thoughts open up worse and worse possibilities.", "Curfew!! Yes! Omg omg \nINFO: OP how old is she? How old are you?", "Spoiler alert: OP was added to roommate\u2019s lease. Honestly, have no idea if that is true. That is just how entitled people operate.", "Naw man/lady, he's going to ask to borrow roommate's car, or 100 bucks for an uber or ask for a lift to the hospital so that he doesn't miss the baby's birth. \n\nAnd when roommate refuses to cover for this shmuck he can post on AITA to receive validation for his idiocy.\n\n(In case you didn't see the posts I'm referring to, we had 2 posts close together about deadbeats who somehow didn't plan for a ride/babysitter for when their GF's were giving birth and somehow the roommate was the AH for not dropping everything to cover for them.) I'm happy to see the no BS top comment today.", "Yep, happened to me, but I was the roommate. My friend was pissed and ended our friendship over it when I told her I was moving out after the lease was up. So OP, YTA, yes. Buy out your roommate\u2019s lease time and move in your girlfriend, if you can. Or vice versa. This won\u2019t end well."]}
