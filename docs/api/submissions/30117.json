They're not usually harmful, but they don't really accomplish anything.  \n\n\nIt is also important to differentiate *natural* and *holistic* treatments, some of which have real evidence of efficacy, from *homeopathic* remedies . . . which are literally just water.", "actually thank you \ud83d\ude2d i think i can convince my mam to take a blood test to rule out all of these \u2018issues\u2019 she claims i have \ud83d\ude2d", ">Is there anyone who can call Child Protective Services for you? Your parents are trying to medically abuse you; you need help. You're NTA; your parents aren't the first to fall for a con artist. Is there a teacher or councillor at school who could help you?\n\nIt absolutely can, because the treatments are unregulated and can sometimes have harmful ingredients and/or insufficient dilutions.", "Also, your body has a built-in filtration system that \"Detoxes\" on its own.  Your kidneys and small/large intestines do a fantastic job of sorting humans out.\n\nBut that's Biology 101.  A lot of people are choosing to ignore science because it doesn't fit with what they want to believe.", "Those are both great ideas. Tell as many trusted adults as it takes. Your health is important!", "see i dont want to contact cps as my parents are apart of the fostercare system and i have 2 younger siblings and i dont want to see the possibly of them being removed from my home", "Doctor here. A lot of the Facebook \"remedies\" ARE woo-woo BS by people (some well-meaning idiots, some intentionally malicious charlatans) \n\nAbsolutely talk to your doctor and see if they can help you. A lot of us try to keep an open mind to integrative medicine (NOT alternative, because alternative 'medicine' is an oxymoron, and I put homeopathy in that). So a possible compromise would be cutting down on certain foods in your diet, sure, but not to go off all your meds and wash your kidneys or whatever this crazy lady is saying. \n\nFully agree with the above commenter that this is really coming close to medical neglect and you need people to advocate for yourself. Please make sure that you tell your doctor what is going on. In this situation, I try to set up several follow up appointments while the patient is in the office, so that I am sure I have check-in points to make sure they are okay. If the pt doesn't show up, the office can call and check up on them with \"oh you missed your appointment, are you okay\" as an excuse.", "I guess it\u2019s personal temperament on my end because i personally disagree with the notion of hand waving \u201cplacebo treatments\u201d where their utility as a placebo isn\u2019t evident. For example telling a patient acupuncture might be viable when you know it actually isn\u2019t, but merely the belief it could is wrong to me, because it causes people to mistakenly believe that such methods can actually treat things in and of themselves. At the extreme end that\u2019s where you end up with parents denying their kids drugs because they believe woo-woo will cure them.\n\nTo me, it should just be made very clear that X practice has ZERO medicinal properties but if you wanted to undertake it as a personal behaviour, that\u2019s fine, but there is no proof it will cure anything or alleviate anything at all, and any such arising from the exercise is likely the result of placebo rather than X activity. \n\nIf that was the disclaimer, I\u2019d be fine with it. It would probably weaken/bull the effects of placebos entirely, but meh. I\u2019m personally not a fan of medical approaches where you\u2019re gambling on chance and just kind of clutching in the dark. Far too many people are ignorant about their health anyway, so it pays to maintain a hard line against stuff that is and isn\u2019t shown to be medicinal in nature.\n\nThat stuff should remain in the sphere of \u201cwellness and wellbeing\u201d and be completely separate from health. I have no problem with a doctor saying \u201cmaybe you could try X or Y wellness activity, it may help.\u201d That\u2019s fine by me. Becomes blurry when person with medical authority conflates it with actual medicine.\n\nMileage may vary. It\u2019s just my take. It\u2019s probably jaded by my personal experiences of my SIL who has a son with numerous health problems but will absolutely not seek out proven and low risk medicine for him because she is convinced woo-woo will alleviate everything that is wrong with him. Kid is constantly in the grip of a cold, snuffle, virus or whatnot.", "Exactly. Stuff like this could verge into medical neglect", "I agree with you on that and, since you asked, I'll add this.\n\n[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67177-2/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)67177-2/fulltext)\n\n>Biases are present in placebo-controlled trials of both homoeopathy and conventional medicine. When account was taken for these biases in the analysis, there was weak evidence for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies, but strong evidence for specific effects of conventional interventions. This finding is compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homoeopathy are placebo effects.", "Honestly the cucumber water changed my life a little ngl", "Yah and if your kidneys aren't working right, i can guarantee you that no homeopathic remedies will do anything to help.", "Then tell your doctor you don\u2019t want to be forced into unsafe medical treatment. Let them help you. And if your parents try to force you, call CPS. Better to be in foster care than dead or drugged with nonsense pills.", "Would it be bad for the children if they were rehomed or bad for your parents? Are they giving the younger kids the same holistic \"medical care\"?", "I see tricky.", "Chiming in here too, homeopathic medicine has been shown to have /some/ effect, but its largely due to the placebo affect. If OP decides to partake in this homeopathic endeavor, I'd encourage her to take whatever homeopathic remedy she's given to her MD and ask them to take a look and make sure there won't be any bad interactions with the prescribed meds they're on, WHICH THEY SHOULD NOT STOP TAKING.\n\nTBH, I find homeopathy pretty much all mumbo jumbo, but as long as whatever active ingredient in it is diluted to the point where its not even measurable, I largely find them harmless as a supplement, and sometimes helpful, like I said for the placebo.

I\u2019m personally not a fan of medical approaches where you\u2019re gambling on chance and just kind of clutching in the dark.\n\nIt may have changed (seems there's always a new study going on), but I remember reading a few years back that it was proven knowing something was a placebo effect didn't reduce the strength of the placebo.", "the kids are traumatised from their own trauma, they arent sick and are happy living here. im the only one in my family with somewhat major medical issues", ">TBH, I find homeopathy pretty much all mumbo jumbo, but as long as whatever active ingredient in it is diluted to the point where its not even measurable, I largely find them harmless as a supplement, and sometimes helpful, like I said for the placebo.
