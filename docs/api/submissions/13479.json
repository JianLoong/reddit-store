I was unaware that when I was gifted the dresser it was meant to be temporary until one of my cousins got pregnant. \n\nMy wife and I are not done having kids and we used the dresser as a changing table, and intend to use it for any future kids as well (everyone knew this is how we would use it when it was gifted to us). \n\nAITA for not giving the dresser up? I did tell my Aunt that I would let her know if we were ever looking to give it up in the future.\n\nUpdate: Aunt & her daughter are now saying that there\u2019s is a long history of every baby in our family having this dresser until the next baby in the family is born, and it is then passed along. This is not something I have ever heard of. \n\nThe Aunt, her daughter, and a random Uncle have said that if I don\u2019t give up the dresser, the family will be done with me.

The dresser was given to you under no pretext of when the next baby is born the dresser must be passed down. So that means the dresser is yours.", "YTA, you clearly don'thave a lot of attachement to the dresser and you are willing to piss of family over it. Give it to her and buy some dresser at Ikea", "This has been posted before.", "NTA You think they\u2019ll give the dresser back when you have the next baby? Nope. It was a gift given without strings. It\u2019s yours now. I\u2019ve given things away to family members & say it\u2019s on \u201cpermanent loan\u201d if I think I might ever want it back. This is understood when I let them use whatever it is. If they had expected you to give the dresser to your cousin when she got pregnant, she would\u2019ve told you at the outset. Now she\u2019s just regretting that she gave the dresser to you instead of saving it for her own kids. Families often suck.", "NTA. But if the dresser doesn't have sentimental value to you, and it does to your Aunt, even if moderately or completely estranged, I personally would give it back. That's just me. It's a piece of wood, and if it's a piece of wood to you with drawers, buy a new dresser and give the old one to someone who is tied to it for reasons more than putting clothes into it. I've got family members that I'm not a fan of, that I don't speak to, but I'll still make somewhat of an effort, so maybe at some point, the spiral will head upwards instead of down.", "INFO: Did you ask if you would get the dresser back when you have another baby? I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re TA here but ask yourself if this is the hill you want to die on.", "NTA. A gift is a gift. If she wanted her daughter to have it, she shouldn't have GIVEN it to you as a shower GIFT. Since they want to take the gift back, are they offering a replacement gift, or you just don't get a gift from them, retroactively?\n\nThe \"family tradition\" of the dresser being especially mobile reeks of an incredibly weak BS story to get you to give it up.\n\nIf them ghosting you isn't an issue, let them ghost you. The threat of \"legal action\" is a hollow one. Sounds like them being \"done\" with you is a bonus gift.", "NTA - a gift is a gift, you can't assign rules about its usage after-the-fact.  As it is, you're using it for kids in the family - YOUR kids. They don't have the right to yank it from you to give to someone else.  ESPECIALLY if they're looking to refinish it.  Once you do that, I'd think it'd lose some of the appeal as an heirloom. You can get a refinished baby dresser at any second-hand shop.", "NTA\n\nBut, give that back and cut ties with them, saying that you don't want to be tied to family that threatens legal action over a gift because they're too cheap to get a new dresser. \n\n\nThen, get a better dresser and make sure they don't get access to it.", "NTA \n\nNot buying her story that\u2019s it\u2019s passed from child to child because sometimes cousins have children within weeks/months of each other. Doubt it moves hands that often", "NTA - but I would give the dresser back because I don\u2019t want any of their bad juju around me and my family. And pointedly tell them that if they come after any of my other belongings I will out them for the homophobic bigots they are.", "We have a crib that is passed for the newborns in the family. Everybody knows this in our family. Maybe they thought you knew? iIt does not mean they will come after other stuff. They should have communicated their expectations better, but if it is a family tradition to pass it around, I could also see why they are upset.", "NTA, and quite frankly it sounds like you're better off without them in your life.\n\nI'm guessing they're lying about the \"tradition\" you never heard of (which explains why you never heard of it).", "YTA.  Share.  Just make sure you let them know that when the time comes around for your next baby you'd like it back per the tradition.", "NTA  \n\n\nit was a gift that means it is yours to decide what to do with it", "someone does not know how gifts work", "I\u2019m the first of my generation to have children. My cousin (not niece) is the second. When the dresser was given to me, my grandmother had passed away three months prior, and my Aunts were getting rid of stuff in her house to make room for the one Aunt\u2019s best friend, his boyfriend, and his mother, to move into the house with her (one Aunt bought my grandmother\u2019s home). \n\nSo when the dresser was given to me I assumed they were looking to make space for other things being moved into the house. I thought it was incredibly kind that they took the time to refinish the dresser, but this tradition was not shared with me until a month or two ago.", "Yea I completely agree with you, it does hold sentimental value to me though. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here asking for opinions, I get the sentimental value to my Aunt but I too feel sentimental.", "My Aunt said she\u2019ll get it back when the time comes. I just don\u2019t trust her at this point. I know that if I give up the dresser it\u2019s never coming back to me.", " I understand that you didn't know ahead of time, especially since you're the first in the new generation. But you lost that excuse a month or two ago. It's a beautiful tradition that your cousin and her baby should get to participate in as well. And remember, you'll be getting it back for your next baby."]}
