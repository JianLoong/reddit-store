It is clear that she is not going to listen to FIL.\n\nMy partner and I have been discussing whether to boycot mealtimes at the house. We want to do something that MIL can actually be involved in. SIL will not listen to our suggestions that food be simple and secondary, so we think we need to set a firm boundary that we are not visiting for the food.

You want to accommodate MIL on what is likely her last Xmas, and FIL (the cohost I assume, since SIL lives with them) wants to limit their amount of time doing something his wife can't participate in. I understand SIL, she is likely dealing with grief (poorly) and I think it's hard to call her an asshole when she is facing the death of her mother, and likely wants to distract herself/ pretend everything is normal.

I think you need to sit down and have another heart to heart with SIL. Let her know that you will be prioritising spending time with MIL this Xmas and would like her to do the same.

FIL has already tried a compromise with SIL that she\u2019s refusing to accept. I can not imagine the distress this has put on your IL\u2019s, but your SIL is disregarding the fact that 1) Mealtimes cause MIL distress, so cooking large drawn out meals is counterproductive and means way less time being spent with MIL and 2) The cooking isn\u2019t being taken away, it\u2019s just being cut down. She\u2019s being unfair trying to force everyone into meals that what sounds like extremely long and drawn out. Why can\u2019t she just take the 1 meal for thanksgiving and the 1 meal for Christmas and be okay with that? Everyone but her seems to be on the same page that minimizing the time spent eating is what needs to happen this year in order to maximize time spent with MIL.

They have already agreed to have 2 sit down meals which MIL can't participate in. Honestly, SIL sounds awful doing this, I can't imagine treating my own mother this way when it's her last time together. Giving the benefit of the doubt, SIL is probably having a tough time managing her grief and needs to keep busy/ wants to pretend everything is normal. But no, MIL should not be excluded from family time when the rest of the family want to spend it with her. \n\nThis is an incredibly unempathetic position to take. And traditions are just peer pressure from dead people, they can be changed when they don't suit the people following them.", "Also, maybe MIL wants the big meals.

If you still want to make something, we could always have snacks while we\u2019re doing X!\u201d that way she can adjust her planning so no one is boycotting her thing, but it\u2019s not the stressful environment that MIL should avoid.", "My family has a local park (not quiet local anymore, I live an hour and a half away and they live 45, but we still do it as it's tradition) that we drive through around Christmas time to enjoy the lights and decorations they put up (they even have carolers on Christmas Eve) maybe you should have SIL or FiL see if there is anything similar in their area that everyone can appreciate together.", "Then leave your wife home as well!

It went on for A YEAR.", "Is your SIL known to be self serving and act like an AH? If she isn't, then there's a chance she's trying to have the most normal, final holiday with MIL as she can. Maybe to her, its about keeping things as normal as possible because she's afraid of recognizing and acknowledge the change because that makes it very real that her mother is dying soon (that can be hard, understandably). If she's known to be a better person than her current showing, has anyone asked her how she feels and how she's doing? Has anyone tried to give her the space to be vulnerable about the changes happening to MIL and how SIL is handling it?\n\nThis is not to say she's in the right or its okay how she's acting- its not. What she's doing is wrong. But, if this is out the norm, it might be helpful to try to empathize with her and help her work through this so that MILs last holiday is a good one for everyone, and not a long lasting memory of fight that could permanently divide the family. Kindness can be hard, so I would understand why this hasn't been at the forefront of anyone's mind in these trying times. \n\nOn the other hand, if this behavior falls right in line with how SIL usually acts, then ignore all of the above and have a serious conversation first with your wife, and then with all the other siblings (except SIL) and lay out the current situation- MILs last holiday is barreling towards a contentious situation that, on all likeliness, is going to end in SIL being forcibly estranged from the family. SIL seems to be acting like a spoiled child who's only focus is getting what they want for Christmas, regardless of what anyone else wants or needs. Your wife needs to see this and choose between ruining her last holiday with her mom or excluding her sister (a consequence of her sisters actions, that unfortunately is going to include some friendly fire by way of hurting your wife). SIL is putting your wife and her siblings in an unwinnable situation, and that is unacceptable. You all need to have a plan of action in place for how to handle SILs antics. You all need to be ready to ignore her and leave when she tries to force her big 3 course meals at the detriment of MIL. If you all stand united as a front, you can all enjoy your precious last holiday with MIL like she deserves. Your wife has to choose what matters more to her, and she has to see that not actively choosing her mom here will be the same as passively supporting her sister, and ruining her last Christmas with her mom in doing so. \n\nYou're in a hard spot, and I dont envy anyone in your situation.

Not that SIL doesn't cook, but that we take MIL away during these times and do something else. I just worry that this will cause more tension because SIL puts effort into the cooking and would be upset if we didn't eat with them.", "What if you talk to SIL (and the others) & compromise where she can cook as much as she wants with the understanding that only half (or whatever %) the people will be at the table each time? I don\u2019t know how big your family celebrations are. \n\nIt\u2019s unfair to exclude MIL but food is often a centrepiece of holidays.", "I think this is probably the best solution."]}
