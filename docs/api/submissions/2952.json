The last time we let SIL know that we could visit for a day or two (no timings confirmed), we told her not to cook anything fancy - a sandwich would do and if that didn't work with her, we'd eat on route. Lo and behold, a 3 course meal had been planned for lunch and, when we didn't make it in time for lunch, she was visibly upset and cold with us the rest of the weekend.\n\nOnto the main issue: It is very likely that this Christmas will be MIL's last, and so naturally we want this to be a memorable family occasion. If SIL had it her way, every single meal would be a 3+ course affair, so FIL has said that she can only prepare 2 meals that way over the festive season, which I think is reasonable. Each of these meals usually take a full day of prep and then around 3 hours at the table. However, as usual, SIL has immediately launched into food planning and prep. It is clear that she is not going to listen to FIL.\n\nMy partner and I have been discussing whether to boycot mealtimes at the house. We want to do something that MIL can actually be involved in. SIL will not listen to our suggestions that food be simple and secondary, so we think we need to set a firm boundary that we are not visiting for the food. To faciliate this, we'll either eat while doing activities with the family, or cook quick and easy meals at the house using our own supplies.\n\nHowever, I know that this decision will cause a rift. Tensions are already high in the family because of the diagnosis, and SIL's relationship with the rest of the family isn't great. She has told us that food is her love language, and it is clear from past experiences that not showing up to the meals will cause more tension. However, it just feels tone deaf to revolve the holiday around food when one member of the family cannot eat.\n\nSo, WIBTA if we refuse to eat at the family house (except for the 2 approved meals)?\n\nETA: MIL is non-verbal and the disease has affected her mental faculty.

You have such an issue that if she does make something fancy, you will simply ignore it and cook for yourself something suitably somber and unexceptional?  Sheesh.  YTA.  I'll say it again....Y.T.A.", "Nta", "YWBTA:\n\nEveryone deals with grief differently. Your SIL is living with her dying mother and is dealing with the stress of it all by cooking. Ironic, yes, but it's how she's coping.\n\nInstead of beating her up about it, how about supporting her. You and your siblings only come to help when your work allows. Take time off from work. Talk with your bosses about needing a set schedule to help your FIL and SIL and visit with your dying MIL.\n\nEat the meals she provided. The 30 minutes to eat isn't anything compared to the days you don't show up at all.", "NAH (no one is) I get it, cooking for others is my love language too so I relate to SIL here. Still, her grief and desire to use food as a way to bring everyone together is inopportune. She\u2019s also, probably, using cooking/meal planning as a way to feel like she\u2019s in control of something. \n\nOP, I know setting firm plans is hard with your schedules, but maybe it\u2019s helpful to include SIL in planning other activities that your mom could participate in? She lives in the area, so she might know some local attractions and could probably benefit from transferring her cooking/planning energy into something else. Hope this helps, and I hope you find at least a little rest this holiday season. xx", "ESH and I'll tell you why. \n\nOn the surface SIL appears to be the TA, however *her mother is dying* and the elaborate meals may be a bit of a coping mechanism. \nShe should absolutely not 'get her way' to have multiple 3 course meals. But I'm also wondering why you are dedicating 3 hours to eat?? Is that how long you take at restaurants? \n\nAs a compromise, eat one of the dishes and then excuse yourselves and spend time with MIL and make SIL aware of this ahead of time. \n\nYou ALL need to compromise, you seem to feel only SIL needs to do the compromising. \nBy boycotting meal times you are disturbing the atmosphere for everyone involved, including your dying MIL.", "The above is key. Sounds like FIL has limited her to two meals.  Ask SIL when those two meals are, then create an itinerary with those two meals blocked but with non food related activities in the other times.  \n\nDay 1\nMorning. Reminiscing with photo albums\nDH pickup doughnuts.  Fruit will also be available.\n\nMidday. Photo albums continued / nap time\nAunt will provide salad/ sandwiches.\n\nEvening.  Movie night\nFIL pick up pizza.  Obviously popcorn and movies snacks.\n\nDay....\n\nDay 4\nMidday.  Zoo. Park. Walk. Something outside of the house.\n\nEvening. Family dinner\nSIL serving family dinner at 6:00\n\nIt is critical that you get out of the house on the days that she does food production. It removes you from the drama.  \n\nIf SIL realistically complains that she cannot attend the zoo because she has to make dinner all day, suggest to her that you go out to dinner instead or that maybe dinner could be simpler.  However do not throw down over this!!!!  Be calm, be cool, be gracious!\n\nAsk SIL what day she would prefer to switch her dinner to, does she want to swap photo album day for the zoo day? So she would miss a portion of the photo album day.  If she complains that she doesn't want to miss out on time with Mom so that she can cook dinner, she has trapped herself. \n\nOtherwise, let her switch days if that's what she really wants and move on.  However if she switches days make sure that lunch is going to be picked up from somewhere, and be sure to leave with the rest of the group to do some last minute shopping or almost any excuse you can come up with, but do bring lunch back and eat lunch with SIL.  Just be sure you're gone for a couple of hours midday.  If SIL complains, graciously offer to pick up pre-made salad, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, and graciously remind her that you came to spend time with family and that she is the one that wanted to make a big meal. You're happy to share a big meal, but want to focus your time and energy on a person versus a cutting board.", "Best idea of the day!", "NTA this is the absolute best idea ever. Some parks even offer carriage rides if mil is feeling up to it.", "I love this idea! Go look at holiday lights. If there is a park, zoo, or botanical garden that does a light event go see it as a family (MIL) may need a wheelchair, depending on her mobility). Go to the mountains to see the snow, or into the city to see a show. Go do the paint & sips or other art events in your area (there are ones without the sipping part if needed, but the ones I've been to the sipping was not the focus). Glass art, jewelry making, soap making, etc - there are so many things that you could do as a family and take pictures and enjoy each other's company without a food focus. \nNTA", ">but i do not think you would be TA if you refused to eat.\n\nAgreed. OP is NTA. And I think taking MIL on excursions out of the house during these meals needs to be done. MIL doesn't need to be in distress while she's severely sick and dying.", "Right like that sounds miserable", "30 Mins. Try **2 to 3 HOURS**. When the MIL will be alone, because she cries when at the dining table. 2 to 3 hours where a dying woman is either being tortured or left alone to be miserable on her last christmas", "SIL is excluding her dying mother from family events. She can stay at home and reflect on her behavior. Think of it as a time out for adults.\n\nShe's been told multiple times by multiple people that her behavior is not welcome and is not appropriate. It's damaging her relationship with the rest of the family in a way that will have lasting effects for years if not decades. Stop pulling your punches or walking on eggshells, because she's clearly not taking the hint.", "Would it be possible to create an entire itinerary for the trip? You mention FIL approved, and seems like you had all agreed aside from SIL, that there would be two meals would be okay for the time everyone is there.\n\nFactor those into the schedule and put the Christmas lights viewing and other activities specifically on time she would be doing the extra meals. Even specify how and what light meals will be taking places of big ones. \n\n\u2022*Sibling* grabs breakfast from smoothie shop while we are viewing lights.\n\n\u2022*FIL* grabs lunch from sandwich shop on the way home.\n\nIf she complains, just point out that \u201cboth of your agreed upon meals are on the schedule. We will be doing *activity x* at that time.\u201d No justifying, no debating, just state it as a matter of fact.", "Have you or the appropriate person, just told sil the flat out truth? \"Mil can't eat and is dying. Focusing on food while she is still with us is CRUEL. Full stop. Mil can not eat. You are being cruel.\" (Obviously NTA.)", "SIL is excluding herself.", "I'm so sorry for this awful situation you're in :/ when my FIL was dying, one of my SILs also made an effort to make everything about herself which was horrible for the whole family. I'd advise you to think about which scenario you can live with better: MIL's or SIL's comfort and then decide accordingly. In the end, it's a shitty decision either way, but - speaking from experience - you'll also have to live with it either way. We picked SIL's comfort and still regret it because she's still not a nice person and we miss him dearly.", "Maybe sis would get a kick out of making some of the food \u2018To-go\u2019. Like an on the go holiday picnic adventure.", "You aren't excluding SIL though, SIL is choosing to be cruel to MIL. Food is also my love language and I'm sickened by this. How dare SIL be this cruel and nobody is calling her on it. I don't care if it \"causes a rift\", she is being cruel and by not calling her out you are enabling her behavior. \n\nI'm sorry for being so harsh but I think it's needed in this case. \n\nI get your wife loves her sister but her sister is being needlessly cruel.", "Doing outside activity is a good idea. But for the SIL, somebody needs to sit her down and tell her that at this point of time, either she joins the planned activities or she stays home. No formal sit down dinners/lunch. If she refuses, tell her she is welcome to sit this one out. Your MIL is important because her time is fast running out.", "If she is able to point/touch a picture, DM me your email and I\u2019ll send you a core language board and some tips on using it.", "Could you serve the meals buffet style? SIL will still get to cook for everyone, (which I think is something she's desperately latching on to to deal with her grief) but people can grab plates and rotate in out at meal times so MIL won't be alone and the meal doesn't become the focal point of the gathering.", "Please OP, I beg you, please make these activities the priority for your MIL. She's got limited amount of time. SIL needs to come to grips that this time is NOT about her.", "MIL literally cries when forced to sit at the table while people eat. SIL wants to do 2-3 HOUR LONG meals. \n\nDo you really think MIL would be sitting there with a smile on her face?", "Has anyone else noticed that \"love language\" is rarely used in a positive context. More like, you have to accept how I do things because it is my \"love language\". Or, you have to buy me gifts because that is my \"love language\". Maybe it is just because I only see the term used on Reddit.", "Apparently OP is.", "I don't disagree that something needs to be done, but I think there's a right and a wrong way to approach a situation where someone's grief is getting the better of them.", "I think love languages are a great thing if used properly but so often people use them to bludgeon others over the head with their own wants and needs. Like I\u2019m a big acts of service person in how I show my love to others. But if someone tells me that physical touch is their love language then I\u2019m going to make sure I load them up with (relationship level appropriate) physical affection as well because I want to make sure my love is fully translating. \n\nI\u2019m sure SIL is grieving the impending loss of her mother and trying to show her how much she loves her, but she needs to step back and realize that her mother needs to be loved on her terms, not SILs.", "You mean misused on Reddit.  People manipulate love languages to get there way but that wasn't the initial focus.  My husband and I have our love languages.  Mine is receiving Words of affirmation.  I also express it with Acts of service as I love taking care of the ones I love.  My husbands is Quality time.  We find that when we are drifting it helps us refocus on our communication.  From my understanding it is a way to assist with communication not break and railroad boundaries. I'm not sure what the sister is doing but it is not keeping with the spirit of the love languages.", "No. This IS a thing. If your \"Love Language\" is torture to someone else and you refuse to stop, then it isn't \"love\" it is a creepy obsession.\n\nThe term was invented to facilitate communication and an understanding of differences and building of appreciation and has been turned into a controlling term used by manipulative people. It is very sad.", "I don\u2019t know. I just spent $60 to get the guy I just started seeing kids Legos for Christmas, and I don\u2019t expect to meet them for another 4-8+ months. I\u2019ll just give him the gifts \u201cfrom Santa\u201d to give to them. Gifting is my love language. When I have the money, I love spoiling people. I think, especially on Reddit, people just use it as an excuse or just don\u2019t understand the meaning.", "Reddit is terrible for this but love languages are totally valid. Everyone has a mental ranking of how they prefer to give and receive affection. My two best friends value quality time and acts of service over physical affection, whereas I am a total hugger. It's important to recognize people show love in different ways, and understanding the love languages of those around you can significantly improve your relationships.", "It\u2019s not even a real psychological concept. It\u2019s from a series of self help books. Ask any psych professional and they\u2019ll tell you that it\u2019s not something used when they treat patients.", "You\u2019re right. People seem to miss that it\u2019s not just about discovering your own love language so that you can be fulfilled, but equally important to understand the language of your loved ones so that they can be fulfilled as well.", "I worked in Oncology and saw the same kind of thing so often. And I understand it's hard and that some people simply don't have the mental strength to accept the truth, but it only ever seems to make things worse in the end.\n   \nGrief is terribly complex and it's a shame that counseling isn't  required for family caregivers.", "What kind of app did you try? Please DM me if you want more info or help. I am a grad student to be a speech-language pathologist and currently in an AAC (augmentative and alternative communication)  class.", "Had her communication been assessed?

My go-to expression of love is hugs and touch; if I\u2019m happy I want to give hugs, and if I\u2019m upset I want someone to hold me.  When my partner is upset my automatic response is to hug him, but I\u2019ve learned that it doesn\u2019t provide the same reassurance and is sometimes even agitating for him.  It\u2019s helpful to know what he does read as a sign of caring, so I can provide it in a way he\u2019ll understand more easily when stressed.", "She was drowning him in soup?", "Predictable.

And I don't think an ultimatum is the answer either. Equally though, professional help is unlikely to work in the time between now and Xmas, and they may not be able to afford it. So something needs to be done to get everyone to a place by Xmas that it won't be about SIL vs everyone else, it will be everyone with MIL at her last Xmas celebration.
