The last time we let SIL know that we could visit for a day or two (no timings confirmed), we told her not to cook anything fancy - a sandwich would do and if that didn't work with her, we'd eat on route. Lo and behold, a 3 course meal had been planned for lunch and, when we didn't make it in time for lunch, she was visibly upset and cold with us the rest of the weekend.\n\nOnto the main issue: It is very likely that this Christmas will be MIL's last, and so naturally we want this to be a memorable family occasion. If SIL had it her way, every single meal would be a 3+ course affair, so FIL has said that she can only prepare 2 meals that way over the festive season, which I think is reasonable. Each of these meals usually take a full day of prep and then around 3 hours at the table. However, as usual, SIL has immediately launched into food planning and prep. It is clear that she is not going to listen to FIL.\n\nMy partner and I have been discussing whether to boycot mealtimes at the house. We want to do something that MIL can actually be involved in. SIL will not listen to our suggestions that food be simple and secondary, so we think we need to set a firm boundary that we are not visiting for the food. To faciliate this, we'll either eat while doing activities with the family, or cook quick and easy meals at the house using our own supplies.\n\nHowever, I know that this decision will cause a rift. Tensions are already high in the family because of the diagnosis, and SIL's relationship with the rest of the family isn't great. She has told us that food is her love language, and it is clear from past experiences that not showing up to the meals will cause more tension.

FIL has already tried a compromise with SIL that she\u2019s refusing to accept.

She\u2019s being unfair trying to force everyone into meals that what sounds like extremely long and drawn out.

But if you were to tell me that her mom used to do big meal occasions like this, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

Even if her mom can't be that person now.\n\nI agree that if it is upsetting her mother, the number of big meals should be reduced (as MIL discussed with FIL). However, I think you guys should keep my above paragraph in mind when discussing it with SIL. ALSO, you may want to double check that MIL is not giving SIL a different opinion. It could be MIL is giving SIL the impression that she wants her to have these meals...
