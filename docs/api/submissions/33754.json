My baby has been teething for the last couple of weeks which has made it difficult to travel to other places at times. My side of the family usually celebrates on Christmas Eve while his side celebrates on Christmas. My mother's is 30 min away. His mom's is 45 min away. We'll call his mom Jane (not her real name).\n\nFor several months, Jane has been telling us that she would come down to our house for Christmas since our baby would still be so young. We gladly agreed since we wanted to spend Christmas at home for the first time. A few days ago, Jane mentioned that her husband didn't want to travel on Christmas anymore and asked if we could go up to their house instead. I told her that my husband and I would talk about it and get back to her.\n\nMy husband and I already decided that we were going to go to my mom's side of the family since my grandparents are in their late 70s. We told Jane last night that we didn't plan on driving on Christmas day since it is harder with the baby. She mentioned that we were able to go to my side of the family's so why couldn't we go up there? I told her that we were already having issues with the baby at my family's side, so we didn't want travel two days in a row. She claimed that I prioritize my family over hers and thinks that we don't like going to her house anymore.\n\nThis caused drama between her, my husband, and I. Jane's husband said that we need to make her Christmas better and go to her house to do that. I just don't understand why it was such a big deal for them to not come to our house. They would not be seeing their first granddaughter on Christmas because they didn't feel like traveling. I want to do what I think is best for my family or to help make us have a good Christmas. I feel like the drama could've all been avoided if I just would've gave in and immediately said yes to going to her house. Jane is upset over this situation as well as I am.\n\nAITA for not wanting to go to her house?\n\nEDIT: I am not able to comment so I wanted to mention that father in law had no particular reasons for not wanting to travel. It was his personal preference. My husband really wanted to see his family on Christmas, but we were going back and forth. The next time they would've wanted to see us to celebrate would be the following weekend.", "created_utc": 1703574810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r2i5s/aita_for_not_wanting_to_drive_45_min_to_my_mother/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not the first generation to have children.  They are portable, they cry, they will have no damage whatsoever if schedules are changed.   Your parents are older. They will get sick and die.  I would do anything to drive 45 minutes with a screaming baby to see them when again.  You are blessed you have both sides still.  Focus on what really matters.  You will regret it otherwise. Just another way to think about it.  Is it really worth it ?", "NTA. They are the ones who changed their plans. If you could accommodate them, great. But 2 days on the road with a fussy baby? Nah. Set another time to see them. Tell hubby this is his job, not yours.", "NTA\n\nIf the baby is fussy then why put yourself through hell and back just to visit a family member.

Food would have been bought and presents bought and the house all set up ready for your daughter. That really sucks for them. While you definitely didn't have to bend over backwards to people who wouldn't drive to you - you should have given them the courtesy of notice.\n\nAnd I can see why your MIL feels second best with the short notice if you're driving a similar distance for your family. I have the same family dynamic with both families close by and our kids the only grandkids and have to be careful to not make anyone feel second best - and making the effort for one and not the other definitely wouldn't go down well. \n\nI feel for your husband too.

Do it now before another holiday becomes this. \n\nMy MIL had the audacity to call me and attempted to talk smack about not visiting her the day my grandmother died.
