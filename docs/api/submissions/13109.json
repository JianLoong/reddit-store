{"id": 13109, "submission_id": "120zfs2", "title": "AITA for making a scene at my sister's wedding, which she spent more than 10k on, over a joke?", "selftext": "My sister (24f) got married last week. Her wedding was very well planned out- we recieved invitations 6 months before and my sister poured about 10,000$ into this wedding- and that's without catering costs added. She also invited over 100 people- it was an ethnic wedding, so there were some friends of friends.\n\nThe ceremony was beautiful. There were so many pictures taken, everyone was having a great time, I dream of eating the food I ate there just once again in my life. Even the rehearsal dinner a week before was magical.\n\nThe issue came after my sister and her husband said \"I do\"- it was the reception. The cake was cut, and everything was great. They were laughing and having a good time, and then they went back up and said their speeches. Her husband's speech was touching with a humourous twist. When it came time for her to say hers, however, things went south.\n\nShe started off great, making a few jokes about a few family members. Nothing harmful. But then it got to me. She made a joke about considering having a dry wedding because I was \"such an addict\". To clarify, I have struggled with an alcohol addiction, and she is well aware.\n\nShe was never really supportive of my recovery journey because she always saw me as an addict. My sister has this idea that once you struggle with an addiction, you go crazy and lose control if you get the chance again. No matter if you recover or not, in her eyes, you're always an addict.\n\nEveryone laughed and I felt humiliated. She was laughing too and then continued. I didn't want to interrupt her so I just waited. I felt like crying and screaming at the same time, it was a rage yet sadness I'd never experienced before.\n\nAfter her speech, I spoke up. I brought her somewhere private. I told her that I didn't appreciate her joke and it wasn't funny, and that I felt she humiliated me. She got so angry and started yelling, things like \"I have a whole wedding waiting for me back there, who do you think you are to bring me here and waste my time\" and \"It's just a joke, don't be so pissy\". She accused me of ruining her wedding and started screaming. She left back to the ceremony and I just stood there.\n\nOnce I came back, everyone was staring at me and my sister was sobbing in my dad's arms. My dad proceeded to yell at me telling me I ruined my sister's wedding and made a scene. I yelled back and when I noticed a lot of people were watching, I got angry and left.\n\nNow all my family's mad at me and they won't stop sending me texts telling me I should apologize. I don't want to. AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: Based on the comments, I would like to clarify a few things. I think I may be the asshole because once I left and saw my dad, he started yelling at me and I yelled back. If i'd just left, i wouldn't have caused a scene. I also would like to say this is not the first time my sister has made a distasteful comment about my addiction struggles, and my parents excuse her every time. They tell me they don't agree with her but I should \"put up with her\" and \"understand her\". Lastly, the wedding and reception was still going on- I pulled her away immediately after so people were looking at us. I think her reaction was because she was anxious since people were looking and she didn't want to leave such a special moment.", "created_utc": 1679693542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120zfs2/aita_for_making_a_scene_at_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 1969, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think that was uncalled for, since it wasn't the focus of the wedding.\n\nI feel like your sister wanted to include this in her speech just to make you look bad. She thought she could get away with this since it's her wedding.\n\nRecovering from alcohol is a major accomplishment. You should be proud!", "NTA your \"sister\" shouldn't make light of a serious problem, especially in front of the whole now extended family and friends. You spoke to her privately where she was reactive with anger that suddenly becomes uncontrollable sobbing where she can garner sympathy.

Golden Child knows exactly when to start the water works doesn't she.

I will bet 1000 fake internet points that your sister does hard drugs socially and if your recovery intimidates her like that its because YOU are NOT the addict of\nthe family. Honestly, I'd go scorched earth but I'm probably projecting.", "NTA The only reason she brought you up in her speech was to put you down, not to be 'funny.' I assume she is the golden child by your parents' reaction, and the fact that at her own wedding she immediately had to go cry to daddy just because you told her something she didn't like in private. Unfortunately, it sounds like you need to keep LC or NC with the entire family, for your own mental health and recovery, since your parents will always take her side.", "NTA. Good work on your recovery. It's not easy.", "NTA. You acted way better then I would have I would have walked out right in the middle of her speech and that would embarrass her even more", "You did it better than I would have.

I'm guessing she's the golden child.", "You took her to a private place to talk to her, she started screaming & got everyone else involved. YOU didn't 'ruin' her wedding, she did. \n\nThis was in no way a **joke**, this was deliberate & hurtful jab at you. It definitely wasn't funny!  \n\nMy husband is also a recovering alcoholic, should have died at age 46, needed 4 blood transfusions & a week in the hospital--was told point blank, his blood levels were (direct quote) \"incompatible with life\" and his next drink would kill him. He'd done that much damage to his body. He's been sober for 20+ years now, but he still remembers....\n\nSo, you continue to be \"pissy\" anyway you can! And if \"The Fammmillly!\" doesn't like it.....well, too bad. Their drama is not worth your life. \n\nBest wishes & good luck on your recovery, Stay strong.", "NTA.\n\nCould you have handed it more tactfully? Sure (even though you were quite tactful, in my opinion). But did you need to? No.\n\nWhat you sister said was shitty, and she deserved to be called out (it was nice of you to do so privately).  Also, you parents suck (\"they tell me they don't agree with her but I should 'put up with her' and 'understand her').  No one should have to \"put up with\" or \"understand\" someone who is making light of their addiction.", "I think with your edit i'll say ESH.\n\nI can't really blame you for what you did, but I think the non-asshole move would have been to just leave and address things after the fact.\n\nSuper fucked up what your sister did. Wedding speeches are so not the time and place to make fun of someone for their addiction. I mean, good natured humor is fine, obviously, but this sounds like it was far from good natured.", "ESH. She is by far the main AH of this story, but you aren't blameless either in this. \n\nWas her joke mean-spirited and in very poor taste? That's without question. Were you within your right to confront her about it **privately**, letting her know you felt blindsided and hurt by her making light of a tough time in your life? Of course.\n\nBut right at the end of the speech, while formalities are still going on?? If you needed some space to clear your head and get away, you could have just left and come back and talked to her a little bit later. Effectively dragging someone away from an active event (which they are leading) and in front of 100 people is NOT a private confrontation.\n\nShe certainly stoked the flames, but you let your initial emotions get the better of you and really escalated the situation.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH \n\nYou could have waited til another time to bring it up. It is a sensitive issue and you already highlighted your sister has a shitty attitude towards your recovery.\n\nYour sister sucks too - she is obviously really unsupportive and you didn\u2019t make a scene, you took her privately aside then SHE made a scene about it.", "ESH \n\nYou should have left and spoken to her about this at a later date. She never should have made the comment. You shouldn\u2019t require every venue/event you attend to be dry, and if you are asking for this that leans it more towards you being TAH, but if she did it just to be able to make this joke bit more towards her. \n\nNo matter what it sounds like y\u2019all have a terrible family dynamic, and I can\u2019t help but think that is because your recovery is centered around everyone needing to accommodate your recovery, not you determining your triggers and learning coping mechanisms so your addiction doesn\u2019t keep being something impacting everyone around you.\n\nEta my father is an alcoholic, he battled it for years and has been sober for almost 14 years. It is still HARD for him to be around people drinking, so he limits his time around people who drink/are drinking. My partner\u2019s family LOVES to drink (they are all relatively healthy about it) and they always invite my parents to any gathering they are having. My dad comes, hangs out around the fire pit keeping it going (to give him something to do), eats them the moment it is politic to do so he and my mom are out. It is hard to deal with addictions, but it is your addiction.", "ESH\n\nYour sister was wrong for that type of joke at your expense at the reception in front of others, you are wrong for handling it right then and there instead of waiting until the wedding reception was completely over.

Your family at best doesn't sound supportive to you and at worst a source of toxic bullshit you might want to distance yourself from.", "NTA it was her moment in the sun and she took a cheap shot at you. Your sister doesn\u2019t like you. Know that. She is the golden child and you probably are the scapegoat of the family they all look down on. You handled it with class. The reason she handled it the way she did it because people don\u2019t normally stand up to her.", "This family sounds very healthy", "NTA\n\nYour sister caused a scene because she wanted to punish you, but also because it may have clicked in her head that other people might think less of her because of her very cruel jab at you, so she needed to have a meltdown to garner sympathy and turn you into the villain.\n\nTell your parents and the rest of your family that she chose to ruin her own wedding, first when she decided to publicly humiliate you and second when she chose to create a public scene after you approached her privately.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s antics were horrifying, and your dad was unsupportive too. She didn\u2019t have to go there. She deserved an immediate clap back and should be grateful you took her aside.

Edited for spelling.", "Do not understand why people say \" put up with it\" or \"understand her\" Why should you? So, you have to take the insults, the abuse, but that person doesn't?", "It wasn't a joke. It was a way to aggrandize herself at your expense. I commend you on both your sobriety and in not kicking over tables on your way out. You're a lot classier than she is. NTA.", "NTA. But your sister and parents who enable her are. They should be ashamed of her for saying something insensitive as a \u201cjoke\u201d in her speech. And they should have told your sister to understand you and the struggle you went through, not the other way around. You can tell them that they are failures because they only want to protect the feelings of one child and not fostering understanding between both of you.", "NTA - I saw your edit before reading the comments and I think you need to read them again to see the overwhelming support you\u2019re getting. I agree with alllll the other redditors and their comments pointing out you were thoughtful by talking to your sister in private and she was the AH who made it public, and your parents only made it a bigger AH scene. You\u2019re doing an amazing job of rising above but please don\u2019t let your family twist the story.", "Sorry this is not really relevant but 10,000 for a wedding isn\u2019t that much right?

She ruined her own wedding.   \nBest wishes on your continued journey.", "NTA, but your sister certainly is! \n\nStatistically speaking, you were absolutely not the only person there who has had an addiction to overcome, never mind those who are currently fighting their own battles. So she passively insulted other guests, too. \n\nWhat she did was mean spirited and crossed the line. She clearly still has some hate festering for the person you were prior to your recovery. Your family should have had your back, wedding or not. \n\nCongratulations, btw, on your recovery. Alcohol withdrawal is so scary. I\u2019m glad you made it!", "NTA. And also your parents are AH for being inconsiderate of your journey and struggles. \n\nNo one needs to \"put up\" with inconsiderate PUBLIC jokes in a speech about someone's personal struggles.

I'm so sorry that your sister did that to you. It seems to me that if your parents are excusing her like you said, that she may very well be the golden child.", "NTA: your sister is an abusive LIAR who clearly gets her actions excused. Put your foot down with your family. Tell them their clear and obvious favoritism is unacceptable and DISGRACEFUL. THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED. If someone attacks and humiliates your child, then lies and sobs for sympathy, that behavior should be corrected. Not coddled. Disgusting.", "When did it become a thing to roast family members at weddings anyway. Really poor taste.  Not the A but your sister sure is.  In hindsight I guess OP should have responded during the speech since the bride made it public anyway.", "NTA. There's nothing funny about addiction. If she'd just returned to the wedding instead of crying in your dad's arms there would not have been a scene. She sounds horribly unsympathetic to your struggles. Your whole family sucks for letting her get away with it.", "NTA. You need to cut ties with her and anyone who enables her. Humiliating you publicly like this this is incredibly shitty.", "NTA Don\u2019t you dare apologize for sticking up for yourself when your own sister decided to once again publicly humiliate you. From now on when she decided to verbally abuse you clap back and shut her down. She\u2019ll learn to leave you alone when she knows you\u2019re going to no longer accept her disrespect.

She made a scene, making it public, getting loud about it. She did the drama for pity points.\n\nThat wasn't a joke, it was tasteless, crass, and hurtful. You told her it was hurtful, and she blew you off. Time to walk away.", "NTA.   \nShe ruined her wedding. You don\u2019t need toxic people in your life, go NC.", "NTA you should have Will Smith'd her.", "NTA.  Her joke caused all the drama.", "Nta, you spoke to her privately for what 3 minutes?

Timing could have been a bit better too, maybe waiting a few minutes before pulling her aside. But those honestly are tiny things.

Seriously, what sane person uses their wedding speech to insult someone else. \n\nSorry you had to go through that.", "NTA OP.  SHE is TA for making the joke about your sobriety.  Yeah, perhaps you should have just left and informed your parents why, but she brought that little tirade of yours on her own head.", "NTA.

For your sanity & sobriety I would go little to no contact with them all", "NTA. You didn't make a scene, she did. Why the hell was she sobbing into your dads arms?? \n\n\nHer \"joke\" was not funny, it was offensive and hurtful to you.

How dare she. I'm so sorry. NTA and I hope your chosen family showers you with love and kindness.", "NTA. With family like that I see why you drink", "Wtf. Nta!

She absolutely no right to joke about ur situation. She publicly embarrassed you and publicly shamed you for something you shouldn't be shamed for. she handled it like a child.", "She is the asshole and the one who made it a big scene. Sobbing because you were hurt by what came out of her mouth? My 5 year old does that. All she had to do was say \"that did sound kinda bad, I am so sorry to have embarrassed you\" and yall would have moved on. \n\nYou took her off to the side. \n\nDad fussed at you in the middle of everyone. Sister was boo hooing in the middle of everyone. You reacted, and that could have been handled better, but you certainly didn't start it or *ruin* anything. \n\nThat's on them.", "NTA!

It seems like she's the golden child and you're the scapegoat.
