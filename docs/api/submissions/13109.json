{"id": 13109, "submission_id": "120zfs2", "title": "AITA for making a scene at my sister's wedding, which she spent more than 10k on, over a joke?", "selftext": "My sister (24f) got married last week. Her wedding was very well planned out- we recieved invitations 6 months before and my sister poured about 10,000$ into this wedding- and that's without catering costs added. She also invited over 100 people- it was an ethnic wedding, so there were some friends of friends.\n\nThe ceremony was beautiful. There were so many pictures taken, everyone was having a great time, I dream of eating the food I ate there just once again in my life. Even the rehearsal dinner a week before was magical.\n\nThe issue came after my sister and her husband said \"I do\"- it was the reception. The cake was cut, and everything was great. They were laughing and having a good time, and then they went back up and said their speeches. Her husband's speech was touching with a humourous twist. When it came time for her to say hers, however, things went south.\n\nShe started off great, making a few jokes about a few family members. Nothing harmful. But then it got to me. She made a joke about considering having a dry wedding because I was \"such an addict\". To clarify, I have struggled with an alcohol addiction, and she is well aware.\n\nShe was never really supportive of my recovery journey because she always saw me as an addict. My sister has this idea that once you struggle with an addiction, you go crazy and lose control if you get the chance again. No matter if you recover or not, in her eyes, you're always an addict.\n\nEveryone laughed and I felt humiliated. She was laughing too and then continued. I didn't want to interrupt her so I just waited. I felt like crying and screaming at the same time, it was a rage yet sadness I'd never experienced before.\n\nAfter her speech, I spoke up. I brought her somewhere private. I told her that I didn't appreciate her joke and it wasn't funny, and that I felt she humiliated me. She got so angry and started yelling, things like \"I have a whole wedding waiting for me back there, who do you think you are to bring me here and waste my time\" and \"It's just a joke, don't be so pissy\". She accused me of ruining her wedding and started screaming. She left back to the ceremony and I just stood there.\n\nOnce I came back, everyone was staring at me and my sister was sobbing in my dad's arms. My dad proceeded to yell at me telling me I ruined my sister's wedding and made a scene. I yelled back and when I noticed a lot of people were watching, I got angry and left.\n\nNow all my family's mad at me and they won't stop sending me texts telling me I should apologize. I don't want to. AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: Based on the comments, I would like to clarify a few things. I think I may be the asshole because once I left and saw my dad, he started yelling at me and I yelled back. If i'd just left, i wouldn't have caused a scene. I also would like to say this is not the first time my sister has made a distasteful comment about my addiction struggles, and my parents excuse her every time. They tell me they don't agree with her but I should \"put up with her\" and \"understand her\". Lastly, the wedding and reception was still going on- I pulled her away immediately after so people were looking at us. I think her reaction was because she was anxious since people were looking and she didn't want to leave such a special moment.", "created_utc": 1679693542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120zfs2/aita_for_making_a_scene_at_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her reaction to that was public - aka, she ruined her own wedding.\n\nNTA. Brava for being so classy and strong. Very impressive!", "NTA.  She publicly humiliated you, and you privately told her that wasn't okay.  I am not understanding her reaction, unless some context is missing.", "You didn\u2019t make a scene, you took her somewhere private and told her that she\u2019s hurt your feelings.\n\nNTA \n\nShe sure is an AH though", "NTA. \n\nYou made sure to have expressed your feelings regarding the cruel \"joke\" in a way that would NOT make a scene. \n\nShe was the one who decided to act out in public.", "NTA\nYour sister was way out of line for mocking you for your recovery.  She should have been celebrating it, or at the very least, not mentioned it in public.  She deliberately chose to humiliate and embarass you.  You called her out for it privately, she then chose to make it public by literally crying in daddy's arms in public.  SHE ruined her own wedding.  \n\nA joke should be funny, what she said wasn't.  And shame on anyone who laughed along.", "NTA All you did was spoke up to your sister in private. The only person who ruined the day was your sister. You owe no apologies but your sister does for humiliating you.", "I'm going to go with NTA.  Your sister got upset that you called her out on her sick \"joke\".  Addiction recovery is no joking matter.  I'm sorry you had to go through that humiliation, especially over something so private.", "Does your sister often have overly dramatic emotional outbursts? Do your parents then coddle her?  Do they usually blame you for things that you didn\u2019t cause? \n\nNTA, she\u2019s lucky you\u2019re not a bitch like me because she would have had wine thrown at her dress on my way out. What she said was more than distasteful, it could have been harmful to you. Honestly I don\u2019t think you owe anyone an apology, they all owe you one.", "So you took her aside, and privately discussed your feelings. Your sister took it upon herself to dismiss your feelings and return to her own wedding a cause a scene. NTA", "~~INFO: I'm leaning~~ NTA\n\nWhat else was said about you struggling with alcohol?\n\nTo my understanding, you didn't make a scene. You just talked to your sister in \\*private\\* about her speech.\n\nI'm not giving her a pass about her speech and your struggles with alcohol. I think that was uncalled for, since it wasn't the focus of the wedding.\n\nI feel like your sister wanted to include this in her speech just to make you look bad. She thought she could get away with this since it's her wedding.\n\nRecovering from alcohol is a major accomplishment. You should be proud!", "NTA your \"sister\" shouldn't make light of a serious problem, especially in front of the whole now extended family and friends. You spoke to her privately where she was reactive with anger that suddenly becomes uncontrollable sobbing where she can garner sympathy. She caused a scene and she wants to manipulate everyone into thinking you're the awful one. \n\nHonestly I've cut \"family\" out of my life for less than this. Be proud and stay strong alcoholism is a terrible thing because it's readily available almost everywhere.", "NTA. That shit had no business being in a wedding speech. Seems like she paid $10k just for the opportunity to shit on you.", "Nta. A joke is only a joke if everyone finds it funny", "NTA - she made a distasteful and cruel joke. You took her to a private spot to tell her your feelings. Yes, I personally would\u2019ve waited until after the wedding but whatever. She\u2019s still the AH.", "Woof. NTA unless I\u2019m missing context here.", "NTA totally, your sister sounds horrible", "NTA at all. you didn\u2019t ruin her wedding, she made a joke in very poor taste about something that isn\u2019t even remotely funny, and you handled it the mature way - didn\u2019t make a scene at all, instead, waited and then privately expressed your feelings. that is the absolute opposite of ruining a wedding. that is concealing your feelings to make sure you didn\u2019t ruin the wedding. she went and raised her voice after getting called out *on something wrong that she did* and that\u2019s her fault. you don\u2019t need to apologise, and your family has no business being mad at you for feeling RIGHTLY hurt about a distasteful joke", "Nta, have u told ur families about how hurt u are and its humiliating for exposing this in public?\n\nDoesnt matter if this is 'her day'. Thatll just make her a bully bridezilla. Explain that the one who is making the scene is her not u\n\nA joke is a joke if two parties laughing, u did not. Tell ur family that ur sister laughing AT you, not WITH you.", "NTA. Cut your whole family out of your life.", "NTA. Your family sounds...let's say not nice.\n\nYou did nothing wrong that day, all the best to you.", "NTA.\n\nShit and meatballs, OP, your family sound exhausting.  Really exhausting.\n\nI'd suggest never talking to sister again, and making a simple concise statement to the rest of where you stand and just stonewalling them if they try to make anything more of it.", "NTA. Golden Child knows exactly when to start the water works doesn't she. Funny how she is still so insecure about you that she had to start that disgusting speech and then cry to daddy to pull those strings. An adult woman really? No brain damage at all? Something is sus. I will bet 1000 fake internet points that your sister does hard drugs socially and if your recovery intimidates her like that its because YOU are NOT the addict of\nthe family. Honestly, I'd go scorched earth but I'm probably projecting.", "NTA The only reason she brought you up in her speech was to put you down, not to be 'funny.' I assume she is the golden child by your parents' reaction, and the fact that at her own wedding she immediately had to go cry to daddy just because you told her something she didn't like in private. Unfortunately, it sounds like you need to keep LC or NC with the entire family, for your own mental health and recovery, since your parents will always take her side.", "NTA. Good work on your recovery. It's not easy.", "NTA. You acted way better then I would have I would have walked out right in the middle of her speech and that would embarrass her even more", "You did it better than I would have. I'd have stood and addressed the situation at the time.  She ruined her own wedding. GTFOHWTBS", "NTA.  Your sister and dad suck.  I'm guessing she's the golden child.", "You took her to a private place to talk to her, she started screaming & got everyone else involved. YOU didn't 'ruin' her wedding, she did. \n\nThis was in no way a **joke**, this was deliberate & hurtful jab at you. It definitely wasn't funny!  \n\nMy husband is also a recovering alcoholic, should have died at age 46, needed 4 blood transfusions & a week in the hospital--was told point blank, his blood levels were (direct quote) \"incompatible with life\" and his next drink would kill him. He'd done that much damage to his body. He's been sober for 20+ years now, but he still remembers....\n\nSo, you continue to be \"pissy\" anyway you can! And if \"The Fammmillly!\" doesn't like it.....well, too bad. Their drama is not worth your life. \n\nBest wishes & good luck on your recovery, Stay strong.", "NTA.\n\nCould you have handed it more tactfully? Sure (even though you were quite tactful, in my opinion). But did you need to? No.\n\nWhat you sister said was shitty, and she deserved to be called out (it was nice of you to do so privately).  Also, you parents suck (\"they tell me they don't agree with her but I should 'put up with her' and 'understand her').  No one should have to \"put up with\" or \"understand\" someone who is making light of their addiction.", "I think with your edit i'll say ESH.\n\nI can't really blame you for what you did, but I think the non-asshole move would have been to just leave and address things after the fact.\n\nSuper fucked up what your sister did. Wedding speeches are so not the time and place to make fun of someone for their addiction. I mean, good natured humor is fine, obviously, but this sounds like it was far from good natured.", "ESH. She is by far the main AH of this story, but you aren't blameless either in this. \n\nWas her joke mean-spirited and in very poor taste? That's without question. Were you within your right to confront her about it **privately**, letting her know you felt blindsided and hurt by her making light of a tough time in your life? Of course.\n\nBut right at the end of the speech, while formalities are still going on?? If you needed some space to clear your head and get away, you could have just left and come back and talked to her a little bit later. Effectively dragging someone away from an active event (which they are leading) and in front of 100 people is NOT a private confrontation.\n\nShe certainly stoked the flames, but you let your initial emotions get the better of you and really escalated the situation.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH \n\nYou could have waited til another time to bring it up. It is a sensitive issue and you already highlighted your sister has a shitty attitude towards your recovery.\n\nYour sister sucks too - she is obviously really unsupportive and you didn\u2019t make a scene, you took her privately aside then SHE made a scene about it.", "ESH \n\nYou should have left and spoken to her about this at a later date. She never should have made the comment. You shouldn\u2019t require every venue/event you attend to be dry, and if you are asking for this that leans it more towards you being TAH, but if she did it just to be able to make this joke bit more towards her. \n\nNo matter what it sounds like y\u2019all have a terrible family dynamic, and I can\u2019t help but think that is because your recovery is centered around everyone needing to accommodate your recovery, not you determining your triggers and learning coping mechanisms so your addiction doesn\u2019t keep being something impacting everyone around you.\n\nEta my father is an alcoholic, he battled it for years and has been sober for almost 14 years. It is still HARD for him to be around people drinking, so he limits his time around people who drink/are drinking. My partner\u2019s family LOVES to drink (they are all relatively healthy about it) and they always invite my parents to any gathering they are having. My dad comes, hangs out around the fire pit keeping it going (to give him something to do), eats them the moment it is politic to do so he and my mom are out. It is hard to deal with addictions, but it is your addiction.", "ESH\n\nYour sister was wrong for that type of joke at your expense at the reception in front of others, you are wrong for handling it right then and there instead of waiting until the wedding reception was completely over. I understand how you felt, though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Then get up and leave she would the TA. You letting her know that she hurt you was a fine adult thing to do. If you waited until after the wedding she would still have had the same reaction.
