{"id": 13109, "submission_id": "120zfs2", "title": "AITA for making a scene at my sister's wedding, which she spent more than 10k on, over a joke?", "selftext": "My sister (24f) got married last week. Her wedding was very well planned out- we recieved invitations 6 months before and my sister poured about 10,000$ into this wedding- and that's without catering costs added. She also invited over 100 people- it was an ethnic wedding, so there were some friends of friends.\n\nThe ceremony was beautiful. There were so many pictures taken, everyone was having a great time, I dream of eating the food I ate there just once again in my life. Even the rehearsal dinner a week before was magical.\n\nThe issue came after my sister and her husband said \"I do\"- it was the reception. The cake was cut, and everything was great. They were laughing and having a good time, and then they went back up and said their speeches. Her husband's speech was touching with a humourous twist. When it came time for her to say hers, however, things went south.\n\nShe started off great, making a few jokes about a few family members. Nothing harmful. But then it got to me. She made a joke about considering having a dry wedding because I was \"such an addict\". To clarify, I have struggled with an alcohol addiction, and she is well aware.\n\nShe was never really supportive of my recovery journey because she always saw me as an addict. My sister has this idea that once you struggle with an addiction, you go crazy and lose control if you get the chance again. No matter if you recover or not, in her eyes, you're always an addict.\n\nEveryone laughed and I felt humiliated. She was laughing too and then continued. I didn't want to interrupt her so I just waited. I felt like crying and screaming at the same time, it was a rage yet sadness I'd never experienced before.\n\nAfter her speech, I spoke up. I brought her somewhere private. I told her that I didn't appreciate her joke and it wasn't funny, and that I felt she humiliated me. She got so angry and started yelling, things like \"I have a whole wedding waiting for me back there, who do you think you are to bring me here and waste my time\" and \"It's just a joke, don't be so pissy\". She accused me of ruining her wedding and started screaming. She left back to the ceremony and I just stood there.\n\nOnce I came back, everyone was staring at me and my sister was sobbing in my dad's arms. My dad proceeded to yell at me telling me I ruined my sister's wedding and made a scene. I yelled back and when I noticed a lot of people were watching, I got angry and left.\n\nNow all my family's mad at me and they won't stop sending me texts telling me I should apologize. I don't want to. AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: Based on the comments, I would like to clarify a few things. I think I may be the asshole because once I left and saw my dad, he started yelling at me and I yelled back. If i'd just left, i wouldn't have caused a scene. I also would like to say this is not the first time my sister has made a distasteful comment about my addiction struggles, and my parents excuse her every time. They tell me they don't agree with her but I should \"put up with her\" and \"understand her\". Lastly, the wedding and reception was still going on- I pulled her away immediately after so people were looking at us. I think her reaction was because she was anxious since people were looking and she didn't want to leave such a special moment.", "created_utc": 1679693542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120zfs2/aita_for_making_a_scene_at_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not understanding her reaction, unless some context is missing.", "You didn\u2019t make a scene, you took her somewhere private and told her that she\u2019s hurt your feelings.\n\nNTA \n\nShe sure is an AH though", "NTA. \n\nYou made sure to have expressed your feelings regarding the cruel \"joke\" in a way that would NOT make a scene. \n\nShe was the one who decided to act out in public.", "NTA\nYour sister was way out of line for mocking you for your recovery.  She should have been celebrating it, or at the very least, not mentioned it in public.  She deliberately chose to humiliate and embarass you.  You called her out for it privately, she then chose to make it public by literally crying in daddy's arms in public.  SHE ruined her own wedding.  \n\nA joke should be funny, what she said wasn't.

You owe no apologies but your sister does for humiliating you.", "I'm going to go with NTA.  Your sister got upset that you called her out on her sick \"joke\".  Addiction recovery is no joking matter.  I'm sorry you had to go through that humiliation, especially over something so private.", "Does your sister often have overly dramatic emotional outbursts? Do your parents then coddle her?  Do they usually blame you for things that you didn\u2019t cause? \n\nNTA, she\u2019s lucky you\u2019re not a bitch like me because she would have had wine thrown at her dress on my way out. What she said was more than distasteful, it could have been harmful to you. Honestly I don\u2019t think you owe anyone an apology, they all owe you one.", "So you took her aside, and privately discussed your feelings.

You just talked to your sister in \\*private\\* about her speech.\n\nI'm not giving her a pass about her speech and your struggles with alcohol. I think that was uncalled for, since it wasn't the focus of the wedding.\n\nI feel like your sister wanted to include this in her speech just to make you look bad. She thought she could get away with this since it's her wedding.\n\nRecovering from alcohol is a major accomplishment. You should be proud!", "NTA your \"sister\" shouldn't make light of a serious problem, especially in front of the whole now extended family and friends. You spoke to her privately where she was reactive with anger that suddenly becomes uncontrollable sobbing where she can garner sympathy. She caused a scene and she wants to manipulate everyone into thinking you're the awful one. \n\nHonestly I've cut \"family\" out of my life for less than this. Be proud and stay strong alcoholism is a terrible thing because it's readily available almost everywhere.", "NTA. That shit had no business being in a wedding speech.

Golden Child knows exactly when to start the water works doesn't she. Funny how she is still so insecure about you that she had to start that disgusting speech and then cry to daddy to pull those strings. An adult woman really? No brain damage at all? Something is sus. I will bet 1000 fake internet points that your sister does hard drugs socially and if your recovery intimidates her like that its because YOU are NOT the addict of\nthe family. Honestly, I'd go scorched earth but I'm probably projecting.", "NTA The only reason she brought you up in her speech was to put you down, not to be 'funny.' I assume she is the golden child by your parents' reaction, and the fact that at her own wedding she immediately had to go cry to daddy just because you told her something she didn't like in private. Unfortunately, it sounds like you need to keep LC or NC with the entire family, for your own mental health and recovery, since your parents will always take her side.", "NTA. Good work on your recovery. It's not easy.", "NTA. You acted way better then I would have I would have walked out right in the middle of her speech and that would embarrass her even more", "You did it better than I would have. I'd have stood and addressed the situation at the time.  She ruined her own wedding. GTFOHWTBS", "NTA.  Your sister and dad suck.  I'm guessing she's the golden child.", "You took her to a private place to talk to her, she started screaming & got everyone else involved. YOU didn't 'ruin' her wedding, she did. \n\nThis was in no way a **joke**, this was deliberate & hurtful jab at you. It definitely wasn't funny!  \n\nMy husband is also a recovering alcoholic, should have died at age 46, needed 4 blood transfusions & a week in the hospital--was told point blank, his blood levels were (direct quote) \"incompatible with life\" and his next drink would kill him. He'd done that much damage to his body. He's been sober for 20+ years now, but he still remembers....\n\nSo, you continue to be \"pissy\" anyway you can! And if \"The Fammmillly!\" doesn't like it.....well, too bad. Their drama is not worth your life. \n\nBest wishes & good luck on your recovery, Stay strong.", "NTA.\n\nCould you have handed it more tactfully? Sure (even though you were quite tactful, in my opinion). But did you need to? No.\n\nWhat you sister said was shitty, and she deserved to be called out (it was nice of you to do so privately).  Also, you parents suck (\"they tell me they don't agree with her but I should 'put up with her' and 'understand her').  No one should have to \"put up with\" or \"understand\" someone who is making light of their addiction.", "I think with your edit i'll say ESH.\n\nI can't really blame you for what you did, but I think the non-asshole move would have been to just leave and address things after the fact.\n\nSuper fucked up what your sister did. Wedding speeches are so not the time and place to make fun of someone for their addiction. I mean, good natured humor is fine, obviously, but this sounds like it was far from good natured.", "ESH. She is by far the main AH of this story, but you aren't blameless either in this. \n\nWas her joke mean-spirited and in very poor taste? That's without question. Were you within your right to confront her about it **privately**, letting her know you felt blindsided and hurt by her making light of a tough time in your life? Of course.\n\nBut right at the end of the speech, while formalities are still going on?? If you needed some space to clear your head and get away, you could have just left and come back and talked to her a little bit later. Effectively dragging someone away from an active event (which they are leading) and in front of 100 people is NOT a private confrontation.\n\nShe certainly stoked the flames, but you let your initial emotions get the better of you and really escalated the situation.", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH \n\nYou could have waited til another time to bring it up. It is a sensitive issue and you already highlighted your sister has a shitty attitude towards your recovery.\n\nYour sister sucks too - she is obviously really unsupportive and you didn\u2019t make a scene, you took her privately aside then SHE made a scene about it.", "ESH \n\nYou should have left and spoken to her about this at a later date. She never should have made the comment. You shouldn\u2019t require every venue/event you attend to be dry, and if you are asking for this that leans it more towards you being TAH, but if she did it just to be able to make this joke bit more towards her. \n\nNo matter what it sounds like y\u2019all have a terrible family dynamic, and I can\u2019t help but think that is because your recovery is centered around everyone needing to accommodate your recovery, not you determining your triggers and learning coping mechanisms so your addiction doesn\u2019t keep being something impacting everyone around you.\n\nEta my father is an alcoholic, he battled it for years and has been sober for almost 14 years. It is still HARD for him to be around people drinking, so he limits his time around people who drink/are drinking. My partner\u2019s family LOVES to drink (they are all relatively healthy about it) and they always invite my parents to any gathering they are having. My dad comes, hangs out around the fire pit keeping it going (to give him something to do), eats them the moment it is politic to do so he and my mom are out. It is hard to deal with addictions, but it is your addiction.", "ESH\n\nYour sister was wrong for that type of joke at your expense at the reception in front of others, you are wrong for handling it right then and there instead of waiting until the wedding reception was completely over.

You had it private she made it public, SHE should\u2019ve apologized right then and there but failed to acknowledge your feelings and caused a scene. I\u2019m not telling you what to do, I don\u2019t know your relationship with your sister but to me she sounds toxic and I\u2019d cut her out of my life.", "NTA", "So you didn't respond by throwing a drink in her face....good for you because she would have deserved that. \n\nPlease let EVERYONE know that she was the one who decided to make it public and you were the one who pulled her aside privately. She then decided to make a scene instead of apologizing. \n\nLet these people go. They are not your family. They will continue to hurt you every chance they are given.", "NTA. \n\nI will never understand why people subject themselves to this, in the name of \"family.\"", ">She started off great, making a few jokes about a few family members. Nothing harmful. But then it got to me\n\nIs this a wedding or a Celebrity Roast?  Who makes jokes about several attendees in their wedding speech?\n\nRegardless, she humiliated you publicly and you spoke with her privately.   She's the one who made it a thing.\n\nNTA", "Info: how did it go down when you \u201cspoke up\u201d and told her privately that you didn\u2019t appreciate her joke?", "Esh...you don't sound like a reliable narrator.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry she used her wedding as an opportunity to attack and humiliate you. I promise that many of the guests were cringing at her \u201cjokes\u201d about your struggles with alcoholism, and thought they were in poor taste. She embarrassed *herself*, and she could have easily avoided doing so. You were not responsible for managing her image for her when she was clearly so determined to damage it.", "NTA I think it would have been a lose lose situation. Based on how you described your feelings at the time your only other option would have been yo excuse yourself and you would most likely have gotten shit for that as well.\n\nTruly sorry for your family dynamics, sounds like your parents are enablers and your sister is the golden child.", "NTA- you complained to her privately, she is the one who caused the public scene. Your family is not supportive of your struggle.", "My brother and mother struggle with addiction.\nAny legit family member would not make it a joke unless it is funny on both parts. Nor would they accept jokes on their behalf. That's not being funny  that's making a stab. Your family telling you to basically just deal with it bc it's her way. Yet don't tell her to have some consideration for you  is plainly favoring. NTA. You took her to the side to address a situation and she probably felt you were right and needed to make a scene to play victim .", "NTA. You are a better person than me, you confronted her in private. Me,I would of stood up and said and there you have it folks why I have a drinking problem, a sister that just can\u2019t stop talking.", "NTA\n\nyou spoke to her in private i don't give a damn it was her wedding. she's an AH and so is your family. time to go NC", "NTA. you took the issue privately, kudos to you! Your sister is a BIG A$$, sorry to say that.", "NTA.\n\nHad you known that her reaction would be that I think you would have just left. Dad probably got a sob story.", "NTA, your family sucks though OP.", "That's something all people dealing with an addiction or illness - Shame!!!  But hey, it's the bride's wedding and she can do or say whatever she wants. It must be written in ancient stone somewhere. \n\nNTA. Jokes are only funny when everyone is laughing.", "OP - I am so sorry this happened to you!  You are brave enough to admit you had an issue and you've actively been dealing with it.  What your sister did (and father) is awful.\n\nIf I were you, I would respond to your sister's flying monkeys this way:\n\n\"Can you explain to me why what sister said was acceptable?  Explain the joke to me because I do not understand how this was funny.  Would it have been funny if she had chosen to talk about someone's breast cancer diagnosis this way?  What about someone who is a paraplegic and in a wheelchair?  Or someone who has been permanently disfigured in an accident?  Or a burn victim?\n\nPlease explain to me why this is excusable?  Why is it funny?  In what world is laughing at the misfortune of others funny?\n\nPeople who try to explain away their cruelty by saying it was just a joke deserve a special place in hell.  People that defend the cruelty of others deserve to spend eternity alongside them. \n\nI hope you enjoy the heat!\" Then you walk away, hang up, slam the door and block each and every one of them including your father.\n\nJust because it was your sister's wedding does not excuse her behavior.  She created the problem and it is not up to you to apologize for her being an AH and an idiot.  If she won't apologize to you, then is it really a loss for you?  \n\nIf you don't stick to your guns, especially in regards to your sister and father, then this will give them permission to continue abusing you for dealing with your issues.\n\nThat is not fair to you, the person who is being an adult here and doing the right thing.\n\nBe strong and stay true to yourself.  You are not in the wrong.  You are NTA.", "NTA and you can tell her 10k would barely pay for a picnic wedding where I live", "NTA!  Addiction is a major thing and if you are recovering then that should be applauded and not mocked.  Your sister comes across as very spoilt.  She\u2019s the AH here.  \nYou didn\u2019t create the scene.  This was her doing.", "NTA - i\u2019m a recovering addict with 10 years clean and my sister (2 years younger) has also said some hateful shit to me about it. we don\u2019t have a relationship because she\u2019s the fucking worst, and it\u2019s honestly her loss. you were gracious enough to pull her aside privately and not go off on her in front of all her other guests\u2014i\u2019m not sure i would have been able to do the same.", "NTA. Your sister insulted you in public and you still had the composure to handle it in private. Seems like there is a really negative family dynamic towards you and you not only shouldn't apologize, but consider spending less time/thought on these people. Good luck on your continued recovery.", "ESH. Honestly, you're looking at this in a vacuum, and life doesn't work like that. I'm assuming there is bad blood based on previous history. You need to talk about it like adults (not at a wedding) and either move on or agree to shit up when at family gatherings.", "Nta But I would just cut the whole family off cause that's just sad she thought that's funny cause it's not", "NTA. Your entire family sucks. I am sorry your family sucks. You handled that very maturely. My father was an alcoholic - but he was a person and much nicer than your sober family members.", "NTA but your dad is dirt", "Your sister\u2019s garbage.", "I'm gonna say NTA.  But:\n\n> No matter if you recover or not, in her eyes, you're always an addict.\n\nPretty much everything I read about addiction is that you are an addict for life.  The only difference is if you are in control of your addiction or not.\n\nThat does not mean people get to treat you like crap because you are a recovering alcoholic.  But depending on how you acted while you were drinking it may be that you burned some emotional bridges and that takes time to recover.", "NTA. Just because it\u2019s \u201cyour wedding\u201d what gives you the right to humiliate someone? The scene was made by HER. She screamed, you were quiet. She was sobbing in public, you were calm. Your dad even showed his ass. \n\nIt takes great strength to beat addiction. I\u2019m proud for you. Keep your head high, you were not the AH. Hugs.", "NTA. Your sister used her wedding as a chance to degrade, embarrass & in a way gaslight you just for her own amusement & the attention. Why would you keep anyone like that in your life? The alcohol addiction is  just an excuse because she is clearly jealous of you to the point she emotionally & verbally abused you in front of 98 people & then threw a baby fit for sympathy. Go NC with her & I promise you you will feel a 1000 times better.", "NTA. Your sister ruined her wedding, not you. She really sucks.", "You are so NTA.", "Your sister & those who enable her bullying & cruelty are detrimental to you maintaining your sobriety. Consider going low or no contact. NTA.", "I think your recovery efforts are awesome.  I send my very warmest hopes that you will find peace with it, success, and happiness as you move on into a new chapter of your life.", "NTA\n\nI would cut off my entire family if that happened to me. Your family is wrong. Stand your ground and don\u2019t let them shake you.", "NTA\nIf her wedding was ruined, your sister ruined it. Up to the point when she went crying to daddy it could have been a touching \u201csister\u201d moment for all the guests knew. She escalated things and now she\u2019s upset.\n\nIf you feel you must apologize give her an insincere one \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you feel telling you it was hurtful to call me an addict in front of everyone ruined your wedding\u201d", "ESH this conversation would have kept til after the wedding", "NTA your sister is a HUGE AH! Just another reason why I have weddings", "Absolutely NTA. She wanted to be grandiose and display public humiliation towards sensitive topics about her own family. Her ego got the best of her, and she was too sensitive to deal with the backlash. You may blame yourself for \u201ccausing a scene\u201d but there would have been no scene at all had she not used her speech to throw others under the bus. \n\nAlso.. everyone was staring at only you? That\u2019s baffling, did they expect you to accept being a spectacle for the comfort of someone who just insulted you so deeply? It sounds like she may have spun a different narrative than what actually happened while you were gone, so she could play victim.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t make a scene, your sister did. You took her somewhere private to address her inappropriate joke. She chose to respond by yelling, screaming, and dramatically running to her dad and sobbing in his arms. People were already looking well before you yelled.\n\nI would also like to point out that you wouldn\u2019t have yelled at all if your dad hadn\u2019t started yelling in front of everyone that you \u201cruined the wedding\u201d and \u201cmade a scene\u201d. So he\u2019d actually be the one causing a scene if your sister\u2019s theatrics hadn\u2019t already done so.", "Your sister is definitely TA. Not sure how anyone would justify the crap she said at her wedding with so many familiar friends and family to just belittle you.  No one would blame you if you went NC with her.  You don\u2019t need enemies with family like that.", "NTA NTA NTA.\n\nWhat a shitty thing to do. She was clearly out to hurt or humiliate you, and that makes her a VERY ugly bride.\n\nYou're not wrong here. I'm so sorry she did that, and I'm sorry your family reacted the way they did.\n\nAddiction is no fucking joke. Laughing at (or hating, as your sister seems to do) addicts is shitty in general. I'm sorry. Congratulations on recovery. That's a beautiful and strong thing.", "NTA. Your sister however is a gigantic AH. Your family too for enabling it. This is reading as a golden child scenario. \n\nIf you had been joking about your past that would be one thing because you\u2019re the one who went through it. Any joke like your sister made that was deliberately targeting you struggling with addiction and in a wedding of all places was cruel. Then she has the nerve to get angry that you left. That\u2019s some BS.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re sober now OP. I wish you the best in your continued recovery.", "I just checked and the calendar still says it\u2019s 2023. \n\nSo. I\u2019m surprised that OPs sister didn\u2019t get the memo and thinks that the height of comedy is mocking someone\u2019s addiction like this. And then subsequently thinks that that white dress is the physical manifestation of carte blanche from the universe of \u201cdo what ya want!\u201d", "She didn't though, in her edit she says, she pulled her away immediatly while everyone was still focused on her. That's not privately, just because she stormed the stage after the bride said her last word or pulled her away. This is a very public display and no, definetly not the time or place to blow up! It wasn't the first time, sister did this, so OP should have left or brought it up after the honeymoon. This wasn't pressing or time sensitive.", "Yeah, I was thinking, not one person in fifty would show the kind of restraint OP showed... at least, if OP's story is true and complete.", "Read the text again. You completely misunderstood what was written.", "She didn\u2019t make a scene her sister made a scene. She pulled her aside and spoke privately it wasn\u2019t until she was publicly confronted by her dad that she stood up for herself.", "Golden child vs scapegoat.\n\nYou can tell by how the dad (at this particular incident and in the past) sided with the bride over OP despite the bride being the one to cause the incident.", "Disagree with what?", "Fuck that. I don\u2019t care if you are god himself, if you humiliate someone publicly you deserve to reap the consequences of it right then", "I just wonder how the hell she could even take the time out of a supposedly happy event event to humiliate someone. It must have been hard for OP to get clean, considering his sister and father's attitude.", "Looks like it lol", "I disagree to disagree.", "The sister is definitely TA -- who uses the microphone at your own wedding to make fun of your family?  She sounds like trash.", "The father as well. OP NTA"]}
