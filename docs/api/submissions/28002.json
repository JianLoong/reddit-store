{"id": 28002, "submission_id": "16x1g1e", "title": "AITA for not letting my husband stay in an AIRBNB with his female employees?", "selftext": "My (39F) husband (41M) has a successful online business. He attends a marketing convention every year which is 15 minutes from our house, & this year he\u2019s flying in his 7 remote staff members to attend the conference with him. A few months ago, he asked me what I thought if he rented an Air BNB for him & his staff to stay in, so I said \u201cuhh, I think that\u2019s fine. The only reason I\u2019d be uncomfortable with it is if there were women staying in the house as well.\u201d Well, later that evening, we brought the topic up again, & he said yes some of them are women, so I said no. The conversation was dropped, but then a few months later he says he's spending the night there & that he told me about it. I told him even if he did, that I certainly didn\u2019t remember, because I would have told him again that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. The main reason I\u2019m uncomfortable is because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea legally for him to stay at an Air BNB with female employees (there are two unmarried Fs in their mid-20\u2019s on his staff). The reward doesn\u2019t outweigh the risk of any perceived sexual harassment issues, in my mind. The Air BNB is only 20 minutes away from our own house. He\u2019s able to stay at the house hanging out with them as long as he wants. I just ask that he came home to sleep.\r  \n\r  \nSo the team arrives, everything is going fine, H & his team are going to the conference together, hanging out until all hours in the evening, & then coming home to sleep. H dropped a lot of money for a VIP tour at a major amusement park for the last day, & he wanted me to come too. Two nights before that scheduled outing, I get a fb message from one of his employees (F), asking if I could spend the night at the AirBNB the night before the outing. In the morning, H admits that he told his employees that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with him spending the night, & how about she (the F) should message me to try & convince me. I about flew off the handle. He totally threw me under the bus, & he didn\u2019t even tell them it was because of legal reasons. Also, I saw this as a complete breach in privacy & trust between a H & a W. I write a very nice reply explaining the reason, & she responds \u201coh, I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, makes sense!\u201d. Apparently the next morning, she reads my message aloud in the car with everyone in it (including my H). Which, I\u2019m somewhat glad for (since now everyone knows the reason), but also, how awkward for everyone.\r  \n\r  \nToday is the day of the VIP event. I rearranged my entire schedule beforehand to be able to go to this, & now I just feel the entire thing is so awkward. H is very apologetic about the whole thing, really wants me to go the VIP event today. I know he wants me to go to be with me, but another part of me knows it\u2019s because if I DON\u2019T show up today, then that will & more fuel to the gossip fire among his employees. I just don\u2019t want to be the butt of a joke. AITA in any of this situation? Am I overreacting?\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1696167479, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16x1g1e/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_stay_in_an_airbnb/", "score": 310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s really sketchy and totally crosses a line. You told him your boundaries about staying overnight with female employees, he didn\u2019t respect it by asking them to ask you. NTA and I\u2019d be having strong words with my husband for putting my in that position. Go on the trip, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Husband on the other hand should be feeling awkward.", "NTA - I\u2019ve (25F) attended conventions with my remote team before and if the founder ever suggested this I\u2019d find it weird and quite unprofessional. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019d want to be in that type of environment with my boss. \n\nI think your concerns are valid, especially legally and again, it\u2019s very unprofessional for him to be doing any of this imo.", "NTA\n\nThere's no reason for everyone to sleep in the same accommodation. They're coworkers, not friends.  \nYour husband should at least have rented two apartments : one for the men, one for the women. You're right about your concerns about sexual harassment but also about your jealousy as a wife, even if you don't mention it, it would be understandable.\n\nYour husband screwed up big time. He should never have talked to his employees about his relationship, it's very inappropriate.  \nAnd on top of that, he asked an employee to convince you ? Unacceptable. He's somehow humiliated you and is sharing your private life with strangers.\n\nYour husband didn't take your point of view into account at all and instead of talking to you about it, he asked outsiders to meddle in your relationship's issues... it's a very bad move.", "NTA I think your husband put you in a really awkward spot. Also with this being so close to your home it makes zero sense that he wouldn't just stay home vs the airbnb. He is a middle aged married man with a home and wife down the road.  They are single 20 something ladies. He should've just come home.", "NTA. He needs to be smarter and to get everyone their own hotel rooms in the future. It\u2019s a legal minefield to cohabitate employees overnight in the same space.", "[removed]", "Why in the bloody hell would he have his female coworker message you to ask for his permission? That is sketchy as fuck\u2026what is this high school? Why should and would she want him to spend the night? Is she trying to climb the corporate ladder? And is he actually entertaining this thought?", "NTA\n\nYou got totally gaslit and then thrown under the bus. I'd be more concerned with his insistence on staying in an environment that has very little upside and a ton of downside for his relationship with his wife. You have to ask yourself what his angle is. He's making a lot of choices and none of them are helping you, only making it worse.\n\nNow you have to help him save face?", "NTA. Your husband is a being a shit husband for throwing you under the bus and being a gross boss for putting his employees in that position. \n\n1. Asking and employee to become involved in a marriage by messaging a wife is wildly inappropriate. \n\n2. Renting an Airbnb then trying to stay there when he could stay at home is also inappropriate and creates a situation where any female employee could feel uncomfortable because they are the subordinate in a home furnished by the boss. It created a situation where he has a lot of power and they have little.\n\n3. Your husband didn\u2019t listen when you told him you weren\u2019t comfortable. He then lied to your face trying to convince you that you did say you were comfortable. He then tried to stay there knowing you were not comfortable. He then shared the issue with his employees and even asked an employee to speak to you about it. \n\nYour husband is a scummy person. Please don\u2019t go to the event today and please go stay with a friend or family member or take a little trip to get space and reflect on the situation.", "Umm.. you don't go out of your way to stay at an air bnb with female co workers and then go even further out of your way to get one of them to convince you to be okay with it.\n\nNTA.

Asking a female employee to message his wife and ask if her husband can spend the night borders on harassment. It would have been hard for the employee to refuse. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are the person the employees are going to gossip about. Your husband had an opportunity to look like a leader. Now he looks like a child who wants to be part of the gang.", "NTA but hubby needs a crash course in common sense. You never, ever create a work-related situation where you have men and women sharing the same accommodation. That is an HR nightmare waiting to happen (see my screen name). I've spent my entire career cleaning up after this kind of thing and, even if you get out of it without lawyers, it's expensive, time-consuming and tends to really mess with the balance of a team. One drink too many, one offhand remark, one wrong turn on the way to the loo at 3 am and it's off to the races. I have enough horror stories to write a book, if I ever have time in between cleaning up messes.\n\nSounds like your husband was trying too hard to be one of the gang and forgot that he's the actual boss and business owner.", "How big is this company?  I feel as if there is a sliding scale of what is appropriate as the organization grows in size", "NTA and not even a speck of overreacting.  Your husband messed this up BIG time. I wouldn\u2019t go, he\u2019s embarrassed you in front of them and it\u2019s going to be uncomfortable. I personally wouldn\u2019t do that to myself after what he did. \n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with him? Jeez!", "Nta\n\nYour husband put you in this position to make it sound like you're unstable. That should make you question what his motives might be.", "NTA\nYour husband's behavior throughout this entire fiasco has been childish at best and coercive/manipulative at worst. I wouldn't trust a man who behaved like that - not as an employee nor as a spouse.", "This entire scenario is ridiculous. These are co-workers and presumably adults, not roommates. Let them get their own freaking hotel rooms.\n\nDefinitely NTA but your husband is a moron", "NTA he lives 15 minutes away from the event. Why does he need to stay at an air bnb?", "NTA the easy solution would have been to ask if you\u2019d like to stay at the Airbnb for the entire time with everyone maybe as a mini staycation. If not then respectful your request and stay at home. Instead he totally tried to manipulate and then gaslight you AND bring one of his employees into your private business. I\u2019d have some serious questions about why my spouse would go to such lengths to get what they want and throw you under the bus to do so. Definitely go to the VIP event and have the time of your life! Eat the best food, drink the best drinks and get yourself some really nice souvenirs. Show his employees the amazing and fun person you are.", "YTA. I just can't imagine anyone in this day and age having an objection to men and women sharing an AirBnB, hotel, etc. Especially younger people having this attitude (I'm certain you're younger than me). I've certainly done the same (stayed in mixed housing) for business reasons. \n\nI don't buy your \"legal\" reasons (the company would've thought of that before you did). I think you just didn't want him to stay w/other women.\n\nI think husband getting a co-worker to call you was to assure you it wasn't a big deal. Sounds like she said your points \"made sense\" was because she didn't want to argue with you.\n\nI would go to the VIP gathering and not worry about it.

Also a real dick move to have his employee text you", "ESH. \n\nYour husband obviously for the indiscretion which you're right, is a breach of trust, and his asking a colleague to call you about it. \n\nYou because you sound exhausting.

So many lines were crossed here", "NTA. He is the employer, so there is a power imbalance. If he had an HR dept, they would take him to task for putting employees in this position. Both for lodging them in a residence where they don't have enough secure privacy where there could be a question of improper things happening, and for asking them to convince you to allow him to sleep over. As their supervisor, he has an extra responsibility because their job security depends upon him and they might play along with his suggestions and assure him that they're OK with something that actually makes them uncomfortable. Why is he so darn eager to be over there anyway? Just put everyone in their own hotel room next time, not an AirBNB where they are all sharing a dwelling. That way they all have their own keys and can retreat to a private space with a non-shared bathroom, and the boss and other employees won't be in their sleeping and bathing areas, and problem solved.", "NTA \n\nThere\u2019s so much to unpack here.

If he is openly blurring the lines between his relationships with these women, imagine how much more blurred it can get when you\u2019re not there to witness it?

Why not be honest with yourself and the internet.  You don't trust your husband.", "Husband is an asshole", "NTA that is really unprofessional and I wonder what other inappropriate things he talks about or does with his employees. The fact that a female employee felt comfortable enough to message her boss\u2019s wife and ask what she asked speaks VOLUMES! Most people would laugh it off and say \u201cyeah right sorry boss not doing that\u201d so either your husband has a very inappropriate dynamic with his employees that they\u2019re all part of OR he is abusing his power of authority and making his employees do things they don\u2019t want to do. Either way your husband sounds like a creep show.", "NTA.  You were right about the legal ramifications.  Every time I have traveled for business, we have stayed in hotels.  Two women might share a room.  Two men might share a room.  That's it, and usually, rooms weren't shared.  Once, the hotel had an issue and we needed to relocate.

This whole situation is absurd. The conference is almost next door to your home, so his staying at any AirBNB makes no sense except for partying, and you're quite right that he should not be partying or staying overnight in the same place as his younger female coworkers (and subordinates, apparently). He can have fun with them, say goodnight, and go the heck home (and telling them about your concerns and throwing you under the bus is truly dumb of him).  \nSo... maybe it's time to ask yourself which of these women he finds attractive and would like to get together with or see nude, etc. My guess is the one who contacted you.", "NTA. Because I think it's bad practice to require staff to stay in Air B&Bs. They should be put up in hotels so they can have some down time away from their coworkers.", "NTA\n\nYour husband shouldn't be flying his employees in unless he is also paying for hotel rooms for them. Airbnb is a cheap and gross way of accommodating co-workers.  No one wants to have to get full on dressed to walk to the bathroom or grab a coffee from a kitchen, and it's totally inappropriate for coworkers to have to see each other late at night or early morning before/after bed.\n\nBut you also aren't only worried about sexual harassment. You specifically call out that two employees are single. You realize,  right,  that harassment can happy to any women,  married or not,  young or old?  The real concern here is that you're worried your husband will cheat with one of the younger women. Which can still happen with any woman,  but is more likely to happen with a single woman you perceive as a threat. \n\nYour husband has very questionable judgment. I'm guessing that's the real problem here.", "NTA", "It's 20 minutes away from his house. This is horrible.

It\u2019s not a vacation with friends and family. The most innocent possibility is that your husband has completely disintegrated professional boundaries within his company, but nothing sketchy is going on otherwise. Although that\u2019s the most innocent possibility, I do not think that it\u2019s the most likely.\n\nAgain, I do overnight travel about 25-50% of the time between two different companies, which each had completely different cultures.

He attends a marketing convention every year which is 15 minutes from our house, & this year he\u2019s flying in his 7 remote staff members to attend the conference with him. A few months ago, he asked me what I thought if he rented an Air BNB for him & his staff to stay in, so I said \u201cuhh, I think that\u2019s fine. The only reason I\u2019d be uncomfortable with it is if there were women staying in the house as well.\u201d Well, later that evening, we brought the topic up again, & he said yes some of them are women, so I said no. The conversation was dropped, but then a few months later he says he's spending the night there & that he told me about it. I told him even if he did, that I certainly didn\u2019t remember, because I would have told him again that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. The main reason I\u2019m uncomfortable is because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea legally for him to stay at an Air BNB with female employees (there are two unmarried Fs in their mid-20\u2019s on his staff). The reward doesn\u2019t outweigh the risk of any perceived sexual harassment issues, in my mind. The Air BNB is only 20 minutes away from our own house. He\u2019s able to stay at the house hanging out with them as long as he wants. I just ask that he came home to sleep.\r  \n\r  \nSo the team arrives, everything is going fine, H & his team are going to the conference together, hanging out until all hours in the evening, & then coming home to sleep. H dropped a lot of money for a VIP tour at a major amusement park for the last day, & he wanted me to come too. Two nights before that scheduled outing, I get a fb message from one of his employees (F), asking if I could spend the night at the AirBNB the night before the outing. In the morning, H admits that he told his employees that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with him spending the night, & how about she (the F) should message me to try & convince me. I about flew off the handle. He totally threw me under the bus, & he didn\u2019t even tell them it was because of legal reasons. Also, I saw this as a complete breach in privacy & trust between a H & a W. I write a very nice reply explaining the reason, & she responds \u201coh, I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, makes sense!\u201d. Apparently the next morning, she reads my message aloud in the car with everyone in it (including my H). Which, I\u2019m somewhat glad for (since now everyone knows the reason), but also, how awkward for everyone.\r  \n\r  \nToday is the day of the VIP event. I rearranged my entire schedule beforehand to be able to go to this, & now I just feel the entire thing is so awkward. H is very apologetic about the whole thing, really wants me to go the VIP event today. I know he wants me to go to be with me, but another part of me knows it\u2019s because if I DON\u2019T show up today, then that will & more fuel to the gossip fire among his employees. I just don\u2019t want to be the butt of a joke. AITA in any of this situation? Am I overreacting?\r  \n\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There was absolutely no (good) reason he needed to stay overnight.  \n>  \n>He should not have breached your trust like that. Private conversations between a married couple should not be shared at work, and he did totally throw you under the bus! He absolutely shouldn't have told an employee that you weren't \"letting\" him stay the night, or that she should try to convince you to let him stay. (Btw, this is the one many people would have assumed he's having an affair with or trying to ... until she read the text aloud to everyone! Holy awkward, Batman!)  \n>  \n>So, he invited 5 men and 2 women he employs and had them stay in the same AirBnB, and he wanted to stay with them. That's probably insane to begin with. These remote employees may not even really know each other? What's the actual setup of sleeping arrangements? I mean, if it were basically a hotel, with each person in a separate room (ideally with a locking door for privacy and security), I guess I'd say there's zero problem (just as having separate rooms at the same hotel would be fine, and what most companies do). If it's basically a hostel, that's just horrible. Being forced to share a room with a coworker is usually considered pretty unprofessional (although very low-budget places may do it, asking in advance), and that's when it's a same-sex colleague you already know.  \n>  \n>Go to the event if you really want to.

This can work sometimes with the right people, the right kind of business, the right work culture\u2026but I think the vast majority of the time it\u2019s a bad idea.

There is unfortunately no shortage of stories about work trips where either a guy (or a gal, though I think maybe not as often) shows up at a coworker\u2019s hotel room (usually alcohol is involved) to try to solicit something. At least in a hotel there is security, the ability to lock the door, and the liability for the action is on the offending employee and NOT the employer for putting employees into a forced cohabitation situation. \n\nPutting people together in an AirBnB could be totally fine, and probably usually is totally fine, but again, all it takes is one person one time.

These are accidents that can happen in everyday life, but they can take on huge proportions and ruin your career.\n\nJust because you're not sleeping in the same place doesn't mean you can't spend the whole day in meetings and devote a lot of time to work, which is what the trip is all about.

And they're the only ones who end up getting the promotions. I think of Mike Pence who wouldn't go out for a meal w/a an opposite sex person. If I hadn't had those one on one meals w/an opposite sex supervisors that I did, it would really have hampered my career.\n\nI'm def older than the OP and her husband.

If you don't want a conversation repeated, make sure you specify that. And even then, accept the fact that some people say they won't repeat and will anyway. Heck, the last time I worked in an office (last decade) people routinely came into the breakroom saying \"Boy, you won't believe what my husband/wife just said!\" I'm sure those spouses didn't necessarily want all that stuff shared. But people do tend to complain about spousal behavior. Which I agree can be tiresome; that's why I stopped eating lunch in the breakroom, got tired of the complaints."]}
