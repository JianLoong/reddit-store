Like most, I applied to many companies to start my career at, prior to graduation. However, there was one company (DreamJob) that I really wanted. I had my eye on them since completing my undergraduate degree, applied to their internships 2x, & even previously applied for a position. This time they responded & gave me an offer. While I was weighing their offer against others\u2019, my classmate \u201cEvan\u201d texted me. I was shocked bc there was some bad blood between us due to a previous argument.\n\nApparently, he heard about my offer from DreamJob & he was not happy. They also gave him an offer, which he already accepted. He accused me of being petty by applying there too & for trying to compete with his career interests.\n\nAt first, my response was civil. I congratulated & wished him well at DreamJob. I explained that I hadn't accepted yet & was still exploring my options, but that my intent was never to compete w/ or sabotage other people\u2019s careers as he was suggesting. I also explained how I honestly did not know he had gotten a position, as we weren't talking at the time.\n\nHe responded by saying that I was fully aware of his plans to move to the city where DreamJob is located (which was true) & since they were the best company in that city for our job, he obviously applied there. This led to a few back-&-forth texts between us where I reminded him that I too had previously told him my plans to move there & even explicitly told him that my goal was to work for DreamJob since undergrad. The only difference was that I wasn't the one trying to gatekeep an entire company (or city for that matter).\n\nThings got heated until he told me that he didn't think it was a good idea for me to accept the offer due to our history, as it may cause unneeded tension in the workplace. I was royally pissed & part of me wanted to accept the offer out of spite, but another part told me to move on so I decided to end it with \"okay...whatever man, I have other offers anyway\".\n\nWhen the other offers finally arrived, I was disappointed & underwhelmed. DreamJob's offer was better on every level. I'd be an absolute fool to turn them down for any other offer. And for what? So that I could avoid some guy that didn't like me? After talking with some friends, I decided that it was still in my best interest career-wise to accept the offer, despite the drama. I decided not to inform Evan.\n\nAfter we started, we were assigned to 1 of 4 teams within the company. Luckily. I got my 1st choice. It was also Evan's 1st choice, but he was assigned elsewhere.\n\nAfter that day, he texted me accusing me of sabotaging his career plans, going behind his back by accepting the offer secretly, & pulling strings to get my 1st choice of teams. His girlfriend & other mutual friends also got involved and sent me texts saying that I was being bitter/petty & that I should've looked for another job/be the bigger man.\n\nSo, AITA for accepting?", "created_utc": 1688438706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q2nnl/aita_for_accepting_my_dream_job_despite_being/", "score": 2238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now if you really want to piss him off, go be hugely successful!", "So the \"bad blood\" dates back to early in the masters program (2nd-3rd semester). Evan and I were actually pretty good friends early on in the program. We were partnered together for the first big project in our first semester and worked really well together since our skill sets were opposite yet complimentary. I was impressed by & admired his work ethic, skills, and style, so I was excited to see how we grew our skills throughout the rest of the program.\n\nHowever, toward the end of our third semester, I noticed Evan growing a little more distant. My text check-ins, invites to hang out, and occasional funny memes went ignored. In hindsight, I probably should've taken the hint, but at the time, my university was really pushing mental health awareness coming out of the pandemic and I thought I was doing the right thing by trying to be a friend to someone I thought was showing signs of struggling or needing help.\n\nMy texts and meme-sharing continued, albeit, less and less frequently, in hopes that it would bring a smile or lighten his mood. Whether or not he responded was on him, but I was just trying to be a friend and treat him as such. That is, until the day I received this text from Evan (copy/pasted from text):\n\n\"Dude, just stop already! I thought I was making it pretty clear that we are not friends by not responding, but apparently, you need me to just come out and say it. I can't handle your constant texts or stupid memes anymore. Your sense of humor is childish, immature, and frankly, wholly unprofessional. Like how do you expect to get a career in [this field] if you are constantly mocking [the profession] through memes and [crappy] jokes?!? If you can't take what [this profession] does seriously, then I'm sorry, but you'll never succeed, and I refuse to let you drag me down with you. So, please, just stop trying to talk to me...we're not friends.\"\n\nNow, I admit that I'm not the easiest person to get along with. I can be painfully awkward, pretty shy, and, at times, kind of cynical. To cope, my mind usually defaults to using jokes/humor to disarm awkward situations, which sometimes don't land well or are inappropriately timed. Nothing overtly offensive or anything like that, just kinda cheesy puns or your typical \"dad jokes\". Yes, I often mock or try to make light of things within my profession, but that's just who I am. I do take my profession and the work I do seriously, but I also think it's important to be able to laugh at or mock yourself from time to time. So, none of what he said was totally untrue, and I admit the truth of what he said stung a bit hearing that at the time.\n\nUp until he heard about my offer with DreamJob, we hadn't spoken. Whenever we crossed paths in class or on campus, he basically acted like I didn't exist. He would even leave the room when it came my turn to present final projects at the end of each semester.
