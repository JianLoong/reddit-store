Like most, I applied to many companies to start my career at, prior to graduation. However, there was one company (DreamJob) that I really wanted. I had my eye on them since completing my undergraduate degree, applied to their internships 2x, & even previously applied for a position. This time they responded & gave me an offer. While I was weighing their offer against others\u2019, my classmate \u201cEvan\u201d texted me. I was shocked bc there was some bad blood between us due to a previous argument.\n\nApparently, he heard about my offer from DreamJob & he was not happy. They also gave him an offer, which he already accepted. He accused me of being petty by applying there too & for trying to compete with his career interests.\n\nAt first, my response was civil. I congratulated & wished him well at DreamJob. I explained that I hadn't accepted yet & was still exploring my options, but that my intent was never to compete w/ or sabotage other people\u2019s careers as he was suggesting. I also explained how I honestly did not know he had gotten a position, as we weren't talking at the time.\n\nHe responded by saying that I was fully aware of his plans to move to the city where DreamJob is located (which was true) & since they were the best company in that city for our job, he obviously applied there. This led to a few back-&-forth texts between us where I reminded him that I too had previously told him my plans to move there & even explicitly told him that my goal was to work for DreamJob since undergrad. The only difference was that I wasn't the one trying to gatekeep an entire company (or city for that matter).\n\nThings got heated until he told me that he didn't think it was a good idea for me to accept the offer due to our history, as it may cause unneeded tension in the workplace. I was royally pissed & part of me wanted to accept the offer out of spite, but another part told me to move on so I decided to end it with \"okay...whatever man, I have other offers anyway\".\n\nWhen the other offers finally arrived, I was disappointed & underwhelmed. DreamJob's offer was better on every level. I'd be an absolute fool to turn them down for any other offer. And for what? So that I could avoid some guy that didn't like me? After talking with some friends, I decided that it was still in my best interest career-wise to accept the offer, despite the drama. I decided not to inform Evan.\n\nAfter we started, we were assigned to 1 of 4 teams within the company. Luckily. I got my 1st choice. It was also Evan's 1st choice, but he was assigned elsewhere.\n\nAfter that day, he texted me accusing me of sabotaging his career plans, going behind his back by accepting the offer secretly, & pulling strings to get my 1st choice of teams. His girlfriend & other mutual friends also got involved and sent me texts saying that I was being bitter/petty & that I should've looked for another job/be the bigger man.\n\nSo, AITA for accepting?", "created_utc": 1688438706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14q2nnl/aita_for_accepting_my_dream_job_despite_being/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now if you really want to piss him off, go be hugely successful!", "So the \"bad blood\" dates back to early in the masters program (2nd-3rd semester). Evan and I were actually pretty good friends early on in the program. We were partnered together for the first big project in our first semester and worked really well together since our skill sets were opposite yet complimentary. I was impressed by & admired his work ethic, skills, and style, so I was excited to see how we grew our skills throughout the rest of the program.\n\nHowever, toward the end of our third semester, I noticed Evan growing a little more distant. My text check-ins, invites to hang out, and occasional funny memes went ignored. In hindsight, I probably should've taken the hint, but at the time, my university was really pushing mental health awareness coming out of the pandemic and I thought I was doing the right thing by trying to be a friend to someone I thought was showing signs of struggling or needing help.\n\nMy texts and meme-sharing continued, albeit, less and less frequently, in hopes that it would bring a smile or lighten his mood. Whether or not he responded was on him, but I was just trying to be a friend and treat him as such. That is, until the day I received this text from Evan (copy/pasted from text):\n\n\"Dude, just stop already! I thought I was making it pretty clear that we are not friends by not responding, but apparently, you need me to just come out and say it. I can't handle your constant texts or stupid memes anymore. Your sense of humor is childish, immature, and frankly, wholly unprofessional. Like how do you expect to get a career in [this field] if you are constantly mocking [the profession] through memes and [crappy] jokes?!? If you can't take what [this profession] does seriously, then I'm sorry, but you'll never succeed, and I refuse to let you drag me down with you. So, please, just stop trying to talk to me...we're not friends.\"\n\nNow, I admit that I'm not the easiest person to get along with. I can be painfully awkward, pretty shy, and, at times, kind of cynical. To cope, my mind usually defaults to using jokes/humor to disarm awkward situations, which sometimes don't land well or are inappropriately timed. Nothing overtly offensive or anything like that, just kinda cheesy puns or your typical \"dad jokes\". Yes, I often mock or try to make light of things within my profession, but that's just who I am. I do take my profession and the work I do seriously, but I also think it's important to be able to laugh at or mock yourself from time to time. So, none of what he said was totally untrue, and I admit the truth of what he said stung a bit hearing that at the time.\n\nUp until he heard about my offer with DreamJob, we hadn't spoken. Whenever we crossed paths in class or on campus, he basically acted like I didn't exist. He would even leave the room when it came my turn to present final projects at the end of each semester.

Proof of hostility.", "NTA. Who is this guy to tell you what jobs you can and cannot accept? WTF?\n\nKeep all the texts he sent you! If he starts causing problems for you at the new job, you march right into HR, make a complaint and show them the texts. Don't wait until he makes your life miserable there.\n\nAnd tell all his friends that if they keep contacting you about it, you'll file charges for harassment. Then block them everywhere.", "NTA \nI wish you could show the job that a newly hired employee is trying to tell you not to accept their offer", "NTA. Also, wtf? \n\nIf he wants his career to go somewhere he can pull\nUp his big boy pants, get to work, and *earn it.* You existing doesn\u2019t sabotage him, and he needs to grow up.", "NTA and I am sorry your friend is so in love with you that your presence makes him uncomfortable.", "Dear Evan - you are not a main character in my life.  Good luck with yours,  and I\u2019ll live mine.", "NTA in general, but Y T A for entertaining this conversation with him at all. You should have either not responded, or immediately shut it down with one or two sentences and left it at that. As others have said, beware of him trying to sabotage you in the workplace.", "Who tf does Evan think he is to tell you what to do with your life or not \ud83e\udd23 you're NTA", "NTA.\n\nTake the job. Save all the communication from this person, and bring it to HR/your superior. Then show all the other communications from the other people - He is trying to strongarm you into quitting and acting as if HE is in charge of the company at Dreamjob. And I bet this company would really like to know how one of their new employees is already dropping their name to try and abuse his new position on other new hires.\n\nToxic is toxic and companies need to know when someone does this. Especially the fact he went out of his way to get others involved and harass you too. The fact is the company at said Dreamjob will want to know how you were respectful and how he wasn't right out the gate.", "NTA. Save the conversations, report him to HR for harassment. Do this before he finds a way to sabotage you, because he will. Also, congratulations on getting your dream job!", "OP.\nPlease take this to HR!!\nThis guy is definitely going to try to sabotage your dream job..\nHe will make up stuff. Try to turn colleagues against you and will not stop until you leave or get fired!\nCollect all apps and texts and make a complaint or something so HR knows what he is doing, because this will end bad for you.\nYou are definitely NOT TA.\nYou got a good offer and took it!\nGood luck at this new adventure.\nI hope it will bring you everything you have hoped for.", "NTA.  Stop justifying your choice to this guy.  \u201cI assure you I have better things to do with my time than plan my life and career around you.  I\u2019m sure we\u2019re old and mature enough to be professional at the same workplace.  This is the last I\u2019ll engage on this topic.\u201d\n\nProceed to ignore any texts baiting you until he goes away.  And with anyone else chiming in, don\u2019t even engage.  Repeat as above and treat it like the nonsense it is.\n\nP.S.  Keep screenshots of these text conversations in the event dude cannot behave professionally.  Your HR department should be able to address any ensuing harassment adequately.", "NTA. What a bitter person", "Don\u2019t block him. Bring this up to HR as harassment (having others harassing you, etc) and creating a hostile work env. Yes there\u2019s bad blood between you two, but maintain professionalism and don\u2019t engage beyond professional bounds (aka work specific required communications).", "  \nNTA. This is bordering on harassment. I would consult a lawyer.", "NTA - don't worry, DreamJob is going to see his true, unprofessional colors soon enough. Just maintain your professional attitude and don't bad mouth him (that would make you look bad). Stay positive and go above and beyond at DreamJob, that is the way for you to get ahead.", "NTA.\n\nYour \"friend\" can get over himself.", "NTA, this guy is clueless about how adult life works. Tell him that his messages are being screenshotted and could end up with hiring managers/HR at Dream Job.", "Maybe tell HR, too", "Get HR involved if this continues", "I would save these messages and send to HR (appropriately, act low key and non emotional) IF he ever makes any moves at the job that are potentially an issue.", "I completely agree. NTA and congratulations!", "Congratulations! \nBe careful who you talk to and who will become friends with, find out if their friends with this guy.\n Keep your ear up for any insults or sabotaging your job by this person?", "The OP would do better to never respond to the weirdo and show the messages from him to their own manager.\n\nI hate the advice I always see here saying \"go straight to HR\". No, HR isn't there to mediate between employees. The appropriate person for the OP to speak to initially\\* is their own manager. Or perhaps an assigned mentor if the OP's company does that with new employees.\n\n\\*HR would be an appropriate point of contact if there was unlawful conduct like sexual harassment, racial discrimination and so on, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.", "Yes, this. OP, you made a mistake trying to reason with this loon in the first place. When someone you have little connection to is making unreasonable demands, you don't negotiate. You should have told him the first time he contacted you that your career is none of his business, you won't be taking him into account when making decisions, you expect him to be professional if you happen to work together, the end.", "Sorry meant, don\u2019t block him to at least keep records of what is being said etc", "That isn't actually what a hostile work environment means, but the advice is still good.", "Absolutely agree - OP needs to act to protect himself because this dude is clearly vengeful and spiteful", "Honestly, I dont think he should even show a manager at this stage. Take the screenshots, build up the portfolio, have evidence in case he tries something. You don't wanna be new in your industry and get an instant reputation for drama, even if you're not the one starting it.", "Based on this comment, the dude seems pretty stuck up...\nDon't blame yourself, OP.\nEven if he was annoyed, he could've sat you down and talked things over like a normal person instead of looking down on you and being condescending...", "My first thought.   OP should document all the interaction to date.   Continue to do so.\n\nAlso, never speak to Kevin or be alone with him.    Don't give him a chance to make up stuff.  All communication should be in a form that can be documented, email or text \n\nIf he wants to \"talk\" do it only in the presence of your management, or at least 2 other people.  Record any conversation if it's legal in your state.   Don't tell him. \n\nKeep as far away as possible and have as little interaction as possible.", "You need to do exactly this.", "On the other hand, maybe the OP should do nothing, because as a very junior employee with zero capital at work, he is far more likely to sabotage his own career than the OP's.", "I\u2019d agree with you if not for the overwhelming volume of written evidence OP has to prove his case.", "I have absolutely no clue what led the commenter to thinking that lol.", "OP is a man"]}
