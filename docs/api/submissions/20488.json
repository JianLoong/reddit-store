Also I always have to tell her in advance. I have one glass, two cups and three plates I can use. While she uses everything, including the dishes I use. Every Sunday she'd bring her children, inlaws and their children as well, for lunch and they'd stay a couple of hours. And every time I wanted to eat I'd have to wash the dirty dishes they used. Sometimes she would also take the only chair I have in my room if one of them didn't feel like sitting on the couch.\nThis all bothered me, but not that much, so I stayed quiet.I'm in a hard place financially and have been for my entire life. She knew that and maybe event took advantage. \n\nThe bigger problem started when she neglected her dog(Lara).\nLast month she said she's going on vacation on June 1st. I thought she'd either bring Lara with her or leave her with some family until she gets back. But she left the dog alone in the apartment for 14 days. Her son came once every day to walk her and give her food. But Lara still shit all over the apartment. Every time I came home the smell was unbearable. I also couldn't open the window in my room since it leads to the balcony, with shit all over it.\nI couldn't cook anything either. Her son never cleaned the apartment, just took the dog outside for an hour. One day I lost it. I cut my arm at work and had to get stitches. I just wanted to get home and lay down.  Then I saw the dog got diarrhea because her diet was changed, and that it was all sitting there for hours or days. I took my phone out and filmed the apartment, zooming in on everything, and sent it to my landlord with a caption: \"Since the apartment looks like this and I have no time to clean it, but I also can't live here when it's like this, I'll be staying somewhere else for a couple of days. Just so you know.\" \nI immediately started looking for other places to move and when I found one I called her and said I'd be moving out on June 30th. It was June 15th when I told her.\nThen she started calling me rude for sending her \"that kind of video\" while she was on vacation. I told her that kind of video is what your apartment looked like while you were not there. \n She told me I need to pay her rent again because I told her I'll be moving out 15 days in advance instead of the whole month. She also won't give me my deposit back, even though I never broke or damaged anything or brought someone without asking or broke any other rules we made. And while she agreed I followed all the rules, she still demands the money. \nSo AITA for not giving her the money or is it reasonable why I left so quickly?", "created_utc": 1687634294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i144w/aita_for_not_giving_my_landlord_money/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the least you deserve privacy. This sounds like such a toxic situation. Anyone would be frustrated having to come home to feces. I\u2019d say just call it a lesson learned and move on.

I don't know if you'll be able to get out of paying her legally, but I sure hope you do! Sounds like she has no grounds to hold the deposit. It also sounds like she was generally disrespectful to you which sucks.", "INFO: Do you have a signed lease, what was the amount of your deposit, and what state are you in? \n\nTenant laws exist for a reason. Most states protect the deposit. She has 30 days to give it back, but you NEED to give her your new address in WRITING. Once you have it in writing, take her to small claims court and you have a 100% chance of winning. It costs anywhere from $75-150 to submit a claim, but it\u2019s worth it if your deposit was hefty. However, if you don\u2019t have a lease, this is no longer the case. If you do not have a lease, don\u2019t give her any money. Move out your expensive belongings so she can\u2019t steal it when she returns.

I don\u2019t know why are you put her for this long. Don\u2019t give her any more money.

That's horrible living conditions.", "NTA. She can take her rent out of your security deposit. Good riddance.", "INFO: Are you (legally speaking) a full tenant or a flatmate? If you're a full tenant, did you sign a legal tenancy agreement? And does that agreement have any clauses about terminating a lease with shorter notice for certain reasons?\n\nBecause really what she can LEGALLY demand of you, and what you can LEGALLY do when you leave (as in, whether you can withhold rent or really do owe her for the month) depends on your lease contract. Flatmates often has lesser protections but can leave easier, tenants often have to pay the notice period (or if a fixed lease, either the whole lease period or until a replacement is found). \n\nIt doesn't really matter who the asshole is, it depends who is legally right or wrong.
