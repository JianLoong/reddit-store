It\u2019s a pain in the ass and people are often inconsiderate, leaving trash or lurking in the shadows so that scared homeowners call cops for help. One dude had a gun with him and got belligerent saying he\u2019d always been allowed to by the last owners. It\u2019s not stuck up to have a policy not to let people use your dock. You saw one kid ask (who wasn\u2019t kept from fishing even without access\u2026) but are you going to be there to police the requests from all the other renters to come after?  You were very rude to do this.", "I mean, technically it wasn't your call, but I say NTA because you were nice to the polite little kid. I approve of this small rebellion.", "NTA they're hypocrites and they didn't say no because of liability, otherwise they would've said so instead of going \"but it's MINE I don't want him to use MY pier\"", "Info: where were the boy\u2019s parents? \nAs of now, I\u2019ll go with NAH.

Even so, just because someone is legally *right* does but mean they can\u2019t still be an asshole. In this case, the in-laws have the right to determine who can and cannot use their property but the decision they made to flat out deny a child\u2019s simple request and the air of elitism they seem to possess is definitely assy.  And I don\u2019t buy these \u201cliability\u201d arguments. If that was they\u2019d concern, a simple 5 minute convo with the neighbor kids parents requiring them to supervise could\u2019ve taken care of that. They didn\u2019t want the kid to use their pier plain and simple. That\u2019s their prerogative but it doesn\u2019t grant them immunity from being judged as jerks.", "Dang!

MY stuff is off limits to YOU because it\u2019s MINE!\u201d I think that\u2019s more my qualm than anything else.

Thanks!", "You think being judgmental of the in laws for no good reason makes her a good person? It\u2019s easy to be generous with someone else\u2019s money and property. It\u2019s silly of her to point out their attitude of helping neighbors being good but saying no here - this wasn\u2019t a neighbor. The spot next to them is a rental which means strangers coming and going week to week.

That\u2019s not stuck up. That\u2019s often a common sense safety measure or way to avoid problems from entitled or unreasonable people. That\u2019s one kid on this day, how many other people do you think would love access to a lakefront for recreation? People who have homes near resorts or water or tourist cities often have to be more stringent with allowing people to visit and use their stuff because it gets out of hand fast."]}
