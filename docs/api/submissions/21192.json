And I don\u2019t buy these \u201cliability\u201d arguments. If that was their concern, a simple 5 minute convo with the neighbor kids\u2019 parents requiring them to supervise him while fishing could\u2019ve taken care of that.

Them not wanting a kid to fish off their pier has nothing to do with them being stuck up.
