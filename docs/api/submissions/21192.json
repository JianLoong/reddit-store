Liability.  \n\nYou keep saying it should have been OK since you were there watching him is just crazy.  Things cam go sideways in an instant.  I\u2019ve been around water, docks, boats my whole life.  We were all taught how to swim at very early ages, yet there were always rules concerning any kids who came to play with us.  No kids allowed on the dock without a life vest on.  You did not know this child.  You did not know his level of swimming ability.  Anything could have happened, even with you close by.  \n\n2.  Dock Use Permission\n\nBy you giving him permission to use their dock, this could be interpreted by his vacationing family that the dock was open for their use as well.  Believe me, it happens all the time.\n\nWe moved to our dream retirement home on the lake.  We have the longest dock in the area.   We had a lot of work crews here, fixing things. A few times they asked if they could fish off of the dock.  I said sure.  They fished.  A week later, on a Sunday, a car pulled up in our driveway and one of the workers said he was bringing his family to go fishing.  Off our dock.  We gave permission, right?  They had the whole family there - kids, grandparents.  They had coolers filled with their lunch.  Off they go, down to the dock where they spent the entire day hanging out.  I was speechless.  \n\nWe also learned to not let vacationers from the vacation rental house next door come over and use it.  We did that at first.  Learned the hard way that once you give strangers permission, some will take it and run with it.   The other kids want in.  The parents were out there as well.  Their visitors would come over to hang out on our dock.  They are taking our kayaks out.  The dads came by and fished every day very early in the morning.  Some people were nice and respectful, others took it as an extension of their vacation and abused the privilege.   So no more.    \n\nOP, YTA.", "You don't seem to get it.
