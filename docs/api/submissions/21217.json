I was too hot, I didn't understand what was going on and I couldn't find anyone. I was all alone. I had to unbuckle myself and roam around until I found people. It was not a nice experience. What they're doing is shitty and neglectful!", "NTA \n\nYes you should have said before moving him but they didn't leave any choice - they would have said no anyway!\n\nI think it is unkind at the least and negligent at worst. If they can't cope with their toddler it is very worrying that they have had another child. \n\nThere may be a more serious question here of if the parents are neglecting their toddler by taking him to the car for naps and leaving him alone there - should the family step in to care for the children. It worries me what else is going on that you don't see.", "This is why you are NTA\n\nJust Google there are plenty to choose from\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2022/06/21/us/5-year-old-hot-car-death-houston/index.html\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/fridley-car-fire-girl-dies-roberto-lino-hipolito-charged/\n\nEdited to correct a link", "NTA - and honestly, if their driveway is visible to any of the neighbors, I\u2019m am pretty appalled no one has reported them yet.  \n\nAnger is the appropriate reaction.  This is 100% neglect.", "NTA . BESIDES the obvious death issues... What would that do if they went to get him and he was gone? It happens far more often than is spoken about.", "On top of that car seats are not meant for babies to sleep in and are inherently dangerous on their own due to the positioning of the child.", "My sister goes to homicide cases as part of her job (so she's familiar with death scenes) and the worst one she ever went to was a kid killed when he was left in a hot car.  She actually took a transfer to take a break from homicides for a while after that.  She said the Dad was begging the responding police officers to kill him.", "Just don't put your car in the garage with it running because of fumes getting into the car.\n\nI didn't even think about that possibility because I would leave the garage door up & figured the fumes would just blow out the door directly behind it, until I got told that someone came to check on me & the garage reeked of exhaust fumes.", "The difference here is you didn't leave. You were right there. \n\nAnd also, the door wasn't closed. \n\nI have sometimes been with you in Camp Oh God Please Sleep. The struggle is real. A car nap with a parent in attendance is not leaving a baby in a hot car.", "You\u2019re not wrong but the child in question is a 2yo", "That is some manipulative DARVO shit.  If there is ever a time to be angry it\u2019s when parents are being flippant with their child\u2019s safety.", "Have you tried talking to her after the initial anger though? Maybe bringing it up again once you've both had time to cool off and reset would be a good idea? \n\nWrite out all the points about how unsafe it is and approach it more like a teaching moment instead of a judgement moment. (Even though I'm in total agreement with you, I've just taken a lot of crisis deescalation classes)", "I would have thought the same thing. Thanks for the tip.", "Flat skull happens with most infants at some point because on their back is the safest way to sleep. Parents shouldn't fear it. Fear of flat skull ends with parents putting infants to sleep on their stomach which is way worse than a temporarily flattened skull.\n\nThat said this kid is 2 and not in a bucket seat so flat skull isn't an issue anyways. It's unsafe for so many other reasons.", "Aaah I think you're right.  I genuinely got so pissed.", "[deleted]", "Ffs. Just help her develop healthy habits.  She's lucky to have a supportive family and calling CPS is only going to stress out an already stressed mother even more.", "2 years old is the perfect age to wake up, try to get out, not be able to unbuckle themself and become strangled in car seat straps. Call me paranoid. I\u2019m a peds er nurse and I see potential accidents where other people don\u2019t.", "CPS is on the harsher end of the scale (only if the temperature is acceptable and they park off-road very close to the house), but would you rather OP didn't do or say anything and the poor kid died?", "Yeah leave your kid in the car during the hottest point in the entire year. FYI leaving the windows down still has car tempatures in the 80s and 90s. Don't be a parent if you can't follow common sense to be a good one."]}
