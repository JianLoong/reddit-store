I am engaged and getting married in a couple of months. I have known the kids and dated my fianc\u00e9 since our 5 year old was 1. Over two years ago the kids moved in with me and live with me and my fiancee full time. their dad only sees them about once every month. The kids go to school in our boundary school, and my fianc\u00e9e has primary placement. Between me and my fiancee we have taken on all of the responsibilities to raising our kids and their dad contributes nothing. \n\nTheir dad has an open invitation to come pickup the kids every Sunday. However, we hardly hear from him and he does not see them as often as we would like.\n\nThe part where I am wondering if AITA: on the days he wants to see the kids, he comes to pick them up. Every time, he knocks on our front door, and then comes inside even though the kids are fully ready to go shoes on and everything. He usually spends 5-10 minutes talking in the foyer and then they go on their way. When he returns with the kids, it is essentially the same thing, except he stands in the foyer and gives a long drawn out, emotional goodbye. He doesn\u2019t try to move things along and it\u2019s awkward to me that I have to be the one to encourage the kids to \u201csay goodbye\u201d and move on with our day and allow him to leave. Occasionally the kids want to bring him upstairs and show them a new toy or something in their bedroom. \n\nI am uncomfortable with this. I don\u2019t like the idea of my fianc\u00e9es ex coming into my house and in personal areas such as our upstairs. I vocalized to my fianc\u00e9e this and she agrees, but she doesn\u2019t want to make things in unnecessarily difficult for the kids so has taken no action on it. I understand. But\u2026\n\nThe other day, after he dropped of the kids, after another long drawn out goodbye, I told the kids to head upstairs and get their pajamas on. I walked outside with their dad and suggested that instead of him coming inside every time that he say all of his goodbyes from the car. I said this with good intentions and implying that he deserves a good, and private goodbye with his kids without me or my fianc\u00e9 lingering around. I suggested once he is done with his good bye, the kids can walk up to the steps and wave when they get inside. To me this makes things easier on everyone and I don\u2019t have to have my personal boundaries violated. \n\nHis only response was that he doesn\u2019t get to see them much and that he didn\u2019t realize it was a problem bringing them up to the door. (Reminder he has the opportunity to see them every week but he never does).

I unfortunately have this happen way too much to friends and family where the non custodial parent has committed assault or displayed violent/verbal abuse  behavior as soon as they enter a home with and without any prior history. Typically for child services they do note as safety tip and/or for your comfort level to meet children outside and you personally bring them inside.\n\nHowever, this is a conversation your wife needs to have with the kids father. And loop in a lawyer and getting an amendment to the order if there is an issue.", "NTA for how you feel, at all. \n\nI'm approaching this as someone who co-parents with an ex and their new wife. We have a designated spot that is not anyone's home but a public place, where we meet for exchanges. I think that's pretty common? \n\nNow, sometimes, the new wife will come to pick up my child from my house. I don't have a problem with this as it is easier on the kid (doing battle only once with car seat, not having to haul things from one car to another, getting more time actually with me rather than in the car with me driving, and so on). But the new wife is not allowed in my house, just as I would not expect to go into their home if the situation was reversed. We say our hellos and goodbyes at the front door. We might chat for a few minutes. If my kid wants to show something like a toy or a drawing to their step-mother, they just bring it to the door. \n\nAnd the thing is, the adults involved in the situation understand this and we work together to get over any awkward bumps that might arise. It's weird that the biodad does not seem to get that in your case. But you're not an asshole, or doing a disservice to your future step kids by setting a boundary that you aren't comfortable with him being in your home. I don't think you even said that, you just aren't comfortable with him lingering a long time. \n\nI also know it can be hard to say goodbye, and that sometimes it can take awhile. But I think you're being very reasonable with what you're saying, and you shouldn't have to make all the compromises and adjustments.", "NTA. I think this is a performance on his part. You should put the kids first but you don't have to let this person in your house on the off chance it might be better for them this way. No way to him going upstairs. I'm thinking of my parents when I say that and it grosses me out to even think of letting my dad into my mom's house.", "INFO: Does he actually \\*do\\* anything other than take longer than you would like to say goodbye, go see something that his kids have invited him to see, breathe and exist? Unless there is something else going on, I don't see why the whole 'he steps inside our house' is such an issue. \n\nAnd you just spent two paragraphs explaining that you don't even want the man's presence in your house so don't rework it now to make it seem like you are being concerned for HIM and his goodbyes. \n\nAnd this is the kids' home, too, right? Barring their father being abusive, nasty, a thief, etc., why shouldn't they be able to show them a favorite toy, etc.\n\nThe 5-10 minutes each time doesn't seem like a hill to die on to me. Barring additional information, I'm going with YTA.", "NTA", "NTA. He has no right to be on your property seeing your kids. He wants to have his below bare minimum contact with the children he donated DNA to AND encroach upon his ex and your personal space. No. Keep him on the sidewalk. Keep boundaries in tact.", "At the kids ages - YTA. \n\nYou seem to be more concerned about him being \"fianc\u00e9e's EX\" than being their daddy. \n\nMaybe it's time to start thinking about what's best for those kids, and less about how having her ex around makes you uncomfortable. He's not being inappropriate, you're just uncomfortable with the evidence that she has a past.", "NTA. When I was a kid, I\u2019d have HATED what he does.  An adult being upset about saying good bye is awful for kids.  It sounds like he is putting on a show for you and your fianc\u00e9e. The kids are going to see through this soon.  It may not be a good idea for you to be the one YO put a stop to it, but I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to.  He sounds like a\u2026challenge.", "I can\u2019t get onboard with thinking you\u2019re the AH because you don\u2019t want to entertain your fianc\u00e9s ex putting on his part time dad performance. \n\nJust because he doesn\u2019t utilize the time with his kids isn\u2019t your problem - the only caveat is that if the kids do want to show him something on their rooms you should acquiesce because their lives will be better if they feel the grownups get along. \n\nBut dude doesn\u2019t need to post up in your house otherwise.", "YTA. He belongs to those kids. Think of him like a pet that is allowed limited access to the house. Let him in. He can see their rooms, he can talk to them, but then he goes back outside. \n\nThe kids want him there. They love him. He\u2019s not going to poop in the floor so let him be there for a little while. \n\nIf it went in for hours and disrupted your life, I\u2019d understand. He doesn\u2019t sound like the best father. Your concern is noted. Even so, he\u2019s their\u2019s. Accept it.", "NTA even with the kids bringing him to their rooms he should be considerate of you guys and tell them to bring whatever they want to show to him. And fifteen minutes is actually a long time to be saying goodbye and it sounds like he\u2019s just trying to be a busy body by insisting on coming inside. My ex-husband did this and literally put his feet up on my table. I never once set foot in his place uninvited, it\u2019s not hard to respect people\u2019s privacy, doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s the dad, doesn\u2019t mean he gets an open door, it\u2019s not his home.", "YTA. I understand why you don\u2019t love having him come upstairs, but his kids want him to see their rooms. That can be a big deal to kids. Isn\u2019t what makes them feel good and connected to their father (who is definitely an AH for not seeing them more) more important than your vague feeling of unease?   \n\n\nOf course, if he\u2019s snooped or done something else upstairs that gives you specific reason to distrust him, that\u2019s a different situation.", "NTA\n\nHe has zero business coming to your house, especially going upstairs. You have every right to this boundary. He can say his goodbyes from his car.\n\nETA: OP, you're getting REALLY weird responses,  there have been similar posts here before, and they would've all faired you not T A. You could try the stepparenting sub on here, you'd get more sound advice to what you can actually do to stop this.", "YTA. \n\nTry thinking of him as the kids' father and not your SO's ex. Walking kids to the door is normal.  Kids showing dad their room is normal.  Don't make it more than it is.  \n\nWhen the adults get along,  kids feel safe. Gift that to your stepkids.", "You are a mid level AH.  It\u2019s 10 minutes on the pick up.  I\u2019m a child of divorce that was bitter.  It would have changed a lot for me to see my parents talking about the weather for 10 minutes. The goodbye thing is weird I get. But another 10 minutes isn\u2019t going to kill you.  If you don\u2019t want him going upstairs, that\u2019s understandable.  But he isn\u2019t hurting anyone by lingering inside. It\u2019s just an annoying inconvenience for you.  But it\u2019s important for the kids \n\nFather might be a bigger one for not seeing the kids every chance he gets. But you seem to be the bigger person. So just suck up 20 minutes for the kids", "NTA. He really doesn't need to come inside. I would probably keep the door locked when he is coming, he can say good bye on the porch or in the car as you said. Yes, that means he will need to knock for you to let the kids in, but if he can't abide by a polite request you don't have much other choice.", "I kind of get the discomfort with having him upstairs  in the private areas of your home. I think you\u2019d be NTA to set that boundary. Have the kids bring the toy downstairs if they want to show it off. He may be their father, but it\u2019s your home. \n\nAs for the foyer, I feel you\u2019re kind of out of line there. It\u2019s a foyer. It\u2019s as close to being outside the house as you can get. Other commenters have pointed out, if you can keep this civil it will be best for the kids. So tune him out, walk away if you have to, while they say their goodbyes. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA\n\nYou are jealous. And it shouldn't be a problem that he's just chatting them up before he leaves. Your fiancee didn't want to stop him because it makes things easier but you do realize the kids will notice the change and as they get older, they will realize YOU are the one with an issue with their dad. He's literally doing nothing but talking to his kids, not even his ex. This is gross.", "NTA. You\u2019re setting a boundary OP. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting healthy boundaries. Consider going to the library for books that will help you to explain to the children, too.", "NTA\n\nThe dad has plenty of opportunity to see his kids but chooses to not see them as frequently as he pretends to want.\n\nHe does not have to step into the house to say goodbye.  The porch is fine.  \n\nI take it he has a house himself.  Would he be happy if the OP came in and spent time in his lounge and making out he wasn't too keen on leaving.  And the kids could say that dad has a new picture/toy in the house and want to show the OP if he picked up the kids and he may not want the OP to just come through his house.\n\nThe issue doesn't seem to be so much about about bringing them to the door. It's the coming in and hanging around inside the OP's house.  He can spend two hours saying goodbye to the kids in the car if he wants to.  He could even do that on the street.  But he's actually coming inside the house where he actually has no right at all.  Same applies to the OP's wife if she was dropping their kids off to him.  She doesn't have a right to walk into his house and stay there.", "Even if he had the kids 50/50 and was a present parent there is no reason for him to come into the home if you and your fianc\u00e9 aren't ok with it. I think this needs to be a conversation she has with him and the kids. \n\nIf they want to show him something they can bring it down/outside. They're fairly young so it's time to set this precedent. \n\nIt's perfectly fine setting a boundary in your home.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAfter a divorce, exes of whatever gender should not be trying to push their way back in. And OP's house is his castle. If he doesn't want the ex inside, that's it. The ex can make his long-drawn-out farewells outside.\n\nAnd why is he hanging around OP's house JUST AFTER having seen the kids that day? This is some sort of stunt to weasel his way into a marriage that he resents, and I doubt his ex-wife wants anything to do with him, either.\n\nAnd she should stop hiding behind the furniture and join her voice to her husband's.\n\nThis intrusive behavior of an ex, when it isn't banned by BOTH parents, is often the reason why second marriages fail. The ex may not be trying to sabotage this family that leaves him out, but he may do considerable damage even so.", "Nta. Your request is perfectly reasonable.", "Nta. If it continues, keep the door locked. Let the kids knock on the door to be let in. You can stop him coming in.", "No matter what the issue is.  If there are kids involved that are not yours, \n\npeople will make you the asshole.  There is no winning.\n\nNta\n\nBut you will never win.", "YTA.  Bio dad may suck, but the kids seem to enjoy every moment they get with him and are excited to show off their rooms/home/toys to him.  If you can't suck up an extra 10-20 minutes with this guy every 2 weeks for the sake of the kids, who by your own admission has done nothing worse than lingering awkwardly, then you are not ready to be a successful co-parent.  It's not about what makes you or their mom or their dad comfortable, it's about what is best for those two little kiddos.", "NTA, your house.", "I was thinking nta until I read OP's responses to the comments.  If you really can't stand him in your house, take the kids and meet him somewhere halfway between your residences. I traded my daughter to my ex at the bookstore for years. It was kind of expensive buying her a book every time he didn't show, but he behaved a lot better in public. Maybe you'd feel better in public, too.\n\nYou could also leave the ex relationship to your fianc\u00e9e.", "YTA and sound pretty dang insecure. What he's doing doesn't sound unreasonable and is more comfortable for the kids than having to stand outside or sit in a car to say goodbye. You say it doesn't happen often? Then don't get your panties in a bunch. Have your wife stand there. Or let your kids stand there with their dad and you be in the next room.", "YTA. You are acting from a place of jealousy and insecurity. Even if you are a great step-dad, this is the kids bio-dad: he will always be on a pedestal in their eyes (until they are older and figure out all the adult's flaws for themselves). Kids are very perceptive, even if they don't understand all the details, and they *will* pick up on how you treat their dad. This will both be a mark against you and a source of distress for them. It is better for the kids that their parental figures are stable and get along. You sound a lot like a dog pissing on the corner to mark his territory. Be the better person and be gracious.", "ESH. Yes, it\u2019s your house but those are his kids and you invited your fianc\u00e9 and her children there. As such, it\u2019s also their house too. I bet those kids would want their dad to come in but because they are young, you aren\u2019t considering their feelings. If you can\u2019t deal with him being in your life, don\u2019t marry the kids mother.", "YTA \n\nThey are small children. He is their father. It's a few minutes. It's their home, too.\n\nPS. The children can, and do, love both of you.", "ESH - if it means that much to you, go wait outside with the kids a minute before he arrives and then you go pick them up from outside.", "YTA and super defensive on your comments did you want perspective or a pat on the back? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re being legit but even you said it\u2019s once a month and not as often as you\u2019d like but can\u2019t even extend basic curtesy when he does show up so why do you think he\u2019d ever try to come more. Just be the bigger person for the kids", "Neither of you are the AH. Regardless if you want to or not, you\u2019re now coparenting. Ask him to wait to be invited in, instead of just walking in. Build a relationship with him. I\u2019m not saying be his friend but you\u2019ll be able to come to understandings a lot easier in the future if there is a coparenting relationship.", "NTA there is no reason for him to enter your house, and you told him so in a very polite and respectful way.  He isn't being an ass with entering the house since he isn't pushing himself in...he is an ass for not seeing his kids very often.", "YTA. You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing, whether you like it or not he\u2019s their father.", "ESH kids who grow up with happier co-parenting relationships will be happier kids. Just leave the area so you don't deal with it.  We're talking 5-10 minutes on the rare Sunday he comes. 20 maybe Max once a month?  Even every Sunday isn't that much for their father.", "NTA. You have a right to express/enforce your boundaries and this is not an abnormal request.", "Nta.  Just establish a clear boundary.  You're being kinda wishy washy with it.", "YTA - Build bridges; don\u2019t knock them down.", "Ehhh   I have sympathy here, my coparent is a lingerer, he stays too long, invites himself into my house and makes himself at home despite numerous conversations.\n\nThis just sounds normal to me, he in the entry way is that really a hill to die on?", "YTA.", "YTA. Let the man say goodbye to his kids. If it bothers you, don't stand around watching it.", "NTA \n\nIgnore the he's the dad he can do anything he wants bs. I went through this myself and it is insulting, disrespectful and rude. \n\nAlso, If being the dad matters, he would be taking care of and seeing his kids the way he should be.", "YTA. Stop being an asshole. Get ahold of your jealousy and insecurities. There\u2019s no reason for it.", "NAH \n\nI think it's a reasonable request. I also don't think he is purposefully being malicious, unless from now on he continues to violate your request", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries about your home, and I don\u2019t think his response was meant to invoke any guilt.\n\nEDIT: While I still think it\u2019s ok if you can\u2019t handle having him inside your home at all, I do agree with the commenters saying it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for him to linger around the entrance. Unless he\u2019s saying things like \u201cMOM doesn\u2019t let me see you more\u201d, he\u2019s not exactly doing anything malicious.", "ESH\n\nHe should spend more time with the kids, but you could have handled this better.\n\nFirst, you need to remember that you might think of it as your house, but it is also the kids' home. \n\nWhen the ex comes to pick up the kids, a bit of small talk is pretty much expected - the weather, the plans for the day, things the kids might need while they're gone, how the local team did in last night's game, etc. Some of this will be an exchange of information while some will just be an attempt to be polite. \n\nWhen he brings the kids home, bringing them up to the door is just being protective of them. If the kids want to show him something, they can bring it downstairs in most cases and ask permission to bring him upstairs if it is something they can't bring downstairs (ex.: a new bed). If he lingers a bit too long, just tell him you've got to get the kids to bed, get back to something simmering on the stove, or some similar excuse. He'll get the message after a few such excuses.", "YTA but softly. Firstly, to give credit where credit is due, you have done a wonderful job raising these children and it's clear that they come from a loving home.\n\nI absolutely understand that your home is your safe space and you are entitled to feel positive in your own home. That being said, this is also the kids' home too, and they are too young to understand most things which you understand. They are excited to see their part time parent and want to maximise the time with him.\nThe kids are the priority in this situation, and they need to see situations whereby all parental figures involved interact positively and co-parent together. They need to see that it is healthy for people to divorce/split but remain on civilised terms. The kids need to feel secure in knowing that they won't end up in a situation where the adults may argue.", "YTA \n\nYou give steps a bad name. Believe me, those of us that have had the bad ones because of attitudes towards our other parent...we don't forget it. Your fight, anger,  disgust, frustration, or whatever emotion you feel about the ex or the other is yours. It's not the kids issue, don't make it one. And at their age, they'll soon sense and figure out your emotions and start questioning it. \n\nIf it really bothers you, find an alternative exchange place. But be prepared to answer why. Nothing colder than saying goodbye to your kids from different seats. Hugs are sooo much better with a seat between you. \n\nLearn to co-parent. Even if it's only one day a week. Get over yourselves.", "YTA. \"I don't want to see my fianc\u00e9e's ex for so long\" is what you basically wrote. Maybe you shouldn't have dated a woman who has children. He is part of their lives, and these small moments seem dumb for outsiders, but they are very important to children. He is their dad, for god's sake.", "YTA and incredibly immature. You\u2019ll have to deal with this guy for the next 13 years wether you like it or not. \u201cBarring\u201d him from your home is impractical and silly. Sometimes kids want to show their parent something, sometimes they want a few extra minutes of \u201cgoodbye\u201d time and ultimately the Ex is a human being. So, unless he\u2019s outwardly disrespecting you be a fucking adult and deal with him spending 15 minutes in your house.", "YTA. You have all this righteous anger for what he did to your fianc\u00e9. You are bombastic about how it\u2019s your house and what he doesn\u2019t do. You keep dwelling on all his negative attributes and how it affects you and why you don\u2019t like it. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, the kids like it. The kids want to be inclusive of their father in their lives. The kids want him there. \n\nHere\u2019s what you aren\u2019t getting, their father sees them so little that they want to grab onto every moment they can have with him. They want to squeeze out as much time as they can. They are making up reasons to keep him there longer because they get so precious little time with him. They idolize him. \n\nI get it. He\u2019s no prize to idolize in your fianc\u00e9 and your mind but to him, right now at this age he is Superman. Every attempt you make to steal those extra moments makes you the bad guy. \n\nI am going to tell you a quick story. My dad was amazing. I hit the parent lottery with him. He wasn\u2019t an amazing husband to my mom and when they got divorced, it could have been ugly but nope, my grandma invited him and my stepmother to holiday dinners, my dad would show up to help my mom fix something that broke, they created a family where I felt safe and loved by everyone. \n\nI literally had a whole village. I know my dad wasn\u2019t perfect but he was to me and that\u2019s how these kids see their dad and you pounding on your chest about \u201cMy House and My Foyer\u201d makes you look like the asshole comparing male appendages. \n\nNext time he comes over ask him if he wants to put the kids to bed. Be gracious. That\u2019s the gift I got from my mom. She could have been an ass to my dad once they were divorced but she was gracious. \n\nI got to have the best version of parents and stepparents because people chose to put me ahead of their ego and that\u2019s what you are living off now, ego. \n\nBe gracious.

I am engaged and getting married in a couple of months. I have known the kids and dated my fianc\u00e9 since our 5 year old was 1. Over two years ago the kids moved in with me and live with me and my fiancee full time. their dad only sees them about once every month. The kids go to school in our boundary school, and my fianc\u00e9e has primary placement. Between me and my fiancee we have taken on all of the responsibilities to raising our kids and their dad contributes nothing. \n\nTheir dad has an open invitation to come pickup the kids every Sunday. However, we hardly hear from him and he does not see them as often as we would like.\n\nThe part where I am wondering if AITA: on the days he wants to see the kids, he comes to pick them up. Every time, he knocks on our front door, and then comes inside even though the kids are fully ready to go shoes on and everything. He usually spends 5-10 minutes talking in the foyer and then they go on their way. When he returns with the kids, it is essentially the same thing, except he stands in the foyer and gives a long drawn out, emotional goodbye. He doesn\u2019t try to move things along and it\u2019s awkward to me that I have to be the one to encourage the kids to \u201csay goodbye\u201d and move on with our day and allow him to leave. Occasionally the kids want to bring him upstairs and show them a new toy or something in their bedroom. \n\nI am uncomfortable with this. I don\u2019t like the idea of my fianc\u00e9es ex coming into my house and in personal areas such as our upstairs. I vocalized to my fianc\u00e9e this and she agrees, but she doesn\u2019t want to make things in unnecessarily difficult for the kids so has taken no action on it. I understand. But\u2026\n\nThe other day, after he dropped of the kids, after another long drawn out goodbye, I told the kids to head upstairs and get their pajamas on. I walked outside with their dad and suggested that instead of him coming inside every time that he say all of his goodbyes from the car.

The only person I do this to is my mum, and it\u2019s because she gave me a key and told me to. I wouldn\u2019t just walk into someone\u2019s home otherwise\u2026\nAs for taking 15 mins, it sucks but it\u2019s for the kids", "NTA - it\u2019s your house you get to determine who goes into it as well. Everybody commenting \u201cthe kids live there they get input too\u201d are correct but missing the fact that also applies to YOU. Everybody in a household has the right to be comfortable in their home and have a say who is allowed in. It sounds like you\u2019ve been open-minded and tolerant and that this guy is not picking up on boundaries. Also I find it gross how much everybody is making excuses for the deadbeat dad. He wouldn\u2019t need to linger in the foyer to feel close to them if he actually spent time with them\u2026", "My ex and I literally had as explosive a marital breakdown as possible when our sons were 7 and 8. Unfortunately our sons witnessed this. I moved on to a new relationship and eventually married him. One of my sons hated him for a long long time. Part of what made their relationship better over time is that my ex and I made the decision every day to love our children more than we hated what happened to our marriage. This meant always putting them first - in everything we said and did.  He came in to pick up or drop off the kids because it\u2019s their home and they want to show him things like the new dog, toys, drum set, etc.  We talked while watching them play hockey because it\u2019s important for them. I cleaned out his place for my kids when he passed away because my kids were not emotionally prepared to do it. The point of this is that the kids come first and by doing that, if you are lucky, when they are older they will call you or come to you to talk when they have an issue like my sons do equally with me and their stepdad because they respect and love you from seeing your generosity to them and their father over their life. The opposite can be true. It is why their grown friends still turn up here instead of going to their own families when they have turmoil.", "YTA Here's the thing. We all understand how you feel and dad is being a bit of a jerk. But it's reasonable for the kids to want to show their dad their stuff in their special space. And given that he doesn't always show up, it probably makes more sense for you guys to be hanging out at home versus some other place.\n\nBecause that would be the other option- suggesting to your fianc\u00e9 that you do pick ups and drop offs at a park or a library or a fast food place. Basically someplace that isn't your home and the transition would be smoother.", "Stepmom here. Allowing the kids to bring their parent into their home and show off/share their personal spaces with them is really important for them to feel their world is whole and not separate. It\u2019s important for their emotional well-being. I know it\u2019s hard and often really uncomfortable to be a stepparent. To be a really good one is 100x harder. You clearly love those kids like your own. Being uncomfortable so they can be comfortable is worth it, I promise. NAH", "I knew YTA as soon as you said \"our 5 year old\". No. HER 5 year old. Those aren't your children. You aren't their dad. They have a dad. Let him be a dad.\n\nEdit to add: it also seems like you're super insecure over the fact she has children with another man. You're more concerned that there's an ex in the house.", "You describe him standing in the foyer of your home for five minutes at pickup. And this shows your step children that you are prepared to be civil to their dad when he picks them up.  It's an important message to give. If he is upsetting the kids when he drops them off then it may be worth a chat about about how he says goodbye. But YTA if you can't tolerate him for a few minutes when there is no reason from what you describe to be difficult with him. He is the father of two children you love. Being pleasant with their father will mean a lot to those kids.", "YTA, as a kid living with my mum and step dad I never understood why they couldn\u2019t put aside differences to let me show my dad my room and exciting new things as a child which was really upsetting for me then and now. If he isn\u2019t snooping there shouldn\u2019t be any reason he can\u2019t walk them in or occasionally be shown something they\u2019re excited about. The kids will thank you for putting aside differences in the future", "jfc he's not a hired help in the 1880's, and even hired help would be allowed indoors. He's the parent. He should be interested in you and who you are and your place with the kids. You cna't spare 5-10 minutes for him? YTA", "YTA. They're his kids, and if they want him in their home, they're totally entitled to have him there. If you don't like it, you're not ready to marry a woman who has children with a father who is involved in their lives.", "YTA. Not because of him though. Because of the kids. My ex husband and I have been divorced for 10yrs. I've been with my current husband that whole time. My children with my ex are 15 and 13 and he has been in every single home I have had. As has his wife, who he has been with for the same as I've been with my husband. I don't often go into their house, but I have in the past.", "I would not be ok with him knocking and letting himself in the door but the rest makes YTA", "Reddit is a wild place. crazy sometimes", "Yes. When it\u2019s just me, he\u2019s out very quick", "How tf is he wrong for not just wanting someone to walk in his house. If the kids had friends they would have to get permission to walk in also.", "He\u2019s not their \u201cdaddy\u201d though. He\u2019s their biological father, sure, but it takes more than seeing your kids maybe once a month to be a daddy.", "Holy jump to conclusions batman", "Love this. I wish I could have explained it the way you do. You captured it spot on", "If the kids want to show him something, that's one thing. But holy shit how entitled do you need to be to, yes first knock, but then just open the door and walk in as if you own the place.\n\nThat's ridiculous, and it's even more ridiculous that people are giving him a pass for this and trying to make it sound like OPs getting into a pissing contest with him.", "No, he may be their father, but he does not have the right to be in his ex wife's house when she has a husband!", "This kind of sounds like OP is possessive over the kids and now that the dad is coming in and the kids want to talk and show him around, OP could feel threatened because with the dad around there\u2019s no chance of OP becoming their \u201cdad\u201d just based off of how he says \u201cour 5 year old\u201d and so forth. Could be wrong and this could literally just be a \u201cyour weird for wanting to be in my house so stay out of my house\u201d my mom was the same way with my dad and I always thought it was weird as to why he couldn\u2019t come in", "Yeah, I definitely understand the impulse but let the kids have him in their rooms.", "Bruh literally had all day to talk to them. He is extremely awkward doing this and OP is NTA for wanting a boundary.", "You must have missed the part where he's absent 90% of his custody days, is not on good terms with their mother, and only does this \"show\" when she's around?", "I am so appreciative of this post. Thank you. Aside from living with your parents, our story is exactly the same and that is my thought process on everything. I wish I could have gotten it out like this in my original post. I was laughing about the comment with the bugs and the weather! I can\u2019t stand when he\u2019s holding our screen door open letting all the bugs in and letting the dog get out. \n\nYou\u2019re right. It is a drama production, only put on infront of my fianc\u00e9e. It gets the kids upset, unnecessarily and that\u2019s what makes me mad. Him coming in the house wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he would actually say good bye and encourage the kids/teach the kids that it\u2019s \u201cok\u201d and dad will be back.", "You\u2019re the AH for this comment. MY kids call me dad, and you don\u2019t get to suggest that I am anything other. Some how providing stability, help with homework, teaching them how to catch a baseball, a roof over someone\u2019s head, home cooked meals and love and care every single day while the real DAD is not there doesn\u2019t earn someone that title. \n\nThe expectations people like you have of step parents is just astounding. Like I\u2019m supposed to have no thought or feelings on any subject and that I should solely operate \u201cfor the kids\u201d. I wish people like you held \u201creal\u201d dads to the same standard. How about they start by showing up every week..\n\nI\u2019m not preventing their bio dad from being their dad. He is. He has an open opportunity to see them every single week! He usually takes about 1/4 of them. And that\u2019s being generous. Heck, he could even have more time if he would ask for it. Sometimes we go months without hearing from him. Thanks for your input. I am their Dad whether you like it or not", "You missed the part where they don't coparent , he is a deadbeat, who abandoned mum on awful terms? It's a show", "I appreciate your perspective. Thank you for sharing. I agree and I think your right about putting differences aside", "I had stepparents like this, I do not miss them\n\nThe older I got, I saw how it was no more than a peeing contest over territory \n\nThere are other men in the world, ones who even have dated your wife, drop it", "Please stay strong! Don't make a scene but you are not grasping at straws here you are reasonable", ">If the guy wanted to be there for his kids, he would see them at least for all his scheduled times. \n\nWe don't know *why* he doesn't see them as often as he's allowed to. Maybe he's a lazy deadbeat who doesn't care, and just uses his kids once per month to... linger in OP's foyer for 15 minutes. Not quite the criminal mastermind you seem to think he is.\n\nOr maybe it's the only Sunday a month he can get off work, or borrow a car, or any other possible reason why he's not able to freely come and go as he pleases. Not everyone has the necessary resources for that.", "We don't know the reason why he doesn't see them more often. There might be a legit reason, but we don't know the father's side.", "Knocking and coming straight into your home is a huge issue.  I'm sure other relatives knock and wait for you to answer the door", ">We are uncomfortable with this. If he wants more time with the kids, he can have it! He doesn\u2019t need to send that time in my foyer, and I shouldn\u2019t be looked at as they guy that has to kick their dad out.\n\nThis part actually makes your issue seem more reasonable to me than your post does. I read that as you not wanting him to come in at all, but didn't offer him an alternative - as in, \"Hey, just pick them up earlier or bring them in later if you want to, just don't keep hanging around our home so we're the bad guys that have to kick daddy out.\"\n\nDoes he ever give a reason why he doesn't come visit the kids more often?", "It is weird. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to insert himself into your home. He should feel a bit uncomfortable there, but he apparently, doesn\u2019t", "OP, I think you need to add this to your original post. Side note- Have you tried having your fianc\u00e9e pick the kids up from the ex\u2019s place instead? Or just locking your front door so this guy has to knock instead of walking right into your house? I think you\u2019re NTA, but you definitely need to be careful not to give the ex any ammunition to turn you into the bad guy to the kids. Your wife needs to be the one handling this. Is there any reason you have to be in the area when the kids get dropped off?", "He's not a vampire. He's a father, who was invited by his kids. Did you not see that episode of Buffy? Doesn't have to be the homeowner to make the invite", "Kids can come in and bring their toys outside.  Why not give a bag for them to travel with some toys in there?  No reason dad should ever have to come in.\n\nI'd be irked too but actually I'm telling OP to trust his gut here.  If it seems fishy and it's not hurting the kids, he should stand his ground.  There are too many alternatives to solve this.  If there weren't somehow, I'd say you should let this guy have his time.  And I am.  But it doesn't have to be under you roof.  You don't have to sacrifice your comfort for ANYONE, not even your wife's kids.  And then even, if you were being petty, you still wouldn't be wrong.  Maybe an AH but not wrong.\n\nSo I have no judgement.  NAH or ESH.  Take your pick.  Might've changed with more information.\n\nAsking someone to be a mature adult isn't hard.  If it hurts the kids that he's not let in, that sucks.  But the dad has had plenty of opportunities to be better and he hasn't improved.", "That's just passing the duty to the kids to police bio dad. Bio dad needs to drop the kids off and not mope around", "0 minutes.", "I really meant that because this guy has the opportunity to pick his kids up EVERY week and yet only does so every month.  Again if there were more information my assessment might change.  How far does this guy live away and what kind of life is he living?  Does he have the funds to visit any more often?\n\nIf 'positive' answers to both of those questions, then that changes the situation for me too.\n\nBut this guy standing in opie's house having an extended goodbye doesn't make sense without more.  He misses his kids so damn much and yet doesn't see them so damn much.  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I don't know whether OP not feeling comfortable or safe in his own house is worth compromising for this guy (or the kids).  Their dad is hurting them all by himself, not OP.  OPs about himself as well and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nEDIT: some are saying, it's the kids house too.  Actually they live there yes.  But the ones making the decisions are OP and mom.  Mom is uncomfortable with the situation as well but doesn't want to hurt the kids relationship.  Again, i say, dad is doing a great job all on his own.  Two uncomfortable people should work to make another comfortable?  When this guy can't even come to pick his kids up 1 out of 4-5 weeks...? It's a big 'Hhmm' from me when he tries to come in.  It seems to me that it's an opportunity for OP to BE the asshole for the right reasons (not making fiance look like the 'bitch ex, mother of my kids') to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Thoughts?\n\nFull disclosure, I have an absent father who denied me until is was 18 and was raised by a single mom (only child tho) so I might have different assumptions about fathers for sure."]}
