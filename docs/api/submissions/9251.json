I am engaged and getting married in a couple of months. I have known the kids and dated my fianc\u00e9 since our 5 year old was 1. Over two years ago the kids moved in with me and live with me and my fiancee full time. their dad only sees them about once every month. The kids go to school in our boundary school, and my fianc\u00e9e has primary placement. Between me and my fiancee we have taken on all of the responsibilities to raising our kids and their dad contributes nothing. \n\nTheir dad has an open invitation to come pickup the kids every Sunday. However, we hardly hear from him and he does not see them as often as we would like.\n\nThe part where I am wondering if AITA: on the days he wants to see the kids, he comes to pick them up. Every time, he knocks on our front door, and then comes inside even though the kids are fully ready to go shoes on and everything. He usually spends 5-10 minutes talking in the foyer and then they go on their way. When he returns with the kids, it is essentially the same thing, except he stands in the foyer and gives a long drawn out, emotional goodbye. He doesn\u2019t try to move things along and it\u2019s awkward to me that I have to be the one to encourage the kids to \u201csay goodbye\u201d and move on with our day and allow him to leave. Occasionally the kids want to bring him upstairs and show them a new toy or something in their bedroom. \n\nI am uncomfortable with this. I don\u2019t like the idea of my fianc\u00e9es ex coming into my house and in personal areas such as our upstairs. I vocalized to my fianc\u00e9e this and she agrees, but she doesn\u2019t want to make things in unnecessarily difficult for the kids so has taken no action on it. I understand. But\u2026\n\nThe other day, after he dropped of the kids, after another long drawn out goodbye, I told the kids to head upstairs and get their pajamas on. I walked outside with their dad and suggested that instead of him coming inside every time that he say all of his goodbyes from the car. I said this with good intentions and implying that he deserves a good, and private goodbye with his kids without me or my fianc\u00e9 lingering around. I suggested once he is done with his good bye, the kids can walk up to the steps and wave when they get inside. To me this makes things easier on everyone and I don\u2019t have to have my personal boundaries violated. \n\nHis only response was that he doesn\u2019t get to see them much and that he didn\u2019t realize it was a problem bringing them up to the door. (Reminder he has the opportunity to see them every week but he never does).

I unfortunately have this happen way too much to friends and family where the non custodial parent has committed assault or displayed violent/verbal abuse  behavior as soon as they enter a home with and without any prior history. Typically for child services they do note as safety tip and/or for your comfort level to meet children outside and you personally bring them inside.\n\nHowever, this is a conversation your wife needs to have with the kids father. And loop in a lawyer and getting an amendment to the order if there is an issue.", "NTA for how you feel, at all. \n\nI'm approaching this as someone who co-parents with an ex and their new wife. We have a designated spot that is not anyone's home but a public place, where we meet for exchanges. I think that's pretty common? \n\nNow, sometimes, the new wife will come to pick up my child from my house. I don't have a problem with this as it is easier on the kid (doing battle only once with car seat, not having to haul things from one car to another, getting more time actually with me rather than in the car with me driving, and so on). But the new wife is not allowed in my house, just as I would not expect to go into their home if the situation was reversed. We say our hellos and goodbyes at the front door. We might chat for a few minutes. If my kid wants to show something like a toy or a drawing to their step-mother, they just bring it to the door. \n\nAnd the thing is, the adults involved in the situation understand this and we work together to get over any awkward bumps that might arise. It's weird that the biodad does not seem to get that in your case. But you're not an asshole, or doing a disservice to your future step kids by setting a boundary that you aren't comfortable with him being in your home. I don't think you even said that, you just aren't comfortable with him lingering a long time. \n\nI also know it can be hard to say goodbye, and that sometimes it can take awhile. But I think you're being very reasonable with what you're saying, and you shouldn't have to make all the compromises and adjustments.", "NTA. I think this is a performance on his part. You should put the kids first but you don't have to let this person in your house on the off chance it might be better for them this way. No way to him going upstairs. I'm thinking of my parents when I say that and it grosses me out to even think of letting my dad into my mom's house.", "INFO: Does he actually \\*do\\* anything other than take longer than you would like to say goodbye, go see something that his kids have invited him to see, breathe and exist? Unless there is something else going on, I don't see why the whole 'he steps inside our house' is such an issue. \n\nAnd you just spent two paragraphs explaining that you don't even want the man's presence in your house so don't rework it now to make it seem like you are being concerned for HIM and his goodbyes. \n\nAnd this is the kids' home, too, right? Barring their father being abusive, nasty, a thief, etc., why shouldn't they be able to show them a favorite toy, etc.\n\nThe 5-10 minutes each time doesn't seem like a hill to die on to me. Barring additional information, I'm going with YTA.", "NTA", "NTA. He has no right to be on your property seeing your kids. He wants to have his below bare minimum contact with the children he donated DNA to AND encroach upon his ex and your personal space. No. Keep him on the sidewalk. Keep boundaries in tact.", "At the kids ages - YTA. \n\nYou seem to be more concerned about him being \"fianc\u00e9e's EX\" than being their daddy. \n\nMaybe it's time to start thinking about what's best for those kids, and less about how having her ex around makes you uncomfortable. He's not being inappropriate, you're just uncomfortable with the evidence that she has a past.", "NTA. When I was a kid, I\u2019d have HATED what he does.  An adult being upset about saying good bye is awful for kids.  It sounds like he is putting on a show for you and your fianc\u00e9e. The kids are going to see through this soon.  It may not be a good idea for you to be the one YO put a stop to it, but I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to.  He sounds like a\u2026challenge.", "I can\u2019t get onboard with thinking you\u2019re the AH because you don\u2019t want to entertain your fianc\u00e9s ex putting on his part time dad performance. \n\nJust because he doesn\u2019t utilize the time with his kids isn\u2019t your problem - the only caveat is that if the kids do want to show him something on their rooms you should acquiesce because their lives will be better if they feel the grownups get along. \n\nBut dude doesn\u2019t need to post up in your house otherwise.", "YTA. He belongs to those kids. Think of him like a pet that is allowed limited access to the house. Let him in. He can see their rooms, he can talk to them, but then he goes back outside. \n\nThe kids want him there. They love him. He\u2019s not going to poop in the floor so let him be there for a little while. \n\nIf it went in for hours and disrupted your life, I\u2019d understand. He doesn\u2019t sound like the best father. Your concern is noted. Even so, he\u2019s their\u2019s. Accept it.", "NTA even with the kids bringing him to their rooms he should be considerate of you guys and tell them to bring whatever they want to show to him. And fifteen minutes is actually a long time to be saying goodbye and it sounds like he\u2019s just trying to be a busy body by insisting on coming inside. My ex-husband did this and literally put his feet up on my table. I never once set foot in his place uninvited, it\u2019s not hard to respect people\u2019s privacy, doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s the dad, doesn\u2019t mean he gets an open door, it\u2019s not his home.", "YTA. I understand why you don\u2019t love having him come upstairs, but his kids want him to see their rooms. That can be a big deal to kids. Isn\u2019t what makes them feel good and connected to their father (who is definitely an AH for not seeing them more) more important than your vague feeling of unease?   \n\n\nOf course, if he\u2019s snooped or done something else upstairs that gives you specific reason to distrust him, that\u2019s a different situation.", "NTA\n\nHe has zero business coming to your house, especially going upstairs. You have every right to this boundary. He can say his goodbyes from his car.\n\nETA: OP, you're getting REALLY weird responses,  there have been similar posts here before, and they would've all faired you not T A. You could try the stepparenting sub on here, you'd get more sound advice to what you can actually do to stop this.", "YTA. \n\nTry thinking of him as the kids' father and not your SO's ex. Walking kids to the door is normal.  Kids showing dad their room is normal.  Don't make it more than it is.  \n\nWhen the adults get along,  kids feel safe. Gift that to your stepkids.", "You are a mid level AH.  It\u2019s 10 minutes on the pick up.  I\u2019m a child of divorce that was bitter.  It would have changed a lot for me to see my parents talking about the weather for 10 minutes. The goodbye thing is weird I get. But another 10 minutes isn\u2019t going to kill you.  If you don\u2019t want him going upstairs, that\u2019s understandable.  But he isn\u2019t hurting anyone by lingering inside. It\u2019s just an annoying inconvenience for you.  But it\u2019s important for the kids \n\nFather might be a bigger one for not seeing the kids every chance he gets. But you seem to be the bigger person. So just suck up 20 minutes for the kids", "NTA. He really doesn't need to come inside. I would probably keep the door locked when he is coming, he can say good bye on the porch or in the car as you said. Yes, that means he will need to knock for you to let the kids in, but if he can't abide by a polite request you don't have much other choice.", "I kind of get the discomfort with having him upstairs  in the private areas of your home. I think you\u2019d be NTA to set that boundary. Have the kids bring the toy downstairs if they want to show it off. He may be their father, but it\u2019s your home. \n\nAs for the foyer, I feel you\u2019re kind of out of line there. It\u2019s a foyer. It\u2019s as close to being outside the house as you can get. Other commenters have pointed out, if you can keep this civil it will be best for the kids. So tune him out, walk away if you have to, while they say their goodbyes. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA\n\nYou are jealous. And it shouldn't be a problem that he's just chatting them up before he leaves. Your fiancee didn't want to stop him because it makes things easier but you do realize the kids will notice the change and as they get older, they will realize YOU are the one with an issue with their dad. He's literally doing nothing but talking to his kids, not even his ex. This is gross.", "NTA. You\u2019re setting a boundary OP. There\u2019s nothing wrong with setting healthy boundaries. Consider going to the library for books that will help you to explain to the children, too.", "NTA\n\nThe dad has plenty of opportunity to see his kids but chooses to not see them as frequently as he pretends to want.\n\nHe does not have to step into the house to say goodbye.  The porch is fine.  \n\nI take it he has a house himself.  Would he be happy if the OP came in and spent time in his lounge and making out he wasn't too keen on leaving.  And the kids could say that dad has a new picture/toy in the house and want to show the OP if he picked up the kids and he may not want the OP to just come through his house.\n\nThe issue doesn't seem to be so much about about bringing them to the door. It's the coming in and hanging around inside the OP's house.  He can spend two hours saying goodbye to the kids in the car if he wants to.  He could even do that on the street.  But he's actually coming inside the house where he actually has no right at all.  Same applies to the OP's wife if she was dropping their kids off to him.  She doesn't have a right to walk into his house and stay there.", "Even if he had the kids 50/50 and was a present parent there is no reason for him to come into the home if you and your fianc\u00e9 aren't ok with it. I think this needs to be a conversation she has with him and the kids. \n\nIf they want to show him something they can bring it down/outside. They're fairly young so it's time to set this precedent. \n\nIt's perfectly fine setting a boundary in your home.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nAfter a divorce, exes of whatever gender should not be trying to push their way back in. And OP's house is his castle. If he doesn't want the ex inside, that's it. The ex can make his long-drawn-out farewells outside.\n\nAnd why is he hanging around OP's house JUST AFTER having seen the kids that day? This is some sort of stunt to weasel his way into a marriage that he resents, and I doubt his ex-wife wants anything to do with him, either.\n\nAnd she should stop hiding behind the furniture and join her voice to her husband's.\n\nThis intrusive behavior of an ex, when it isn't banned by BOTH parents, is often the reason why second marriages fail. The ex may not be trying to sabotage this family that leaves him out, but he may do considerable damage even so.", "Nta. Your request is perfectly reasonable.", "Nta. If it continues, keep the door locked. Let the kids knock on the door to be let in. You can stop him coming in.", "No matter what the issue is.  If there are kids involved that are not yours, \n\npeople will make you the asshole.  There is no winning.\n\nNta\n\nBut you will never win.", "YTA.  Bio dad may suck, but the kids seem to enjoy every moment they get with him and are excited to show off their rooms/home/toys to him.  If you can't suck up an extra 10-20 minutes with this guy every 2 weeks for the sake of the kids, who by your own admission has done nothing worse than lingering awkwardly, then you are not ready to be a successful co-parent.  It's not about what makes you or their mom or their dad comfortable, it's about what is best for those two little kiddos.", "NTA, your house.", "I was thinking nta until I read OP's responses to the comments.  If you really can't stand him in your house, take the kids and meet him somewhere halfway between your residences. I traded my daughter to my ex at the bookstore for years. It was kind of expensive buying her a book every time he didn't show, but he behaved a lot better in public. Maybe you'd feel better in public, too.\n\nYou could also leave the ex relationship to your fianc\u00e9e.", "YTA and sound pretty dang insecure. What he's doing doesn't sound unreasonable and is more comfortable for the kids than having to stand outside or sit in a car to say goodbye. You say it doesn't happen often? Then don't get your panties in a bunch. Have your wife stand there. Or let your kids stand there with their dad and you be in the next room.", "YTA. You are acting from a place of jealousy and insecurity. Even if you are a great step-dad, this is the kids bio-dad: he will always be on a pedestal in their eyes (until they are older and figure out all the adult's flaws for themselves). Kids are very perceptive, even if they don't understand all the details, and they *will* pick up on how you treat their dad. This will both be a mark against you and a source of distress for them. It is better for the kids that their parental figures are stable and get along. You sound a lot like a dog pissing on the corner to mark his territory. Be the better person and be gracious.", "ESH. Yes, it\u2019s your house but those are his kids and you invited your fianc\u00e9 and her children there. As such, it\u2019s also their house too. I bet those kids would want their dad to come in but because they are young, you aren\u2019t considering their feelings. If you can\u2019t deal with him being in your life, don\u2019t marry the kids mother.", "YTA \n\nThey are small children. He is their father. It's a few minutes. It's their home, too.\n\nPS. The children can, and do, love both of you.", "ESH - if it means that much to you, go wait outside with the kids a minute before he arrives and then you go pick them up from outside.", "YTA and super defensive on your comments did you want perspective or a pat on the back? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re being legit but even you said it\u2019s once a month and not as often as you\u2019d like but can\u2019t even extend basic curtesy when he does show up so why do you think he\u2019d ever try to come more. Just be the bigger person for the kids", "Neither of you are the AH. Regardless if you want to or not, you\u2019re now coparenting. Ask him to wait to be invited in, instead of just walking in. Build a relationship with him. I\u2019m not saying be his friend but you\u2019ll be able to come to understandings a lot easier in the future if there is a coparenting relationship.", "NTA there is no reason for him to enter your house, and you told him so in a very polite and respectful way.  He isn't being an ass with entering the house since he isn't pushing himself in...he is an ass for not seeing his kids very often.", "YTA. You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing, whether you like it or not he\u2019s their father.", "ESH kids who grow up with happier co-parenting relationships will be happier kids. Just leave the area so you don't deal with it.  We're talking 5-10 minutes on the rare Sunday he comes. 20 maybe Max once a month?  Even every Sunday isn't that much for their father.", "NTA. You have a right to express/enforce your boundaries and this is not an abnormal request.", "Nta.  Just establish a clear boundary.  You're being kinda wishy washy with it.", "YTA - Build bridges; don\u2019t knock them down.", "Ehhh   I have sympathy here, my coparent is a lingerer, he stays too long, invites himself into my house and makes himself at home despite numerous conversations.\n\nThis just sounds normal to me, he in the entry way is that really a hill to die on?", "YTA.", "YTA. Let the man say goodbye to his kids. If it bothers you, don't stand around watching it.", "NTA \n\nIgnore the he's the dad he can do anything he wants bs. I went through this myself and it is insulting, disrespectful and rude. \n\nAlso, If being the dad matters, he would be taking care of and seeing his kids the way he should be.", "YTA. Stop being an asshole. Get ahold of your jealousy and insecurities. There\u2019s no reason for it.", "NAH \n\nI think it's a reasonable request. I also don't think he is purposefully being malicious, unless from now on he continues to violate your request", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries about your home, and I don\u2019t think his response was meant to invoke any guilt.\n\nEDIT: While I still think it\u2019s ok if you can\u2019t handle having him inside your home at all, I do agree with the commenters saying it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal for him to linger around the entrance. Unless he\u2019s saying things like \u201cMOM doesn\u2019t let me see you more\u201d, he\u2019s not exactly doing anything malicious.", "ESH\n\nHe should spend more time with the kids, but you could have handled this better.\n\nFirst, you need to remember that you might think of it as your house, but it is also the kids' home. \n\nWhen the ex comes to pick up the kids, a bit of small talk is pretty much expected - the weather, the plans for the day, things the kids might need while they're gone, how the local team did in last night's game, etc. Some of this will be an exchange of information while some will just be an attempt to be polite. \n\nWhen he brings the kids home, bringing them up to the door is just being protective of them. If the kids want to show him something, they can bring it downstairs in most cases and ask permission to bring him upstairs if it is something they can't bring downstairs (ex.: a new bed). If he lingers a bit too long, just tell him you've got to get the kids to bed, get back to something simmering on the stove, or some similar excuse. He'll get the message after a few such excuses.", "YTA but softly. Firstly, to give credit where credit is due, you have done a wonderful job raising these children and it's clear that they come from a loving home.\n\nI absolutely understand that your home is your safe space and you are entitled to feel positive in your own home. That being said, this is also the kids' home too, and they are too young to understand most things which you understand. They are excited to see their part time parent and want to maximise the time with him.\nThe kids are the priority in this situation, and they need to see situations whereby all parental figures involved interact positively and co-parent together. They need to see that it is healthy for people to divorce/split but remain on civilised terms. The kids need to feel secure in knowing that they won't end up in a situation where the adults may argue.", "YTA \n\nYou give steps a bad name. Believe me, those of us that have had the bad ones because of attitudes towards our other parent...we don't forget it. Your fight, anger,  disgust, frustration, or whatever emotion you feel about the ex or the other is yours. It's not the kids issue, don't make it one. And at their age, they'll soon sense and figure out your emotions and start questioning it. \n\nIf it really bothers you, find an alternative exchange place. But be prepared to answer why. Nothing colder than saying goodbye to your kids from different seats. Hugs are sooo much better with a seat between you. \n\nLearn to co-parent. Even if it's only one day a week. Get over yourselves.", "YTA. \"I don't want to see my fianc\u00e9e's ex for so long\" is what you basically wrote. Maybe you shouldn't have dated a woman who has children. He is part of their lives, and these small moments seem dumb for outsiders, but they are very important to children. He is their dad, for god's sake.", "YTA and incredibly immature. You\u2019ll have to deal with this guy for the next 13 years wether you like it or not. \u201cBarring\u201d him from your home is impractical and silly. Sometimes kids want to show their parent something, sometimes they want a few extra minutes of \u201cgoodbye\u201d time and ultimately the Ex is a human being. So, unless he\u2019s outwardly disrespecting you be a fucking adult and deal with him spending 15 minutes in your house.", "YTA. You have all this righteous anger for what he did to your fianc\u00e9. You are bombastic about how it\u2019s your house and what he doesn\u2019t do. You keep dwelling on all his negative attributes and how it affects you and why you don\u2019t like it. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, the kids like it. The kids want to be inclusive of their father in their lives. The kids want him there. \n\nHere\u2019s what you aren\u2019t getting, their father sees them so little that they want to grab onto every moment they can have with him. They want to squeeze out as much time as they can. They are making up reasons to keep him there longer because they get so precious little time with him. They idolize him. \n\nI get it. He\u2019s no prize to idolize in your fianc\u00e9 and your mind but to him, right now at this age he is Superman. Every attempt you make to steal those extra moments makes you the bad guy. \n\nI am going to tell you a quick story. My dad was amazing. I hit the parent lottery with him. He wasn\u2019t an amazing husband to my mom and when they got divorced, it could have been ugly but nope, my grandma invited him and my stepmother to holiday dinners, my dad would show up to help my mom fix something that broke, they created a family where I felt safe and loved by everyone. \n\nI literally had a whole village. I know my dad wasn\u2019t perfect but he was to me and that\u2019s how these kids see their dad and you pounding on your chest about \u201cMy House and My Foyer\u201d makes you look like the asshole comparing male appendages. \n\nNext time he comes over ask him if he wants to put the kids to bed. Be gracious. That\u2019s the gift I got from my mom. She could have been an ass to my dad once they were divorced but she was gracious. \n\nI got to have the best version of parents and stepparents because people chose to put me ahead of their ego and that\u2019s what you are living off now, ego. \n\nBe gracious.

I am engaged and getting married in a couple of months. I have known the kids and dated my fianc\u00e9 since our 5 year old was 1. Over two years ago the kids moved in with me and live with me and my fiancee full time. their dad only sees them about once every month. The kids go to school in our boundary school, and my fianc\u00e9e has primary placement. Between me and my fiancee we have taken on all of the responsibilities to raising our kids and their dad contributes nothing. \n\nTheir dad has an open invitation to come pickup the kids every Sunday. However, we hardly hear from him and he does not see them as often as we would like.\n\nThe part where I am wondering if AITA: on the days he wants to see the kids, he comes to pick them up. Every time, he knocks on our front door, and then comes inside even though the kids are fully ready to go shoes on and everything. He usually spends 5-10 minutes talking in the foyer and then they go on their way. When he returns with the kids, it is essentially the same thing, except he stands in the foyer and gives a long drawn out, emotional goodbye. He doesn\u2019t try to move things along and it\u2019s awkward to me that I have to be the one to encourage the kids to \u201csay goodbye\u201d and move on with our day and allow him to leave. Occasionally the kids want to bring him upstairs and show them a new toy or something in their bedroom. \n\nI am uncomfortable with this. I don\u2019t like the idea of my fianc\u00e9es ex coming into my house and in personal areas such as our upstairs. I vocalized to my fianc\u00e9e this and she agrees, but she doesn\u2019t want to make things in unnecessarily difficult for the kids so has taken no action on it. I understand. But\u2026\n\nThe other day, after he dropped of the kids, after another long drawn out goodbye, I told the kids to head upstairs and get their pajamas on. I walked outside with their dad and suggested that instead of him coming inside every time that he say all of his goodbyes from the car.

This guy gets them once a month. Of course the goodbye is going to be emotional and drawn out. If you are going to prioritize your comfort over your kids (since you keep saying they're yours) than prepare for plenty of resentment and disrespect from them. They'll dish back what you serve.", "No, it\u2019s the kids.  They\u2019re the most important \n\nAlso if he knows it bugs you he\u2019s likely to continue .  Calm , cool and collected.  High road always.  The kids will remember that you were always there in the wings waiting for them. They can\u2019t see it now but they will", "Dude you are missing the point entirely and honestly I think you're being willfully ignorant. You know it, we know it. You're fooling nobody.", "Kids or not that is YOUR house key word being YOURS", "You seem to be an amazing step dad and are doing a great job. I think your boys appreciate having their dad around when he chooses to be..I don't see any harm in having him around for the goodbyes and hellos. Your kids will realise any hostility you show the dad and they should not grow up wondering what is wrong . I suggest let things be if they don't hurt. The boys deserve the best and the most they can get out of both their dads", "NTA!! Even if he was amazing, you have every right to tell anyone to not come in your house. His response is very telling by the way. Any normal person would respect what you said about your home, even if they think you're an AH. He just argued with you about why you're wrong. Wonder why she's not with him anymore?", "nta this a power move and he\u2019s using the kids to do it. If it was really about the children, he would move heaven and earth to see them on his(their coustody) time.", "NTA, its your house your rules, also dont let him just walk inside when nobody lets him in thats weird.", "YTA. \n\nMy husband and his ex wife don\u2019t like each other. At all. But we talk every time we exchange the kids. We\u2019ve been in her house a lot and she\u2019s been in our house a lot. It doesn\u2019t matter what petty little thing she\u2019s done the week before, we\u2019ll still stop and conversate about the kids. Because they are the important people in this scenario. I get it. You spend the majority of the time with them and you\u2019ve got that feeling that you\u2019re more their father than the other guy is. The problem is\u2026 those kids don\u2019t see it that way. HE is their dad. So to all of a sudden not allow him in the house? Bad call. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s just doing it to try to show you up. Grit your teeth and smile and remember that the kids are watching. They\u2019ll understand one day that he wasn\u2019t the best dad. But until then\u2026 fake it til you make it.", "YTA\n\nThe kids live there too, and him walking them in and showing them affection is a good thing. Especially because they don\u2019t see him much.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to erase him from their space because he makes you uncomfortable. They need to be able to feel he knows them and a big part of that is seeing their lives and showing he cares.\n\nBeing amicable and comfortable with him is what you do for the kids. It\u2019s not a competition, there\u2019s no limit to love and appreciation. You don\u2019t have to always be the one in control and capable etc.\n\nIt sucks he doesn\u2019t see them more often, I can\u2019t comment as some peoples lives are more difficult than I can fathom. I am glad he shows them it\u2019s not them when he can. Imho you should be too if you care about those kids so much (and not just making them yours).", "NTA, if you both don't want him in your house then dont let him in. Start getting the kids ready early so when he drives up you've got them out the door and ready to go. Same as when they get home just greet them at the car and say goodbye there. Sure kids want to share things across parents, but they get rules easily too. \n\nThe best advice I can give you though is to not make a thing out of it where you can. Its in the kids best interest for you all to get along, for the kids to see you all get along. But they can see that just as well from the drive as they can from the house.", "I've read your comments OP and you've mentioned repeatedly that their dad has the option to see them every Sunday but only actually does about once a month and (contributes nothing to them) I assume you mean financially, so where the child support lawsuit?\n\nYou also kept mentioning that you feel like he is putting on a show in YOUR FOYER. If he's stating that he doesn't get to see them much in a performative way then simply state the fact that actually he can see them every Sunday per the agreement but he usually doesn't. \n\nIf he is putting on then baring him from the house will only make it worse and make you the bad guy which... I almost forget Yta. \n\nYour wife has a past. You chose a woman with kids. This is pretty standard and tbh you've got it easy. Many bio dads are alot worse than this dude.", "I think OP would prefer if bio dad would disappear into the night, never to return so he can officially be the one and only for real. Not that it's inherently wrong to wish things had been different but you don't act on it.... They are young. Do what's right for them.", "He\u2019s more of a father to \u201cthe\u201d kids than their bio dad. The bio dad doesn\u2019t have rights to OP\u2019s home just because \u201chis\u201d kids live there. He could get his act together, man up and see the kids at every possible opportunity, but he doesn\u2019t. OP is allowed to have boundaries.", "Look, everyone agrees that their dad should do more for them. He should visit more. And I think it's great you've stepped up. It's great you see them as yours.\n\nBut what is the reason he can't be in the foyer, exactly? I legit don't understand so I honestly ask back to please explain. Your uncomfortable your kid's dad is in your home beacuse he's your wife's ex. Why? He's not hitting on your wife right? Your wife dosen't want him back. Your clearly doing a better job then he did as her partner and coparent. What exactly is the problem in terms of him being an ex of your wife then? You just can't handle the idea your wife had sex with someone before you, or?\n\nLook, this is your kid's dad. And yeah, he's not a great dad. But they are still going to love him at this age. As your kid's dad he is going to be in their life, *and that means your life,* for the next 13 years. You need to start getting used to that idea.\n\nI'm not saying you have to invite him round for every family BBQ or something. But when your kids have events, things like birthday parties in your home, they shouldn't have to worry about how step-daddy is to sensitive and can't handle daddy touching the floors of his home. Likewise, him hanging out for 10 minutes during pick up and drop off less then once a week during which he isn't doing anything inappropriate or insulting anyone etc seems . . . harmless? And you banning that is could be noticeable by the kids and come off as animosity.", "Sure. But it\u2019s not up to him if he\u2019s their father or not. It\u2019s up to 2 people. And two people alone. And they seem to very much love their daddy.", " I would probably keep the door locked when he is coming, he can say good bye on the porch or in the car as you said."]}
