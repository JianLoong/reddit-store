(I\u2019m not gonna reveal what kind for privacy sake.) It\u2019s a small office but we are very busy and I am one of 3 receptionists. The doctor I work is great, this isn\u2019t anything against him. It\u2019s his freaking wife. \n\nI\u2019ve worked at this office for over a year. She calls him all the goddamn time. He leaves his cell phone on during work, as most doctors do. Which wouldn\u2019t be an issue if this woman didn\u2019t call him multiple times a day every day. He leaves his phone in his office. She calls, it rings. If he doesn\u2019t pick up, it\u2019s because he\u2019s with a patient or doing something else important. Usually if he hears his phone ring he will pick up. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem: if he doesn\u2019t pick up, she immediately calls the office phone. \n\nFor info: His kids are grown, they all work, his wife works.\n\nLike I said, it\u2019s a busy office. Along with his overbooked schedule, there are three nurses who also have full schedules. (I know this doesn\u2019t seem like a normal dr. office but I don\u2019t want to reveal what kind it is for privacy). I\u2019m freaking busy as hell at the front desk. None of the receptionists work at the same time so I\u2019m holding down the fort by myself. \n\nSo today: She calls his phone five times and he picks up all five times. This is all before lunch mind you. So she calls once again, but this time he is in surgery. For obvious reasons he can\u2019t pick up. So she calls the office phone. \n\nI already have two people on hold, I\u2019m checking two patients out and rebooking them, and I\u2019m dealing with a new patient. I pick up, not knowing it\u2019s her because we don\u2019t have caller ID, and say \u201cthank you for calling ***** office please hold.\u201d She goes \u201cno it\u2019s me can I speak to my husband?\u201d I say \u201cI\u2019ll tell him you called and he\u2019ll call you back when he\u2019s free.\u201d And I hang up to deal with the three patients. I decided not to tell him she called because he was in surgery and I\u2019m in the middle of a thousand things. \n\nNot five minutes later she calls back, right before I\u2019m about to get to the two patients on hold. I answer, tell her the same thing and she goes \u201cso what you\u2019re just gonna hang up?\u201d I say \u201che\u2019s in surgery I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to be but I\u2019ll put you on hold and go tell him.\u201d So I go let him know he tells me to tell her he will call her back. I tell her he\u2019ll call her back and hang up. \n\nI can\u2019t be playing messenger for her all day. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. My mother says I\u2019m being rude and maybe I am but I don\u2019t have time for this. \n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s a perfectly fine woman, as I\u2019ve never actually met her. \n\nHe\u2019s got a iPhone she it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t text him or wait for him to call her back. I\u2019m just so freaking fed up. I can\u2019t keep bugging my boss when his wife calls.

They wouldn\u2019t see a problem with her doing this. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything to me about not telling him about her call, nobody knew that I didn\u2019t tell him the first time. Really, I hadn\u2019t even gotten a chance to get up and tell him before she called again.", "No practice manage or anyone that\u2019s above me but below him, unfortunately.", "Holy crap that\u2019s insane. I\u2019ll stick to the annoying wife lol", "Then definitely don't start blowing her off without speaking to him first. She sounds insufferable, but also the kind of insufferable that will make your life miserable if you cross her.", "But it is part of her job.  Receptionist answer and route phonecalls and often schedule appointments.", "Naw naw naw, OP. First of all, \u201cwasting sticky notes\u201d, lol. Man\u2019s got an MD degree, he can afford sticky notes. Also, it would be a GREAT wake up call for him to see those five sticky notes. Put a timestamp on each one!", "Just keep doing that.  I was a front desk worker at a dental clinic. Part of the job is taking messages.\n\nIf you think its a waste of sticky notes, just write 1 and add the times of any other call.", "NO!!!  USE the sticky notes and make sure the date and time is on each one.  If he has a monitor on his desk that's where I'd leave them.", "So then just do what you should be doing: answering the phone and telling the Doctor about his urgent message (that message being whatever wife has to say)\n\nIts really no different than any other urgent message except you got it into your head that that it shouldn't be your responsibility. But it is.\n\nThats what you do: You answer the phones and tell the Doctor about it. Some stuff is filed away, some stuff is emailed and some stuff is urgent and goes right to him.\n\nHis wife is always urgent. Your thought process seems to be \"I could be doing my job if I didnt have to talk to her\" but what you fail to see is that IS a job when your in a family business and more importantly, her's and the Doctor's wishes are part of the business, so its not your place to decide how important it is for the two to speak", "Taking messages is part of OP's job though. It is decidedly not OP's job to hang up on the wife of one of the doctors.", "I agree.", "I mean, their marital issues aren't really your business? If someone calls for your boss, your job is to answer the phone and take a message. Just do that.", "Well, then OP is gonna have to get used to it I guess.", "Even if you\u2019re busy doing your actual job and you\u2019ve already listened to the person and explained to them you\u2019re busy?", "If he\u2019s the only doctor, then you work for him. Without him, there is no job. If it\u2019s a practice with multiple doctors, then take it to management.", "Lol good luck to you. You will always moonlight as a PA when you work for a Dr", "You don\u2019t have to interrupt him with patients. If you have multiple lines, stick her on hold indefinitely until he comes around.", "Yes, but you're getting paid to answer those lines.   She's a PITA but just be pleasant,  take deep breaths and put in your hours.  She sounds like she needs kid glove treatment so make her think you're the best employee he's ever had.", "I have worked jobs like this, and my solution would be:\n\nNext time she pulls this stunt, go on and interrupt him. Then ask him very directly, \u201cDo you want me to interrupt your patient visits for these calls in the future? Or should I take a message?\u201d \n\nIf he says yes, interrupt me, then make note and continue to deal with her. If he ever has any criticism about patients on hold, you get to pull that out of your back pocket and say, \u201cI totally get it, however, our lines are busy a lot with people trying to reach you. You\u2019d advised me to hold those calls for you. Would it be easier to take a message? Could we possibly invest in a more robust phone system with more lines?\u201d\n\nIf he says no, take a message, wonderful! Turning her away a few times should send a message.\n\nIt\u2019s a crappy situation, but let\u2019s be real\u2014this is the receptionist life. And unfortunately, it\u2019s his problem to fix, not yours.", "Your job is to pick up the phone, end of story.", "No, OP is NTA. The job description isn't \"Go tell this person that someone is on the phone for them.\" It is \"Take a message.\"  \n\n\nThat means \"Write down, on a piece of paper, that a person called and put that piece of paper in a place where they know to look for messages.\"", "It's not your job to understand. Your job is to pick up the phone and handle any call respectfully and fully. If your bothered by it, talk to the Dr. Let me make the clear for you first. Who do you think the Dr will side with.... His wife or a receptionist?", "Such an unhealthy work environment... Good luck OP, you have to be professional!", "Exactly! The purpose of people calling and her picking  up is booking appointments, cancelling appointments, giving information about relevant services to the patients.\n\nShe is *not* paid to be a personal assistant dealing with personal issues. \n\nPlus, this lady is not okay. If the same patient called 5 times in the span of few hours, it would get looked at at. This wife is doing this every day for personal reasons. It needs sorting.", "So that excuses the wife for making her job more difficult on a daily basis?", "She's a *medical receptionist,* not a personal assistant. Dealing with patients is her job, not dealing with unhinged behaviour from the doctor's wife.", "This is the way.   Get a visual going for him.  Its our job, unfortunately part of that job is to take messages.  Not to cherry pick them.", "Sorry for being an environmentalist lol but I guess a visual aid would help him understand", "I do see your point and somewhat agree with this perspective on it. Thanks for taking the time to comment", "OP took the message before they hung up? To continue doing the actual important part of their job aka dealing with patients? They even had to stop what they were doing to go bother the doctor during /surgery/ because the wife called again five minutes later?", "In general, for any customer service phone job, it is poor customer service to end a call without a proper closing. ESPECIALLY your boss\u2019 wife. Just hanging up on someone is big rude.", "I mean, unless he owns the practice, without him there would be another doctor doing his job\u2026. OP actually does not have to follow all of his demands, OP has a job which probably comes with a job description which is what they have to follow. (And somehow I doubt this is part of it)", "Okay that\u2019s true I guess lol", "The issue is I only have three lines and they often are taken up. So unless the phone is dead, I really can\u2019t do this. And I have tried before, she\u2019ll just hang up and keep calling back.", "This is good, thanks", "The last line.. facts!!", "I dont blame the frustration tho. I used to work for a family trucking company and the owners used to pull all kinds of shit.\n\nUsed to call us (the dispatch office) with no notice and tell us to pull drivers from important clients cause they needed someone to go pickup furniture and deliver it to their house\n\nDriver would get mad. Client would get mad. Warehouse would get mad. It'd be a bunch of extra work for me. Itd slip my mind that \"delivering furniture isnt my fucking job\" and then I'd realize that delivering shit is exactly my job, I was just mad that I couldnt tell the owner they had to follow procedure", "This is clearly a problem but it's a problem for the doctor to solve. Just hanging up on the wife is not stopping the behavior.", "She didn\u2019t just hang up though? She told her she was busy and she\u2019d forward the message. She didn\u2019t have time to do it because she was busy and doctor was in surgery and she calls back less than five minutes later, and then OP tells her the same thing and actually goes to talk to the doctor. \nPersonally I think it\u2019s ruder to bother medical staff and hold up lines actual patients need to use when it\u2019s obvious your husband is busy and can\u2019t talk to you at the moment.", "she's not a customer though", "OP\u2019s job description is \u201canswer the phone\u201d. I\u2019ve worked that job and I promise you that\u2019s the expectation. And it\u2019s a family business per some of their replies.", "But OP never did that? OP told the wife she would tell doctor she had called, then hung up to do her job.", "I mean, they did answer the phone. Three times. While extremely busy handling actual patients. Expecting OP to go and interrupt a doctor performing surgery for something that\u2019s not an emergency situation is the unreasonable part here. Telling the doctor when he came out of surgery that his wife called sounds like the most reasonable option to me tbh.", "For clarification, it\u2019s not a family business. He himself owns the business. His wife and kids work elsewhere. He owns another practice with his sister, but it is not the one I work at.", "Except that's not what OP did:\n\n> **I decided not to tell him** she called because he was in surgery and I\u2019m in the middle of a thousand things.\n\nI wouldn't expect her to immediately get up and interrupt a surgery, btw. Taking a message should be sufficient unless it's a true emergency.\n\nI feel like you're just looking for a fight here.  We can disagree about this, it's not personal.", "Not looking for a fight! Just have a different view, it\u2019s totally cool."]}
