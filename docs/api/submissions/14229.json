Maybe I don't understand what you're asking me here.", "Unless OP\u2019s dad adopted the sister they wouldn\u2019t be first cousins.", "Where I live, you can legally marry your whole cousin. \n\nHowever, in this case, the cousin isn\u2019t any relation at all. They\u2019re not half-cousins. They\u2019re nothing.", "What country is this? I'm curious where it's illegal to marry your adopted first cousin when genetics is not a factor.", "The cousin is from bio dad's side, and the half sister shares the same mom and a different father. This does not make them first cousins legally, morally, or anything.", "No, adopted means that they\u2019re part of the family legally. Half-siblings are not the same.\n\nLike if something happened to one of the fathers and they left money to all of their children, it would only go to one child not both. Because legally they\u2019re not his child.", "Cousins share a grandparent. \n\nThese do not. \n\nNot cousins.", ">From a legal standpoint they are first cousins though\n\nNo they aren't. They have no legal or genetic relationship. They do not share a grandparent.", "Lol, I actually drew out the chart, as squicky as it is legally they're fine. The bar in most jurisdictions is relatives up to the fourth degree (first cousins) by consanguinity (blood) or affinity (marriage). OP and sister share a mother, but have different fathers. Her cousin is related to her through her father, who has no legal connection to half-sister's father.", "My dad's mom maiden name and my mom's maiden name are the same.  They are probably related 5 or so generations back because they have some of the same weird genetic quirks that they passed to me and my brother. We aren't talking like illnesses or anything, but like the teeth next to your front teeth are called laterals.  No one in my immediate family has the permanent versions of those teeth.\n\nBut I've been to weddings where I've been related to the bride and the groom. It wasn't even weird where I'm from.  The bride and groom were only related to each other once.  (That one I did think a little weird.  They shared great grandparents.  I wouldn't date the groom because we shared great great grandparents.)", "Just because it's been done in the past doesn't make it right. What kind of response is that? \"Don't look into history, because it's been done.\" You got a ridiculous take on slavery too? \n\nUnless you're married to a family member and you're triggered?", "What used to be okay can also be currently weird. \n\nSaying something happened in the 1700s is a boring justification for why something is allowed now. It's a completely different world.", "Great grandparents", "It is in a lot of families, but one generation of mating with unrelated individuals erases all the potential effects of inbreeding, so as long as it was a couple of generations ago it won\u2019t have an effect on you.", "If a community lives isolated for long enough, everyone ends up related to everyone. Like Iceland.", "Tell that to South Asia", "My friends don't show up at family funerals, weddings, or holidays, but my cousin (who was adopted by my aunt and uncle) does. There may not be consanguinity between OP's sister and cousin, but there could still be a whole lot of family awkwardness should this relationship end.", "She's half-sisters with one and cousins with the other. They are both *her* family - she is related by blood to both of them, even though *they* are not related by blood to each other.", "Her mother and father are both blood related too her so is that weird for OP that they are together?", "She mentioned her dad was \"on the fence\" and didn't mention a different parent in the picture, and since she has such a strong relationship with the sister (doesn't call her half sister, speaks kindly of her), I figured that she was, but was uncertain hence the INFO I prefaced it with.", "Yes I understand, however op did not specify if the sister was adopted or not, but she also didn't mention any other father being in the sister's life. Hence why I asked for more info.", "I have great grandparents who were first cousins...and knew they were cousins when they met. As long as it is relatively rare, there is generally not much problem. It is the small communities with constant intermarriage where problems start to occur.", "Whoa! Are you related to me? My sisters and I are also misssing those same two teeth! The baby teeth were there, but the adult teeth never came in. I\u2019m lucky I had braces! No one can tell.", "When my grandmother passed away, my grandfather remarried to a woman who was his cousin 3 times. I have tons of cousins who are related to me more than once. I'm incredibly grateful that both my grandfather and father married out of that gene pool.", "I\u2019m missing those teeth too. Hiya cousin!", "My dad's mom and my mom also have the same maiden names. We don't know how closely they're related. As far as I know, they don't really have anything that's genetic in common.\n\nDid you leave off some last names in your family trees as a kid too?", "I live in a village of less than 700 folk. I concur. My grans cousin had three daughters who are also my cousins by marriage", "There's a state in Germany with a common joke that if you place two strangers at a table and they start conversing they'll discover they're related within 20min", "Yes, which makes these two nothing to each other except affianced. \n\nOP needs to butt out.", "How is this a comparable example? Why would this be weird to OP - it's not the same as growing up with two people in your family who had certain roles to OP - half sister and cousin who suddenly started something. This isn't really something you hear often about and even halfsister admitted they met in an unusual way. OP can feel how she wants but she can't change what they do.", "OP said they were half-sisters with different fathers. Clarifies that they\u2019re not blood related.\n\nI think if there was any adoption, it would have been mentioned.", "Me too", ">who are also my cousins by marriage\n\nhahaha - who cares?", "You're not disagreeing with anything I've said here then.", "Well it is the same. It\u2019s two completely unrelated people getting married", "Exactly. There\u2019s about ten surnames in my village with loads of folk so we\u2019ll be related back five hundred years or so", "Emotional and contextwise it's not for OP and again that's okay. Parents aren't related - they are married to each other. A halfsister and a cousin are related but not necessarily by blood (like in this case). So yeah OP is blood related to her parents but her parents aren't related to each other. So the situation is different for her. \n\nAgain, OP's behavior is not okay.", "In this case half-sister and cousin are absolutely not related in any way.  You make it sound like they both grew up attending the same family gatherings and events when they likely had little to no relationship prior to hooking up.  Why would half-sister have spent any significant amount of time with OP's father's family?", "They are cousins (half-sister and cousin) in OP's view. Which makes perfectly sense. Half-sister is still a sister for OP and that makes her cousin also half-sister's cousin (again in OP views). I made my point clear a few times and it's okay if you have a different opinion. I'll stop this conversation now."]}
