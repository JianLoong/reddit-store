Your girlfriend is confusing being assertive with being an Asshole. You can be firm and confident in your interactions when you've got grievances without being cruel or unkind. \n\nI recommend telling her the eta is always 15 minutes later than what they say when you order. That way if they're there earlier, she's happy, and if they're late, her frustration will feel more justified to you.", "NTA. In a moment when she is not hangry, have a discussion about her unreasonable request for you to yell at someone.", "NTA\n\nNext time she starts in with this bullshit.... Grab her phone and hand it to her/hand her your phone and say these magical words \"If you wanna call and complain, do it your god damn self!\". There's not much worse than a person that demands their SO be the person that files complaints to businesses. \n\nEspecially for the fact she demands you be rude/mean.... Seriously... REALLY immature.", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend is though. Surely she is old enough to know it's an ESTIMATED time not a set time, even then things happen.\n\nThrowing a tantrum like a toddler solves nothing. She needs to learn how to regulate her emotions and expectations better.", "NTA and why are you even questioning this?\nIn what world is \u201cI refuse to be a dick to people. AITA?\u201d a question that even needs to be asked?", "NTA\n\nYelling won't make your food come quicker. Fair enough if it's over 30 mins late call and enquire how long it will be, but there is no need to be rude", "Service jobs are hard enough as it is, your gf is behaving like a 37 year old toddler who yells for what they want because they haven't understood the concept of delayed gratification.\n\nFair enough to call, yelling is just unpleasant and unnecessary, you are right and absolutely NTA.\n\nThere's a well worn cliche about judging people based on how they treat the people who serve them ...", "People being rude to service providers is one of my litmus tests when dating. There is no second chance on this. One strike, you're out.\n\nWhy would you want to be with someone who treats other people like that?\n\nNTA but your girlfriend is, and you too if you enable it.", "NTA. I don't like having my food spit in either. \n\nYour girlfriend should adjust her expectations. Encourage her to double the timeframe any restaurant gives her, and then be pleasantly surprised if they come earlier.", "NTA. If she's that bothered she can call them and leave you out of it. Does she honestly think that the food will arrive earlier as a result of shouting and unpleasantness?", "NTA and yikes she's flashing some big red flags in your face here. Getting mad at the driver or restaurant doesn't help anything and only makes people look like A Hs. So she's ordering in, having someone cook for her and deliver it right to her door, and she feels it's appropriate to yell at them if it takes a few minutes too long... Just let that sink in..", "NTA. Sign your girlfriend up to deliver for doordash and see if she still wants to yell at people after she's completed a few hundred deliveries.", "Egads, she is hangry. Keep snacks on hand.\n\nNTA.  Anyone that has worked in the food service industry or done deliveries understands that life happens. No need to yell at anyone.", "NTA - she is. Yelling won't fix anything but you can express your disappointment and ask for a discount or something to make up for the lateness. But you certainly won't feel good about yelling at a stranger and it won't fix the problem. But it is what a\\*\\*holes do.", "NTA, your girlfriend is definitely an A", "NTA, but the GF very much is. She needs to figure out how to manage her hangries and not take them out on others. This includes figuring out that delivery takes time, especially in the Covid/post Covid era, and eat a snack if she needs to. I can\u2019t imagine talking my hangry out on a romantic partner to the point that I expect them to be horrible to service people on my behalf, when it\u2019s also totally irrational. I\u2019d be wondering if I needed to get medical help or mental health help or both. If I were a rational AH, which she isn\u2019t. Just an AH. You are not and I would recommend not even humoring her the slightest. Along with questioning whether I\u2019d want to stay in the relationship at all.", "NTA, frankly YWBTA if you did as your girlfriend requested, and honestly that she wants you to, and the fact that she isnt willing to do so herself presents a nice little pair of red flags", "Ask her if she wants to encourage people providing the food to violate the food in retaliation. No? Then chill a bit. Yelling seldom helps anything.", "NTA\n\nKeep a pocketful of mini-snickers unless you want the restaurant to add some special sauce or dressing.", "You and your girlfriend are both the assholes. Complaining about late deliveries when you admit it's not exactly easy to find the correct entrance to your building and the delivery is less than 10 minutes late is ridiculous.\n\nDelivery times are estimates. You could learn to tell her to call herself, and she could learn some patience. Alternatively, she can get off her lazy ass and go pick it up herself.\n\nYour girlfriend is entitled, and you enable her by doing the dirty work on her behalf.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
