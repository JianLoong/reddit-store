She was betting on him not telling me out of fear of what I would do to him - but we communicate and don't hide things.

Nor was he in trouble with me more than an ass chewing because really that was a dumb choice - but he has not made that bad choice before - so his honestly and apologizing and taking responsibility for his actions made it hard to be pissed at him for long.

So, me being a good girlfriend, very angrily, but at the same time trying to be caring, helped him to go to bed. He apologized so much on the next day. Now that I look back, it was so funny, but I guess I was too hormonal to see it back then \ud83d\ude02", "LMAO!!!! See, drunk me thinks I am still in my 20's and can move like I am in my 20's. So I do dumb shit like climb tree's, climb on roofs, think I can pole dance!!!! I am 50! I wake up the next morning and my body is like....what in the HELL were you thinking!?!?!?!?", "[Here you go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuanwn3v-2I) I love this song, too, and just had to listen to it!", "Upvote back please", "Fucking adorable. I can so hear mine doing the exact same thing! Seriously I laughed out loud and scared the cat on my lap. The tiny honk honk just killllls me", "Not a typo, a sad consequence of multiple shame buckets", "We have that too in German! Betrunkene und Kinder sagen die Wahrheit", "Every year is quicker and quicker.   I remember SCOFFING at my dad when he said the years flew by.    Now I am stunned when every birthday comes around -  weren't we just here?\n\nInterestingly though, the same phenomenon doesn't happen to me at X-mas.  Every October or so I start to think -   welp, this year went by too fast for me to properly enjoy X-mas this year.  It's going to feel like it came too quickly.   But sure enough, partway through December I'm like \"Christmas time is here and is magical!!\"", "I think a lot of people drink for that reason, getting away with stuff they want to do, but h\u00e9 don't blame me I was \"drunk.\"", "Yeah... it warps me into something I am not and would never EVER want to be, especially when I black out. Some of my words that I've had to hear secondhand are fucking shameful. \n\nI'm thankfully 4+ years sober, though.", "For real. It might loosen your inhibitions but it doesn't make you start saying everything you know truthfully. If that was the case, there'd be no need for torture or interrogations. \n\nNot proud of it, but I've been at my most manipulative when drunk on more than one occasion.", "That is so cute and sweet I can\u2019t evennnn", "This wins internet for me tonight \ud83d\ude02", "This sounds so intense! Love it!!", "Popeyes' version is the box of a dozen biscuits. Double Honey butter.", "Omg there's a Popeyes opening up near me soon and I desperately need a Shame Bucket!", "They do everything in boxes. KFC probably has a lock on buckets, lol. They really SHOULD make a bucket of shame however. I would totally indulge in that!", "Add a fourth and I\u2019ll bring some whiskey.", "Oof. My friend in college once had wine and KFC one night and threw up for a long time. He swore KFC off after that. KFC and wine is a dangerous combo", "Your finest cardbordeau! (Boxed wine)", "Shameful and stingy", "Do \u201c*not*\u201d put Tito\u2019s in sweet tea \u2026 it\u2019s dangerous", ">I'm unfortunately unfamiliar with Patton Oswalt,\n\nWell THAT is a problem you should rectify immediately! His stand up was awesome.", "Oh you\u2019re not alone! My girlfriends and I will attempt to relive our 20s and wake up with UPIs - unidentified party injuries.", "Welp. I know what\u2019s for dinner.", "Make it extra crispy with side of mashed potatoes & gravy.", "Go ahead and add a fifth of each, I\u2019ll venmo\n\n*Double-entendre finger guns*", "I am immune to any kind of wine related problems. I live in France. Wine = water", "That\u2019s the *other* use for the shame bucket.", "Now I have something to check out when I get free time.", "\ud83d\udc80 - UPIs is an amazing term.", "I'm stealing UPI omg\ud83e\udd23 reminds me of when I got blackout drunk while camping, fell in the campfire, woke up with burns and came out like \"uh wtf happened to me\" hahaha", "Are you my SO? He is guilty as charged of the same language crime.", "I feel like I might the only person that prefers the original recipe over extra crispy. I'm gross and I like greasy chicken skin.", "Dibs on the biscuits!", "CORN! Don't forget the SWEET CORN! Please. And tyvm. Kisses.", "Don't forget the coleslaw. Their colelsaw is so good.\n\nOoh, and biscuits!", "Was KFC the one that used to have the chocolate chocolate chip cake? \ud83e\udd24 \ud83d\ude0b", "I'm Polish (well, American Polish but my mom is Polish Polish) and joke that I can handle my vodka well because of that.", "Is he really cute and obsessed with languages and reptiles? And a woman? If so, I'm him.", "When I had my wisdom teeth out I lived on KFC mashed potatoes and gravy for a week!", "Can I get one of those pudding cups they sell along with that KFC Shame Bucket? \n\nDamn. Now I know what I'm having for dinner tomorrow night. \ud83c\udf57", "I prefer original recipe, too. Extra crispy is too bready.", "I love the original, but I'm allergic to something in it that's either not in the crunchy, or maybe diluted; idk, but my mouth swells and gets all patchy when i eat the original \ud83d\ude2a", "Fun fact, since I worked at kfc... set it on parchment paper for like 5-10 min, or just let it sit in its own juices in general... you'll get your greasy chicken skin, even if it's extra crispy", "Put honey on them\ud83e\udd24", "The biscuits are the best part.", "I call the fries!", "Yeah I'm just in it for the coleslaw and chicken skins", "Yes, no, yes, and he's a casual drag artist so--sometimes--. Dang, missed by a mark!", "The gravy tastes fake as fuck and yet still delicious. Especially if you have some potato wedges to dip in it. \n\nAny person who would choose corn over gravy in any situation deserves to have their sanity questioned.", "Damn KFC for keeping their 11 herbs and spices a secret recipe.", "You clearly don't live in the UK to want the fries haha", "So close. I think we should all be friends"]}
