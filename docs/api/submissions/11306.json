If you are black out drunk, you don't remember shit. She obviously did unless I missed where the OP said she told her sister what she did.\nAnd wtf people, if that had been a man doing that to a woman, all you shitting on OP would be calling for a lynch mob, burn the skies, it was sexual assault,, etc...but cause it was a girl, OP should have kept her mouth shut. GTFO.. \nOP, you are definitely NTA. She knew what she was doing. I've never sexually assaulted anyone drunk and if I had been your sisters spouse, I would be so happy that you told me.", "Did she stop drinking? Was she so appalled by what she did that she apologised to your boyfriend and stopped drinking?\nWe know she didn't tell her husband, say how horrified she was and try to make amends but did she do anything that expressed remorse?\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf your sister wanted to spin a story, she should have at the very least got you to agree with that story first.

Drink responsibly but have fun.", "NTA- her own actions caused it, drunk or not she still did it.", "NTA\nIf your BF got drunk, sexually assaulted her, and then lied to cover it up, how would she feel? She'd expect you to leave him and support her, right? Why is she surprised her husband has left, even temporarily.", "NTA\n\nBeing black out drunk is an explanation not an excuse. He should be mad at you too for waiting this long to say anything.", "NTA. She fucked around and found out.", "NTA it's on her to reach out to you on whether you tell her husband and if she doesn't, that's on her. Either way, it's your choice if you tell her husband or not, not hers. That's what she gets for involving another party and of all people your partner. Being drunk is never an excuse for assault and her husband deserves to know that she's like that. She could even be like that around other men than just your boyfriend too.", "**NTA - She ruined her own life.** Her husband had a right to know, and you told him the truth instead of lying like she did. \n\n>She said ... I know that isn\u2019t her true character.\n\nI have a suspicion it *is* her true character.", "Nta, but you should had told him sooner. Think that if she did it once, she prob did it before", "NTA.  I've been drunk plenty and never sexually assaulted someone. And she for sure remembers doing it, why else make up the lie about puking on your bed being a reason you aren't talking?", "NTA.\n\nShe fucked around, now she's finding out. I hope this is a wake up call for her to stop drinking until she blacks out. That's not healthy for anyone.", "So your sister sexually assaulted your boyfriend but you ruined her life? \n\nNTA, getting blackout drunk is no excuse. When my husband gets blackout drunk he orders a family bucket from KFC to himself and calls it a shame bucket.  Maybe she's just pissed off because her true character is coming to light.", "I wouldn't go so far as to say you're TA but you shouldn't have done it. You have every right to be upset with her and want nothing to do with her, but it was a mistake to meddle in their relationship. The chances are he will forgive her and they will go back to pretending nothing ever happened, but you will be vilified because they will need *someone* to blame for their fight and you've made yourself an easy target for their misplaced anger. \n\nYou should have told him that that's not the case, that you're upset with her for personal reasons that you don't wish to divulge and told him to talk to your sister. Then you should have messaged her a single time, called her out for lying to her husband about you and tell her to tell him the truth.", "NTA , she is lucky not to be sued for sexual assault", "If she was really black out drunk, she wouldn\u2019t remember the details", "YTA. If she was that drunk, was she even aware of what happened?

You doing it now shows it\u2019s about revenge which IMO makes YTA", "NTA. Her husband needed to know he can't trust her. She knew what happened and then lied on top of it to him.  \n\nHe needs to reevaluate everything he thought he knew about her. And he should.", "Your sister is a creep. \n\nNTA", "NTA. But I am confused by your sister's actions. If she were black-out drunk, then why the lie? Was she not supposed to drink that much if at all? Or did she know what she was doing, and lied about being black-out drunk to alleviate her guilt? Did you know she was black-out drunk two months ago, and how so? Because she sounds like a mega liar with some kind of problem.\n\nShe shouldn't have lied and put you in that position regardless of the answers to the above.", "Eh no it's your sister not some stranger, obviously she wouldn't tell your BIL the truth so you did good to say it, NTA.", "NTA I am tired of people hiding their bad behavior behind being drunk\n\nI've been black out drunk before. My friends had to tell me what happened during that time. \n\nDo you know what happened? I had to be fed fried rice like a baby because I couldn't hold the spoon and also I just chatted to everyone I met (nicely). I never tried to sexually assault anyone.\n\nPeople who do that shit are already bad.", "NTA.  She made a move on your boyfriend.  Your boyfriend, her husband, and you are the victims here for her actions.  She ruined her own life, not you", "NTA - You were willing to let it be whatever it was, but your sister felt the need to lie about it. If it really wasn't a big deal, and really wasn't part of her character, then she should have been open and honest with her husband from the start. Likely, it wasn't the act that caused the husband to leave, but the months of lies about it.", "YTA\n\n\"Thats not what happened. Talk to your wife.\"\n\nBut yeah go ahead and ruin your relationship with your sister if that's your prerogative.", "im going with NTA on this one\n\nShe earned this", "Apparently op is just supposed let their sister get away with it. Yeah she SA someone, but hey, she was drunk.

If it was any other guy and they didn't reject her, she totally would have fucked someone.", "Okay... But her sister is lying on her name which isn't okay!

Its not OP's fault the sister is now facing the consequences lol", "So op should just let their sister lie and get away with SA their bf??? Her husband contacted op directly about it, so op had every right to tell him the truth. It\u2019s not like op gave up the information without being prompted.

These are consequences of the sister lying to her husband.", "Her sister ruined her relationship with OP when she assaulted OPs BF.", "Def not excusing the sis\u2019s unacceptable \u201cdrunk\u201d behavior. IMO it\u2019s not appropriate for OP to talk to her bro-in-law about it without talking to the sis as well, unless OP plans to just never speak to sis again in her life and doesn\u2019t care what happens to her or their relationship \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I just think that if you have a problem with someone\u2019s behavior you should address it with that person. IMO OP should have brought it up to her sister if she wants to maintain a relationship with her. If OP doesn\u2019t care about her relationship with her sister then it doesn\u2019t matter either way.", "Sis shouldn\u2019t have spent two months boo-hooing about the lie that made OP into the bad guy if she didn\u2019t want OP to set the record straight.", "Think of it this way, had the sister (who undoubtedly knew what she'd done because she told her husband the tension between her and OP was due to being \"sick\" in OP's room) been honest with her husband, none of this would have happened.\n\nThis is all on the sister as far as I'm concerned. She's had months to come clean and didn't.  Did she even apologize to OP and her husband?", "It was bro-in-law that spoke to the OP, suddenly springing an unexpected lie. Sis being stupid enough not to get OP on board with lie first is on sis.", "Thanks for your comment, I def misunderstood OP. I thought both the bed puking and the assault had happened and was giving sis the benefit of the doubt that she thought the bed puking was why OP was upset and didn\u2019t specifically remember the assault. I didn\u2019t realize the bed puking was an outright fabrication. So yeah, that\u2019s all on the sis."]}
