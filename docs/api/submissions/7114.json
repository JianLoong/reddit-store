People who don't craft don't understand how much time effort and material cost go into it. It takes longer to make larger things. It's more expensive too. It's not a machine cranking out a larger garment, it's hours of my time. I'd probably tell Steph that I am no longer interested in crafting for her since she called me fatphobic for simple truth.", "Nope. The cost is dependent on the cost of raw materials AND the time you put into making it. She is just cheap and trying to scam you. Molly can make her \"friend\" the sweater herself. NTA.", "NTA. Fellow crocheter here. Larger project = more yarn, more of your time. You aren\u2019t the AH and you\u2019re certainly not fatphobic for wanting to be compensated properly. Sadly a lot of people that aren\u2019t crafters don\u2019t understand just how much your materials and time is worth.", "NTA, I buy mostly handmade or second hand clothes, so big difference in prices\n\n \nYou don't like the price, you move on, handicraft is expensive and you can go to shein if want cheap\n\n\nMolly shouldn't tell her friend how much she paid in first place, she contacted her with you and it's you who tell the price.", "NTA\n\nIt takes more time, effort and yarn to make it.\n\nFor any future instances, I would say price varies by number of stitches.", "NTA - I also like to crochet. I mostly do blankets and sometimes stuffed animals. Asking for a larger sweater for the same price as a small sweater is the same as asking for a larger blanket. Good yarn isn\u2019t cheap. And my time isn\u2019t free. You\u2019re not being fat phobic.", "NTA.  If you used more wool it's going to cost more. That's not fatphobic. \n\nI know if you buy something in a shop you don't usually pay more for a larger size, but this is a handmade item.   Explain that the cost is related to the amount of yarn purchased (even though there's labour as well) and leave the ball in her court.", "You are absolutely NTA. Crochet one of the last arts unable to be created by a machine, absolutely you should charge what it is worth. Larger sizes cost more across industries, they literally have more material and labor invested into them. If she wants a handmade sweater for less she can find another artist to work with. She will absolutely get what she pays for and perhaps that is a lesson she needs to learn. I hear TEMU has clothing.", "NTA\n\nYou're not a garment machine cranking out hundreds of a product of different varieties with ease; you are hand-making each, buying materials for customized work and labor is very much specs dependent. Calling you \"fatphobic\" is ridiculous. You're not rejecting her as a client for being fat. You're rejecting her for being cheap. Unless you're unreasonably doubling the price, a few added $$ but still cheaper than shops is still a good deal.\n\nI would suggest she provide all the materials then you charge her for labor, but for being aggressively unpleasant, I'd probably just say I'm too loaded to take on another project from her... ever, until she apologizes.", "NTA more yarn+more time= more expensive.", "NTA. I am a larger person and I expect that, especially, a handmade item is going to cost more.", "NTA. You\u2019ve explained exactly your pricing model. Is it too late to say you charged Molly less because she\u2019s a close friend but mate\u2019s rates don\u2019t extend to friends of friends?", "FYI-it is customary around the world to sell handmade items in accordance with the materials and time involved. You are doing things exactly as everyone else does.", "NTA doesn't a 20oz anything usually cost more than an 8oz same thing?\n\nMore time, money, and material the higher the price.", "100% NTA - I am also a crocheter. I own my own small business where we hand-make everything. Unfortunately for both us, handmade small businesses, and the consumer, we do have to charge more for bigger sweaters. You aren\u2019t a big box store deciding to fat shame and charge more just cause it\u2019s a bigger size; you literally have to take more time, and more yarn. She\u2019s projecting her pain onto you, as unfair as it is. Only two ways to go: 1) either stick to your guns and explain that you are making this by hand and it takes more yarn and time to make a larger garment, thus more money, it has nothing to do with shame. Or 2) concede your ground and lower your price. Personally, I would never be shamed into lowering my price. You asked me to make something, this is my price. Take it or leave it. I\u2019m not about to put in time and effort just to ripped off by someone who obviously doesn\u2019t appreciate it.", "NTA. You gotta set your prices as make sense and you\u2019re doing this as a hobby, not a business. If they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to buy it. Have you explained your pricing plan?", "NTA. Stores charge the same price per item in a lot of different sizes because they\u2019re mass produced and they have a huge markup anyway. That said, some of the much larger sizes still cost more. \n\nIt takes more time and more materials to make a handmade sweater, so it should be understandable that you charge accordingly.", "Nta a simple message saying \u201cmy prices aren\u2019t per item, I need to charge x amount to cover x amount of materials and x amount of time spent. Each item I make is priced according to how many skeins of wool it took to make the difficulty of the stitch used and the amount of time, you being a different size to Molly has nothing to do with it.\u201d", "NTA\n\nYou are free to set the price. Particularly if it is based on time and materials. \n\nHe is free to shop elsewhere.", "NTA.  I\u2019m a tall woman and have to pay extra for tall sizes all the time. Sucks, but that\u2019s life.", "NTA You're charging based on materials. It would cost more if Steph was significantly taller, too.", "NTA\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you like the sweater I made for my friend Molly. I am happy to make you one also, but need to at least cover my costs (for materials and time). The price I quoted reflects that. If you are unwilling to pay that much, I\u2019ll be unable to make you a sweater.\u201d", "NTA.  Larger garments require more fabric.  Obviously a bigger one is going to cost more.", "NTA. That is the price of a charge\u2026 She can take it or leave it.", "NTA and I\u2019m a larger person. Retail stores sell plus sizes for more than the same thing in regular sizes. It isn\u2019t fatphobic, you aren\u2019t telling her she\u2019s fat and that\u2019s why you are charging more. I assume you explained how you price, x amount per stitch, it covers labor and material. The pricing is done the same for everyone. If you were charging Steph twice what you charged Molly because Steph is bigger that would be fatphobic. I could also see Molly getting a \u201cclose friends discount\u201d but you aren\u2019t even doing that. Steph knows the way things are when us bigger ladies purchase clothing and she shouldn\u2019t be taking it out on you. Tell Steph the price and she can take it or leave it. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to you in any way to lower the price because Steph is bigger. If Molly had gotten the sweater from Etsy and they did the pricing the way you do would Steph have complained then? Probably not, she thinks she can get a better deal because you and Molly are friends and that isn\u2019t right.", "NTA. You're selling by the stitch. That's perfectly reasonable. You wouldn't sell a baby blanket and a queen size blanket for the same price.", "NTA. You're running your sweater-making business as any small business would. \n\nYou account for the materials and the time taken to make a garment, and price accordingly. It would be like having an artist charge the same for a quick drawing compared to an oil-painted canvas.", "NTA -- I assume you would similarly up-charge Molly if she wanted an intentionally oversized style of sweater, and would charge Steph less if she wanted a tiny \"shrug\" sweater or a scarf.   \n\nFirst off, you can charge whatever you want.  And if you want to feel \"justified\" about your prices, be as transparent and consistent about your pricing model as possible (x for materials, y for labor, z for baseline project costs, whatever makes sense for you) and let customers make their own choices.", "NTA.\n\nYou make it, you get to set the price.\n\nFrankly, this has always irked me. I typically wear a small or medium and have always wondered why I am paying the same amount as the guy wearing an xl. It's half the freaking material.", "NTA.  Your product, your choice.  Just make sure you charge everyone based on your time and materials.  That isn\u2019t being fat phobic, that\u2019s being fair.", "NTA- I mean it's not unreasonable to expect an item that uses more material and takes more time to cost more. As a fat person when I buy a Xl or XXL shirt it always costs more than if I bought a medium or large.", "NTA", "NTA. Larger clothes are more expensive to create. If she were by a product from a store she would pay more.", "NTA - I don\u2019t even have much of an explanation here because its pretty cut and dry. \n\nI think your friend is a pretty big AH though cause your friends and family should be the most supportive, not looking to exploit and disrespect your time. \n\nIt\u2019s tacky to argue about the price of something you\u2019re getting from a small business, especially your friend.", "NTA and you need to charge time and materials on this one lol", "NTA, show her a break down of the cost of yarn for each sweater.  but in the future maybe price all your sweaters at the 'max' price.", "Tell Steph you will make something with the same number of stitches for her.  I hope she likes her crop top sweater.", "NTA.  Sewing related, embroidery also charged by the stitches plus material plus labor. Large ones cost more than small. I'm sure you find evidence of that in online forums, groups.  I see it all the time. Don't let them make you feel guilty.", "NTA. I am a painter and I charge by size. Bigger canvas = more materials, more time, more $. It\u2019s not just arts & crafts who price this way. Time x Materials is standard way of pricing Jobs in construction and manufacturing, too.\n\nIt\u2019s not about how much the customer weighs. For that matter, a larger person could order a cropped shrug cardigan and a smaller person could order a floor-length duster, and you\u2018d charge the smaller person more.", "I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone the size route. I would have just said the Molly got the friend discount because she is your friend. Steph is getting the regular price because she is not.", "NTA. It takes more time and materials. She knows she is a bigger person just tell her it costs more because it has more raw materials and will take longer. Do not under sell yourself", "Nta. And as someone who does crochet, pricing by stitches is brilliant.", "NTA. Decline the commission. You charge per stitch, and they'll never accept that. They don't respect what you do. The fact that they threw out a slur at you is just the icing on the cake.", "NTA. Good yarn is expensive and your time is expensive too. You should charge more if a project is going to take more time and materials", "NTA. It is very common to find larger shirts to have a higher price. XXL $2 more, then a M for instance. There is a difference in the amount of material. You are making this sweater by hand and have stated it will take less time. This makes perfect sense to charge less. Molly is being ridiculous.", "NTA. If Steph wants a sweater from you, you dictate the price. If she doesn't like the price, tough cookies, she can shop elsewhere.", "NTA. I am a very big lady and a knitter. I agree with you. The more materials and time equals higher cost.", "NAH. It's entirely possible that the potential client doesn't know how much of a difference in time and materials there is. Clients aren't used to this kind of pricing as most of our clothing is mass produced.  More transparent pricing up front might help solve this problem. You can let people know a little about what your estimates are based on. \n\nYou can also look at other fiber artists to see how they price their pieces. I can't say I see that most people are charging significantly more with each size increase but prices do vary.", "INFO: What was the price difference? I'm leaning towards NTA because I understand the time and material differential, and maybe even just charging more because the stranger isn't a friend of yours. But I'd want to know how much more you're charging.", "NTA. Larger sizes costing more is fat phobic when corporations do it. THEY'RE mass producing things and can/ should spread the cost so that it's reimbursed across sales of all sizes.

Also, it is clear that you do not intend to discriminate against Steph based on her body size, You are only pricing your item based on the time, effort and materials used. It is understandable that you don't want to undervalue your own work.

It's more work and material to make an XL than a small.  You're one person, you're not a factory that overcharges every size and thus can eat the difference.

You are being very insensitive", "[deleted]", "NTA. It\u2019s 100% fatphobic when corporations mass-producing things for pennies on the dollar do it. A $10 profit vs. a $9.50 profit on items that sell by the hundreds and thousands of units is something a multi-million or billion dollar corporation can afford to absorb - pricing things differently in that situation is just being greedy and charging fat people extra for the crime of needing bigger clothing. \n\nBut this is not mass-production. This is handmade, one-of-a-kind textile art. This is *your* time, effort, and material. You charge per stitch. Bigger items need more stitches. More stitches translates to more material, effort, and time. Ergo, a sweater for an XL person costs more than a sweater for an XS person. A crocheted bikini would surely cost less than a maxi-dress, yes? Same principle. If this Steph person actually values your monetary investment into materials and your time/labor investment into learning and honing a skill like crocheting, she can suck it up and pony up the cash. If not, her cheap ass can go look elsewhere for a nice handmade sweater, imo.", "It's also because at that level the amount of material used, the sizes average out to medium/large, so it's priced to the median size", "This!!!

You could try to explain that with numbers, citing the cost differences just in the yarn used, but then she'd probably ask why you're charging for more than that price (because people do not respect fiber arts and do not expect us to pay ourselves - I have priced it out for people before as to why I would charge what I said and why I gave the time frame I did... people either respected that or didn't ask again).

Even in stores larger items  can be marked up. Why would she expect a handmade item to be cheaper when it takes more of everything to make it? \n\nIf I were you I'd work out a spread sheet breaking down the costs based on your previous sweater. Show how much each skein of yarn costs, how many skeins you used, and your fee for your time. Make it hourly or a flat commission fee so it's easy for her to understand. Then make another sheet showing the estimated numbers for the larger sweater so she can compare the prices and see you're not charging her for her body shape, you're charging her for materials and time at the same rate as you charged your other friend.\n\nMolly is suggesting you sell yourself short to keep the piece and because she herself doesn't understand everything that went into her sweater.
