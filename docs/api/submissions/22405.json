It seems here that you have only agreed to have your sister live with you so she can babysit/do chores and basically be a live in maid and nanny for your benefit. If she isn't able to look after the kids for whatever reason then it's your responsibility to find and fund a sitter, not hers. \n\nIf you don't want her living with you for these reasons then that's totally your choice, but you stand to lose $500 plus somebody who helps out a lot by the sounds of it.Would you and your family be better off if she wasn't there Vs is she was?

If you want to go out on a date night, then either ask your sister nicely and be happy if she can spare her time (which she could be using working, studying or out with her boyfriend/friends) for free to help you, but if she cannot either don't go on the date or pay the sitter yourselves, as your sister should not have to be put out financially for kids she did not have, especially when she is already paying you a decent amount it rent (that seems to come from your parents)! \n\nIf I were your sister, I would also want to move out into student accommodation as I would feel very upset at the way I was being treated by my sister in this situation.", "YTA.

Room and board for $500 plus some babysitting I\u2019d be first in line to sign my child up.", "I haven't seen any by op yet. But she was vague on purpose most likely then.", "Can you subtract the cost of her food from that? $300.", "Depending on how many kids there are, many babysitters would charge $20-30/hr, possibly more with meal prep involved.\nOP, look at how much it would cost for a good sitter in your area for your kids to have a good idea of the value you get from this.\n$300/mo for one person's share of food for joint meals also seems a bit high to me but that also depends on cost of living and diet.", "Her boyfriend is  good kid and is allowed in our home. Since she has the basement to herself he even spends the occasional night.", "well. yeah, because her sister needed a place to stay and she gave her cheap rent. this is the trade off", "You did say at the start of your post the $500 covers her food.", "There is no world in which adding one person to a family of four adds $300 to the food budget, unless you are really bad at shopping.", "Oh wow. That\u2019s way \u201ccooler\u201d than I expected. Her reaction is definitely odd then. Maybe she\u2019s just tired of having to work her life around it. I had to stay with my parents every other weekend to be near a job to make pocket money during college. As the years went on it got really annoying that I knew when friends were planning things that I couldn\u2019t go because I\u2019d be up in the burbs working til 10pm. But we don\u2019t all get what we want. She\u2019s being a brat about the situation.", "We both know that 500/mo + additional duties is not a cheap deal for a room in someone elses house. It would be cheap for a studio. It would be cheap if it were the price at the dorms.", "Yes but part of her rent was babysitting. If she's not doing that why should I supply food?"]}
