It seems here that you have only agreed to have your sister live with you so she can babysit/do chores and basically be a live in maid and nanny for your benefit. If she isn't able to look after the kids for whatever reason then it's your responsibility to find and fund a sitter, not hers. \n\nIf you don't want her living with you for these reasons then that's totally your choice, but you stand to lose $500 plus somebody who helps out a lot by the sounds of it.Would you and your family be better off if she wasn't there Vs is she was? From my view, even with added childcare costs you would be financially better off with her living with you and paying rent and helping out when she can. \n\nOverall you should not blackmail your sister into paying for your children's childcare when you are not around, as the children are not her responsibility despite whatever you put in writing. If you want to go out on a date night, then either ask your sister nicely and be happy if she can spare her time (which she could be using working, studying or out with her boyfriend/friends) for free to help you, but if she cannot either don't go on the date or pay the sitter yourselves, as your sister should not have to be put out financially for kids she did not have, especially when she is already paying you a decent amount it rent (that seems to come from your parents)! \n\nIf I were your sister, I would also want to move out into student accommodation as I would feel very upset at the way I was being treated by my sister in this situation.", "YTA.

It sounds like there is a lot unsaid about how much help she is around the house. If the agreement is 2 nights a month, that\u2019s like $2-300 to pay a babysitter a month that you are saving. But that\u2019s a lot of money for a college student.  Why does the date night have to be every other Saturday? Does she do more than twice a month?

It sounds like the $500 is coming from parents. So keep that. But if you want to include childcare, you should pay her something or come up with like 8 hours of her time that you can mutually agree on she can babysit in the month. Anything over she is paid. And if she cancels, you reschedule but you plan ahead with her the hours. Maybe she doesn\u2019t make $25/hr if it\u2019s over the agreed like a normal babysitter, maybe $20.

More water usage, higher electricity bill, more food expenses, more wear and tear on the house. He paid a flat for for everything, so 1 bill for rent, food, water, electricity.

If a friend crashes on my couch that doesn't cost me money.", "Dorms often cost more because students are paying for meals or a meal plan, there are cleaning staff to clean.  Sometimes they have residential life programming.  I lived in a dorm where the whole floor shared a large bathroom, toilet stalls, showers, etc.  Only cleaning we had to do was make our beds and keep our rooms clean.    \n\n\nI think a lot of this depends on   \n\n\n1. where they live and what the cost of a share would be\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. how much housework and childcare OP expects sister to do.  It may go beyond the 2 Saturdays.  For example, does she have to get the kids up, fed and dressed for school?  Does she have to do either the am or pm school runs?  Does she have to give them dinner and get them ready for bed?

Letting them live rent free without a rental contract in my home is not one of them.\n\nFrankly, I would just rather give you a sum of money - that I can afford - than have that person move into my spare bedroom. People are shockingly misinformed about how expensive it can be - above and beyond mortgage payments and homeowner's insurance and property tax - to be a home owner.", "Ay yo what do you mean \"giving up my wife\"???", "So you\u2019d be cool with them crashing on your couch for 3-4 years for free?", "True, but considering it sounds like basically a basement apartment, they could easily rent it to someone else. That would be about $1000k here, on the low end. They\u2019ve basically agreed to take a hit on half the potential rent for two nights of babysitting a month, cooking two meals a week and doing light housework. \n\nSo if it would easily rented, it\u2019s costing them $500 in lost rental revenue if sister did nothing; with her doing chores as outlined OP probably breaks even.", "The college I went to and my kids did food was never part of the dorm fee.  There was always a separate food plan.  There was also no cleaning staff, you cleaned your own room.", "People want kids but don\u2019t want to parent", "I so agree with you. That's just harsh for a sister and way too quick of an escalation. The first step is to sit down and have a friendly but frank discussion to try to clarify the fundamental issues and maybe work things out. Maybe there's a way and maybe there's not, but immediately jumping to a situation of treating a sister like a court case and acting like you are a corporate apartment building property manager is ridiculous. \n\nShe's family. She's \"a good kid\". She's eight years younger. Maybe part of it is miscommunication about expectations. That's a half a generation gap difference right there so communication might not be perfect. Perhaps that gap might turn out to be an insurmountable problem at this particular and specific stage in their lives because they have different needs but there's no reason to turn it into a permanent break and long term resentment. The sister is not the same person at 20 as she was at 18. And she shouldn't be, otherwise her last two years in college were a waste of time. Life evolves. They can sit down and try to make things smoother. Act like family. Legalese is not the way I would want to go. That suggestion is pathetic, frankly. \n\nSure, the situation *could* get to that point if things escalate and the sister becomes stubborn and whatever, but there's no reason to race there any sooner than is necessary. She is going to be OP's sister for 60 more years. Give that some serious consideration. In the big picture, this is a blip. Or it will be if the OP doesn't consciously try to handle it in a way that will cause a long term rupture in relations. That would be monumentally stupid. Believe me, I've seen that up close. Some situations warrant that.This one does not.", "Ah, when I asked a specific person where they were paying $475 for room and utilities, not food.\nBeing that you are talking about just a room in OK that doesn\u2019t cover food or utilities.", "OPs sister isn't crashing there for free. What point were you trying to make tho?", "$1000k?? Idk where you live but a million dollars sounds like way too much for a basement apartment.", "That's...an odd conclusion to draw. You can't lose revenue you never actually had, and OP hasn't made any statement about planning to rent out their basement but avoiding it to accommodate their sister.", "We had communal bathrooms, shared by around 20+ women living on the same floor.  You couldn't store your stuff in the bathroom, we had buckets we kept all the bathroom stuff in and would carry them back and forth.\n\nThere was a study lounge and tv lounge shared by the entire dorm.  And a laundry room.  Those were communal rooms, and the cleaning lady and janitor cleaned those.\n\nMost of us were respectful and cleaned up after ourselves.  It was  really sad, one day the cleaning lady was asking us if we drank because she never had to clean up vomit on our floor.  We always cleaned our own.  Or whoever was sober enough in the group that was drinking would clean it because we didn't think it was right to leave that mess for her.  Apparently that wasn't standard.\n\nBasically we just had to clean our rooms.  It was 2 beds, 2 desks, 2 bureaus and 2 closets.  No sitting area.\n\nBut there were suites in other dorms.  They'd have 6 people sharing 3 bedrooms with one bathroom and a sitting room.\n\nI moved off campus after sophomore year with 3 other women.  We each had our own room, split the utilities and took turns cleaning, at least in theory.  It was cheaper than dorm living.  \n\n\nI think this is going to vary depending upon the area, etc.", "Just a note--my mum was a SAH MOM", "She made a few comments\u2014 one two say that she works weekends and is expected to cook twice a week.
