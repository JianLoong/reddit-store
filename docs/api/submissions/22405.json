It seems here that you have only agreed to have your sister live with you so she can babysit/do chores and basically be a live in maid and nanny for your benefit. If she isn't able to look after the kids for whatever reason then it's your responsibility to find and fund a sitter, not hers. \n\nIf you don't want her living with you for these reasons then that's totally your choice, but you stand to lose $500 plus somebody who helps out a lot by the sounds of it.Would you and your family be better off if she wasn't there Vs is she was?

If you want to go out on a date night, then either ask your sister nicely and be happy if she can spare her time (which she could be using working, studying or out with her boyfriend/friends) for free to help you, but if she cannot either don't go on the date or pay the sitter yourselves, as your sister should not have to be put out financially for kids she did not have, especially when she is already paying you a decent amount it rent (that seems to come from your parents)! \n\nIf I were your sister, I would also want to move out into student accommodation as I would feel very upset at the way I was being treated by my sister in this situation.", "YTA.

It sounds like there is a lot unsaid about how much help she is around the house. If the agreement is 2 nights a month, that\u2019s like $2-300 to pay a babysitter a month that you are saving. But that\u2019s a lot of money for a college student.  Why does the date night have to be every other Saturday? Does she do more than twice a month? Honestly I feel like you should be paying to babysit her on top of rent. Live in nannies often charge the same hourly rate as live out. Since you are making it about money, what is fair, etc\u2026 maybe after two years it\u2019s time for a change. Her time is valuable. If she genuinely wants to continue to live there, ask her what she thinks is reasonable and write something you both can live with. It sounds like she\u2019s doing this to save parents money. It sounds like the $500 is coming from parents. So keep that. But if you want to include childcare, you should pay her something or come up with like 8 hours of her time that you can mutually agree on she can babysit in the month. Anything over she is paid. And if she cancels, you reschedule but you plan ahead with her the hours. Maybe she doesn\u2019t make $25/hr if it\u2019s over the agreed like a normal babysitter, maybe $20.

Cleaning up after your roommates and their kids is absolutely not normal. OP said she did chores and did not specify that those chores were cleaning up after herself so I suspect that she\u2019s doing more than what would be normal in a roommate situation. And help with the kids implies doing far more than babysitting twice a month, otherwise I imagine she would have specified at that time that she only babysits them twice a month.

The sister is also completing chores for a much larger household than they would if they were in a dorm. Takes a minuet to vacuum a dorm room and wash dishes for 1 person.

There is no justification for making your sister pay a babysitter for *your* date nights. None, nada, zilch. You're already getting $500 in cash, and since I doubt the 2 Saturdays are the only time she takes care of *your* children, you're getting Goddess knows how much in *unpaid* labor just for that. Plus, it appears she is also working as your *unpaid* chef and *unpaid* maid. \n\nWhy don't we total all that unpaid labor up? If she does not live with you next year, you will not be getting that $500 a month. You will have to either <gasp> watch your own kids or pay a babysitter. You will have to cook your own damn meals, purchase more ready-made food, eat out, or order in. You'll have to clean your own house or pay someone to do it. \n\nSo let's see. That's $500 less in income per month. We use Merry Maids at about $150 every other week to clean about half of the house (2 seniors, no kids). Decent babysitter at $25/hour, just for the biweekly date nights? Let's say 6 hours each time. Plus whatever you'll have to pay for after school care, etc. Not even gonna try to estimate that. Eating out, ordering in, or purchasing fresh or frozen ready to cook meals is considerably more expensive than buying ingredients and having the luxury of *somebody else* doing the prep and cooking. \n\nSo, just the things I'm comfortable pricing out comes to $13,800 per year. That is for cleaning and date night babysitting, and the reduction in income. That doesn't include a penny for the other babysitting you will need or the hit your food budget is going to take. And with kids, I'm betting you will be paying more than $150 every other week for cleaning. Still think you'll be better off if she lives on campus? \n\nYou've been taking advantage of your sister for two years.

You talk to her with the same entitled and selfish energy you\u2019re using here (which I believe you do). \n\nShe is paying you a discounted rent.

Instead of have a $500 per month with chores and babysitting, the base should have been higher, say $700 per month but with $100 off for babysitting and certain dollar amounts for certain chores.

That means at least $300/month on food and it could easily be closer to the full $500. Add on heat, electricity, water, cable/internet.  Funny that no one mentions inflation or crazy high rents in this thread.\n\nI bet OP is probably pretty close to breaking even and she has another adult living in their house 24/7 (plus the sister\u2019s BF who sometimes spends the night).

But then she might get thrown at her face how much her parents shelled out for *her* education, *her* wedding, and all the extras she wanted at that stage in her life ...", "Or she\u2019s doing a lot of the chores, it doesn\u2019t say. she may clean up after kids that I\u2019m sure don\u2019t exactly have the skill set to do full chores.", "\ud83e\udd23no doubt.\n\" I offered to go get her something at the bodega\" mmmnn...chips and a gatorade", "And she/parents have to pay for it too! Literally the perfect scheme for scummy employers", "Not to mention a lot of state schools in the US REQUIRE it for the first year. Or they used to. So you got stuck paying the crazy high on campus rates. \n\nThe sister would be better off finding some room mates and living in off campus housing. Would have less responsibility and probably only a couple hundred more instead of 700 more per month. You couldn\u2019t subsidize my rent enough for me to watch someone\u2019s kids on Saturday nights in my early 20s", "You have to be pretty naive to think OP isn't taking advantage of her sister in childcare and chores. Also pretty sure sister is doing more babysitting during the week. Based off of OP post it says she helps with the kids and those two days are included.\n\nOP even admits they go for 5 hours or so those two dates. But from other comments it more says she does more hours when asked and needed or when they are late from work.\n\nI mean sister is a full time student and has to study. Then also take care of chores, cooks twice a week and babysit. Work her job.\n\nSounds like sister really doesn't have much time for a social life.\n\nIt isn't someone else job to pay for your kids to be watched.\n\nOP sounds like an AH and taking advantage of her sister.\n\nBased off another comment she now pissed off that her sister leaving taking away her babysitter.\n\nOn top of that we aren't sure how many kids she has, how old they are or if they have any health needs.\n\nBut you aren't even answering the question. OP is an AH for expecting her sister to pay for a babysitter to watch her kids. At the end of the day they are her kids not her sister and her sister shouldn't be shelling out money to pay for someone else kid.", "I bet she does all of it. I mean if you are living with them she can make you do stuff every single minute of the day if she wants. What are you gonna do? Storm out like a paid nanny would have? Nah you just end up doing everything.", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll as far as I did to finally find this comment.\n\nCompletely agree. I can\u2019t imagine charging my younger sister rent AND making her do chores/babysit. I treat my sister like my own child. I would never want her to feel like I\u2019m exploiting/taking advantage of her.", "She\u2019s definitely cleaning up after everyone else. That\u2019s why she said doing chores oppose to clean up after herself. Op is exploiting her sister and doesn\u2019t like that Sister is starting to wise-up and potentially pull away. Her live-in nanny may be smartening up.", "But technically correct is the best kind of correct! /s", "This is just abuse..I am shocked so many people are defending it.", "Then it makes sense for the sister to leave. Everybody wins.", ">it really can be taxing to share your space with someone else.\n\nRight. Now imagine sharing your space with an entire extra family, and paying $500/month to have a single room to yourself while you clean up after yourself + that whole family AND give free babysitting services twice a month. Talk about \"taxing\". I don't think it's all that \"taxing\" to have a live-in, free occasional nanny who also does chores and pays YOU for the \"opportunity\" to do so.", "Yeah...OP's comments are basically \"well, she shouldn't have signed the contract then lol.\" \n\nIt sounds like the sister has school and a job, which means she's just as busy at OP, so...why not be more flexible? I don't think she understands that even full-time nannies tend to have *some* flexibility for days off. And babysitters can just say they aren't available. \n\nMy uncle used to do this sort of thing where he kept score. He quit when we started doing the same to him. I'm willing to bet OP has a realizing once the sister moves out that sister was in fact doing a lot around the house.", "I'm sure if Sis rented from an unrelated landlord, that landlord would be profiting more than Evil OP is /s.\n\nJust because OP has a house (co-owned by the bank), doesn't mean that Sis is entitled to free or even at-cost-of utilities, unprofitable-to-OP housing.", "Sister is an adult woman. Why is OP obligated to pay for her sister? She\u2019s not. \u201cProfit\u201d in this day and age from $500 per month which includes food is incorrect. You take some people into your house for $500/month and also provide them food and see how much \u201cprofit\u201d you make off that.", "Big difference between every single Saturday and every other Saturday. \n\nMost college students start the weekend on Thursdays and party 3 nights a week. Those 2 nights a month are the only ones that OP and her husband ever get to go out.\n\nIf every other Saturday is so important to OP\u2019s sister then she can get a job so she can afford a different place.", "That's what I was wondering, how much babysitting total are we talking about?", "Where I live $500 would be fair for food and utilities for a month.", "This was my thought. Honestly it feels to me like OP is being exploited by the parents and is exploiting the sister in return. OP should be getting a better deal from the parents.", "She isn't providing food and utilities... her RENT pays for that...", "Sorry, I'm still going to doubt this. OP's sister is using ONE room as her own, and OP states she'd use it for something else if her sister wasn't there, so the lights in that room would be on anyway. Internet doesn't cost more just because a third person is using it. OP or her husband will cook dinner anyway so that accounts for gas or electric stove use. That only leaves water and some additional food. I cannot see *any* way in which they would need an additional $500 a month to pay for 1 or 2 more showers a day plus one more serving per meal per day.", "Yeah a hobby room she said in her post.  I am not even certain what kind of bedding is in there, an air mattress?  What' her sister's rent/mortgage?  Somehow I don't think she could rent this out on the market for that.\n\nIt's a weird flex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStudent loans sound better than this.", "The sister might be better off in the dorm. That would be a perfectly valid choice. However while she is staying with OP she needs to abide by the deal they made.", "You mentioned it\u2019s about how much OP\u2019s room is worth at fair market value. In this case, it\u2019s not.\n\nWhy? Because if OP\u2019s sister didn\u2019t live here, OP wouldn\u2019t be renting out that room at all. OP would be using it for her hobbies. So, there is the abstract loss of value that OP has less space for her own life and interests in her own home. Fair market value is not relevant here because OP is not renting her home out on the fair market. Her family asked her for a favor, she has agreed to help and they agreed on terms. Now they want to break the terms but still receive the help without fulfilling their end. \n\nIf OP\u2019s 500/mo rent were ABOVE fair market value, then don\u2019t you think OP\u2019s sister would just find another place that wasn\u2019t? The fact that sister\u2019s complaining that her only options are OP\u2019s place and campus implies that there ARE no better options. Or she hasn\u2019t even looked, who knows.\n\nYou also say \u201cShe sounds like she just wanted a live in maid and babysitter, not that she wanted to help out her sister\u201d - I think a more likely possibility is that in order for OP to feel comfortable opening her home for YEARS as an ongoing arrangement, she expected her sis to pick up after herself, help keep common areas clean, and help out for ~12 hrs a month (let\u2019s say date night is 5-11PM). \n\nAnd yeah, maybe OP didn\u2019t want to help her sister, but she did it anyway. That help came with terms. That\u2019s perfectly valid. Do you help everyone who asks you to do anything even if you don\u2019t want to or are physically/mentally unable to? If so you may want to read up on porous boundaries. :)\n\nNot to mention, OP\u2019s husband is losing some of his privacy and personal space having his sister-in-law living with them.\n\nOP - NTA because no one is entitled to your space. You agreed on an exchange and they want to re-negotiate, but you have a right to say no. I\u2019d guess this is one of many examples of lack of boundaries and emotional enmeshment within your family. You\u2019ll probably want to pick your battles wisely. Good luck!", "I wouldn't write off the cooking. Let's say it's 2 kids. Then sister is cooking 10 dinner servings/week and receiving 7 dinner servings/week. It's also more work than cook a whole meal for 5 vs. 1.\n\nOp also mentions laundry duty is shared too. I wonder if it's a similar breakdown. Where sister is doing slightly more then her share.\n\nAll these slightly more add up.", "What a prince \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah, reading threads like this often baffles me as an Asian. It's not just immediate family, but so many extended family members lived with us throughout my childhood. They pulled their weight and helped around the house, bought groceries every once in a while, etc. Charging them was out of the question. We have great relationships with them, and even with both parents gone now, we always know we have people looking out for us. I used to dream of growing up in developed countries like the US, but the more I learn about their family dynamics, I'm glad I grew up where I did. It just sounds so lonely and isolating.", "Sounds like she did and left. Which means she was being exploited, but went along with it till it got too much to bare. \n\nWhy would you treat your sister as a walking talking paying childcare and cleaner?", "My dad charged me rent when I stayed in his house during college. And when I graduated and moved out he gave me all the money, which he had invested, and the profits off the investment. It made things a lot easier starting a career."]}
