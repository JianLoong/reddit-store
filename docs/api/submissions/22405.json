Break the deal and face the wheel.", "INFO it\u2019s not clear if you agreed to a schedule for babysitting that you refused to adjust, thereby forcing her to comply or pay more money or you expected her to be on call for babysitting and it just so happens that one of those times is you wanting Saturday every other week.", "NTA.

She is saving a ton of money and it\u2019s two Saturday evenings a month. The key part of this is that it was agreed upon beforehand. This is not something that you sprung on her once she moved in, or started creeping in like so many other babysitting stories. This was a formal agreement and worked well for two years. If it\u2019s not working for your sister anymore, then she needs to discuss with you and renegotiate.\n\nYour parents need to either talk to her about honoring the terms of the agreement, or deal with the room and board fees.

If this were a formal arrangement, like the school dorm option, it would be on a one-year basis and the terms would be revisited annually. That's because things change: housing supply and demand, inflation, etc. It is simply time for OP and sister to renegotiate terms for the next 12-month period (in a calm, adult, non-punitive fashion) and plan to revisit every 12 months thereafter. \n\nAnd as for parents, theoretically, they should only be involved with sister, not OP. Any education funding negotiations should be between parents and sister, leaving OP out of it. Theoretically.", "ESH\n\nSure you had prior agreement on what her responsibilitites are but could you not compromise on the date or duration? Like make it a Sunday if she wants to go out on Saturday? If you had compromised and offered flexibility and she still complains, then you're NTA.\n\nShe sucks because it's only every other week and if she was working to pay for her own life, she would need to give up even more time to make up for the cheap boarding option. And she was the one who said \"I'll just move to dorm\" when she isn't going to pay for it (as mom said her costs increase?).\n\nMom called you a bitch? Lmao if she wants the younger kid to keep cheap room, then why not offer to give her more spending money, which could then cover your babysitter so all sides get what they want? But instead she called her older daughter a bitch for wanting to hold the sister to a fair agreement.", "You do not calculate the cost of a room on your house based on what she\u2019d pay at university .. that\u2019s number one. You calculate based on what you could get from a stranger. She is absolutely not responsible for paying for your sitter. Calculate what you\u2019d get for renting the room\u2026 subtract the fact that you would never rent to a stranger because you have kids.. slight discount for her  bonus for you because you have help.  calculate what you\u2019d pay a sitter .. etc. that\u2019s how it works .. she doesn\u2019t pay for your sitter\u2026 her babysitting comes off what her rent is. She\u2019s also only responsible for cleaning up after herself not you and spouse and children.. that\u2019s extra. Where I live a student can get a studio w utilities for 500 a month so working two days a month \u2026 at 20 an hour plus.. it\u2019s actually more expensive to live with you so it depends on cost of living and what sitters charge. Where I am you can get a crappy sitter that\u2019s not reliable or trustworthy for 15-17 an hour .. in high cost cities it\u2019s over 20..", "NTA \n\nYou offered for her to pay for the babysitter, I would\u2019ve just told her to leave. Just because life circumstances change ( her getting a bf) doesn\u2019t mean her responsibilities and the agreements she made disappear.", "NTA \nYou're essentially hiring your sister as a nanny including subsidized living without pay. she can quit this job as your nanny and live by herself. Only thing is, your family doesn't sacrifice much for each other - which is your own family dynamic and may make people feel like you're the asshole.", "But she only pays you $500 including the water and the electricity etc ...", "If the deal that you have in writing specifically states that she will babysit every other saturday (or for X hours a week)... then your sister is in the wrong here. Part of her \"room and board\" is babysitting.  Send your mother a copy of the agreement and ask her to point out exactly how you are abusing the terms of your agreement.

I went to school a billion years ago, but this seems similar to saying that you didn\u2019t want to go to your work-study tutoring job on Saturdays but that you should still be paid.", "Again the sister only pays $500 dollars a MONTH INCLUDING THE WATER , ELECTRICITY AND FOOD", "Why does she have to compromise? They have written agreement? OP has held up her end.", "Agree. OP got a stay-in cleaner and sitter while being paid $500 a month\u2026 My mom paid for that when I was young. As I see it, OP had the real deal here. \n\nI don\u2019t know about your relationship, but if it was my sister she would not be paying rent, only for food, electricity and such I would take some money that could be refunded by doing extra chores or watching kids. Your deal seems kinda exploiting.", "and? what\u2019s your point?", "Because\n\n1) they are ultimately siblings, not employer relationship\n\n2) the agreement has been going on for over two years. Things change, people's schedules change. If you work a part time job it is common to have to change availability and negotiate hours.\n\n3) it's a decent and reasonable thing to do regardless of who it is"]}
