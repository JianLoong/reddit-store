I simply make sure to come in early for a good spot\n\nWe stopped about midway through the trip at a gas station and we all had to get off. Had to. No biggie, just make sure to come back quickly for my spot. Somebody had taken it so I take the one right behind it, I guess no need to respect previous spots. No problem \n\nSuddenly guy behind me tells me (very respectfully) those are his parents seats and they have to be together. I tell him I get it but someone took my spot so..Meanwhile the buss is obviously filling back up quickly. The guy's parents arrive and in a much more confrontational way start telling me that's their spot. I tell them the same thing someone took my spot so what am I supposed to do\n\nGirl that took my spot asks if I would mind change seats, I ask where is hers and says all the way in the back. I told her I did mind doing that. She gets upset saying she understands the couple wants to be together but I'm alone and she wants to be with her friend. I don't feel (nor did I) I have to explain myself to strangers but I can't do back of buses, much less window seats. I asked her if it was at least an aisle seat and she just said whatever and went to her previous seat\n\n It was an uncomfortable ride the rest of the way, at least in my head. More reason as to why I stay away from others especially those I don't know. I'm minding my whole business the whole day don't speak to a single person have my headphones on 90% of the time yet I find myself being yelled at by a couple and thought of as inconsiderate by someone else and probably those around us.

You don't swap out seats during a stop unless you are in high school on a trip to the museum.
