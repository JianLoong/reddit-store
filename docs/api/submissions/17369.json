{"id": 17369, "submission_id": "13j0kix", "title": "AITA for telling my wife I don't want to attend a church service for our late son", "selftext": "I (34m) have been married for 10 years. My wife and I had four children, four boys. Our oldest died almost 3 years ago from cancer. It was during his fight with cancer that I started to accept that I am an atheist. I was born into a Catholic family, raised to be Catholic and tried to be for many years despite doubts and many questions I had. My first \"test of faith\" or whatever you want to call it came when my sister came out and was shunned by everyone we knew, including our parents. But it was when she died at 17 and the priest and some of my parents friends told them it was God's way of saving us from her sin, that I really saw myself not fitting with religion, of any kind really since I had friends of different faiths who talked about their parents not agreeing with my sister's \"choices\" (meaning being gay).\n\nMy wife is Catholic and when we started dating she was aware I doubted and questioned a lot about faith and whether I believed. When Jonah was born my heart was so full. He was the person who made me a father and he taught me so much through his sickness.\n\nWhen he died my wife leaned more into religion, even more than she had when he was sick. But I did not believe. I actually hated some of the things that were said around this time. About a month after Jonah died my wife brought up that I did not pray anymore, did not join her in prayer or in church and I told her why. She asked how I could turn away from God and I told her I did not believe there was a God out there. Our marriage struggled and we went to counseling, which helped, but I am starting to feel like our marriage became incompatible when I gave up pretending to be religious or a believer of any kind.\n\nMy wife's church has a special service planned for Jonah, a service her parents had a big part in organizing. Only I have not been to church at all in more than a year.\n\nI have reached the point where I can't go anymore. The last time I saw the local priest he wanted to talk to me about God, faith and the bible and how healing it can be. He brought up my sister during that talk and Jonah and how I should rest knowing my son was safe from my sister's sin and how they were being kept apart. It made me furious.\n\nWith this service for our son, my wife told me she wanted me there and I told her I could not go. She asked why and I told her I could not go because I do not believe. She brought up that I used to believe and I told her I tried to believe but I was fooling myself. And that it turns my stomach to hear the things talked about in church and only serves to make me angry, especially coming from that priest. She told me this is for our son and he died a Catholic and I should be willing to do anything for him or for the rest of our boys, who she says are all starting to talk more like me. She told me as her husband I should be there to support her if nothing else. She saw I didn't want to and she told me I was failing my family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684230507, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j0kix/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_dont_want_to_attend_a/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA\n\nI think it is possible to go to a church and just enjoy the sense of peace and the possibility of there being more to our life than we can see without being religious but you are not at that stage. The priest has ruined that for you.", "NTA. Your grief is yours, and you can grieve in any way that helps your healing. The issue of judgement towards your sister seems central here, if the church provided a safe space for you to grieve, whether you believe or not, then I'd say go. But if they're going to say hurtful and cruel things that undermines your process and there's no good reason for you to put yourself through that. If you haven't spoken to your wife about those comments maybe you should, if she thinks the reason is a simple \"I'm not religious\" with no nuance about why, then I can also see her perspective and why she might feel abandoned during her grieving process. I'm sorry for your loss OP, hope you and your wife figure out a way to navigate this.", "She has a right to her ideas. You have the right to mourn your own way. The service isn't for your child but rather for those alive as a way to grieve. She can attend it, everyone that needs this should be there but your feelings and ideas must be respected. This is why I abhor religion. Too effen evil.\n\nI'm terribly sorry that you've lost your baby, I cannot imagine how devastating this was. May his memories fill your heart with joy and surround you with the warmth of the love you shared \u2764\ufe0f \n\ndefinitely NTA", "Nta. You are not obligated to harm yourself for anyone. What those people said to you was harmful. I'm so sorry for your loss. Take care of yourself.", "NTA.  If it was just about your son, then you should go.  Their fairy tales won't hurt you.  But if they insist on talking smack about your sister, you should not have to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nI simply cannot imagine the scale of the pain and the grief you and your wife must have endured and continue to endure. \n\nCongratulations on staying alive. That is a genuine accomplishment. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should go, considering your completely valid feelings. \n\nHowever I do think you should find a way to \u2018turn back towards\u2019 your wife, if that makes sense?\n\nYou\u2019d no doubt be aware of the massive increase in the incidence of divorce post the loss of a child. \n\nThis seems like it could represent a significant wedge between you.  \n\nDon\u2019t go, but find a way to make sure it isn\u2019t the beginning of the end of your marriage.", "NTA. The same way your wife is entitled to her beliefs are religion, you are entitled to your own belief system and she should not be forcing you into attending a service for a religion that no longer serves you.  Added to this, the manner in which they treated your sister alive and when she dies was disgusting. I am Catholic too and was treated badly when I divorced and wanted to re-marry.  They would not marry my husband and I because I had been divorced.  There is a difference between religion and spirituality.\n\nYour wife needs to give you space to find where you are in the world and if you believe in anything and if not, accept that and you.", "NTA and the E S H comments are missing the point. Memorial services like this are for the living, not the dead. The dead can't hear them. If you can't stomach attending a church that harmed your sister and has been uncaring towards you (with their dismissal of your doubts), then by all means, do not go. \n\nYou do not owe faith to anyone, not even your wife. Not having faith does not make you a lesser person, husband, or father.", "NTA.\n\nyour grieving in your own way, your wife should put religion aside for this and let you grieve.", "The only AH here is the priest that said that about your late sister. I'm sorry for your loss OP, as a parent I can't imagine your grief. Hopefully you and your wife can reconcile the fact that you both have different coping mechanisms and respect each others choices. NTA.", "NTA first I am so sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine a bigger pain than loose a child.\nGrief and religion are extremely personal, and while yes it\u2019s important to be there for your partner for mutual support, if this priest is so awful to you don\u2019t go. If at the grief you have to add the moral lesson, no thank you.\nThat said, maybe your wife should find another church. I am atheist myself but my dear fiend is Catholic and was recently at her daughter first communion. Both her godparents (I don\u2019t know if this is the correct term) are homosexuals and religious. A more open minded priest I think it\u2019s a must for couples that don not share same religious views.", "NTA \n\nI get this is for your dead son, but she should also understand that you're still alive and that you lost any belief in that religion. No one should be forced to attend a religious rite he doesn't support.", "fuck, I am so sorry man. NTA. This service is in no way for your son. These types of thing are for the living. If you can tune out the bullshit, be there for your wife. I won't call her the AH here, because she is hurting and grasping for any comfort she can find, but at another time the comment about the boys talking more like you should be met with pride, it means they are learning to have open minds and not be sucked into the hate that the church teaches as normal. Religion requires a disconnect of analytical thought, the reality is you can't be a \"good catholic\" by being a good catholic. \n\nIf you really can't stomach the hate, don't. You won't do any of you any good. I hope that you can salvage your marriage. While the churches stance on quite a few issues is abhorrent, that odd little disconnect does allow good people to have \"faith\" I don't understand it, but it is a thing. Your wife's faith does not make her a bad person, but it may make it impossible for you to live together. You'll have to get through this and see. Good luck, go keep being the best role model you can to the kids that still need you.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your losses. Being an atheist (as I am) wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop me from going to a church service if my presence would be helpful to my loved ones. But the proselytizing and the disgusting disparagement of your sister in the guise of comforting you about your son? I totally understand why you don\u2019t want any part of that toxic organization. Obviously NTA, you are not failing your family, and I hope you find some peace.", "NTA. I am an atheist as well and I strongly believe that nobody can be forced to be in a church and attend a sercive. That should be enough reason. But the fact that how those people were talking about your sister shows how narrow minded  and hateful they are. I wouldn't want to be around them either... You don't disrespect your son by not going. You would disrespect the Catholic religion if you pretended to believe when you don't. I myself attend weddings at churches but only out of curiosity. I went against the will of my boyfriend's whole family (My boyfriend isn't religious either. He wouldnt' mind a church wedding but knowing how I don't want one he is totally fine with not having one.) and declared our wedding won't include a church wedding and our children won't be baptised.\n\nIt's only on you. Don't let anybody guilt trip you. I'm pretty sure you grieve in your own way.", "Damn I would have punched that priest in the face", "NTA but you said the wrong thing, you didn't go because you didn't believe - you didn't go because you had a relative stranger bringing up very personal and emotional past of yours out of the blue and uses it to try and get you to \"turn back to god\" - repeatedly. \n\nIt is also uncomfortable I would imagine to know the church goers know such personal things about you when you are not willing or a member of the congregation. \n\nIf you did want to go back to Christianity I would suggest you find a new church that echoes more of what you find valuable about belief in God.\n\nIt must be tough to be in a marriage where such different beliefs are held", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, I\u2019m so sorry to hear about the loss of your son.\n\nYour wife shouldn\u2019t be forcing her beliefs onto you regardless of whether or not you were raised Catholic yourself. You have expressed on multiple occasions that you do not believe and consider yourself to be an atheist, this is something that your wife should respect, even if she does not agree with your choices.\n\nIt\u2019s completely fair for you to say you don\u2019t want to be at the church, this is your opinion and it should be respected, it\u2019s also understandable why you wouldn\u2019t want to be near the priest in any situation, let alone this one. To bring up your sister in relation to your son in this way is completely unnecessary and I imagine quite damaging for yourself.\n\nHowever, as this is a special service for your son, I believe it would be the best thing for you to go. It will help you grieve and honour your son, but it will also show your wife that you respect her faith even if you do not believe in it yourself, and that you are there to support each other through this tough time.\n\nRegarding your other children - \u201cshe says are all starting to talk more like me\u201d - they are allowed to have their own opinions on faith too, just like yourself. If they want to be Catholic then they can, if they don\u2019t want to be, then they shouldn\u2019t be forced. Despite this, I think you attending the service will be a good way to show your children that even if you do not believe in any faith, it is important to respect other people\u2019s beliefs too.", "I am a Christian and I do not recognise anything the priest says. \n\nGod is out there killing gay people to save the rest of us now??? God\u2019s worked out a segregated system to keep kids and gays apart up there. \n\nThis is like no kind of God I\u2019d be interested in and I would not go to that church either.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't a simple matter of you just \"not believing.\" You've experienced religious trauma. It causes you genuine emotional distress to be in church or at religious services because of that trauma.\n\nYour wife should be supporting you in this. Maybe give her some reading materials on religious trauma so she understands better what it is that you're experiencing. I'm sure there are ways you can support her, as well, that don't involve you being in a situation which is genuinely triggering for you.\n\nPlease also keep in mind that the two of you and your children are working through a profound grief, and nobody is rational in those periods. Be gentle to yourselves and to each other. \n\nMy deepest condolences on the loss of your son.", "NTA for not believing in God, if he's there then why would he let things like this happen. Having said that going so you can support your wife might be a good idea, so long as she understands you're \u013al\u013a\u2070there for her and her only.\nI hope your wife can understand how you feel", "NAH.\n\nFirstly, very sorry for your loss. I know it's been three years already but it's a major loss that you never really get over, but I hope you find peace one day.\n\nNAH because you're entitled to your beliefs and this shouldn't be forced. And that priest was way out of line (albeit not unexpected for a Catholic priest -talking from my own experience here, being raised Catholic myself). \n\nHowever. Your wife does have a point that it shouldn't necessarily be for you, but in support of her and your kids too. If she needs you there, you should be there. And I understand if it's difficult.\n\nThis isn't a situation where anyone is right or wrong, but it is a situation where someone needs to look at the bigger picture/ make the compromise.", "There's a divorce in your future, mate. Start planning. \n\nThey are sick and evil, to begin with, talking about your dead sister that way. **SICK AND EVIL**  I tell you. \n\nWho in the right mind would say something like that?\n\nYour wife, to a sane non-believer, is suffering from delusions about sins, heaven, hell, all that jazz. She is not going to get better. You need a divorce and 50/50 custody and raise your kids with the benefit of **doubting one's beliefs** like an atheist does. \n\nThey can do Catholicism if they want to, but they will have your home that is a haven of rational thinking and **actual love.** \n\nThey will tell your kids (already have) that your sister was evil.

They should respect that. Don't they believe in freedom of religion?", "NTA. \n\nThat said, i think you should go to support your wife.

Remind him next time that Jesus died so sins were forgiven so maybe he should be taking that example. \n\nYour son died a catholic and is safe, by his and your wife's beliefs, in the arms of the Lord.

Honestly if I were you my kids wouldn't be anywhere near that priest and I'd tell my wife that if she wanted the kids to go to Church it would have to be at a different one. I'd also file complaints with the Bishop and even higher about him as he is going way too far for what even the Church teaches and accepts now. I also stopped going a long time ago because a Priest told me it was a sin and I'd burn in hell for leaving my ex who almost killed me and threatened to finish the job. Some people shouldn't be Priests and unfortunately your family is around one of them. Please protect your other kids from hearing those things about their aunt. And if your wife agrees to switch then consider meeting her partway and going solely as a support for her while not participating in the sacraments and other rituals. I'm so incredibly sorry for the loss of your son. I have leukemia and cancer is something I think most of us wish we could take instead of the children.

But, yes, sometimes family gets weirdly demanding about how much I participate in rituals which are insulting to me.  They don't seem to get - and here's a phrase that might be helpful to you - t*hat it's as harmful to you when they try to force you to participate, than it would be to them if you tried to force them not to participate.*\n\nThat convinces some.\n\nBut if that doesn't work - be aware, I'm told by a pediatrician friend, that when a child dies, it's frequent that the parents' marriage fails, because one wants to forget it, and the other wants to center their lives around the child.   It sounds like you are headed well down this pathway.\n\nBecause of that, you may wish to consider just how much of the Catholic ritual you can actually stomach.  Most - not all - is about sitting silently.  If you, as the bereaved father, simply sat there and asked to be left alone, I would imagine that in the moment, in the Church, no one is going to yell at you to get up and start singing, take communion.\n\nI know, I know, listening to the wrong-headed things the priest says is awful; but remember, just because you hear another person say something, doesn't mean you believe it, doesn't mean you accept it, and doesn't mean you even need to respond.\n\nI am so, so sorry for your and your family's loss, and grief.", "NTA and that is very religious priest, not very christian.", "If that priest is doing the service I\u2019d have a very hard time going, even to support my partner. This could become a growing rift between you and your spouse, however. If you don\u2019t go, be clear on why. As a nonbeliever, I go to weddings and funerals as support to the believers.", "NTA. Whether intentional or not she's using your son's death to manipulate your religious views. You're both grieving and it's not fair of her to ask you to support her in a way that seems like it would be deeply hurtful to you. And it does not sound like she has accepted your lack of faith, she seems to think you'll come back to the church. \n\nYou say you went to counseling, you should probably still be in counseling.", "OP. Don\u2019t listen to Reddit. You\u2019d be better off talking to a counsellor. \n\nWhat choice you make here could have forever implications for your marriage. You are deciding whether your hatred/disdain/dislike/apathy/whatever for you wife\u2019s church is more of less important than providing that support to your wife that she has requested. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the right decision is - but do know that that is not a simple decision - and how your marriage functions will depend on the decisions both of you make here. \n\nThe death of a child can so easily break marriages - reddit really isn\u2019t the place to go for advice or support (or definitely not AITA). Many would agree with your views of the church (and extend that hatred to your wife as a devout Catholic) - and will happily tell you to divorce her over this. In 5 years time the decision you make today could still be playing out in your life - and in 5 minutes most of the people who comment won\u2019t even care any more.", "There is no hate like christan love. Raised catholic, deacons in my family. But even at a young age, the whole pray for whatever thing.... Like if when my dad died of cancer when I was a kid.... It was someone's fault because we didn't pray hard enough, or believe enough or tythe enough? That he a was paying for an unknown sin? Like nuking my family was part of a greater plan? F that noise. The purpose of any organized religion is to control people and subjugate women. You can have faith in the unseen universe with out adhering to a particular dogma. \nMy family accepts my view point, though I'm LC with some.\nTell your wife that her god gave her the gift of free will. She can use it to choose to be judgemental or to choose love and acceptance. When she has her answer, to let you know. Threat way you both can move forward together or on separate paths.\nNTA OP, and your post shows that you clearly both love and honor your sister and son. I wish you peace and happiness.", "INFO: is this a mass in his name or a funeral? \n\nI was raised Catholic too and have been agnostic since my late teens. My father was still a serious and practicing Catholic up until his death and he had both a funeral and a handful of masses dedicated to him. \n\nCatholic funerals are barely about the deceased at all. I honestly don't understand how they are at all helpful to the grieving family. At my father's funeral, the priest said almost nothing about him (and when listing children completely missed mentioning me, but that's a different story). It was the worst Catholic funeral I've been to, but they all are fairly impersonal. \n\nThat said, I went because it was important to dad even though I personally hated every second of it. If this is a funeral, I think it would be kind to attend to be supportive of the way your wife is grieving, even though it isn't helpful to you. You don't have to talk to anyone or justify yourself to anyone, just sit in solidarity. If it's not a funeral and is instead a dedicated mass, I wouldn't go. I don't think I would call anyone here an A H either way. \n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss of your son.", "Is it not a memorial? I think his kid died 3 years ago if I read it correctly.", "Not to mention that his son was maybe 6? Being baptised is one thing, but unless the son went through the next 2 sacraments.... A baptism isn't exactly something the son could make a decision about. I've done all 3 of them and still don't exactly believe, but it keeps the peace with my religious grandfather.", "I think it's even more than that priest but he definitely brought along feelings that I've had most of my life.", "My wife is aware of what happened. She said the priest can be wrong about some things but right about others because he is human like the rest of us. She cannot understand my not getting comfort or healing from all of the religion stuff. She does and I am happy she has that. It was never really for me.", "Also I am so sorry for the loss of your boy.", "The fact that the Priest is actively harming his own grieving process by digging up past trauma moves this clear way from NAH territory for me. The wife is the AH for not sympathizing with the Husband and condoning the priests actions. She could have moved churches, had the service at another church or done anything to validate her husband's feelings. It makes me sick to hear and I'm not even married to OP", "What an awful take", "There are people who have religious trauma, including my husband. He couldn't go to my aunt's funeral. I recriminated him after the fact. And now I realise I was the AH, thanks to OP.", "Why should he compromise or stomach it? His parents and priest were glad his sister died because she was gay. OP and his kids are better off staying from religious fanatics.", "I don't know if he actually believed or not. My wife and our families wanted him to, they told him to, but he didn't exactly talk about it or express that he was. So he was baptized and all as Catholic but for all any of us knows he didn't believe, wasn't sure or had mixed feelings.", "> Do it for your son, man\n\nIt's three years later; his son is sadly long gone.", "I find it weird how people can say 'words can soothe someone but can't hurt them'. Yes, words can hurt, and OP has already had more than enough of it from the church. If he can't stomach going, then that's a boundary his wife shouldn't force.", "They wanted to hold one every anniversary but Covid was a big factor in that not happening.", "I don't know where op lives, but where I live, we celebrate the death of a special one with a mess every once a year. So that the priest especially remembers that specific person. It doesn't have to be on Sunday... I'm not sure if this is what op is talking about, tho.", "Is that designed to help or hinder their relationship? I mean sure - if your objective is to make sure that your marriage does not survive this loss then that\u2019s absolutely the way to go.\n\nBut if you maybe hope to continue as a family together despite this loss - then that\u2019s a rant you are better having with a fellow atheist friend or a neutral counsellor. Not your children. Not your wife.", "Reading this, it's definitely the priest. I'm agnostic with Catholic in laws (in a deeply catholic country), but I could never ever imagine their priest saying any of these things about your sister or your son. \n\nPriesthood does attract sociopaths though because it is another job that gives you leadership over many people.", "Yes, how your life has gone has taken you away from the path of being a believer, but you would have been able to attend this ceremony to support your wife and maybe found your own peace, it seems to me, if not for this insidious homophobia from the priest.", "That's the same excuse they used to justify everything that happened with all those priests and the kids they hurt. \n\nYou should not even be asked to deal with that priest or be involved in this. I can't support you attending this for your wife because it's a show. You don't really believe it.", "Maybe then your wife should be doing some damage control to support you too. I think it's a big cop out to listen to a priest as an authority figure but then excuse hurtful comments with \"he's also human\", and I say this as someone who chose to become Catholic. Is it possible to just attend the service with your wife and dodge any conversations? It seems like it's important to her.", "Normally, I would have said YTA because even church funerals and memorials are not just about religion.   \n\n\nThat priest sounds like a right dick though. Would moving church be an option for your wife?", "If he really wasn't a believer or had doubts then by all means. Don't go. My issue was it was for your son whom I believed was a believer. If you had doubts he was... Then it makes no sense no compromising", "Because of you have no belief in something, it cant hurt you, but if you do believe it, you give those words meaning. Look\u2026 when my mum died, my dad had a humanist funeral for her, no mention of god or anything at all, because he completely turned away from faith when she died, whereas I, decided I wanted to start going to church, (i mean, im over it now, back to atheism) but my Dad who swore he would never set foot in a church again, came with me, for me, because its what people who love you do, and although we dont do that anymore, its something we did together that improved our relationship, and I appreciated my dad taking me there so I could find comfort, even though he didnt.", "My thoughts exactly. I come from a religious family, and even though I don\u2019t believe myself, I\u2019ve been able to attend at some ceremonies and services just looking at people gathering, looking at the lights and the beautiful artifacts and architecture. But that priest! Who and what does he think he is? How stupid is it possible to be?", "Your Y T A counts as a vote, just fyi. Not sure if you intended that. Also, NTA"]}
