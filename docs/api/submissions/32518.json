He is easily agitated when things don\u2019t go his way and has a hard time accepting deviations from his expectations or plans. \n\nIn his words, I am clumsy and absent. Which is true to an extent, but I try my best not to make the same mistakes. However doesn\u2019t matter how hard I try, I still do. My strength lies somewhere else, I grew up not required to do housework, spent majority of time studying that\u2019s why I have better income and more financially organised. I learned to do housework, cooking and general practical things in my adulthood. \n\nThe problem is that he wants me to apologise for every mistake I\u2019ve made. His face and voice would completely change, looks at me like I\u2019m his child, say things like \u201cI don\u2019t need your explanation and excuses. What are you supposed to say? You\u2019re sorry\u201d. Instances of mistakes include, burning a stainless steel pan that we just bought (food stuck on it with some discolouration which later on all came off), forget to put the shower head back to its place after shower (because it can cause damage to the shower head in the long run), didn\u2019t plan a trip properly. The worst of all, he would call me \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cuseless\u201d, \u201cfailure\u201d, \u201cwhat a child\u201d, \u201cspoiled princess\u201d and more insulting languages. \n\nI apologised in the earlier times but it seemed to only justify his attitude to \u201ceducate\u201d me. Even tho I felt apologetic for my doing, after being talked down by him and seeing his face change, I just don\u2019t want to apologise anymore. So I started to refuse. I am making an effort with visible improvement. I am now doing most of the housework and cooking and has been more aware of details. Sometimes it takes time to learn and maybe after 3-5 times of repeating the same mistakes, I truly learn. He gets really upset if I don\u2019t apologise, but I get really anxious and guilty when his face changes. I just wish that he\u2019s more tolerant seeing that I\u2019m working on myself. He claims that not apologising is the reason why he calls me these insulting things (which he thinks are just truth). \n\nI told him I\u2019m considering a divorce because I can\u2019t handle his abusive language. Despite he\u2019s been a supportive and caring husband all these years. He moved country for me and took care of me physically all the time. He is a kind person, but he just has his baggage from childhood that he needs to realize and resolve on his own. Unfortunately he\u2019s not curious and inquisitive enough to look into that. \n\nOf course I know there\u2019s no excuse for his verbal abuse, but Is this norma/justifiedl for wanting an apology for every mistakes?", "created_utc": 1701944790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cspvp/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_for_every_little/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

SMH\n\nEDIT: isn't there a movie with this theme?

His only \"baggage\" is that, at some point in his life, he got the idea that verbally abusing women is okay. I'm glad you were able to recognise it. It takes a strong person to stand up against an abuser, and resist their manipulation. \n\nYou say that this post is just about apologies - but it isn't. You are asking us whether he'd be right if we disregard the verbal abuse - why? Ultimately, I think you should ask yourself why the whole \"are apologies required\" issue is important to you at all. It's absolutely irrelevant, and the only person who wants you to care about it is your husband, because it will distract you from the real problem - his utter disrespect to you.\n\nBut, to answer your question... while a quick \"oops!\" or \"sorry!\" is what most people say after being clumsy, demanding a full-on apology would be insane. Yes, if someone accidentally stepped on my foot and didn't react *at all*, I'd be put off - to me, it would seem like the person doesn't care. But if he is asking you to properly apologise every single time, and insults you if you don't, he is trying to instill feelings of guilt or inadequacy into you.\n\nIt was never about apologising.

There is a huge difference between the two.  ==  I have walked in on \"burning\" stainless steel pans.  In one case, a grease fire had broken out because my ex had left the (gas) fire on high and walked away to take a bath.

People like him will always need to seek out people who don\u2019t have enough experience in life to know better.", "But he\u2019s deaf and blind to your need and right not to be belittled, hounded, and abused. You deserve more than this in life, OP.", "Name calling is never ok. Ever. But to be fair, OP has made quite a few edits to her post after people started asking questions who were quite legitimate from her original post.", "Being concerned about the pan would be normal if it was a good stainless steel pan. I have one myself and I would be very disappointed if someone broke it. That doesn't mean he get to call you names tho.", "OP stated that she burned the pan; that's very different than burning some food.  I've dealt with a burning stainless pan -- it was, quite literally, burning and a fire hazard.", "Not knowing what it means to put a shower head back in its place, I focused on what I understood: a burned pan.  There are a few ways of doing so; and all of them are fire hazard.  BTW: burning a pan (which is what OP originally posted) is quite different than burning some food in it.", "Have you ever seen a pan burning?  It's the oil that is aflame.  And it is a fire hazard.", "The pan I could see as an actual mistake. The other examples are utter nonsense. Please explain to me how not putting the shower head back into the position he likes is damaging it? Does he put it back where you like it when he\u2019s done? Even if you were making actual mistakes, his reaction is abusive and he shows no inclination to change. You should follow through with leaving.", "What kind of burning are we talking about? Just some food sticking to it from cooking, or did you straight up stain and or warp it from the heat? If it's stains from food it's totally normal and your husband shouldn't say a word because that's what doing the dishes is for. If I'm the other hand you broke something it would be common to assume an apology.", "> I was already scared that he will get angry\n\nThis feeling alone is a Big Neon Sign that you are in abusive relationship. Loving partners should NEVER be afraid one of each other.", "The pan clearly wasn't fixable or he would not have noticed, and it's not really that common, not if people pay attention to what they are doing. And him having to keep reminding you about things is just a sign that you don't care, which on turn can lead to his outbursts.  But ultimately I think you should break up because you clearly aren't compatible. I personally couldn't live with someone as clumsy as you admitted you are.", "I was responding to the OP's comment. I'm not sure why you've taken it upon yourself to advocate any particular opinion to me. But as long as you're here: You go so far as to accuse the OP of having some sort of genetic mental deficiency in order to further your assertions; that's extremely unkind; yet when her husband says unkind things, you say he's not treating her with human decency.", "Like another commenter pointed out: your behavior seems kinda like ADD, so you might want to look into that.", "In your opinion, the effort you make should negate his complaints even if you continue to do things that upset him. On one hand you say he's kind and good to you, then you defend your continued inconsiderate treatment of him and his wishes by accusing him of being abusive. SMH.\n\nYou've told him how you wish to be treated, repeatedly, and he's repeatedly told you how he wishes you to behave with more consideration for him. You aren't even making an effort to see things from his perspective, so he tells you that you behave like you're entitled to behave however you like, and in that he clearly has you pegged.", "Sad to read that, stand up and stright him up or divorce. Anyway goodluck!", "While I agree with him being abusing and they should definitely get a divorce because he's about as good at communicating as a brick I too would be kinda disappointed if for the millionth time the shower head was not put back in place and just left lying in the shower. No, it doesn't damage it, but OP is an adult and should be capable of tidying up after herself. OP does seem to be a bit careless, but that in no way constitutes name calling", "It was mostly food stuck on the pan and some discolouration. With baking soda and boiling water it came off. With the shower head, we have two shower head holders, one of them doesn\u2019t hold the weight of the head very well. It works when the water is on, but the moment the water is switched off the head would \u201calmost\u201d fall out of the holder and holder can bend the metal on the shower head if that continues. I don\u2019t forget about all the time continuously, I remember for a while and then forget about it at one instance. Maybe after the 4th time re minded me, it never happened again. But I don\u2019t appreciate the way he speaks to me, especially knowing that I am working on it which shows I care. Unfortunately it is hard to change the way I am (forgetful and clumsy), but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so unforgiving considering none of these things actually cause harm or severe consequences.", "I think you are horrible. I personally could not live with someone as judgemental as you admitted you are.", "Wow way to just gloss over the fact that OP\u2019s husband is abusive. But yeah she burned a pan so much worse. Your comment is disgusting.", "I have to know. You\u2019re a man right?", "Yeah, no, your husband is definitely in the wrong and you'd be wise to leave if his behavior doesn't change", "I was trying to look at this from outside, and the fact we only have her version of events here."]}
