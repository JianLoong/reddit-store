He is easily agitated when things don\u2019t go his way and has a hard time accepting deviations from his expectations or plans. \n\nIn his words, I am clumsy and absent. Which is true to an extent, but I try my best not to make the same mistakes. However doesn\u2019t matter how hard I try, I still do. My strength lies somewhere else, I grew up not required to do housework, spent majority of time studying that\u2019s why I have better income and more financially organised. I learned to do housework, cooking and general practical things in my adulthood. \n\nThe problem is that he wants me to apologise for every mistake I\u2019ve made. His face and voice would completely change, looks at me like I\u2019m his child, say things like \u201cI don\u2019t need your explanation and excuses. What are you supposed to say? You\u2019re sorry\u201d. Instances of mistakes include, burning a stainless steel pan that we just bought (food stuck on it with some discolouration which later on all came off), forget to put the shower head back to its place after shower (because it can cause damage to the shower head in the long run), didn\u2019t plan a trip properly. The worst of all, he would call me \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cuseless\u201d, \u201cfailure\u201d, \u201cwhat a child\u201d, \u201cspoiled princess\u201d and more insulting languages. \n\nI apologised in the earlier times but it seemed to only justify his attitude to \u201ceducate\u201d me. Even tho I felt apologetic for my doing, after being talked down by him and seeing his face change, I just don\u2019t want to apologise anymore. So I started to refuse. I am making an effort with visible improvement. I am now doing most of the housework and cooking and has been more aware of details. Sometimes it takes time to learn and maybe after 3-5 times of repeating the same mistakes, I truly learn. He gets really upset if I don\u2019t apologise, but I get really anxious and guilty when his face changes. I just wish that he\u2019s more tolerant seeing that I\u2019m working on myself. He claims that not apologising is the reason why he calls me these insulting things (which he thinks are just truth). \n\nI told him I\u2019m considering a divorce because I can\u2019t handle his abusive language. Despite he\u2019s been a supportive and caring husband all these years. He moved country for me and took care of me physically all the time. He is a kind person, but he just has his baggage from childhood that he needs to realize and resolve on his own. Unfortunately he\u2019s not curious and inquisitive enough to look into that. \n\nOf course I know there\u2019s no excuse for his verbal abuse, but Is this norma/justifiedl for wanting an apology for every mistakes?", "created_utc": 1701944790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cspvp/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_for_every_little/", "score": 408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

SMH\n\nEDIT: isn't there a movie with this theme?

His only \"baggage\" is that, at some point in his life, he got the idea that verbally abusing women is okay. I'm glad you were able to recognise it. It takes a strong person to stand up against an abuser, and resist their manipulation. \n\nYou say that this post is just about apologies - but it isn't. You are asking us whether he'd be right if we disregard the verbal abuse - why? Ultimately, I think you should ask yourself why the whole \"are apologies required\" issue is important to you at all. It's absolutely irrelevant, and the only person who wants you to care about it is your husband, because it will distract you from the real problem - his utter disrespect to you.\n\nBut, to answer your question... while a quick \"oops!\" or \"sorry!\" is what most people say after being clumsy, demanding a full-on apology would be insane. Yes, if someone accidentally stepped on my foot and didn't react *at all*, I'd be put off - to me, it would seem like the person doesn't care. But if he is asking you to properly apologise every single time, and insults you if you don't, he is trying to instill feelings of guilt or inadequacy into you.\n\nIt was never about apologising.

There is a huge difference between the two.  ==  I have walked in on \"burning\" stainless steel pans.  In one case, a grease fire had broken out because my ex had left the (gas) fire on high and walked away to take a bath.

However, I am advising you to seek help, urgently. Marriage counseling might work and it can open up a door for your husband to find personal help for his own traumatic past as well. If he refuses to go to therapy with you, you know what to do. You can not carry a relationship by yourself, and you also can not fix him.

It shouldn't be super taxing on any of us to issue a well-meaning and sincere apology for small things that could or did damage property, create extra wear and tear. Things start to turn at 'didn't plan a trip properly.' Without all the details it's hard to comment on but in general if he was willing to let you do the work, he also has to be willing to adjust to your plans - by abdicating any responsibility for planning it himself, whatever shortcoming you might have had is equally his own.
