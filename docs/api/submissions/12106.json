This means the kids miss their dad and miss their brother. So they struggle with the new blended family. They call me Robbie and say I'm married to their mom when others ask. They call mine and Gracie's four month old son their half brother. We have no problem with this because, well, it's true and they don't hate him or seem to resent him and we'd like to keep it that way. I know that forcing the issue of dropping step and half almost never ends well. The kids are in therapy. We have dabbled in some family therapy but all agree for now individual is more important because they have a lot to process. My stepkids are now 11, 9 and 8.

The house was crazy and when I was like 7 my parents decided we all needed to go to family therapy.

Honestly it left me feeling worthless and fearful that maybe something bad would happen if I was alone with them. It didn't. But I also remember my sister having night terrors of them screaming at each other. My parents always said they handled it the correct way but it wasn't enough. They don't acknowledge that it harmed my sister and I and that our half siblings have nothing to do with any of us.\n\nEver since my son was born they have been vocal about what I need to do and telling me I should not allow them to say half, that I should do this or not allow that. The other day I snapped and told them I didn't need their advice on stepparenting and blending families when theirs failed and they still believe they did everything perfectly. Not to mention the trauma they left their younger two kids with from dealing with their decisions. My parents were offended and told me there was no need to be so harsh and I should always learn from those with experience. I told them I did learn. Just not the way they wanted me to.

I still stand by they did wrong on some counts and should own up to it. But I still feel like I might have been overly harsh/rude with my parents.

That's all you can do.\n\nYour parents will probably never stop telling you what they think tho, so just come up with a line to shut down the conversation and stick to it.\n\n\"We're happy with our arrangement thanks\" and change the subject.  If they persist, say it again.", "NTA.  It sounds like you are acting with great thoughtfulness, care, and delicacy.  It sounds like your stepkids are getting to have a very healthy amount of say in how things progress, and you\u2019re treating them with a lot of empathy (and a bit of sympathy).  Letting the kids lead the relationships in blended families, and have the primary input in how they relate to their step-parent, is usually the healthiest way to do things.  Your focus on their needs instead of your wants is an admirable and healthy attitude.  Your respect for their autonomy and grieving process is something more stepparents need.", "NTA. I think being able to stand firmly in how you wish to care for your children is something that you should be allowed to do without feeling as if you are selfish as a result. It\u2019s clear that you feel on some sort of level that your parents failed to follow through with the advice that they themselves have attempted to go through themselves\u2014 and I feel that, if that\u2019s the case, then you should be allowed to deny them the right to offer that advice if they themselves failed. If they failed you, then why should you offer them the chance to fail your own children?", "NTA\n\nIf your parent's methods were so good, you would have already been using them. You have nothing to apologize for. If anything, your parents should apologize for trying to be backseat drivers.", "NTA - you\u2019re allowed to be honest with your parents and if they can\u2019t handle that then so be it.", "Nta.  You are approaching this with a lot of thoughtful reckoning: your own experiences have taught you and your parents need to hear this is they won't back off.", "NTA - it\u2019s the truth", "NTA you are dealing with things really well and in an appropriate way,  your parents did everything you shouldn't to have a happy blended family and still don't see thier actions is why thier kids don't talk.  Giving love understanding and RESPECT of the kids feelings as you are will make them so much more accepting of additional siblings and you as a trusted adult,  they may never use the titles your parents what but they should grow to trust you and hopefully love the baby.  A complete lack of expectation and a lot of love and support towards my step child made ours work even with a much older child.", "NTA it sounds like you and your wife are approaching the matter of a blended family with compassion, realism, and in your case appalling experience. Far better for your stepkids to be allowed to decide what kind of relationship they would like to have with you, and in the meantime see you as an okay guy, than a situation full of resentment. \n\nYour parents are off their rockers and they are the ones who owe you an apology. Several, really. I also think that the therapist massively failed you and your sister by allowing the two of you to be exposed to those sessions.", "You're NTA. It's too bad they never learned that unsolicited advice is unwanted advice. When it comes up again, but you should have a list of specific examples to cite that show how not perfectly their techniques worked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For lots of reasons, chief among them your personal experience, the added dimension of grief for a deceased parent in your new family structure, and the fact that every experience of blending families is different.\n\nThey need to leave you to deal with this.

Good luck.", "NTA Telling your parents to butt out was the right thing to do. It sounds to me you and your wife are doing everything right. Why fix what's not broken? No apologies necessary.", "Yeah, I feel like I have learned from my own childhood blended family and friends' experiences when we were kids. I know how easy it is to alienate a kid who has lost their parent and make them reluctant to ever give you the time of day if they feel their deceased parents place is threatened or being erased. I never want that for them. Neither does Gracie. Their happiness and wellbeing is essential.", "This is exactly right.", "Oh, the advice they gave is almost exactly what they did. But it worked horrendously. My half siblings resent me and my sister because we were half siblings and they were told over and over again that it was wrong to say that and was rude to think of us in that way because it didn't matter who our parents were or weren't. They also exposed us to a lot of uncontrolled anger and yelling that we could have been protected from if we as little kids weren't forced to sit in a room while they yelled and cursed at each other for 45 minutes every session. The therapist even suggested we shouldn't be there but our parents insisted because we were all the family and they would not leave us out like our siblings wanted. They will never acknowledge any of it though and yet expect me to do as they did. I don't want my stepkids to hate or resent me in 30 years like my half siblings do them.", "That's amazing, sounds like you and Gracie are good parents. \n\nEven if the kids take time to adjust now when they're adults they'll appreciate that you let them process these feelings and gave them a safe stable home.  \n\nAll the best!", "With all that you\u2019ve said, I see no reason to take even an /iota/ of their advice anywhere but to the trash. You seem to be coming from a place where your experiences have shaped the way you wish to treat your children in a positive (i.e. your parents may have ruined things for you but you won\u2019t ruin things for your children) so I reinforce what I said. You aren\u2019t the asshole for establishing your boundaries. Wanting better for your children than you received is the kindest thing a parent can do, and I\u2019m glad you have advocated for your kids."]}
