My half siblings resent me and my sister because we were half siblings and they were told over and over again that it was wrong to say that and was rude to think of us in that way because it didn't matter who our parents were or weren't. They also exposed us to a lot of uncontrolled anger and yelling that we could have been protected from if we as little kids weren't forced to sit in a room while they yelled and cursed at each other for 45 minutes every session. The therapist even suggested we shouldn't be there but our parents insisted because we were all the family and they would not leave us out like our siblings wanted. They will never acknowledge any of it though and yet expect me to do as they did.

I wouldn\u2019t even dream of referring to my baby sister in that way, but it took a LONG time for us to learn. It was 5 years into their relationship that our brother was born, we never dropped the first name title for his dad, as our dad is around and wonderful but our brother is our brother and his dad and I had a great relationship.

Your wife should probably tell them she\u2019s not trying to replace them with the baby. Both of you should tell them you\u2019re not trying to replace the previous family, just adding to the current one and it\u2019s up to them how they want y\u2019all\u2019s relationship to be.

There was no reason to snap.", "NTA. Telling someone the truth isn\u2019t being disrespectful. The older generation really needs to learn that.", "NTA. You are a new parent at 41, so maybe you haven't heard of the \"Nod & Smile\" technique. New parents need this a lot. Nod. Smile. \"Thanks for your suggestion. We will think about it.\" Then move on. Repeat as needed.", "NTA. I don't remember the exact quote or even where it came from, but since I was a teenager I've always carried this with me. It was a story like a man was a raging alcoholic, drank all day every day. He had two sons. One son grew up and was a drinker just like his father. The other son never had even a sip of alcohol in his life. When asked why they made the choices they did regarding drinking, they both gave the same answer, \"I learned on my father's knee.\" That always stuck with me, especially since becoming a parent myself. All of us (usually) make decisions that we feel are best for our own kids and our own circumstances to best benefit our own families. In most situations, there is no \"right\" way to do things...just \"righf for us.\" We grow up and look back at the choices our own parents made with us and make our own parenting choices based on those experiences. Sometimes, we do things exactly the way our parents did because it worked well for us, didn't cause lasting problems and it's what we know. Other times, we do exactly the opposite of what our parents did because it dod not work for us, it did cause us lasting problems and we learn and grow and try to be better and do better so our kids don't suffer the way we did. Totally valid. \n\nYou are absolutely making the right choice for yourself and your kids by learning from the mistakes they made and the trauma you experienced as a result of their mistakes. They very well may feel like the way things played out with you and your siblings was the right move. And maybe it *was* better than whatever else they had tried. But **you** suffered for it and you absolutely should not let anyone, parents or not, change your mind. You are choosing to do things differently than they did because you don't want to put your own children through an ordeal that had a tremendous (negative) impact on you as a child. Regardless of what they feel was best for them or for the family as a unit, it wasn't best for **YOU** and that's what's important. \n\nI think you're doing great. Blended families are difficult to navigate and are far from cookie cutter one size fits all. The death of one of the parents involved, the alienation from an older sibling, the new baby...they all impact the feelings and perspectives of the other children. I think it's wonderful that you're not pushing them and forcing labels on them that they're uncomfortable with. The absolute best way to get your kids to feel like you're all family is to treat them that way. Sounds like you're doing just that. If you continue to be a good dad, treat all the kids with kindness and love and respect, and respect their boundaries and choices when it comes to labels and titles, I think the family dynamic will eventually develop organically without having to traumatize or force anyone.", "Can I ask you if your relationship with your older siblings improved as an adult, if you had the chance to talk about it?\nI think you're doing a great job with your stepchildren, putting their feelings first.\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWhy do your parents think their methods are actually good when you and your sister have trauma and (if I understand correctly) no one really has relationships with your half-siblings? \n\nRegardless, keep shutting them down.", "I think it was the step-siblings who said that to OP. I had to read it a couple of times to be sure, lol", "It has not improved and no, there was no chance to talk about it. I haven't seen any of them in more than a decade.", "My mother and father never ever told my brother how to raise his kids. \n\nFor sure they had opinions, but they kept them to themselves (occasionally sharing them with me bc they knew I was a vault - I've never said a thing myself and never would).\n\nIt always blows my mind to see all the stories of interfering grandparents. A grandparent or aunt/uncle's role is to be helpful (within reason) when asked and otherwise to keep a lid on it. \n\nObviously if you see/suspect abuse that's a different thing.\n\nOP, to the best of your ability ignore them. \n\n\"Mom, Dad, they're our kids we're going to raise them our way. We don't owe you an explanation, though I have nonetheless provided one. If you are unable to be supportive you will have a reduced role in the life of our family. Ball is in your court, so figure out whether you want to be involved or not, but we are done having this conversation with you. If you keep raising it as an issue you will only drive us away.\"", "I never understand why people are so opposed to the labels \"half\" and \"step\" siblings. I grew up fully aware I had three older half-brothers. They were all late teens/20 when my parents had me and my sister, and only one ever lived at home with us until I was about five (the other two lived with their mom). And it was never weird calling them half-brothers or referring to them that way to my friends. If a friend didn't understand, we explained it as it was explained to us: we have the same dad but not the same mom, so we only share 1/2 parents, and 1/2 is half. Easy peasy for kids to understand and this was thirty+ years ago. Now that we're adults, I simply refer to them as my brothers, because we were able to create our own relationships without being forced into the role of full-on siblings (which I know for a fact the boys would have resented but that's a whole other story for another sub).", "Well, I'm glad that you and your wife have chosen a better and healthier path for your family.", "Yeah, your parent/therapist royally screwed up the group therapy.  the therapist probably should have worked with people individually at fist to get a grip on everyone's issues before gradually working in group therapy in a controlled manner.  Just starting with an open platform for everyone to air their grievances is often pretty counter productive."]}
