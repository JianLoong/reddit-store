They also exposed us to a lot of uncontrolled anger and yelling that we could have been protected from if we as little kids weren't forced to sit in a room while they yelled and cursed at each other for 45 minutes every session. The therapist even suggested we shouldn't be there but our parents insisted because we were all the family and they would not leave us out like our siblings wanted.

It was 5 years into their relationship that our brother was born, we never dropped the first name title for his dad, as our dad is around and wonderful but our brother is our brother and his dad and I had a great relationship.

There was no reason to snap.", "NTA. Telling someone the truth isn\u2019t being disrespectful. The older generation really needs to learn that.", "NTA. You are a new parent at 41, so maybe you haven't heard of the \"Nod & Smile\" technique. New parents need this a lot. Nod. Smile. \"Thanks for your suggestion. We will think about it.\" Then move on. Repeat as needed.", "NTA. I don't remember the exact quote or even where it came from, but since I was a teenager I've always carried this with me. It was a story like a man was a raging alcoholic, drank all day every day. He had two sons. One son grew up and was a drinker just like his father. The other son never had even a sip of alcohol in his life. When asked why they made the choices they did regarding drinking, they both gave the same answer, \"I learned on my father's knee.\" That always stuck with me, especially since becoming a parent myself. All of us (usually) make decisions that we feel are best for our own kids and our own circumstances to best benefit our own families. In most situations, there is no \"right\" way to do things...just \"righf for us.\" We grow up and look back at the choices our own parents made with us and make our own parenting choices based on those experiences. Sometimes, we do things exactly the way our parents did because it worked well for us, didn't cause lasting problems and it's what we know. Other times, we do exactly the opposite of what our parents did because it dod not work for us, it did cause us lasting problems and we learn and grow and try to be better and do better so our kids don't suffer the way we did. Totally valid. \n\nYou are absolutely making the right choice for yourself and your kids by learning from the mistakes they made and the trauma you experienced as a result of their mistakes. They very well may feel like the way things played out with you and your siblings was the right move. And maybe it *was* better than whatever else they had tried. But **you** suffered for it and you absolutely should not let anyone, parents or not, change your mind. You are choosing to do things differently than they did because you don't want to put your own children through an ordeal that had a tremendous (negative) impact on you as a child. Regardless of what they feel was best for them or for the family as a unit, it wasn't best for **YOU** and that's what's important. \n\nI think you're doing great. Blended families are difficult to navigate and are far from cookie cutter one size fits all. The death of one of the parents involved, the alienation from an older sibling, the new baby...they all impact the feelings and perspectives of the other children. I think it's wonderful that you're not pushing them and forcing labels on them that they're uncomfortable with. The absolute best way to get your kids to feel like you're all family is to treat them that way. Sounds like you're doing just that. If you continue to be a good dad, treat all the kids with kindness and love and respect, and respect their boundaries and choices when it comes to labels and titles, I think the family dynamic will eventually develop organically without having to traumatize or force anyone.", "Can I ask you if your relationship with your older siblings improved as an adult, if you had the chance to talk about it?\nI think you're doing a great job with your stepchildren, putting their feelings first.\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWhy do your parents think their methods are actually good when you and your sister have trauma and (if I understand correctly) no one really has relationships with your half-siblings? \n\nRegardless, keep shutting them down.", "I think it was the step-siblings who said that to OP. I had to read it a couple of times to be sure, lol", "It has not improved and no, there was no chance to talk about it. I haven't seen any of them in more than a decade.", "My mother and father never ever told my brother how to raise his kids. \n\nFor sure they had opinions, but they kept them to themselves (occasionally sharing them with me bc they knew I was a vault - I've never said a thing myself and never would).\n\nIt always blows my mind to see all the stories of interfering grandparents. A grandparent or aunt/uncle's role is to be helpful (within reason) when asked and otherwise to keep a lid on it. \n\nObviously if you see/suspect abuse that's a different thing.\n\nOP, to the best of your ability ignore them. \n\n\"Mom, Dad, they're our kids we're going to raise them our way.

I grew up fully aware I had three older half-brothers. They were all late teens/20 when my parents had me and my sister, and only one ever lived at home with us until I was about five (the other two lived with their mom). And it was never weird calling them half-brothers or referring to them that way to my friends. If a friend didn't understand, we explained it as it was explained to us: we have the same dad but not the same mom, so we only share 1/2 parents, and 1/2 is half. Easy peasy for kids to understand and this was thirty+ years ago. Now that we're adults, I simply refer to them as my brothers, because we were able to create our own relationships without being forced into the role of full-on siblings (which I know for a fact the boys would have resented but that's a whole other story for another sub).", "Well, I'm glad that you and your wife have chosen a better and healthier path for your family.", "Yeah, your parent/therapist royally screwed up the group therapy.  the therapist probably should have worked with people individually at fist to get a grip on everyone's issues before gradually working in group therapy in a controlled manner.

One day, they\u2019ll realize what you did and will appreciate you never forced anything down their throats, that you instead focused on their healing and happiness. Ignore your parents. If they keep pushing, feel free to defend your kids, all of them, with however much sternness it takes. I promise you, all your kids will notice it.

And now that pain was unearthed and your parents got stung by it. The mature and healthy response to this would be something like an apology, aknowledging the hurt and their role in it, and recognizing that an unearthing like this can be an opertunity to repair and reconcile your hurt and your relationship. The blaming and unwillingness to admit fault is immature, and the unwillingness to take the opertunity to help heal a hurt in you reveals just how deeply messed up they are themselves.", "NTA. I'm so tired of elders interpreting emotion and responding back as \"disrespect.\" They continually inserted themselves where they didn't need to be and offered advice that wasn't wanted. They can't even admit that they maybe could've done something differently. They can stay mad and offended until they apologize for overstepping.", "NTA. Respect is a two-way street and they've never shown you any. Now I know many parents don't think they have to respect their children, even once those children are adults, but you might contemplate letting them know that they'll only receive what they give out, one way or another.", "NTA.  You are perfectly situated to judge how effective their methods were.", "NTA", "NTA", "You need to have a heart to heart with your parents and make it clear that you are not going to allow them to create in your family the failure of their family.  This is absolutely toxic for your children and you should not tolerate it.\nYNTA- And normally I am a HUGE proponent of the family working it out and remaining involved.  But the \u201cexperience\u201d that your parents are speaking of was chaotic and disastrous for their family and now they seem to be insisting that you allow a repetition of that disaster in YOUR family.\nI am a Christian and the Bible is my final word.  It does say to honor your father and mother.  But this is the interesting thing about this.  Your parents are not teaching your children to honor THEIR father and mother.  This is going to be damaging to them emotionally and intellectually and it sows confusion in the family.\nIn your case I recommend being gentle with your parents and letting your children know that the reason you are distancing them from your parents is because, for now, it is not healthy to include them in your family.  I would never recommend \u2018banishing\u2019 but you don\u2019t need to purposefully include your children in family gatherings and \u2018visits\u2019 that are going to be toxic and emotionally stressful for them.  It\u2019s a hard balancing act.  Our family is the anchor which grounds us in this world.  But sometimes that anchor is damaged and causes more harm than good.\nPull back, keep your children safe, keep your own emotional health in mind.  If you are involved with them to the point that it is effecting your attitude and actions then you are too close and need to pull back until some ground rules are established.  I am VERY familiar with toxic family and have kept my entire family at bay for 40 years.  But I get along with all of them as long as we don\u2019t spend any real quality time together.  That\u2019s how it has to be for us.  You have to do what is best for you and yours.", "I'm confused by your comment. Did we read the same post? OP isn't forcing step kids to do anything, in fact he is allowing them to go at their own pace. How is OP making the same mistakes his parents are?", "Reading comprehension wow", "I would encourage you to write a letter to your parents and layout how you feel about your upbringing, how it affected you, and what your needs and boundaries are moving forward.", "NTA.  If you feel the need to apologize, do so for the tone, not the content.", "hm I re-read it and I think it's not clear. Regardless, they sound like shitty parents anyways.", "Okay it wasn't the best writing but sure I agree I didn't comprehend that very well. I had to reach read it a few times.", "yeah, same lol", "NTA - You tried being nice and they didn't listen. Their method not only did not work but they also seem to forget that every family is different, every person in each family is different, and what might work in one family may not work in another. There is no catch-all to parenting.\n\nFrom the perspective of the kid in your scenario (many moons ago) you are doing EVERYTHING right by allowing them their space and autonomy to decide what is best for themselves, how they want to handle their new sibling, and their relationship with you. You will 100% have better results longterm by respecting each other now and not trying to be 'dad' or step on toes. you are simply another adult in the household making sure they are taken care of and supporting them when they need it. That's perfect.", "NTA. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Reddit is popping today!", "Bravo for so far dealing with a blended family delicately and patiently. This one is more difficult than most. Your step children are grieving the loss of their father. They also have another sibling that is no longer a part of their lives. Throw in the new family and this is a lot for them to deal with. I wish your parents had been as supportive of your siblings and you. Tell them you heard their suggestions but that isn\u2019t the best path for your family. Good luck on everything. NTA", "NTA  \n\nPlease limit your parents' being around the children so they don't try to shove their toxic crap at them.", "By insisting that you refer to each other as siblings, your parents were -- whether intentionally or not -- sending the message that half-sibling relationships are \"less than.\" No wonder it caused problems.", "NTA. Sounds like you did learn from your personal experience and are doing it better than before.", "NTA. Hang in there. Between the lessons you learned from childhood (\ud83d\ude22) and the steps you and your wife are taking, I think it\u2019s going to work out. Good luck.", "\"yes, I did learn a lot. You were a nearly perfect BAD example\" - a thing I said to my own mother once or twice. She didn't like it either but it was the truth and even she couldn't disagree.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Stepkid here. 10/10. Good job OP. You\u2019re being very respectful of your step kids.", "NTA\n\nThey've never accepted any blame for what they did to you and your little sister. OMG! You owe them nothing. At this moment, you are respecting your stepchildren & giving them room to grieve their loss & adjust to their new life. You are emotionally supporting them in a way your parents never supported any of their children.", "NTA - don't let them be alone with your step kids, because they will say something ; and any progress with them will be out the window.", "NTA. And you were absolutely correct...\n\n>I should always learn from those with experience. I told them I did learn.\n\nYou learned exactly what NOT to do, so you are doing the opposite, EXACTLY as you should! YOU dont owe any apologies. Your parents do, for butting in where they werent asked.  \nI would personally go very low contact with them until your family reaches a more even keel and I would also make sure there is ZERO alone time between GPs and ANY of the kids. I have a sneaking suspicion they would try to \"fix it\" for you since you are 'so unwisely not listening to their superior knowledge /s' thereby increasing any resentment aimed your way and undoing all the progress you, your wife and therapy have accomplished. \n\nGood luck OP. Steer the course! You are doing great!", "Sounds like mom and dad refused to follow the therapist's suggestions. I would bet the therapist probably did try that. After the first visit for sure, once they realized what they were actually dealing with.", "NTA. This is your family. You do not need unsolicited advice. Lovely how they criticize you, but get offended when you criticize them. I\u2019m so terribly sorry that you and your younger sister were subjected to such abuse during family therapy. One wonders what the therapist was thinking.", "I love a story where the step-parent tries to meet the step-child where they (the step-child) are. You\u2019re doing good work for your step-kids and it sounds like your step-kids are responding really well to it!"]}
