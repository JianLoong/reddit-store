Gracie was a widow with 3 young kids when we married. She was actually separated when he died. He also had a son who is now 17 who is not in the lives of my stepkids because his mother and maternal grandparents used alienation against Gracie's late husband and her children. This means the kids miss their dad and miss their brother. So they struggle with the new blended family. They call me Robbie and say I'm married to their mom when others ask. They call mine and Gracie's four month old son their half brother. We have no problem with this because, well, it's true and they don't hate him or seem to resent him and we'd like to keep it that way. I know that forcing the issue of dropping step and half almost never ends well. The kids are in therapy. We have dabbled in some family therapy but all agree for now individual is more important because they have a lot to process. My stepkids are now 11, 9 and 8. We have okay days and we have bad days but I feel like that's natural when they are grieving and adjusting to a new life and family dynamic and we're still a work in progress.\n\nSo I was in my son's position when I was born. Both my parents had failed marriages with kids from those marriages before marrying each other and having me and my younger sister. There was a lot of chaos when I was a kid and my half siblings hated each other (their stepsiblings). The house was crazy and when I was like 7 my parents decided we all needed to go to family therapy. I stand by the fact it was a bad idea to include me in it because week after week, for months, I heard them cursing at each other, saying they didn't care about me or my little sister, that they wished we had never been born, that we would never be a family and sometimes they would yell so much at each other and get so angry that I was a little intimidated. Honestly it left me feeling worthless and fearful that maybe something bad would happen if I was alone with them. It didn't. But I also remember my sister having night terrors of them screaming at each other. My parents always said they handled it the correct way but it wasn't enough. They don't acknowledge that it harmed my sister and I and that our half siblings have nothing to do with any of us.\n\nEver since my son was born they have been vocal about what I need to do and telling me I should not allow them to say half, that I should do this or not allow that. The other day I snapped and told them I didn't need their advice on stepparenting and blending families when theirs failed and they still believe they did everything perfectly. Not to mention the trauma they left their younger two kids with from dealing with their decisions. My parents were offended and told me there was no need to be so harsh and I should always learn from those with experience. I told them I did learn. Just not the way they wanted me to. They told me I owe them an apology for speaking to them with such disrespect.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678618428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pbr7z/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_dont_need_their/", "score": 398, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's all you can do.\n\nYour parents will probably never stop telling you what they think tho, so just come up with a line to shut down the conversation and stick to it.\n\n\"We're happy with our arrangement thanks\" and change the subject.  If they persist, say it again.", "NTA.  It sounds like you are acting with great thoughtfulness, care, and delicacy.  It sounds like your stepkids are getting to have a very healthy amount of say in how things progress, and you\u2019re treating them with a lot of empathy (and a bit of sympathy).  Letting the kids lead the relationships in blended families, and have the primary input in how they relate to their step-parent, is usually the healthiest way to do things.  Your focus on their needs instead of your wants is an admirable and healthy attitude.  Your respect for their autonomy and grieving process is something more stepparents need.", "NTA. I think being able to stand firmly in how you wish to care for your children is something that you should be allowed to do without feeling as if you are selfish as a result. It\u2019s clear that you feel on some sort of level that your parents failed to follow through with the advice that they themselves have attempted to go through themselves\u2014 and I feel that, if that\u2019s the case, then you should be allowed to deny them the right to offer that advice if they themselves failed. If they failed you, then why should you offer them the chance to fail your own children?", "NTA\n\nIf your parent's methods were so good, you would have already been using them. You have nothing to apologize for. If anything, your parents should apologize for trying to be backseat drivers.", "NTA - you\u2019re allowed to be honest with your parents and if they can\u2019t handle that then so be it.", "Nta.  You are approaching this with a lot of thoughtful reckoning: your own experiences have taught you and your parents need to hear this is they won't back off.", "NTA - it\u2019s the truth", "NTA you are dealing with things really well and in an appropriate way,  your parents did everything you shouldn't to have a happy blended family and still don't see thier actions is why thier kids don't talk.  Giving love understanding and RESPECT of the kids feelings as you are will make them so much more accepting of additional siblings and you as a trusted adult,  they may never use the titles your parents what but they should grow to trust you and hopefully love the baby.  A complete lack of expectation and a lot of love and support towards my step child made ours work even with a much older child.", "NTA it sounds like you and your wife are approaching the matter of a blended family with compassion, realism, and in your case appalling experience. Far better for your stepkids to be allowed to decide what kind of relationship they would like to have with you, and in the meantime see you as an okay guy, than a situation full of resentment. \n\nYour parents are off their rockers and they are the ones who owe you an apology. Several, really. I also think that the therapist massively failed you and your sister by allowing the two of you to be exposed to those sessions.", "You're NTA. It's too bad they never learned that unsolicited advice is unwanted advice. When it comes up again, but you should have a list of specific examples to cite that show how not perfectly their techniques worked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For lots of reasons, chief among them your personal experience, the added dimension of grief for a deceased parent in your new family structure, and the fact that every experience of blending families is different.\n\nThey need to leave you to deal with this. Tell them you won\u2019t apologise for responding honestly to their unsolicited advice.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem with this because, well, it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d Love this line in particular. I\u2019m part of a step-family myself, and while there are many things that didn\u2019t go so well, this is one thing our parents got absolutely right. Never force anything. Good luck.", "NTA Telling your parents to butt out was the right thing to do. It sounds to me you and your wife are doing everything right. Why fix what's not broken? No apologies necessary.", "Yeah, I feel like I have learned from my own childhood blended family and friends' experiences when we were kids. I know how easy it is to alienate a kid who has lost their parent and make them reluctant to ever give you the time of day if they feel their deceased parents place is threatened or being erased. I never want that for them. Neither does Gracie. Their happiness and wellbeing is essential.", "This is exactly right.", "Oh, the advice they gave is almost exactly what they did. But it worked horrendously. My half siblings resent me and my sister because we were half siblings and they were told over and over again that it was wrong to say that and was rude to think of us in that way because it didn't matter who our parents were or weren't. They also exposed us to a lot of uncontrolled anger and yelling that we could have been protected from if we as little kids weren't forced to sit in a room while they yelled and cursed at each other for 45 minutes every session. The therapist even suggested we shouldn't be there but our parents insisted because we were all the family and they would not leave us out like our siblings wanted. They will never acknowledge any of it though and yet expect me to do as they did. I don't want my stepkids to hate or resent me in 30 years like my half siblings do them.", "That's amazing, sounds like you and Gracie are good parents. \n\nEven if the kids take time to adjust now when they're adults they'll appreciate that you let them process these feelings and gave them a safe stable home.  \n\nAll the best!", "With all that you\u2019ve said, I see no reason to take even an /iota/ of their advice anywhere but to the trash. You seem to be coming from a place where your experiences have shaped the way you wish to treat your children in a positive (i.e. your parents may have ruined things for you but you won\u2019t ruin things for your children) so I reinforce what I said. You aren\u2019t the asshole for establishing your boundaries. Wanting better for your children than you received is the kindest thing a parent can do, and I\u2019m glad you have advocated for your kids.", "NTA you will think about how harsh you were once they admit how badly their actions hurt you. They clearly only care about themselves and their egos, shoot them down every time. Or tell them that you value their advice to confirm what you shouldnt be doing", "NTA. It's always nice to read about kind and thoughtful stepparents. Keep doing what you're doing, and don't mind your parents.", "NTA.  You are doing the best you can in a difficult situation and you are being a great step parent by acknowledging your step kids' feelings and respecting their boundaries.   As a stepkid I thank you for doing so.  I wish you and your blended family all the best", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI'd agree to an apology if they went first. But my apology would be terrible. \n\n\"I'm sorry I had a bad experience from your parenting choices.\"", "Yta.", "NTA My parenting philosophy has always been to ask myself what would my parents do, and then I do the opposite. My kids are just reaching adulthood now, and so far, I feel like it's been a successful parenting strategy.", "As someone who was a step child and forced by my step mom to call her mom, and forced to pretend we were a family and that my mom didn\u2019t exist - you are doing the right thing by being patient and understanding and realize the consequences of forcing things. You are in the right.", " NTA\nJust because they didn\u2019t like what you said doesn\u2019t make it disrespectful.", "NTA but who referred to your son as their half brother? They are quite young couldn't he just be their brother?", "Stepparents who know their places and done overstep usually have the most successful relationships with their step kids. \n\nNTA OP. Your son is their half brother and that\u2019s biological if not emotional.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm sorry your upset that I told you about the trauma you caused me in my childhood!\"", "NTA.", "NTA. If they bring up \u201clearning from those with experience\u201d again tell them you did, you learned exactly what not to do.", "NTA.  I hate when parents can\u2019t accept that they screwed their kids up, even unintentionally, and just apologize for it.  Why is it so hard for patents to just admit they made mistakes?  OP, you do you, give them a safe harbor, and force nothing.  You\u2019re doing fine.", "Sometimes the biggest lessons our parents give us are by showing us exactly what we DON'T want to do or how we don't want to parent. You're NTA in any way and I think you're giving all your kids the space and empathy to find their own way in your new blended family. You're 100% right that forcing them in any way will only backfire. Find a solid go to line to shut down your parents' input and \"advice\" and make it a clear boundary.", "My dad would express that sentiment as \"you've crossed the line between preaching and meddling,\" laugh and then change the subject.", "Frankly I\u2019d tell them it\u2019s an off limit topic and if they bring it up, give them one warning and then act, \u201csorry, as I said this is an off limit topic, I\u2019ve got to go, we can try again another time\u201d.", "How so?", "They referred to him as their half brother. That's what they are comfortable with and it's technically true so we won't force them to say just brother.", "Another good phrase is \u201cwe are doing what is best for us\u201d", "That therapist should've put their foot down. Having you two there while everyone vented their spleen about the situation and said nasty shit about you was abusive.", "The therapist had pretty much no control back then. It was all very chaotic and a waste of time."]}
