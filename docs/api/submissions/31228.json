So if he\u2019s got less intensive exams come exam time he can focus on them and has a higher chance of passing. And you only need to do Biology and Chemistry at A-level plus another random subject to get on a pharmacy course at university even good ones. \n\nBut he\u2019s actually offended they suggested all this and is refusing to go along with it and is formally complaining to the school. Because \u201cBTECs are for retards and I\u2019m not retarded\u201d \n\nSo I told him to stop being such a bitch about it, he\u2019s not applying to Oxford a couple BTECs aren\u2019t going to completely kill his chances of half decent university just accept he can\u2019t do everything he wants and maybe consider there\u2019s a good reason they won\u2019t let him, that being he may not actually be smart enough. You know good advice. \n\nHe then gets really mad and seemingly upset with me asking why I\u2019m such a cunt and walks away.

Him for his terrible attitude using the r word. You for belittling him under the guise of \u201cadvice.\u201d A question I wish way more people on here would ask themselves is, has anything I\u2019ve said or done actually improved the situation or accomplished what I want, or is everything worse now? Has your brother actually paused and thought about what makes sense or has he now doubled down AND thinks you\u2019re a right ass now?", "ESH \n\nFYI BTECS aren't lesser, they are seen as equivalents for those that struggle with exam heavy subjects, doesn't mean they are stupid or as he says r-word. Maybe its you and your family thats made it seem like btecs are lesser. Exams aren't the be all and end all of being smart or not. Some people struggle with exams due to dyslexia and anxiety so take btecs so it makes them less stressed over one exam on one day which only really shows they were doing well on that one day rather than the subject overall. \n\nHe probably doesn't need all the sciences/further maths to do what he want granted but have you asked why he's struggling in English because you won't get into much without a C grade or above in that subject at the very least. \n\nHe needs to manage his expectations a bit so needs to think and support to make that decison. \n\nThis is coming from someone who struggled academically due to undignosed dyslexia throughout my education. I always preferred coursework over exams due to having more time to organise my thoughts and what i needed to say. Exams were horrible for me. Its just a different way of learning the same things and not focusing all that knowledge on reguratating facts on one day. Thats not how everyone works. \n\nI did still get my BSc Nursing in univeristy despite my issues with dyslexia.", "ESH. Your brother knows what his grades are and should lower his standards but you could have said it nicer and maybe gave him motivation to study and become a better student.", "INFO: Did he actually ask for your opinion?", "ESH - your brother for using the r word and you for being harsh. \n\nBut it\u2019s worth questioning the school\u2019s reasoning. It sounds like he struggles with essay writing subjects but that isn\u2019t a barrier to Higher/A-Level sciences. Some students really flourish in 6th form when they get to focus on the subjects they enjoy and are good at. \n\nProof: my partner scraped a C on English GCSE but has a Chem PhD. On the flip side I got a B in Maths GCSE and have an Oxbridge degree in the Arts.", "YTA. Way to make yourself feel good at your younger brother\u2019s expense. This has nothing to do with how \u2018smart\u2019 your brother is - like most people he has different strengths and weaknesses. Why is nobody suggesting tutoring to bring his English levels up to the required standard?", "ESH. He\u2019s the AH for using a slur and not seeing the importance of being able to write and communicate. You\u2019re the AH for adding fuel to the fire and calling him stupid. He sounds very smart, but all sciences would be too much for any scholar. It\u2019s discouraged even at college level. You were rude.", "YTA. He\u2019s cable of channeling his focus on the subjects he\u2019s interested in with support. \n\n Ask him what he thinks needs to change and be done on his part, and help him instead putting him down.\nThe head could actually be a petty spiteful person who dislikes their job and takes it out on the students that they assume don\u2019t have good support.", "Unless you left something out in your post, I don\u2019t see where you said maybe he\u2019s just not smart enough.\n\nThe head obviously thinks the reason given was good so I don\u2019t think you said anything extra here.  Seems like he\u2019s upset that you agreed with the teacher and not him. \n\nHe\u2019s 14 - so young!  I think you have good, sound advice.  Seems like he doesn\u2019t want to be associated with the stigma of BTEC.  \n\nThough admittedly, I have no idea what the stigma is or it\u2019s bearing.  Not sure if that\u2019s bc I\u2019m in the US or just not in that field so I can\u2019t speak to whether his feelings on that are justified (even if his desires are unrealistic/over ambitious given his grades in his other courses at this time)\n\nNTA for the advice but a little AH for saying he was being a little bitch about it.  Even if he was - it would be more constructive if you didn\u2019t say the little bitch part", "info does you brother can keep up with doing mutiple exams subjects in the big exam periode ? if he can then he really need to focus on his majors subject that may come to him to bite him. If he can't still forcue on major subjects. \n\neather way NTA for saying it but i guess it is better to be say in nice words.  \n  \ncould he can apply but where compettion that may do better than him in essaies he better off piking all the chance he can get not sure if he has a target uni in mind but everything are in limited spots better sore on majors that try everythings. Eather way you can apologise to being rude to him and sti by the side and watch how he his doing.", "NTA I agree with you.", "NTA. Sometimes tough love is necessary and it seems like you were just trying to give your brother some realistic advice. He needs to understand that he can't always get everything he wants and that there may be valid reasons for the school's suggestions. Plus, calling someone names is never okay, so it's understandable that you reacted the way you did. Hopefully, he'll come around and realize that you were just looking out for his best interests.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I did my GCSEs the options I had were either double or triple science and RE was optional. Your brother is only fourteen, if the workload is too much and he is struggling then at the end of yr10, the school could reevaluate. Also just because the head of year says that she doesn't think he is capable, that does not mean that he isn't.\n\nMy mum was told at school that she wasn't good enough to do medicine and should consider becoming a medical secretary instead. She went on to become a doctor and later did an MD too. She's retired now but worked for the NHS all her working life.\n\nBasically whilst being realistic is important, you shouldn't discourage him from wanting to aspire to do things particularly since he is only fourteen. He has plenty of time to develop as a student.", "ESH - I fully admit that I am ignorant about your educational system, so my judgment is based upon the policies/procedures at my university (where I work) in my country.\r  \n\r  \nIf I was your brother's advisor and looked at his transcripts and previous exam scores, I would advise him however I think will make the most sense for him based upon this information and the conversation(s) we have. I would be honest about the rigor of the course, average scores of those who tend to do well in said course, etc. but it's ultimately up to your brother what he does with this advice. I don't think it's anybody's right to tell someone that they CAN'T do something because you're sure they'd fail at it.\r  \n\r  \nAnd what's wrong with just letting him try? Maybe he will struggle and fail. Maybe he'll struggle and develop the skills to do well. Maybe he won't struggle at all and surprise you.\r  \n\r  \nI'm going with ESH because of your brother's attitude and poor reaction to what he was told. Being disappointed that you didn't hear what you wanted to hear is valid. Referring to people with a slur and generally being a dick is not.", "YTA. It\u2019s not up to you, since you\u2019re his brother. \n\nGeneralized test scores are not a determinate of what your brother can or cannot do. What he does with his coursework and what he is/isn\u2019t capable of doing, is his choice. \n\nTeachers only see a kid an hour a school day. Teaches (and you) don\u2019t know your brother as well as he knows himself. Society have a bad habit of keeping kids down, telling them what they can\u2019t do instead of their potential, focusing on what is currently instead of what could be. Just because it\u2019s going to be difficult for your brother doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t try. He should keep the science courses. \n\nYour brother is clearly really good at math and science, and wants to do pharmacy. So he\u2019s likely going to try harder than the majority of kids around him. So if he must protest to get to do the track he wants and distance himself from people like you who tell him he\u2019s not smart enough, he should definitely do so.\n\nTeachers told my sister she couldn\u2019t do pharmacy due to mental illness. It was difficult, but she proved them wrong. I wish your brother the best of luck in doing the same.", "When I was telling him there\u2019s a probably a reason they\u2019re doing this. Didn\u2019t write out the entire conversation in my post because that would be ridiculous and I already wrote a small novel giving the context. \n\nFigured that would be easy picked up on\n\nBut edited it in because I guess not", "Eh, it\u2019s not too much for a lot of people. Quite a few do all the sciences at GCSE. I did them all at GCSE \n\nHe\u2019s just struggling with his English", "The stigma being those who are typically academic do look down on Btecs but they are meant to be equevelants to either GCSEs or A Levels depending on the level you are doing. But honestly its just a different way of learning. Coursework over a few exams taken on specific days. Honestly i did crap exam wise due to dyslexia but it doesn't/shouldn't mean people are 'stupid' bcause they got the same grade a different way. Exams are just spewing facts on to paper and not everyone can learn that way.", "Well, ESH then - He sucks for using slurs and saying everyone that goes down that particular education path is a slur. But why did you think belittling a kid and telling him he\u2019s not smart enough would make him listen to you?\n\nYour advice was mean-spirited and it\u2019s no wonder he didn\u2019t appreciate it. Both of you handle your conversations and emotions extremely poorly, and it\u2019s something you\u2019ll both need to work on.\n\nAlso, for the passive aggressive \u201cI thought that would be easy to be picked up on but I guess not\u201d line?
