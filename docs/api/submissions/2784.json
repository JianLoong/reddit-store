{"id": 2784, "submission_id": "z01vg2", "title": "AITA for calling my wife unreasonable for backing out of spending Christmas with my family after my mother rejected her cookie sample\"?", "selftext": "\nContext: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send \"samples\" of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the \"food menu\". My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.\n\n\n\nFor this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a \"cookie sample\" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday.\n\n\nI came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said \"it was done\" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.\n\n\nLater I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.\n\n\n\nAITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?\n\n\nInfo. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins.\n\n\nInfo Few things to put on here:\n\n1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's.\n\n2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part.\n\n3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated.\n\n\nUpdate: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.", "created_utc": 1668943889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z01vg2/aita_for_calling_my_wife_unreasonable_for_backing/", "score": 8792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife has been telling you for years that your mother has been *rejecting* her. She has gone out of her way to make something good and your mother's pretentious Christmas menu leaves her out every year. And now you can't understand why she's devastated and doesn't want to go to Christmas with the people who make her feel so bad. It sounds like you just said \"guess my mother just doesn't like your cooking. Deal with it\" instead of *you* dealing with your mother.\n\nWhat kind of Christmas requires *samples* to be sent for *approval in advance* for the *menu*? Your mother sounds controlling and frankly I wouldn't want to go to family Christmas there either.", "YTA- I\u2019d never in a million years bake samples to be approved.

Who makes the \u201cwomen\u201d send samples to be tested before they bring it for people to eat? If she has to test every bodies food, she should make it herself. If my mother in law asked me to make something for a meal, and then expected to try and tell me if it was good enough, I wouldn\u2019t make it. \nYou need to understand that your wife is upset because she has been told again and again that what she\u2019s doing is not good enough. I feel there\u2019s more to the relationship between your wife and your mother, and maybe it\u2019s time you tried understanding your wife\u2019s side.

For years and years your wife has tried her hardest to appease your mother, had pushed herself to the limit, and has been left completely and utterly demoralised each and every time by a humiliating tradition enforced by the holiday tyrant. And, even worse, her shame was publically put on display each and every year as other family members would no doubt notice that, once again, her food was not chosen.\n\nFinally, after producing something she was unbelievably proud of, she was once again left embarrassed and most likely deeply hurt as she was deemed not good enough for yet another year. This is the straw that broke the camel's back and she decides she has had enough of her humiliation and that she will not give her cruel MIL the satisfaction of seeing her discomfort on such a big day. She makes a boundary that many would have made a long time prior.\n\nAnd her husband tells her she is unreasonable for setting up boundaries? \n\nDude. Come on. You know YTA.", "YTA.

Can you not see your wife's efforts we're a desperate attempt to comply, to a completely insane request? \n\nMaking a dessert once to bring to the dinner is already an effort. To make a trial run for her majesty's approval is a bridge too far. And family members submit to this insanity? \n\nYour wife is correct in staying home.

My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sends. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.\n\n\n\nFor this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a \"cookie sample\" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent to my moyher days ago and the results just came in yesterday.\n\n\nI came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said \"it was done\" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.\n\n\nLater I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.\n\n\n\nAITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
