My (M33) wife (F33) and I have a 6 month old kid.  My wife and I planned a date night and we hired our baby sitter we've used half a dozen times.  The baby sitter (F20) is a college student that lived in our neighborhood and came recommended by some friends that had kids.  \n\nShe came over to our house, we told her our sons schedule, then headed out.  We were going to go out for dinner and then meet up with friends for drinks.  We have 2 cameras in our house that we can access remotely to check in on our son.  One is over his bed and the other is over his play area in the living room.  The babysitter knows about both cameras, so it isn't like we were spying on her.  \n\nMy wife gets a notification that there is motion in the play area, she pulls it up to check in.  She sees a dog sniffing our son.  We are both like WTF.  We don't own any dogs and have no plans to ever own any dogs.  We try calling, no answer, so we rush home.  We go inside and the baby sitter is holding our son and there is a golden retriever just hanging out.  Everyone is calm and fine.\n\nThe babysitter seems shocked we are already home.  I ask the babysitter why there is a dog in our house.  She says its her golden retriever and decided to bring it today.  The babysitter assures us the dog is baby and kid friendly and is sweet and safe.   I don't want my son around dogs at such a young age even if they are \"sweet\" and \"safe\".\n\nI'm getting more and more angry. This was not something she was transparent about and if we knew the dog was going to be there, I would have never okayed it.  I just firmly tell her to grab her dog and please leave.  I inform her we won't be using her in the future and pay her half her rate we had agreed upon, mostly since we used her less than half the time we were going to be out. She asks for the full amount.  I told her no, you put my kid in danger, and you should leave.  She says she did nothing wrong, but I don't see it that way.

Sneaking, since the dog arrived after you left, the dog into your house without your permission shows her lack of good judgement and negates her insistence that the dog would not harm your child. And it's irrelevant. You don't bring a dog into someone's house without their permission, whether it's a baby sitter or a family member or whoever.", "There are some things that you just absolutely ask permission about or discuss with a person before springing on them, and the babysitter failed to do that on multiple counts. Bringing an animal into someone else's house, allowing an animal around a small child, bringing a pet along with you to doing a job for someone. All of those things you need to ask the homeowner/parent/employer, whatever is applicable.\n\nNTA, and you're generous for even paying her half rate when you and your wife had to cut your evening short because she decided to bring her dog into your house without permission and you had to go deal with that.", "NTA. And she knew better because she clearly did not have the dog with her when you left.", "NTA", "NTA. Your house, your baby, your rules. She errored in judgement, that\u2019s all.", "Nta. And she had to of hidden the dog from you upon arrival, knowing that she was wrong to bring it without asking.", "NTA. She just shows up and brings her dog without checking? What if you guys had allergies that she wasn\u2019t aware of, that seems so irresponsible. \n\nI know a lot of people are saying your child most likely wasn\u2019t in danger but that\u2019s not the point. Thats not for the babysitter to decide, nor is it courteous to just bring over your dog to someone else\u2019s house like that.", "NTA, but it\u2019s a golden retriever, you need to calm down. Your baby wasn\u2019t in danger and you overreacted.", "NTA. You don't just randomly bring a pet into someone else's home. That's never OK.", "NTA. Even if she were house sitting for you with no child in the home, she can\u2019t just bring a dog without asking. People lose their minds when it comes to dogs sometimes, I swear. I have two dogs I love very much. When I leave the house, they stay at home. I don\u2019t just show up places with them.\n\nPlus she was clearly trying to be sneaky since she didn\u2019t show the dog to you before you left. Sketchy af. She knew she was wrong or she would have been upfront about it.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t get to risk your baby\u2019s life.  The problem is, she doesn\u2019t see it as a risk. But it definitely is. However slight.\n\nAccording to Wiki:   \u201cFatal dog attacks in the United States cause the deaths of about 30 to 50 people in the US each year,[1] and the number of deaths from dog attacks appears to be increasing.[2] Around 4.5 million Americans are bitten by dogs every year, resulting in the hospitalization of 6,000 to 13,000 people each year in the United States (2005).[2]\u201d", "**NTA**\n\nOf course you're NTA. Who brings an animal into someone else's home without asking? What if you'd had horrific allergies? But also it was just incredibly unprofessional. Again, who brings an ANIMAL INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME without even asking permission?\n\nBut I'm terribly curious . . . how did you not see the dog when she arrived?", "NTA, if she thought it was no big deal then why didn't you see the dog arrive when she did before you left?", "your both the asshole from my point of view. The sitter should've been transparent about having a dog, and you are kinda the asshole as well because I wouldn't overreact like that... I would keep an eye on the cameras to make sure nothing went wrong. Who knows, maybe the dog didn't mean any harm at all lol.\n\nEdit: the sitter is more of an asshole.. still think your reaction was a bit to much but my rating is changed to NTA because after rereading the sitter is much more of an asshole.", "NTA. As someone who is a dog-lover but has a child that is completely irrationally terrified of dogs - no dog-related trauma whatsoever, but the way she acts around them you'd think she was attacked - I despise when people think that it's no big deal to just have their dogs around. And laugh when my kid is scared, and try to force her to interact. They will say things like \"but my dog is like my child and I don't go anywhere without them\". \n\nAlso, what if there were allergies? What if the kid, being 6 months old, did something to spook the dog and got injured? Or even something like the dog stepping on the kid during play, as a golden retriever likely has enough mass to hurt a baby.\n\nThat being said, I see a lot of people asking how the heck the dog got there, and I'm very curious about that myself!", "NTA - The fact she didn't tell you about the dog ahead of the time is a big yikes. Aside from potentially leaving a mess, it could potentially be a risk to your baby especially since they were so close to each other. This isn't like bringing a snack or a phone over; the babysitter should've known better.\n\nAnd no you're not wrong for paying half the amount. She should be thankful that she's getting that.", "NTA\n\nWhat an ignorant and dangerous thing for her to do! I wouldn\u2019t have paid her anything at all.\n\nSeriously, some f*cking dog people are the WORST!", "INFO- It sounds like she didn't have the dog with when she arrived? How did the dog get there after you left?", "NTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t bring a dog into someone\u2019s house without asking first.  How did she know if anyone was allergic?  How did she know the dog would stay well behaved?  What if the dog hurt the baby?", "NTA and YTA. You should have paid the full amount but not the AH for firing her.", "ESH \n\nShe shouldn't have brought the dog but you way overreacted. The dog wasn't harming your child.", "NTA. Personally I'd probably pay her the full amount just as a show of good will - she may have been really relying on that income, after all - but she obviously knew the dog wasn't going to be fine with you, otherwise she wouldn't have kept the dog hidden until you were gone. I'm shocked that she tried to play it as though she assumed it'd be no big deal.", "NTA\n\nDog owners really think their dogs are so lovely and friendly...right up until they rip off someone's face.\n\nThe agreement was for her to come to your house and watch your child. She should not be bringing animals or other humans over unless it has been explicitly discussed and agreed to you by you. \n\nI don't even think she deserves the half pay you gave her, much less the full amount.", "NTA. Curious where the dog was when she arrived - did she hide it outside or in her car? Did she leave your kid to go get it? Did she take your kid somewhere to get it without your knowledge or permission?\n\nIf she thought the dog was NBD, she would have had it with her when she arrived openly - she knew she was being sneaky.  \n\nAnd yes most goldens are friendly - doesn\u2019t mean that particular one is or that it could hurt the baby by accident (laying its head on the baby on the floor unsupervised could asphyxiate the baby just from the weight, for example).", "NTA as she should've asked first before bringing a dog into a non-dog environment. I love dogs but respect allergies and simply not wanting fur everywhere", "NTA. The fact that you didn't see the dog when she arrived, tells me she knew this was wrong and therefore kept him out of sight. Intentional or not, you don't take pets along without clearing it with the parents.", "Both TA\n\nThe babysitter for introducing an animal in your house without consent, and you because you fired her for something you never discussed. Too hard to be mature enough to half her pay for the night and tell her She can't bring animali or people in your home?", "ESH\n\nShe should not have brought the dog without discussing it with you first as she probably doesn\u2019t know if anyone who lives there or visits regularly has allergies.  It\u2019s quite possible that she brings the dog to all of her clients homes and it\u2019s never been an issue.\n\nYou overreacted about \u201cthe danger\u201d and only paying her half and then firing her. Do you have any idea how hard good sitters are to find?\n\nWhen your now ex-sitter tells the other local sitters what happened, good luck on finding a new one close by.", "NTA. What kind of person would bring their dog uninvited to someone else\u2019s home let alone let the dog sniff around a baby?!?!?", " NTA. Your house, your rules. You are paying for a babysitter. She should have asked about bringing the dog, but we're you explicit beforehand about no animals? Some people assume that everyone loves their dog simply because they can't see themselves not loving them.", "NTA at all, but how did you leave the house without knowing? I'm just curious.", "NTA, babysitter does not get to determine what is ok in your house and around your child.", "Beyond all the ethical and safety issues of bringing a dog around someone else\u2019s young child, golden retrievers shed like crazy. People your dogs make a huge mess simply by existing NTA.", "NTA mostly because she didn't come to the door with the dog when she first arrived, so she was hiding it.", "NTA.  I love dogs, but would never dream of bringing a dog to someone's home without their permission.", "Absolutely NTA. This was extremely unprofessional. You don't bring a dog over to somebody's home without permission, much less expose their six month old baby to a dog without permission.\n\nThis sitter is not safe and you were right to fire them.", "NTA. She should have asked if it was ok. She should have answered when you called. She should have left her dog at home. Giving pay for the portion of time you used her was fair and she was out of line to request the full amount especially after the stunt she pulled.", "NTA. I am a \"dog person\", and there's no way I would just bring my dogs to someone's house without asking. I couldn't even imagine bringing them unannounced to a house at which I was hired to do a job. \n\nAlso, it's concerning that she didn't answer the phone or call you back, which I'm assuming she saw you tried to call. You were smart to dismiss her.", "NTA- Any of you could be allergic, I don\u2019t trust \u201cfriendly dogs\u201d unless I have been around them myself because everyone thinks their dog is nice even if they are not. Geez the pandemic really stunted her common sense development", " NTA\n\nShe\u2019s old enough to know that what she did is extremely unprofessional. That\u2019s like bringing your kid to work with you or inviting friends over while she babysits", "NTA She didn't even deserve half. She never got your permission when it's common sense to not bring your dog to someone's house that the dog wasn't invited to. \n\nThe fact that she snuck it in means she knew damn well she was wrong.", "NTA. I love animals and had my first dog at six months old, I had a dog when my daughter was born, and she had two dogs when my grandson was born. But that is MY family's choice. If you don't ever want dogs or any animals, that's YOUR choice. Your sitter was TA for just assuming you would be okay with a strange dog in your house. That's just wrong.", "NTA. Also, no one else seems to care, but I think not answering the phone when you called is the most egregious violation of trust in the whole story.  And being available is one of the key responsibilities of a babysitter. You might\u2019ve been able to work it out over the phone, and she bothered to answer. \n\nI do find your reaction about \u201cthe danger\u201c of the dog to be an overreaction, but it\u2019s your house, your rules. \n\nUnless she\u2019s handicapped, and it\u2019s a service dog. If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t know about it in the very beginning, but you can\u2019t force an employee with a service dog to leave the service dog behind.", "NTA. I do not let my children around any pets, let alone large dogs I do not know. It\u2019s completely inappropriate to bring your pet into someone\u2019s home without permission", "NTA-A college age student should know better...and for her to ask for full amount just confirms you did the best thing.", "Nta, my wife and I met while training competition dogs and we don\u2019t let our (extremely well behaved) dogs around any babies, including our own, unless they are directly supervised and the dogs are leashed.  Not till the kids are toddlers. Sitter was way out of line to bring a dog around an infant without permission.", "NTA - I agree with people saying you overreacted because your child wasn\u2019t in danger per se (unless your child has a severe allergy to dogs, which you would have mentioned) Every time you have your child in a car you\u2019re basically putting him in danger.  That being said, if it wasn\u2019t discussed prior nor agreed to that she could bring her dog to your house, you are entirely correct in asking her to leave and paying her the time she was there.  Your house, your rules.", "NTA absolutely not.  It is wrong to bring a pet to anyone's home without asking first, but especially more so given that she was babysitting, and clearly hid the dog from you or you would have known the minute she showed up.  And her demanding full payment, LOL girl what are you thinking?  Plus she didn't answer when you called!", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a dog person but would react the same. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all you don't bring your dog in somebody's house without their explicit approval. Not just in case of children but also think about allergies and dog hair laying about etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond is the baby. Generally dogs are fine with babies however there is a risk and they need to be properly supervised. And it's not up to the babysitter to decide when or where that is possible. If the babysitter cannot make that judgement she should not be supervising your baby, this alone would be the reason for me to stop using her services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually dogs are possibly better with babies then with older kids say 4-5 y/o. Because they start to get playful with the dog but don't necessarily know their limits. Ie my niece had a Shepherd, their kid, 6M was playing with him but a little too rough. The dog fended him off  with his nose but by doing so scratched his skin with one of his teeth. That alone can be enough for authorities to take the dog away. So the dog was relocated to the grandparents who also have a Shepherd. The kid still loves playing with the dog & vice versa but the kid had to learn to be gentle with the dog.", "NTA. I don't know who in their right mind would bring an animal into a persons home without checking with them?", "ESH\n\nFirstly, she shouldn't have brought the dog without your consent. That's pretty much an unwritten rule. \n\nHowever, although you were angry and upset, and rightfully so, that doesn't mean you have a right to dock her pay. She still came to watch your baby nonetheless, and, you mentioned that everything was calm and fine upon arrival and baby was safe. \n\nShe was absolutely wrong on her part but you not paying her sufficiently, even if it was only for the time you were absent, is not right either. It doesn't matter if you used the babysitter less than half the time, you should have still paid her hourly at her going rate.\n\nI used to nanny as well, and watching children is no easy feat. Especially when it's a baby or child completely unrelated to you.", "NTA. The fact that you didn't see the dog there til after you'd gone tells me they knew it wasn't appropriate to bring the dog.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe should have asked. I say this as a dog owner and former nanny... You do not get to make choices regarding who (in this case the doggo) comes into the house as a babysitter.

For either of those reasons, you'd be justified in firing her.", "Absolutely NTA. You aren't being unreasonable here. She was there for half the time she should have been and put your child in unnecessary risk (because the dog is an animal, it's reaction to a person it's never met can never be predicted). \n\nThe fact you're paying her at all is IMO pretty generous, and that was the only way you could have even be considered TA.", "NTA.. \n\nAnd NTA again for paying her 1/2 her wage. \n\n\nI don't expect anyone without children to understand that you don't bring anyone or animals around other people's children. Especially if you're babysitting. \n\nSorry this happened.", "NTA I do believe you over reacted. But that was unprofessional of the babysitter to bring her dog without clearing it. And I can understand the shock of it.", "NTA. I'm trying to wrap my mind around this... surely there had to be some deception involved on her part? How did the dog get there? You met her when she arrived, right? I'm assuming there was no dog then. Did she keep the dog in her car and bring him in after you left? Did she ask someone to drive him over after you left? All of these options imply that she did not want you to know about the dog, and planned to sneak him in.", "NTA.  Bringing a dog over is definitely a big overstep.  Clearly in her head canon she thinks she did nothing wrong and doesn't get why it's an overstep.  Even removing the babysitting angle, just taking a pet around to someone else's house without their agreement... is audacious.  Or in her case, probably clueless.\n\nShe obviously knew the cameras were there so wasn't sneaking the dog in.  She *should* know it's way out of line to do that but apparently doesn't.\n\nIf that's the line you choose to draw on no longer engaging with in child minding services with someone then that's totally fair enough.\n\nNTA.  Personally, if I was in that situation and not strapped for cash I'd pay in full because I don't want a visit from 3 ghosts around Christmas time.", "It's understandable that you would be upset and concerned about the sudden appearance of an unapproved dog in your home, especially considering your child's young age. Given the babysitter brought the dog over without prior agreement or disclosure, it was within your rights to end the babysitting arrangement and pay her only for the time she was there. Ultimately, it's important to prioritize the safety and well-being of your child in these situations and this babysitter couldn't be certain how the dog would react to your child as they had not been previously introduced. Verdict:  NTA", "EDIT 2: Changed from not enough info to NTA.  Just saw the babysitter did not have the dog with her when she walked in, which implies to me that she probably had an idea they wouldn't like it.\n\nEdit: How did you miss a whole golden retriever coming in with the babysitter?  Did she leave it in the car & then get it when you were gone?  \n\nI think this is a simple lack of communication.  She should've said something, so she sucks for that, but I also don't think she deserved the hate spew.

If you get home ok whilst driving drunk does it mean it was safe? No. For a parent nothing will trump the safety of your child and even if the chance of incident is low, you would never forgive yourself if the baby got hurt by the dog when you knew it was there and you were uncomfortable with it being there and did nothing.\n\nThe sitter subjected the baby to a safety risk not signed off on by the parents which is an act of gross negligence.", "He said in the post half the rate because the used her half the time they said they would", "If she snuck it in, she knew she would be told no. \n\nBut there is not valid reason to lack such common sense.

But not for firing her. You were well within your right to fire her.

An animal you\u2019ve never met, and don\u2019t know the temperament of. She did not provide the amount of labor agreed upon for the amount of money agreed upon, and so I also believe you\u2019re justified in withholding half.\n\nHowever, your son is not nearly too young to be around animals. Children need to learn starting young how to behave around and treat animals; the kids that don\u2019t are the ones you see trying to ride the dog like it\u2019s a horse, or pulling the cat\u2019s tail, or what have you. It is literally more dangerous to parent your son to be afraid of animals, rather than parent him to have an understanding of and respect for animals. This was definitely not the way to do it, but don\u2019t think that there\u2019s no way to safely introduce your son to animals because that just isn\u2019t true and he\u2019ll be better off in the future for it. My nieces never had dogs or cats and weren\u2019t really properly introduced to pets, and as a result when they move here at about 4 and 5 years old they would scream in terror every time my parents\u2019 elderly beagle would simply walk past to go lay on the couch.\n\nSo, yeah.

Hence, balanced training where I have the ability to tell my dog no, or give a small, humane correction to tell them to stop. Keep in mind, that some dogs do not do well with corrections, and will shut down if you do them, which is why you really have to have the right dog. Also, if you do them wrong, that\u2019s even worse, which is why anyone getting into balanced training needs help from an experienced balanced trainer to learn how to do corrections humanely, and in a way that won\u2019t hurt the dog.
