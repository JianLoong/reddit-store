You don't have to put your life on hold for her.", "I mean shit were you supposed to pretend you weren\u2019t pregnant all the way till the child was born?", "NTA. She needs to get over herself. Of course someone else having a baby is going to hurt, but people are going to anyway and it does not make them selfish.", "NTA \n\nGo LC.", "NTA. How long are people expected to walk on eggshells around your SIL? You shared the news EIGHT FUCKING MONTHS after her miscarriage. Gee. Zus.", "NTA, SIL is definitely going through it but this isn\u2019t insensitive. Would she rather you not invite her and tell everyone but her? Would that even make sense? What are you supposed to do, hide the pregnancy until you\u2019re fully showing? It\u2019s been 8 months, yea it still sucks that the world doesn\u2019t stop for grief but this wasn\u2019t a dig at her at all.", "NTA. She's making it sound like you got pregnant to spite her and you waited a reasonably decent period of time, didn't hijack someone e'se event, etc.", "NTA", "NTA - You didn't steal an event like a wedding or a party, you just told the family that you were having a baby.  It's not like that is something that you can hide for very long.  I'm deeply sorry that his family did not express joy.  That must have been very disappointing.  Congratulations.", "NTA. Honestly your husband's conflict avoidance is the reason for a lot of this drama. He let his sister turn his birthday party into a gender reveal and now he is refusing to call his family on their bullshit.", "NTA as no one is ever an A H for getting pregnant just because someone else had a miscarriage, as your SIL suggested. Wtf is wrong with her? \n\nI\u2019d better not comment the gender reveal at your house & in front of your family only 2 weeks after your sister had a stillbirth. But you\u2019re def NTA. You were respectful towards her loss, this is the courtesy that she did not pay to your family.", "NTA she probably is realizing how heavy a loss like that is. I think if you throw it in her face while grieving you would be TAH. I\u2019m sure she regrets trying to do a gender reveal after the pervious loss. I don\u2019t understand how everyone is not happy though. I\u2019m sure they are still grieving all the loss that\u2019s been happening. There\u2019s not much you can do to change others minds. Maybe as time progresses they will come around. You can explain your thinking let them know you weren\u2019t trying to come off as insensitive. Hopefully they will still be a support system and won\u2019t be assholes when the lil one is born. They should for sure get therapy. Try not to stress in the mean time.", "I haven\u2019t said anything- my husband thinks I should just let it go and not cause drama and everyone will come around eventually if we just don\u2019t talk about it", "I agree.  For SIL to hijack another event to do a gender reveal 2 weeks after the stillbirth of OP\u2019s nephew was so incredibly cruel.", "Yeah I hate rug sweeping.\n\nIf they make one, and I mean one, comment/text/call going forward to cut you down about this, I\u2019d say:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think SIL would care. After all she hijacked Husbands birthday two weeks after my full term nephew died. At least I didn\u2019t have confetti and balloons.\u201d", "So true\u2014-   I\u2019m a pretty confrontation person but I don\u2019t want any extra stress or drama surrounding this baby right now so I\u2019m letting it be- but I feel old my husband I don\u2019t want to be around her anymore than I have to"]}
