You don't have to put your life on hold for her.", "I mean shit were you supposed to pretend you weren\u2019t pregnant all the way till the child was born?", "NTA. She needs to get over herself. Of course someone else having a baby is going to hurt, but people are going to anyway and it does not make them selfish.", "NTA \n\nGo LC.", "NTA. How long are people expected to walk on eggshells around your SIL? You shared the news EIGHT FUCKING MONTHS after her miscarriage. Gee. Zus.", "NTA, SIL is definitely going through it but this isn\u2019t insensitive. Would she rather you not invite her and tell everyone but her? Would that even make sense? What are you supposed to do, hide the pregnancy until you\u2019re fully showing? It\u2019s been 8 months, yea it still sucks that the world doesn\u2019t stop for grief but this wasn\u2019t a dig at her at all.", "NTA. She's making it sound like you got pregnant to spite her and you waited a reasonably decent period of time, didn't hijack someone e'se event, etc.", "NTA", "NTA - You didn't steal an event like a wedding or a party, you just told the family that you were having a baby.  It's not like that is something that you can hide for very long.  I'm deeply sorry that his family did not express joy.  That must have been very disappointing.  Congratulations.", "NTA. Honestly your husband's conflict avoidance is the reason for a lot of this drama. He let his sister turn his birthday party into a gender reveal and now he is refusing to call his family on their bullshit.", "NTA as no one is ever an A H for getting pregnant just because someone else had a miscarriage, as your SIL suggested. Wtf is wrong with her? \n\nI\u2019d better not comment the gender reveal at your house & in front of your family only 2 weeks after your sister had a stillbirth. But you\u2019re def NTA. You were respectful towards her loss, this is the courtesy that she did not pay to your family.", "NTA she probably is realizing how heavy a loss like that is. I think if you throw it in her face while grieving you would be TAH. I\u2019m sure she regrets trying to do a gender reveal after the pervious loss. I don\u2019t understand how everyone is not happy though. I\u2019m sure they are still grieving all the loss that\u2019s been happening. There\u2019s not much you can do to change others minds. Maybe as time progresses they will come around. You can explain your thinking let them know you weren\u2019t trying to come off as insensitive. Hopefully they will still be a support system and won\u2019t be assholes when the lil one is born. They should for sure get therapy. Try not to stress in the mean time.", "I haven\u2019t said anything- my husband thinks I should just let it go and not cause drama and everyone will come around eventually if we just don\u2019t talk about it", "I agree.  For SIL to hijack another event to do a gender reveal 2 weeks after the stillbirth of OP\u2019s nephew was so incredibly cruel.", "Yeah I hate rug sweeping.\n\nIf they make one, and I mean one, comment/text/call going forward to cut you down about this, I\u2019d say:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think SIL would care. After all she hijacked Husbands birthday two weeks after my full term nephew died. At least I didn\u2019t have confetti and balloons.\u201d", "So true\u2014-   I\u2019m a pretty confrontation person but I don\u2019t want any extra stress or drama surrounding this baby right now so I\u2019m letting it be- but I feel old my husband I don\u2019t want to be around her anymore than I have to", "NTA. She has maim character syndrome. She was so callous as to do a gender reveal on your husband's birthday, knowing your sister had a miscarriage a few weeks before, yet it's insensitive for you to *checks notes* get pregnant and announce it 8 miscarriage after her miscarriage?\n\nYou're not the insensitive one in the story. She needs an empahy transplant", "NTA and I wish you all the best.", "NTA, how many months is the correct amount to wait??? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. You can\u2019t hide your pregnancy forever, and you didn\u2019t intentionally get pregnant to spite her. This is about your family, not her. It\u2019s also been 8 months since her loss, so how long does she want to pretend no one else can get pregnant? You could gently suggest she get therapy because she can\u2019t avoid other people\u2019s pregnancies forever. I don\u2019t like putting a time line on mourning but 8 months is long enough to at least process grief enough to be able to handle hearing news of someone else\u2019s pregnancy without lashing out.\n\nI literally say this as someone who has had 7 pregnancy losses.\n\nI might feel more empathy for your SIL if she hadn\u2019t tried to throw a gender reveal two weeks after your sisters child\u2019s funeral. That background info tells me SIL is not exactly an empathetic or compassionate person herself. After that, I\u2019d have wanted to go no contact honestly. She sounds insufferable.", "As someone who had a still birth, if I comment what I feel I\u2019ll likely get banned. \n\nSo, NTA, your SIL is a giant one and your husband\u2019s family all suck. After SIL\u2019s gender reveal at your husband\u2019s birthday gathering I would have gone no contact. The fact your husband tried to excuse it is frankly disgusting.", "Nta. It was months apart unlike her. However why on earth did you allow her to do her gender reveal 2 days after your sisters still birth.", "It was 8 months after her miscarriage?\n\nWhile I know a miscarriage can de devastating, the rest of the family can not put their lives on hold for months.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Being pregnant isn\u2019t being insensitive. You cannot put your life on hold because SIL had a miscarriage. It\u2019s very entitled your SIL expects you to not have children because of her miscarriage.\n\nAnd if I read it correctly, your \u201cannouncement\u201d was just telling them you are pregnant? It\u2019s very weird that they expect you to hide your pregnancy from them. \n\nYour SIL was a major A H though for:\n1. Hijacking your husband\u2019s birthday celebration and turn it into her gender reveal party\n2. At YOUR house\n3. While you and your family were grieving, because of your sister\u2019s still birth TWO WEEKS AGO.", "Nope, OP is clearly not supposed to get pregnant", "So sorry to hear that- I truly believe it\u2019s one of the worst things to go through- and anyone that has had to do it is a certain type of angel- \n\nWe have had several other instances of her trying to have parties at our home for herself- like when I brought my first baby home on Wednesday and she asked us to throw her a birthday party that Saturday and when I said absolutely not (I was still sitting on a donut cushion and couldn\u2019t move) they showed up with all their food for my husband to grill and threw a fit bc I took the baby to the nursery and didn\u2019t come out. Crying screaming about how I won\u2019t let them in our home and how rude I am and how uncomfortable I made them.", "Haha- we\u2019ll I specifically told my husband no and he mentioned it to his mom but never to his sister so idk where the message got lost but she showed up with all her stuff and since my sister wasn\u2019t there I told my mom and dad to go outside (I talked to her earlier about it) and she did her thing and I cleaned everything up as soon as it happened and held my mom while we cried out back and my dad stood there shaking his head and staring into space. \nAs soon as I saw her I knew she was going to do it one way or another so I just made her do it right then so I could get it out of sight", "It doesn't seem like she had any regrets about the gender reveal at the time. She just ignored the fact that people at the party where she did the reveal were still dealing with a miscarriage that happened only a few days before. The people dealing with the miscarriage weren't her direct family so it kinda seems like she just didn't give a hit. She only thinks it's insensitive now that she's had her own miscarriage and fully understands the gravity of the loss.", "It remains a constant n our marriage and it took 3 months of marriage counseling to get him to see that I\u2019m not the crazy one", "Yeah- we just kinda told people in conversation- \nWe\u2019re not ones to make big announcements we already have 3 kids, we don\u2019t find out the gender- \nI\u2019ve never been actually able to relax and enjoy pregnancy bc what happened to my sister happened before I ever had kids so that\u2019s always in the back of my mind and I have terrible anxiety about it- so we never like to be too over excited bc something can happen at anytime. It\u2019s a horrible way to look at things but it\u2019s the only way we know\u2026", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Now that she understands what it\u2019s like to sit with that grief she\u2019s probably changed her mind on her previous actions. Even with that probably the case it\u2019s best not to bring it up since she is obviously grieving. But her grieving doesn\u2019t exclude her from being a hypocrite and being an AH to OP. OP is allowed to be happy and celebrate the life she is creating and it\u2019s been 8 months. Loss is hard but she should get into therapy not take it out on people for sure.", "I get that, but I'd think she would feel compelled to apologize for how insensitive she was for the gender reveal if she actually regretted it and now understood how awful her actions were. It doesn't seem like she can equate the two things in her head. OP announcing the pregnancy 8 months after the loss is nowhere near as bad as doing a gender reveal days after the other miscarriage.", "Yea I didn\u2019t address that too much since i wanted to focus on OP. She\u2019s NTA and that was the point of my comment really. She does deserve an apology from everyone and the SIL should also apologize to everyone for how insensitive she was.", "Exactly the above- I guess when she told my husband about it she said how horrible the DNC was bc she was about 2 month along and at that point also said she can\u2019t imagine having to go through birth like my sister did- but at that point she still never apologized for her gender reveal escapade\u2026. So I\u2019m not sure how to take that\u2026"]}
