What are you supposed to do, hide the pregnancy until you\u2019re fully showing? It\u2019s been 8 months, yea it still sucks that the world doesn\u2019t stop for grief but this wasn\u2019t a dig at her at all.", "NTA.

It's not like that is something that you can hide for very long.  I'm deeply sorry that his family did not express joy.  That must have been very disappointing.  Congratulations.", "NTA. Honestly your husband's conflict avoidance is the reason for a lot of this drama. He let his sister turn his birthday party into a gender reveal and now he is refusing to call his family on their bullshit.", "NTA as no one is ever an A H for getting pregnant just because someone else had a miscarriage, as your SIL suggested. Wtf is wrong with her? \n\nI\u2019d better not comment the gender reveal at your house & in front of your family only 2 weeks after your sister had a stillbirth. But you\u2019re def NTA. You were respectful towards her loss, this is the courtesy that she did not pay to your family.", "NTA she probably is realizing how heavy a loss like that is. I think if you throw it in her face while grieving you would be TAH. I\u2019m sure she regrets trying to do a gender reveal after the pervious loss. I don\u2019t understand how everyone is not happy though. I\u2019m sure they are still grieving all the loss that\u2019s been happening. There\u2019s not much you can do to change others minds. Maybe as time progresses they will come around. You can explain your thinking let them know you weren\u2019t trying to come off as insensitive.

She has maim character syndrome. She was so callous as to do a gender reveal on your husband's birthday, knowing your sister had a miscarriage a few weeks before, yet it's insensitive for you to *checks notes* get pregnant and announce it 8 miscarriage after her miscarriage?\n\nYou're not the insensitive one in the story.

You could gently suggest she get therapy because she can\u2019t avoid other people\u2019s pregnancies forever. I don\u2019t like putting a time line on mourning but 8 months is long enough to at least process grief enough to be able to handle hearing news of someone else\u2019s pregnancy without lashing out.\n\nI literally say this as someone who has had 7 pregnancy losses.\n\nI might feel more empathy for your SIL if she hadn\u2019t tried to throw a gender reveal two weeks after your sisters child\u2019s funeral.

It\u2019s very weird that they expect you to hide your pregnancy from them. \n\nYour SIL was a major A H though for:\n1.

Crying screaming about how I won\u2019t let them in our home and how rude I am and how uncomfortable I made them.", "Haha- we\u2019ll I specifically told my husband no and he mentioned it to his mom but never to his sister so idk where the message got lost but she showed up with all her stuff and since my sister wasn\u2019t there I told my mom and dad to go outside (I talked to her earlier about it) and she did her thing and I cleaned everything up as soon as it happened and held my mom while we cried out back and my dad stood there shaking his head and staring into space. \nAs soon as I saw her I knew she was going to do it one way or another so I just made her do it right then so I could get it out of sight", "It doesn't seem like she had any regrets about the gender reveal at the time. She just ignored the fact that people at the party where she did the reveal were still dealing with a miscarriage that happened only a few days before. The people dealing with the miscarriage weren't her direct family so it kinda seems like she just didn't give a hit. She only thinks it's insensitive now that she's had her own miscarriage and fully understands the gravity of the loss.", "It remains a constant n our marriage and it took 3 months of marriage counseling to get him to see that I\u2019m not the crazy one", "Yeah- we just kinda told people in conversation- \nWe\u2019re not ones to make big announcements we already have 3 kids, we don\u2019t find out the gender- \nI\u2019ve never been actually able to relax and enjoy pregnancy bc what happened to my sister happened before I ever had kids so that\u2019s always in the back of my mind and I have terrible anxiety about it- so we never like to be too over excited bc something can happen at anytime. It\u2019s a horrible way to look at things but it\u2019s the only way we know\u2026", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Now that she understands what it\u2019s like to sit with that grief she\u2019s probably changed her mind on her previous actions. Even with that probably the case it\u2019s best not to bring it up since she is obviously grieving. But her grieving doesn\u2019t exclude her from being a hypocrite and being an AH to OP. OP is allowed to be happy and celebrate the life she is creating and it\u2019s been 8 months. Loss is hard but she should get into therapy not take it out on people for sure.", "I get that, but I'd think she would feel compelled to apologize for how insensitive she was for the gender reveal if she actually regretted it and now understood how awful her actions were. It doesn't seem like she can equate the two things in her head. OP announcing the pregnancy 8 months after the loss is nowhere near as bad as doing a gender reveal days after the other miscarriage.", "Yea I didn\u2019t address that too much since i wanted to focus on OP. She\u2019s NTA and that was the point of my comment really. She does deserve an apology from everyone and the SIL should also apologize to everyone for how insensitive she was.", "Exactly the above- I guess when she told my husband about it she said how horrible the DNC was bc she was about 2 month along and at that point also said she can\u2019t imagine having to go through birth like my sister did- but at that point she still never apologized for her gender reveal escapade\u2026. So I\u2019m not sure how to take that\u2026", "NTA. It\u2019s been 8 months that is a large gap between her miscarriage and you announcing your pregnancy.

Congratulations OP", "Let\u2019s start with SIL using someone else\u2019s party to make it all about her.  That was AH move number 1. Next knowing about the death of a full term baby just 2 weeks prior she decided she has to be the main character at your husbands bday party, mourning family be damned. \nNow I will tread lightly here because the loss of a wanted baby is a knife to the heart, but there is a difference between having to have a DNC and and holding your fully formed, full term dead baby in your arms two days prior to your due date. \nIf she didn\u2019t have enough empathy to realize popping ballons of colored baby powered in front of a freshly mourning mother AT SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S PARTY was callous and cruel then she doesn\u2019t get a whole 8 months of dictating what other people share with their family. \nNTA", "NTA. That family seems like cancer, especially the SIL. She went through something horrible but it's insensitive to get pregnant.... what the actual fuck and then to tell people you're pregnant months after that, 8 months after she had her miscarriage, so you just pretend you're fat, go give birth then hide the baby and pretend you got lipsuction till what, he's 18 and you pretend you adopted someone.\n\nThey are out of their minds.

Yes, of *course* someone who has suffered a miscarriage will feel all sorts of things when new pregnancies are announced, and feeling those things is absolutely okay. But you can\u2019t expect everyone around you to honour your loss by never having children again - that\u2019s completely unreasonable.", "It\u2019s definitely a weird family dynamic- my husband actually has two sisters/ both have severe attention issues- and when I say anything about how inappropriate their actions are on certain things my husband thinks I\u2019m jealous or crazy- finally got to be too much a year ago took him to couples therapy and it took three months of a licensed professional telling him these instances ( there have been multiple by each sister- this is just the most callous) are not normal behavior for my husband to start creating boundaries with them", "Until after she has successfully had another child of course\u2026 but not for the first year or you would be stealing her thunder.

I texted her condolences and when she didn\u2019t offer up any info I didn\u2019t pry-", "If you don't trust him to stand up for your child's wellbeing when necessary, YTA for not taking precautions.

She can\u2019t expect you to not be happy about being pregnant. It\u2019s been 8 months. And honestly, having been through what she has, it still hurts. But no one should be expected to just not live their life and be happy about their new baby.", "NTA", "She didn\u2019t understand the pain of being a member of a club no one ever wants to be apart of. \n\n8m is more than enough time between for it to no longer be insensitive. \n\nMy wife was pregnant and we lost our twins and she had to have a DNC\u2026 \n\nWe still celebrated our friend\u2019s pregnancies and births only a couple weeks and months later.  Was it hard? Yes. But was it our friends fault they got pregnant or had a kiddo? Nope!\n\nYou are NTA in the least.", "NTA and you should have said all of that to her face.", "Pot meet kettle. NTA You SIL is.", "NTA.  8 months ago?  It is sad for her life but other life continues.", "NTA.\n\nThe idea that you are not allowed to have children for *a year* because of her pregnancy loss is unhinged. She does not get to have control of your sex life or reproductive choices. \n\nIgnore her. If she says anything to you, or anyone tries to bring you into your drama, refuse to engage, and set boundaries that your SIL in not a factor in your decision about how to handle your pregnancy.", "She demonstrated her insensitivity with the gender reveal. It\u2019s sad that she lost baby, but life goes on.", "You know what, be super sensitive. Grey rock the fuck out of them. Don\u2019t even tell them when you are due, what you are having, when you go into labor, when you give birth, what you named your little one and when they complain about THAT (because they will) become a petty potato. Say, I didn\u2019t want to be insensitive. You do not want that horrible woman in your child\u2019s life.", "Yeah don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t just cow down and not stand up for yourself. You are allowed to be happy about the new life you are expecting. I wouldn\u2019t bring up the gender reveal. As that is salt in an open wound really. Just say, \u201cI am sorry you are still hurting. I know this is painful for you. However it is not fair to expect us to not live our lives and to not be happy about our child. I hope you are able to understand we aren\u2019t trying to hurt you or make you feel bad. We love you. We want you to be a part of this journey with us. But if you need space we understand.\u201d\n\nAnd leave it there. No sense in starting a war. It won\u2019t be good for you or your child. You can stick up for yourself and your husband while not setting off a bomb in the family.", "That's precisely how such shitty family dynamics get perpetuated. Someone acts like this, everyone pretends it didn't happen, rinse and repeat.", "Right. Don't talk about. Maybe make the birth announcement on the child's 5th birthday. That should be long enough.\n\nYour best course of action is to avoid these people. I can just imagine the tears and accusations once you start showing.\n\nI won't say that they should have gotten over their loss after 8 months but it is unreasonable to expect that you should not get pregnant while they mourn. It is amazing how insensitive this woman can be about other people's feelings but so unreasonable when it comes to her own. \n\nAside from making her announcement right after the funeral, people should not make special announcements at other people's parties without their permission. If they want all the family together, they can hold their own party.", "OP\u2019s husband saying it wasn\u2019t to be mean. The fuck it wasn\u2019t. It was to gloat and rub it in and cause pain.", "Omg yes even worse.

I don\u2019t think she should be able get away from this scott-free. Note: I am currently pregnant and fully avoiding my MIL because she is detrimental to my mental health. \n\nHormones are nuts during pregnancy so good on you for rising beyond this for your family.", "I\u2019d honestly text sis in law \u201cI\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care after you hijacked your brothers birthday two weeks after I lost my full term nephew. At least I had the decency to not have decorations\u201d and then I\u2019d limit my contact with her", "From your other comments it seems there is a lot of toxicity from that side of the family. Honestly go LC with them and someone already suggested grey rocking them. It really is the best solution. Don\u2019t get upset, don\u2019t have any emotion really. Be polite but neutral.", "Lol, I am just having a DAY with typing here. Have a good one.", "NTA.  Nope, your life didn't stop, and she had no right to be upset that you got pregnant, that's insane.", "I do not understand people who think the world revolves around them. You are not an AH. Your sister in law has repeatedly show she does not understand that people do not revolve around her life events.  I think she was an AH to usurp her brother's party.  Why you should not welcome a baby into the world because she had a tragic experience escapes me. kt", "U/rough_Start_5396 me too and I agree with everything you said here. Whew.", "And no sex either! That May result in \ud83e\udee2 pregnancy!! /s", "Your husband and his family are the issue here, you realize that, right? Un freaking believable.", "It's going to *harm* your children as they get older to watch their father prioritize his family of origin over their mother, so please keep on this, don't let him get away with backsliding and staying there.", "It's not your kids well being YET. \n\nTake if from someone that has a wife that is always put last by her parents. Our kids barely see their grandparents. Her sisters kids see them several times a week.\n\nMy wife won't say anything to them about it and I'm not allowed to, so the kids pay the price.", "NTA. How can anyone seriously expect that eight months after a still birth, all relatives will refrain from pregnancies or their announcement out of solidarity? How can an unintended pregnancy be insensitive in the first place? All of this is completely absurd.", "Yep just go radio silence to hubby's family on anything baby related. If they ask say I thought you didn't care about this baby and walk away.\n\nSurround yourself with loving family and friends only.\n\nNTA", ">His sister later told him it was insensitive of us to get pregnant and to announce it knowing what she went through about 8 months ago now.\n\nGosh what a shock an asshole that tried to co-opt her brother's birthday party into a party about herself and her pregnancy two weeks after your sister lost a full term pregnancy is still being an asshole. \n\nI guess you and your husband should not have fucked for at least two years JIC. Wait, this is going to be your fourth kid with this dude? This dude that lets his sister treat you terribly. I'm changing to ESH.", "NTA. Insensitive to get pregnant? Where do they grow these people? I'm getting concerned, there's too many of these insane examples.", "Just gradually phase her and others out of your life. Your kid doesn't need constant attention seeking assholes in their life.", "Point this out to your husband please. He needs to get the picture. NTA", "Nah she will try and use this text message as evidence against OP to make it seem like she got pregnant as revenge or something else ridiculous. \n\nBetter to absolutely ignore / have no contact with her and anyone else who has been anything other than supportive. \n\nRemember, fires need oxygen to grow. Best to starve them. Give her no response, give her no information."]}
