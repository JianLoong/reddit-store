We've had some antique Fords, and driving them is completely different than driving a modern auto.  In addition to the weak brakes and wonky steering, the carburetor and spark often need to be manually adjusted by hand.  \n\nThe cars we owned needed to be *double clutched* also.  This meant that the clutch pedal had to be pressed down, and then the car shifted into neutral.  The clutch pedal was then let up briefly, pressed down again, and the car shifted into the desired gear.\n\nI suspect that the groom in this case is one of those guys who won't listen to anything that he doesn't want to hear.  One of his friends probably told him that a manual transmission is no problem to drive, and he thinks that he is so superior that he can just take the antique.\n\nI'm glad that you have a backbone, OP.

So NTA all the way OP.", "There was a small rise in new US car sales with manual transmission in 2022 (1.7%). Overall,  less than 25% of the NA population drives stick shift. Nothing on my North American license states I can/cannot drive automatic or stick. My driver's exam was on an automatic because that's what I learned on. Eventually, I learned to drive a stick shift as I wanted the control it offered when driving in snow and other conditions. There's also a fun factor. Most cars stolen in North America are automatic. Having a stick shift these days has become a theft deterrent, and thieves that try to steal a stick shift rarely get far. \nDriving a stick shift sucks in heavy traffic. Therefore unless necessary, I avoid rush hour. Until I get to the point my ankles and knees hate shifting, I'll keep my manual. \n\u25aa\ufe0ePros: Battery needs charging but car won't turn over? On a hill? Push-starting can be done facing nose forward down a hill, and though tricky can be done in reverse. \u25aa\ufe0eCons: Push-starting in newer manual cars is not recommended due to computer chip technology, but can be done in emergency situations.
