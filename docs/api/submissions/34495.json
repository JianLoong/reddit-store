We've had some antique Fords, and driving them is completely different than driving a modern auto.  In addition to the weak brakes and wonky steering, the carburetor and spark often need to be manually adjusted by hand.  \n\nThe cars we owned needed to be *double clutched* also.  This meant that the clutch pedal had to be pressed down, and then the car shifted into neutral.  The clutch pedal was then let up briefly, pressed down again, and the car shifted into the desired gear.\n\nI suspect that the groom in this case is one of those guys who won't listen to anything that he doesn't want to hear.  One of his friends probably told him that a manual transmission is no problem to drive, and he thinks that he is so superior that he can just take the antique.\n\nI'm glad that you have a backbone, OP.  Don't let this entitled man experiment on your stuff.  When he ruined it or killed someone he would blame you.\n\nNTA", "Ya. Id have a hard time being involved in a wedding in any way with this doofus", "I am sure he is a stable genius type.", "And I can also see someone like this - invested in having the pictures of himself driving the car but refusing to learn how to drive it - doing something reckless with it to appear cool and damaging it.", "I think most women would be, unless she is so desperate to be married she\u2019d have anyone.
