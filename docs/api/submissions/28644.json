How does he expect you to treat him like a father if he doesn\u2019t treat you like a daughter and more like a babysitter? \n\nIf you don\u2019t start setting boundaries for yourself right now, this issue will continue to persist even after you\u2019re 18.", "NTA, and tell your mom that the same goes for her in terms of being forced to babysit -- she should have stepped in and gotten you to the dance! She's not off the hook for letting him treat you like that. Your stepfather isn't treating you like a daughter, since most dads should be excited for their daughter's school dance.

It sounds like he is simply using you and taking advantage of you.", "NTA.\nNext year go stay with a friend or family the week of Homecoming so that he cannot stop you going .\nTalk with a Counselor  at school.

Keep refusing. Next time he does it just say \"sorry, I can't cancel my plans that you knew about\"", "NTA\n\nYour 15, you need to be going out and having fun.\n\nYou should talk to your mom and stepdad, though, and tell them calmly that you are missing important events looking after your  step siblings and you feel like you are being taken advantage of.", "NTA, not your responsibility, you make plans, stick with them, your parents are responsible for the care and wellbeing of all their kids. I don't know why you missed your homecoming instead of your dad, you had plans he should have cancelled his which is why I am not saying you were in the wrong calling him the \\*ss", "Thank you guys !

Hopefully it was a good wake up call.", "NTA,  you didn't choose this situation and you aren't even the kids' parent.

He is not your dad!!  He is a user. Stand up and do not let them guilt you for demanding he parent his own child.  You are not the parent to his son.  He is not your responsibility..Don't let yourself be used.", "NTA - They are not your siblings really, not your kids, they are his kids.  He brought them into the world let him take care of them.

You need to be able to live you\u2019re life. Your stepbrother isn\u2019t your responsibility. Stick with your plans when you make them", "NTA. You need to have a conversation with BOTH your mom and stepdad about this. You've been responsible for your stepfather's child for quite some time, it sounds like, since you were 10? Let them know that you would like your activities and schedule to be respected, and that last-minute babysitting  or other family chores shouldn't take precedence over things that are important to you.\n\nYou're not a live-in nanny or babysitter, you're a member of the family in your own right. And you deserve to be able to have a life and activities just like every other member of your family. Good luck, OP.", "NTA but your mother is for allowing this to happen. You should have said you will not watch your step siblings & gone to your dance. I\u2019m sorry the adults in your life are horrible. Make plans to move out as soon as you are able.", "NTA. You didn't become his daughter just so his lazy/selfsentered/sexist @ss could push his parenting duties onto another woman, and think he wouldn't get backlash just because you're a junior.", "NTA \n\nTell him he needs to give you a weeks notice on babysitting dates and you'll see if you can fit it in to your schedule.

Time you got your life back.", "Both\n\nFirst, NTA for wanting dearly to go to the dance.  I know and remember that it was a big event and you were looking forward to it.  It's also not your job to be the family babysitter, although depending on your financial circumstances, maybe it's necessary.  \n\nBut, YTA for losing your temper on him and throwing facts in his face that hurt his feelings.  Things said in anger are usually the wrong thing to say, and you lost some of the moral high ground when you did that.  \n\nYou sound like an awesome kid (not sarcasm) and I'm sorry that happened to you.  He was a jerk making you stay home from the dance, and I wonder what the circumstances for him needing to be gone from home were.  Was he earning money?  Does your family struggle financially?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
