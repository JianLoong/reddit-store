Later that month, he decided to talk to me and tell me that he was moving out. Something about \"the person who was watching his dog was pregnant and couldn't watch him anymore, so he had to move\" or whatever. ...Right. I asked how long until me moved out, and he said March 1st (roughly ten days). I let him know that because he was still on the lease, that he was still on the hook for half the rent until I found someone.\n\nI'm sure no one is shocked that he did not pay, so now I'm looking for a lawyer. I was debating doing it all myself, I think I have more than enough evidence gathered (the fact that he was on the lease, records showing when he paid and how much, and when he stopped paying altogether, even me reminding him that he was still responsible for his share of the rent), but the filing end seems a bit tricky.\n\nI still haven't found a roommate and have been paying the entirety of the rent out of pocket, which has caused a lot of financial hardship, but I'm now extremely nervous about anyone that I meet as a potential roommate after this. \n\nDefinitely feel a lot less like the AH after all this, that's for sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; He left, but refuses to pay his half of the rent, leaving me footing the bill. I'll be taking legal action once I can figure out how to afford it.", "created_utc": 1692301425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15txik9/update_aita_for_flipping_out_at_my_roommate/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Depending on the amount owed, and the proof that you paid the rent, you can go into small claims court without need ing a lawyer.", "NTA.

I'm so sorry OP, I hope you find someone way more reliable this time around.", "But, you can win in small claims court but still face the challenge of actually collecting the money from him.  Given this, OP should still do this and get the claim against him established.  Then, haunt him, any of his employers, etc to get paid."]}
