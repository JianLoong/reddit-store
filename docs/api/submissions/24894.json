Later that month, he decided to talk to me and tell me that he was moving out. Something about \"the person who was watching his dog was pregnant and couldn't watch him anymore, so he had to move\" or whatever. ...Right. I asked how long until me moved out, and he said March 1st (roughly ten days). I let him know that because he was still on the lease, that he was still on the hook for half the rent until I found someone.\n\nI'm sure no one is shocked that he did not pay, so now I'm looking for a lawyer. I was debating doing it all myself, I think I have more than enough evidence gathered (the fact that he was on the lease, records showing when he paid and how much, and when he stopped paying altogether, even me reminding him that he was still responsible for his share of the rent), but the filing end seems a bit tricky.\n\nI still haven't found a roommate and have been paying the entirety of the rent out of pocket, which has caused a lot of financial hardship, but I'm now extremely nervous about anyone that I meet as a potential roommate after this. \n\nDefinitely feel a lot less like the AH after all this, that's for sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; He left, but refuses to pay his half of the rent, leaving me footing the bill. I'll be taking legal action once I can figure out how to afford it.", "created_utc": 1692301425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15txik9/update_aita_for_flipping_out_at_my_roommate/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Depending on the amount owed, and the proof that you paid the rent, you can go into small claims court without need ing a lawyer.", "NTA.  But, small claims court is most likely the venue you are seeking.", "Jeez, talk about a roommate from hell. I'm so sorry OP, I hope you find someone way more reliable this time around.", "But, you can win in small claims court but still face the challenge of actually collecting the money from him.  Given this, OP should still do this and get the claim against him established.  Then, haunt him, any of his employers, etc to get paid.", "Yeah, I would really be surprised if I need a lawyer for any court proceedings, but I'm struggling with finding reliable information to help me get the claim filed. Otherwise, I don't really see a need for a lawyer. It would be much better if I could figure out how to file on my own.", "Honestly, I've been incredibly lucky with roommates in the past. This was my only bad experience with one, but he made up for all my good luck in a big way with all this.", "Call the court and ask what you need to do to file in small claims. I did this year's ago and the clerk was super helpful.  You shouldn't need a lawyer (they're not even allowed usually) just make sure you have great documentation (print out all emails etc. and write out a timeline of everything which the documentation will back up.). If what you've said here is accurate you should win no problem.  Getting paid is another issue but the court can tell you how to go about that as well."]}
