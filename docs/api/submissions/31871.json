I was very pissed because it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s duty to explain things, not mine. I have two kids one of whom is chronically ill and I have a full time job on top of that, my kids are fed and clothed and well-raised, and being their math teacher isn\u2019t my responsibility.

Based on only the testimony of kids doing poorly in class. \n\nYou were verbally abusive w/the teacher. A telling clue: When his grades dropped your reaction was to start checking w/other parents about the teacher. \n\nIs it credible she said it\u2019s your responsibility to teach him math, or threatened to call CPS if all you did was curse? I\u2019m skeptical.", "YTA, or rather YNWYJAA\n\n**You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.**\n\nCursing out the math teacher isn't gonna resolve any sort of problem, and makes you look like an asshole in the eyes of the school and administration.\n\nProbably embarrassing for your 16 yo son to have his mommy come yell at the teacher for him too.", "ESH - Imagine the school was literally any other place of work. Would it be acceptable for you to freak out and curse at a retail worker? No. Regardless of circumstances, the appropriate thing to do would be that you'd go talk to the manager. That's what you should have done with the principal. \n\nShe shouldn't have threatened CPS. That was petty and retaliatory.", "YTA for the language and the attitude.  If you have proof that she's an incompetent teacher, go to the head of the math department or the principal.  Cussing out a teacher who has control of your kid's grade is never a smart move.", "YTA and I wish I could vote this 10x.\n\nI'm married to an educator and thus have a first-hand view of not only how difficult the job is but also how awful this generation of parents can be with basically zero forethought or remorse.\n\nNo matter how incompetent you perceive the teacher to be, or how snappy she may have come off in the moment, your reaction was not warranted. I agree with the principal's response.\n\nParents can and should be available to communicate with their children about what they are learning. That is not a novel concept.\n\nProbably a good idea to reflect on the interaction and figure out why you are part of the problem.", "YTA you know that I don't know why you came here. Did you think you would have a horde of people applauding your childish behavior? You went in looking to fight and started sewaring and acting unhinged because your precious kid was having trouble in math. Was the teacher doing all they needed to to ensure the kids were understanding? Who knows you just want on a tirade after you talked to other parents who's kids weren't doing so good and just automatically blamed the teacher.", "YTA", "If this is real, YTA. \n\n1. Are you a trained teacher? Are you in a position to analyze this teacher's pedagogy? Have you talked to her and/or the principal or just canvassed other parents who aren't in a position to judge teaching? Have you relied on the reports of that incredibly trustworthy source, a 16-year-old with a vested interest in making the teacher look bad? \n\n2. It *is* your job to help your children with their homework. I doubt a teacher expects you to explain complex math that most people don't know, but she probably does expect you to take an active interest in your child's progress, ensure they're doing the homework, and not assume their learning starts and ends in school (because, guess what, it doesn't). \n\n3. You did verbally assault the teacher. You swore at her. That's beyond inappropriate. I can't imagine what kind of example you're setting. So on that alone, YTA. \n\n4. Good teachers are leaving education. Most of the time they aren't leaving because of the students but because of the adults: sometimes it's bad administrators not supporting them, but more often than not it is parents like you. Parents who decide that verbally assaulting them is the best response to a teen struggling to learn. Sadly, we desperately need teachers and we need an educated population. Your course of action isn't helping.", "The fact that you ran to another parent leads me to believe this falls far more on you than you are willing to admit. You're an awful person, and you should feel bad for treating another human being like that. You curse out people often. Most people do not act like that, especially in a school setting. Please seek therapy.", "I suspect that we might disagree on what a \"really complicated equation with cube roots\" is. I strongly suspect that this is actually a really simple equation with cube roots, that requires you to rearrange to put the cube root alone on one side of the equation, cube both sides of the equation and then solve, exactly in the same way as they would square both sides of the equation with the square root thing that she taught them.\n\nIt's the same math.\n\nI'll agree that she sounds like she's not a great teacher. Unfortunately, it's easy to find poor math teachers. IME, it's pretty common for teachers, particularly of the regular math track classes, to teach tricks and algorithms to solve particular problems, rather than explaining how the math works.\n\nYou shouldn't have sworn at her, though. \n\nI will suggest to you that it's pretty common for average kids to do fine in middle school math, and struggle with algebra.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  Why in a million years would you start saying fuck?  It was completely unnecessary, and unfortunately, the swearing becomes the focus and the underlying issuer was never addressed.  You've spoken to your son and some other parents whose children are not doing well, also.  Do you think you have full story of what goes on in class?  How about you have a meeting with the teacher, bring up the cube root equations and see what she says.  I find it hard to imagine that a student would learn square roots and have a test on cube roots.", "YTA\u2026you took very little information, did not verify it with more than one other student, and lost your mind with the person whose help your son needs. Maybe the teacher is incompetent, maybe your kid isn\u2019t trying hard enough. But you didn\u2019t help in either situation. You made everything more difficult for everybody involved. Now your kid is still failing math and his teacher has zero incentive to try to help him do better.", "Are you really an adult? That was really the conversation?", "YTA\u2026because you never curse at a teacher. It makes you look unintelligent and emotionally unstable. Teachers should be shown respect and if there is a disagreement, the teacher should initiate any cursing. At that point you can curse her out.", "YTA.  Cussing out your son's math teacher isn't going to help your kid.\n\nHave your son go to Youtube, search on the math concept he needs to learn, and watch a few videos.  Eventually he'll figure out which presenters are the best for him and he can subscribe to their channels.  Sometimes a student can have a concept explained in a different manner and then everything just clicks.  I found the videos invaluable when helping my daughter with Calculus last year (I took it but that was 35 years ago so I forgot a lot).\n\nKhan Academy also has full lesson plans for all high school math classes and they're not difficult to use.", "YTA, but also, your blow-up was counter-productive to your goals. If you'd brought your concerns to the administration calmly, they might have given them real consideration; now, they're probably going to assume your complaints are frivolous, based on your unhinged behavior. Furthermore, your son is now going to be known as the kid with the crazy mom who screams at teachers, which surely won't help him. \n\nSo yes, you're the asshole, but you also shot yourself in the foot. I would suggest getting a hold of your temper if you don't want this to happen again.", "YTA. Capital A. \n\nBad teachers should be allowed to be bad without being assaulted. Talk to the principal and let them handle it. \n\nIf the teacher hits your child or something, sure go for it. But as it is, the teacher\u2019s major offense is that she might not be good at her job (at least according to the teenagers she has to put up with every day). Your offense is being verbally abusive. Like put yourself in her shoes. \n\nHer competence may be questionable but you\u2019re TA.", "YTA I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an adult since you have a 16 year old. Maybe you should try acting like one in especially in your child\u2019s school of all places. Until the day gets graduates the teachers are now always going to look at him as the kid with \u201cthat mom\u201d. Those \u201cmoms\u201d are the ones teachers laugh or talk about forever! I also love how when a kid is having a problem it\u2019s always the teacher being incompetent and never the kid.", "YTA. Veteran teacher here (25+ years experience). \n\nFirst thing that needs to be done is for the student to reach out to the teacher to express that he isn\u2019t grasping the materials. He\u2019s sixteen and should know very well that he\u2019s not keeping up. His education is his (and by extension your) responsibility at this point. \n\nWhen I\u2019m in a room with 40+ students I can\u2019t give direct attention to each and every student, and stay on track with state required curriculum. It\u2019s up to the student to let me know that they have an issue, and I\u2019ll agree to discuss in more detail weak points at a mutually convenient time. At least in high school, I also expect students to seek out other resources to build upon their education, but I\u2019m a social studies teacher and that\u2019s a bit easier to do. \n\nI call home as a favor. I\u2019m not required to do so, and generally refrain from doing so unless necessary. If a parent I called home told me to manage my responsibilities \u201cfor fucking once,\u201d internally I\u2019d lose my shit, end the conversation there, and refuse to communicate with you without the presence of an administrator or through email/written communication only. If you didn\u2019t like the teachers response, let her know and elevate your concerns. By yelling at the teacher, you\u2019ve hindered the relationship between you, your son, and her. Don\u2019t expect her to go out of her way to help at this point, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t. \n\nTreat others like you want to be treated.

Try behaving like an adult and discussing the issue calmly and you will be surprised at what happens.", "INFO: Is the material she's testing them on appropriate for the grade level? Is your son confused because he doesn't have the foundational knowledge expected for the course? \n\nI ask because I teach college and I frequently have students who don't know how to use a comma. That doesn't make it my responsibility to teach them when my course is composition, not grammar. Students are expected to learn grammar BEFORE showing up to my classroom.

YTA, how do you expect to teach your kids to self regulate if you can't? \n\nIdk who hurt you but if you were having a discussion, why did you not just explain that to her why did you have to cuss her out?

Unfortunately, your outburst has tainted your position to escalate a complaint to the school board.", "ESH\n\nI dealt with a teacher like this with my daughter.  She struggled to control a classroom, when we were on virtual she couldn\u2019t even control her (single) child.  She started trying to kick kids out of FI (Canada) and my daughter was coming home upset everyday instead of being bubbly and wild like usual. (She\u2019s back to this now FYI). I tried to contact the principal, they (more than one) never returned my calls or emails.  I spoke to the other parents, and they were having similar issues and when I raised these to the teacher she would blame the students.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, it\u2019s one year for your child.

This would also have the added benefit of having you look like a parent who\u2019s been pushed to their limit partially because of this teacher and they may listen to you if you show some humility.", "Your kid could have looked this up on YouTube and you could have had a conversation with the teacher like the adult you are, but no. \n\nYTA and I hope someone yells at you at your job like that for some karma.", "ESH.\n\nThe teacher isn't good, sure, but why did you go from 0 to 100?\n\nYou should have rallied with the other parents, all gone to the principal and shown the principal the trend in grades, as well as explain how things are different with the new teacher.\n\nThe emotional stuff is irrelevant noise. You have a sick kid. You have parental duties. It's hard, I know, but it's 100% irrelevant here.\n\nThe only thing you needed to do was demonstrate that the grades are trending downward since the teacher changed.", "You did. YTA, 100 times over. The conversation never should have got to where it did. Your son performed poorly and your response was to hurl f-bombs at his teacher. You should not need to ask redditors about this.", "YTA.  Yes, as the title implies, it is a teachers job to teach kids.  However, it's also their job to communicate with parents when their children are struggling so PARENTS can be involved in their child's development and help come up with a solution that works for them. Yet, instead of asking about extra help, extra credit, or tutoring available, you start dropping F bombs and accuse her of not doing her job.... Based on what?  Your kid and one other falling behind?\n\nIf this is how you handle your child's education, you owe the teacher AND your son an apology.  He is a couple years away from adulthood, college and work (where adults won't be reaching out to you about anything regarding your kid) and you have shown him exactly how little you are invested in his academics and his future.", "You are always TA for yelling at a teacher. We aren\u2019t paid enough for that.", "ESH. There is no reason to curse at your sons teacher and make things worse for him, and your sons teacher should actually be teaching and helping him.", "YTA.  You escalated it and need to learn to control your temper.", "NTA. Part of me wants to go ESH, because it does sound like you were probably overly aggressive. But it sounds like you are in the right in terms of merits. I just think this calls for going over her head and talking to the principal about this new teacher.", "As a teacher, YTA. You went thermonuclear instead of trying to calmly explain your POV to the teacher. Now the whole staff will think of you as the \"crazy mom\" and your kid WILL suffer. Not fair but that's how life is.", "YTA - the teacher needs to teach to the class.  They can't teach to the fringes.   If they teach to the top 5% then the rest of the class will get lost.  If she teaches to the bottom 5% the class will fall behind.   Sounds like your son is in the bottom.   He will need to find a way to get the extra help he needs (tutor, increase study).   You going in there and acting like a child isn't going to help the situation.  And good for the teacher for reporting you.", "You're an adult. You couldn't sit and have an adult conversation with a teacher? Part of being a parent is setting a mature example and how to discuss problems rationally. Sounds like you and the teacher both need improvement.", "YTA you lost the high ground when you started swearing.\n\nIf you had remained calm, included the information from the other parents and ended the meeting  and escalated to the principal when she brought up teaching at home you\u2019d be fine.\n\nBut you lost your temper and now you\u2019re on the back foot.", "YTA  I always find it amazing when parents blame the teacher 100% when their kids arent doing well. The first question I would ask my kid and the teacher is how many times has my kids stayed after school for extra help? If your son is struggling that much then he should be staying after school for extra help. Also threatening the teacher was inappropriate. The best thing would have been to ask how can we work together to approve the situation. You went in there with an attitude of it was the teacher's fault and you weren't going to listen to anything else.", "Yep. \n\nIn this situation, the teacher clearly didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on, and you walked in on both.\n\nSo why would you cut one of yours off and give it to her?\n\nYou lose the higher ground when you behave immaturely for no reason. She was being unprofessional and incompetent. That would have been enough. Take it to the principal if the teacher is clearly not capable of holding a professional conversation. \n\nYou didn\u2019t have to be obnoxious and offensive. You just wanted to because it felt good. Well\u2026 now you\u2019re facing the consequences of your own actions.. which unfortunately means they\u2019re probably going to take your probably-valid concerns about the teacher seriously.. because you did not present them seriously. \n\nYou represent your child, who goes to this school every single day. Don\u2019t embarrass him by being the mom-on-a-broomstick whose name the entire staff knows. \n\nThere was absolutely zero reason for you to have spoken the way you did. But you can\u2019t take it back. So just do better going forward.\n\nTo the principal and the teacher, say something like this:\n\n*I am sorry for cursing at you. It was entirely inappropriate for the environment and the situation. I hope that you understand I was feeling incredibly insulted and overwhelmed, but that\u2019s still no reason to have spoken to you that way. I apologize for the way I went about it. I\u2019m more frustrated at myself for having done it, though, because I do still feel that my concerns are valid and that my child\u2019s future is at stake. I do not want that message to get lost just because I delivered it very, very poorly. That\u2019s on me. But this is about my son, who did not do anything wrong.*\n\n*I am simply trying to understand why my son\u2019s grades have taken a nosedive, and why he can\u2019t seem to articulate to me what\u2019s been taught or how it\u2019s being taught. I wanted some insight into the teacher\u2019s instructional practices, and was told that I should be teaching the concepts to my son at home. I\u2019m not a math teacher. I don\u2019t know how to teach him the concepts. I can help him practice if he\u2019s been taught, but this seems incredibly inequitable to me. I don\u2019t want my son to suffer because I don\u2019t have time to teach him how to do complex cube root equations.*", "I agree. \n\nBy the way, CPS for what??", "Teacher here. There's an amazing magical difference between what kids say at home and what actually happens at school. Yup, math teacher may not be great, but there's better ways to address that and make sure you kiddo is keeping up.", "Nah, my mom bitched out a few dumbass school admins, and for years people I didn't even know would tell me I had the coolest mom. \n\nShe is, in fact, pretty cool.", "Honestly OP sounds like the exact sort of person that would verbally attack a retail worker.", "I'm willing to bet those kids are failing because their parents are equally negligent and not because the teacher is giving overly complex worksheets.", "Yeah, because the teacher is such an angel, threatening to call CPS on the mother for swearing at her. And if there was a legitimate reason for calling CPS, the teacher then broke the law by not reporting it to CPS. So either way, she\u2019s a shit teacher if OP\u2019s story is true, end of story, so your fourth point is irrelevant. \n\nAlso, it is not a parents job to teach entire concepts (like cube root equations), and if a parent has to do that because the teacher neglected to, then that parent is 100000% in a position to criticize the teacher.\n\nStill YTA, but you said it for all the wrong reasons.", "I\u2019m willing to bet that the kid wasn\u2019t lying about the teacher. Not only did a bunch of other students have the same issue, but if OP is being a reliable narrator, it sounds like the teacher doubled down on being a shitty teacher. \n\nNot defending OPs behavior but I don\u2019t think it was for nothing. \n\nWhen I was in 10th grade, I had a math teacher who would just *do the math* in front of us without explaining it and then expected us to do it. If we asked a question, she said \u201clook at your notes\u201d. I complained to my parents multiple times and they never did anything. I knew I wasn\u2019t crazy because **every single other kid** I talked to with **absolutely 0 exceptions** agreed with me. \n\nThese types of teachers do exist, and if they\u2019re anything like the one I had, they\u2019re *incredibly* dense.", "He is an asshole, but it doesn't take a trained teacher to see that this math teacher's pedagogy (assuming OP is presenting the story honestly) is \"the parent should do my job.\"\n\nGood teachers are leaving education, absolutely.  They are often replaced by teachers of lower quality, as we see here.  Losing this teacher would be an inconvenience, but not a major loss.", "1. Disagree. Teachers are experts at education (or should be), the same way doctor are experts at health (or should be). If I sent my child to the doctor and his condition gets worse I absolutely have the right to question him. OP's child seems to always have done pretty well at math, so communicating with the new teacher is the best first move to do, since it's the variable that changed. Teachers are not omniscient, and are not always right and competent.\n2. Parents can't be expected to help their children understand math concepts past like middle school (depending on their job and/or ability). They should make sure they do their homework and study, but at 16 years old, the parent shouldn't have to hold their child's hand for them to pass their classes (especially if she didn't need to the last few years)\n3. Agreed. OP went in waaay to aggressive, but if she's right about what happened (not misrepresenting too much), the teacher was extremely unprofessional by threatening to call CPS.\n4. Agreed.\n\nESH", "This should be the top response.", "^^ THIS!", "Yours needs a much higher boost, because I actually was a Mathlete (tm) in high school, and I needed your reminder on cube roots to remember that oh yeah, square root and cube roots are solved in the same way, the assignment probably isn't as confusing as OP is making it sound. And if I needed that, then the AITA population at large probably also needs that reminder so they aren't put under the impression by OP's prose that teacher is giving unreasonably difficult tasks.", "this sounds like algebra 2 to me-not middle school math, a junior level course", "Regardless of how difficult the math is, the teacher should be helping the students or The kids could also use Google to get the answers.", "Exactly, as soon as you swear at someone, that becomes the focus, instead of the message you were trying to get across.", "Threatening to call cps for no reason is? ESH", "Right? Imagine being a brand new teacher, trying to get your footing so you can get to a point where you\u2019re good at your job, and having to deal with this insanity. No teacher is great out the gates, it takes time to build your craft like any other profession. No wonder teachers are quitting in droves.", "But he *did* do what he was accused of.

Point out it is a fundamental issue to threaten to call CPS, and as a mandatory reporter they should not use that threat. In fact if they believed that CPS should have been called and they didn\u2019t, they are in the wrong. \n\nThe teacher just put themselves in a bad position. If they thought CPS should be called then they shouldn\u2019t announce it to the parent. Also, if they believe that they should have called / had grounds to call CPS on the parent and they DIDNT then they just broke their mandatory reporter status.

They need pretty significant training and support before interacting with parents again. That\u2019s not how you respond to a volatile parent. \n\nI added that part because I felt this parent was going to basically say the part you crossed out either way (I mean.. they couldn\u2019t stop themselves from swearing at a teacher like zero to one hundred), so I figure if they feel like they need to get that part out, it\u2019s better sandwiched between the important bits.\n\nIf it were me, I would use your version.
