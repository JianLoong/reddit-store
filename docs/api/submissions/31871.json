I was very pissed because it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s duty to explain things, not mine. I have two kids one of whom is chronically ill and I have a full time job on top of that, my kids are fed and clothed and well-raised, and being their math teacher isn\u2019t my responsibility.

Based on only the testimony of kids doing poorly in class. \n\nYou were verbally abusive w/the teacher. A telling clue: When his grades dropped your reaction was to start checking w/other parents about the teacher. \n\nIs it credible she said it\u2019s your responsibility to teach him math, or threatened to call CPS if all you did was curse? I\u2019m skeptical.", "YTA, or rather YNWYJAA\n\n**You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.**\n\nCursing out the math teacher isn't gonna resolve any sort of problem, and makes you look like an asshole in the eyes of the school and administration.\n\nProbably embarrassing for your 16 yo son to have his mommy come yell at the teacher for him too.", "ESH - Imagine the school was literally any other place of work. Would it be acceptable for you to freak out and curse at a retail worker? No. Regardless of circumstances, the appropriate thing to do would be that you'd go talk to the manager. That's what you should have done with the principal. \n\nShe shouldn't have threatened CPS. That was petty and retaliatory.", "YTA for the language and the attitude.  If you have proof that she's an incompetent teacher, go to the head of the math department or the principal.  Cussing out a teacher who has control of your kid's grade is never a smart move.", "YTA and I wish I could vote this 10x.\n\nI'm married to an educator and thus have a first-hand view of not only how difficult the job is but also how awful this generation of parents can be with basically zero forethought or remorse.\n\nNo matter how incompetent you perceive the teacher to be, or how snappy she may have come off in the moment, your reaction was not warranted. I agree with the principal's response.\n\nParents can and should be available to communicate with their children about what they are learning. That is not a novel concept.\n\nProbably a good idea to reflect on the interaction and figure out why you are part of the problem.", "YTA you know that I don't know why you came here. Did you think you would have a horde of people applauding your childish behavior? You went in looking to fight and started sewaring and acting unhinged because your precious kid was having trouble in math. Was the teacher doing all they needed to to ensure the kids were understanding? Who knows you just want on a tirade after you talked to other parents who's kids weren't doing so good and just automatically blamed the teacher.", "YTA", "If this is real, YTA. \n\n1. Are you a trained teacher? Are you in a position to analyze this teacher's pedagogy? Have you talked to her and/or the principal or just canvassed other parents who aren't in a position to judge teaching? Have you relied on the reports of that incredibly trustworthy source, a 16-year-old with a vested interest in making the teacher look bad? \n\n2. It *is* your job to help your children with their homework. I doubt a teacher expects you to explain complex math that most people don't know, but she probably does expect you to take an active interest in your child's progress, ensure they're doing the homework, and not assume their learning starts and ends in school (because, guess what, it doesn't). \n\n3. You did verbally assault the teacher. You swore at her. That's beyond inappropriate. I can't imagine what kind of example you're setting. So on that alone, YTA. \n\n4. Good teachers are leaving education. Most of the time they aren't leaving because of the students but because of the adults: sometimes it's bad administrators not supporting them, but more often than not it is parents like you. Parents who decide that verbally assaulting them is the best response to a teen struggling to learn. Sadly, we desperately need teachers and we need an educated population. Your course of action isn't helping.", "The fact that you ran to another parent leads me to believe this falls far more on you than you are willing to admit. You're an awful person, and you should feel bad for treating another human being like that. You curse out people often. Most people do not act like that, especially in a school setting. Please seek therapy.", "I suspect that we might disagree on what a \"really complicated equation with cube roots\" is. I strongly suspect that this is actually a really simple equation with cube roots, that requires you to rearrange to put the cube root alone on one side of the equation, cube both sides of the equation and then solve, exactly in the same way as they would square both sides of the equation with the square root thing that she taught them.\n\nIt's the same math.\n\nI'll agree that she sounds like she's not a great teacher. Unfortunately, it's easy to find poor math teachers. IME, it's pretty common for teachers, particularly of the regular math track classes, to teach tricks and algorithms to solve particular problems, rather than explaining how the math works.\n\nYou shouldn't have sworn at her, though. \n\nI will suggest to you that it's pretty common for average kids to do fine in middle school math, and struggle with algebra.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  Why in a million years would you start saying fuck?  It was completely unnecessary, and unfortunately, the swearing becomes the focus and the underlying issuer was never addressed.  You've spoken to your son and some other parents whose children are not doing well, also.  Do you think you have full story of what goes on in class?  How about you have a meeting with the teacher, bring up the cube root equations and see what she says.  I find it hard to imagine that a student would learn square roots and have a test on cube roots.", "YTA\u2026you took very little information, did not verify it with more than one other student, and lost your mind with the person whose help your son needs. Maybe the teacher is incompetent, maybe your kid isn\u2019t trying hard enough. But you didn\u2019t help in either situation. You made everything more difficult for everybody involved. Now your kid is still failing math and his teacher has zero incentive to try to help him do better.", "Are you really an adult? That was really the conversation?", "YTA\u2026because you never curse at a teacher. It makes you look unintelligent and emotionally unstable. Teachers should be shown respect and if there is a disagreement, the teacher should initiate any cursing. At that point you can curse her out.", "YTA.  Cussing out your son's math teacher isn't going to help your kid.\n\nHave your son go to Youtube, search on the math concept he needs to learn, and watch a few videos.  Eventually he'll figure out which presenters are the best for him and he can subscribe to their channels.  Sometimes a student can have a concept explained in a different manner and then everything just clicks.  I found the videos invaluable when helping my daughter with Calculus last year (I took it but that was 35 years ago so I forgot a lot).\n\nKhan Academy also has full lesson plans for all high school math classes and they're not difficult to use.", "YTA, but also, your blow-up was counter-productive to your goals. If you'd brought your concerns to the administration calmly, they might have given them real consideration; now, they're probably going to assume your complaints are frivolous, based on your unhinged behavior. Furthermore, your son is now going to be known as the kid with the crazy mom who screams at teachers, which surely won't help him. \n\nSo yes, you're the asshole, but you also shot yourself in the foot. I would suggest getting a hold of your temper if you don't want this to happen again.", "YTA. Capital A. \n\nBad teachers should be allowed to be bad without being assaulted. Talk to the principal and let them handle it. \n\nIf the teacher hits your child or something, sure go for it. But as it is, the teacher\u2019s major offense is that she might not be good at her job (at least according to the teenagers she has to put up with every day). Your offense is being verbally abusive. Like put yourself in her shoes. \n\nHer competence may be questionable but you\u2019re TA.", "YTA I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re an adult since you have a 16 year old. Maybe you should try acting like one in especially in your child\u2019s school of all places. Until the day gets graduates the teachers are now always going to look at him as the kid with \u201cthat mom\u201d. Those \u201cmoms\u201d are the ones teachers laugh or talk about forever! I also love how when a kid is having a problem it\u2019s always the teacher being incompetent and never the kid.", "YTA. Veteran teacher here (25+ years experience). \n\nFirst thing that needs to be done is for the student to reach out to the teacher to express that he isn\u2019t grasping the materials. He\u2019s sixteen and should know very well that he\u2019s not keeping up. His education is his (and by extension your) responsibility at this point. \n\nWhen I\u2019m in a room with 40+ students I can\u2019t give direct attention to each and every student, and stay on track with state required curriculum. It\u2019s up to the student to let me know that they have an issue, and I\u2019ll agree to discuss in more detail weak points at a mutually convenient time. At least in high school, I also expect students to seek out other resources to build upon their education, but I\u2019m a social studies teacher and that\u2019s a bit easier to do. \n\nI call home as a favor. I\u2019m not required to do so, and generally refrain from doing so unless necessary. If a parent I called home told me to manage my responsibilities \u201cfor fucking once,\u201d internally I\u2019d lose my shit, end the conversation there, and refuse to communicate with you without the presence of an administrator or through email/written communication only. If you didn\u2019t like the teachers response, let her know and elevate your concerns. By yelling at the teacher, you\u2019ve hindered the relationship between you, your son, and her. Don\u2019t expect her to go out of her way to help at this point, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t. \n\nTreat others like you want to be treated.

Try behaving like an adult and discussing the issue calmly and you will be surprised at what happens.", "INFO: Is the material she's testing them on appropriate for the grade level? Is your son confused because he doesn't have the foundational knowledge expected for the course? \n\nI ask because I teach college and I frequently have students who don't know how to use a comma. That doesn't make it my responsibility to teach them when my course is composition, not grammar. Students are expected to learn grammar BEFORE showing up to my classroom.

YTA, how do you expect to teach your kids to self regulate if you can't? \n\nIdk who hurt you but if you were having a discussion, why did you not just explain that to her why did you have to cuss her out?

Unfortunately, your outburst has tainted your position to escalate a complaint to the school board.", "ESH\n\nI dealt with a teacher like this with my daughter.  She struggled to control a classroom, when we were on virtual she couldn\u2019t even control her (single) child.  She started trying to kick kids out of FI (Canada) and my daughter was coming home upset everyday instead of being bubbly and wild like usual. (She\u2019s back to this now FYI). I tried to contact the principal, they (more than one) never returned my calls or emails.  I spoke to the other parents, and they were having similar issues and when I raised these to the teacher she would blame the students.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, it\u2019s one year for your child.

If the teacher did indeed do just that, then she's a few Froot Loops short of a well-balanced breakfast.\n\nStill, cussing someone out was uncalled for and not ok.\n\nFWIW, teachers in the US, and I suspect elsewhere, too, are mandatory reporters. Teacher \"threatening to call CPS\" could have been a simple explanation of that policy, as in, \"Ma'am, I would be required to report that...\"\n\nI've been in this business for 20 years, and I've heard all kinds of yarns spun. This one reads between the lines pretty clearly.", "There are terrible teachers, just like any profession.\n\nThis teacher doesn't sound great, because of the CPS accusation.\n\nBut most people have been to school, and edit: *so* they assume that they know what the profession of teaching is like.\n\nIn this case, we're assuming the student and their friends are being honest.\n\nMany people don't understand why teachers are leaving the profession in droves.\n\nBut really, any helping profession, people take for granted.", "What does telling parent's they should teach math instead of the teacher, and then proceed to threaten with cps tell your instincs about this teacher?", "You don\u2019t need to be a teacher to know that you\u2019re a shitty teacher if you don\u2019t teach."]}
