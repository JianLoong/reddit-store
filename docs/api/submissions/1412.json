I was fine and was going to move on but he keeps ranting about how stupid the workers are and I take that to heart a little because I use to work in fast food even at Charleys for a time. I told him maybe they misunderstood the grilled veggies or the toppings because they are different and he keeps going off telling me they don\u2019t know how to do their job.

I don't understanding *screaming* over fast food at all. Yeah, it sucks they got your order wrong- but is screaming a rational reaction? If you contact Charley's you'll probably get a refund or credit. In the grand scheme of things, it seems pretty ridiculous to get THAT upset over fast food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s a mistake, either his, or theirs. If it were me, I\u2019d check my itemized bill to see if I was charged for missing item. If I was charged, I\u2019d call the restaurant to inform them of error, and expect at very least credit on future order.

I really hope there's some hyperbole involved. \n\nLike it's not literal screaming but perhaps a slightly elevated volume and annoyed tone? \n\nBecause everyone on here is like  'I lost it and started screaming', or 'yelling' or 'blowing up' even if it's about a lost paperclip or something. Everyone 'confronts' someone that they have the mildest, most trivial difference of opinions with.\n\nIt has to be exaggeration, who goes around screaming and yelling at the drop of a hat over trivial things?"]}
