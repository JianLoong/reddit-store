But he was completely out of line.", "The chicken is just the symptom of the negging/mansplaining disease. Next time he comes at you for sexy times, when he's standing there without a shred of clothing on, before he touches you, say 'I know how to make it better, do XYZ'. When his - ego - inevitably shrivels, tell him he's being bat shit crazy over a couple of minutes of not much (I'm guessing, sadly). Then see how he feels about it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. He hadn\u2019t even tasted the chicken. I don\u2019t usually use this word because it sucks but mansplaining actually applies here.", "NTA, but think about what you want out of this relationship and work on that. \n\nSometimes people get too focused on being right and it drives a wedge between you.  I look back on my marriage and a couple stupid fights were forks on the road that could have made us closer/better communicators", "NTA.  My typical response to that kind of \"I can do it better\" criticism is \"Sounds like you just volunteered to do it next time.\"  Put up or shut up.", "NTA You are not upset about chicken. You are upset because your husband insulted you without ever bothering to taste the chicken before trying to hurt your feelings. Now he is gaslighting you by claiming that you are the one with the problem.", "NTA.  This is very simple, OP - your husband is the AH for critiquing your work, claiming he could do better, and attempting to instruct you, **without first tasting the dish you made.** If your husband had tasted your dish, then he would have been entitled to an opinion. His opinion could still have been wrong, but he would have been entitled to it. The two of you could have had a lively debate about whose roast chicken is better (hey, chicken bakeoff!) - the disagreement could have been fun and constructive. Unfortunately, your husband acted like a mansplaining gasbag. Does he also spout off at parties about movies and books that he has never seen? He owes you an apology.", "NTA.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re allowed your feelings and it\u2019s ok to feel that way. If my hubby or anyone I cooked for had criticized anything I did without trying it- I\u2019d take their plates and say I\u2019m sorry- we have sandwich fixings in the fridge. \n\nI understand your point on trying to explain your side and then getting belittled and insulted and ignored.. AGAIN! No ma\u2019am sorry but that would have resulted in a pillow scream, throwing something, and not letting him sleep until we talked bc I refuse to go to bed angry.", "NTA\n\nIt was very rude for him to make that comment without tasting the chicken. It was even more rude if he said that in front of his mom. I would have asked him \"Why TF didn't YOU make it then?\" Or, I might have told him where to put that chicken...", "NTA.    He could have done better? Tell him to go for it. \n\nThe one time my husband criticized  my cooking he had to make his own dinner for a week. \n\nNever had a problem for tge next 35 years.\nBut if I asked his opinion  on a new dish, I was ok if he said it wasn't  to his taste  . Other times he would say it was a keeper and make it again", "NTA. That was rude as all hell what he did. You are not bat shit crazy for being upset at being talked to like that.", "Does he normally act like a complete jerk and then follow you around browbeating you until you agree he wasn\u2019t a jerk? Because damn, what a jerk.", "ESH. If it were in front of others, sure. But if it's between you two and he thinks he has a better way, tell him he can make it his way next time and you can be the judge of whether it tastes better or not. As it bothered you, a simple \"by the way, it bothered me when you criticized my cooking after having spent xyz time on it, I was proud of what I did and now I feel deflated. Maybe next time let me know your recommendation a day or so later\". But like to get upset? Make a big deal about it and expect an apology? Nah.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
