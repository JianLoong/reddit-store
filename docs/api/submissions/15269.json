We\u2019re a lot alike, share similar interests, etc. We\u2019re also both very stubborn. I\u2019ve always been okay with her voicing her opinions, challenging me, etc. I don\u2019t want her to blindly respect me. We occasionally have a tiny tiff or whatever, but we always make up rather quickly. \n\nMy husband grew up in a very different household. He never would\u2019ve questioned his mother, even as an adult. They never had any arguments and rather, just kept everything bottled in. It\u2019s been very hard for him to accept that it\u2019s healthy for Sienna to voice her opinions and to not blindly accept our word. Before anyone asks, he has refused therapy and I don\u2019t see him budging on the issue.\n\nMy husband often gets irritated when Sienna and I have a disagreement, telling us both to stop, he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, etc. I\u2019ve told him before this is healthy communication. Sienna doesn\u2019t speak to him that way out of respect, knowing he doesn\u2019t want to have that kind of dynamic. So, it shouldn\u2019t matter if she does it with me. Again, we\u2019ve had several discussions with him about respecting our relationship and how it works. Also keep in mind, Sienna and I are not arguing heavily every day, we may just have a minor disagreement or we\u2019ll roll our eyes at one another, joke around, etc a few times a week.\n\nLast night, we sat down for dinner. Sienna was in a bit of a mood as she had a bad day at school. She had already told me she didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so I was respecting her. She ended up getting a little snappy when I asked her if she wanted to do something. I just told her there were better ways of answering that and she rolled her eyes. I was ready to let it go, when my husband jumped in and told Sienna to go to her room for \u201cbeing disrespectful\u201d. She said she\u2019s an adult and he said she lives rent free in his house, she needs to  listen. I told him that I didn\u2019t mind and he said that he didn\u2019t want to hear this attitude.\n\nI asked him to leave the table with me and we went in the other room. I once again pointed out that I didn\u2019t mind Sienna being a little short with me, as I get why. I also said I know she and I will discuss it later and she\u2019ll apologize, we all have bad days. He said he\u2019s tired of hearing us squabble and her talk to me like this. I said I\u2019m tired of him trying to control my relationship with her. By his own admission, Sienna won\u2019t talk to him that way, so why does it matter. I said Sienna wasn\u2019t going to her room unless she wanted to, end of discussion. In the end, my husband went up to our room.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since and things are a little tense.

The days of being sent to her room are long over.

I don\u2019t fault him for wanting a meal without the other parties sniping back and forth and eye rolling.\n\nYour daughter was disrespectful even if you weren\u2019t bothered by her behavior. She can decline without toddler actions.", "YTA no one wants to listen to people constantly bickering, it's stressful and exhausting. You're raising a very rude person", "YTA. My parents also always had little \"disagreements\" and it was annoying to listen to. I bet he's annoyed at both of you because you most definitely do it more than you say you do.", "YTA\n\nI respect that you have created a relationship in which your daughter feels comfortable with disagreeing with you. That is healthy and many parents could learn from this. It isn't a positive trait to unquestioningly follow orders like a soldier. You want to raise a leader, not a follower. \n\nHOWEVER, I think you have strayed a bit too far into this, and have ended up with essentially teaching her that being outright rude to other people is seen as acceptable.\n\nLet's go over the specifics shall we? \n\n1.) She is snappy with you, your response is very measured and shows her there is no consequences for treating other people poorly\n\n2.) She rolls her eyes at your very patient response, again showing you that she thinks it is acceptable to be outright rude to others\n\n3.) Your husband steps in and gets upset, because your daughter is literally just being rude at this point, she's old enough to behave with more kindness. She's 22 not 16. \n\n4.) Instead of taking your daughter aside and having a talk with her, you instead take your husband aside and have a talk with him, this shows your daughter that there are no repercussions for being rude to others, and that you are ready to defend her rudeness to the point of starting a small fight with your partner instead\n\nI think you are far too committed to this \"allowing her to be outright rude\" schtick. She will need to learn at some point that treating others with kindness is expected in day to day life, and that she can't just act like a brat whenever she wants and there will be no consequences. \n\nI've already said this, but she's too old to act like this. And if she doesn't want to be disciplined like a kid, she should be paying her way like a full adult does. That means contributing equally with rent, and with chores.", "ESH \n\nYou bickering constantly is creating a hostile environment. It's good you taught your daughter not to be a doormat, but the way you talk, she didn't grow up having been taught to respect people; your husband has been uncomfortable with this dynamic for a while, and if you wanna have that dynamic, fine, but do it away from him. Stop putting on a show in front of him \n\nObviously he's an asshole for sending an adult to her room, and frankly if he has an issue with her being there rent free, there ought to have been a discussion about it 4 years ago.", "ESH- you totally missed what your husband said though.  He is tired of hearing you two bicker. You might think its not that often but his reaction shows it is more then that.\n\nAs an adult, if I know I'm in a bad mood, I stay away from people so I'm not inflicting it on them.  Your daughter needs to do the same, if she can't sit at the table and be polite others, she needs to not be there.  She could eat in her room or in the kitchen. She could also have said sorry right away, we KNOW when we are in bad moods.  You are allowing her to not act like an adult.", "This seemingly isn\u2019t about the him and daughter dynamic vs. you and daughter dynamic. This is about the household dynamic. \n\nYou seem to ignore that the constant squabbling seems to be driving your husband a bit batty. You say it isnt, and then instantly qualify it as multiple times a week\u2026. Guess what, it **is**.  You completely ignored his feedback. **Completely.** He came out and said \u201ctelling us both to stop, he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, etc.\u201d and you downplay it here in this post as I\u2019m quite certain you did in life.\n\nYTA. If you paid half as much attention to your relationship with your husband as you seem to with your daughter, you\u2019d already know that.", "ESH. 1 I think your husband could benefit from some trauma work therapy he is obviously very triggered by your daughter disrespecting you and I'd bet it's because he knows what would happen to him if he dared do that with his parents. He needs to deal with his childhood. But I do feel he has a valid point you and your daughter are probably taking jabs at each other much more often than you think if it's come to a point where he's saying something. \n\n2 your daughter is being downright rude. She isn't a child anymore she is a grown woman and still behaves like a petulant child and it is unacceptable. She doesn't value that you are so tolerant with her she is deliberately exploiting your patience. She doesn't do that with others because she knows it's wrong. She does with you not because you are her safe place but because she can take her day out on you and you'll reason your way through to excuse her poor behavior. She doesn't respect you. \n\n3 there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to treat your young adult child as just that a young adult and having patience we all have bad days and need extra grace during those frustrating times. You seem to have gone beyond that though and have created a dynamic where you are her door mat. She is too old for this and will probably just always walk over you if you don't make some real changes. \n\nI can tell you love your child very much and would go to great lengths for her happiness and that is commendable but I think you are allowing your own self to be shut down, be disrespected and write it off because maybe you have your own confidence issues? I hope the best for you and your family but I do feel like the time has more than come to establish manners. A bad day doesn't mean you can shit on everyone around you. We all have those moments when we were a little short with people due to our own issues that day but you still have to apologize for that later.", "ESH No one wants to listen to the Bickerson's, it's annoying. You and your daughter may not perceive how your \"little disagreements\" impact the people around you. I think the two of you need to respect not everyone, including your husband, wants to witness your \"little spats\".", "You actually believe that listening to folks' as they squabble has zero effect on the listener. If this is a regular communication mode for you and your daughter, you've been draining your husband's energy for a very long time. It matters. \n\nYTA.", "YTA, I agree with your husband. Rolling eyes, getting snappy just cause you had  a bad day. She not paying rent. I would not want to hear that crap either", "YTA. Your husband is correct - if Sienna wants to be treated as an adult, she shouldn\u2019t act like a child.", "I'm going with NTA- my mother, father and I all have a similar relationship where we have lively discussions, different opinions etc. My brother on the other hand finds this extremely anxiety inducing and if we start to have \"overtly political discussions\" (as my brother puts it), he just leaves the room so he doesn't have to listen. If your husband doesn't like it then he should leave the room. He can't be dictating how two adult women who have a close relationship interact with one another", "NTA. Regardless of whether she pays rent, Sienna is a tenant and an adult. Your husband needs to learn that \"respect\" isn't only due to those in positions of authority, and is deserved by everyone. Even Sienna, and even when she's having a bad day.", "Try looking at it from his perspective. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been stewing over these exchanges for sometime now and it bothers him even if it doesn\u2019t bother you. That\u2019s a problem and if you think telling him to suck it up is the answer, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re wrong. Your daughter should respect him by being polite to you, even if it doesn\u2019t matter to you. Also Having a bad day is not an excuse for mistreating other people. Nobody has the right to be unkind YTA.", "YTA. Its ok to have bad days. But that doesnt give you license to be rude to others. My soon to be 6 year old understands this. Your daughter was outright rude and disrespectful. If she couldnt have civil interactions then she needs to remove herself. Its good to be able to disagree with parents and children, but people need to learn to disagree without being disrespectful and rude", "YTA. Sounds like you've made excuses for your daughter being a certain way and now she's an adult, treats you however she feels. I feel bad for your husband and it sounds as if he has tried to parent her and stop that behavior and you didn't let him. I'd be pissed if my kids talked to their mother a certain way in front of me too.", "YTA - This doesn\u2019t sound like you have a healthy dynamic with Sienna at all. She speaks to you rudely, rolling her eyes and being disrespectful - do you think you are doing her any favours in letting her think that acting like that in life is acceptable? \n\nI am not surprised your husband is unhappy. He does not want to see his daughter of all people be horrible to his wife, and treat her badly. He is also probably tired of the constant bickering which he can\u2019t escape. You ignore his feelings on the matter and you both aren\u2019t listening when he asks you both to stop. \n\nYour daughter is 22, she should be better than a stroppy teenager by now.", "ESH sounds like your husband is probably just tired of a 22 yo living there rent free still acting like a 16 yo... I think he has a right to be at the end of his rope listening to you both bicker.", "NTA. The idea of sending an adult to her room is ridiculous, whether she pays rent or not.", "It's hard watching someone you love get disrespected. There are things that I can take but once someone comes for my man, I'm ready to fight. It just eats at me. There is nothing that bothers me more. \n\n\nYou asked a question,  she snapped, you politely corrected, she rolled her eyes. I get that you have your own parenting style but I wouldn't even like to see this happen to a friend and I think that you deserve better. You are a lot more lenient than her father and I think that she's taking advantage.  \n\n>She ended up getting a little snappy when I asked her if she wanted to do something. I just told her there were better ways of answering that and she rolled her eyes.\n\n\nHe is telling you his concern here. Nobody wants to watch people go back and forth. People want to eat. What is your response going to be? Maybe don't act like that at the table. You know she's capable of being respectful (she is to her father). Maybe make the table a no squabble zone. \n\n>He said he\u2019s tired of hearing us squabble and her talk to me like this.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Maybe one day your daughter is going to leave and have a family of her own. The last thing you want is for her to leave and your marriage is in shambles because you could not compromise now. Also you always present a united front unless it's an exceptional circumstance.  \n\n\nI'm gonna go with ESH-\n\n-You shouldn't be going back and forth with your daughter at the table(nobody wants to deal with that while eating)-\nI'm not sure that you see his side -\nHe maybe should not have tried to send her to her room-\nYou should have presented a united front with your husband-\nYou guys should have figured this out before getting married and having kids-\nYall need to compromise because obviously this isn't working. \n\n\n\n\n*For reference I am the same age as your daughter.*", "Yta.

You discuss it later, but presenting a unified front to your children is important, even adult children.  Edit: Don't squabble in front of him.  I knew better than to do that in front of my father. No one likes to hear their spouse being disrespected. If an order is given like you to your room, you better get stepping, no matter which parent gives the order.", "NTA.\n\nMy mom and I have the same relationship as you and Sienna have. When my grandmother (her mom) was still alive she hated our relationship. I've told my mom to shut up, quit being a b****, an as*, etc. My grandma always said 'you shouldn't talk to your mom like that'. My response 'If you don't like it, talk to your daughter. She raised me to talk to her like this, it's how I was raised'. \n\nI respect my mom immensely. She and my brother live with me. I take care of her and she takes care of him.

I\u2019m close in age with your daughter and I have a similar dynamic with my parents. She may come to resent your husband, so just prepare for that.

Your husband needs to be careful about demanding respect because one day when she moves out, she may not want to have a relationship with him.", "NTA - Your daughter is not a child anymore. Getting snappy in a bad mood is not great. But he made way too much of a deal out of it.", "No vote. This is one of those: do you want to be right, or do you want to lose your marriage?\n\nYou just basically sent your husband to his room.\n\nHe's been asking you to stop this for years.

It didn't sound like anyone pushed hard enough to warrant being an ah.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'd imagine you'll have the closer relationship with your daughter when she moves out than your husband will since you let your guard down with each other now.", "My opinion on YTA.  \n\nI'm confused on why you're teaching you daughter being rude and being a jerk is ok. If she talks and roll her eyes at her own mother dont you think she'll do it to other people too. \n\nAlso if you do this multiple times a week, I get his frustration when every other day he has to hear/watch the 2 women in his life argue", "NTA me and my dad are the same and my mom is like your husband but she leaves if we're arguing and we avoid arguing at the table but if we did she would remind us", "If your child wants to act like a child, they should be treated as such.

But you and your daughter are adults and should have your disagreements away from the dinner table. Your husband should treat you like the adults you are and request that you resolve your conflicts elsewhere.", "YTA, or a doormat.  Your child should show respect for you.  You provided her with life, a home, probably an education, and at the end of the day it sounds like you are a pretty reasonable mother, so the only reason why she disrespects you, and your husband by proxy, is because you have allowed it.", "ESH\n\nDad because his daughter isn\u2019t his little girl any more to order around for being impertinent.\n\nDaughter because as an adult in the house she can control her attitude enough to not stink up the general atmosphere in the public spaces.  If she wants to be in a pissy mood, she should do it in private, not take it out on the rest of the residents.\n\nYou for condoning it.  You are doing the equivalent of telling your daughter to go right ahead and fart in a crowded elevator.  Considering that Dad pays for the space while Daughter does not, his right to quiet enjoyment of the premises is greater than her right to let it all hang out.  (Even if \u201cgo to your room young lady\u201d is a cringe way to express it.). That much is true even when everyone is paying equal shares; the unpleasant roommate eventually doesn\u2019t get asked to renew the lease.  When the unpleasant roommate is also freeloading, they wear out their welcome that much sooner.", "NTA. You and your daughter have a dynamic which works for both of you. Your husband should respect that.  You handled your conversation with your husband well by asking to speak with him in private. I would point out that you seems to think that as long as Sienna does not talk back with your husband, it does not affect him. You are wrong, by having these \u201ctiffs\u201d in front of him you undermine his perception of the family relationship. It does not mean you need to adjust your dynamic with your daughter to fit into his perception, just need to be aware that it does effect him", "NTA, it\u2019s not disrespectful to disagree with a parent or have a bad day. The fact that you know she will apologize later and that she feels comfortable enough with you to express emotion says a lot about your parenting.", "NTA", "NTA, he sounds like one of those people who demands he be \u201crespected\u201d but really he just means \u201cyou need to acknowledge my authority over you\u201d. Sooo many from the older generation like this have blurred the lines between respect and authority. It\u2019s only respect when you\u2019re straying from what they want, the second you get them to try to respect you back is when the problems come up.", "Was your husband abused as a child. He seems to have clear issues that need to be addressed in therapy and a deep-seated need to be a bully?", "Nta \n\nYou are aware all his parenting style will do is push her away right? \n\nOne day she won't be living rent free in your house. And the only time you will get to see her is when she also wants to see you both.\n\nI see a very real possibility of a future where you are the only one with a relationship with your daughter. If your husband doesn't want to lose his only child I suggest he take a hard reality check on his controlling behaviour.", "NTA- You would be in the wrong if your dynamic with her challenged his authority, but you said she doesn't act that way with him out of respect. I personally think that you raised a daughter who feels comfortable sharing her emotions with you without any restraint. Every kid has wanted to roll their eyes at their parents, you just so happen to be the parent that allows that emotion to be showed openly instead of behind your back. \n\nI can understand how this would be frustrating for your husband though. I would say N A H but I feel that would be hypocritical. If you do not force your parenting style on him then he shouldn't force it on you. It seems that your daughter is good with acting accordingly to which parent she's speaking with. If she would have been sent to her room, it would be your husband undermining your parenting because you had already resolved the situation your way and was fine with it being over with. He stepped in and took over when the situation did not involve him. He's in the wrong. He can't expect you to change your parenting style when he doesn't even want to change his.", "NTA - maybe if husband was requesting your daughter say, apologize for the attitude or something itd be fine, but trying to tell a grown adult to go to their room is absolutely ridiculous. Its also just a lazy way to a way actually addressing and discussing the issues.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is way out of line. The important thing is that you are alright with the dynamic you have with Sienna. If he doesn\u2019t want her to live rent free at your (not just his!) house then he should kick her out. Sending an adult to her room is not an option. I\u2019m glad you held firm on your opinion there. \n\nI also just want to point out that your husband referring to it as his house if it\u2019s the family home he shares with you is a major red flag. His control issues are a little worrying.", "NAH I think your relationship with her sounds lovely - and that is what you prefer and how you raised her. You are probably her safe person. Kind of reminds me of Lorelei and Rory from Gilmore Girls lol. \n\nI know people are saying it annoys him and he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, and that\u2019s fair. But this is your dynamic and it\u2019s your choice how to respond to how she communicates with you. *Especially* given her age - he sounds like a boomer with his \u2018not under my roof\u2019 silliness. He personally gets the \u2018respect\u2019 he desires from his child with no problem. Not his monkey, not his circus.", "My dad is the same way! I have an incredibly expressive face and voice and tend to unintentionally exaggerate certain reactions. I got in a lot of trouble for disrespect and attitude. Jokes on him tho cuz my attitude never went away and I just stopped caring what he thought XD", "NAH. \n\nYour husband sounds a lot like mine. I had to work with him to understand you WANT your kids to argue and push back, that it's okay. He was raised very \"kids are seen but not heard\" so it was a whole mentality change for him, and add a dash of \"respect your mother above all others\" and it was ugly. \n\nIt was definitely a learning experience for him. He still doesn't like it when my son calls and cusses too much on the phone (I absolutely assure you, he learned it from me, but his dad still doesn't like it lol).", "NTA \nMy twins are 14 and we communicate very similarly. There\u2019s a lot of teasing, definitely eye rolls, there\u2019s a distinction between things I require them to do, things I ask them to do and things I recommend they do. \n\nPeople raised in more authoritarian style households find it disrespectful when my kids don\u2019t do everything I ask but we discussed it\u2019s not asking if \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t an option. We negotiate some things related to cleaning/sleeping because I want them to learn how to manage their time, regulate their sleep patterns. They have chores for the family areas that they do without complaint but when it comes to their rooms they get more flexibility.\n\nI leave them alone about homework but check occasionally to see how they\u2019re doing, but they get their work done independently. \n\nThey\u2019re both good students, can cook full meals, do laundry, put together a bookshelf and handle conflict relatively well. \n\nGiving them freedom but being available to help and set boundaries when necessary will hopefully make the transition to adulthood easier for them.", "NTA at all. At 22, he has zero authority to send her to her room. He needs to back off and get some help. Adults will have disagreements - it happens.", "NTA. Your husband is, in a word, being ridiculous. For the most part. \n\nThe only thing I would back him on is that it can get annoying listening to two other family members squabble. Then he should ask you politely to stop it, or take it into another room or whatever. And out of politeness you should. But his reaction was totally off the rails. Stick to your guns. He needs to A) understand that his daughter is an adult. B) That he has no place in your argument. And C) that he has some anger control issues that may need addressing.", "I had the same relationship with my parents as Sienna does to you two.  My dad would jump my ass if he thought I was disrespecting mom.  I resented him for it for decades.  I am realizing (a TINY bit) that he was trying to protect my mom from my teenage angsty self.  These days, I married a man who is similar to my dad (I know.)  He's a Brit and I am American.  I had two kids from a previous marriage, and we (my kids and I) have very open communication and somewhat similar sense of humor.  My hubby is a bit more...well, British LOL so sometimes when my kids (especially my son) make inappropriate jokes or mouths off to me, I have my way of handling that is more non-confrontational, because obviously they are in some kinda mood that I don't know about yet.  My husband jumps to anger immediately and I have to play middle man to de-escalate the situation.  It really is tiresome.  I totally get you OP.  NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. As long as you're ok with the dynamic you have with your daughter then he has no right to say anything about it.", "He no longer feels he is king of the castle. The queen and princess rebelled against royal authority. NTA. He should talk to her not order her. She is just too old for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We\u2019re a lot alike, share similar interests, etc. We\u2019re also both very stubborn. I\u2019ve always been okay with her voicing her opinions, challenging me, etc. I don\u2019t want her to blindly respect me. We occasionally have a tiny tiff or whatever, but we always make up rather quickly. \n\nMy husband grew up in a very different household. He never would\u2019ve questioned his mother, even as an adult. They never had any arguments and rather, just kept everything bottled in. It\u2019s been very hard for him to accept that it\u2019s healthy for Sienna to voice her opinions and to not blindly accept our word. Before anyone asks, he has refused therapy and I don\u2019t see him budging on the issue.\n\nMy husband often gets irritated when Sienna and I have a disagreement, telling us both to stop, he doesn\u2019t want to hear it, etc. I\u2019ve told him before this is healthy communication. Sienna doesn\u2019t speak to him that way out of respect, knowing he doesn\u2019t want to have that kind of dynamic. So, it shouldn\u2019t matter if she does it with me. Again, we\u2019ve had several discussions with him about respecting our relationship and how it works. Also keep in mind, Sienna and I are not arguing heavily every day, we may just have a minor disagreement or we\u2019ll roll our eyes at one another, joke around, etc a few times a week.\n\nLast night, we sat down for dinner. Sienna was in a bit of a mood as she had a bad day at school. She had already told me she didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so I was respecting her. She ended up getting a little snappy when I asked her if she wanted to do something. I just told her there were better ways of answering that and she rolled her eyes. I was ready to let it go, when my husband jumped in and told Sienna to go to her room for \u201cbeing disrespectful\u201d. She said she\u2019s an adult and he said she lives rent free in his house, she needs to  listen. I told him that I didn\u2019t mind and he said that he didn\u2019t want to hear this attitude.\n\nI asked him to leave the table with me and we went in the other room. I once again pointed out that I didn\u2019t mind Sienna being a little short with me, as I get why. I also said I know she and I will discuss it later and she\u2019ll apologize, we all have bad days. He said he\u2019s tired of hearing us squabble and her talk to me like this. I said I\u2019m tired of him trying to control my relationship with her. By his own admission, Sienna won\u2019t talk to him that way, so why does it matter. I said Sienna wasn\u2019t going to her room unless she wanted to, end of discussion. In the end, my husband went up to our room.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since and things are a little tense. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter is indeed disrespecting you and has been for the longest time. Your husband talked to her like a child because she IS acting like a child. Her attitude towards you was uncalled for.

It feels like this is affecting him negatively, maybe because he's not part of the inner circle? Could it also be that he is feeling left out?", "There is no ESH.

I mean its not much of a wonder the father and daughter arent open with each other compared to mother and daughter.", "In that case the dad, as a listener, should maybe actually find ways to communicate his frustration on how their dynamic currently operates. Maybe work with the two of them on gravitating towards a dynamic all three of them are ok with. \n\nA great way of reaching such a conclusion would be through the means of something like therapy. Which dad has refused. \n\nInstead he chooses to not address it whats so ever. To just shut it all down by means of banishing daughter to her room", "Where exactly does she say \u201cshe didnt have to listen to father\u201d im confused.", "Na, not confusing them at all. No one from my family speaks to each other like that, or if they do it\u2019s a big deal. \n\nSounds like you just come from rude families. And I agree, the wife desperately needs better communication skills. Completely ignored what her husband was trying to say. I feel bad for him. \n\nAnd plenty of mothers and daughters are close without having this toxic teenage dynamic. And even if they decide they want to keep that method of interaction as \u201ctheir thing\u201d and realize the rest of the world isn\u2019t like that, they should respect that their bickering is exhausting. There\u2019s three people eating dinner at that table, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s pretty sick of the multiple decades of bickering. It\u2019s one thing to deal with sass from a 14 year old. A 22 y/o living rent free? Fuck no.", "Right... that dad graduated to belligerently telling daughter to go to her room with absolutely no preamble, which isn't reasonable at all. OP notes this is a long-recurring issue, and he's voiced his concerns more than once.\n\nAnd he's either been ignored or shut down. His wife dismisses him as needing therapy and refuses to work to change the dynamic to one that might suit all three of them. \n\nYou're looking for him to do all of the work of accommodating crap communications: I want some evidence that OP is doing any of that work herself, because it sure as hell doesn't show in her communication with her husband. \n\nHe's not the one failing to address the issue here.", ". I said Sienna wasn\u2019t going to her room unless she wanted to, end of discussion. In the end, my husband went up to our room.", "My mother and I didn't bicker in front of my father, because he didn't like it. that's a respect thing they seem to be lacking. I also feel sorry for dad.", "Very much you are. Yes.\n\nSounds like your family simply refuses confrontation until it blows up into a mess that becomes a big deal. A little open expressivness goes a long way to avoid those, big deal, situation. Of course thats just my assumption that im making now that we are playing the family assumption game. \n\nShe ignored her husband because he was hilariously ridiculous in his approach on the issue. A person shouldnt blindly adhere to their partners stance, opinion, or approach on something when it is as stupid as his was. \n\nMaybe reread the situation and youll realize they handled the issue well until dad stepped in and THAT is when the bickering happened.  Two of them, mother and daughter, came across some tension due to a bad day. They chose to deescalate and drop it for the time being since they were at the dinner table. Mom even says theyd be addressing it personally later. However, dad decides to escalate the situation with his ridiculous command.", "Yeah. Because telling a 22 year old to go to her room is laughably stupid. \n\nAlso a bad example for daughters future relationship is more so the father given that he is so emotionally closed off that he cant even have a proper discussion over an issue, refuses therapy despite seemingly needing it, and choosing to ignore issues opposed to addressing them.", "For a lot of people, constant conflict is exhausting. If it\u2019s occasional or merited, that\u2019s one thing, but this is clearly something that happens regularly. \n\nPeople that have this dynamic often forget how negatively it affects others.", "Disagreed. She was being a brat and ruining his dinner. It\u2019s basic respect to not ruin other people\u2019s meal because you had a bad day. If she\u2019s going to act 12, sending her to her room is totally reasonable. \n\nThey know dad hates the constant bickering and have chosen to be rude and ignore it. OP is clearly part of the problem. \n\nAnd as far as my family, we are capable of talking through conflict like adults. It worries me that your definition of \u201copen expressiveness\u201d between two adults is eye rolling and bickering. That\u2019s not how I teach my kids to communicate when they are frustrated, as it helps no one. \n\nI reread the situation. OP and daughter are both TA.", "She's 22. Nothing is gong to change."]}
