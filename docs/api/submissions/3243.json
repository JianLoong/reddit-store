It was a 4.5 hour flight and I was alone with my 4 yo and 22 mo. The toddler is a rowdy guy. He\u2019s hard to handle in pretty much any circumstance, let alone on an airplane. \n\nI was playing Miss Rachel for the toddler on the flight. I adjust the volume so that\u2019s it was audible over the noise of the plane. It didn\u2019t seem overly loud to me. I\u2019ve tried headphones, but it\u2019s a no go, he just pulls them off. \n\nWe had the row to ourselves, and the flight wasn\u2019t very full, only 1 guy directly in front of us. I peeked at him and he had headphones on, so I wasn\u2019t worried about disturbing anyone. \n\nAfter 15 mins, he turned around, clearly annoyed and asked if my 1 year old could wear headphones. When he turned I saw that he only had one earbud in, not both. I told him no, he won\u2019t keep them on and I\u2019ll try to lower the volume. I did but my toddler then lost interest because he couldn\u2019t hear it, so I turned it back up. Judge mental looks ensued but I just ignored him for the rest of the flight. I mean, miss Rachel is better than a screaming kid, right? \n\nWhat do people think about playing audio over speakers on flights for young kids? AITA? I just feel like with today\u2019s noise cancelling tech, if you want quiet on an airplane, it\u2019s easier for you as an adult to wear headphones than control what others are doing.", "created_utc": 1669425527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4u3zx/aita_for_playing_cartoons_on_an_airplane/", "score": 276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, two issues hit me:\n\n1. At the end of this post, you try to suggest that it's the job of *every single person* on a plane to create personal quiet. Bullshit. Would you say that if some dude were watching a show and your kid wanted to sleep? Hell no. You'd be complaining that this guy was being rude.\n2. Do this, but if someone complains, stop. Play it on mute. Most kids as young as yours don't really care that much. But even if he does, suck it up. \n\nSo, in general, YTA. Your culminating attitude is simply wrong, and it is on its basis that you are asserting that you're in the right here. You're not.", "So because your kid refuses to wear headphones everyone else is supposed to? YTA.

And so is every other person who subjects other people to their audio in public spaces. \n\nYes, crying kids suck for everyone on a plane. Or anywhere really. There are plenty of quieter ways to entertain small children on planes. FFS. \n\nThis is also about teaching your kids to be considerate towards others.", "YTA. I hate it when parents make their problems other peoples problems.", "YTA!  I\u2019m surprised the flight attendant didn\u2019t ask you to turn the volume off completely.  You can\u2019t control a lot of how a baby/toddler acts but you can control the volume and it should never be louder than the plane noise.  Either the toddler wears child headphones or watches with volume off.", "Just curious ... why do you keep referring to the 22 month old child as a 1 year old.\n\nThere's a big difference between a 1 year old/12 month old and a 22 month old (almost 2 year old). He's likely been a rowdy toddler for a while and you should have been working on getting him used to headphones and other \"plane voices & rules\" activities.\n\nYTA. Not acceptable to put the burden on others to wear noise cancelling headphones to drown out your choice of irritating videos for toddlers.", "YTA.

People like you are why people like me who have to fly a lot say little prayers in the waiting area when we see a kid that we won\u2019t be seated anywhere near them when we board. I shouldn\u2019t have to buy expensive noise canceling headphones so you can play your kid cartoons without headphones. Or so an adult can watch a movie on their phone without headphones. Or so people can sing their favorite tune because they\u2019re nervous fliers. \n\nMany of my friends and some of my family have to fly with little kids due to military moves and such and they manage to teach their kids appropriate behavior\u2014like tolerating headphones\u2014before they fly. It\u2019s not your kid\u2019s fault you didn\u2019t prepare but your fellow seat mates shouldn\u2019t have to listen to cartoons\n\n\nMan, the entitlement.", "YTA.

Nobody wants to hear your kid\u2019s cartoons.  If the alternative is screaming, then I guess you need to skip the trip this year.", "YTA\n\nI like kids, and I am sympathetic to noisy babies.

A few silent toys, a cheap magnetic drawing tablet thing, *lots* of books, lots of snacks, lots more books. Sure - perhaps the row behind us could also have recited *The Gruffalo* from memory by the end of the flight, but cartoons are deliberately made to be intrusive and attract the attention aurally, which is what makes them so obnoxious as \"background\" noise.\n\nThat might have been the trip that we brought the water-sensitive paper for the kid to do finger \"painting\" with.", "Yes, YTA. No one wants to hear you trying to entertain your kid. Either headphones or find something quiet. It's as annoying as blaring videos on your phone in public.", "Yes, you are absolutly the ah.

There is no need for anybody on the plane to have to listen to your child's cartoons.

It was quiet, we were quiet, and there was peace. You could quietly entertain your toddler and not require screens to do it for you, or you could teach your kid to keep the headphones on. What you cannot do is loudly play cartoons without headphone because YTA, big time. Or, you can book a private jet, a train sleeper car, or drive your own self and be as loud as you want.", "YTA I had to listen to a child\u2019s video from Atlanta to Amsterdam. 8-9 hours.

Playing audio out loud in public transit is a no-no for any reason. I would be okay with it if you were sitting next to me because I have my own kids and I\u2019ve been there. However, you can\u2019t just assume that from everyone.\n\nPrior to your next trip, head to the store and try to find some comfy over the ear headphones or a similar style that would work for your little one. With so many varieties to choose from there has to be something they will keep on their head. Practice at home prior to the trip so the airplane isn\u2019t the first time they use their A/V set up. They won\u2019t keep headphones on doesn\u2019t means nothing will ever work. It just means you haven\u2019t found the right setup and haven\u2019t practiced with it enough for that child.", "YTA. \n\nI understand that you were trying to keep your four year-old occupied but at four, you should be able yo say, \u201cHey, kiddo, if you want to watch your show, you MUST wear headphones.

It is distracting and annoying to everyone else in the area.  This is why people wish for childfree flights.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s easier for you as an adult to control your child and not expect everyone to adjust their lives for you.\n\nThat aside, it\u2019s rude to play audio in public without headphones.

I came on here seriously wondering why someone would be offended you were playing cartoons... but this should actually be titled \"AITA for playing audio out loud on an airplane and then ignoring a request to turn it off\".\n\nLook, I get that it's frustrating having a child and having to travel, but you are entertaining your child at the expense of the bystanders around you.  I don't have a good option, but you know your baby is hyper... so yes, you are TA, but you'd be a bigger AH if you keep getting defensive and don't figure out a better way to travel without having to play the audio out loud... there have to be some forums that have great advice.", "YTA.. making other people listen to what you are watching is rude no matter if it's  an adult or a child.

You probably do it on restaurants too .", "Yta.", "YTA and so entitled. What, just because you have a kid it means you can disrupt everyone else's peace and quiet? Parents like you are the absolute worst.", "YTA.  Here's the thing, I have been on many many flights with many many little children and not once have I seen a parent show their child a show with the audio on for others to hear.

Find another way to entertain your kid, maybe get him used to headphones while at home. I know it\u2019s hard, when my kids were young we used to travel a lot so I get it. And for the record, those with kids have every right to fly just as much as those who do not. It\u2019s just that those who have young children bear the responsibility of doing our best to make sure our kids don\u2019t ruin the flight for those around them.", "YTA.

It isn't as hard to fly with kids as people make it out to be. Come prepared, be ready to interact with them, and let them know what to expect and what is expected from them. The only time I ever had an issue was with my 5 month old when her ears were popping. She was crying and  the flight attendant got mad at me.

I can imagine how difficult it can be to control a toddler without resulting in a crying child. Kids are not machines you can\u2019t switch them off when they are uncomfortable. Also the pressure in airplanes often causes ear pain which is why babies and toddlers often cry.

It was a 4.5 hour flight and I was alone with my 4 yo and 22 mo. The toddler is a rowdy guy. He\u2019s hard to handle in pretty much any circumstance, let alone on an airplane. \n\nI was playing Miss Rachel for the toddler on the flight. I adjust the volume so that\u2019s it was audible over the noise of the plane. It didn\u2019t seem overly loud to me. I\u2019ve tried headphones, but it\u2019s a no go, he just pulls them off. \n\nWe had the row to ourselves, and the flight wasn\u2019t very full, only 1 guy directly in front of us. I peeked at him and he had headphones on, so I wasn\u2019t worried about disturbing anyone. \n\nAfter 15 mins, he turned around, clearly annoyed and asked if my 1 year old could wear headphones. When he turned I saw that he only had one earbud in, not both. I told him no, he won\u2019t keep them on and I\u2019ll try to lower the volume. I did but my toddler then lost interest because he couldn\u2019t hear it, so I turned it back up. Judge mental looks ensued but I just ignored him for the rest of the flight. I mean, miss Rachel is better than a screaming kid, right? \n\nWhat do people think about playing audio over speakers on flights for young kids? AITA? I just feel like with today\u2019s noise cancelling tech, if you want quiet on an airplane, it\u2019s easier for you as an adult to wear headphones than control what others are doing.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Soft YTA, I'm sorry. It's unfair of you to put the onus on other people to wear headphones. You shouldn't be creating the noise that necessitates them. (Some people, myself included, can't wear in-ear headphones, and over-ear noise-cancelling headphones can be expensive and uncomfortable.) I get it, you want to keep your child entertained, but that means it was on you to find a real solution before your flight, one that did not cause a nuisance for others, and did not leave your child bored and screaming.\n\nI recently flew from Los Angeles to Heathrow and the cabin crew told everyone on board that your options were headphones or subtitles, regardless of age. No playing of films or cartoons out loud would be tolerated. It was a lovely quiet plane and most people were able to doze off within an hour.\n\nI hope you're able to find a better solution in the future!", "YTA.", "I'm a mom of 2. Soft YTA. This is kind of like insisting on reclining your chair the whole way when there's a very tall person sitting behind you on a crowded flight.\n\nYou're allowed to use the plane and your kids should not have to skip Thanksgiving - especially when they are young, most likely this is a rare opportunity for them to spend time with extended family. In fact, the FAA allows lap infants specifically because they want to encourage families to fly vs. drive, because it's much safer.\n\nBut. I completely agree with all of the other comments - train your kid to wear headphones (you can get cute ones that look like animal ears etc), bring tons of snacks, bring coloring books. It *IS* annoying to sit near an audible children's program.\n\nI think a lot of these other commenters don't respect the challenges of flying with young kids, but you also come across as pretty entitled. At least give extra apologies or offer to buy the dude some snacks or a drink to make up for it.", "YTA.

That sounds like hell", "YTA.", "Soft YTA. I promise you, OP- I get the struggle of trying to figure out the lesser of the evils when dealing with a young child. That said, this is the kind of thing that you need to concretely figure out prior to getting on a plane. I can\u2019t emphasize enough to parents the importance of proactive parenting instead of reactive parenting. It sounds like you engaged in reactive parenting - you knew headphones might be a problem, but you didn\u2019t come up with a viable solution. You tried to figure things out on the fly in a high stakes situation where there was no escape if your child melted down, instead of trying to problem solve before go-time, when the stakes were much lower.  \n\nTo be more specific in my feedback: \n\nYou could have practiced with headphones at home leading up to the flight. They have soft headband-style headphones that some kids prefer to traditional types that you could have bought and tried out. If headphones were a no-go, you could have ditched the cartoon plan and tried experimenting with some sort of child-friendly phone games or activities that might engage your child. \n\nI truly remember how difficult flying with young children was. That said, I tried to be as courteous as possible - not everyone wants to wear noise canceling headphones, especially if they want to sleep. This meant utilizing proactive parenting. I had go bags ready with snacks, different toys, activities, etc. I made sure my kids would do headphones and pre-loaded cartoons and movies. I had drawing apps on tablets with fun coloring pages pre-loaded. I had travel-friendly play stations and sensory toys that weren\u2019t loud. I spent months evaluating how long different items occupied my children so that I had enough choices to last the entire flight. \n\nI think you\u2019ll find that people are kinder to you as a parent and that your travel (and general) experiences with your children go much more smoothly if you are significantly more proactive with your parenting.

I think we watched some videos on my phone on mute or had some sensory quiet toys or snacks, but our flights were always like 2hrs max and he often just napped.

But these are tiny humans who are learning. They're learning impulse control and how to be bored (which some adults still struggle with!). They're learning how their behaviour impacts other people. At this age they're super self-centred - not in a bad way, just how our brains develop. It's tricky looking at situations from other people's points of view, empathising and then changing your behaviour with that in mind, when you've only got a few years of the required 25 for full brain development. \n\nAnd some kids are just naturally louder and more active. My kid being one of them. And we've got friends with a kid the same age who likes to just quietly read or brush a doll's hair for ages. My kid likes to read, but he also likes to have big discussions around exactly what is happening in the books and loves hamming it up in response to funny or surprising things that happen. So even reading isn't always a quiet thing \ud83d\ude02 Plus I use ridiculous voices for the characters and add sound effects.

Thats pretty common\n2) It is also possible that he has ear sensitivities like I do. I found wearing headphones to be very uncomfortable and it pains my ears. I often switch back and forth or only wear one at a time. \n3) he may have been a nervous flyer and wanted to be able to hear any announcements \n4) the noise from you and the noise in his ear buds may have been conflicting with each other. That can be really annoying and make it hard to focus on one thing. Taking a ear bud can be a relief \n5) he should only be expected to turn up the volume on his headphones to a safe level. Drowning out the plane and your sounds may have may unsafe for him to keep the ear buds in his ears\n\nEither way, you don't know which is why you cant expect to encroach on his comfort and not expect a negative reaction.

One little package might be 2 chenille stems & 2 tissues to make into a story (the tissues get ripped up & twisted into hats, capes, blankets, traps, whatever for the stick figures & you creat a stupid story where the figures \u201cjump\u201d & \u201cfly\u201d & \u201cget stuck\u201d & rescue each other.)\n\nLater, the little plastic animal in the egg could join the story & become a pet or steal some \u201ctreasure \u201c or the figures could feed it \u201cfood\u201d.\n\nThe next wrapped treat would be something different- 2 crayons &  several 3x5 cards to draw a picture for Grandma or Daddy or whoever. \nThen a wrapped tiny paper cup with a few goldfish.\nThen switch gears and read a couple of books.\n\nYou get the idea. I tried to make each little surprise last 5-10 minutes, and do other stuff in between.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this, Momma!!!", "As a fellow mom, one thing to remember is that we have evolved to tune that shit out. Our brains don\u2019t register children\u2019s programming in the same way they used to because it\u2019s when we have peace. \n\nIt\u2019s not the same for others and it\u2019s important to not lose sight of that.", "And he\u2019s almost 2. BTW. 22 mos is a big difference from 12 mos developmentally.\n\nYes it\u2019s challenging to fly with young children. I\u2019ve done it myself.

Is this your first time on an airplane? Have you ever in your life seen anyone else do this? If this was a common and okay thing, I think you\u2019d have seen it. I fly all the time for work and whenever someone does this the flight attendant makes them stop. You chose to fly with your two kids, I get it\u2019s tough. But no one needs to accommodate you.", "Make sure that you are not subjecting others to your cartoons AND that your child is not kicking the seat or crying.", "Absolutely not.  Entertain your child in a way that doesn\u2019t disrupt me.  I get kids cry but helll no will I listen to some insipid cartoon because it\u2019s easier for you.  That\u2019s my issue.  You\u2019re doing this crap and making excuses for your comfort.  Figure it out.", "With that fantastic attitude I can see why you were appalled at someone being irritated at you. You're comfortable allowing your child to be someone else's issue at all. Your child is 0% anyone else's problem. YTA and do better.", "If you need cartoons to keep your kid your kid from screaming during the entire flight, then maybe you shouldn't fly with them or find some quiet activities to keep them occupied.", "For other things, we have recourse if someone\u2019s making unreasonable noise during sleeping hours", "And children also don't whine and cry just because they're bored apparently lol", "Yup, clearly they shouldn\u2019t go to the store, or preschool, or the doctors\u2026.. I mean boy, all that screaming, must be just to annoy those around them right?", "They meant sympathetic smart ass", "Young children need more than a single option. You wouldn\u2019t expect them to do the one thing for 4 or 5 hours at home, so why do you think it would work when they\u2019re in an uncomfortable, loud, unfamiliar environment?\n\nAnd your choice to have only the phone or tablet makes even less sense if you had really tried and failed to get him comfortable with headphones. But it\u2019s also  strange you didn\u2019t mention all that supposed effort in your post so\u2026.", "Missing thanksgiving until the kids are old enough to travel wont be bad either.", "Agree that they absolutely shouldn't be missing the holiday.
