The med care in our area is terrible and we decided to go to Philly to one of the best pancreatic surgeons in the world. I\u2019m currently in a hotel room with his mom (55) while he\u2019s in recovery at the hospital. \n\nFor the last two weeks he\u2019s been told he was going to die. That pancreatic cancer is a death sentence. So the day of the surgery,  this past Friday, after the surgery the surgeon tells his mom and I that it\u2019s a very rare non-cancerous tumor. And he\u2019s pissed at the original doctor in our area who said it was because \u201cany doctor who thought this was cancer is not a good doctor\u201d. \n\nCousin is in absolute pain. The nurses won\u2019t leave him alone. They\u2019re there every five minutes. They\u2019re forcing him to walk. He\u2019s sleep deprived and just down right mean. He\u2019s in such pain he\u2019s delusional. He kicked us out of the room which we are ok with but he thinks we got kicked out of the hospital because we were smoking in his room. \n\nHe\u2019s been texting everyone and calling everyone up (including his 80yo grandmother) either telling them that his mom and I are liars and he has cancer, or calling people and screaming at them about random shit. \n\nSo I went back to the hospital and took his phone. He yelled at me and said he needed it. I told him it wasn\u2019t helping his recovery and he\u2019ll get it back Wednesday on discharge. He was yelling at me even as I walked out the door and calling me the asshole\n\nAm I the asshole? I don\u2019t think I am but I feel terrible nonetheless.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t care about your medical opinions. nurses agree I take his phone. We are all very close. Things he\u2019s done:\nCalled his 80yo grandmother and said she\u2019s a piece of shit human who didn\u2019t care if he lived or died. That she never done anything for him. She helped raise him and even bought him a house. \n\nCalled his mom and screamed at her for not staying with her abusive ex that beat her so bad she was hospitalized for a week and broke my cousins leg \n\nCalled his boss and quit work by calling his boss a cocksucker (not the best time to do that). \n\nAlso stop saying he\u2019s going to take me to court. I just gifted them 20k for this surgery.", "created_utc": 1667855712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp0ngg/aita_for_taking_a_phone_away_from_hospitalized/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was a combination of the illness, the medications, and the trauma that landed him in the hospital.\n\nA few of his delusions at the time included:\n\n1. Believing there was a television on his wall, which he 'watched' regularly, and was hallucinating vivid, unlikely stories\n2. Phoning his dad to tell him that the nurses were trying to poison him\n3. Physically fighting said nurses when they tried to medicate him\n4. Making social media posts about how the entire hospital staff had been fired (??? never understood this one LOL)\n5. Thinking that someone had hacked his email and were using a sex tape of us to blackmail him (no tape existed)\n\nThese were things we actually had a good laugh about together after the crisis was over and he was on the road to recovery.\n\nAfter the first couple of questionable things he used his phone for, you'd better believe I took his phone away. He objected at the time, of course, but down the road he thanked me for doing it.\n\nYou're not 'stealing a grown man's property'. You were protecting him and others from his own delusions and actions that he will very likely regret later when he is himself again.\n\nI get it, I've been there.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the award - it's my first one! :-)", "Based on what you are telling us here, NTA. Your cousin is not in his right mind at this time, for whatever reason, and he needs supervision.  Please keep him from burning his life down.", "Ehhhhhh.  I\u2019m honestly torn on this.  If I was being a complete lunatic and saying horrible things to everyone, I\u2019d HOPE someone would take away my damn phone.  I suspect he\u2019s gonna be REALLY embarrassed when he comes to his senses.\n\nEdit:   NTA", "I may get downvoted to oblivion, but I'm going with NTA  for a few reasons.\n\nYour cousin may be in an altered mental state because of medication and pain. You know him better than anyone here. If his behavior is atypical,  it may be best for him not to have access to his personal phone at this time.\n\nThere is a phone in his hospital room.  People can call him. He can reach out to people whom he has memorized their phone numbers. \n\nBeing hospitalized doesn't give you the right to contact people at whatever time is convenient for you. Especially if you are upsetting them. Your cousin was told, by his surgeon, that his tumor was not cancerous. He is recovering proper post op care. I don't know why your cousin doesn't believe his surgeon, or is behaving in this manner. Perhaps medication? Perhaps pain? Perhaps fear? Perhaps some kind of breakdown or mental illness? \n\nAccess to his phone doesn't seem to be helping his progress. It may be impending it.\n\nYou and your aunt are nearby to support him. That is what he asked. Neither of you are going anywhere. You left his room when he asked. His behavior is unusual and unsettling to others who are not nearby. You retrieved his phone to protect him and others. You are willing to return to his room at any time. You and your aunt will be there,  to bring him home when he is discharged.\n\nI've spent a lot of time in the hospital. Most of it without a cellphone. No matter what others may think. I assume you, a cellphone is not a necessity for a hospital stay, especially since he only has two days remaining.", "NTA\n\nAnd I honestly don't get all these comments about \"HIS PROPERTY\". The way things were going, not having his phone for a few days would be the least of his worries. I don't know why people are ignoring - or wilfully misunderstanding - that the cousin is basically extremely high and sleep deprived. Effectively going through what is a temporary breakdown caused by his medical circumstances. He is obviously not in full posession of his mental capabilities and should be treated as such. In my country I don't think he would even be allowed to have a phone.\n\nAlso, if he were bored - something he clearly isn't - there are other forms of entertainment that don't include a phone. He has not been \"cut off\", hospitals have phones, and his family is nearby to wait on his hand and foot. The only reason they are not in the room with him is because he threw them out.\n\nMoreover, I think it was clear from the post she only spoke of the medical stuff to give context to the sittuation. She was not complaining about the treatment or saying he was being annoying, \n\nOP, stay strong. Your decision was sound.", "NTA\nYou had no legal permission to do it. But he does not seem to be in the mental state do handle a  phone. So you're not really an AH because you try to reduce damage.", "NTA. Yeah, it\u2019s his phone. He\u2019s also delusional, causing harm to others. He\u2019s also torpedoing his own life and social circle, which he\u2019ll need to heal. We take away a drunk\u2019s keys. I don\u2019t think this is much different.", "NTA. My husband has taken my phone away on a few occasions when I was drunk or on a bunch of pain meds and talking crazy. At the time I\u2019m always upset bc it\u2019s super important that I tell my mom my brother in law my sister is an alien from outer space and her real family is coming for her (one of my crazy attempted calls) but after it\u2019s over I\u2019m extremely glad he stopped me from that nonsense.", "NTA. Doctors and nurses tell family members all the time: \u201cwhen they\u2019re under the pain management here, they may say and do things that are very out of the norm for them. Do not take it personally.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve done it myself. Pain mgmt drugs mess up your ability to be totally in touch with reality. \n\nThey are NOT a good mix for phones and social media. The rest of the world doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re on medication. They may well take what you say seriously. Taking the phone away was a good thing. That\u2019s what you asked about, so the rest is just background. \n\nI suggest the game show network, if the hospital has that channel. It\u2019s awesome for when you\u2019re just a little too fucked up in recovery meds.", "Hmmmm. I\u2019m going to say NTA but I would speak to the medical team as he seems to be experiencing some post surgical delirium that they might be able to manage more effectively. \n\nNormally I would say Y T A for removing someone\u2019s autonomy in this way, but he seems to be not in control of his faculties and saying some things that could need quite a bit of cleaning up when he is better. \n\nYou also said it is until Wednesday - so just a few days. I would keep an eye on things and if he seems to be acting more normally then give it back.", "NTA. People in pain are mean and irrational. Not their fault but try to explain that to people they hurt lashing out.  \nHe'll be gratefull to you once he's back to himself", "NTA. And it would be a kindness to contact his boss and grandmother and explain that he was delusional. He will likely be grateful later.", "NAH. This is a tough situation, because obviously your cousin just had major surgery and is on some pretty serious meds. It sounds to me like he is super out of it, doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going, and is calling/texting everyone he knows while he is out of his mind on meds. I\u2019m not sure why the nurses didn\u2019t take his phone away, because it sounds like he should not have it. I would say neither of you is the asshole, and if I had to guess I would say that once he is out of the hospital, he will be calling you an asshole for not taking his phone away sooner! \n\nI have a cousin who has Down syndrome, and she was hospitalized due to COVID in January. She doesn\u2019t really know how to use a phone, so I don\u2019t have any stories of her calling anyone from the hospital, but once she was discharged, she was spewing all sorts of crazy stories about how she was handcuffed to her bed, and the fire department had to show up, and her doctor ended up being arrested. Obviously none of that happened, and the meds she was on were just messing with her head, but it sounds similar to your cousin thinking you were kicked out of the hospital for smoking. \n\nHope your cousin feels better soon!\n\nETA: give him back his phone once the surgery meds wear off and he\u2019s lucid. Because as others have pointed out, it is mind numbingly boring being stuck in a hospital waiting to be discharged.", "OP PLEASE READ!\n\nIf this is a major change in your cousins behavior or intensification of his regular character talk to his doctors and nurses! Pain for sure can change a person's attitude but one of my family members had an allergic reaction to the pain medication that caused him to hallucinate and made him super agitated. Because of this the pain didn't really get better and every dose of pain meds made him worse! \n\nHe had an emergency open surgery and was given dalaudid (or however you spell it). Allergic reactions that cause psych symptoms aren't always caught right away.", "You stopped him from continuing to sling abuse to you, his mother, and everyone else in your family. Being in the hospital sucks, then add being in terrible pain and on a cocktail of IV drugs...\n\nI'm going to say NTA. Yeah he's an adult and it's his property, but he seems to need some time to reflect and not lash out at everyone.\n\nThe original doctor wasn't wrong. He just assumed that it was malignant, like the vast majority of every other pancreatic tumors. Your cousin did have cancer. It just wasn't malignant- yet.", "YTA\n\nbut a necessary one\n\nYes, ah,thief, etc...but on behalf of your grandmother bless you. The pain, lack of sleep, meds, all the stress, he is understandably not in his right mind. I know the down votes are coming, but do you realize how embarrassed cousin will be? How would you feel if your own lunatic ravings upset grandma? I've been in cousin's shoes. I wish somebody could have shut me up. 10 year family running joke. I'm still embarrassed.", "Nta, you did the right thing", "NTA. You are doing him a favour. He will be grateful later.", "NTA, is he at Penn? My dad's had a few surgeries and spent a significant amount of time there and the nurses were pretty good about upping pain meds and giving sleep aids when asked. It's such an important part of the recovery process, and if it's to the point he's delusional than he definitely needs something more.", "I took the phone off my mum because she was delirious and making some very inappropriate comments that I knew she wouldn\u2019t want to make if she was in her right mind, and she was upsetting everyone else too.\nNTA", "Nta. I'm going under the assumption that this isn't normal behavior for him. He's not in his right mind and will thank you when he gets back to normal.", "Nta.

Look at how many people screwed themselves over with just one bad tweet", "NAH\n\nIt's not ideal that you took his phone, but you are protecting him from his actions when he is not rational due to illness \n\nI'm a cancer patient and I would feel horrible if I found out that I had said or done things like he has been doing.\n\nI took care of my partner with cancer, and when they got to the point of not making sense anymore I had to take their phone, hide the car keys, and put an alarm on the door in case they tried to leave.", "NTA - sometimes you gotta take the lumps to do what's right in the long run.

Otherwise mind your business.", "YTA  What gives you the right to take his phone away and dictate to him who he can/can't talk to?  Also, the rest of your posts makes little sense, either.\n\nWhether the tumor was cancerous or not, he still would have had to undergo surgery to remove it and have it examined by pathology.  You talk like the second doctor is dissing the first doctor because he thought it was cancerous?  Everyone should be thanking God and their lucky stars that it turned out to be NON-malignant.  When a mass is first suspected, they can rarely determine what type of tumor it is unless further testing is done.  Your cousin is recovering from major surgery.  He may become delusional as some narcotic pain meds can do that....so can anesthesia.  Of COURSE they are in there, often!  Taking frequent vital signs is necessary.  Getting him up and moving and walking, asap, helps in his recovery and helps prevent post operative blood clots from forming.  I'm not sure exactly what other kind of experience you were expecting, but major surgery and recovery is no walk in the park.  \n\nIn the meantime, give him HIS phone back, and stop attempting to control his recovery!

I certainly have seen this behavior in my patients. It is a REAL thing. Would I have taken the phone? As a nurse I want to say no, but again, I haven\u2019t seen the nuance of this situation. You, OP, know your cousin better than us. You sound reasonable and you have the best interest for your cousin. This wasn\u2019t done maliciously.

I made the huge mistake of Googling it and read that it can last for several weeks. \n\nWhen they finally brought him up to his room, he was completely out of it. He actually pushed me several times (the only times he's ever touched me in \"anger\") and told me to \"Get the fuck out of there.\" The nurses actually had him in restraints when he was down in recovery, but they removed them when they brought him up to the room. \n\nAfter sleeping for a few more hours, he thankfully woke up completely fine.

Screaming at the top of his lungs that he wants to sleep but these \u201cfucking cunt nurses\u201d won\u2019t let him sleep. I know he\u2019s been on the morphine button every six minutes with \u201cextra\u201d on demand since he went post op Friday night at 9pm. He\u2019s also on a liquid acetaminophen drip and another hardcore pain med. we did voice our concern (we were bawling to the nurse) and she\u2019s been through these a few times a week and this isn\u2019t an uncommon reaction unfortunately. And god bless the nurses because they are making him walk.", "Soooo. It\u2019s ok that he calls and quits work by calling his boss a cocksucker. He loses income and health insurance\u2026 dies because he has no health insurance. Home is lost because no income because of death. Wife and seven year old daughter now live on streets. But it\u2019s ok because at least he had his phone. Good thinking.", "Ummmm the. Your family isn\u2019t like ours. We are very close. I just gave them 20k towards this surgery. He called his boss a cocksucker and quit work. Honestly I don\u2019t even know if he realizes it\u2019s gone now. He also has a room phone. And his nurses agreed that I take it.", "Pancreatic cancer is a horrible diagnosis that *is* a death sentence most of the time. The treatable variants are extremely rare, and because your pancreas can get quite messed up for a long time without specific symptoms, it's usually only discovered after it's spread to other organs. Even when it's discovered early enough to operate, usually by accident, it almost always comes back. My dad only lived a week after diagnosis. Your cousin is incredibly lucky and his doctors aren't incompetent; he was just the extremely lucky guy whose hoofbeats were zebras and not horses. \n\nI'm assuming it's pain or meds or weird body chemicals (a messed up pancreas can make you very erratic, see: people with diabetic emergencies being mistaken for drunk) or fear or something that's making him behave like this. And he would hopefully be extremely embarrassed when he comes to his senses. In which case hell NTA, save him from further embarrassment.", "NTA:\nDelirious people often do not have capacity to act in their own best interest.\n\nThe things he is saying aren\u2019t just out of character and cruel, they are harming the people he says them to, and will harm *him* when he burns bridges while acutely confused and altered that cannot be unburned.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need a phone. He needs to recover. \nHis medical team should have been the ones to remove if from him, in his best interest.", "NTA - I recently had a small intestine resection.  I bought a bunch of crazy stuff and overdrafted my account.  \n\nI was telling my kids there needs to be an app or mode that lets you restrict things like shopping and blocks you from all calls but emergency, ICE, and uber for a controlled period.  Like I am going in for surgery 2 week lock.  Going out with my girls? 12 hour lock,  but still able to use Uber or Lyft.", "Shiiiiit! Neither of you are the AH. I\u2019m going to assume this is a departure from his usual behaviour. If it is, try to do some damage control on his behalf - things over with boss and grandma. Pancreatic tumours hurt like nothing you\u2019re likely to experience. I have sympathy for all involved.", "NTA - obviously, he is not in his right mind and once he is ok he will thank you. \n\nBut I did enjoy all thos AH voting y t a :D Like literally even without the edits, he is not playing games on the phone he is verbally abusing people. He can do without the phone for a bit not destroying his life.", "While he was in treatment for cancer my partner became fixated on breeding rare animals. It was cute when it was chickens. It became a problem when I had to find pet sitters for a Genet, a Tegu and Degus. Stress and fear make people behave in ways they wouldn't normally.", "Yeah, my mom had a bout of ICU psychosis after a major health event and surgery. She was completely out of her mind. Aside from being critically ill, she was extraordinarily sleep deprived.\n\nShe didn't have her phone, thankfully. If hate to think what she'd be posting on Facebook in that condition, lol.\n\nShe was convinced I was dead because I left briefly to go to the bathroom. There were small children mocking her from the corners. The nurses were trying to poison her. It was around Easter and they had decorations up and she was convinced the bunny decals were climbing off the walls and jumping on her bed.\n\nShe's fully recovered now she doesn't really remember much, but, yeah. No phone under those conditions is strongly recommended. Mostly because they need whatever sleep they can get.", "So very true. I had a surgical infection that landed me in the ICU for a week. I was completely delusional with paranoia and fever. Hallucinating that my bed was not on the floor but suspended from the wall, but still had enough marbles to know not to repeat that to family or hospital staff. I would have wanted my family to protect me from myself by ensuring I wasn\u2019t phoning my boss and others and destroying my credibility.", "NTA indeed. This is protecting him from further damage.\n\nMy mom also had to do this with my dad since he was recovering from surgery and he kept calling and texting the weirdest things to other family and his friends due to a delerium and medication. He said also the most ridiculous things when you were visiting him that did not make sense at all.\n\nHeck my mom even had to call and text all the people he contacted with his phone to do some mayor damage control. \n\nSo OP NTA", "Yep. They were hoping for the mini whipple. We came to the surgeon that invented that but tumor was too big and they had to do the classic.", "In my mind, I think he\u2019s having some kind of PTSD too. He just spent two weeks thinking he was dying. I\u2019m contacting trauma therapists in our area he can see when he feels a bit better. If he wants to.", "Sorry to hear about your dad. We\u2019re thinking he has PTSD. I\u2019m contacting trauma therapists in our area that he can talk to when he feels better.", "He just thought they were. It was part of his hallucinations.", "We don\u2019t smoke. We were wearing masks too. Nurses every 5 mins in room.", "Agree with the above poster, and get all the basics checked. My grandpa had pancreatic cancer, and one of the symptoms he had was hallucinations from lack of potassium. Luckily, we have funny/lovely stories of his ones but your cousin's altered mental state is alarming.\n\nHope you got some sleep!", "It definitely sounds like he's not in his right mind for whatever reason and you're acting with his best interests at heart. Best of luck.", "Anaesthesia and medication reactions can be really weird. I am a very laid back, chilled out person but certain meds will make me angry, snappy and generally an absolute misery to be around. \n\nAnaesthesia will have me swearing, crying and speaking Welsh, which is confusing for staff as my accent is very clearly English. I am not angry or upset though, I am swearing at how awesome everything in life is (this is fucking awesome etc) and crying with joy, but because I lose the ability to speak English they think something is wrong. I warn them in advance these days\\_.", "They aren't saying it was Tylenol with codeine specifically for the person op is dealing with, just that it's the one they reacted that way to. Gabapentin did it for me and I can almost guarantee that's not one if the medications prescribed in this situation. Morphine is likely however. \n\nPlus op mentions the person still being in agony and not sleeping well. Either of those alone can cause erratic behavior, especially combined with pain medication even if it's only taking the edge off and not fully working. Actually that makes it more likely because it can still give you the side effects without the full benefits. Like you're still woozy and irrational but it only makes you able to stand, not feel feel well enough to actually accomplish much.\n\nI'm speaking as someone who has worked in medical care and has chronic pain as well as having multiple surgeries and injuries due to a degenerative condition.", " if I take codeine I itch so bad that even my gums itch and I swear my hair does too. If that\u2019s not an allergy idk what it is. But everytime  I need a pain med and I tell them how I react to it the drs say it\u2019s an allergic reaction. So who ever is saying it\u2019s not is wrong. I mean I had surgery recently and my dr wouldn\u2019t give me it. He gave me tramadol. Which I hate almost as much."]}
