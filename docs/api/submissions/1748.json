The med care in our area is terrible and we decided to go to Philly to one of the best pancreatic surgeons in the world. I\u2019m currently in a hotel room with his mom (55) while he\u2019s in recovery at the hospital. \n\nFor the last two weeks he\u2019s been told he was going to die. That pancreatic cancer is a death sentence. So the day of the surgery,  this past Friday, after the surgery the surgeon tells his mom and I that it\u2019s a very rare non-cancerous tumor. And he\u2019s pissed at the original doctor in our area who said it was because \u201cany doctor who thought this was cancer is not a good doctor\u201d. \n\nCousin is in absolute pain. The nurses won\u2019t leave him alone. They\u2019re there every five minutes. They\u2019re forcing him to walk. He\u2019s sleep deprived and just down right mean. He\u2019s in such pain he\u2019s delusional. He kicked us out of the room which we are ok with but he thinks we got kicked out of the hospital because we were smoking in his room. \n\nHe\u2019s been texting everyone and calling everyone up (including his 80yo grandmother) either telling them that his mom and I are liars and he has cancer, or calling people and screaming at them about random shit. \n\nSo I went back to the hospital and took his phone. He yelled at me and said he needed it. I told him it wasn\u2019t helping his recovery and he\u2019ll get it back Wednesday on discharge. He was yelling at me even as I walked out the door and calling me the asshole\n\nAm I the asshole? I don\u2019t think I am but I feel terrible nonetheless.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t care about your medical opinions. nurses agree I take his phone. We are all very close. Things he\u2019s done:\nCalled his 80yo grandmother and said she\u2019s a piece of shit human who didn\u2019t care if he lived or died. That she never done anything for him. She helped raise him and even bought him a house. \n\nCalled his mom and screamed at her for not staying with her abusive ex that beat her so bad she was hospitalized for a week and broke my cousins leg \n\nCalled his boss and quit work by calling his boss a cocksucker (not the best time to do that). \n\nAlso stop saying he\u2019s going to take me to court. I just gifted them 20k for this surgery.", "created_utc": 1667855712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp0ngg/aita_for_taking_a_phone_away_from_hospitalized/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was a combination of the illness, the medications, and the trauma that landed him in the hospital.\n\nA few of his delusions at the time included:\n\n1. Believing there was a television on his wall, which he 'watched' regularly, and was hallucinating vivid, unlikely stories\n2. Phoning his dad to tell him that the nurses were trying to poison him\n3. Physically fighting said nurses when they tried to medicate him\n4. Making social media posts about how the entire hospital staff had been fired (??? never understood this one LOL)\n5. Thinking that someone had hacked his email and were using a sex tape of us to blackmail him (no tape existed)\n\nThese were things we actually had a good laugh about together after the crisis was over and he was on the road to recovery.\n\nAfter the first couple of questionable things he used his phone for, you'd better believe I took his phone away. He objected at the time, of course, but down the road he thanked me for doing it.\n\nYou're not 'stealing a grown man's property'. You were protecting him and others from his own delusions and actions that he will very likely regret later when he is himself again.\n\nI get it, I've been there.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the award - it's my first one! :-)", "Based on what you are telling us here, NTA. Your cousin is not in his right mind at this time, for whatever reason, and he needs supervision.  Please keep him from burning his life down.", "Ehhhhhh.  I\u2019m honestly torn on this.  If I was being a complete lunatic and saying horrible things to everyone, I\u2019d HOPE someone would take away my damn phone.  I suspect he\u2019s gonna be REALLY embarrassed when he comes to his senses.", "I may get downvoted to oblivion, but I'm going with NTA  for a few reasons.\n\nYour cousin may be in an altered mental state because of medication and pain. You know him better than anyone here. If his behavior is atypical,  it may be best for him not to have access to his personal phone at this time.\n\nThere is a phone in his hospital room.  People can call him. He can reach out to people whom he has memorized their phone numbers. \n\nBeing hospitalized doesn't give you the right to contact people at whatever time is convenient for you. Especially if you are upsetting them. Your cousin was told, by his surgeon, that his tumor was not cancerous. He is recovering proper post op care. I don't know why your cousin doesn't believe his surgeon, or is behaving in this manner. Perhaps medication? Perhaps pain? Perhaps fear? Perhaps some kind of breakdown or mental illness? \n\nAccess to his phone doesn't seem to be helping his progress. It may be impending it.\n\nYou and your aunt are nearby to support him. That is what he asked. Neither of you are going anywhere. You left his room when he asked. His behavior is unusual and unsettling to others who are not nearby. You retrieved his phone to protect him and others. You are willing to return to his room at any time. You and your aunt will be there,  to bring him home when he is discharged.\n\nI've spent a lot of time in the hospital. Most of it without a cellphone. No matter what others may think. I assume you, a cellphone is not a necessity for a hospital stay, especially since he only has two days remaining.", "NTA\n\nAnd I honestly don't get all these comments about \"HIS PROPERTY\". The way things were going, not having his phone for a few days would be the least of his worries. I don't know why people are ignoring - or wilfully misunderstanding - that the cousin is basically extremely high and sleep deprived. Effectively going through what is a temporary breakdown caused by his medical circumstances. He is obviously not in full posession of his mental capabilities and should be treated as such. In my country I don't think he would even be allowed to have a phone.\n\nAlso, if he were bored - something he clearly isn't - there are other forms of entertainment that don't include a phone. He has not been \"cut off\", hospitals have phones, and his family is nearby to wait on his hand and foot. The only reason they are not in the room with him is because he threw them out.\n\nMoreover, I think it was clear from the post she only spoke of the medical stuff to give context to the sittuation. She was not complaining about the treatment or saying he was being annoying, \n\nOP, stay strong. Your decision was sound.", "NTA\nYou had no legal permission to do it. But he does not seem to be in the mental state do handle a  phone. So you're not really an AH because you try to reduce damage.", "NTA. Yeah, it\u2019s his phone. He\u2019s also delusional, causing harm to others. He\u2019s also torpedoing his own life and social circle, which he\u2019ll need to heal. We take away a drunk\u2019s keys. I don\u2019t think this is much different.", "NTA. My husband has taken my phone away on a few occasions when I was drunk or on a bunch of pain meds and talking crazy. At the time I\u2019m always upset bc it\u2019s super important that I tell my mom my brother in law my sister is an alien from outer space and her real family is coming for her (one of my crazy attempted calls) but after it\u2019s over I\u2019m extremely glad he stopped me from that nonsense.", "NTA. Doctors and nurses tell family members all the time: \u201cwhen they\u2019re under the pain management here, they may say and do things that are very out of the norm for them. Do not take it personally.\u201d I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve done it myself. Pain mgmt drugs mess up your ability to be totally in touch with reality. \n\nThey are NOT a good mix for phones and social media. The rest of the world doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re on medication. They may well take what you say seriously. Taking the phone away was a good thing. That\u2019s what you asked about, so the rest is just background. \n\nI suggest the game show network, if the hospital has that channel. It\u2019s awesome for when you\u2019re just a little too fucked up in recovery meds.", "Hmmmm. I\u2019m going to say NTA but I would speak to the medical team as he seems to be experiencing some post surgical delirium that they might be able to manage more effectively. \n\nNormally I would say Y T A for removing someone\u2019s autonomy in this way, but he seems to be not in control of his faculties and saying some things that could need quite a bit of cleaning up when he is better. \n\nYou also said it is until Wednesday - so just a few days. I would keep an eye on things and if he seems to be acting more normally then give it back.", "NTA. People in pain are mean and irrational. Not their fault but try to explain that to people they hurt lashing out.  \nHe'll be gratefull to you once he's back to himself", "NTA. And it would be a kindness to contact his boss and grandmother and explain that he was delusional. He will likely be grateful later.", "NAH. This is a tough situation, because obviously your cousin just had major surgery and is on some pretty serious meds. It sounds to me like he is super out of it, doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going, and is calling/texting everyone he knows while he is out of his mind on meds. I\u2019m not sure why the nurses didn\u2019t take his phone away, because it sounds like he should not have it. I would say neither of you is the asshole, and if I had to guess I would say that once he is out of the hospital, he will be calling you an asshole for not taking his phone away sooner! \n\nI have a cousin who has Down syndrome, and she was hospitalized due to COVID in January. She doesn\u2019t really know how to use a phone, so I don\u2019t have any stories of her calling anyone from the hospital, but once she was discharged, she was spewing all sorts of crazy stories about how she was handcuffed to her bed, and the fire department had to show up, and her doctor ended up being arrested. Obviously none of that happened, and the meds she was on were just messing with her head, but it sounds similar to your cousin thinking you were kicked out of the hospital for smoking. \n\nHope your cousin feels better soon!\n\nETA: give him back his phone once the surgery meds wear off and he\u2019s lucid. Because as others have pointed out, it is mind numbingly boring being stuck in a hospital waiting to be discharged.", "OP PLEASE READ!\n\nIf this is a major change in your cousins behavior or intensification of his regular character talk to his doctors and nurses! Pain for sure can change a person's attitude but one of my family members had an allergic reaction to the pain medication that caused him to hallucinate and made him super agitated. Because of this the pain didn't really get better and every dose of pain meds made him worse! \n\nHe had an emergency open surgery and was given dalaudid (or however you spell it). Allergic reactions that cause psych symptoms aren't always caught right away.", "You stopped him from continuing to sling abuse to you, his mother, and everyone else in your family. Being in the hospital sucks, then add being in terrible pain and on a cocktail of IV drugs...\n\nI'm going to say NTA. Yeah he's an adult and it's his property, but he seems to need some time to reflect and not lash out at everyone.\n\nThe original doctor wasn't wrong. He just assumed that it was malignant, like the vast majority of every other pancreatic tumors. Your cousin did have cancer. It just wasn't malignant- yet.", "YTA\n\nbut a necessary one\n\nYes, ah,thief, etc...but on behalf of your grandmother bless you. The pain, lack of sleep, meds, all the stress, he is understandably not in his right mind. I know the down votes are coming, but do you realize how embarrassed cousin will be? How would you feel if your own lunatic ravings upset grandma? I've been in cousin's shoes. I wish somebody could have shut me up. 10 year family running joke. I'm still embarrassed.", "Nta, you did the right thing", "NTA. You are doing him a favour. He will be grateful later.", "NTA, is he at Penn? My dad's had a few surgeries and spent a significant amount of time there and the nurses were pretty good about upping pain meds and giving sleep aids when asked. It's such an important part of the recovery process, and if it's to the point he's delusional than he definitely needs something more.", "I took the phone off my mum because she was delirious and making some very inappropriate comments that I knew she wouldn\u2019t want to make if she was in her right mind, and she was upsetting everyone else too.\nNTA", "Nta. I'm going under the assumption that this isn't normal behavior for him. He's not in his right mind and will thank you when he gets back to normal.", "Nta. Your basically acting as a PR manager for him. Sometimes we need someone to take away a phn from someone before they have a meltdown or in process of one.  Look at how many people screwed themselves over with just one bad tweet", "NAH\n\nIt's not ideal that you took his phone, but you are protecting him from his actions when he is not rational due to illness \n\nI'm a cancer patient and I would feel horrible if I found out that I had said or done things like he has been doing.\n\nI took care of my partner with cancer, and when they got to the point of not making sense anymore I had to take their phone, hide the car keys, and put an alarm on the door in case they tried to leave.", "NTA - sometimes you gotta take the lumps to do what's right in the long run.

He\u2019s a grown adult, you stole from him. If he\u2019s bothering you, block him. Otherwise mind your business.", "YTA  What gives you the right to take his phone away and dictate to him who he can/can't talk to?  Also, the rest of your posts makes little sense, either.\n\nWhether the tumor was cancerous or not, he still would have had to undergo surgery to remove it and have it examined by pathology.  You talk like the second doctor is dissing the first doctor because he thought it was cancerous?  Everyone should be thanking God and their lucky stars that it turned out to be NON-malignant.  When a mass is first suspected, they can rarely determine what type of tumor it is unless further testing is done.  Your cousin is recovering from major surgery.  He may become delusional as some narcotic pain meds can do that....so can anesthesia.  Of COURSE they are in there, often!  Taking frequent vital signs is necessary.  Getting him up and moving and walking, asap, helps in his recovery and helps prevent post operative blood clots from forming.  I'm not sure exactly what other kind of experience you were expecting, but major surgery and recovery is no walk in the park.  \n\nIn the meantime, give him HIS phone back, and stop attempting to control his recovery!   You seem like the annoying one, not him!", "YTA \n\nHe has cancer and just had surgery, who are you to police how he\u2019s handling all that??\n\nHe\u2019s not a child, give him back his phone.", "INFO: who exactly are you that entitles you to take away a 36 year old man's property while he is in the hospital?

I certainly have seen this behavior in my patients. It is a REAL thing. Would I have taken the phone? As a nurse I want to say no, but again, I haven\u2019t seen the nuance of this situation.

I made the huge mistake of Googling it and read that it can last for several weeks. \n\nWhen they finally brought him up to his room, he was completely out of it.

I work in surgery and we absolutely need to know this information. You\u2019re a good person, I can tell you have everyone\u2019s best interest in mind here.", "Sorry, my conscience ...just can't. A justified AH is still an AH. Sometimes you just have to own it. Again, I apologize. Mods will do what mods do.", "Let it blow over. He may just thank you some day. Many blessings to the kindest AH in a long time. Your heart is in the right place.", "Good. Now give him back his phone. Extra stress isn\u2019t helping his recovery. Connecting to people outside the hospital is.", "If he asked for it, you sure as hell should of. You aren't his custodian. Those aren't your things to pick and choose to provide or not. It's his belongings, and his right to say whatever he wants on them, even if those things are wrong.\n\nYTA 100%, I'd suggest you bring him back his stuff before he presses charges. At this point, I sure as hell would.", "You are not in charge of him. Look- just ask the doctor what is best and stick to that. If the doc says no phone, then no phone. If the doc says he can have it, then give it back.", "Oh thank goodness!\n\nWhat a great boss.", "No. I respect a justified ah. It\u2019s in the judgement itself \u201cjustified asshole\u201d.", "No. He\u2019s causing his 80yo grandmother to scream and cry. He needs to sleep instead of focusing on his phone and screaming at people. But I accept your judgment", "By the sounds of it he doesn't know if it's Thursday or January or if his name is yellow.  Op even said the nursing staff said that under the circumstances it was best to remove his phone.  If the cousin was properly compus mentus it would be different,  but for this temporary period Op was right to remove the phone and nta.", "Well the nurse said it was a good idea.", "All things considered, everything has been a miracle and throughout this all, his boss has been amazing.", "justified asshole is NTA in these parts", "He thought he was going to die, so the prospect of living may terrify. It sucks not to have a device to occupy you when you are used to it. Obtain a cheap kindle fire, set it up restricted in kids mode witNV, bh a brand new throwaway email. Download some contet rlelated to his interests,  audiobooks, mindless games, YouTube videos, etc. That will be all he can access from his profile. This might help sharpen his mind, and make you less of a \"bad guy\"... something like this may be needed ling past Wednesday, although after Wednesday maybe he could \"check out\" his phone a while like a teen on restriction, working back up. \n\nAnd realize this... in the face of death, he has likely considered everything that might've made his life better from a very narrow perspective, so these out of character comments may continue for a while. He will need a lot of support and likely some therapy. \n\nKeep up the great work... and maybe even call grandma and fib a little, saying he said he was so sorry \ud83d\ude09", "He's an adult, not one of your students. You stole it.", "No, what he needs is for you to give him his phone and leave him alone. Your grans inability to control herself isn\u2019t the hospitalized persons problem.
