{"id": 21157, "submission_id": "14otkx0", "title": "AITA for ignoring a guy that made me uncomfortable?", "selftext": "I recently went on a trip with my friend organized by my uni class. On the first day this guy from another class approached us and asked if he could join us for lunch. We noticed that everyone else in his class was avoiding him, but we thought he was lonely, so we agreed fo him to eat with us. Immediatly it's clear why his classmates ignore him: he seems to be unaware of most of social clues and has uncommon hobbies. However I try to be nice to him. My friend on the other side keeps being rude to him, and acts very bothered by his presence.\n\nThe trip goes on and the guy keeps staring at us from afar, tries to interact with us, despite us clearly showing we want to be by ourselves. He asks both me and my friend for our numbers, to go out for drinks later that night. We say no. However, he waits until I am alone, and corners me asking again for my number. I give in since professors are close by and I don't want to cause a scene. Maybe this is where I made a mistake. Throughout the day he starts complimenting me, specifically my phisical appereance. I do not engage with him. Then he starts complaining that I never speak, that still he knows nothing about me. Professors jump in on that agreeing that I am extra quiet. I admit I am sensitive about this topic, so I start becoming extra uncomfortable. This constant bother continues, with him complaining that I am not speaking enough, that I am not smiling etcetera.\n\nI was already uncomfortable at this point. I make a joke to my friend: I see a bed exposed in a shop window, saying I was so tired I would gladly go sleep there. The guy chimes in, commenting that lots of people would surely pay to look at me. My friend scolds him for being a creep and he plays dumb.\n\nLater that night we go to dinner and this guy of course sits in front of me. My friend sits next to me, but with her back directed towards me throughout the whole dinner, so I am forced to interact with this guy, while professors keep teasing me because I am so quiet. My friend even encourages the guy to keep talking to me, despite me previously telling her I was very uncomfortable. In the end the guy asks me to go out together. I refuse, saying I am very busy (at this point I was panicking and I was so stupid not to say I am in a relationship or that I am not interested). He keeps insisting and I keep rejecting him.\n\nFinally the dinner ends, and I am very upset both at him and at my friend for not helping me at all through this uncomfortable situation. The first day we are all back home, he texts me \"how are you\". Ofc I don't reply, since I am still bothered. My friend however tells me I was being too harsh on him.\n\nAITA? I feel like I gave him so many signals that I was not interested and he actively chose to ignore them. On the other side maybe I was not clear enough on not being interested in him.", "created_utc": 1688318040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14otkx0/aita_for_ignoring_a_guy_that_made_me_uncomfortable/", "score": 1375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously the asshole here is the overly aggressive man.\n\nFurther, it could be dangerous if you give him more attention when you are not interested. He obviously doesn't get the attention he wants/needs, so you giving him any attention will just make him feel like you are interested. He could easily do something crazy thinking there's something there.

It's ok to just let this go. Maybe block his number.", "This post is a disaster on so many levels.\n\nFirst, you are on a trip with a university group. It is normal (and expected) for you to have normal social interactions with other members of your group. It's very much not OK to exclude a member of your group because he has unusual hobbies. You don't have to be his best buddy, but you owe him normal social politeness.\n\nSecond, you don't owe him your phone number, or a date. Normal social politeness does not require you to give him either, and \"no\" is a complete sentence.\n\nThird, your friend is a complete asshole. She has been flat-out rude to this guy throughout the trip, but then says that you're being too harsh on him for not wanting to go out with him? Your friend needs a serious attitude adjustment. You don't owe this guy a date. You're free to turn him down for whatever reason (including, but not limited, to the fact that you don't enjoy his company, he doesn't share your hobbies, and so on.) But you both owe him basic social civility, and your friend seems to have failed at this.\n\nFourth, the guy is an asshole. He might be a socially awkward guy with odd hobbies, but he needs to understand that a direct \"no\" to a request for a date is the end of the conversation. It is not an invitation to ask again.\n\nFifth, you need to use your words, and speak clearly and unambiguously. Stop \"sending signals\" and assuming that everyone else has the same codebook that you have. It's completely OK to tell someone, politely, that you're not interested in dating them. (And tell them this. Don't give excuses about how you're tired, or busy that night, or whatever else, because a lot of people will hear that as \"I would, but not on this occasion.\" If you're not interested in someone, tell them, in polite but unambiguous language, that you're not interested.\n\nSo ESH, I think.", "NTA\n\nand you are NOT stupid for saying you were busy instead of something else, like you\u2019re already in a relationship or not interested. He should have taken the hint long before it got to that point, and you were being soft with him because he was scaring you; you know men can be dangerous when they\u2019re being rejected, and you were doing what felt safest (so as to not set this weirdo off). \n\nEveryone here failed you. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is NOT your friend. And fuck those professors, too.", "NTA. You need to spoke with him and tell him directly that you dont wanna interact with him because he make you unconfortable.\nIf he keep pushing or your teachers keep teling that you dont Talk to much, you need to anser directly that its because that Guy is make you unconfortable and dont let you alone.", "NTA - It\u2019s your choice who you do and do not want to associate with.", "NTA- and I didn\u2019t need to read your post to know that. You should never ever ever feel bad for recognizing you feel unsafe and conducting yourself accordingly. Women stay alive this way.", "NTA Literally, everyone else in this situation is. Your friend, your professors, and this guy have confused coercion with consent. The way they all handled it is gross.\n\nYou are not obligated to give anyone your time and attention, especially if you are uncomfortable.

You need to tell him you are not comfortable speaking with him and for him to leave you alone. Do not be alone with him. Have a buddy system. He is deranged and you are in danger. You need to speak up or it will get worse. \n\nThat is NOT your friend. You need to block his number and file a complaint to the school. Your teachers should not be talking to you like that or making fun of you. Please look into therapy. I am very worried about you. Predators like this guy look for people like you who don\u2019t fight back.", "NTA.  Tell him you are not interested in talking to him or hanging out with him.  Tell him to leave you alone.  Then block him.  You are under no obligation to give anyone your number or your time.  The professor was creepy, this guy was creepy.  \n\nNext time someone is making you uncomfortable, just leave them.  Excuse yourself, say goodbye, and go talk to someone else, just leave their presence.  You told people several times you were uncomfortable.  They didn't care.  It's ok to be \"rude\" to leave uncomfortable situations.  Signals and subtle hints don't work with boundary crushers.  And your friend doesn't seem to be any help either.  Friends have your back.", "NTA,  and your friend is not a friend.  You don't have to make any excuses or have any reason for not engaging someone and I'm horrified on your behalf that your professors were encouraging his behavior. Block them all.", "NTA \u2013 This is specifically in response to your AITA question. Obviously you aren\u2019t the asshole for ignoring the guy\u2019s text! I\u2019d give him an unequivocal \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m not interested, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have given you my number\u2019 (then escalate straight to \u2018don\u2019t contact me again\u2019 plus a block if needed), but you do you. Your friend is the asshole over the text message issue.\n\nThe situation as a whole is a pretty clear ESH (I edited my post to change it from that). This is because \u201casshole\u201d means \u201cat fault\u201d in this sub. Although the guy is massively at fault, you\u2019re also at fault for giving him your number, as that is a big signal. You\u2019re right to complain about the guy missing clear signals, but much of it occurred after, *and was encouraged by*, you giving your number. It's also the means by which the problem has extended beyond the class trip.\n\nBear in mind that this isn\u2019t results-oriented thinking. You were kind at the outset, but giving out your number was a huge mistake, as you already had plenty of information on which to judge he would likely be a problem. Yet you still did so because you didn\u2019t want to cause a scene with your professors close?! If your professors were there, you weren\u2019t \u201ccornered\u201d or \u201calone\u201d; you just didn\u2019t want to deal with the second-hand social embarrassment of flat out rejecting him.\n\nKudos to you for wanting to be kind to the guy initially, and for owning your mistake on giving out your number. I don\u2019t see how the people ignoring the nuances of what happened are being helpful or true to the sub\u2019s purpose if they give you an NTA for the situation as a whole (ie not just the text message issue).\n\nYour friend is an asshole for not helping you more, especially as the problem arose because you were trying to be nice (to be fair, she did call him a \u201ccreep\u201d when he was coming on to you). Especially at dinner, it seems she was getting her petty revenge for you not following her lead. You missed a middle ground of being nicer than your friend \\[if you wanted to be\\], but less nice than you were.\n\nThe guy is obviously the biggest asshole for missing all of the hints you gave him, and generally sounds like a total nightmare. I need not say more here.\n\n(NB. paragraphs 5-6 are verbatim from my original ESH post; paragraphs 2-4 mix new and old text; paragraph 1 is obviously new)", "YTA\n\nI gotta step in and try to offer a different perspective here. You gave this guy your phone number, and then weakly declined his date request by saying \u2018no, i\u2019m too busy\u2019.\n\nThese \u201csocial cues\u201d you speak of are not a rule. It\u2019s unfair of you to expect somebody to pick up on your \u201csignals\u201d. Be an adult, use your words.\n\nAnd btw, giving somebody your phone number is a \u2018social cue\u2019 and a \u2018signal\u2019 that you are open to the idea of going on a date with this person.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that you were so uncomfortable throughout this whole experience, but IMO you have nobody to blame but yourself. Learn how to speak up, learn how to be direct, and quit being so childish about uncomfortable situations.", "NAH - Except maybe your friend. \n\nYou were definitely not an AH. You were polite but firm with a gentleman who was expressing unreciprocated romantic feelings towards you. You do not owe anyone anything and certainly aren\u2019t expected to date someone you\u2019re not interested in simply because they want you to.\n\nThis guy, while clearly lacking in the social skills department, is also not an AH. He probably should have taken the hint but he at no point was he aggressive with you, he didn\u2019t try to guilt you into dating him, and he didn\u2019t try to force himself on you physically.\n\nYour friend on the other hand sounds like a textbook pot stirrer who \u201chates drama\u201d but always seems to be right in the middle of it.

Once at a school party when a creepy classmate was hitting on one of my friends, all of her friends including me made ways to distract him and distance him from her, as friends should do (making sure she was never alone with him, whenever he tried to talk to her one of our guy friends kept on pulling him aside for conversations, making sure whenever she sat down he couldn't sit next to her).

You did, however, fall into a common trap that a lot of us do when we're younger: being concerned about causing a scene and being nice.  As I've gotten older, it's been easier and easier to just cut people off--not rudely, but decisively.  I've become more confident in brushing people off that I don't want to deal with, whether they're selling something, seeking romance, or what have you.\n\nDon't feel bad: as I said, a lot of us do that, men and women both, but especially women because we're socialized to be very concerned--sometimes overly concerned--about the feelings of others.  I hope you'll use this experience to help you build the confidence to speak up when you're feeling uncomfortable, to push back when it seems like someone is stampeding you to do something you don't want, and to seek out others when someone is breaking your boundaries and you feel like you need help.", "NTA at all, you gave a lot of clear signals that you weren't interested and he kept being an absolute trash can of a person.

I can\u2019t believe about all the people who just zeroed in on the mixed signals part, completely ignoring that you already clearly said no the first time he asked for your number. And then, he waited until your friend left you, to ask for your number again while you were alone. I would have been scared in that situation too, and the ones who say \u201cjust be clear, say no - not interested\u201d have no clue how scary it can be for a woman who is faced with a persistent man who clearly will not take no as an answer. A man, who clearly does not act in accordance to social norms, and a man you don\u2019t know that well, so you don\u2019t know how he would react to rejection.

If he really does struggle with social cues how is it going to read if you already gave him your number, usually that indicated that someone does like another person, & then you said \"no, *I'm busy*. Maybe he just needs to be told straight up \"I'm sorry but this isn't going to work out & respectfully I would like to cut all communication with you\" I don't think anyone is necessarily an AH (except for the one who turned their back on you) but really just a lack of communication all around.", "Knew him in the scrotum", "As a college prof this really struck me: \"Professors jump in on that agreeing that I am extra quiet.\"  so this creeper was sexually harassing you right in front of them and they were agreeing with him-- then later your professors kept teasing you because you were quiet?

Read it, and never doubt yourself for making firm boundaries.", "TLDR; I was open to being sympathetic to the dude until I got to the part where OP started explaining more in depth what does and says. I went through a very similar situation where a similar guy became very dangerous. \n\nWhat gets me is that at first I wasn\u2019t sure if he would actually end up being creepy, or just having social struggles/potentially developmental delays. Some of what she described at first reminded me a lot of times where my autistic/adhd ass has struggled more severely when it came to social stuff (it\u2019s up and down for me), but then she started really getting into what he was doing and I lost all empathy/sympathy for him. The stuff like looking over when being avoided, having \u201cuncommon\u201d hobbies (whatever that means, too vague to know), struggling with social cues\u2026 all of that I get. All of those are things I\u2019ve struggled with to some extent through out my life. It wouldn\u2019t mean OP has to expose herself to discomfort if he had turned out to be autistic or have ADHD, just that some empathy would be warranted.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case though, like sure, it\u2019s possible those are things he has that could explain some of his behavior, but the main issues aren\u2019t actually things that can be explained by it, at this point in life he should know how to take a \u201cno\u201d and back off. His behavior may seem like it\u2019s just an annoyance, but he is focusing on OP. We don\u2019t know if he does this with others, if he has in the past, if he does now, how far he has or does take it with others. All we really know is that he is focusing on OP and refusing to back off after being told \u201cno\u201d several times. Even if OP believes she may not have given a \u201cvalid\u201d enough excuse for saying \u201cno\u201d she still said it and it should be respected. Being single doesn\u2019t mean she owes her time or self to someone and her discomfort in directly saying she wasn\u2019t interested is okay, she should trust her gut.\n\nHis behavior is escalating, trusting her gut is important. People treat behavior like his like it\u2019s not serious, like people who become scared are being dramatic. Personally, being dramatic has potentially saved my life in a somewhat similar situation with a past coworker. He escalated to the point where he would send me and her snapchats of him loading a gun or holding a loaded one. The snaps were captioned stuff like \u201cthis is for you\u201d and other scary stuff. Even after that we were called dramatic, told he\u2019s not going to do anything. Dude ended up stalking me, like almost every time I went somewhere he would show up. I eventually found out that he had turned my Snapchat location services on when I had put my phone down at work for a moment and I guess hadn\u2019t locked it. Even with that I was told I was dramatic, he\u2019s harmless, he isn\u2019t going to hurt me. The dude who had sent snaps of loaded guns and showed up pretty much wherever I went was called harmless. It\u2019s not like it went from 0-100, it was just that with each escalation I was told I was being dramatic. I just want to show that this guys behavior shouldn\u2019t be treated like it\u2019s just an \u201cannoyance\u201d when it shows that he is clearly escalating. Yes, we don\u2019t know how far he will escalate, it could turn out totally fine, but no one knows until something happens. In my situation we were thankfully able to avoid anything violent happening, but that\u2019s because we were able to get Peace Orders (the step before restraining orders in non-sexual/non-romantic relationships where I live). The Peace Orders were granted after what seems to have been a \u201chit list\u201d/manifesto outline was found after it fell out of his pocket at work.\n\nOP, don\u2019t let anyone dissuade you from trusting your gut. You don\u2019t know how far this guy will go, just that he is taking it a bit farther and farther as time goes on. You aren\u2019t dramatic, he isn\u2019t harmless. Even if he physically never hurts you or anyone else, he is still harming you. He is breaking down your peace of mind, your comfort in your surroundings, challenging your autonomy and pushing boundaries while your friends enable it. Your friend enabled it, which you pretty much acknowledged. She likely did that because to her it\u2019s better you than her, she had the ability to avoid his focus and put you directly into it. If you decide to speak with her about this post and see my comment, then maybe show it to her?

I think other dudes need to help each other/ these guys figure their shit out because it can be LONELY being a single guy without friends in town or platonic touch.

He's a fucking asshole. Sadly there more people like this & your kindness can get you into trouble.", "NTA. You have every right to choose who you interact with.

You have ZERO OBLIGATION to go on a pity date with someone who makes you feel uncomfortable or who may be potentially dangerous. \n\nYour \"friend\" should be ashamed.", "NTA. As a shy person and an introvert, I'm sick of people telling me to speak up, as if it's some switch I can just turn on and my personality changes.

Report him if he won\u2019t stop bothering you.", ">he seems to be unaware of most of social clues and has uncommon hobbies\n\nAs an autistic woman, I want to add some context. This guy sounds autistic. Your friend sucks for being rude to him just because he's socially awkward. I don't think he's playing dumb or pretending not to understand social cues. Your friend also sucks for encouraging him to keep talking to you despite your being uncomfortable. Your friend sounds like she enjoys mocking both this person and your discomfort, making both of you into the scapegoat.\n\nThis guy's behavior was inappropriate, whether he realizes it or not, and I don't blame you for being very uncomfortable. You should not have to tell a guy more than once that you're not interested. You will have to be very direct to get your point across. I'm very direct, so I would text him telling him he made you uncomfortable by not taking no for an answer, and you no longer wish to talk to him. You are not being too harsh on him by saying this. I can't speak for him, but if I got a text like this explaining what I did wrong in a social situation I would be grateful. NTA", "NTA\n\nStranger danger...please stay safe and surround yourself with actual friends.", "NTA, but... did you ever actually *say* that you weren't interested? Or did you just hope that a guy who clearly wasn't good at picking up on social cues would... pick up on your social cues?", "NTA and I\u2019m angry for you at your professors.", "NTA \n\nIf anything you\u2019re not being harsh enough. Fuck his feelings, honestly who cares.", "**NTA**\n\nBlock his number.", "NTA but you're sadly surrounded by them and I'm sorry for that, OP. this sounds like a \"Let's Not Meet\" story waiting to happen. despite it being such a common theme in those stories I don't doubt their validity; so many men think they own women simply because it's what they want. it doesn't matter if this creep \"can't read social cues\"; he knew EXACTLY what he was doing. your friend and professors suck. they need to look out for you not enable his behavior! yikes :(", "NTA. Also, he's maybe atypical. Hints and social cues go over his head. He'd have understood \"You don't understand my pcommunication and there's no reason for me to spend any more time with or around you.\"", "NTA. He is a creep and he deserves bluntness.", "NTA. but I would say simply text him that you have no interest. While it's probably not going to make a difference if it ever progresses into needing to make a complaint about him not leaving you alone you can use the text as evidence you made it clear in no uncertain terms you were not interesting and never showed any interest in dating or wanting to hang out with him.\n\nI'd also send a email to the professors saying that this guy was talking at you without taking the hint to leave you alone and that you didn't want to be rude and them joking about you being quiet was not at all welcomed. They were ridiculously unprofessional and apparently blind as to why you were being quiet around someone making you uncomfortable and they 'joined in' with him saying you were too quiet rather than say telling him to take the hint.", "But in TV and movies, if a nerdy but sweet guy is persistent he gets super hot girls!\n\nNTA.

A lot of people considered creepy are also autistic.", "What pissed me off the most was the professors actions. They're adults and they made fun of OP instead of helping.", "That sounds like a you problem my dude, curate what you follow more.", "I think you\u2019re just describing therapy and I\u2019m all for it. Too many people seek therapy to learn how to handle the men in their lives while the guys refuse and just listen to pick up artist podcasts on how to emotionally abuse women.", "Dear OP you are NTA for ignoring him when he made you uncomfortable. What he did to you is unacceptable and super un-okay!! Please don't be hard on yourself and this is not your fault. No, you are NOT being harsh on him for disrespecting your boundaries\n\nI am going to provide you some advice what you need to do in the event he does it again\n\n1. Block his number immediately and do not respond to him. \n2. If you have social media e.g. Facebook, Instagram and/or Twitter, quickly change up your private settings and if he happens to be in the social media realm block him immediately then he cannot add or follow you. The same applies if you have a LinkedIn account\n3. If he keeps bothering you, do not be afraid to confide in the uni counsellor, a uni tutor you trust or safety uni campus group. You can seek help and support from your uni's feminist organisations\n4. Do you have other uni mates or friends you can trust and help you? If you do, come up with a safety plan to keep you safe so that he cannot approach you or try to be funny with you. Don't be afraid to ask your uni mates and friends to chaperone you to and from classes to your car or public transport to ensure he does not follow you home\n5. Someone told me this: screw politeness dealing with creeps like him. Don't be afraid to be angry and/or rude and make a scene. You can practice it with a trusted friend, uni mate or loved one. Practice until you finally get it and unleash your anger on him. Make it loud and tell him this \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" or \"I AM NOT DAMN INTERESTED AND WHAT PART OF NOT INTERESTED YOU DON'T GET\" \n6. If university refuses to help, you can seek help from a local women's organisation to get the help you need \n7. Are you working part time? If you are please tell your manager, boss and coworkers about that creep and tell them you don't want your privacy (e.g. home address, phone or your after hour activities) leaked to him if he calls or visits your workplace\n\nStay safe and give us an update", "Thank you for this explanation. This whole thing is like a creepy mystery to me. Understanding is a key."]}
