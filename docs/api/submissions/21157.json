On the first day this guy from another class approached us and asked if he could join us for lunch. We noticed that everyone else in his class was avoiding him, but we thought he was lonely, so we agreed fo him to eat with us. Immediatly it's clear why his classmates ignore him: he seems to be unaware of most of social clues and has uncommon hobbies. However I try to be nice to him. My friend on the other side keeps being rude to him, and acts very bothered by his presence.\n\nThe trip goes on and the guy keeps staring at us from afar, tries to interact with us, despite us clearly showing we want to be by ourselves. He asks both me and my friend for our numbers, to go out for drinks later that night. We say no. However, he waits until I am alone, and corners me asking again for my number. I give in since professors are close by and I don't want to cause a scene. Maybe this is where I made a mistake. Throughout the day he starts complimenting me, specifically my phisical appereance. I do not engage with him. Then he starts complaining that I never speak, that still he knows nothing about me. Professors jump in on that agreeing that I am extra quiet. I admit I am sensitive about this topic, so I start becoming extra uncomfortable. This constant bother continues, with him complaining that I am not speaking enough, that I am not smiling etcetera.\n\nI was already uncomfortable at this point. I make a joke to my friend: I see a bed exposed in a shop window, saying I was so tired I would gladly go sleep there. The guy chimes in, commenting that lots of people would surely pay to look at me. My friend scolds him for being a creep and he plays dumb.\n\nLater that night we go to dinner and this guy of course sits in front of me. My friend sits next to me, but with her back directed towards me throughout the whole dinner, so I am forced to interact with this guy, while professors keep teasing me because I am so quiet. My friend even encourages the guy to keep talking to me, despite me previously telling her I was very uncomfortable. In the end the guy asks me to go out together. I refuse, saying I am very busy (at this point I was panicking and I was so stupid not to say I am in a relationship or that I am not interested). He keeps insisting and I keep rejecting him.\n\nFinally the dinner ends, and I am very upset both at him and at my friend for not helping me at all through this uncomfortable situation. The first day we are all back home, he texts me \"how are you\". Ofc I don't reply, since I am still bothered. My friend however tells me I was being too harsh on him.\n\nAITA? I feel like I gave him so many signals that I was not interested and he actively chose to ignore them. On the other side maybe I was not clear enough on not being interested in him.", "created_utc": 1688318040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14otkx0/aita_for_ignoring_a_guy_that_made_me_uncomfortable/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously the asshole here is the overly aggressive man.\n\nFurther, it could be dangerous if you give him more attention when you are not interested. He obviously doesn't get the attention he wants/needs, so you giving him any attention will just make him feel like you are interested. He could easily do something crazy thinking there's something there.

It's ok to just let this go. Maybe block his number.", "This post is a disaster on so many levels.\n\nFirst, you are on a trip with a university group. It is normal (and expected) for you to have normal social interactions with other members of your group. It's very much not OK to exclude a member of your group because he has unusual hobbies. You don't have to be his best buddy, but you owe him normal social politeness.\n\nSecond, you don't owe him your phone number, or a date. Normal social politeness does not require you to give him either, and \"no\" is a complete sentence.\n\nThird, your friend is a complete asshole. She has been flat-out rude to this guy throughout the trip, but then says that you're being too harsh on him for not wanting to go out with him? Your friend needs a serious attitude adjustment. You don't owe this guy a date. You're free to turn him down for whatever reason (including, but not limited, to the fact that you don't enjoy his company, he doesn't share your hobbies, and so on.) But you both owe him basic social civility, and your friend seems to have failed at this.\n\nFourth, the guy is an asshole. He might be a socially awkward guy with odd hobbies, but he needs to understand that a direct \"no\" to a request for a date is the end of the conversation. It is not an invitation to ask again.\n\nFifth, you need to use your words, and speak clearly and unambiguously. Stop \"sending signals\" and assuming that everyone else has the same codebook that you have. It's completely OK to tell someone, politely, that you're not interested in dating them. (And tell them this. Don't give excuses about how you're tired, or busy that night, or whatever else, because a lot of people will hear that as \"I would, but not on this occasion.\" If you're not interested in someone, tell them, in polite but unambiguous language, that you're not interested.\n\nSo ESH, I think.", "NTA\n\nand you are NOT stupid for saying you were busy instead of something else, like you\u2019re already in a relationship or not interested. He should have taken the hint long before it got to that point, and you were being soft with him because he was scaring you; you know men can be dangerous when they\u2019re being rejected, and you were doing what felt safest (so as to not set this weirdo off). \n\nEveryone here failed you. Your \u201cfriend\u201d is NOT your friend. And fuck those professors, too.", "NTA. You need to spoke with him and tell him directly that you dont wanna interact with him because he make you unconfortable.\nIf he keep pushing or your teachers keep teling that you dont Talk to much, you need to anser directly that its because that Guy is make you unconfortable and dont let you alone.", "NTA - It\u2019s your choice who you do and do not want to associate with.", "NTA- and I didn\u2019t need to read your post to know that. You should never ever ever feel bad for recognizing you feel unsafe and conducting yourself accordingly. Women stay alive this way.", "NTA Literally, everyone else in this situation is. Your friend, your professors, and this guy have confused coercion with consent. The way they all handled it is gross.\n\nYou are not obligated to give anyone your time and attention, especially if you are uncomfortable. You are not even obligated to be nice. \n\nYou should not have to be harsh to get this guy to leave you alone, but that's what he is pushing you to do. That's not on you.", "NTA. Block him. In future, don't give out your number and don't be afraid to make a scene when someone is making you uncomfortable. They deserve to be uncomfortable as well and the more eyes on you in these situations the safer you will be.", "NTA you need to tell your teachers he is making you uncomfortable, email them about it too so you have receipts. You need to tell him you are not comfortable speaking with him and for him to leave you alone. Do not be alone with him. Have a buddy system. He is deranged and you are in danger. You need to speak up or it will get worse. \n\nThat is NOT your friend. You need to block his number and file a complaint to the school. Your teachers should not be talking to you like that or making fun of you. Please look into therapy. I am very worried about you. Predators like this guy look for people like you who don\u2019t fight back.", "NTA.  Tell him you are not interested in talking to him or hanging out with him.  Tell him to leave you alone.  Then block him.  You are under no obligation to give anyone your number or your time.  The professor was creepy, this guy was creepy.  \n\nNext time someone is making you uncomfortable, just leave them.  Excuse yourself, say goodbye, and go talk to someone else, just leave their presence.  You told people several times you were uncomfortable.  They didn't care.  It's ok to be \"rude\" to leave uncomfortable situations.  Signals and subtle hints don't work with boundary crushers.  And your friend doesn't seem to be any help either.  Friends have your back.", "NTA,  and your friend is not a friend.  You don't have to make any excuses or have any reason for not engaging someone and I'm horrified on your behalf that your professors were encouraging his behavior. Block them all.", "ESH \u2013 Remember \u201casshole\u201d means \u201cat fault\u201d in this sub. Although you were being kind, giving the guy your number was a huge mistake, as you already had plenty of information on which to judge that he would likely be a problem. Yet you still gave him your number because you didn\u2019t want to cause a scene?! Bad choice, and horrible reasoning, which means you are at fault a small amount.\n\nYour friend is an asshole for not helping you more, especially as the problem arose because you were trying to be nice (to be fair, she did call him a \u201ccreep\u201d when he was coming on to you). Especially at dinner, it seems she was getting her petty revenge for you not following her lead. You missed a middle ground where you could be nicer than your friend, but less nice than you were.\n\nThe guy is obviously the biggest asshole for missing all of the hints you gave him, and generally sounds like a total nightmare. I need not say more here.\n\nETA: I'm faulting you because you are (rightly) complaining about the guy missing clear signals, but giving out your number is a big one. It's also the means by which the problem has extended beyond the class trip.", "YTA\n\nI gotta step in and try to offer a different perspective here. You gave this guy your phone number, and then weakly declined his date request by saying \u2018no, i\u2019m too busy\u2019.\n\nThese \u201csocial cues\u201d you speak of are not a rule. It\u2019s unfair of you to expect somebody to pick up on your \u201csignals\u201d. Be an adult, use your words.\n\nAnd btw, giving somebody your phone number is a \u2018social cue\u2019 and a \u2018signal\u2019 that you are open to the idea of going on a date with this person.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that you were so uncomfortable throughout this whole experience, but IMO you have nobody to blame but yourself. Learn how to speak up, learn how to be direct, and quit being so childish about uncomfortable situations.", "NAH - Except maybe your friend. \n\nYou were definitely not an AH. You were polite but firm with a gentleman who was expressing unreciprocated romantic feelings towards you. You do not owe anyone anything and certainly aren\u2019t expected to date someone you\u2019re not interested in simply because they want you to.\n\nThis guy, while clearly lacking in the social skills department, is also not an AH. He probably should have taken the hint but he at no point was he aggressive with you, he didn\u2019t try to guilt you into dating him, and he didn\u2019t try to force himself on you physically.\n\nYour friend on the other hand sounds like a textbook pot stirrer who \u201chates drama\u201d but always seems to be right in the middle of it.

Once at a school party when a creepy classmate was hitting on one of my friends, all of her friends including me made ways to distract him and distance him from her, as friends should do (making sure she was never alone with him, whenever he tried to talk to her one of our guy friends kept on pulling him aside for conversations, making sure whenever she sat down he couldn't sit next to her). While we did this, it allowed her the time needed to build up her courage to be frank with him and tell him to leave her alone.

That man has NO RIGHT to behave the way he is behaving around you, whether or not you \u201cgave in\u201d. Don\u2019t beat yourself up for saying yes out of discomfort; what you should do now is be as assertive as you can with him in front of the rest of your social circle and reject him. Make it very clear that you feel uncomfortable. If he escalates his creepiness, get an authority involved. Your safety is your top priority.", "NTA.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You did, however, fall into a common trap that a lot of us do when we're younger: being concerned about causing a scene and being nice.  As I've gotten older, it's been easier and easier to just cut people off--not rudely, but decisively.  I've become more confident in brushing people off that I don't want to deal with, whether they're selling something, seeking romance, or what have you.\n\nDon't feel bad: as I said, a lot of us do that, men and women both, but especially women because we're socialized to be very concerned--sometimes overly concerned--about the feelings of others.  I hope you'll use this experience to help you build the confidence to speak up when you're feeling uncomfortable, to push back when it seems like someone is stampeding you to do something you don't want, and to seek out others when someone is breaking your boundaries and you feel like you need help.", "NTA at all, you gave a lot of clear signals that you weren't interested and he kept being an absolute trash can of a person.

I can\u2019t believe about all the people who just zeroed in on the mixed signals part, completely ignoring that you already clearly said no the first time he asked for your number. And then, he waited until your friend left you, to ask for your number again while you were alone. I would have been scared in that situation too, and the ones who say \u201cjust be clear, say no - not interested\u201d have no clue how scary it can be for a woman who is faced with a persistent man who clearly will not take no as an answer. A man, who clearly does not act in accordance to social norms, and a man you don\u2019t know that well, so you don\u2019t know how he would react to rejection.

I don't know how you & your friend couldn't pick up on that. If you knew he already wasn't picking up with you trying to egg shell your way around an answer one of you should've very plainly in a nice but firm way let him know you aren't interested. If he really does struggle with social cues how is it going to read if you already gave him your number, usually that indicated that someone does like another person, & then you said \"no, *I'm busy*. Maybe he just needs to be told straight up \"I'm sorry but this isn't going to work out & respectfully I would like to cut all communication with you\" I don't think anyone is necessarily an AH (except for the one who turned their back on you) but really just a lack of communication all around.", "Knew him in the scrotum", "As a college prof this really struck me: \"Professors jump in on that agreeing that I am extra quiet.\"  so this creeper was sexually harassing you right in front of them and they were agreeing with him-- then later your professors kept teasing you because you were quiet?

But I see now that she did say no and he persisted beyond that.", "thank you, I felt like that was a pretty clear way to say no, but some friends told me i should have said I was not interested bc I am in a relatioship. Tbh he stated multiple times that if he wants something then it is hard to stop him from getting it (he wasn't talking about me but about other situations). This gave me the impression that whatever I said to him wouldn't have stopped him", "This is what happens when women are hounded relentlessly by men who think it\u2019s ok to not take \u201cNo\u201d for an answer. Part of the fault of the professors and people around her just ignoring what was going on. \n\nNext time, OP, have a fake number on hand. I have a Google voice number that I give out to people that are like this guy. If they text it right there, your phone will ping, but it doesn\u2019t track to your phone. A bit annoying that women have to do this, but better than giving out your real cell number.", "To be clear, I\u2019m not defending men who think it\u2019s ok to not take \u201cno\u201d for an answer.\n\nI\u2019m saying that it hasn\u2019t been proven that the guy in the post was that kind of a person, because she wasn\u2019t direct with her words.\n\nShe tried to say no, but in a way that wouldn\u2019t hurt his feelings. She tried to say no, but in a way that didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u201d.\n\nIt isn\u2019t fair to expect somebody to pick up on \u201csignals\u201d. Say what you mean, even if it hurts somebodies feelings.", "She and her friend specifically told him \u201cNo\u201d when he asked for their numbers. It wasn\u2019t until he cornered her later and pressured for her number that she gave it to him. \n\nAgain, no is no. \u201cNo, I\u2019m tired\u201d is still no. \u201cNo, I\u2019m busy\u201d is still no. If she\u2019s interested, she\u2019ll call back. He was a creep when he kept pressuring her after the first \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nI have seen women say no and regretted it (ended in violence). I have seen women say no and have to deal with a creep stalking her. I get why women tread lightly here. And, she did say what she meant. She said and meant \u201cNO.\u201d\n\nEdit: typos", "It seems I overlooked the part where she initially declined to give her phone number, then later gave in after further persistence. She said no. He was wrong to continue on. I still feel it is important to recognize that giving \u201csocial cues\u201d and \u201csignals\u201d is not the same as verbally communicating exactly what you mean. But I see now that she did say no and he persisted beyond that."]}
