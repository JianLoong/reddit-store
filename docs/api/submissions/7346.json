I suggest he watches the videos on his phone, etc. I have tried to find a solution but he still insists.\n\nToday I put my foot down and told him to go sleep in the bed, it\u2019s unreasonable that I have to give up the entire house to him while he sleeps for hours in the afternoon.

So I gave up and told him I would not tiptoe around him and do what I do, making the noise that I make. He was fine with that, and still is, it does not bother him at all that I do stuff while he sleeps. So, that solved the problem really, just do what you want, if he doesn't like it, he can go lie on the bed \ud83d\ude0a", "Fuck...let me get this straight...HE says it's too bright in the bedroom to sleep. HE says he needs TV/videos to sleep. HE doesn't want a TV in the bedroom. HE doesn't want to watch videos on his phone in the bedroom to sleep but YOU'RE accused of being an asshole???!!! Fuck him.\n\nYou are NTA. Personally I would start cooking up a storm and plop my ass ona living-room chair and watch whatever tf I want. Naptime be damned. Other option would be to get a TV in the bedroom for yourself  but still cook while prince charming is napping. How he doesn't see the hypocrisy in him being pissed that he can't \"nap in his own house\" and you not being able to watch tv, use the living room, or cook/ use kitchen in YOUR own house is beyond me \n\nAgain...NTA!", "NTA, his cascading list of preferences can\u2019t hold you hostage.\n\nPlay your video games and cook your food, if he can\u2019t sleep, point to the room made for sleeping in", "NTA.

You have offered up reasonable compromises & he's rejected them all.  If he needs the TV on to sleep, then he should be willing to have one in the bedroom.  He is being totally unreasonable here.", "NTA. Your boyfriend should make some reasonable concessions here. He is monopolizing the common areas of the house with little regard to the others living in it. You made other suggestions that sounded completely reasonable such a tv in the bedroom. The other question here is are you guys actually compatible co-inhabitants? Who owns the home? Are you leasing it together if neither one owns it? I don\u2019t know many people who would be okay with the arrangement of being banished to the bedroom while someone insists on always sleeping in the common areas. I guess part of the question here is if you can\u2019t get past this issue is living together even really working?", "NTA he is being totally unreasonable. If he doesn\u2019t budge, use the house, make noise, go about your business and if it wakes him up oh well. His fault.", "You're not the asshole. It's not unreasonable what you are asking. Have you tried explaining it to him that you are stuck when he takes naps on the couch? You're life can't be on pause because he takes a nap.", "Yeah he is being unreasonable with all his various demands and then effectively leaving you to just use the bedroom NTA", "NTA\n\nYes, he has the right to use the living room - and so do you. Perhaps tell him he can sleep on the sofa with the TV but you're also living there and need to use that space too. If he can sleep through your noise, then.... why not? It's up to him.", "Nta - just watch the video on a laptop or something. Either he goes and sleeps in a bed, I know that sounds crazy... or he sleeps on the couch and accepts you might wake him up. This imo is very reasonable", "NTA - if he'd compromise every once in a while, then sure, you might have been at fault, but he hasn't compromised at all. \n\nBasically, he's the one being unreasonable here.", "I don't see the problem here. He sleeps on the couch and you use the house in any way you want or need to. When you inevitably disturb him, he has the choice of moving to the bedroom to get better sleep or toughing it out were he is.\n\nHe's right, he should be able to take a nap on the couch in his own place, he's just not free from the consequences of choosing a central, well-traveled area to take that nap.\n\nGenuinely don't know how to rate this, since I also think you shouldn't be telling him he can't sleep on the couch, and I don't think bedrooms should have TVs, but I also think he's not grasping the core of the problem. Good luck.", "NTA do what you want since he is being unreasonable.", "Used to have a roommate do this shit. It\u2019s common area so deal with it, if yah want some sleep,  go to the bedroom.

And if he has things showing, why does it prevent you from playing video games?\n\nI say just cook and game anyway, and if he argues you respond \"IT'S RIDICULOUS I CANT COOK IN MY OWN KITCHEN IN MY OWN HOUSE.\"  \n\nEither way NTA because bedrooms are for sleeping and you have a bedroom he can use.", "I can relate to your BFs schedule and the challenges with sleep.

But he could use the radio to listen too.  \n\n\nIf he naps alot, I would send him to the doctors though. I napped a lot, it turned out I was allergic to dairy and it used to make me fall asleep. Caffeine also makes me fall asleep.", "NTA but why do you lock yourself up so he can sleep? If I decide to nap on the couch while my wife is home - she just does whatever she\u2019s doing and I nap through it.  If he\u2019s tired I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll sleep through you cooking and gaming", "Why do you have to hide?

These things require discussion and compromise.", ">I\u2019m going to go about the house as I normally would from now on and point him to the bedroom if he asks me to be quiet.\n\nThat sounds like a great idea.\n\nIt's implausible that the bedroom with blackout curtains is \"too bright\" but the couch with a TV playing plus other ambient light isn't. He's being a selfish AH. At the very least, he's ignoring your wants and needs and turning his problem into your problem. More likely, he's being an AH on purpose, because he has refused any suggested compromise.\n\nMaybe it's a case of, \"I'm not happy, so I'll make sure everyone's not happy.\" Or maybe he's just a natural born AH.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA My ex was a train conductor same issues if not more he did this as well. I work shifts as well so I've understood the fatigue but I prioritize my rest and routine. However, it is inconsiderate to the rest of the functioning house to just sleep in the living at the sacrifice/inconvenience of others being kind (by not cooking, by not playing games etc). My 'days off' would be tipping toeing around downstairs, not baking, not being able to maybe watch a show I would like while cooking etc., not being able to vacuum etc. etc.  I would complain and he would just say you can make noise it doesn't wake me up. (MISSING THE POINT!)\n\nPart of the ongoing fatigue is the broken sleep they suffer. I think it is their responsibility to come up with a routine as well. \n\nTake a shower, get in bed and go to sleep!!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA\n\nI recommend audiobooks, podcasts, or playing music in the bedroom. Also, he can play movies/tv shows on his smartphone or tablet.", "NTA the living room is a communal space and to be shared by everyone in the household.  His hours suck but he wont compramise as you seem to be trying to do.  He can put on ear buds if he likes back ground noise.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s being a ridiculous hypocrite. He doesn\u2019t get to commandeer the whole house to sleep when there\u2019s a perfectly good bedroom available.\n\nLet him buy a tv for the bedroom if that\u2019s the last sticking point. Then if he still won\u2019t compromise\u2026well, it\u2019s your house too. Cook, play video games, whatever.
