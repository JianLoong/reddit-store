You told 2 strangers that you want to watch them have sex as a birthday present. Where's the joke? That lesbians are a porn novelty for your enjoyment? Do you walk up to straight couples and make jokes about wanting to watch them have sex as a birthday gift?\n\nDoubt it. Because you would be worried about getting punched in the face. But it's hilarious because it's 2 women that you're not threatened by? Cool bruh.", "YTA - yikes after they specifically said don't hit on us.", "YTA. Which part of \u201cdon\u2019t hit on us\u201d was confusing?", "YTA", "YTA, you started off by making them feel comfortable enough to joke with you a little and took it too far.", "So you knew it was an old joke. The joke comes from the people in the joke misunderstanding the guy who wanted to perv on lesbians. But the way you're trying to copy the joke, you're making them the characters that misunderstand. So either they don't get the joke, or they've heard it before.

If your defense is \"I was just joking\" then you were being an asshole. In all situations. It's an even older thing than your joke.", "Yeah, YTA. You could have said literally anything else but that, and they would have been okay with it. \u201cTake me to a movie, or dinner\u201d would have been far better than that. You had a friendship building, and we\u2019re gaining trust, and you had to screw it up by making a stupid statement. Not a \u201cjoke\u201d. There wasn\u2019t anything funny about what you said.", "YTA. Jokes like that, ESPECIALLY with people you just met, are not appropriate. It's gross. And do tell, what was supposed to be funny about this? You are coming off as a HUGE creep. I wouldn't ever talk to someone who said something like that to me the night I met them.", "YTA. Joking around with someone who is being nice to you does not give you license to fetishize their sexuality. So gross.", "YTA.\n\n\"As long as you don't hit on us\" = \"I want to watch\" is an ok thing to say to people who you've just met and had clearly set the boundary?\n\nYou know what's a great joke you should use? Super ancient and goes over like a charm every time. When you see a woman out of the kitchen, simply say \"get in the kitchen\".

It's kind of hard to make a complete judgement without being there to read the room, but I would have probably avoided making the joke to be on the safe side.", "They also are extremely sensitive in general..
