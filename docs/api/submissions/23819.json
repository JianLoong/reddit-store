What your girlfriend is doing isn't benign or \"really nice\". It's incredibly offensive to people like me for multiple reasons, starting with the fact that she is literally negating (or at best co-opting and making light of) our experience of illness and disability as something real, debilitating, and not fleeting or subject to the easy fix of her magical thinking. \n\nOn the flip side, many people with less debilitating disabilities find it incredibly hurtful when people like your girlfriend approach them, as strangers, and ask to pray for them, because they don't actually feel that they need \"fixing\". As a medical student you should be aware of this. They want respect, consideration, and equal access to the world around them . . . not for someone to pray \"that they be made whole\" or \"get up and walk out of their wheelchair\". The wheelchair isn't the problem; people like your girlfriend who see them as \"needing fixing\" instead of \"needing to be listened to\" because they use a chair with wheels for mobility are. \n\nAnd those are only two of the endless, myriad reasons why what she's doing is not harmless or okay or sweet.\n\nBut also, it makes me sad because you clearly have lost touch with your own faith. Judaism has always put tremendous emphasis on education, reason, believing that God put us on this earth to use the tools we have access to. There is a reason why a disproportionate number of Nobel Science Laureates have been Jewish. We are not a people of blind faith; it is in fact anathema to our tradition.
