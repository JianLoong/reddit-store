We look for spiders, dig in the mud, and stop at our neighborhood park to play. It's sort of a standing meetup for a bunch of parents in the area.\n\nRecently a new family moved in the next block over. The mother mentioned that she had two boys too, Kyle (13M) and Aiden (7M). I told her about the Sat morning park group in case she wanted to meet some neighbors.\n\nWhen she showed up with Aiden it was clear he has special needs. The mom was friendly, she sat with all the parents while the kids played. Aiden is an enthusiastic player. Loud noises, banging on things, getting up in the other kids faces. The mom was good about correcting him, and he wasn't aggressive, just excited.\n\nThe other kids are wary when he flails, but they include him in play still. One Sat he was having an especially tough day. I called Sam over for a snack. He said \"I don't want to play with Aiden, can we go home?\" So we left. The next day Aiden's mom came to my door. She told me that I should have talked to him about differently abled people instead of just abandoning her son. We agreed to talk to Sam.\n\nThe next weekend Sam said hi to Aiden, they played together a bit, but when Aiden got loud again, Sam retreated to the highest platform where Aiden was scared to go. When Aiden asked him to be his partner for a game, Sam said no thank you. I felt that was fine. My wife still felt bad, so she invited them over.\n\nAiden had one melt down but other than that it went fine. Afterwards Sam asked please could Aiden not come over again. I asked James what he thought of Kyle, he said that the kid was obnoxious and didn't smell great.\n\nThe next weekend, Aiden destroyed my son's favorite toy. He snapped the arms and legs off. Sam yelled \"YOU ARE A VERY MEAN LITTLE BOY!\" I did not make him apologize, we just left.\n\nNow instead of going out in the morning, we go on Sat afternoon after Aiden has left the park. \n\nAfter a few weeks, some others started joining us. We didn't discuss why. But I suspect that they didn't all shift their weekend routine around solely because they missed my sparkling personality.\n\nAiden's mom eventually got wind of it. I don't know how. She wrote us a long heartfelt letter. She felt I had not done enough to discourage Sam from ostracizing Aiden and that my \"pull\" in the neighborhood was influencing others to avoid her son now too.\n\nSam has tried his best. He's verbalized his need for boundaries from Aiden to us three times now. James has also been clear that he doesn't like the brother, Kyle. As long as both of my kids treat them with respect, I'm satisfied. \n\nI can't control what the other parents choose to do. We'll continue to be friendly and be good neighbors if they need a hand, but not play with them.

Every birthday she\u2019s invite all my classmates to these elaborate birthday parties I didn\u2019t want all in an effort to a) safe face and b) force socialization. \n\nI was miserable. There really is nothing more lonely than the people around you essentially being \u2018forced\u2019 to spend time with you. Special needs or not, a kid can pick up on that. And it sucks for all parties involved.\n\nSide note: considering the neurotypical, older son isn\u2019t exactly a social butterfly and popular with your kids either it seems like the mother has certain short comings when it comes to raising them and that\u2019s on her, not you, to fix. Her trying to strong arm and guilt trip you like this is just proof of this.", "I'm sure it's very difficult and heartbreaking for Aiden's mom to watch her child be alienated by his behaviors. She doesn't sound as though she's giving other children the same latitude as her son. \n\nIf you were Aiden's mother I think the only thing to recommend is finding a professional to help her help her child with his off-putting behavior. No one enjoys seeing a friendless child.", "[removed]", "This is such a difficult situation.

I hope the mother can get her child extensive care for his disability.", "NTA your kids aren't being rude, they have put in the effort. It's a hard situation but at the same time they need to be able to have fun and enjoy themselves too and obviously that is not happening. It wouldn't be fair to make them suffer continuously.", "NTA.  Everyone should be polite, but everyone gets to pick their own friends.   And destroying another kids toys is mean.\n\nAnd no one else gets to tell you how to parent", "NTA.... your responsibility is your child and you can accommodate anyone else, disabled or not, to the extent that it doesn't disadvantage your child or put them in an awkward situation. Your kid has already tried to accommodate Kyle and he doesn't like it. Why would you force him? What lesson are you teaching him from that? To accommodate and roll over for things he doesn't want to do in life. Having a disabled kid is hard and that mom is going to have a tough ride.

They are very respectful.  Aiden's mom wishes things were different but blaming you for not doing enough is unacceptable. I've yet to read she replaced the favorite broken toy or intervened in the moment to underscore to Aiden his actions were not acceptable and demonstrate what it.

I applaud you for remaining level headed and giving your kids choices.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s a very difficult situation but you\u2019re doing the right thing in prioritising your child and their enjoyment of that time you share together.\n\nYou gave their friendship multiple chances to develop but you can\u2019t expect a 6 year old to have that much tolerance, and your 12 year old is old enough to choose who he\u2019s friends with. \n\nYou sound like a decent father and it seems like you approached this in the right way.", "NTA.\n\nYour sons have made efforts, they have been respectful as much as they have been able. They have come to conclusions on their own that these other boys are more than they can emotionally handle. Sam has repeatedly demonstrated that he needs space from the younger boy and has established his boundary. \n\nThe other mom is working so hard to socialize her sons, she's doing everything she can to be the best mom she can be and raise the best sons they can possibly be. I wish her and her boys every success. \n\nYou have listened to your sons, heard their boundaries, and recognized their emotional limits.", "NTA. Some parents feel like just because their child is special needs then every single child and adult needs to bend over backwards for them. They end up doing their child a great disservice with the life lessons that accompany it. You and your children have not been rude in the slightest. It\u2019s not your sons\u2019 jobs to be their friends and keep them entertained if they don\u2019t want to be. It sounds like the mother needs to work on social skills with her children.", "NTA. Competing needs are a thing, and the other mother doesn't seem to understand this.", "NHITA.\n\nSpecial Needs teacher here (paraprofessional). There's a little boy in the child care center I look after, I'll call him Will. Will doesn't understand social norms. He often steps too far. He gets clingy with his best friend, who at times doesn't want to be clung to. He takes toys that other kids are playing with.\n\nThe other day, one of the golden children of the center-- call him Ben-- was discussing who he would be inviting to his birthday party. And sitting across from Will, he said, \"I won't invite Will though,\" matter-of-factly. I watched how Will took that quietly but painfully.\n\nI talked to Ben privately and asked him about the reasons he had said that right in front of Will, and he shrugged his shoulders. I asked him if he might have done it to reassure the other kids at the table that Will wouldn't be there to spoil the fun of the day, and his reactions suggested I was dead on. Instead of shaming him, I said, \"I get it. It's hard when your friends don't like another friend. But we should try a different way. Because Will carries around those little hurts, and even though Will can spoil the fun sometimes, we care about him, don't we?\"\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is this: nobody is perfect at navigating this stuff. It's tricky for you, and tricky for Aiden's parents, too, and tricky for the whole community. Aiden's mom can't be 100% on top of him. He has to learn from his mistakes. All you can do is ask Sam to be kind to Aiden's mistakes-- to forgive him, but that he doesn't have to be close to him if he just doesn't like Aiden.", "NAH  \n\n\nMan I was all prepared to whip out some righteous indignation and you took the wind out my sails lol.    \n\n\nSam was kind, polite and used his words to explain when he was uncomfortable and honestly a lot of adults can't manage that, so kudos to you and your wife for raising such a sweet, charming little kid.      \n\n\n  \nI feel for Aiden's mom.   She knows exactly what happened and why it happened and it's got to be devastating.     She's reaching out to you for help and it doesn't sound like she's been overly demanding or rude about it, unless you left something out.     She's going to have find a way to navigate this over the next decade, and it's going to suck.       \n\n\nJust continue to be kind and polite, and encourage Sam to be kind and polite and use his words.    There's no villains in this story, just a lot of sadness.", "NAH. It doesn\u2019t sound like your sons did anything disrespectful. I think it\u2019s good to teach your sons that they are not obligated to be around people who cross their boundaries. I\u2019m glad that you listened to them and honored their wishes. \n\nI can understand from the perspective of the mom with a disabled son, that they are new to the neighborhood and she wants her kids to make friends and feel included. She is in a difficult position and must advocate for her son, but also needs to respect the wishes and decisions of other neighborhood kids and parents.", "NTA and I\u2019m starting to have some challenging experiences myself. My daughter is so shy it\u2019s almost crippling. We do our best to get her out of this, play football every Saturday and there are a couple of special needs children, one is much older and physically capable but needs to be in a younger class. Clearly it\u2019s good for those with special needs to be included and I never thought anything of it until my daughter stopped wanting to play. She gets scared by the random outbursts and is too young to understand why it happens. She has gotten physically hurt sometimes, nothing more than accidental pushes but one father got smashed in the face and did a sterling job of not swearing in front of everyone. Physically this child is just more aggressive and stronger than all the other children and it\u2019s not his or the parents fault.\n\nSuddenly something I had been very supportive of was now changing in my mind. We are going to football this week but I\u2019m very close to giving it up for my daughters sake which would feel like a failure to me but I don\u2019t know what else to do.", "NAH. I feel for literally everyone in this story. \n\nI feel for your son, because I still remember being forced to interact with unpleasant kids when I was a child, and I hated it. It ruined my day, I felt on edge the whole time, it sucked. And it never made me accept the other kid, it just drilled into me how much I didn\u2019t like them. \n\nI feel sorry for Aiden because he can\u2019t help it. I feel sorry for Aidens mum because I cannot imagine the feeling of seeing your child be ostracised and just wishing everyone else cared about your child as much as you do, so they would do anything to make them happy. Cannot fucking imagine it and I would not wish a special needs child on any parent. \n\nBut you have tried, and as you say, you son has set down boundaries and does not want to play with Aiden. Unfortunately, at some point, that\u2019s that.", "NTA - Be polite as possible but no one should have to spend time with anyone they don't want to.", "NAH, for all the reasons the other replies have mentioned, so I won't repeat them.\n\nCurious--did you respond to the mother's letter? I think it would be worth laying out your thoughts here to her. I think it would be good letting her know you really feel for her and Aiden's struggles, but ultimately you have to respect your own kids' boundaries and it isn't working out right now. \n\nSomething just occurred to me-- if you wanted to try giving this just one more shot, would it be possible to try another supervised play date at Aiden's house, with both you and his mom present? Plus then Aiden can only break his own toys.\n\nIf not, I would consider possibly revisiting the play dates when Aiden is a little bit older. Right now he's having some problems with regulating, but in a couple years he might have better coping strategies, or your own kiddos could have built up a bit more of a tolerance to kids getting in their faces, who knows.\n\nMan, this is a tough one. I really feel for you all.", "NTA - your son is a 6 year old boy, he shouldn't be expected to have the maturity of an adult. He should be allowed to pick who he wants to be friends with .", "You're not excluding him based on disability.  NTA", "Nta.\n\n I feel for Aiden but his mother lost my sympathy the moment she tried to blame other people for her son's social limitations. It is her job to help Aiden adjust to social situations. Other kids are not obligated to feign friendship with a boy they simply do not enjoy playing with. It's a harsh reality for Aiden and Mom - but a reality nonetheless.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing what's right for your kids. Just because some other child is special, doesn't mean you are required to accept every wrong thing they do. \n\nYour kids gave them several chances, and they set their boundaries. You should be proud they did it in such a polite way.\n\nUnfortunately, her kid needs more professional help than what you can or should provide. She needs to teach her kid that it is not ok to act like he did. And accept that others have different boundaries. I'm sorry for her kid, but she needs to keep him under a closer care if he's constantly going over another's boundaries. Perhaps enroll him on a inclusive school, where he'll learn it without his mother been able to excuse his behavior, with the help of professionals. \n\nYou are not responsible for what your neighbors do or don't do. You don't control their schedules. It's not on you they reached their limits and decided to not be close to her kid anymore.", "NTA I think you handled it perfectly", "NAH\n\nI really sounds like you did as much as you could. Your children also seemed to be patient and polite, which is a testament to how you\u2019ve raised them. It\u2019s okay to not want to spend time with people who upset you, regardless of *why* they upset you. It may not be Aiden\u2019s fault that he has trouble socializing, but it\u2019s not your kids\u2019 fault that his behavior makes them uncomfortable or that he breaks their property either. My heart goes out to those kids and their parents. I can only imagine how frustrating it must be; but at the end of the day, you can\u2019t *force* your kids to be friends with people they don\u2019t want to be friends with.", "NAH - I don't think anyone is being an asshole here. \n\nA lot of people here are being very judgemental (which OP is not) and advocating ostracising this kid, which is effectively what is happening.\n\nIt is a tough situation, because we want the best for our kids, but I don't think speaking to Sam about excluding Aiden agains would be doing him a disservice. Cutting short play sessions could be a better solution than letting him cut the kid off. I think Sam would benefit from spending time with Aiden, kids do need to state and restate boundaries.", "NAH, but...\n\nIf you would like to further include this family there may be other activities you can do without alienating your own kids. It's possible that the park group is not the best environment for all of the kids to enjoy themselves and for Aiden to be his best self, it just happens to be how the group connected.\n\nIt's worth a discussion with Aiden's mom and sharing that Sam and Aiden have had a difficult time getting along at the park meetups. Does she have any ideas for other activities that might be more fun for all of the kids? Maybe Aiden loves for example bowling and everyone can enjoy that (in parallel). \n\nRegardless of what happens between the kids, there's also an opportunity here for valuable lessons for your kids in empathy (not sympathy). These are lifelong skills that will benefit them in school, in work, in relationships. Spending more time discussing how they felt about spending time with Aiden, letting them reflect on how things are from Aiden's perspective.\n\nI'm not suggesting you should force them to be friends or that it will teach empathy. But it is important to learn to be accepting of others with differences and think from others points of view.", "I was done with this fucking kid even before he destroyed the toy. You\u2019re not obligated to be anyone\u2019s friend and neither is your son. He gave an honest effort. Put the kid in a freaking special home or something.", "NTA but not good either. It\u2019s easy to protect and remove our kids from things that make them feel  uncomfortable. It is hard to teach them compassion and patience. My cousin was severely handicapped and he taught us all to be kinder than normal, be more forgiving, be more loving. So when we moved next door to an autistic child, there was a lot of conversations. About what he may not understand and the different challenges he may be facing. After some time, my girl was the first non relative or caregiver that he hugged. It was a big deal and she takes a huge pride in looking after him now. He is non verbal but they communicate. Sometimes we have to leave early but that\u2019s because she is needing space, not because he is too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They also get to have age appropriate boundaries. \n\nForcing them to be around another child they don't like is going to do nothing but cause resentment and could lead to an even worse outcome of bullying to get away from the situation. I'm not saying your kids would, just that this has been known to happen many times in the past to many different people. \n\nI am sorry the mom is struggling, but she has to understand that it is up to her to help her son understand that some people just aren't going to be interested in being friends. That others don't like having their things broken. And she needs to be aware enough to remove her son when he is pushing other kids too far with no personal space, loudness, and breaking things. It is what would most likely help him learn that if he keeps doing things that others find hurtful, he has to leave and go home. Mom isn't doing him any favors.", "NTA. Your first priority is to make sure your son feels safe. It sounds like you have done nothing to ostracise Aiden, but it's an unfortunate fact that Sam and other kids don't like playing with him.

You don't owe her any kind of explanation, Her son requires specific needs and attention, yes -- but she cannot expect every child to know what that means let alone know how to interact with Aiden, they're just kids. \n\nSure as parents, you can teach our kids right from wrong and there times some kids and people need different type of attention and care.\n\nBUT it does not seem like your kids took one look at aiden and refused to play and interact with him. It took a couple of interactions and your kid expressed clearly that he did not want to play with aiden.\n\nIt's just a sucky situation, because forcing your kids to hang out with aiden just for his benefit its not gonna turn out well.

Often the responsibility was on me to find ways to separate them without making his sister feel that she had done anything wrong. \n\nMy kiddos were able to spend quality time comfortably because my son loves watching others play video games.  That was always the calm special time for them growing up and still as adults.", "I feel bad for the mom but I think she\u2019s placing way to much expectations on you and the neighborhood at large. It\u2019s like she expects you to force a relationship between her kid and yours.", "As an autistic person, Aidan sucks.

If you respond to this mother, I would start with your second-to-last paragraph that you\u2019ve written here: \u201cSam has tried his best . . .\u201d", "NTA.  In fact, you WOULD be the asshole if you demand your kids continue to spend time with others who are mean to them.  \n\nI think your kids did exactly the right thing- they tried to include Aiden in the group.  They did not discriminate against him because he's disabled.  They gave him a solid chance, several in fact.  \n\nSo right now you have two choices.  You can order Sam and James to play with Aiden and Kyle, basically telling them that they don't get to choose who they hang out with or who they are friends with.  IMHO, that's the wrong lesson.  \n\nOr you can respect their requests, and as a side effect Aiden doesn't get played with as much.  \n\nPersonally I'd do both-- I'd talk to Sam and James, and basically try to push some empathy- point out that Aiden can't always control his own actions, that he does bad things because he doesn't have the ability to stop, so it's probably pretty lonely for Aiden when kids don't want to play with him.  But, it's important that they understand now that it's THEIR choice who their friends are, nobody (not even you) should ever DEMAND friendship.  Friendship is given, not taken.  \nThen let them make their own choice.  \n\nAs for Aiden's mom- write her back.  Tell her you sympathize with her situation and with Aiden very much, and you can't imagine how hard it is for her, and you want to help her if you can.  But at the same time, you can't force your own kids to be friends with hers.  You have taught them to treat everybody with respect, as you feel that's an important lesson, but you also feel that personal agency is important for a child to learn, especially when it comes to friendships.  You'd like it very much if the boys were friends, but you don't feel it's right to force Sam and James to pretend to be friends with Aiden as you feel that would just make Sam and James resent Aiden.  That's not the situation you want to create.", "NAH and I would definitely miss your sparkling personality lol", "I can't tell YTA vs NTA.\n\nIs there any way that you set some rules before play dates with Aiden? Like not bringing your own toys, telling Aiden's mom that your son is tired before leaving, etc.\n\nBc I agree that your son shouldn't have his things damaged. However I also think that this may teach your son that avoiding disabled people is ok because they're different", "NTA. Aiden's mom is acting on the belief that other children should put her child's needs before their own and that's just not Ok.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like Sam went through the wringer trying to accept this boy. He shouldn't be forced to play with kids he doesn't like. What kind of message would that send??? That Aiden's feelings are more important than Sam's? I feel bad for Aiden's mother, but she needs to be realistic.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou aren't an AH for respecting your son's wishes not play with the special needs child.\n\nBut you and the other parents are assholes for going out of your way to avoid the park when a special needs child is there.\n\nWhat is this teaching children?  That they can't share the same air as a person with a disability??? So he's different and loud. You said he isn't aggressive.  And if your son doesn't like him, he doesn't have to play with him.  And you shouldn't force your son to play with him. But to avoid the park altogether is all sorts of wrong. Not just for the horrible shunning of a child with a disability. But because you're teaching your son to avoid instead of how to advocate for himself when someone makes him uncomfortable.  \n\nSo this kid broke your son's toy.  Since you said that the child is not aggressive, he might have broken it accidentally, due to a fine motor issue for example.  If the child did not have a disability and broke your son's toy, would you be shunning him?  Toys breaking in play is not an unusual scenario.  So it just seems like a massive over reaction.  Again, your son does not have to play with this boy. But shunning him seems like a very bad message to send and does not reflect well on human compassion.", "So it's okay that the play group has noticeably shifted away from when Aiden is there? I just don't know how to fix it in a way that isn't unfair to someone.", "That's exactly what my wife said. She respects our boys autonomy to choose their friends, but she feels terribly for this mom who is just trying her best.", "I really appreciate your perspective on this. I read it to my wife and she teared up, so thank you. I agree. Aiden is a smart kid, and he's sweet too. I can't imagine that he doesn't pick up on at least some of the discomfort. \n\nWith the older boy, I'm not 100% sure if he's just a socially awkward basement gamer type guy, or if there's a mild issue with him too. My older son is way more extroverted than my younger and not at all picky about his friends, so if he says this boy is a drag to be around, it must be pretty rough.", "I think she does have him in quite a few programs. This is 100% my own speculation but  the dad seems to work quite long hours so I think maybe they're paying for a lot more out of their own pocket too. I can't fault the mom for how she handles him, and I don't really know what she could do aside looking for a special needs specific play group? She just really wants her kid to be accepted here in this community too, which I get.", "I had to deal with this too! I\u2019ve questioned for years over whether I was just an asshole little kid but reading this puts it in different perspective for me. \n\nAt ages 6-8 I was forced to be friends with a girl in my grade. She was special needs and I always tried to be nice to her in class, but her parents got wind of it and started inviting me over and getting her invited over to my house. I never had a choice in any of this. She would only eat bologna sandwiches on white bread with the crusts cut off, and I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything else when I ate with her. I can\u2019t even count the times she would get in my sisters\u2019 faces to steal a toy or not let them into a room IN THEIR OWN HOUSE and make them cry. My parents would always try to laugh it off or just ignore me. I don\u2019t know if they were just that oblivious or they just wanted to feel good about what they thought of as kindness.\n\nI totally get trying to be nice to everyone and teaching your kids to be understanding of special needs, but those 3 years were ridiculous. Kids should have the right to choose their friends and feel safe.", "I grew up in a similar situation. But the difference with me, however, I came to find out my parents where bigots (e.g. never allowed to hangout with anyone that wasn't white) and they were always scheming to get money out of some rich family. Freaking kids are going to figure this out sooner or later. They aren't as stupid as my parents think.", "Right? Forcing interaction isn\u2019t a good way to foster empathy. In fact, it\u2019s a good way to foster resentment.", "I really appreciate that. I've been feeling badly because the other parents have followed our lead (not with discussion or anything, I can only assume why) so I do get why the mom feels like everyone has abandoned them.", "Have to agree, NAH in this situation \n\nYou fostered an opportunity for them to engage, but its not just the younger brother your sons don't like.\n\nAlso, him breaking the toy should've been brought up to his mother. He's still learning also, and he's learning on a different path than most are used to, but ignoring that action wasn't really the best move imho. \n\nHowever, I can understand why she feels the way she feels.", "Competing needs, I like the way you framed that. Thank you.", "Special needs mom here, sitting in a parking lot waiting for school to finish.  I cried reading your response to Ben.  Thank you for your caring heart.  \n\nAs for OP, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.  Sometimes some of us are dealt difficult hands.  I would just add that maybe if the moms in the neighborhood have a get together at night to maybe issue an invitation.  It\u2019s a lonely life.", "That's where I'm stuck. We are a tight community who often watch each other's kids, have barbeques, etc. If a whole block was participating in something that I couldn't join, I'd feel like shit too, even if it wasn't intentional.", "You articulated it really well here. No answer really feels fair to everyone. I hope you find something that works for your daughter, it's awesome that you at least gave football a try.", "Appreciate it. We haven't yet. She hand delivered the letter to us, and said that she apologized for the format but she was very emotional and felt it was an easier way to express herself. Totally get it, it's a hard thing to articulate.\n\nWhen she delivered the letter we were a little taken back, she stopped by in the middle of dinner, but we were friendly, we thanked her and said we'd read it, take some time to think and get back to her. We haven't replied past that yet.\n\nShe did request a private play date in the letter for the younger boys, as well as asking for James to come over and game with her oldest, who apparently really liked him the two times they hung out. Both boys were hard no's. Sam is uncomfortable even walking past Aiden's house right now, and James loves to bike and be active, he isn't a big gamer and thinks Kyle is obnoxious. (He kinda is). We did lend Kyle a spare bike so they could go riding together and hopefully find some common ground, but he apparently complained the whole time and they cut the ride short.\n\nAnother commenter suggested at least doing an adults only meeting instead, which I like. We can at least explain our position and hopefully mend the adult relationship, she lives on the street and we don't want her feeling unwelcome here. Maybe we can revisit the kid's relationships down the road when everyone is a bit older.", "I think compassion and patience can be taught without forcing a child to spend time around people they don\u2019t want to be around, after being explicit they didn\u2019t want to be around them, and especially going through the experiences of having your property/toys broken by them. \n\nI also think OP would be disrespecting the boundaries and opinions his kid is trying to set. He doesn\u2019t want to play with Sam. He\u2019s also not obligated to be friends with someone because they\u2019re autistic, out of a sense of guilt (as in, I should be friends with them BECAUSE they\u2019re autistic, vs I should be friends with them because I like them and enjoy being around them, and oh unrelated, they happen to have autism).", "Well put. Where I'm struggling most is that a number of other parents have also shifted over to playing in the afternoon as well. I didn't ask them to (aside from one friend who texted saying his son missed mine, so I did let him know that we attend in the afternoon now if he wanted to catch up). So this nice, well meaning woman brings her kid to the meet up I invited her to, probably feels excited about finding a community, and then I disappear shortly after and most of the others do too. That has to feel like a conspiracy of sorts, even if it wasn't a plot to avoid her or her child, just parents individually making a choice. \n\nWe've known most of the other parents for years, we've babysat, done emergency hospital runs, bailed water out of flooded basements. This poor lady moves into the middle of it with a tough situation and unfortunately now probably feels so defeated.", "I agree. I want my sons to both be kind, tolerant people who include others. Putting them in a bubble and not allowing them to feel discomfort and grow through it, doesn't solve anything. \n\nBut I also don't want them to feel that their choices don't matter, or to not trust their mom and I to respect their wishes when reasonable. It's tough.", "Unless you formally run the playgroup and have informed parents of a shift in time and location- purposefully leaving their family out then NAH. I have run a playgroup before and had to make these kinds of announcements about changing dates/location- doesn't sound like what is happening here.

It\u2019s not your duty to ensure Aiden has friends. There are other kids out there who will befriend him and be cool with his play style.", "That's called the consequences of actions. Aidan's mom could do better to handle him and instead of doing that she just blames everyone else. \n\nMy younger brother is severely autistic and will never live on his own. Everyone loves him because he's a sweeatheart. He flails his arms and hands, he makes noises, and yet he's not annoying. \n\nAidan's mom can shove it.", "I think its fine because nobody did it to be evil", "You didn\u2019t call your neighbors, and tell them what you were doing.

No one is obligated to be friends. \n\nNTA", "I wonder if Aiden\u2019s mom was too pushy with the other parents and maybe that\u2019s why they have been avoiding her?? You\u2019re kids were respectful and everyone included him until he broke toys. That kid was not being ostracized but some parents personality\u2019s ostracize their own kids. Outbursts can be common due to sensory issues but a lot of people on the spectrum or not can have them. The positive is that you handled this so well and your son was able to communicate his feelings productively. Your son is not bad for separating himself if anything you can teach your kid that if he\u2019s uncomfortable or needs a timeout that it\u2019s perfectly fine to take space and how to have a dialogue with other kids.", "Super happy to help! It infuriates me that this woman made you question your and your wives parenting because from what you've written, your sons are perfect gentlemen and on their way to becoming wonderful men one day. \n\nIt's not easy being neurodivergent, so I definitely feel for Aiden, but it's not helped by forcing anyone into being his \"friend\". My mother tried to no avail. I only started to become better once I met my childhood friends who CHOSE to be with me, one in particular who is by my side to this day. \n\nShe really changed me and helped me on my journey to becoming the (mostly) well-adjusted person that I am today. Not because she did anything crazy, really. She mostly just watched me play, because \"I love the stories you make up and your enthusiasm!\"\n\nTo this day, this is the most meaningful thing anyone has ever said to me. What others saw as a grievance, she genuinely saw as an asset! She loved that I was loud and imaginative and knew what I wanted to do. And one day Aiden will meet HIS person as well, it's just quite obvious that Sam isn't it.\n\nAgain, I can't stretch this enough, your boys are little miracles. I WISH the kids back then had been as kind and compassionate and eloquent as your kid is at 6. I also very much respect you guys for hearing him out and respecting his boundaries.

I\u2019m so darn picky with people, I drive myself nuts", "Yeah, I get it too.\n\nWhat I was poorly trying to convey is other kids in the neighborhood could have developmental issues as well.  Perhaps even regressing due to interactions.\n\nI really feel bad for both of them. Any possibility of just doing one on one conversation with mom?

It\u2019s likely there are other special needs children in the area that may be a better fit for her son. Not to say her son has to be siloed - but it\u2019s ultimately up to every individual.", "I think neighborhood-wide events like BBQs are different than forced interactions between your kids and hers. Your kids can interact respectfully with her kids and other kids during neighborhood events and not be stuck playing with them 1:1 for an extended period of time.", "I didn't have enough space to include it in the main post, but the mom did ask for something similar  in her letter. She asked if we could have the boys get together again at one of our houses so they could mend the rift, and she also mentioned that Kyle wanted to spend more time with James and talks about him all the time. We definitely don't want to do that.\n\nI like your idea to have an adults only conversation instead, to at least explain our position and make sure she understands she is not disliked, always welcome to ask for help if she needs something, etc. It will be emotional, especially for my wife, but at least we can feel sure that we communicated as best as possible. Good call.", "Yeah I wanted to comment this myself. I don't think you were an a****** for removing your kids from a situation they didn't want to be a part of after being respectful and giving it multiple attempts.

He basically has no inside voice, and will \"hit play\" when playing as a super hero or something of that nature. His younger brother is just an obnoxious child who likes to push buttons and not listen. Put them together and you have some of the hardest kids to deal with as a parent. I wish I was kidding but they really do push our limits some days.\n\nI would not blame parents for switching times to not be around my kids, they are a handful and sometimes too much for someone. My oldest especially when he gets overwhelmed. Not every kid has to be friends, and being forced to can create more anger towards the kid in question and possibly ostracize them more in the process.\n\nI have had this kind of happen before. Used to live in an apartment complex and the neighbor kids got into the habit of asking if my kids could come play, cuz I was the free babysitter and I didnt mind making sure they stayed out the road while they kicked a ball or played tag ya know. They had a great time, loved hanging out with my kids. The girls across the street are a different story however. The youngest girl was just shy but warmed up, but after they played a couple times, the oldest started to treat my oldest differently. My oldest doesnt talk \"normally\". He repeats phrases, says my name is X (not putting his name here) and will just not talk in a typical fashion when spoken to. The oldest girl started asking why my son was talking like that and when we explained his autism she didnt seem to understand. And started to just avoid him from then on. Its was disheartening to see tbh... But it was her choice. My kid isnt gonna click with everyone and he takes a bit more patience to understand some days more than others. \n\nSo I can understand where you are coming from, but please try to explain why the child is different but not in a patronizing way so that your son understands that sometimes there are others like us that are just different in their own way. The way I explain it is that my son is just like you and me, just sometimes he needs help with his words and emotions.", "As a side note - please don't say \"differently abled\".

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s sad for the mom to watch her child struggle to connect with other kids, but his behavior sounds startling and frustrating, and that tends to drive other kids away. Ultimately you weren\u2019t rude, you were putting your own kid and his comfort, feelings, and safety first, which is what you should be doing. Your child is not required to be friends with this child or any other child for that matter, and his mother reaching out like that was inappropriate.", "NTA.

Its unfortunate that your decision to keep your son comfortable during his playtime ended up with parents joining you, (its not like you told them, they were probably just not getting along with the new family either), and causing Aidens mom to blame you.\n\nPerhaps write her a letter back/talk to her that your intentions weren't to start anything, but you were simply listening to what your son was telling you? He was never mean to Aiden, he simply expressed his discomfort. Forcing kids to get along never ends well. \nHaving a special needs kid can be incredibly tough but the mom also needs to make sure she doesn't brush off any bad behavior from Aiden.

And parenting is also about teaching your children consent & their right to refuse those who make them feel unsafe, unhappy or who don\u2019t listen to boundaries. \nIt is heartbreaking to see & must be so hard for the mum as she probably sees this a lot but as others have said she needs to employ different techniques to manage him behaviour because crossing fingers & hoping he grows out of it isn\u2019t working.", "I don\u2019t think your are an AH but I\u2019m just a bit sad your son isn\u2019t more open minded. It has a lot to do with education and maturity so maybe if he were a bit older, he could compromise (like going once in a while and playing with Aiden).\nI\u2019ve seen kids judged and ostracized for very small things, but I also saw children helping each other.\nThe line is thin.\nMaybe discussing with the mom (especially your wife who seems sympathetic) could already be helpful. She probably needs support, but she will surely understand if you explain that your son was not feeling could. And supporting her by being her friend might also open future opportunities when you Mr son is older and maybe more able to accept the difference.\nI think being confronted to others who are different is great for children (and adults) as you learn to be more tolerant and accepting, and very often can appreciate how lucky you are.\nI saw some of your comments and you seem like a nice guy so hopefully you can be friendly with this family without putting pressure on your own son.\nGood luck to you and to them!\n\ud83d\udc96", "NTA. Your son was not malicious to aiden and he is also a child. Your son shouldn\u2019t have to play with someone who makes him uncomfortable.", "ESH - What did any of the adults do to actually do to explain Aiden's differences to the other kids, help them try and understand his behavior, learn what to do when he's having a meltdown, when they can expect the adults to step in and help, or what consequences are in place for inappropriate behavior like breaking toys?  You all just put them together and expected the kids to figure it out.  Teach them and help them learn how to interact with others who are different from them.  Instead you've all taught these kids that it's ok to ostracize someone who is different.", "Thank you, truly. It's very helpful to have a reply from a professional. As a parent it's hard not to feel like a failure sometimes, no one has all the answers. \n\nMy wife and I will be having some thoughtful conversations about how we can implement some of the tactics you used.", "Sam has clearly expressed his dislike of Aiden. Aiden destroyed his favorite toy. Aiden stresses him out.", "just a heads up, whichever you say first of the two judgements is what reddit will read ur judgement as. add spaces between the letters so you don\u2019t accidentally have the judgement counted as y t a if you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re ta or not.", "Or you teach him that his feelings don\u2019t matter. That his own discomfort with a person should be ignored.", "if you read some of OPs comments his son was actually surprisingly patient and calmly expressed his boundaries multiple times but would then get overwhelmed. It doesn\u2019t sound to me like the son is judging the other kid or that he is uncomfortable because aiden is different, it sounds like OPs son is very shy and gets overwhelmed when things are super loud an in his face which is totally valid.", "Aiden ruined his favorite toy. There\u2019s by reason for that.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to put what the other parents are doing on OP\u2019s shoulders. And I don\u2019t think any of it is inherently based on the fact that the kid has autism. In fact, I think you\u2019re making a stretch for your claims on it teaching kids \u201cthey can\u2019t share the same air as a person with a disability.\u201d It also sounds like OP has talked to their son about playing with differently-abled people. No one is required to be friends with someone else due to a trait \u2014 including people not being required to be friends with someone because of their autism. I also can\u2019t imagine how that would feel on the other end, knowing that someone is only friends with you because you\u2019re autistic and not being friends \u201clooks bad\u201d/or only being friends because you\u2019re autistic and not because they genuinely enjoy being around you.", "OP isn't shunning anyone, he is respecting the wishes of both his children to not play with either child.  Don't they have the right to decide if they want to play with someone or not?  The boys aren't even being mean about it they just don't hang out at the park when the other boys are there.", "Not going to the playgroup IS advocating for himself. Sam is upset by Aiden\u2019s screaming and ruining his favorite toy. The only way to avoid that is not to be around him.", "If everyone has started avoiding their family, I don't think the problem is the people, especially after putting the effort to try and include them, I get that they struggle with their issues and I can't judge if they are doing right by their kid or not. What I can tell you is that forcing relationships is only gonna end up badly, especially at this age and when they are at school without the proper supervision.", "Don't force your kid to accept anyone who disrespect them. My mother did that when a cousin punched me and attacked me. I remember it until today and I have problems with boundaries. I can't explain how much it affected my entire life. Please respect what your son want.", "Your not responsible for what the other parents do. I bet they\u2019ve done the same because their kids have also expressed the same thoughts as your child.  Good for you for listening to your children and respecting their wishes that\u2019s a awesome thing parents should do.", "Obviously, your son is not the only kid who is tired of Aiden's behavior.  His mom needs to do a better job parenting him.\n\nEverything you described is exactly as it should have been handled.  Sam gave Aiden more than one chance.  You raised him to be respectful.  And when it was clear Aiden was ruining Sam's Saturday ritual with you, you shifted to avoid being in the park at the same time.  \n\nYou are definitely NTA.  Don't let anyone make you feel like you are.  Your kid is just as important as hers.", "This is the least unfair solution.", "I doubt, just as much as you do, that the independent decisions of these groups of people was built around trying to spend more time with you. I'm sure you're great but you're not the social darling of the neighborhood and realistically this is a bunch of parents coming to same conclusion.\n\nAnd yeah that's awkward, but it's no specific person's fault. These parents are just trying to do their best as well.", "It's okay and it's not your responsibility. You didn't rally to troops to exclude a little boy just to be mean. You're not making decisions for the group. You adapted your schedule because your son was upset. It may be cold but your children are your priority. Of course you're kind to other kids but not at the expense of your own. Sam and James were very clear. It doesn't sound like there's any bullying going on or they don't like them simply because they're different. It's a response to specific actions. I'd be interested in the high points of the letter she sent.\n\nIt's not fair that Aiden was born with these challenges and not everyone is happy with every outcome. Maybe if the kids were older it would be better but you'd be asking your son to do something that may be beyond his level of development. As adults we can understand the difficulties and make allowances but Sam is six. All he knows is the boy scares/startles him sometimes and broke his toy. If you force him to be around Aiden he'll feel abandoned. Kids don't like shots either but you can at least explain the benefit in terms they'll understand. There is no benefit to Sam and for a 6-year-old their altruism has limits. He'll just think you're putting him at the mercy of someone who scares him and breaks his toys. He's not going to understand that.\n\nI'm sorry for the boy. Maybe he's at the limit of his control, but maybe not. That's why I'd like to know about the letter because that is a clue as to how his mother is handling it. Is Aiden getting all the help he needs both in the home and from professionals? Maybe this would be a blessing if he's not. It may motivate the parents to have him in the best surroundings to make the most progress he can. Too often parents can be so accustomed to their kids that they don't see the situation from the outside. You know the ones-absolute brats that are Mommy's little angel. Not the case here but maybe his behavior is so normalized to her she sees no need for improvement and expects the rest of the world to make accommodations. And we should, of course, but only as we're able and that may be beyond your boys' capability at their ages. But for his own good and his future Aiden's mom needs to make sure he's making as much progress as possible.", "If her kids make both of your kids uncomfortable then unfortunately it's very likely other moms in your neighborhood are getting the same feedback. 7 can be a tough age for any child, I'm sure she is doing her best. But it may be time for her to find some play groups that better fit their needs. Not saying she can't still go to parks but being around similar minded children and parents would do them both some good. When your child says \"I'm not comfortable with this person\", you listen. That's how you set a good precedent and foundation for the future. Yall gave it a shot 3 times, your child is still uncomfortable, you're doing the only right thing by validating how he feels and keeping some distance.", "The logical assumption would be that the other children have likely voiced similar opinions as your son. No well-adjusted child is going to want to play with a kid that has violent meltdowns and destroys other kids\u2019 toys, and no proper parent is going to force that on their kid. You did nothing wrong.", "What does Aiden\u2019s mom do when Aiden acts inappropriately or damages things?", "I get the sense she\u2019s wrapped up in the younger kid that she\u2019s not really paying attention to what is happening with her older one.\n\nBut that could be my own biases.", "It's a known thing in certain circles of the disabled and/or neurodivergent community. It doesn't mean anyone's wrong, just that our needs are different!

You did 100% the right thing for your child, it is NOT your fault this\nMother is refusing to help her child learn how to socialize without harming other kids.", "There is no fair solution, but you\u2019re doing the right thing and teaching your sons their autonomy matters.  That\u2019s the first step in teaching them that others\u2019 autonomy matters.", "It unfortunate that this is how everything came to be, but again for her to single you out as like the ringleader is uncalled for. And I don't think you should take all the blame or feel responsible for the actions of other parents. You're right you cannot control what other parent's do. \n\nBut bottom line is that she cannot project her worries onto you and your family. That is not okay. I think her attention should be on making an effort to be part of the community than to place pointing fingers as to why some parents are at the park at different times.", "Thank you OP for not forcing another hang out, particularly with your youngest who is clearly extremely uncomfortable around this child. As someone who was forced into a similar situation as a child, I look back and wonder why my own parents wouldn\u2019t respect my feelings or protect me in favor of hurting the feelings of someone else. I posted a separate response, but once again,  you\u2019re doing the right thing and showing your child you care about and respect them by allowing them to set boundaries and listening to them.", "\nAn adults meeting is a great idea. I really hope you guys can work it out and that one day Aiden finds his people.", "Thank you for not forcing your kids to hang out with people they feel nervous around. I do feel for the mom and her family, but allowing kids to pick who they spend their time with is a big deal. It teaches them to listen to their gut and keeps them safe in more complicated social situations as they get older.\n\n(Also, NAH - this is just a complicated situation all around. I hope everyone finds people who uplift them.)", "And what\u2019s your point? Suggestions of discussing empathy with a kid are therefore invalid? The two kids can\u2019t even coexist in the same environment?", "I specifically said that OP's child should NOT be forced to play with a child with a disability.  But OP said that he is purposely avoiding the park when he knows the child with a disability is playing -- that is an over the top and gross reaction to not wanting to share the same space as a person with a disability as if their disability is a viral illness. He's an asshole for going out of his way to avoid this child.  \n\nI knew that I would get slammed for my opinion but I stand by it.", "[removed]", "No, the other mother is for sure an asshole. 100% an asshole. I say this as the mother of an autistic child, it is NEVER okay to use your child\u2019s disability as an excuse for them overriding everyone else\u2019s boundaries and being destructive and mean.\n\nIs being a special needs parent tough? Damn right it is. But it does NOT give you the right to put your child on a pedestal and make everyone else suffer just because you refuse to teach your child boundaries. This mother is failing their child immensely by acting as if he can do no wrong and others should just accept him because he\u2019s different. \n\nMy son gets loud at times, and there are times other kids want to avoid him. I 100% respect the other kids and gently explain to my son why others need space in a way he can understand. \n\nAutistic kids can have trouble with socialization and learning social cues but it is our JOB as their parent to HELP THEM learn these cues and how to interact with others in a safe and polite way, NOT help them railroad everyone else\u2019s kid.", "\nIt is not your children's job to sacrifice their childhood.", "Mother is the asshole. Her child has violent outbursts and destroys others\u2019 belongings and rather than replace them or stop her son, she expects others to lecture THEIR children and punish them until they accept her child.

She seems like an attentive, on the ball parent, which is something I don't find easy even with my shy, neurotypical kid, so I can only imagine how exhausting it must be with Aiden. \n\nShe coaches him when he's having trouble navigating a situation, and gives him reminders not to get too close to people's faces or swing his arms or smash toys. And he does usually listen. But a few minutes later, he forgets and starts again. I think this is where Sam feels the most frustrated. Sam also asks him nicely not to hit the cars, or please not yell, but then has to ask again a few moments later. \n\nAt home or in public, if Sam isn't behaving, there are consequences. So in his mind, he keeps asking and asking this kid for a different behavior, and Aiden isn't listening. Sam doesn't understand why the rules don't apply to Aiden. Sam is a shy kid, so when polite doesn't work, he opts to retreat rather than engage. Except for the toy snapping incident, where he inexplicably transformed into an old English schoolmarm for a moment ha.", "I'd say that she's probably a soft AH. Sounds like this kid needs more supervision until more social skills have been worked on.

Like? I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re struggling but if YOU are struggling, imagine how your kid feels when you allow things to blow out control and or proportion.

My autistic son tends to get easily overwhelmed in group situations and will meltdown and even break things as a form of equalizing behavior.  We try to avoid these situations as much as possible but sometimes he wants visit somewhere special like a playground, trampoline park, etc and so we try again (with the understanding that we\u2019ll leave if needed).  \n\nBut he does GREAT on 1:1 play dates and is a totally different kid because he isn\u2019t so anxious or overstimulated.  \n\nSo if your son ever does want to reconsider a private play date\u2026it might be worth trying.

I think it's more symbolic of his overall frustration that all the rules he's been taught don't work for Aiden.", "in the post it says that they did have the boys come over to their house for an individual play date instead of the playground group, and that both of OP\u2019s sons asked to not do that again. as someone who is neurodivergent and struggled socially as a kid, i really feel for aiden but his mother is doing him no favors by trying to force a friendship between these boys"]}
