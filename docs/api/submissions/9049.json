We look for spiders, dig in the mud, and stop at our neighborhood park to play. It's sort of a standing meetup for a bunch of parents in the area.\n\nRecently a new family moved in the next block over. The mother mentioned that she had two boys too, Kyle (13M) and Aiden (7M). I told her about the Sat morning park group in case she wanted to meet some neighbors.\n\nWhen she showed up with Aiden it was clear he has special needs. The mom was friendly, she sat with all the parents while the kids played. Aiden is an enthusiastic player. Loud noises, banging on things, getting up in the other kids faces. The mom was good about correcting him, and he wasn't aggressive, just excited.\n\nThe other kids are wary when he flails, but they include him in play still. One Sat he was having an especially tough day. I called Sam over for a snack. He said \"I don't want to play with Aiden, can we go home?\" So we left. The next day Aiden's mom came to my door. She told me that I should have talked to him about differently abled people instead of just abandoning her son. We agreed to talk to Sam.\n\nThe next weekend Sam said hi to Aiden, they played together a bit, but when Aiden got loud again, Sam retreated to the highest platform where Aiden was scared to go. When Aiden asked him to be his partner for a game, Sam said no thank you. I felt that was fine. My wife still felt bad, so she invited them over.\n\nAiden had one melt down but other than that it went fine. Afterwards Sam asked please could Aiden not come over again. I asked James what he thought of Kyle, he said that the kid was obnoxious and didn't smell great.\n\nThe next weekend, Aiden destroyed my son's favorite toy. He snapped the arms and legs off. Sam yelled \"YOU ARE A VERY MEAN LITTLE BOY!\" I did not make him apologize, we just left.\n\nNow instead of going out in the morning, we go on Sat afternoon after Aiden has left the park. \n\nAfter a few weeks, some others started joining us. We didn't discuss why. But I suspect that they didn't all shift their weekend routine around solely because they missed my sparkling personality.\n\nAiden's mom eventually got wind of it. I don't know how. She wrote us a long heartfelt letter. She felt I had not done enough to discourage Sam from ostracizing Aiden and that my \"pull\" in the neighborhood was influencing others to avoid her son now too.\n\nSam has tried his best. He's verbalized his need for boundaries from Aiden to us three times now. James has also been clear that he doesn't like the brother, Kyle. As long as both of my kids treat them with respect, I'm satisfied. \n\nI can't control what the other parents choose to do. We'll continue to be friendly and be good neighbors if they need a hand, but not play with them.

Every birthday she\u2019s invite all my classmates to these elaborate birthday parties I didn\u2019t want all in an effort to a) safe face and b) force socialization. \n\nI was miserable. There really is nothing more lonely than the people around you essentially being \u2018forced\u2019 to spend time with you. Special needs or not, a kid can pick up on that. And it sucks for all parties involved.\n\nSide note: considering the neurotypical, older son isn\u2019t exactly a social butterfly and popular with your kids either it seems like the mother has certain short comings when it comes to raising them and that\u2019s on her, not you, to fix. Her trying to strong arm and guilt trip you like this is just proof of this.", "I'm sure it's very difficult and heartbreaking for Aiden's mom to watch her child be alienated by his behaviors. She doesn't sound as though she's giving other children the same latitude as her son. \n\nIf you were Aiden's mother I think the only thing to recommend is finding a professional to help her help her child with his off-putting behavior.

It wouldn't be fair to make them suffer continuously.", "NTA.  Everyone should be polite, but everyone gets to pick their own friends.   And destroying another kids toys is mean.\n\nAnd no one else gets to tell you how to parent", "NTA.... your responsibility is your child and you can accommodate anyone else, disabled or not, to the extent that it doesn't disadvantage your child or put them in an awkward situation. Your kid has already tried to accommodate Kyle and he doesn't like it. Why would you force him? What lesson are you teaching him from that? To accommodate and roll over for things he doesn't want to do in life. Having a disabled kid is hard and that mom is going to have a tough ride.

They are very respectful.  Aiden's mom wishes things were different but blaming you for not doing enough is unacceptable.

They have come to conclusions on their own that these other boys are more than they can emotionally handle.

I wish her and her boys every success. \n\nYou have listened to your sons, heard their boundaries, and recognized their emotional limits.", "NTA. Some parents feel like just because their child is special needs then every single child and adult needs to bend over backwards for them. They end up doing their child a great disservice with the life lessons that accompany it. You and your children have not been rude in the slightest. It\u2019s not your sons\u2019 jobs to be their friends and keep them entertained if they don\u2019t want to be. It sounds like the mother needs to work on social skills with her children.", "NTA. Competing needs are a thing, and the other mother doesn't seem to understand this.", "NHITA.\n\nSpecial Needs teacher here (paraprofessional). There's a little boy in the child care center I look after, I'll call him Will. Will doesn't understand social norms. He often steps too far. He gets clingy with his best friend, who at times doesn't want to be clung to. He takes toys that other kids are playing with.\n\nThe other day, one of the golden children of the center-- call him Ben-- was discussing who he would be inviting to his birthday party. And sitting across from Will, he said, \"I won't invite Will though,\" matter-of-factly. I watched how Will took that quietly but painfully.\n\nI talked to Ben privately and asked him about the reasons he had said that right in front of Will, and he shrugged his shoulders. I asked him if he might have done it to reassure the other kids at the table that Will wouldn't be there to spoil the fun of the day, and his reactions suggested I was dead on. Instead of shaming him, I said, \"I get it. It's hard when your friends don't like another friend. But we should try a different way. Because Will carries around those little hurts, and even though Will can spoil the fun sometimes, we care about him, don't we?\"\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is this: nobody is perfect at navigating this stuff. It's tricky for you, and tricky for Aiden's parents, too, and tricky for the whole community. Aiden's mom can't be 100% on top of him. He has to learn from his mistakes. All you can do is ask Sam to be kind to Aiden's mistakes-- to forgive him, but that he doesn't have to be close to him if he just doesn't like Aiden.", "NAH  \n\n\nMan I was all prepared to whip out some righteous indignation and you took the wind out my sails lol.    \n\n\nSam was kind, polite and used his words to explain when he was uncomfortable and honestly a lot of adults can't manage that, so kudos to you and your wife for raising such a sweet, charming little kid.      \n\n\n  \nI feel for Aiden's mom.   She knows exactly what happened and why it happened and it's got to be devastating.     She's reaching out to you for help and it doesn't sound like she's been overly demanding or rude about it, unless you left something out.     She's going to have find a way to navigate this over the next decade, and it's going to suck.       \n\n\nJust continue to be kind and polite, and encourage Sam to be kind and polite and use his words.    There's no villains in this story, just a lot of sadness.", "NAH. It doesn\u2019t sound like your sons did anything disrespectful. I think it\u2019s good to teach your sons that they are not obligated to be around people who cross their boundaries. I\u2019m glad that you listened to them and honored their wishes. \n\nI can understand from the perspective of the mom with a disabled son, that they are new to the neighborhood and she wants her kids to make friends and feel included. She is in a difficult position and must advocate for her son, but also needs to respect the wishes and decisions of other neighborhood kids and parents.", "NTA and I\u2019m starting to have some challenging experiences myself. My daughter is so shy it\u2019s almost crippling. We do our best to get her out of this, play football every Saturday and there are a couple of special needs children, one is much older and physically capable but needs to be in a younger class. Clearly it\u2019s good for those with special needs to be included and I never thought anything of it until my daughter stopped wanting to play. She gets scared by the random outbursts and is too young to understand why it happens. She has gotten physically hurt sometimes, nothing more than accidental pushes but one father got smashed in the face and did a sterling job of not swearing in front of everyone. Physically this child is just more aggressive and stronger than all the other children and it\u2019s not his or the parents fault.\n\nSuddenly something I had been very supportive of was now changing in my mind. We are going to football this week but I\u2019m very close to giving it up for my daughters sake which would feel like a failure to me but I don\u2019t know what else to do.", "NAH. I feel for literally everyone in this story. \n\nI feel for your son, because I still remember being forced to interact with unpleasant kids when I was a child, and I hated it. It ruined my day, I felt on edge the whole time, it sucked. And it never made me accept the other kid, it just drilled into me how much I didn\u2019t like them. \n\nI feel sorry for Aiden because he can\u2019t help it. I feel sorry for Aidens mum because I cannot imagine the feeling of seeing your child be ostracised and just wishing everyone else cared about your child as much as you do, so they would do anything to make them happy. Cannot fucking imagine it and I would not wish a special needs child on any parent. \n\nBut you have tried, and as you say, you son has set down boundaries and does not want to play with Aiden. Unfortunately, at some point, that\u2019s that.", "NTA - Be polite as possible but no one should have to spend time with anyone they don't want to.", "NAH, for all the reasons the other replies have mentioned, so I won't repeat them.\n\nCurious--did you respond to the mother's letter? I think it would be worth laying out your thoughts here to her. I think it would be good letting her know you really feel for her and Aiden's struggles, but ultimately you have to respect your own kids' boundaries and it isn't working out right now. \n\nSomething just occurred to me-- if you wanted to try giving this just one more shot, would it be possible to try another supervised play date at Aiden's house, with both you and his mom present? Plus then Aiden can only break his own toys.\n\nIf not, I would consider possibly revisiting the play dates when Aiden is a little bit older. Right now he's having some problems with regulating, but in a couple years he might have better coping strategies, or your own kiddos could have built up a bit more of a tolerance to kids getting in their faces, who knows.\n\nMan, this is a tough one. I really feel for you all.", "NTA - your son is a 6 year old boy, he shouldn't be expected to have the maturity of an adult. He should be allowed to pick who he wants to be friends with .", "You're not excluding him based on disability.  NTA", "Nta.\n\n I feel for Aiden but his mother lost my sympathy the moment she tried to blame other people for her son's social limitations. It is her job to help Aiden adjust to social situations. Other kids are not obligated to feign friendship with a boy they simply do not enjoy playing with. It's a harsh reality for Aiden and Mom - but a reality nonetheless.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing what's right for your kids. Just because some other child is special, doesn't mean you are required to accept every wrong thing they do. \n\nYour kids gave them several chances, and they set their boundaries. You should be proud they did it in such a polite way.\n\nUnfortunately, her kid needs more professional help than what you can or should provide. She needs to teach her kid that it is not ok to act like he did. And accept that others have different boundaries. I'm sorry for her kid, but she needs to keep him under a closer care if he's constantly going over another's boundaries. Perhaps enroll him on a inclusive school, where he'll learn it without his mother been able to excuse his behavior, with the help of professionals. \n\nYou are not responsible for what your neighbors do or don't do. You don't control their schedules. It's not on you they reached their limits and decided to not be close to her kid anymore.", "NTA I think you handled it perfectly", "NAH\n\nI really sounds like you did as much as you could. Your children also seemed to be patient and polite, which is a testament to how you\u2019ve raised them. It\u2019s okay to not want to spend time with people who upset you, regardless of *why* they upset you. It may not be Aiden\u2019s fault that he has trouble socializing, but it\u2019s not your kids\u2019 fault that his behavior makes them uncomfortable or that he breaks their property either. My heart goes out to those kids and their parents. I can only imagine how frustrating it must be; but at the end of the day, you can\u2019t *force* your kids to be friends with people they don\u2019t want to be friends with.", "NAH - I don't think anyone is being an asshole here. \n\nA lot of people here are being very judgemental (which OP is not) and advocating ostracising this kid, which is effectively what is happening.\n\nIt is a tough situation, because we want the best for our kids, but I don't think speaking to Sam about excluding Aiden agains would be doing him a disservice. Cutting short play sessions could be a better solution than letting him cut the kid off. I think Sam would benefit from spending time with Aiden, kids do need to state and restate boundaries.", "NAH, but...\n\nIf you would like to further include this family there may be other activities you can do without alienating your own kids. It's possible that the park group is not the best environment for all of the kids to enjoy themselves and for Aiden to be his best self, it just happens to be how the group connected.\n\nIt's worth a discussion with Aiden's mom and sharing that Sam and Aiden have had a difficult time getting along at the park meetups. Does she have any ideas for other activities that might be more fun for all of the kids? Maybe Aiden loves for example bowling and everyone can enjoy that (in parallel). \n\nRegardless of what happens between the kids, there's also an opportunity here for valuable lessons for your kids in empathy (not sympathy). These are lifelong skills that will benefit them in school, in work, in relationships. Spending more time discussing how they felt about spending time with Aiden, letting them reflect on how things are from Aiden's perspective.\n\nI'm not suggesting you should force them to be friends or that it will teach empathy. But it is important to learn to be accepting of others with differences and think from others points of view.", "I was done with this fucking kid even before he destroyed the toy. You\u2019re not obligated to be anyone\u2019s friend and neither is your son. He gave an honest effort. Put the kid in a freaking special home or something.", "NTA but not good either. It\u2019s easy to protect and remove our kids from things that make them feel  uncomfortable. It is hard to teach them compassion and patience. My cousin was severely handicapped and he taught us all to be kinder than normal, be more forgiving, be more loving. So when we moved next door to an autistic child, there was a lot of conversations. About what he may not understand and the different challenges he may be facing. After some time, my girl was the first non relative or caregiver that he hugged. It was a big deal and she takes a huge pride in looking after him now. He is non verbal but they communicate. Sometimes we have to leave early but that\u2019s because she is needing space, not because he is too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They also get to have age appropriate boundaries. \n\nForcing them to be around another child they don't like is going to do nothing but cause resentment and could lead to an even worse outcome of bullying to get away from the situation. I'm not saying your kids would, just that this has been known to happen many times in the past to many different people. \n\nI am sorry the mom is struggling, but she has to understand that it is up to her to help her son understand that some people just aren't going to be interested in being friends. That others don't like having their things broken. And she needs to be aware enough to remove her son when he is pushing other kids too far with no personal space, loudness, and breaking things. It is what would most likely help him learn that if he keeps doing things that others find hurtful, he has to leave and go home. Mom isn't doing him any favors.", "NTA.

You don't owe her any kind of explanation, Her son requires specific needs and attention, yes -- but she cannot expect every child to know what that means let alone know how to interact with Aiden, they're just kids. \n\nSure as parents, you can teach our kids right from wrong and there times some kids and people need different type of attention and care.\n\nBUT it does not seem like your kids took one look at aiden and refused to play and interact with him. It took a couple of interactions and your kid expressed clearly that he did not want to play with aiden.\n\nIt's just a sucky situation, because forcing your kids to hang out with aiden just for his benefit its not gonna turn out well.

If you respond to this mother, I would start with your second-to-last paragraph that you\u2019ve written here: \u201cSam has tried his best . . .\u201d", "NTA.  In fact, you WOULD be the asshole if you demand your kids continue to spend time with others who are mean to them.  \n\nI think your kids did exactly the right thing- they tried to include Aiden in the group.  They did not discriminate against him because he's disabled.  They gave him a solid chance, several in fact.  \n\nSo right now you have two choices.  You can order Sam and James to play with Aiden and Kyle, basically telling them that they don't get to choose who they hang out with or who they are friends with.  IMHO, that's the wrong lesson.  \n\nOr you can respect their requests, and as a side effect Aiden doesn't get played with as much.  \n\nPersonally I'd do both-- I'd talk to Sam and James, and basically try to push some empathy- point out that Aiden can't always control his own actions, that he does bad things because he doesn't have the ability to stop, so it's probably pretty lonely for Aiden when kids don't want to play with him.  But, it's important that they understand now that it's THEIR choice who their friends are, nobody (not even you) should ever DEMAND friendship.  Friendship is given, not taken.  \nThen let them make their own choice.  \n\nAs for Aiden's mom- write her back.  Tell her you sympathize with her situation and with Aiden very much, and you can't imagine how hard it is for her, and you want to help her if you can.  But at the same time, you can't force your own kids to be friends with hers.  You have taught them to treat everybody with respect, as you feel that's an important lesson, but you also feel that personal agency is important for a child to learn, especially when it comes to friendships.  You'd like it very much if the boys were friends, but you don't feel it's right to force Sam and James to pretend to be friends with Aiden as you feel that would just make Sam and James resent Aiden.  That's not the situation you want to create.", "NAH and I would definitely miss your sparkling personality lol", "I can't tell Y T A vs N T A.\n\nIs there any way that you set some rules before play dates with Aiden? Like not bringing your own toys, telling Aiden's mom that your son is tired before leaving, etc.\n\nBc I agree that your son shouldn't have his things damaged. However I also think that this may teach your son that avoiding disabled people is ok because they're different", "NTA. Aiden's mom is acting on the belief that other children should put her child's needs before their own and that's just not Ok.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like Sam went through the wringer trying to accept this boy. He shouldn't be forced to play with kids he doesn't like. What kind of message would that send??? That Aiden's feelings are more important than Sam's? I feel bad for Aiden's mother, but she needs to be realistic.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou aren't an AH for respecting your son's wishes not play with the special needs child.\n\nBut you and the other parents are assholes for going out of your way to avoid the park when a special needs child is there.\n\nWhat is this teaching children?  That they can't share the same air as a person with a disability??? So he's different and loud. You said he isn't aggressive.  And if your son doesn't like him, he doesn't have to play with him.  And you shouldn't force your son to play with him. But to avoid the park altogether is all sorts of wrong. Not just for the horrible shunning of a child with a disability. But because you're teaching your son to avoid instead of how to advocate for himself when someone makes him uncomfortable.  \n\nSo this kid broke your son's toy.  Since you said that the child is not aggressive, he might have broken it accidentally, due to a fine motor issue for example.  If the child did not have a disability and broke your son's toy, would you be shunning him?  Toys breaking in play is not an unusual scenario.  So it just seems like a massive over reaction.  Again, your son does not have to play with this boy. But shunning him seems like a very bad message to send and does not reflect well on human compassion.", "So it's okay that the play group has noticeably shifted away from when Aiden is there? I just don't know how to fix it in a way that isn't unfair to someone.", "That's exactly what my wife said. She respects our boys autonomy to choose their friends, but she feels terribly for this mom who is just trying her best.", "I really appreciate your perspective on this. I read it to my wife and she teared up, so thank you. I agree. Aiden is a smart kid, and he's sweet too. I can't imagine that he doesn't pick up on at least some of the discomfort. \n\nWith the older boy, I'm not 100% sure if he's just a socially awkward basement gamer type guy, or if there's a mild issue with him too. My older son is way more extroverted than my younger and not at all picky about his friends, so if he says this boy is a drag to be around, it must be pretty rough.", "I think she does have him in quite a few programs. This is 100% my own speculation but  the dad seems to work quite long hours so I think maybe they're paying for a lot more out of their own pocket too. I can't fault the mom for how she handles him, and I don't really know what she could do aside looking for a special needs specific play group? She just really wants her kid to be accepted here in this community too, which I get.", "I had to deal with this too! I\u2019ve questioned for years over whether I was just an asshole little kid but reading this puts it in different perspective for me. \n\nAt ages 6-8 I was forced to be friends with a girl in my grade. She was special needs and I always tried to be nice to her in class, but her parents got wind of it and started inviting me over and getting her invited over to my house. I never had a choice in any of this. She would only eat bologna sandwiches on white bread with the crusts cut off, and I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything else when I ate with her. I can\u2019t even count the times she would get in my sisters\u2019 faces to steal a toy or not let them into a room IN THEIR OWN HOUSE and make them cry. My parents would always try to laugh it off or just ignore me. I don\u2019t know if they were just that oblivious or they just wanted to feel good about what they thought of as kindness.\n\nI totally get trying to be nice to everyone and teaching your kids to be understanding of special needs, but those 3 years were ridiculous. Kids should have the right to choose their friends and feel safe.", "I grew up in a similar situation. But the difference with me, however, I came to find out my parents where bigots (e.g. never allowed to hangout with anyone that wasn't white) and they were always scheming to get money out of some rich family. Freaking kids are going to figure this out sooner or later. They aren't as stupid as my parents think.", "Right? Forcing interaction isn\u2019t a good way to foster empathy. In fact, it\u2019s a good way to foster resentment.", "I really appreciate that. I've been feeling badly because the other parents have followed our lead (not with discussion or anything, I can only assume why) so I do get why the mom feels like everyone has abandoned them.", "Have to agree, NAH in this situation \n\nYou fostered an opportunity for them to engage, but its not just the younger brother your sons don't like.\n\nAlso, him breaking the toy should've been brought up to his mother. He's still learning also, and he's learning on a different path than most are used to, but ignoring that action wasn't really the best move imho. \n\nHowever, I can understand why she feels the way she feels.", "Competing needs, I like the way you framed that. Thank you.", "Special needs mom here, sitting in a parking lot waiting for school to finish.  I cried reading your response to Ben.  Thank you for your caring heart.  \n\nAs for OP, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong.  Sometimes some of us are dealt difficult hands.  I would just add that maybe if the moms in the neighborhood have a get together at night to maybe issue an invitation.  It\u2019s a lonely life.", "That's where I'm stuck. We are a tight community who often watch each other's kids, have barbeques, etc. If a whole block was participating in something that I couldn't join, I'd feel like shit too, even if it wasn't intentional.", "You articulated it really well here. No answer really feels fair to everyone. I hope you find something that works for your daughter, it's awesome that you at least gave football a try.", "Appreciate it. We haven't yet. She hand delivered the letter to us, and said that she apologized for the format but she was very emotional and felt it was an easier way to express herself. Totally get it, it's a hard thing to articulate.\n\nWhen she delivered the letter we were a little taken back, she stopped by in the middle of dinner, but we were friendly, we thanked her and said we'd read it, take some time to think and get back to her. We haven't replied past that yet.\n\nShe did request a private play date in the letter for the younger boys, as well as asking for James to come over and game with her oldest, who apparently really liked him the two times they hung out. Both boys were hard no's. Sam is uncomfortable even walking past Aiden's house right now, and James loves to bike and be active, he isn't a big gamer and thinks Kyle is obnoxious. (He kinda is). We did lend Kyle a spare bike so they could go riding together and hopefully find some common ground, but he apparently complained the whole time and they cut the ride short.\n\nAnother commenter suggested at least doing an adults only meeting instead, which I like. We can at least explain our position and hopefully mend the adult relationship, she lives on the street and we don't want her feeling unwelcome here. Maybe we can revisit the kid's relationships down the road when everyone is a bit older.", "I think compassion and patience can be taught without forcing a child to spend time around people they don\u2019t want to be around, after being explicit they didn\u2019t want to be around them, and especially going through the experiences of having your property/toys broken by them. \n\nI also think OP would be disrespecting the boundaries and opinions his kid is trying to set. He doesn\u2019t want to play with Sam. He\u2019s also not obligated to be friends with someone because they\u2019re autistic, out of a sense of guilt (as in, I should be friends with them BECAUSE they\u2019re autistic, vs I should be friends with them because I like them and enjoy being around them, and oh unrelated, they happen to have autism).", "Well put. Where I'm struggling most is that a number of other parents have also shifted over to playing in the afternoon as well. I didn't ask them to (aside from one friend who texted saying his son missed mine, so I did let him know that we attend in the afternoon now if he wanted to catch up). So this nice, well meaning woman brings her kid to the meet up I invited her to, probably feels excited about finding a community, and then I disappear shortly after and most of the others do too. That has to feel like a conspiracy of sorts, even if it wasn't a plot to avoid her or her child, just parents individually making a choice. \n\nWe've known most of the other parents for years, we've babysat, done emergency hospital runs, bailed water out of flooded basements. This poor lady moves into the middle of it with a tough situation and unfortunately now probably feels so defeated.", "I agree. I want my sons to both be kind, tolerant people who include others. Putting them in a bubble and not allowing them to feel discomfort and grow through it, doesn't solve anything. \n\nBut I also don't want them to feel that their choices don't matter, or to not trust their mom and I to respect their wishes when reasonable. It's tough.", "Unless you formally run the playgroup and have informed parents of a shift in time and location- purposefully leaving their family out then NAH. I have run a playgroup before and had to make these kinds of announcements about changing dates/location- doesn't sound like what is happening here.

It\u2019s not your duty to ensure Aiden has friends. There are other kids out there who will befriend him and be cool with his play style.", "That's called the consequences of actions. Aidan's mom could do better to handle him and instead of doing that she just blames everyone else. \n\nMy younger brother is severely autistic and will never live on his own. Everyone loves him because he's a sweeatheart. He flails his arms and hands, he makes noises, and yet he's not annoying. \n\nAidan's mom can shove it.", "I think its fine because nobody did it to be evil", "You didn\u2019t call your neighbors, and tell them what you were doing.

No one is obligated to be friends. \n\nNTA", "I wonder if Aiden\u2019s mom was too pushy with the other parents and maybe that\u2019s why they have been avoiding her?? You\u2019re kids were respectful and everyone included him until he broke toys. That kid was not being ostracized but some parents personality\u2019s ostracize their own kids. Outbursts can be common due to sensory issues but a lot of people on the spectrum or not can have them. The positive is that you handled this so well and your son was able to communicate his feelings productively. Your son is not bad for separating himself if anything you can teach your kid that if he\u2019s uncomfortable or needs a timeout that it\u2019s perfectly fine to take space and how to have a dialogue with other kids.", "Super happy to help! It infuriates me that this woman made you question your and your wives parenting because from what you've written, your sons are perfect gentlemen and on their way to becoming wonderful men one day. \n\nIt's not easy being neurodivergent, so I definitely feel for Aiden, but it's not helped by forcing anyone into being his \"friend\". My mother tried to no avail. I only started to become better once I met my childhood friends who CHOSE to be with me, one in particular who is by my side to this day. \n\nShe really changed me and helped me on my journey to becoming the (mostly) well-adjusted person that I am today. Not because she did anything crazy, really. She mostly just watched me play, because \"I love the stories you make up and your enthusiasm!\"\n\nTo this day, this is the most meaningful thing anyone has ever said to me. What others saw as a grievance, she genuinely saw as an asset! She loved that I was loud and imaginative and knew what I wanted to do. And one day Aiden will meet HIS person as well, it's just quite obvious that Sam isn't it.\n\nAgain, I can't stretch this enough, your boys are little miracles. I WISH the kids back then had been as kind and compassionate and eloquent as your kid is at 6. I also very much respect you guys for hearing him out and respecting his boundaries.

I\u2019m so darn picky with people, I drive myself nuts", "Yeah, I get it too.\n\nWhat I was poorly trying to convey is other kids in the neighborhood could have developmental issues as well.  Perhaps even regressing due to interactions.\n\nI really feel bad for both of them. Any possibility of just doing one on one conversation with mom?

It\u2019s likely there are other special needs children in the area that may be a better fit for her son. Not to say her son has to be siloed - but it\u2019s ultimately up to every individual.", "I think neighborhood-wide events like BBQs are different than forced interactions between your kids and hers. Your kids can interact respectfully with her kids and other kids during neighborhood events and not be stuck playing with them 1:1 for an extended period of time.", "I didn't have enough space to include it in the main post, but the mom did ask for something similar  in her letter. She asked if we could have the boys get together again at one of our houses so they could mend the rift, and she also mentioned that Kyle wanted to spend more time with James and talks about him all the time. We definitely don't want to do that.\n\nI like your idea to have an adults only conversation instead, to at least explain our position and make sure she understands she is not disliked, always welcome to ask for help if she needs something, etc. It will be emotional, especially for my wife, but at least we can feel sure that we communicated as best as possible. Good call.", "Yeah I wanted to comment this myself. I don't think you were an a****** for removing your kids from a situation they didn't want to be a part of after being respectful and giving it multiple attempts.

He basically has no inside voice, and will \"hit play\" when playing as a super hero or something of that nature. His younger brother is just an obnoxious child who likes to push buttons and not listen. Put them together and you have some of the hardest kids to deal with as a parent. I wish I was kidding but they really do push our limits some days.\n\nI would not blame parents for switching times to not be around my kids, they are a handful and sometimes too much for someone. My oldest especially when he gets overwhelmed. Not every kid has to be friends, and being forced to can create more anger towards the kid in question and possibly ostracize them more in the process.\n\nI have had this kind of happen before. Used to live in an apartment complex and the neighbor kids got into the habit of asking if my kids could come play, cuz I was the free babysitter and I didnt mind making sure they stayed out the road while they kicked a ball or played tag ya know. They had a great time, loved hanging out with my kids. The girls across the street are a different story however. The youngest girl was just shy but warmed up, but after they played a couple times, the oldest started to treat my oldest differently. My oldest doesnt talk \"normally\". He repeats phrases, says my name is X (not putting his name here) and will just not talk in a typical fashion when spoken to. The oldest girl started asking why my son was talking like that and when we explained his autism she didnt seem to understand. And started to just avoid him from then on. Its was disheartening to see tbh... But it was her choice. My kid isnt gonna click with everyone and he takes a bit more patience to understand some days more than others. \n\nSo I can understand where you are coming from, but please try to explain why the child is different but not in a patronizing way so that your son understands that sometimes there are others like us that are just different in their own way. The way I explain it is that my son is just like you and me, just sometimes he needs help with his words and emotions.", "As a side note - please don't say \"differently abled\".

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s sad for the mom to watch her child struggle to connect with other kids, but his behavior sounds startling and frustrating, and that tends to drive other kids away. Ultimately you weren\u2019t rude, you were putting your own kid and his comfort, feelings, and safety first, which is what you should be doing. Your child is not required to be friends with this child or any other child for that matter, and his mother reaching out like that was inappropriate.", "NTA.

Its unfortunate that your decision to keep your son comfortable during his playtime ended up with parents joining you, (its not like you told them, they were probably just not getting along with the new family either), and causing Aidens mom to blame you.\n\nPerhaps write her a letter back/talk to her that your intentions weren't to start anything, but you were simply listening to what your son was telling you? He was never mean to Aiden, he simply expressed his discomfort. Forcing kids to get along never ends well. \nHaving a special needs kid can be incredibly tough but the mom also needs to make sure she doesn't brush off any bad behavior from Aiden.

She probably needs support, but she will surely understand if you explain that your son was not feeling could. And supporting her by being her friend might also open future opportunities when you Mr son is older and maybe more able to accept the difference.\nI think being confronted to others who are different is great for children (and adults) as you learn to be more tolerant and accepting, and very often can appreciate how lucky you are.\nI saw some of your comments and you seem like a nice guy so hopefully you can be friendly with this family without putting pressure on your own son.\nGood luck to you and to them!\n\ud83d\udc96", "NTA.

If you force him to be around Aiden he'll feel abandoned. Kids don't like shots either but you can at least explain the benefit in terms they'll understand. There is no benefit to Sam and for a 6-year-old their altruism has limits. He'll just think you're putting him at the mercy of someone who scares him and breaks his toys.

Were they actively trying to avoid him, or was it a domino situation where some kids just wanted to be at the park at the same time as their friends?

But I also can't fault mom for wanting her child to be able to join in the very convenient neighborhood playgroup that's right at her door, so he can feel like 'just one of the gang' like all the other kids on the block. He's sort of on a weird line where he's capable of interacting decently 80% of the time, it's just that other 20% where things get hairy, and it's so interspersed with the normal moments, it's impossible to predict or do short bursts without incident.", "I'm so sorry that happened to you, that's awful.

My friend was tiny and this girl was big and strong and my friend was terrified because R was so unpredictable. My friend got knocked on her can a few times before her mom let her off the hook. She held that against her mom for a long time. Not saying Aiden would do the same but the fear of the unpredictable outbursts is real and can be more impactful for a young, quiet boy like your Sam.\n\nIf the mom picked you out as the alpha maybe it's because you dropped out of the group first?\n\nHope it works out for all of you.", "This is so sad,it made me cry. I have been physically disabled since I was 5 months old,and this brought back old memories of isolation. You're NTA, you are a good parent but there's honestly no happy ending for Aiden or his mom in this group. I hope they find an accepting community.", "Thank you! I'm glad you're considering your son's feelings!

He would just yell and scream the whole time while the aid would try to calm him down. As a child in that classroom I remember thinking, why is he in here disrupting us? I cannot concentrate on the work I need to do. \n\nLooking back now and doing education classes I understand what inclusion is but what I don\u2019t understand is why disrupt young children everyday?", "The one thing I usually make sure others knows my son does need accommodation on is foods.\n\nHe has such a limited range of foods he\u2019ll actually eat so when we\u2019re at family gatherings or parties I\u2019ve just started bringing enough of his favorite snacks for ALL the kids that will be there so none of them see him as being treated better or specially. It\u2019s done wonders.\n\nWe had one bbq with family where everyone was having hot dogs and hamburgers but my son won\u2019t eat that so we had plain cheese pizza for him. My cousins daughter wanted pizza too so I told her as long as her parents said yes, I would be happy to get her some. I\u2019d already made sure to have extra on hand incase she wanted some. Worked perfectly. My son got the food he\u2019d actually eat, she got to eat the same thing so she didn\u2019t think he was getting special treatment.\n\nOther bbqs I\u2019ve brought his favorite chips and enough to share with all the kids so that they can all enjoy the same snacks but my son also will actually have something he\u2019ll eat. We\u2019re very blessed that everyone in our family understands my son is autistic and they\u2019re always willing to let us have a place to take him if he needs to calm down.", "\\*Dad", "Just here to second this really strongly.\n\nThe emphasis on teaching their kids to respect others regardless of their struggles, but still listening to their kids' needs for boundaries and allowing them their preferences isn't just good parenting. It paints the picture of a really loving, caring, nurturing family.\n\nThe fact that OP even came here to ask this and has concerns and guilt over the situation speaks volumes.\n\nNTA all the way.

No child should have to feel isolated like that. \n\nI guess it's just hard to swallow that even if you are not the bad guy in general, sometimes you can't avoid being the bad guy in someone else's story no matter what you do. Aiden's mom sees our family as the key to righting it with the whole neighborhood, so in a way I'm denying her a lot more than just one kid. \n\nI hope they find a community who's better equipped to give them a positive experience too.", "??? what???", "OP didn\u2019t explicitly talk about what he talked about, but I\u2019m assuming he did his due diligence. That might be my mistake to assume that, but when OP says he \u201ctalked to his son about it\u201d within the context of him being Aiden\u2019s friend, I\u2019m sure on some level it came up. \n\nOnce again, I think that we should be aware of WHY we\u2019re being friends with someone. Are you intentionally being someone\u2019s friend because they\u2019re of lesser ability and are doing it out of a sense of justice/obligation BECAUSE they\u2019re autistic/neurodivergent/etc. or out of legitimate interest/enjoyment of their company/etc. \n\nWe might have different opinions on this and that\u2019s ok. But I would NEVER want someone to be my friends because of my neurodivergence/trait, placing that above me as a person, which sounds a little bit like what you\u2019re encouraging.", "This is a real problem with the mass-schooling system. The kid was not yelling and screaming for no reason. He was communicating, and probably communicating his immense discomfort in this situation. Ideally he would be in an environment where he felt comfortable and at ease, and it clearly wasn\u2019t that classroom.", "I don't know the answer, but (sometimes exasperated parent of autistic kid) I wonder if they were trying to acclimatise the other child to being around other kids, and familiarise the other kids to being around someone different.\n\nIn a best case scenario, perhaps the other kid would eventually find the setup familiar enough that they might calm down and make some personal connections. Sadly, it sounds like the adults were overly optimistic, but I can understand if that was their thinking.", "That was inclusion done very poorly. The child nor the classmates benefitted from the experience.", "A lot has changed since I was in middle school, but I had the same experience. I had been in some of the gifted classes and we had the special needs class join us for a few subjects a day because we were the \u201cmodel behavior\u201d. Some aides would remove students when actions became disruptive, but often the parent of the special needs student would throw a fit of their child was removed, even if it was in the child\u2019s best interest.  They demanded full inclusion, to the detriment of the entire class. \n\nMy first year teaching I had to see it from the other side. I had 12 pre-k kids and one was autistic. I didn\u2019t have an aide so there was no backup. I was proud of my kids for standing up for her on the playground when other classes would bully her because they didn\u2019t see her as different, she was just their friend who had some quirks. My only complaints were from parents of the other kids who thought their kids were not receiving appropriate attention because of her. They refused to see how I chose the times to push her on something she didn\u2019t want to do (if every kid was enjoying a party and didn\u2019t need help, I took 3 minutes to convince her to take one bite of a cupcake and then let it go. The kids didn\u2019t even notice, but the parent complained and tried to pull her kid because of it). I always ensured that side lessons with her were done when the class would not be affected. \n\nUltimately, my issue with both experiences was the parents. Parents of special needs children have a lot more resources and understanding now, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easier for them. This mom overstepped and decided that her child\u2019s needs superseded that of OP\u2019s, which is a narrow-sighted view I came across often. OP handled it better than my other student\u2019s parent by making an effort, having that discussion with his child, and respecting the son\u2019s boundaries. He didn\u2019t say that the other child couldn\u2019t come to the park or needed to be separated from the other kids, he made a rational and respectful adjustment. In the end, yes the neighborhood kids got some distance from this one child, but it wasn\u2019t done in a discriminatory way", "Mine is from 4th grade and he was verbal but would have bouts of anger where he would destroy the classroom. I remember having drills about evacuating the room if it happened and we did have to evacuate a couple times. I think he got pulled because parents complained but can\u2019t blame them when a couple kids almost got seriously hurt by chairs or being squished by a desk. I get inclusion but at the same time it can be extremely dangerous or scary for young kids.", "Probably either your memory is forgetting some things or things weren't happening correctly. But non-verbal students having outburst isn't for no reason. It could be that, despite how things looked to you, the student had a high understanding of some subjects. There are a lot of reasons, but non-verbal does non equal low cognition. This is a misconception.  \nIt's also a fact that SPED services are often a complete disaster. Districts are more interested in checking boxes and avoiding lawsuits than doing what's best for kids...", "Aiden\u2019s mom probably feels like she\u2019s \u201cfighting his corner\u201d, but she\u2019s on a hiding to nothing by trying to force others to socialise with her son when they don\u2019t want to.

That way Aiden and his mom might find the friendship and community they seek.", "Ask a US Marine\u2026", "You are right on all spots here. We do not have to agree. That is the beauty of diversity of mentality. And you are right I am teaching her to befriend those that need friends. I am teaching her to look out for the ones no one is looking out for. I am teaching her to be kind simply because someone is struggling and trying. She is the kind of person that was built for it. All kids are different. If I had a timid kid or an insecure kid, I would probably handle it differently but I like to see she is strong enough to go out of her comfort zone for the comfort of someone else. She\u2019s set on being a teacher so it fits her personality to look out for EVERYONE. But not every kid is built for that heavy load, imagine if parents helped their kids be that strong though. How beautiful would our world be of able kids could be loving and accepting to less abled kids, treated them like they weren\u2019t less. Imagine", "Yes. This was inclusion done very poorly.

(The mom might lack the skills to do this.) Because you can lecture your 6 y.o. until you're blue in the face about differently abled kids, but he still isn't going to be willing to play with a kid who tears his toys to pieces and screams at him.

Recently, I wanted to get a male cat, hoping for one who would be a little more cuddly as our two girls are loving but in a \"I need my space, dad.\" kind of way.\n\nI wanted a kitten. But around that time a family member was moving overseas and had a very cute, 2 year old male cat that they could not bring. After meeting the cat (who was perfectly nice) a few times, and being told by his owners that he has a very sweet temperament, really wants to be around other cats, and gets lonely so they would like a home with other cats to keep him company, my girlfriend and I agreed to take him into our home.\n\nFast forward three weeks to today. He was rehomed this morning. \nIt quickly became apparent that these family members had NO IDEA how to raise, train, or socialise a cat. Let alone actually understand their behaviour. Once he was released from a mandatory 2 week acclimating period wherein he was slowly allowed to meet our girls through doors and screens, he quickly became the terror of the house. Not only bullying and dominating our two sweet girls into paranoia by taking ALL their toys and special spots in the house, to the point that I almost didn't see them for a few days (before he was separated again) because they would squish themselves into tiny places to hide from him.\n\nHe also wreaked absolute havoc on our mental health with his insanely unmanaged separation anxiety. When separated he would meow and yell and yowl at the top of his lungs all hours of the day and night to be let out. Regardless how much time we spent petting or playing with him. He just wanted OUT so he could bully our girls. He was also NOT a nice cat and would hiss and scratch after a minute or so of pets because his previous owners simply allowed him to do that finding it \"cute.\" It was not.\n\nSafe to say we came to absolutely hate this cat in the 3 short weeks he was here and couldn't be rid of him fast enough. Of course all this was communicated to his previous owners kindly and gently. We know it isn't the animal's fault but we wouldn't allow our girls or ourselves to be terrorised in our own home by a cat we welcomed in under ignorant, if not false pretenses.\n\nThat's as close as I've come to experiencing the situation you've described. I can only imagine how much more uncomfortable and difficult to navigate it's been for you.\nFor what it's worth, I think you've done an admirable job of trying to create the best situation for all involved.

And the other parents' choices aren't you responsibility.", "NAH - I am a SpEd teacher and parent of a child with special needs.  Yes, it is hard as a mom to see your kid excluded HOWEVER the new mom has not done her part here. She would have been  wise to be upfront with everyone in the new playgroup about what her son's needs and potential behaviors are. Having a playgroup at her own home where he has his own toys would be good until the kids got to know each other. It sounds like the boy has some impulse control issues and gets overly excited, so structured games on the playground may have been helpful. Also, by mom being  open you could have said hey he broke my son's toy or my son can't handle intense behavior. She needs to work on his behaviors so he can make friendships and this can happen at school in a Circle of Friends group. As long as your son is kind and not a bully, that is all you can ask for at this point.", "Nta. My best friend basically had to end a friendship because their autistic child would scream in my godsons face, hit him, rip toys out of his hands and basically override his 5 year old nervous system in 5 minutes of playtime.  Moms response was just to clasp her hands together and say how happy she was her son had a friend. There was no correction or even guidance on play her son was better suited for. Your son tried and that's great but if mom wants her kid included she has to put in the work.

When my daughter was young and she was around loud people whether rowdy children, gleeful children or arguing adults. She hid. She didn't like it. She was very uncomfortable around loud, rambunctious, disorderly children. The kids were not doing anything wrong. She was just unable to tolerate it.

Her situation sounds like it might be something like that.\n\nEither way OP, you have a responsibility to look after your kids first and it sounds like you are just doing that.", "NTA It\u2019s not your job to stay in a situation unsafe to your child just to teach him social skills toward another child.

I am sure Aiden's mom is emotionally wrung out and hates to see her child ostracized.

As Sam is too young to understand the complexities of something like autism, you\u2019d basically be teaching your child that he should invite bullies into his life and just put up with being poorly treated in a friendship. That\u2019s no good at all. \n\nI hope Aiden\u2019s mother stops trying to force neighbourhood kids to play with her son because it is NOT going to help him. She should be focusing her attention on getting him the best possible help to manage his autism in such a way that he can be a happy and functioning member of society - even as he is different from the norm.

My parents knew I didn\u2019t like her and had good reasons not to, yet they didn\u2019t respect my boundaries or have any understanding of it. And this wasn\u2019t the only time my parents didn\u2019t respect my boundaries either.\n\nI no longer talk to my dad and not respecting me as a person and my boundaries, is one of the MANY reasons ag I chose to go no contact with that asshole. \n\nSo good on you OP for respecting your kids\u2019 boundaries.", "Spot on.

It makes sense that Sam would have a harder time correlating Aiden with his friends at school without that physical reminder. Really great insight.", "Understood. I used that word only because it was the word Aiden's mom used when she spoke to me.

He should\u2019ve been in the special education room, playing with baby toys and being taught his colours, but instead he was in class with us.\n\nThis was in Canada, btw, in an average-sized town with plenty of resources available to special needs children (or at least more than what is usually available in America).", "I was an elementary educator for 15 years. Public education is as susceptible to trends, outside (and often outsized) opinions and shifting theories about 'best practices' as any other large system. Yes, there was definitely a time that we tried very hard to include children with special needs in the mainstream classroom, and this was largely driven by 1.) their parents and 2.) beuracratric cost cutters. You cannot cure a child's special needs by simply exposing them to other children, nor can you place the burden of mitigating those needs on the other children or their parents. To rephrase, you can't cure cancer by sitting in a classroom with people that don't have cancer.

I'm sorry that she's having a hard time of it, but she'd going to have a worse one if she keeps putting 'you have to keep trying to accept him' onto everyone else. Some people on the spectrum do find a way to learn how to fit in or learn behaviors and cues that make them better friends. Some aren't capable of it, sometimes through no fault of their own or their parents, it's just the nature of their divergence.

It sounds like many of the other kids feel the same way. While I do feel for Aiden, it's your job as a parent to make your kid feel safe. \n\n\nAiden's mom is going about this the wrong way, IMO. She wants everyone to treat Aiden both as a normal kid and be forgiving because of his issues. You have treated him as a normal kid. If a normal kid was breaking your son's toys, making him uncomfortable, and the boy's parent let them behave that way, would you have acted any different?\n\n\nAs a kid that grew up with ADD and mild autism, I'm happy when others are understanding of my quirks. **But!** I also know it's my job to fit with the world, not the world's to change for me. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This mom seems to expect the world to change for her son. Which is doing him no favors. Rather than excusing his bad behavior as him being 'differently abled' (blegh), she should be helping him learn to regulate himself. It's a lot more work initially, but it's why I'm only 'quirky' now. It's no longer a bug, it's a feature! \n\n\nBut all that is not your problem, because he's not your kid. My advice? If the mom pressures you again, have a list of incidents where Aiden either acted badly, or broke things. Leave how your Sam feels out of it, because she'll just claim Sam's being prejudiced against Aiden for his disability or possibly make Sam a target for her annoyance. Ask how she plans to prevent whatever it was from happening again. If she replies that he's different, he can't help it, so you should be understanding, just tell her 'Yes, he different. He's also a kid.

I would be willing to bet the flapping wouldn\u2019t bother them in any real way if they weren\u2019t concerned about physical and behavioral boundaries (like breaking others toys, grabbing, being too loud too long, and not giving space when asked). If she truly wants the best for her child, she will take that note.", "I mean, one of the first clues was using \"differently abled\".\n\nNo, fuck off. Disabled isn't a dirty word. If your kid, as the disabled person, chooses to use another descriptor for themselves, more power to them, but the phrase differently abled needs to go.\n\n(Obligatory I am both physically disabled and neurodiverse but do not pretend to speak for all disabled and nd people)", "Just a thought, the mother doesn't seem to be viewing your child as an actual child with his own needs, so maybe in that conversation you could find a nice way to ask her what she would do if the situation was reversed and Sam made Aidan uncomfortable and smashed his toys, would she force Aiden to spend time with someone he doesn't want to spend time with. Might put things into perspective for her.", "Oh you're fine, lol, I never thought it was you. \n\nDon't do the headset thing, lol. As long as the basic morals and values are the same, I think kids greatly benefit from having a couple of different parenting styles. Sometimes your kids need that \"You tell 'em son!\" cheer section, yknow?\n\nAnd no problem! Thank you for putting in the time to reply back! It's good to know if I'm occasionally actually helping people... or if not to at least converse a lil bit, idk, lol", "Oh god no, so sorry if I implied that. this would be a very different type of post if Sam had been deliberately physically harmed. \n\nThe example of Sam getting popped by accident when Aiden flails too close has happened, but it wasn't any worse than a tap on the shoulder, and very innocently done.", "Just saying\u2026sped means something else in Aussie slang. \ud83d\ude2c\nEdited to add: maybe write the whole thing with the acronym in brackets before going full acronym.", "I'm sure this will be buried in all the comments here but...\n\nMy auntie was what was then known as a nursery nurse in a special school (please bear in mind these were the correct terms for the 80's and 90's in the UK). She took a specific liking and sympathy for a certain kiddo with profound mental disabilities, who was the younger of 3 kids to a single mum, all with the same profound needs. He was almost teenage, non verbal, still in nappies etc. \n\nI was a few years younger than him, and every holidays my brother and I were forced to go on at least one day out with him when my auntie took him. It was absolutely traumatising. And I'm still saying this now as a mother of an autistic kid myself. He would press his face against the car window on every car ride and drool uncontrollably, and the drool stank horrifically so I'd be gagging the whole time. He was big, and violent, he had the body of a 12 year old and the mind of a toddler, complete with the tantrums. I was terrified of him as i watched him attack my auntie regularly, sometimes as she changed his nappy, so whole adult shit would be flying as he pulled her hair and bounced her head off a wall. I understand that the thinking behind forcing us to go with him on our auntie's days out was to teach us something or other about inclusion, but, again, as a parent now of a literal disabled child, all it did was cause stress, trauma and fear for a very small child.\n\nNobody should force kids to be around disabled kids who are violent or lack the capacity to be kind and respect boundaries if they are not comfortable. I know this probably isn't a PC comment but, again, as the parent of an autistic child myself, I said what I said.\n\nWhen my kid was younger and prone to bouts of similar behaviour as described in the OP, I would not and did not blame any parent or child who couldn't deal with him when he was having a bad day. Even if it made me sad for him, I never blamed them.", "This is an issue when school districts do strictly all inclusive. My kiddo\u2019s class only includes my kid or other ASD students if they thrive in that particular subject and class. My son is non verbal and has some pretty heightened behaviors. He is only in gym with neurotypical kids, because he enjoys it and thrives. He isn\u2019t forced into typical classes that he wouldn\u2019t thrive in. \n\nAll inclusive is very good when implemented well, this gives our kids time with various children, and gives typical kids more exposure to those different from them, developing empathy and acceptance. This has the reverse effect if the class isn\u2019t appropriate for our neurodiverse kiddos. My kid will melt down, other kids will only be disturbed, no one wins. \n\nBetter districts see the nuance here and act accordingly. Districts that simply say \u201call inclusive classes!\u201d To check a box of requirements, are not doing anyone any good. It should be up to parents, teachers, specialists, and IEP directives.", "Just imagining him as an adult in a supermarket.....", "Yeah...  I think something people are really failing to understand is the difference between \"learning the skills he needs to interact in a more appropriate way\" versus the ability to actually use those \"skills\".\n\nIt sounds like Aiden is autistic and while I don't have first hand experience with autistic kids, I do know part of the assistance that is recommended is coaching on social cues etc, but it's just a part...\n\nmy 7yo has ADHD.  It's different to autism, but there are some overlaps.\n\nFor the most part he KNOWS what he needs to do in social situations to keep the other kids from being put off, he's an extrovert and clearly, persistently, attempts to engage with other children, but he often can't stop himself from being \"too much\".\n\nIt's not a matter of \"learning skills\", it's a matter of him lacking available dopamine to consistently send the messages through his brain to \"shut up!\" \"Talk quieter!\" \"Don't get so excited!\"...  and when he *does* manager to do those things it's because he's dedicating 95% of his brain power to keeping himself in check, which makes him come off as hesitant and nervous, and takes a huge mental and emotional toll on him and isn't something he can keep up for extended periods of time.  \n\n\"Learning the skills\" essentially means teaching him that no one likes how he naturally is and he needs to constantly monitor every thing he does, never relaxing in front of his \"friends\" for fear his excitement and enthusiasm will scare them away.\n\nThe problem is that no one can do that constantly.  And to make things even harder, his compromised working memory makes the job even harder.  Most likely he won't have any real friends until he meets another ADHD kid who can match his energy, and isn't upset when he does things like forget their name for the first two weeks they know each other, because they understand why it happens and don't consider it an insult.\n\nOP said one of the things that happens is his son will ask Aiden to be quieter, back up, and not flail around so much...  but that a few minutes after the request Aiden will go back to doing those things.\n\nOP's son doesn't understand why Aiden doesn't listen...  but most likely Aiden listens, and WANTS to make those changes, but his brain doesn't retain that information, and when he gets excited again, he a) doesn't remember he's not supposed to and b) if he does remember he doesn't have the emotional control to reign himself back in.\n\nNow, I'm not saying OP or his son have to sit around and deal with that, but all the people pretending Aiden just needs to go to some specially designed classes on \"learning\" social cues and then he'll be able to make tons of friends are horribly naive.\n\nThat's not how Aiden's story is most likely to end...  OP would be doing his son a favor to respect his request, BUT ALSO to explain that Aiden doesn't act disrespectfully on purpose, his brain works differently and has a harder time executing the type of standard social niceties that he can do without event trying.\n\nBecause this won't be the only person with issues that OP's son will ever deal with, and understanding that Aiden is most likely trying incredibly hard to act \"normally\" and failing anyway, will go a long way to helping his son develop empathy for neurodivergent folks.", "The special need kid sounds like he didn't get anything positive put of that either.", "To add on, it's often a sound processing issue where either the autistic child struggles with recreating the words spoken to them OR it's apraxia of speech where they can understand sound well but the neural pathways for recreating are absent. \n\nSometimes the autistic person simply isn't interested in speech, which is selective mutism. \n\nNone of these are connected to cognition. They're just specific ways the neurodiverse brain works in this specific individual. \n\nBut when you combine a non-verbal person with autism of a young age (under 8) and a lack of AAC devices, often the only way the non-verbal person has to communicate in a way a neurotypical person understands is yelling. That's why Assistive Communication is so important."]}
