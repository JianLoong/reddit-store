I was making dinner one evening before I left for work, cutting some limes when the last slice slipped and I cut half way through my finger. We\u2019re both first responders so we get busy. I asked him to come home from work (it was overtime not regular shift) and help me finish dinner. He did without a second thought. When he\u2019s been playing video games all day and I ask him to do the dishes, he does them. This is a supportive partner. \n\nYou were working ALL DAY while he played video games. All you asked was for him to put something in the oven. Not even actually cook something. His reaction was over the top. It doesn\u2019t seem he sees you as his partner, but as lower than him.

What I sense from this is that you view yourself as being on his team, but he doesn\u2019t view  himself the same way. Asking your partner to do something for you isn\u2019t being demanding of his time, he\u2019s supposed to be on your side, have your back, whatever expression you want to use. When I see people in a relationship and the attitude is \u00a0\u201cdo it yourself, you have legs\u201d when it\u2019s clearly not a situation where one party is taking advantage of the other, I think the whole thing is doomed to fail. It\u2019s a recipe for loneliness and resentment.", "NTA. He doesn't seem so wonderful.

Him not helping and making a fuss while you tend to his every demand/ask do not sit well with me.\n\nHe is your partner, NOT your roommate.  Please raise your standard a bit and if he isn't putting an effort into this partnership, you really should stop doing favors for him because he doesn't deserve it and making himself looking like a victim when he was asked to help is soooo not attractive.", "WELL, it seems like he got offended because you called him out for playing all day, you could've just asked him and not say any critics about what he's doing.

Sure - if you're on fire, or you've just returned from the store with a load of groceries that need to go in the fridge & freezer right now, then you genuinely need help there and then.\n\nBut usually, that's not the situation.

Don\u2019t put up with that shit. He\u2019s done your head in if you think you\u2019re in any way in the wrong here. The fact that you have to ask if asking your partner for a favor while he\u2019s not busy and your bogged down with work makes you an asshole says ALOT about your relationship. Treat yourself better than this. You know you deserve better.", "Id rather have a homely, kind and loving man personally.  Looks fade. Crap personalities never die.", "NTA. Stuff like this can happen in relationship (taking for granted, etc). What a learned works really well is not negative enforcement when you don\u2019t have your needs met but positive reinforcement when they are. It might seem like a lot at the beginning because the task is so simple or shouldn\u2019t require a lot of thanks but I assure you if your partner understands what it means to you that they actually meet your needs the way you want then they\u2019ll voluntary act on them much more likely. Hope this helps (you guys\u2019ll be just fine).", "Not sure if you know this, but you're supposed to *want* to do things for your S/O. Things that make them happy, or help them out. I make my wife's lunch every day, have for the entirety of our relationship. And yeah, I like to cook, but packing a lunch isn't cooking- it's a chore. Sometimes it takes away from time I need to get my own stuff ready. But I wouldn't even consider not doing that for her. From the little you've mentioned about your boyfriend, I can't call him a selfish person. But it definitely seems like he only wants to do things that *he* benefits from.", "I see so many posts like yours.

If you want to be his caretaker, by all means have at it. If you want an equal partnership, this guy is pretty clearly not interested.", "So much for partnership, eh.  Is this what you want in a relationship?", "I used to manage a small group that provided services to several other groups in the company. My team were productive and happy with their jobs. Most of the managing I did consisted of protecting them from ridiculous demands from managers in other groups. People were calling my team *at home* to demand immediate attention. It took a while to stop that. Oh, and we were understaffed, of course.\n\nA good manager doesn't do \"very little.\" It can take a lot of work to move obstacles out of your team's way so they can actually do their assignments.", "I don\u2019t know about very little, a good manager should have things flowing smoothly and not running around putting out fires all day, but doing very little probably not.", "Oh dear. \n\nI have to tell you, OP, that this is not a healthy relationship. This is not a good partnership. \n\nMy hubby and I have been together for over 12 years. We still happily do things for each other all the time - like putting food in the oven. Heck, making an entire meal for the other person. We do it because we love each other. We care for each other. And we want to continue nourishing our relationship. \n\nI know it's not easy to hear, but the good news is that there is certainly something better out there for you. Someone who will respect and treasure you the way you respect and treasure them. Hugs!  \n\n\nAnd NTA.", "Why are you with this guy? What's the point in being in a relationship if your partner isn't there for you to lean on when you need help, and vice versa.

This is 100% the result of your boyfriend's actions and words.", "Legit the only response should have been \"sure babe\". That's it. He will continue using you.", "Yeah, assholes are the only ones who need to keep score, that way they can try and prove that they aren't assholes.\n\nPeople who actually aren't assholes don't need to prove it.", "Seriously though... he's your boyfriend.

Her comments give me a feeling he isn't as great as she says he is", "You really expect your spouse to ask you for an rsvp for you to put dinner into the oven (two minutes) for both of you when work gets busier than expected and plans change? Sounds exhausting.", "Yes, there are truly terrible abusive partners out there, but you\u2019re still valid in wanting to be able to count on him the way he can count on you. You don\u2019t have to tell yourself \u201cthis isn\u2019t important\u201d just because it\u2019s not a horrendous thing for him to do.\n\nIt\u2019s a crappy thing for him to do, and that matters. Partners help each other out. I got out of the bathtub to make my man tea on his way home because he\u2019s so sick and requested tea with honey in it. Then I got back in the bath. Your guy can go right back to his video game and he\u2019ll be just fine. Ideally, he would also go back to it feeling a bit warm and fuzzy because he helped his woman. It\u2019s weird that he doesn\u2019t have that impulse at all.", "Your replies are very sad tbh. I hope you find the confidence and self worth to realize he's not a good partner and leave", "How is that childish, but sitting around playing video games and refusing to do an extremely simple 30 second task is not childish? \n\nI think you may need to see a therapist because your views on relationships seem to contribute to his ongoing mistreatment of you. You're allowing him to use you, and he offers nothing in return other than \"good looks\".", "Whats childish is that you feel like you were in the wrong, grow a spine", "Instead of interrupting his very important Xbox time? Lol good luck ever finding a girlfriend", "Idk, maybe because OP was actually working while her BF was fucking around on games? \n\nSeems a reasonable ask to a long term, live in partner who isn't currently swamped with work and calls. Life happens sometimes and anyone would think their partner would give them a hand. *Especially* since the favor was so so minor.", "Because she was working a really packed, stressful day, and he was playing video games. It\u2019s just a thing where partners help each other out.", "I definitely agree! I\u2019m glad your husband respects you and cares for you!", "No, but I also don't expect to do it there and then, if I'm in the middle of something. It's a reasonable request - I'll get to it next time I come to a natural break.

She\u2019s hungry, would like to eat once she\u2019s off work, and there was like an hour or so of work left to do.", "I hope any partner you have doesn't put up with this childish bs treatment.", "What's childish is getting jealous that her partner had a free minute, so she had to think up busy work for him. It sounds like he was having his own stresses that he was soothing with distraction.", "You really aren't good at reading. She didn't just \"think up a task\", she was hungry. She is a human being. She was stuck in a demanding cycle of work tasks that prevented her from preparing food so she politely asked her live-in partner who was PLAYING VIDEO GAMES if he could do an extremely simple,one-minute task. Perhaps you didn't see any of OPs comments stating that he NEVER does any chores and always refuses when asked? The guy isn't just an AH, he's abusive. He is using this woman as a mother and sex toy.\n\nIdk how you can read these posts and conclude that this woman did anything wrong. Are you secretly her bf stalking this post or something? I feel bad for anyone you've dated.", "What's the point in being in a relationship if one can't lean on their partner for a few minutes to get some help with a task? OP is busy working, it's not going to kill her bf to stop gaming for a few minutes to put food in the oven."]}
