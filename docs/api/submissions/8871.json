I was making dinner one evening before I left for work, cutting some limes when the last slice slipped and I cut half way through my finger. We\u2019re both first responders so we get busy. I asked him to come home from work (it was overtime not regular shift) and help me finish dinner. He did without a second thought. When he\u2019s been playing video games all day and I ask him to do the dishes, he does them. This is a supportive partner. \n\nYou were working ALL DAY while he played video games. All you asked was for him to put something in the oven. Not even actually cook something. His reaction was over the top. It doesn\u2019t seem he sees you as his partner, but as lower than him.

What I sense from this is that you view yourself as being on his team, but he doesn\u2019t view  himself the same way. Asking your partner to do something for you isn\u2019t being demanding of his time, he\u2019s supposed to be on your side, have your back, whatever expression you want to use. When I see people in a relationship and the attitude is \u00a0\u201cdo it yourself, you have legs\u201d when it\u2019s clearly not a situation where one party is taking advantage of the other, I think the whole thing is doomed to fail. It\u2019s a recipe for loneliness and resentment.", "NTA. He doesn't seem so wonderful.

Him not helping and making a fuss while you tend to his every demand/ask do not sit well with me.\n\nHe is your partner, NOT your roommate.  Please raise your standard a bit and if he isn't putting an effort into this partnership, you really should stop doing favors for him because he doesn't deserve it and making himself looking like a victim when he was asked to help is soooo not attractive.", "WELL, it seems like he got offended because you called him out for playing all day, you could've just asked him and not say any critics about what he's doing.

Sure - if you're on fire, or you've just returned from the store with a load of groceries that need to go in the fridge & freezer right now, then you genuinely need help there and then.\n\nBut usually, that's not the situation.

This guy seems like he can\u2019t be bothered to help you. (Or him if he wants to eat too). Reliable, dependable, caring, looks out for you, has your back\u2026 \n\nNta.", "NTA and DTMFA", "Wait, so if he asks you to do something, you do it right away, but if you ask him to do something, he gets upset and refuses to do anything? He also hates it when he's asked to do anything he's politely asked to? I don't know man, to me it kinda sounds like the only work he wants to do is whatever his job wants, and then when work is over, he just wants to do nothing. To me, it sounds like he's a little bit of an AH in that regard. He could be helpful, but it seems he doesn't seem to like being helpful. \n\nNTA", "NTA - your partner is though. My husband works from home late into the evening. Usually the kids and I hang out in the playroom so they won't bother him at work. On the nights we have frozen pizza for dinner my husband always cooks it for us (even when he is crazy busy) because it takes 2 minutes to put something in the oven and 0 effort to listen for a timer. \n\nIt also works the other way. Just the other day, my husband took the kids for a couple of hours to his mom's. On the way back he called me to put a pizza in the oven. I wasn't hungry, the kids weren't hungry, only he was hungry. Guess what, I put it in the oven without complaint.", "It should not matter if he\u2019s not hungry or doesn\u2019t want any. He should do it because you asked him to put food in the oven. So simple. It\u2019s called having a loving and respectful relationship. The way he talked to you was unkind.", "NTA. what else does he get mad at you for?", "NTA. you had a reasonable request, he is being an AH", "There is nothing wrong with needing help. Its not small, my husband will check on me whenever I am home, will offer food and I will do the same. NTA, please evaluate what this guy is doing, you should never feel like asking to put something in the oven is a CHORE.", "NTA. I will never understand this. Living together is about being a team. He isn't a team player. He only does what benefits him. I've been around too like this.", "Good Lord, NTA. This is not what a healthy relationship looks like! Good partners pick up the slack when the other is overwhelmed.\n\nJust tonight, I made dinner. We usually have an agreement that whoever didn't cook clears the dishes. After dinner, my spouse said he needed to finish up something for work, but would deal with the dishes later. I wasn't working and was feeling OK physically, so I saw no reason not to handle the dishes myself. And I didn't brag about it or even mention it later, because it was just a small favor that I happened to be in a position to do. And on days when I'm too drained to get out of bed, he does more than his share as well.", "Nta. The other red flag is your feeling like your\u2019e losing your mind half the time;  his unwillingness to do you a small favor when you regularly do favors he asks for is wearing on you, even if \u201cyou like doing things for him.\u201d He is taking advantage of your kindness but isn\u2019t reciprocating.", "If this request was actually phrased the way OP said \"would you mind...\" then yeah his response is absurd. But I can see other ways where it may have been asked in a less friendly manner. How we communicate matters a lot.", "Yeah that\u2019s probably not a good think. Not saying he\u2019s a piece of garbage but that\u2019s a garbage thing to do you are NTA but he sorta is.", "Omg I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t want to assume anything because I don\u2019t fully know your relationship. But he sounds a bit like a narcissist. Does he pass the blame onto you for a lot of things in your relationship.. never taking accountability?", "He sounds pretty self-centered. People in good relationships in general don't feel the need to either post or apologize about minutiae like this, because it doesn't come up/isn't an issue. They aren't keeping score or wondering if they did the \"wrong\" thing. Take time to view your relationship like an outsider periodically and determine if you like what you see. And whether you like how you feel the vast majority of the time.", "If he has to convince you that he's kind by listing off every kind thing he's ever done for you then he's not kind", "I know we're only seeing a tiny snapshot, but damn, he seems immature and selfish. \n\nYou asked him to \\*put something in the oven.\\* That takes, what? 2 minutes tops? You didn't ask him to go pick up food. You didn't ask him to prepare a meal from scratch....\n\nI would think hard about what life would be like with someone who thinks you're \"too demanding of his time\" when you simply \\*ask him to put something in the oven.\\*\n\nI dated a guy who, when I stayed at his house, would do his dishes, but not mine. If I had a coffee cup in the sink, for instance, he would leave it there for me to wash, even as he washed his dishes from the day. It was tiny tit-for-tat scorekeeping like that that showed me how different we are as people. If I'm going to do the dishes, I'm going to do the dishes, not separate them out by who used them. I'm more of a \"I'll get it today, you get it tomorrow, it all shakes out in the end\" kind of girl.\n\nSo that reaction from you BF is a huge red flag to me about what life would be like with him. I can understand him saying \"Hey, I'm in the middle of a level, I'll do it in a few minutes.\" That's fine. But to come have a talk with you about how demanding you are? Nah. FOH with that.", "That is not even **remotely** where the problem is.", "So he is a selfish AH?", "Seriously? Sounds like he's treating you like a sibling and not like a partner. \n\nThat's the kind of shit my siblings and I would do to each other. \n\n\"Pass the remote, I wanna watch [TV Show].\"\n\n\"Oh? Well I have the remote, so we're watching what I wanna watch!\" \n\n*\n\n\"Close the door on your way out.\"\n\n\"No, I think I'll leave it all the way open.\"\n\n*\n\n\"Can you toss another hot dog on the grill for me?\"\n\n\"If you want food, cook it yourself!\"", "You are seriously brainwashed. You had a brief moment of sanity then you wrote to Reddit, but now your programming is taking over. You need therapy to get over your insecurity. This guy is emotionally abusive.", "No worries! \n\nI used it specifically because the boyfriend is a manager. I know people who are managers who are used to bossing people around and don\u2019t like it when they\u2019re told/asked to do something themselves. It\u2019s not everyone, absolutely, but I was thinking about it in terms he might understand, if she wanted to come at him by saying \u201cI\u2019m not your employee\u201d.", "Please tell us that A) he makes dinner every other day and B) he\u2019s handsome and well endowed enough to sustain this relationship. Because you sound like his indentured servant. NTA", "NTA. This dude is gaslighting tf out of you. Why are you with him? \"funny and good looking\" doesn't make a partner. That's why you stay with your high school boyfriend, and then you break up with him when you realize he's an AH where it really matters in spite of those \"good\" qualities.", "Why TF should you apologise for asking him to do the bare minimum of adulting? Does he do ANYTHING around the house?\n\nNTA. If he can't do something easy to help his SO out, he's putting himself first in a big way.", "NTA. My goal was to raise my son to be self- sufficient and to be compassionate. For me it was vitally important to raise a son that would treat his significant other as an equal.", "NTA. You had no reason to apologize. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a great as you say he is. He doesn\u2019t seem to treat you well in this case- he\u2019s relaxing, you\u2019re busy, and he can\u2019t be bothered to take a few minutes to preheat an oven and put a dish in so you can eat? Does this sound normal to you? \n\nHe has told you not to ask him to do things? You deserve better. Also, stop doing things when he asks you to- tell him you don\u2019t want him to ask you to do anything anymore. Better yet, leave him and find someone who treats you better.", "Hate to tell you, but this is not what a good partner does. It\u2019s absolutely insane to me that you\u2019d refuse this basic kind gesture for *anyone you lived with.* NTA", "NTA but\u2026 are you not entitled to breaks?", "NTA. His behavior is not the way to treat someone you love.", "If, as you say,  you really feel he pulls his own weight on working I'm going to vote NAH.  I would change one thing, I would warn him ahead of time.  I hate to be right in the middle of something and get interrupted with something that has to be done right this minute.  And I get snappy if someone wants me to hop to it like I'm on call.  So I try very hard to ask for help the same way I'd like to be asked.  Namely, \"sometime in the next 20 minutes would you please do this.\"  or \"At your next stopping spot would you help with this?\"", "Ummm     NTA, but he kinda is", "I love when they perfectly describe their bf/gf then explain how immature and lazy they are. They are great butttttttttttt\u2026..lol if you are going to eat the food, then you need to help cook or wash dishes. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if that\u2019s soooooo difficult for his fragile self then he can go hungry.", "NTA but what kind of controlling person are you with? You're worried about bothering him with doing something that you both would benefit from, even though he's playing video games and you're working your butt off? He's got you exactly where he wants you. You're even worried about annoying him with something that he should do anyways. \n\nSure, he doesn't have to do anything at all to help, but he should. Isn't that what a partnership is about? He obviously thinks he's too good to help with stupid little woman chores like dinner. I'd take this as a warning. I'm sure you believe he's all those things you wrote about him, but from what you've said here, it sounds to me like you're trying to make him sound greater than he really is.", "NTA\n\nIf he's not working and only playing games, why can't he help you out by making it easier for you to work yet still be able to eat as well?\n\nI'd be re-evaluating my entire relationship because I'm betting this isn't the only area where he's acting like a jerk.", "Girl. Reread what you just wrote and pretend your friend told you this. You'd tell her that this guy is gaslighting her into silence and submission and she deserves way better, right? That he has convinced you you need to apologize for ASKING HIM TO STAND UP FROM HIS HOURS-LONG VIDEO GAME MARATHON AND PUT SOMETHING IN THE OVEN? Friend, this is not a good person. Cut your losses before he becomes physically abusive. Because that's the natural progression from his current behavior.", "Yeah. Because that\u2019s how men talk to women", "Hello, boyfriend", "And as we all know, video games are more important than work", "Him listing off his past kindnesses is scorekeeping. That is not something a truly kind person does to their partner.", "I am married to a smart, funny, attractive man (in my opinion!) - he has absolutely zero issue with helping me when I ask. We both WFH primarily (in equally busy/not busy depending on the day type Jobs). On a daily basis he does things from \u201chey you\u2019re going to the kitchen can you fill up my water bottle?\u201d To \u201ccan you drop off the Amazon returns?\u201d Without batting an eye. We help each other be successful.", " NTA at all; my bf made me food in the oven tonight while I literally sat on Reddit on my phone. And he\u2019s not like a super homey person who does all the cooking or anything (we mostly eat out). And you don\u2019t owe an apology for asking him to do something!", "This is absolutely not true, and frankly I have no idea why people would want it to be. Especially given how our economy is structured.", "And if he won\u2019t have this conversation with you-that\u2019s telling you he isn\u2019t ever going to be a supportive partner.", "Eh. Guys like this will just deny ever having done that, then redirect it to accuse OP of being crazy or dramatic or emotional. There is no \"walking a mile in someone else's shoes\" for narcissistic people. They are solely concerned with what they will get out of it.\n\nGood luck, OP. Speaking from similar experiences, get out now - it's gonna get worse.", "But he apparently keeps a mental list of the times he was kind to her.", "That's easy - because he's trained her not to ask.", "Heck, when I was sick with the flu, I asked my disabled partner if he would go to the truck stop at midnight or so to get me some saltine crackers in sub zero temperatures and he went, and even got me a treat for when I started feeling better. The cold seriously mucks with his mobility and causes extreme pain. I apologized for asking him to go out and he told me not to be an idiot.\n\nThis dude tho... yeah, like wtf", "NTA and also ya'll need to have a large conversation about infringing on and demanding of the other person's time before children are brought into the mix.", "NTA. He is TA. Stop doing things for him, even if he asks. Tell him you don't want to. \n\nFYI, it shouldn't annoy him when you ask him to do something for you. He sounds like a teenager. \"But mommmm... I don't wanna!\"", "do you two even like eachother? NTA", "WTF OP! YNTA! I would be seriously cautious about moving forward, he sounds controlling and a bit of a bully.  Then his response sounds bullying.  Where are you on his priority list?  Clearly below gaming and laying around.\n\nAre you so codependent you're afraid to ask a simple favor?", "NTA. He is being a jerk. How 'does not like me asking him to do stuff' does this even work in a relationship?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "He's TA. If I have a busy day at work my partner won't even need to be asked. He will run my bath and bring me up a coffee, then put tea (dinner) on for me, himself and my daughter, or just me if i am scheduled to come home late. He never has to be asked. Same as if I get a day off or i have a less busy day I'll just start cooking because it gives him a break. He is a stay at home stepdad and I'm greatfull that we are able to have our family structured the way it is, life is great when you share responsibility. I'm sorry to say but that behaviour is a giant red flag, your having a hard day and he can't take 2 mins away from his game to make sure you have something to eat? That's a hard no from me and I'd be monitoring his behaviour very closely to watch for more signs and I'd be getting divorce papers ready\n\nEdited because only welsh people call dinner tea \ud83d\ude02", "NTA and I\u2019ve been in a relationship with a man like this. I wasn\u2019t aware of how messed up it was until it ended. I think you should dump him.", "You\u2019re not the asshole, he is. Seems like such a trivial request. I\u2019d understand if he said he needed 5-10 minutes to do it, video games can be like movies, where you\u2019ve invested considerable time into a story and there might be some cutscene or something that can\u2019t be paused, or perhaps he\u2019s playing a competitive online game, that also can\u2019t be paused, but the outright refusal is just bizarre and makes him seem very uncaring about you. The fact that he then tried to manipulate you into thinking it was you with the problem, is worrying as well.", "NTA. This is a big red flag.", "NTA. He sounds like my dad. There's one rule for him, and another rule for you. He is manipulating and gaslighting you into thinking it's unreasonable for you to ask him to do something when it's perfectly acceptable for him to ask you to do things.", "OP - run. dont walk, run. you are being gaslit and manipulated in so many ways in this post. my very recent ex was just like this and i didnt realize how bad it was until it was too late and i was hurt beyond belief. save yourself the pain, op. NTA.", "I don't know if there's psychology behind this or it's just something I've noticed through my experiences in life so I guess take my comment with a grain of salt, OP. \n\nBut your post *started* with saying my bf is mostly great bc \"xyz\" before you listed the reasons why he's not. Just something about the tracking of the characteristics of what makes him a good person or a good partner and the listing of them straightaway makes me think you're trying to convince yourself. You're counting the reasons you *should* stay or not be upset bc you know the reasons you shouldn't are actually much greater.", "exactly!! How dare you tell the manager what to do! He\u2019s the manager! He\u2019s the boss not you!", "When you're working and he's not, it's not unreasonable for him to make/bring you food and drink. This person is supposed to love you.", "Yes! It literally was like a 20 second task- first I thought she meant make dinner, but then realised it was just put something in the oven! How hard is that? My 10 year old niece will do that for my sister when she works late."]}
