My sister is a single mother with an almost 4 year old daughter. She doesn't live in the same state as me but when she comes back to visit she usually stays with family. This time she stayed with me and I was fine with it. I love my niece and sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI struggle with anxiety and getting started with the day. I can be anxious about getting to work so every morning I wear earphones and listen to music while I get ready. I would just play music but out of respect for my neighbors I don't. My sister was here for about a week and every morning getting ready for work I still put on my headphones and do everything. I will be in the kitchen making breakfast with headphones on so for that hour I take getting ready I can't hear her or my niece. My sister for some reason would SEE me in headphones and still try to talk to me as if I could hear. Like she'd walk in and I'd see her looking at me and her lips moving. She'd just be talking at a normal volume as if I could hear. Like who sees someone in headphones and just starts talking? The first couple times I would them off for a second and say \"I can't hear you, listening to music\" and she'd nod and then I'd put them back on. But like a few minutes later she'd do it again. At that point I just would continue doing what I was doing and not respond. I assumed she'd get the message. Then she'd tap me on the shoulder and I'd take them off. I'd expect it to be something serious that needs addressing but it'd usually just be some mundane thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe also would just let my niece be in the apartment and kitchen and be off in the bathroom or somewhere else. My niece is pretty well behaved and she isn't one of those kids where you look away for a second and they are doing something crazy. But still a child should be watched because she does get into something sometimes. She would be like \"I'm gonna get ready\" and just walk somewhere else. Obviously I don't hear it. I have my back turned and am in the kitchen. 20 minutes later she'd come out and ask if I was even watching. I told her that this one hour in the morning I wear headphones while I get ready. After work or any other time I don't. She said that it was mean because she has a kid. I told her \"you get ready every morning in your house without me or another person there. do that here.\" She thought it was rude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I am off we talk a lot. I interact and played with my niece tons. I don't think it's crazy for that one hour while getting ready to be mine.

People who are visiting you expect to interact with you when they're in the same space, and it's generally considered rude to ignore them. And what you said to her was extremely rude. I'm sure she won't stay with you again, you very clearly signalled you care only about yourself and refuse to engage even in basic social interaction. As someone who also suffers from anxiety, it does not give you license to completely subordinate the world to your needs. Wearing headphones when someone is around is rude in general unless you're working.", "This could've been avoided with some direct communication I think. Your sister is not wrong for thinking it's rude to just ignore the guest in your house. You're not wrong for wanting to keep the morning routine that works best for you. So you should've bluntly said to her, \"I know it may come off as rude and I'm sorry, but I REALLY need this one hour in the morning to mentally prepare myself for the day. It has nothing to do with you and I love having you as a guest, but it's just this one hour please.\"", "NTA. Don't listen to all those who call you TA. You're not. \nYour sister can't simply tell you \"I'm getting ready\" (what for btw? Visiting your family?) and then expect you to watch her child while you're getting ready for work. Also, she should respect your morning routine. It's not as if you were putting on headphones to annoy or exclude her, you NEED them for your anxiety. I totally get that, I wouldn't be able to use public transport without my headphones.", "NTA. You're doing them a favor by letting them stay there. The least she can do is give you an hour's peace (and routine) each day.", " NTA but I just want to point out that parents can leave a 4yo in an apartment while they go to the bathroom or another room in the apartment without the kid needing a babysitter.", "YTA. What kind of host (and sister) intentionally ignores somebody for an hour? Why even have her stay with you when you have no intention to talk to them?", "INFO: How long is this visit? What time are you getting ready for work? \n\nSounds like ESH right now. She should be watching her own kid or at least asking you to watch her. But unless your sister is staying over long-term, as a host you should be willing to make minor adjustments to your routine.", "YTA\nIf you don't have time to talk, tell them you don't have time to talk. But if you do have time, and someone is trying to talk to you, it's rude AF to essentially say \"sorry, this music I'm listening to is more important than whatever you might be saying.\" Which is exactly what you're saying to her, when you see she's speaking to you, respond that you can't hear her, and then go right back to your music.\n\nAnd yes, when you invite a child to stay in your home, you now bear some of the responsibility for that child. Ignoring them also makes YTA and incredibly irresponsible.", "One hour per day, five days a week. There are 168 hours in a week, and OP has headphones in for just under 3% of them. That is hardly unreasonable or selfish.", "Yes", "I tell them good morning and all the niceties but I'm also in a rush and getting ready for work. On the weekend for example I didn't mind because I had nowhere to be. I was just lounging and talking. But during the week I was going through the steps of getting ready and getting to work on time. It's literally a single hour", "I don't think a single hour in the morning while getting ready and trying to get out on time and be mentally prepared for work is a lot to ask. I talk to them after work. Did you read the post? \"No intention to talk to them\" It's a single hour", "While is true OP was their host, it was just one hour while OP was getting ready for work, but sister was a huge mean AH, she purposely left her own kid unsupervised knowing OP didn't heard her since was using headphones like usual. Moreover sister doesn't respected OP, OP deals with anxiety and sister knows. \n\nOP NTA", "It was a week. I was getting ready at 7 to leave at 8. After work and in my off time I was all in. I don't think needing a single hour is selfish", "I interact and talked with them after work and all weekend. Just that one hour before work while getting ready I didn't. Idk why you're making it seem like I was ignoring them the whole time they were there. We literally talked and drank wine every night until we went to bed", "Then NTA.\nYou informed her about your needs and she decided to ignore it, so it was her who leave the kid unattended.\n\nI think that your sister was expecting that for the time she was visiting you focus all the attention to them, but from the moment you expressed that ypu needes some time alone she should have respect it.", "This extra details puts this in the NTA category. I will add though that house guests throw off one's routine so it's predictable that the morning routine would be messed up during sister and niece's stay. House guests, even beloved ones, have a way of wearing out their welcome fast.", "It isn\u2019t. NTA", "It doesn't matter what you did the rest of the time. What matters is how incredibly rude you were at that time. Because the issue wasn't that \"you couldn't hear them,\" it was that you didn't have time to talk to or watch them in that hour. And that's not wrong, but THAT'S what you needed to say them to avoid looking like a rude AF AH.", "After work and on the weekend I was focused on them", "are you slow ? she\u2019s getting ready for work ! SHE DOESN\u2019T HAVE TIME TO TALK. She explained that to her sister already. She\u2019s trynna get her shit done so she can get out the door and into work on time. like y\u2019all are really miserable as hell"]}
