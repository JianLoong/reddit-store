I met fiance while we were both working for the same company. He was full-time, I was a contractor.\n\nMy pay was lower than the full-timers, so I was looking for a new job throughout & quit after I was offered a better paid one.\n\n When I left, I encouraged my fiance to find a new job too. He did, and found one that paid the same as mine ($30/hr).\n\nThat new role didn't work out, (company expected a lot more than job description said & didnt pay enough for what was being asked + constant stress and last minute OT. They thought I wasnt working hard enough), I was fired, but found another role that also didn't work out.\n\nAfter, I was unemployed for a few mos. I had savings and got unemployment, so was not relying on fiance financially, but $ was still tight. He paid for a lot of groceries, and covered the cost if we went out. \n\nMeanwhile, fiances new job had been going great, but IMO, they ask & expect too much from him for his current pay, so I've been encouraging him to find something better (he's more shy abt change & hates job hunting). \n\n4 months ago, after 2.5 mos unemployed, I got a new job that paid SIGNIFICANTLY better than any of my prior ones, and fiances (115k).  I love the job, its been going great. Since, Ive been paying my share , &treating us more often when we go out. \n\nA month after I started my job, fiances company closed.\n\nSince then, hes been hunting/interviewing, and has been offered THREE new jobs, but turned ALL of them down. Why? Because they don't pay as well as mine.\n\nHes also self-sabotaged a few of his interviews by asking for hourly pay that would be equal to mine (though his niche/role type in our industry isnt paid as high), so some jobs hes been qualified for/had good interviews for didnt go any further b/c he was asking too much. \n\nLast week he was offered a THIRD job (85k, A LOT for the role type), I was strongly encouraging him to take it, and he got frustrated, saying it wasn't fair for me to be pushing him to take a lower-paying job than mine & implying that I wanted to feel superior.\n\n I said I didn't care about that, and that he should just accept it, since its more than he was making before, and REALLY good pay for his particular nice/role type. He got upset, saying that he deserved to be making just as much, and it wasnt fair for me to insist he settle for less.\n\nAITA for encouraging him to take it? He's not in bad financial distress at this point, BUT hes anxious about unemployment and dipping into savings, & I dont want to end up having to bear the financial burden later on, AND he's unlikely to find a role similar to his old one that pays what mine in a COMPLETELY different area of the industry is.

Was it insensitive of me to try and tell him he should have just taken the last job he was offered, when I'm not in the same financial boat?\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He's letting his ego get in the way of actually providing any value to your collective living situation.\n\nI'd keep track of this because if he's going to get all insecure and pouty every time you're making more than him he might not be a good fit. This is not a characteristic of a good man or partner.", "NTA. If he holds out for an unrealistic ask he\u2019s going to keep being unhappy job hunting a lot longer. It sounds like he\u2019s got some internalized issues tied to his pay and your pay that he should really look at.", "Sounds like your fiance has some insecurities. Maybe you need to change your approach here and help him be more self assured and understanding that his worth as a person and partner aren't determined by his income.\n\nOh and NTA.", "NTA.   \nTaking a job does not mean you are stuck for life - he is stressed out with his financials and unemployment, and depending on the job, he may be losing skills related to that field the longer he sits unemployed. A job pay that is lower with higher personal/outside life satisfaction is pay in itself. A higher paying job will demand more, may be taking a greater toll on mental health and the work-life balance...that should be a factor in any employment opportunity if it is important to you. \n\nTaking the job will continue his resume, networking, and there may be other opportunities within that job/company/field later through the connections made in this role. \n\nHis mindset about the power imbalance is concerning and needs to be addressed. Does he feel less in the relationship if you bring home more - what was his attitude when you were earning less, was he holding that over you, did he treat you differently...or is it his own insecurity. What happens if he gets sick and you need to look after him, or he is unable to continue in this field at all? There is a much larger conversation that needs to happen regarding the dynamic in your relationship, his insecurity and what your future will look like in general.", "NTA He should take the job and look for an other one if money bothers him, but 85k income is infinitely more than 0k income. That is the stone hard math here. Also, it feels like he is far from reality. You 2 should talk about what is his problem exactly. Because it seems like he feels inferior if he gets less salary and that alone is a bad sign for me however he has to come clean about his exact problem.", "NTA, leave the deadbeat", "NTA. Your fiance is insecure and thinks his income relates directly to his manliness. He currently has no job. He needs to take one of these decent jobs he's been offered - nobody is going to magically offer him more money just because you make more."]}
