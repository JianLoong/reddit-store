Not only am I MOH, I\u2019m also planning the entire wedding. Too many details give my sister anxiety so she\u2019s entrusted all of the planning to me. Basically my sister will tell me what she wants and I will make it happen. My parents are paying for the entire wedding.\n\nLast week my sister gave me a list of wedding guests to review to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anyone and I immediately got flustered when I saw she wanted to invite two of our family friends of 20 years, we\u2019ll call them Sarah and Jeff. My parents met Sarah and Jeff 20 years ago through our church and I became very close friends with their daughter \u201cMelissa\u201d. Melissa and I remained the best of friends for almost 15 years but suddenly things changed and Melissa became a really crappy friend. Long story short: I was always there for her and she was never there for me. Whenever I confronted Melissa, she always claimed it had nothing to do with me, this was just the way she was now. It hurt me deeply and I\u2019ve kept my distance ever since.  Sarah and Jeff are wonderful people and I have nothing against them. It\u2019s just that being around them makes me uncomfortable at times because I have to pretend their daughter didn\u2019t hurt me. My sister is having a micro wedding so I wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid them. \n\nI know if I told my sister I would rather she not invite them, she would immediately take them off the list because she loves me. I do t want to take advantage of that though. She\u2019s not very close to them. She just thinks they\u2019re nice people and it would be a kind gesture to invite them. I also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to bring this up because the wedding is in a different state and Sarah and Jeff might decide not to come. So WIBTA if I asked her not to invite Sarah and Jeff?", "created_utc": 1668543733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw8fjo/wibta_if_i_asked_my_sister_not_to_invite_two/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not your wedding plus they did nothing wrong.", "Yeah, YWBTA. \n\nSounds like your sister is in charge of the guest list. That means that inviting them is what she wants, for whatever reason. Given she's having a microwedding, every last person on that list is probably pretty important to her!\n\nAlso, using the \"but I planned your wedding!\" line as leverage to get what you want out of her wedding is the same kind of move that sends the wedding and weddingplanning subreddits into a tizzy... it's just usually parents who feel entitled to pull that stunt because they've paid for everything.

If they are not likely to come, let her invite them and they may send a gift (which i know is kind of a shitty way to look at it, but their daughter hurt you, so whatever).

Normally I'd say let you sister invite whoever she wants, it's her wedding, but you're the one planning the entire thing out of the kindness of your heart (people usually get paid for this....) so I think it's fair for you to have a say in it.\n\nPlus, your sister isn't even close with them and just seems to be inviting them out of politeness. You mentioned it's a micro wedding, so if anybody asks why Sarah/Jeff aren't invited just say you were keeping it small.", "NAH. Really depends on how uncomfortable having Melissa\u2019s parents there makes you.

There\u2019s a way to frame up this story that would make total sense to everyone without including that you\u2019re planning the whole thing for her. My sister knew my guest list because we would talk about it and she helped me with invitations. \n\nYou used it to qualify your selfish ask. Why are you here if you\u2019re going to argue with every single person?", "As the wedding planner and sister of the bride, you inherently have a bit of power. You realize that right? You cannot simply ask as her sister because it\u2019s evident this is a huge favor she\u2019s asked because she doesn\u2019t want the stress of planning. Your request as a sister, will likely feel like a potential implied threat to refuse further help. Do you understand how complicated that makes it for her?\n\nAnd at only 60 people, there likely isn\u2019t a single person on the list the couple doesn\u2019t want there. My husband and I had around 120 and that was with serious consideration!!!", "I still think it\u2019s very inconsiderate to make this request, 1. Because she\u2019s likely gonna feel obligated 2. Because as you\u2019ve said they\u2019re wonderful people & their daughter isn\u2019t even invited. Nobody is forcing you to be around them at the wedding", "Here's the thing: you know she'd cave if you asked, even if it's not what she wanted. You said so yourself.\n\n>I know if I told my sister I would rather she not invite them, she would immediately take them off the list because she loves me. **I do t want to take advantage of that though.**\n\nSo don't. Deep down you know it's a shitty thing to do.", "And also, if it's such a small wedding, she's probably only inviting people that she really wants to be there. OP can't know for sure that she's only inviting them to be nice.", "Excellent, you get to not invited Jeff and Sarah then, and keep the non existent drama going. \n\nYTA. It's a ridiculous reason to not want people at your SISTER'S wedding.", " The guest list has sixty people but because it\u2019s an out of state wedding on a holiday weekend, only 45-50 will probably come. That\u2019s why I described it as a micro wedding. I should have been more clear about that.", "I meant to say that I can accept that I may be TA. That was a typo", "If I wanted sympathy, why would I would I turn to a Reddit? I wanted honesty and I appreciate the honesty of everyone who has commented. The only things I don\u2019t appreciate is people making inferences about me based on things that\u2019s not even in my post. Those are only things I\u2019m pushing back against", "Absolutely agree! OP is willfully ignoring the power dynamics here.", "I\u2019m not arguing with everyone. The only people I\u2019m arguing with are those who are making inferences and assumptions about things that aren\u2019t even in my post. The people who just said YTA and here\u2019s why, I haven\u2019t argued with. I don\u2019t mind the judgement. What I mind is people saying things that aren\u2019t true.", "It has to be *a big thing* if you\u2019re wanting to not in them to avoid it. You are making it *a big thing*", "I'm going to agree, you still need to put your BS to the side. The day isn't about you. If you can't handle the planning, pull out. You're not a martyr. Don't act like one. We've all been where you are, it's not unique to you. You're wanting to uninvite people over hurt feelings because someone changed? I was genuinely reading wonder what had been done to you and was like... uh. What. The level of petty on wanting to uninvite a family over something like that is like Next Generation. Massive YWBTA.", "There are 178 comments here at the moment and all of them consider behavior like yours to be \"acting like a martyr\". You do not ask someone (even as a favor to their sister) to uninvite guests they would like to have there because you would prefer not to see them.", "Ah okay! I didn\u2019t mean to be harsh. But seriously, you love your Sister. Let this go. You will be so busy and occupied taking care of your Sister, you won\u2019t have time for Sarah and Jeff. Just focus on her and you\u2019ll do fine.", "Fool me once\u2026", "You didn\u2019t address most of my comment which says a lot. \n\nEven if you claim you aren\u2019t holding it over her head, I 100% believe subconsciously you feel like you have the right to ask her because you\u2019re planning the wedding. You don\u2019t. I hope you leave it alone.", "She shouldn\u2019t of said it at all", "THIS", "Sarah and Jeff have no bearing on what happened with you and Melissa. And maybe your Sis isn\u2019t that close, but your parents are and they are paying for the Wedding. So your Sister probably invited them out of respect. Again, none of which has anything to do with you.", "I think you need to come up with a thoughtful way to stay them off immediately. Like *I\u2019m very sorry but your daughter and I had a falling out years ago over personal differences and I don\u2019t want to talk about it as this day is to celebrate my sister*. Not inviting them is singling them out and likely to bring more heat than stopping them if they grill you will."]}
