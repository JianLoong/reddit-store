Not only am I MOH, I\u2019m also planning the entire wedding. Too many details give my sister anxiety so she\u2019s entrusted all of the planning to me. Basically my sister will tell me what she wants and I will make it happen. My parents are paying for the entire wedding.\n\nLast week my sister gave me a list of wedding guests to review to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anyone and I immediately got flustered when I saw she wanted to invite two of our family friends of 20 years, we\u2019ll call them Sarah and Jeff. My parents met Sarah and Jeff 20 years ago through our church and I became very close friends with their daughter \u201cMelissa\u201d. Melissa and I remained the best of friends for almost 15 years but suddenly things changed and Melissa became a really crappy friend. Long story short: I was always there for her and she was never there for me. Whenever I confronted Melissa, she always claimed it had nothing to do with me, this was just the way she was now. It hurt me deeply and I\u2019ve kept my distance ever since.  Sarah and Jeff are wonderful people and I have nothing against them. It\u2019s just that being around them makes me uncomfortable at times because I have to pretend their daughter didn\u2019t hurt me. My sister is having a micro wedding so I wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid them. \n\nI know if I told my sister I would rather she not invite them, she would immediately take them off the list because she loves me. I do t want to take advantage of that though. She\u2019s not very close to them. She just thinks they\u2019re nice people and it would be a kind gesture to invite them. I also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to bring this up because the wedding is in a different state and Sarah and Jeff might decide not to come. So WIBTA if I asked her not to invite Sarah and Jeff?", "created_utc": 1668543733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw8fjo/wibta_if_i_asked_my_sister_not_to_invite_two/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not your wedding plus they did nothing wrong.", "Yeah, YWBTA. \n\nSounds like your sister is in charge of the guest list. That means that inviting them is what she wants, for whatever reason. Given she's having a microwedding, every last person on that list is probably pretty important to her!\n\nAlso, using the \"but I planned your wedding!\" line as leverage to get what you want out of her wedding is the same kind of move that sends the wedding and weddingplanning subreddits into a tizzy... it's just usually parents who feel entitled to pull that stunt because they've paid for everything.

If they are not likely to come, let her invite them and they may send a gift (which i know is kind of a shitty way to look at it, but their daughter hurt you, so whatever).

Normally I'd say let you sister invite whoever she wants, it's her wedding, but you're the one planning the entire thing out of the kindness of your heart (people usually get paid for this....) so I think it's fair for you to have a say in it.\n\nPlus, your sister isn't even close with them and just seems to be inviting them out of politeness. You mentioned it's a micro wedding, so if anybody asks why Sarah/Jeff aren't invited just say you were keeping it small.", "NAH. Really depends on how uncomfortable having Melissa\u2019s parents there makes you.

You cannot simply ask as her sister because it\u2019s evident this is a huge favor she\u2019s asked because she doesn\u2019t want the stress of planning. Your request as a sister, will likely feel like a potential implied threat to refuse further help. Do you understand how complicated that makes it for her?\n\nAnd at only 60 people, there likely isn\u2019t a single person on the list the couple doesn\u2019t want there. My husband and I had around 120 and that was with serious consideration!!!", "I still think it\u2019s very inconsiderate to make this request, 1. Because she\u2019s likely gonna feel obligated 2.

I have been estranged from our father for 12 years, while she has remained in contact with him. He was invited to the wedding. It never even occurred to me to ask her to not invite him. At the wedding I made polite conversation, introduced him to his grandchildren, even encouraged my children to speak to him as much or as little as they wanted, I drove him back to the hotel after the rehearsal dinner, even posed for wedding photos with him.  My relationship with him was not magically fixed. We haven't spoken since and I've made peace with the knowledge that that may very well be the last time I see him in this life. So why did I bother?  Because it was my problem, not my sister's; and her wedding was not the time or place to deal with my issues.\n\nYour feelings about the end of your friendship are valid. It is even valid to try to avoid her parents in your OWN life. But the wedding isn't about you. For whatever reason, Melissa's parents made the short list of guests your sister wants to celebrate her wedding with. You have no right ask her to change that. Plus, as MOH you will have plenty to do the day of the wedding. You likely won't even need to speak to them beyond a passing hello.", "YTA\n\nYou can be uncomfortable with certain people, but unless they have done something to hurt you personally, someone else's wedding day is not the time or place to suggest they be excluded.\n\nAlso, 60 people is not a micro wedding. It's small, but you will absolutely not have to interact with these people beyond a \"Hi, how are you?\". If you can't handle that to people who, as far as you say in your post, have never actually done anything wrong except be *related* to someone who has treated you poorly in the past, you've got much bigger issues to sort out.\nI had a micro wedding, as in literally less than 20 people, including officiant/photographer/wedding planner/catering staff.

I suspect this is one of the few betrayals you have experienced. Don't pay too much attention to all us jaded redditors.\n\nBut as a jaded redditor, I think you need to open yourself up to the idea of talking to your former friend one day. She may have a story you need to hear. My bff and I had a fight and didn't speak for 5 years. When we saw each other again, it was like a dam broke. I had long forgiven her, and had asked her to forgive me. But it wasn't until I hugged her that she believed me. She died a few years later, but I'm glad I had that time with her.\n\nAnyway, seeing your former friend's parents in this setting might be a way to start easing yourself in to the next part of your journey. If you can't figure out how to move past your hurt and grief, you should try talking to a therapist. It's not good to walk around with those feelings.", "NAH.

Seriously, as a major part of the wedding, you have the best excuse to avoid any awkwardness by simply having an important task you need to get to. Right now. You can invent one if you have to. That means that any conversations you have with them can stick to a few superficial hellos before you run off to ask the caterers when they are bringing out the first dish or whatever.

They are paying and probably do want them to be invited. I think the best way to move forward is to stop letting other people have this kind of power over you.

Asking her not to invite them because you\u2019re irrationally uncomfortable is ridiculous. Grow up.", "Look, to be perfectly blunt it sounds like you have a martyrdom problem. Honestly ask yourself whether you seek praise for/enjoy being perceived as self-sacrificing for the benefit of others. Here\u2019s some examples:\n\n- I\u2019m struggling with planning the whole wedding for my sister, especially on top of law school, but I MUST do it for my sister because it would be too much for her and I will shoulder this burden for her at my own expense \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n\n- This girl is horrid to me, acknowledges she\u2019s being horrid to me, but continues to be horrid to me. Instead of cutting her off I must always welcome her back in, despite my continual hurt, because I must be the bigger person and do the \u2018right\u2019 thing no matter the personal cost \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n\n- Oh it\u2019s just so hard for me to see her parents right now because I\u2019m back in the negative stage of my messed up friendship, I know I normally suffer so silently that my sister might not realise it, but should I make this into a big issue and ask her to not invite them? She would do it, because she acknowledges how I\u2019m already sacrificing so much to help her plan the wedding and she appreciates me so much. It probably wouldn\u2019t even bother her that much since she knows how hard I always try \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n\n- I know they\u2019re not responsible for why I\u2019m hurt but the situations I keep inviting on myself are just SO hard and instead of doing anything to fix it privately within myself I want to make a big deal out of it during wedding planning and bring it to everyone\u2019s attention (making sure to tell them how self-sacrificing and secretly suffering I have been the whole time) \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\n\nAlso ask yourself why you\u2019re bringing this up now. Have you been feeling like your family is overlooking you at the moment? Or not appreciating everything you\u2019re doing? Because it\u2019s kind of a weird thing to suddenly spring on them (since this stuff with the \u2018friend\u2019 has been ongoing for awhile now but this seems to be the first time seeing the parents - who you apparently see all the time at church and as family friends) are too much for you. Is this a way to bring attention back to you and receive praise and comfort for how self-sacrificing and generous you are, even though the burdens you choose to carry are all SO hard and you\u2019re secretly struggling SO much?\n\nEdit: Wait, your sister can\u2019t have a wedding planner because she\u2019s so scared of strangers she can\u2019t even handle emailing in a professional setting? And instead of getting her therapy to help or finding go arounds (such as her soon-to-husband, whose wedding it also is, doing the communicating) everyone is going \u2018poor sweet thing, we must enable her to keep living in her bubble and never help her grow\u2019 \ud83d\ude14 Does your whole church have a victimhood thing going on?? That would explain the former friend, she got so sick of people making victims of themselves over nothing she decided she must as well be an arsehole anyway, since the same thing happens either way. She\u2019s still an arsehole for doing it, but I\u2019d love to know her side. Pure speculation of course, but it does fit in well with how you\u2019ve described yourself and others.", "I hate when people make this comment for the likes, but I\u2019m being serious when I say I\u2019m getting some odd feelings here that OP build the friend an art room and got upset when she choose to paint somewhere else.", "It hasn\u2019t been 15 years. We were best friends for 15 years, our friendship broke down 5 years ago when she suddenly started treating me like crepes for no apparent reason.

Grow up and just walk away when you see her coming. \n\nBut if the issue is more so that Sarah specifically treats you badly then yeah, you\u2019re allowed to have feelings about her being there. \nStill not a good idea to tell your sister to take them off the list unless Sarah would cause a scene or seek you out to start an argument. \nThe best solution is still to just avoid them as much as possible, but if Sarah, who I\u2019m assuming is 50+, has beef with you even though it\u2019s HER daughter that\u2019s in the wrong, then she\u2019s a weirdo and she DEFINITELY needs to grow the hell up.", "The wedding planning guides I\u2019ve read describe micro weddings as 50 people or less. So many venues told me that they couldn\u2019t accommodate the wedding because they don\u2019t do micro weddings. I\u2019m just going by the information that has been presented to me.", "You\u2019re on AITA literally asking people to make a judgement about your character. Stop whining.", "*shouldn\u2019t have", "A micro wedding is like under 20 guests. You don\u2019t get to change definitions just to get your way.", "So you\u2019re saying that she doesn\u2019t like you anymore but she always manages to be kind to your parents\u2026..", "I don\u2019t think they dislike me. I think that Sarah in particular doesn\u2019t don\u2019t know how to act around me now that Melissa and I aren\u2019t friends. I haven\u2019t treated them any differently because I think they\u2019re good people. Sarah acts like I make her uncomfortable which is weird since she said she knows what happened between Melissa and I wasn\u2019t her fault", "The more you comment, the more unwell you sound. Just manage yourself, handle the discomfort. I can guarantee you these people aren't sitting around thinking about you. Stop obsessing over them. \n\nThe only rational explanations I can think of for your bizarre attitude are that the church you mention is really extreme and insular and this is really about cult politics or that you've literally never experienced even the mildest discomfort in your life and that's why you think being in the same event as people you vaguely feel awkward around sounds like an actual struggle to you.", "No, but you and the girl you\u2019re obsessed with don\u2019t get along anymore. And yet, and this is/was my point, she manages to be kind to your parents when she sees them (you said this). I was trying to point out that perhaps you should follow your toxic friend\u2019s example and just be kind to her parents when you see them because that is what people do. Including the girl who you are obsessed with, evidently. According to you.", "Did she sleep with your bf? Did she sleep with your dad? Did she run over your cat? Did she write your name in the burn book?", "You know absolutely nothing about me so you have absolutely no right to make these kind of assumptions. I come from a very educated and I\u2019m an educated woman myself. The churches my family and I attend are mainstream and non extreme. I have had my fair share of serious trauma and I\u2019ve gotten help for it. If you want to talk about my sister\u2019s wedding, we can talk a knot that but please leave my life and my experiences out of it.", "I wasn\u2019t referring to my friend. I was referring to her parents. Her parents are kind to my parents, but they act uncomfortable around me. Melissa hasn\u2019t seen my parents in two years and the last time she saw them she was pretty rude to my dad."]}
