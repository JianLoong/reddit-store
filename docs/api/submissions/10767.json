We were aware my daughter was soon to pop, but her due date wasn\u2019t until the end of this month, mind you these events took place in the beginning of this month. \n\nWe told him that was impossible, and just to follow their birthing plan and to keep us updated. A few hours later we got a call from my daughter updating us then asking when we\u2019d be on our way back and that she really wanted us to be here and that it was taken longer then expected, she was scared, etc. She\u2019s a first time mom so it was expected for her to be scared. My wife and I assured her everything would be fine, but we were unable to just pack up and go. She got upset and hung up on me.\n\nHours later in the middle of the night we missed a call due to us sleeping and it was her boyfriend saying there was complications and they were performing emergency c section. The next morning we called immediately and our daughter told us she was scared and things could\u2019ve went bad and our Cancun trip was more important to us then her, then hung up. We tried to call back but she wouldn\u2019t answer.\n\nThe baby was born healthy and our daughter is okay.

I think it sucks that you weren\u2019t calling to check in/slept through something major. It\u2019s so great that her and the baby are okay, but with an emergency surgery things could have gone a very different way. If my mom was away and couldn\u2019t get to me when I was in labor, she would be constantly calling/texting to make sure everything was going okay and she\u2019d make sure she could answer her phone in case there was an emergency. I would do the same for my babies.. maybe it\u2019s a family thing or a culture thing? But i do think she would\u2019ve felt more supported if you had at least checked in more/answered when there was an emergency. It\u2019s a tough situation all around.

That\u2019s the true issue, not that you were on vacation. This is an easy fix so try to be patient and understanding with her feelings. I had covid when delivering my child and was in labor for 18 hours before I had an emergency c section as well. My parents couldn\u2019t be at the hospital but they were in constant communication with us the entire time. They stayed up all night until the baby was born. It made me feel safe.

Also, a C section is always possible even if not planned.  Life happens and this time it turned out your daughter needed one.\n\nYour daughter & son in law are adults and while perhaps are disappointed that you could not be there for the birth, they  (particularly your daughter) needs to get off their selfish butts.   They are the ones entering the world of parenting.  You and your wife have already been there and done that job.  You had no obligation to be there for the birth and you have nothing to apologize for - so stop doing it! \n\nThe daughter needs to calm down.  She isn't the first person to give birth without her parents nearby.  If she continues to refuse to speak with you and your wife - fine. It is her loss.

I personally believe that your parent will always be your parent and you\u2019ll always need them in some capacity, it\u2019s not wrong of her to want her parents when she\u2019s terrified and facing childbirth, and it sounds like she clutched to the familiar-the birth plan and she wanted her mum.", "No one\u2019s saying they should never go on vacation but when you find out your family is having a medical emergency choosing to stay and drink at the beach is an ah move.", "Easy.

This baby was born premature with a difficult birth. It's very fragile health-wise and has nearly no immune system developed yet. \n\nOP and his wife had spent a week in a tourist town in a foreign country and would have taken a crowded plane there and back. Either one of those facts mean that even if they had dropped everything, it would not have been safe to see mother or baby for several days at the very least. It's peak cold/flu/covid season. I wouldn't let them near a medically fragile newborn for a few weeks.\n\nETA: I keep thinking of other points. The daughter was recovering from fairly serious abdominal surgery.

We had two attending midwives, one for me one for my son). My sister was there mostly to help my oldest if he woke up, but basically it was all hands on deck at push time, as I was essentially floating and had someone one each limb pushing back against me haha. \n\nAnyways, we are indigenous and matriarchal culturally.

A lot of people wouldn\u2019t want their parents at the hospital while they give birth, c-section or no c-section. And the parents probably got a lot of sun and being exposed to the sun for long periods of time wears you out.

Especially when you are on a very-well-planned vacation and are not a part of the birthing plan. I probably could not have slept, and it\u2019s the only part I feel less assured about, but I still think the idea of childbirth has become wayyyyy too much of an \u201cinstagram event ritual\u201d thing, and expectations between generations are skewed.", "Again most hospitals have a 1 person policy, do you really expect your parents to sit in the waiting room for HOURS \ud83d\ude43 ?

I find that odd and a little cold? \n\nI'm saying that as someone who would not want my parents in the delivery room. Yes, you couldn't have physically done anything. Neither will your daughter be able to physically do anything when you're ill. You'll still want her there. Emotional support can be far more important than anything else. I'm not saying her expectations are reasonable. I'm not saying you didn't check in. But you didn't mention it, and I'm guessing it's because you didn't. Can you see how someone who is scared and very hormonal who had planned on you being there might feel like they weren't your priority? And that it might have been amplified by your perceived lack of concern? \n\nI see both sides here. NAH.", "You're NTA for not being physically there, you couldn't have known, but after you knew she had a traumatic birth and could have died, you still made no attempts to get to her or even video call?  Plus you're still mentioning several times about how much money you spent and not thinking you did anything wrong. So she's also NTA for not wanting you to see the baby.  When I had my first baby, my dad was on vacation in Germany.   He flew home that night and visited me the next day. Despite being tired and jet-lagged.  I can't imagine how discarded I would have felt if he said \"sorry, paid a lot for this,  you're not as important as my vacation \" and then didn't show up until a week later.   She has every right to feel let down by you,  because you let her down. She will likely never forgive you,  even if she eventually lets you see the kid, so it doesn't matter what a bunch of internet strangers think of whether or not you're the asshole, you damaged her trust in you and the damage is done.", "I think you should have stayed more in contact and been available for middle of the night phone calls - phone not on silent/loud enough to wake you.

Not in the room, but just to know she was there, even if phone calls during labor and after baby was delivered. \n\nI can see why she\u2019s upset. She had a TRAUMATIC birth experience.

Healthy baby and physically healthy mom don\u2019t mean she\u2019s completely ok.", "NTA. But I don't understand why neither of you compromised with taking shifts on a video call to give your daughter support.

Second/third question: have you had a parent pass away, and if so, did you feel a pain like a small child who had lost the only place where they felt the certainty of safety?\nYou may be thinking these questions are awfully dramatic, and maybe so: I don\u2019t know all the details of your daughter\u2019s medical situation. But when I think emergency c-section, I\u2019m thinking \u2018risk to the life of mom/child\u2019 and that\u2019s before we get into how deplorable our maternal health statistics are as a country. And that\u2019s on top of hours of contractions, and her first time experiencing birth, which would\u2019ve been quite possibly the most painful experience of her life to date. We know that extreme pain and fear can make people revert into a childlike state, a la dying soldiers crying out for their mothers. When your psyche is pushed too hard, you crave that feeling of security, if you had it as a child. And I feel like that\u2019s the source of the ongoing coldness your daughter is showing.\nYou\u2019re arguing your absence based on money lost, not being on time anyway, and no medical value to your presence. I think she saw the value of your presence as psychological certainty, a placebo effect sure, but an incredibly powerful one that could reassure her on that deep childlike level that she and her new baby were going to be ok. A partner is excellent, but they can\u2019t replicate that in most cases. And you weren\u2019t there.\nAnd now, she\u2019s going through new motherhood and experiencing all those hormonal feelings of wanting to move mountains for that baby, just to make sure they\u2019re safe and happy. And she\u2019s having to reconcile that with how her own inner child was let down by her parents. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your absence that would sting the most, if it were me; it\u2019s your failure to try. Maybe the airline wouldn\u2019t have switched your tickets if you\u2019d called, and maybe you absolutely couldn\u2019t afford new ones, and maybe you would\u2019ve been too late, and maybe you would\u2019ve just been voices on the phone next to her late that night while the doctors did what they could. But you would\u2019ve tried, and the adult part of her could understand the failure to move mountains. But you didn\u2019t try. And I understand why she wouldn\u2019t want to see or talk to you right now. Bc if I were her, and I interacted with you now, all I could think of would be loss of certainty.", "NTA - you asked if you were the ahole for not immediately heading back. So no. But you are absolutely the ahole if you think there is nothing you and your wife could have provided that the dr can\u2019t. I take that back, maybe not an hole, maybe just really ignorant of the emotional support and reassurance that your presence would have provided. Which is actually sad. She judt had the scariest experience of her life, and a normal birth is said to be the closest to death an average woman will get. And hers did not go smoothly or normally. They don\u2019t do emergency c sections unless the life of the mother and/or the child is in IMMEDIATE risk. So her being upset and scared is normal. Whether it was reasonable of her or not to expect you to be there, at that moment she was a scared person who wanted her parents\u2019 reassurance and it wasn\u2019t there. It is possible that once she recovers fully and the child is ok and not at risk of immune threats she will be able to understand your side and will let you see the kid. But unless you show you actually understand and accept her feelings about her experience, your apologies are probably not going to be believed. I hope you can all work it out, but take the first step and accept her experiences and feelings in the moment and stop only looking at the end result. Because she doesn\u2019t care about that yet.

I cannot imagine them being able to fall asleep knowing I was going through a major surgery and wanted them  there, irrespective of how old I was. \n\nAt the very least, my parents would be feeling concern  and worry for me rather than going online and trying to get strangers to say that their daughter was being a brat or Beira unreasonable.

It's doesnt matter if the parents can help her for anything she just need the mental support that you will be there. What the daughter feels are totally valid you literally choose the vacation over her and tbh i would also do the same if my parents dont make the effort to be there for me when i need them the most. It not even like you dont have the money to flight back or it's the first day of your vacation. Also idk where ppl from but it's the norm in my country that parents stay with you during this time.

Brings me back to point 1 and 2. The baby could have died, their daughter could have died. Had it been baby or their child that died, would they still say \"oops sorry, vacation bought and paid for. It will be another week before we come back.\" \n\nIt wasn't impossible for them to not go on this trip so close to birth. It wasn't impossible for them to come home, in case the worst happened. They made these choices.\n\nThey have no right to complain about not seeing their grandchild. They should expect themselves to not be a priority since their daughter/grandchild wasn't a priority to them.", "I had an emergency c-section. No one was with me except my husband and we didn\u2019t call anyone until everything was over and didn\u2019t have anyone visit until we were at home for two weeks (by choice). I think it\u2019s sometimes main character syndrome, sometimes just the kind of relationship people have. But I can\u2019t relate.", "Yeah it needs to be. I thought it was everywhere then i came across western approach and boy! Maybe that's why the birth rate is declining. Also to add.  A massage lady came everyday for her. Her food was regulated to balance nutrition with taste. The baby's clothes and everything else was handled by the family. All SIL did was bond with the baby. Even when the newborn was cranky we all took turns walking them that's why we have such good bond with my nibblings. India has lot of good customs and traditions too but they are never mentioned.", "In Germany we have the so called \"Wochenbett\" (Week-bed) which I believe lasts 6-8 weeks. During that time, ideally, the mom should not do anything but sleep (when she can), feed the baby, rest and overall take care of herself.\n\nObviously nowadays this is rather difficult and there are plenty of individual variations of the Wochenbett. In my case for example, after my son was born, my husband took a month of vacations + a month of paid time off, and I had plenty of help for 8 weeks, which was ideal. By the time my Wochenbett was over I was fully recovered.", "My mom freaked out her lamaze class. The instructor knew this was her 3rd pregnancy, so she asked if she would demonstrate the techniques that she found most helpful in her first 2 births. My mom was around 35 weeks along. Her response was 'I don't know any, I had my first 2 before before my classes started.' \ud83d\ude05 As she tells it, the instructor spent most of the rest of the class reassuring the other soon to be moms that that's not usual and they should have plenty more time. \n\n\nI was very premature (8 weeks), and my parents weren't even allowed to touch me without disinfecting and wearing gloves for about 6 weeks. Months in the NICU. My next sibling was about 4 weeks early and also spent time in the NICU. (The lamaze class my mom had signed up for started the day after the birth. Oops) No visitors allowed for a couple months after getting home. My grandmother stayed with us when my youngest sibling was born, but that was mostly because my grandfather had died 2 weeks before the birth, and both her and my mom were having a hard time. It had nothing to do with the birth.\n\n\nThat's where having your family with you matters. OP's daughter is upset about this now, but in time, it will be one of the stories shared among the family. OP sounds like they were always planning to be there, they just weren't available for 2 weeks booked long in advance. I would hope that being willing to apologize and be supportive will overcome the anger on the daughter's part.", "I was 12, but same. Never changed a diaper though because I am a genius lol and have other siblings \ud83c\udf1a"]}
