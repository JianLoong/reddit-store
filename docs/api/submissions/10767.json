We were aware my daughter was soon to pop, but her due date wasn\u2019t until the end of this month, mind you these events took place in the beginning of this month. \n\nWe told him that was impossible, and just to follow their birthing plan and to keep us updated. A few hours later we got a call from my daughter updating us then asking when we\u2019d be on our way back and that she really wanted us to be here and that it was taken longer then expected, she was scared, etc. She\u2019s a first time mom so it was expected for her to be scared. My wife and I assured her everything would be fine, but we were unable to just pack up and go. She got upset and hung up on me.\n\nHours later in the middle of the night we missed a call due to us sleeping and it was her boyfriend saying there was complications and they were performing emergency c section. The next morning we called immediately and our daughter told us she was scared and things could\u2019ve went bad and our Cancun trip was more important to us then her, then hung up. We tried to call back but she wouldn\u2019t answer.\n\nThe baby was born healthy and our daughter is okay.

I think it sucks that you weren\u2019t calling to check in/slept through something major. It\u2019s so great that her and the baby are okay, but with an emergency surgery things could have gone a very different way. If my mom was away and couldn\u2019t get to me when I was in labor, she would be constantly calling/texting to make sure everything was going okay and she\u2019d make sure she could answer her phone in case there was an emergency. I would do the same for my babies.. maybe it\u2019s a family thing or a culture thing? But i do think she would\u2019ve felt more supported if you had at least checked in more/answered when there was an emergency. It\u2019s a tough situation all around.

That\u2019s the true issue, not that you were on vacation. This is an easy fix so try to be patient and understanding with her feelings. I had covid when delivering my child and was in labor for 18 hours before I had an emergency c section as well. My parents couldn\u2019t be at the hospital but they were in constant communication with us the entire time. They stayed up all night until the baby was born. It made me feel safe.

Also, a C section is always possible even if not planned.  Life happens and this time it turned out your daughter needed one.\n\nYour daughter & son in law are adults and while perhaps are disappointed that you could not be there for the birth, they  (particularly your daughter) needs to get off their selfish butts.   They are the ones entering the world of parenting.  You and your wife have already been there and done that job.  You had no obligation to be there for the birth and you have nothing to apologize for - so stop doing it! \n\nThe daughter needs to calm down.  She isn't the first person to give birth without her parents nearby.  If she continues to refuse to speak with you and your wife - fine. It is her loss.

It really changed the way I view their feelings about me. Unlike OP's daughter I've never told them that, but every time they ask me for something I think about how I could have died in that hospital and they didn't come to see me or support my husband while it was happening.", "How sad.", "Yeah I did. As a parent, I couldn\u2019t imagine missing the birth of my grandchild, even if it\u2019s just to support my child. But hey, that\u2019s just me. And then, their daughter called because she wanted their support, and all they said was that she would be fine. To top it off, they MISSED a call saying there was an emergency C-section due to complications. Did they come home then? They did show her the vacation was more important, and I wouldn\u2019t let them meet the baby either.", "I can understand not being able to rush back...but the part I don't understand is...why couldn't they at the very least keep their phones where they could hear it and wake up? I feel like that would've been a decent common ground even.", "Lmao there are drug dealers in the US too", "Fine. I accept that as true. You don\u2019t say to your kid \u201cwe aren\u2019t leaving our vacation because we care about it more than you\u201d and then turn your phone off and go to sleep. You *say* \u201cI\u2019ll be on the next plane\u201d and then you start working on your travel plan. Even if you don\u2019t get there any earlier, you reassure your kid and then you stay reachable.", "You can absolutely get on a flight to the US from Mexico at a moment's notice. TF are you talking about?\n\nNTA either way", "Yea, so selfish to expect your parents to answer the phone. Now they\u2019re selfish and alone. Hope they\u2019re happy.", "Yep. It\u2019s beyond anything I could ever imagine doing as a parent. Your child is in a life threatening situation and you just\u2026go to sleep\u2026because you\u2019re too tired from your beach day? Awful parents.", "It was on the desk next to my head", "I\u2019m flabbergasted. These people wouldn\u2019t be my kid\u2019s grandparents, they\u2019d be somebody that I used to know.", "Let me be clear that I agree with your take and am not trying to negate it. But I have a funny story for you.\n\nMy maternal grandmother came to stay with us just before my younger sibling was born to help out. She and I went to the hospital to pick up mom and the baby when they were ready. Mom had to fill out some discharge paperwork so she asked her mom to hold the newborn for a minute. \n\nMy grandma freaked. She and my grandpa had adopted all 5 of their children as toddlers. She'd never held a newborn. She was a big help taking care of me, though.", "Weird, I wouldn't even expect my mom there either. I just genuinely don't visualize it. That's cool tho, glad she was there for you and your husband lol", "No one said it's required. But they did know their daughter was scared and was already saying things weren't going well, so I just don't understand why they didn't stay at least reachable knowing their daughter wanted their comfort.   \n\n\nI'm soley asking to hear what they themselves say to understand. I like to hear all the info first before judging.", "Oh, so you think medical emergencies don't happen to grown, married women during birth? Or is it that you don't believe parents should care enough to even leave their phones handy?", "Jesus Christ. You must be a blast at parties", "She isnt married", "When you want your Mom, you want your Mom. \n\nWhen you want your Dad, you want your Dad.\n\nI personally would not have taken the trip if my daughter was pregnant, on the off chance that something happened and she needed me. But that\u2019s me.\n\nOver a million girls give birth every year without their parents being their support system. But for some Mai Tais in Mexico? I would have chose different.", "The point is thst it\u2019s the father\u2019s responsibility.", "Are you a parent?", "If this causes the kind of rupture in the relationship that would cause them never ever to see the grandchildren, there was something wrong with the relationship in the first place. People who love each other forgive each other.", "Just FYI the original post did not say that, that's an edit", "Yup.", "It was planned before they found out she was pregnant.\n\nThis does not change my judgment.", "You didn\u2019t keep your phones on for updates just in case something bad happened? My parents would, and they\u2019ve done it even though neither me nor my sister were pregnant.", "INFO: OP, did your daughter ever tell you that she wanted you there for the birth or ask you to cancel your holiday just in case? Also, was the trip non-refundable?", "Did you not get travel insurance on such an expensive trip? Surely you could have adjusted the dates if you\u2019d covered such an event.", "Sorry but they say \u201c we knew she was soon to pop\u201d\nMany many births occur early.  And many have complications", "Maybe read the story properly before commenting", "Yes i read the story.   Once they were away and their child needed them it was up to them to prioritize what they would do", "Thank you for clarifying.   But to me, being there to support your child is more important than finishing a vacation.  But you had every right to act as you did.", "You planned before yes, but you should have changed the plan. Your daughter was trying to express her need for you to be there", "Becoming a mother doesn\u2019t end your being someone\u2019s child. Giving birth is scary and it\u2019s understandable to want your mum, the woman who went through this with you, to be there. It doesn\u2019t matter that _people_ give birth all the time. People are not a hive mind. _She_ had never given birth before and wanted support. \n\nI agree that they should have talked about this before the trip: what if I go into labour while you\u2019re away. She should have communicated her wish and negotiated something.", "Are you her doctor? Why were you required at her birth?", "and you should have cancelled it once she was. this it was planned beforehand excuse you keep using does not hold up as well as you think it does. situations change, you adjust. You've shown your daughter how much you really care about her.", "Exactly ! I just don't get why they have so much expectations! \n\nI understand the daughter but then they have planned the trip way early and it was a circumstance that was beyond their control. Not the a-holes at all", "Why would you not want to be there to support your daughter during a very scary time? Do you realize that birth is still very risky? Alot of things can go wrong. She could have died. A c-section is terrifying. I don't care how old I get, I know my mother will always be there for me in the blink of an eye. I could not imagine being so callous.\n Sure, they aren't required to be there, but I could not imagine leaving my daughter to go through such a scary thing after being asked to come. I understand they still wouldn't have made it back in time, but showing up still would have meant the world to her. I wouldn't have even left so close to her due date. Early birth is very common. Due dates are speculation. They are based on the last period, which makes them able to fluctuate by up to FOUR weeks.", "I think your Y will be counted as judgement by the bot. You can put some $&@* in between.", "I agree but space out your verdict, at glance it appears you are voting OP the AH.", "Um. When your daughter is going through the most dangerous and traumatic event she possibly could, literally putting her life on the line, yes you should fucking ask her how she is and how she is feeling and what her concerns are.\n\nShe\u2019s your daughter for christsake. People do more for pregnant coworkers they barely know outside the office.", "Lmao how? This post is in regards to their daughters feelings. Why does the bf\u2019s parents location matter in regards to their daughter wanting her parents for support ???", "I\u2019m also a parent, and hopefully not a grandparent soon but I\u2019m sorry, this trip was planned WAY before they decided to have a baby and unless it was life or death, and both my boys were born via emergency c-section, I would not have cared if my parents were there or not, only cared that I was there.  That is just me and no judgement that you feel differently but, for me, I only cared about me, my baby and my child\u2019s mother.", "Wtf. Think about it a little harder. They weren\u2019t a couple hours away and couldnt just up and drive home and to the hospital. They were out of the country! Have to pack, change flights, chances are they won\u2019t be direct flights, so there\u2019s layovers and immigration and on top of that I doubt they would get a flight back that day! Most all flights are full nowadays. The c section happened that night. To sum up, Congrats you cancelled everything and spent a bunch of money to fly home and you\u2019re a day late and missed everything lol good job bro.", "We didn\u2019t turn our phone off, it was on, up all the way.

But alright, whatever", "I can get not being able to rush back, traveling back, depending how far, coulda taken longer then the birth...But the not answering phone thing...I don't know, I keep my phone on sound for my boyfriend who is 1000 miles away even if there isn't an emergancy or health thing just IN CASE. I couldn't imagine not even having a just in case.

I cant wrap my head around it.", "Thank you for making my dad with this hilariously awesome story!\n\nYou\u2019re right, not all parents have physically given birth! I have a cousin (single child) that was adopted. I don\u2019t know why this didn\u2019t even hit me.", "Lol I know right?

NTA", "Thank you for that because this whole time reading the comments I've been like why TF won't anyone read the whole post?? Lol!!\nSuper important detail.\n\nNTA for going on the vacation and not leaving, but YTA for how it was handled and just going to sleep peacefully without updates. I dropped my dogs off to get spayed and couldn't function at all, I can't imagine my grandchild being born and just taking a snooze expecting to hear the next day.

She i grown. There is a whole man who got her pregnant", "They did", "Maybe she could have expressed those wishes like 8 months ago?", "Hard disagree. What was he supposed to do, go into the room and direct the doctor on what to do? Her husband was there, that\u2019s the most important part.", "I literally didn\u2019t want my parents anywhere near the hospital when I gave birth. I love them dearly. But I didn\u2019t want anyone extra around to distract my care team or bother them with questions. I was terrified. High risk pregnancy and a high risk delivery. I needed everyone there paying attention to their job - not my mom or dad being excited outside.", "She had the responsibility to tell her parents that she would need them there *before* they left on a trip that was planned and paid for before she was even pregnant. She didn\u2019t. It was her responsibility to raise this issue beforehand. As you should very well know, she is in charge of her birthing plan. The plan cannot be, \u201cI never told you I expected you here, how dare you not be here.\u201d\n\nAnd I get that pregnancy is traumatic. But \u201cthe most dangerous and traumatic event of her life\u201d is demeaning to an enormous swath of people who go through violent, unplanned, unwanted, horrible trauma. Birthing is scary, but keep perspective.", "Completely fair. I know a lot of women who want at least their mother there for support. And I get that the trip was planned before, but for me he said he planned to be there for the birth, if that\u2019s the case, a lot of women deliver early, and it\u2019s clear she wanted them there. The big thing for me is that when she called asking them to come, all they said was \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine\u201d and then missed a call afterwards. It just seems like there was no effort from them, and that\u2019s what will affect their relationship with their child and grandchild", "How could you sleep? \n\nYou must have a very different relationship with your daughter than I have with my kids or my parents. And I don\u2019t mean that in a good way. \n\nYou had a choice between your daughter and your vacation. You chose vacation. Now deal with the consequences of that choice.", "Damn, what did your daughter do to be dismissed so easily?! She was having complications during the birth of your grandkid and you're sleeping through it, literally?!", "Labor several weeks early with an emergency c section isn\u2019t what anyone plans on.\n\nAnd just because you know what\u2019s coming doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be scared and need support. Having a major medical event and coming out the other side with a tiny helpless creature that can\u2019t survive without you is a hell of a lot to deal with.", "She ended up having an emergency c section which implies there were serious complications that could\u2019ve risked her or the babies lives. Yea had she had an uncomplicated vaginal birth it would still suck but She went through a traumatic and grave complication that required an emergency c section which I would think might make you want family around.", "Because some people still care about their kids even when they\u2019re married adults?", "What??   She reached out to her parents.   They chose to stay on vacay.    Fine.  But it may well have altered their relationship with their daughter", "Since they say they were planning to be there for the birth, it sounds like she probably did tell them she wanted them there.", "Maybe she shouldn't have to.", "Kids needs and wants don\u2019t always line up with what\u2019s convenient but you be there for than anyway.

Some girls want their mother, especially if there is complications. I think it's important to hear the mothers especially either way though. If they say no, then don't show up.

Maybe figuring something out, even if it's a compromise because you can't go such as facetime or being on the phone with the partner.   \n\n\nIt's definitely different for everyone  \n\n\nI'm still not even sure what judgement I wanna give cause I see both sides, but reading your comment has helped with some of the view! <3", "Yeah and that's fine but it very much sounds like their daughter wanted them there. I dont know if they talked about it before, but I just can't get over going to sleep after hearing your daughter had complications to the point she needed emergency surgery.
