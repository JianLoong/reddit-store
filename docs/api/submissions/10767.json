My wife and I assured her everything would be fine, but we were unable to just pack up and go. She got upset and hung up on me.\n\nHours later in the middle of the night we missed a call due to us sleeping and it was her boyfriend saying there was complications and they were performing emergency c section.

I think it sucks that you weren\u2019t calling to check in/slept through something major. It\u2019s so great that her and the baby are okay, but with an emergency surgery things could have gone a very different way. If my mom was away and couldn\u2019t get to me when I was in labor, she would be constantly calling/texting to make sure everything was going okay and she\u2019d make sure she could answer her phone in case there was an emergency.

That\u2019s the true issue, not that you were on vacation. This is an easy fix so try to be patient and understanding with her feelings. I had covid when delivering my child and was in labor for 18 hours before I had an emergency c section as well. My parents couldn\u2019t be at the hospital but they were in constant communication with us the entire time. They stayed up all night until the baby was born. It made me feel safe.

Also, a C section is always possible even if not planned.  Life happens and this time it turned out your daughter needed one.\n\nYour daughter & son in law are adults and while perhaps are disappointed that you could not be there for the birth, they  (particularly your daughter) needs to get off their selfish butts.   They are the ones entering the world of parenting.  You and your wife have already been there and done that job.  You had no obligation to be there for the birth and you have nothing to apologize for - so stop doing it! \n\nThe daughter needs to calm down.  She isn't the first person to give birth without her parents nearby.  If she continues to refuse to speak with you and your wife - fine. It is her loss.

I personally believe that your parent will always be your parent and you\u2019ll always need them in some capacity, it\u2019s not wrong of her to want her parents when she\u2019s terrified and facing childbirth, and it sounds like she clutched to the familiar-the birth plan and she wanted her mum.", "No one\u2019s saying they should never go on vacation but when you find out your family is having a medical emergency choosing to stay and drink at the beach is an ah move.", "Easy.

I doubt the daughter would have wanted to pay the extra last minute fees for their emergency flight", "Jumping on my own comment to point a few other things out. This baby was born premature with a difficult birth. It's very fragile health-wise and has nearly no immune system developed yet. \n\nOP and his wife had spent a week in a tourist town in a foreign country and would have taken a crowded plane there and back. Either one of those facts mean that even if they had dropped everything, it would not have been safe to see mother or baby for several days at the very least. It's peak cold/flu/covid season. I wouldn't let them near a medically fragile newborn for a few weeks.\n\nETA: I keep thinking of other points. The daughter was recovering from fairly serious abdominal surgery. She shouldn't have been exposed to any potential illnesses either.\n\nETA2: The Mayo Clinic and CDC both state that any birth before the start of week 37 is considered premature. Without knowing the exact timing here, I called the baby a premie because they could be right on that border. But even if the baby is only preterm rather than premature, they are still a newborn with an as yet underdeveloped immune system.", "Your grandma rocks, that's the best kind of funny, the 'kind' kind :)", "I am from the US also.

We had two attending midwives, one for me one for my son). My sister was there mostly to help my oldest if he woke up, but basically it was all hands on deck at push time, as I was essentially floating and had someone one each limb pushing back against me haha. \n\nAnyways, we are indigenous and matriarchal culturally. It\u2019s very common for female family to be involved in each others births.

A lot of people wouldn\u2019t want their parents at the hospital while they give birth, c-section or no c-section.

I find that odd and a little cold? \n\nI'm saying that as someone who would not want my parents in the delivery room. Yes, you couldn't have physically done anything. Neither will your daughter be able to physically do anything when you're ill. You'll still want her there. Emotional support can be far more important than anything else. I'm not saying her expectations are reasonable. I'm not saying you didn't check in. But you didn't mention it, and I'm guessing it's because you didn't. Can you see how someone who is scared and very hormonal who had planned on you being there might feel like they weren't your priority?

When I had my first baby, my dad was on vacation in Germany.   He flew home that night and visited me the next day. Despite being tired and jet-lagged.  I can't imagine how discarded I would have felt if he said \"sorry, paid a lot for this,  you're not as important as my vacation \" and then didn't show up until a week later.   She has every right to feel let down by you,  because you let her down.

Not in the room, but just to know she was there, even if phone calls during labor and after baby was delivered. \n\nI can see why she\u2019s upset. She had a TRAUMATIC birth experience.

Second/third question: have you had a parent pass away, and if so, did you feel a pain like a small child who had lost the only place where they felt the certainty of safety?\nYou may be thinking these questions are awfully dramatic, and maybe so: I don\u2019t know all the details of your daughter\u2019s medical situation. But when I think emergency c-section, I\u2019m thinking \u2018risk to the life of mom/child\u2019 and that\u2019s before we get into how deplorable our maternal health statistics are as a country. And that\u2019s on top of hours of contractions, and her first time experiencing birth, which would\u2019ve been quite possibly the most painful experience of her life to date. We know that extreme pain and fear can make people revert into a childlike state, a la dying soldiers crying out for their mothers. When your psyche is pushed too hard, you crave that feeling of security, if you had it as a child. And I feel like that\u2019s the source of the ongoing coldness your daughter is showing.\nYou\u2019re arguing your absence based on money lost, not being on time anyway, and no medical value to your presence. I think she saw the value of your presence as psychological certainty, a placebo effect sure, but an incredibly powerful one that could reassure her on that deep childlike level that she and her new baby were going to be ok. A partner is excellent, but they can\u2019t replicate that in most cases. And you weren\u2019t there.\nAnd now, she\u2019s going through new motherhood and experiencing all those hormonal feelings of wanting to move mountains for that baby, just to make sure they\u2019re safe and happy. And she\u2019s having to reconcile that with how her own inner child was let down by her parents. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your absence that would sting the most, if it were me; it\u2019s your failure to try. Maybe the airline wouldn\u2019t have switched your tickets if you\u2019d called, and maybe you absolutely couldn\u2019t afford new ones, and maybe you would\u2019ve been too late, and maybe you would\u2019ve just been voices on the phone next to her late that night while the doctors did what they could. But you would\u2019ve tried, and the adult part of her could understand the failure to move mountains. But you didn\u2019t try. And I understand why she wouldn\u2019t want to see or talk to you right now. Bc if I were her, and I interacted with you now, all I could think of would be loss of certainty.", "NTA - you asked if you were the ahole for not immediately heading back. So no. But you are absolutely the ahole if you think there is nothing you and your wife could have provided that the dr can\u2019t. I take that back, maybe not an hole, maybe just really ignorant of the emotional support and reassurance that your presence would have provided. Which is actually sad. She judt had the scariest experience of her life, and a normal birth is said to be the closest to death an average woman will get. And hers did not go smoothly or normally. They don\u2019t do emergency c sections unless the life of the mother and/or the child is in IMMEDIATE risk. So her being upset and scared is normal. Whether it was reasonable of her or not to expect you to be there, at that moment she was a scared person who wanted her parents\u2019 reassurance and it wasn\u2019t there. It is possible that once she recovers fully and the child is ok and not at risk of immune threats she will be able to understand your side and will let you see the kid. But unless you show you actually understand and accept her feelings about her experience, your apologies are probably not going to be believed. I hope you can all work it out, but take the first step and accept her experiences and feelings in the moment and stop only looking at the end result. Because she doesn\u2019t care about that yet.

In those moments, hours are an eternity.\n\nSo I\u2019ll say YTA. Not for travel, not for being unwilling to cancel your vacation, but for missing the call overnight. Throwing your vacation plans off for 12 hours, to be available for someone you love - who is mid-medical-emergency with the life of her child in play, and who has actively reached out to you as the person her panic needs - is not a lot to ask.

Once again i'm surprised by the comment section. Cant believe ppl said the daughter overreact. In my country there is a saying giving birth is when you in border of birth and death. And ik that's a exaggeration but the point is giving birth can be dangerous. The daughter was literally scared and ask for her parents. It's doesnt matter if the parents can help her for anything she just need the mental support that you will be there. What the daughter feels are totally valid you literally choose the vacation over her and tbh i would also do the same if my parents dont make the effort to be there for me when i need them the most. It not even like you dont have the money to flight back or it's the first day of your vacation. Also idk where ppl from but it's the norm in my country that parents stay with you during this time.

If for some reason I was dumb enough to actually go on this trip (knowing I would be around tons of people on the flight/trip, etc), I would know I can't see my grandchild for a few weeks after birth due to the chances of passing on a contagion. I would then not go through with said trip but whatever.\n\n3. If I ended up stranded on this trip, I would be regularly checking in with my child (staying up all night with them if they wanted my company via phone), letting them know I am there for them, letting them vent to me as they needed.\n\n4.

It ended up being an amazing experience; my MIL made sure everyone was looked after and made tea all night and my FIL slept through the whole thing (I was pretty quiet throughout lol). There was a funny moment when the trainee midwife who was there with the actual midwife went into the spare room to get some towels, came back in the room and exclaimed quite bewildered 'there's a man sleeping in that room!'.\n\nAnyhow, just sharing this because babies come when babies come and in my opinion NTA for OP.

They basically allowed the child to get used to being away from their parents and home to make the transition to daycare easy by slowly increasing the amount of time the child was at the day care.   I think it took at least a week before the child was expected to stay at the day care all day without mom, and even then, if the child wasn\u2019t comfortable with it, they extended the time for mom to accompany the child.

Eventually the kid will be there alone for a few hours, half a day and then for the full day. that process can last several weeks. expect a minimum of two weeks.\n\nin Germany a lot of kids start daycare at around 1 or 2 years of age.

After the fifth week he was doing full time already. We had zero issues.\n\nIs deffinitely a more gentle way to introduce the child to a new environment. It also helps that moms here have a whole year of maternity leave. We started Kindergarten when my son had just turned 1 and I was about to start working again.

That would fundamentally change our relationship, no matter how bad they said they felt later or apologized.", "Good to know in advance he will be useless if your child has an emergency, I guess?", "This cultural tradition is the one I most wish would catch on in the States. When I had my oldest I was living 8 hours from the closest family member and my husband had only 2 weeks off to help me. My blood pressure wouldn't come down so I wasted a week of that sitting in the hospital where I had tons of help from the nurses but when I got home it was like 5 days of him there to help and then I was on my own. Thankfully my grandmother (who basically raised me) was retired by then and she came to stay with me for a whole month. It was amazing. She did all of the things that you actually want someone to do for you when you have a new baby. She made meals, she cleaned, she ran errands. She took the baby so I could nap. I had my son a few weeks before Thanksgiving and she cooked us a whole meal since we weren't able to travel home for the holidays like normal. It was just the best experience I could have asked for. Everyone should get that kind of support to help them transition to their new normal.", "It really is a privilege, one I have apparently taken for granted reading these comments. And that support and bond carry\u2019s on a lifetime. My aunties are like mothers to me, and they love my kids and have invested time and love into them too. Grateful \u2764\ufe0f", "Ya it could be moved. Put in some amount of effort to show that you care about this moment in your daughters life. It\u2019s very simple. Just have the conversation with her before that. OPs response is the opposite of supportive, and they put in almost no effort to PREVENT This possibility. That\u2019s why they\u2019re in this mess.", "Sometimes for free. Sometimes it's more expensive.\n\nTravel insurance will often pay the difference, but there can be a deductable/excess charge, and would usually only do it for bereavement due to death or serious illness in the family. Daughter's pregnancy due date is unlikely to be covered.\n\nAnd the due date was supposed to be a month after the vacation according to OP, so it's not a massive clash considering the potential expense of changing the dates.", "Okay, your husband would miss it, but would *you*? I doubt that both members of a couple go into a coma when they sleep. And who could even sleep deeply under these circumstances?? I'd be awake all night, checking my phone, worrying.", "My mum keeps her phone on full volume now that I live alone. I get very very sick from common colds (lots of sinus/allergy issues) and she checked in on me to make sure I could still breath at night when I get a cold. This is just bizarre how apparently when their child is an adult, they can just be nonchalant about them.", "That\u2019s still soooo early honestly though. I think the daughter gets a little bit of pass for this immediate newborn period or at least for the first couple weeks. First couple weeks with the first baby are so hard that it\u2019s really more survival than thinking about things like that. It\u2019s more is it gonna hurt when I use the bathroom/incision care/learning to change diapers, feed burp and put to sleep YOUR baby because they aren\u2019t always the same, breastfeeding boobs out all the time because newborns eat constantly. That first little bit is sooo hard that I think it should be taken into account when considering why she hasn\u2019t yet been able to see it from someone else\u2019s perspective. Not saying her actions are right, but just that this is kinda one of those shitty situations where feelings will be hurt almost certainly somewhere because of the situation more than the people involved, and sometimes especially when you\u2019ve just given birth you need some time to deal with those hurt feelings before understanding that your perspective isn\u2019t the only one.", "i had never held a baby until i had my own and it took my husband and i a couple of months to not be terrified. I literally hated changing her clothes because i was scared i would break her. 4 months in and she fights clothes so now i go to war everytime HAHAHA", "I agree with everything you said. I'm hoping once the new mom has a chance to breathe, she might see things differently. A week or so really isn't that long when she's focused on the new baby.", "YTA for not even trying. Your daughter was scared. I know plenty of first time birthers that wanted their parents there because it\u2019s scary. You could have stayed on the phone with your daughter, or FaceTimed/Google Meeted her. You could have looked to see if there were any flights out that you could have taken. I\u2019m sure the lack of effort hurt her more than y\u2019all not being there. Being a parent doesn\u2019t end when they grow up. It\u2019s a lifelong commitment.", "YTA.  Yeah, I'd have ended my vacation early. This was a once in a lifetime event, and your kid wanted the support of her parents. You chose the vacation over her, and she's always going to remember that, and you are going to have to deal with the repercussions of that choice.\n\nKids are a lifetime responsibility, and they are very very good at stopping their parents from doing things their parents want to enjoy. It just is how it is. When your kids need you, you jump, at least you do if you're a good parent. Even if you know there's little you could do, just the knowledge that you are there and you give a shit means everything. \n\nBut you weren't there. You didn't even try to be there. You didn't even bother to call or videochat when you should and could have. She will never forget that. You done fcked up.", "It's really easy to see who never gave birth here in the comments. \n\nYTA, who goes on vacation in the weeks to their daughter's labour? There was no way to reschedule? \n\nI hope your daughter will be a better parent than her parents are", "It doesn't make you an asshole, but I will say, a grown child reaching out to their parent when scared means that you had an amazing relationship with your daughter. Likely, she reached out while you were in Mexico understanding the very points you mentioned (that you would waste a lot of money, couldn't help, etc.), but reached out anyway because of how dependable and supportive you have been and how scared she was. Your decision to prioritize a vacation over your daughter's most scary moment for her will likely change your relationship from this point onward. \n\nIt's a no win situation. It doesn't make you an asshole, but there is nothing you can say or do from this point onward for your relationship to revert back to that relationship. And multiple bombardments of apologies just isn't going to change that. It was an important moment, and it wasn't reasonable for her to expect you to be there, but she asked and you denied being there for her.", "I personally think people have less stamina now, maybe we don't need it as much. My issue with you, is they kept calling, asking for help from their family. You guys refused to help them. Isn't that the whole purpose of family to be there with each other? My initial comment was made as my husband sat in the hospital room while I had a C-section performed on me. I had the person I wanted with me. I was alot older than your daughter probably is, so he was all I wanted. So in this instance, YTA.", "Going with YTA if you knew she needed your support for the birth. Parenting doesn\u2019t stop at 18.", "I don't think anyone is ta here, but I would be so upset if my mom wasn't there for me when giving birth. I dunno. They're allowed to be upset, but also I hope they realize there wasn't anything anybody could do besides cancel the trip and that didn't need to happen. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Oh boy. \n\nYTA. X1000. You booked a trip. Okay. You saved money. That's good. Your daughter is PREGNANT and it is POSSIBLE she might be in labor during your trip?\n\nHMM- time to get TRAVEL INSURANCE or cancel while you still can. \n\nYour daughter could've DIED on an operating table but YoU CaN't LeAvE Cancun!?!\n\nShe called you. She was scared. That's your daughter. You'll be lucky if she ever speaks to you again, let alone let's you see her child.", "YTA\n\nIt doesn't matter if your trip was booked before she found out she was pregnant. There are options for rearranging things. Even if you didn't want to do that, you wouldn't be TA if you had actually made sure she could reach you.\n\nYour child was literally in a life and death situation and you didn't give enough of a fuck to be reachable. That is the real issue here. She feels abandoned because she was. This is even worse if there were plans for you to be there (despite the trip being totally within the range of normal pregnancy).\n\nAssuring her it would be fine is one of the worst things you can do. Clearly it wasn't fine. Yes the kid and she are alive, but c sections are major surgery and she may never be the same or have complications. You should assure her that its great she made it to the hospital so they can care for her but never say its going to be fine. You can't know that and she'd be even more devastated if something happened like the baby dying. \n\nI'm not sure why you are surprised your daughter won't let you see her. You didn't act like family. Why do you expect the benefits of family when there is no effort on your part? Maybe she wants to teach her kid to value family and figures you will be a bad influence.\n\nHaving people visit or taking a baby to visit are effort on the part of the parents. Why would they go out of there way to do something for people who were not invested or concerned about her health outcome?", "NAH. You weren\u2019t wrong, in every objective sense. But your daughter was scared and wanted her parents, and from her POV you didn\u2019t even try. If you want to fix this, you\u2019ll need to apologize profusely. She needs to see remorse from you to let this go, if she ever does. Expect to hear about this for years to come. Is she unreasonable? Maybe. Does that change how she feels? Not at all. And you cannot use reason on this one. You can\u2019t show her this thread and change her mind. Her parents didn\u2019t move Heaven and earth to get to her when she and her baby were in danger. To strangers, you aren\u2019t TA. But to her\u2026", "My parents were both present at my first born\u2019s birth. My mom held my leg and was instrumental with calming me down. She was so comforting to me whereas my husband was just kind of in shock. All her births were c-sections and she felt she missed out on the birth experience. My dad talks when he\u2019s nervous\u2026. So he was in the bathroom directly behind me chattering to him self when I was in the pushing stage. I didn\u2019t really want him to see my vagina anyway so I appreciated him being there that way. His anxious rattling in the background also gave me comfort. He\u2019s not good in a stressful situation so hearing him babbling cracked me up. \n\nMy family is British, but I\u2019m from the US which is where I gave birth. Im sure it\u2019s not the norm but I\u2019m very close with my parents and I wanted them there. If I could have also had all my sisters I\u2019d have been happy with that too. We are a tight knit bunch", "It\u2019s not her grandparents, it\u2019s her parents. OP is the newborn baby\u2019s grandfather \n\nI\u2019m going with NAH here\u2026 because I understand the predicament that prevented them from returning on time but I don\u2019t fault the daughter for wanting mom and dad to support her in her most vulnerable and scary moment.", "What you\u2019re missing is she wasn\u2019t calling for a witness, she was calling because she was their child in a hospital and she was scared.", "100% Agree, NAH.  \n\nYou couldn't have done anything but be in the vicinity for support.  You probably couldn't have actually even seen her.  People have babies every few seconds. It's a thing.  I can see not canceling a big lifetime trip because, rationally, you can't do anything even if you do immediately fly home. And there's a 99% chance, everythings going to be fine in the end and you'll come home to a new family member.  \n\nYour daughter has every right to be mad.  You DID choose your vacation over supporting her.  Perhaps she is irrational in the amount of support she expected.  However, she made it clear that she expected you to drop everything and come support her.  Again, not saying that's OK, but that's what she wanted.  You chose to stay on vacation instead.  So yeah, you chose your vacation over her as far as she is concerned.  She has every right to set a boundary that she feels is correct.  Her boundary is being low or no contact with you right now.  That's her right.  \n\nYou were in no way obligated to leave your vacation.  She is in no way obligated to keep in touch.  These are facts, even if y'all wanna downvote me.  People do what they want, even if we disagree with their reasoning or think it's irrational.  We have to respect their decisions. \n\nI do think you were an AH for not being more concerned.  She was scared and she wanted her parents.  You couldn't be there in person, but you could have been there virtually.  You could have FaceTimed for hours.  Or checked in every hour.  Having a good sleep where you missed an emergency call about her situation was an AH move.  \n\nYou should have made expectations clear.  Perhaps thrown in a joke about hoping to come home to a new baby!  (I know it was early, but that last month is iffy).  Then she could have joked back that she'd expect you to be there.  \n\nAs far as she is concerned, she made it clear she wanted you home.  You chose not to do that.  She had an unfortunate difficult situation and required emergency surgery where (again, as far as she's concerned) she could have died or her baby could have died or both.  You couldn't even be bothered to answer your phone.  So yeah, as far as she's concerned you chose your vacation over supporting her in the way she made clear she wanted to be supported.  So she's mad.  And that's allowed.  Her feelings are her feelings.  \n\nI personally, wouldn't have expected my mom to leave a trip to come to me if I was in the hospital. But that's ME.  Your daughter had different opinions.  And yes, just knowing that you were on your way would have brought her some comfort.  Is it a rational thing to expect? Up to each individual to decide. \n\nI know that I recently went through a very difficult situation.  I did not ask my husband to be there for me because I thought that would have been silly and a waste of his time. He had to work.  We both did, no point in us BOTH missing three days of work.  He ended up being required to be there for part of it.  Even though he couldn't be in the room, knowing that he was outside in the hall brought me extreme comfort. And yes, expectations of a husband and a parent are drastically different, I'm just using it as an example of how I was comforted by someone being near, even though they couldn't be with me.  \n\nAgain, I vote no assholes here  NAH for not jumping on a plane to head home.", "Also, it sucks that OP and wife apparently didn't discuss with the daughter beforehand what to expect if she were to give birth during their vacation. It should not have been a surprise to the daughter that the parents weren't willing to come back; those expectations should have been set in advance. Daughter still may not have been happy with it, but she would have at least known that that's what would happen.", "THIS SO MUCH. I have the feeling many people here forget that it is not only about providing active help, but rather providing support and love for their OWN child in need. Nobody expects grandma and grandpa to dive in the surgery room and perform the c-section themselves, but the important part is knowing your mom and dad is there for you in such a scary situation. \n\nSo NTA for not going back immediately, because yes, moving all the way back from a different country doesn\u2019t really make sense. But you should at least show your child you care and are there for them. Ok, so you did not want to stay all night up, I (somehow) get it, but at least pick up the phone when you know your daughter is in labour. This is the bare minimum I\u2019d expect myself, tbh. \n\nAlso, I really hope they just didn\u2019t hear the phone and it was not on silent. In the latter case I\u2019ll start switching towards YTA.", "Agreed. My mom wasn\u2019t able to make it when I gave birth, but she stayed on the phone with me for 12 hours. As soon as I got scared and said \u201cI want my mom\u201d my (now ex) husband called her and told her I was scared. She never hung up and she was saying all the right things. \n\nI can\u2019t decide if OP is an AH but they definitely could have done better.", "I\u2019d hazard a guess given the behaviour they\u2019ve always been emotionally unavailable, and the daughter hoped baby would change that.  OP sounds so like my father.", "This. If it was agreed they\u2019d be at the birth, they should have cleared the whole month before her due date just in case. They had several months notice to change reservations/flights. Even if there were fees to do so, you\u2019d think their daughter\u2019s well being would be worth it. I\u2019m also surprised, given the proximity of the trip to the due date, they didn\u2019t at least have a conversation about this possibility. OBs usually tell you to be prepared anytime between 37&42 weeks. And as others have mentioned, they also should have planned on a bumper quarantine period after international travel. Planes are germ central!", "Yes! I do not understand all the NTA. \n\nWhy tf don\u2019t you want to be there for your daughter?! (And grand child) is beyond me.", "Yup. My parents are on the other side of the world and literally get up if I call for an emergency. If I\u2019m scared walking alone late at night, if I\u2019m sick and have to go to hospital, really it could be anything. If I have an important thing for uni/a job they will constantly be checking in\u2026so the fact that her parents slept through her labour boggles my mind.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect my parents to cut their vacation short (though I bet they would offer/would reschedule as soon as I got pregnant), but they would be on the phone 24/7. Maybe it\u2019s culture idk but I\u2019m on their mind in even day-to-day life, let alone in emergencies. I try not to call when it\u2019s night for them unless I have to, but they\u2019re always there.", "THANK YOU! These all these n t a and n a h judgements seem to be taking this person at face value, and missing some critical details\u2026\n\nMost critically, that this took place \u201cat the beginning of the month\u201d and the due date was \u201cat the end of the month\u201d\u2026 this means the baby came anywhere from 1-4 weeks early, likely closer to 2-3. Do people think due dates are set in stone? A couple weeks before the due date is super common, even likely. Sure, they booked before she announced her pregnancy\u2026 but all I\u2019m hearing is that they had several months to try to change this trip so they would be home during the month long window the baby was most likely to come, and they didn\u2019t bother. \n\nThere\u2019s a story in my family about how my grandparents would head to Florida on the day after Boxing Day for 4-6 weeks. They delayed their trip for 3 whole weeks so they could be there for my birth. Now I know its a bit easier in this scenario, but still. OP had months to try to change things around so this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Then, when it was, threw up their hands and said welp we paid for this so *shrug*. And didn\u2019t even make sure they were always available by phone at the very least. And all these people saying oh they wouldn\u2019t make it in time, oh it would have been so expensive, blah blah\u2026 did they even look? Doesn\u2019t sound like they had any intention to cut their vacation short, so these arguments are pointless bc they weren\u2019t the real barrier. They didn\u2019t want to leave.\n\nSo ya, YTA. Not because you didn\u2019t drop anything and go home. Bc you didn\u2019t even consider moving your trip to begin with, didn\u2019t even consider that an option when this happened, and didn\u2019t even offer the bare minimum that you could have offered without going home. Your daughter knows she can\u2019t count on you to be there in crisis, or in the most important moments of her life (whether in person, or at the very least be as present and engaged as possible from afar). And something tells me this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s learned this lesson. Get used to the consequences.", "I\u2019ve been looking for this comment. NTA in general but for that in particular, YTA. It isn\u2019t hard to leave your ringer on loudly or honestly have one person stay awake knowing your daughter is in active labor", "I agree with this! I wouldn't necessarily expect my parents to fly home but I would expect them to be up all night with me and take my damn call regardless of what time it was. YTA for that for sure!", "Thank you for another person that actually likes their children. \n\nJust because she\u2019s an adult doesn\u2019t make her stop being your baby. If your baby calls you crying in fear because of her major medical event and then emergency surgery you would just hang up and go to sleep? I don\u2019t understand why so many people in these comments don\u2019t like their kids. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even plan a trip in the last trimester of my Daughter or In-Laws birth event because ANYTHING can go wrong (or right!) and if they want me there then there would be no way I wouldn\u2019t be.\n\n(I especially keep having the terrible thought that what if the next call they finally made informed them one of them died?)", "My mom would have rescheduled the trip for after baby.

Or did they say we\u2019ll be there no problem, our vacation should be fine bc it\u2019s early? Was there a contingency plan if they couldn\u2019t be there? Did daughter say she couldn\u2019t care less if they were there? Did they communicate at all or did everyone just make up their own expectations?

I just can\u2019t imagine hearing her say on the phone that she\u2019s scared and needed me and prioritizing a vacation over it. If they couldn\u2019t afford to go back, it\u2019s different.

I love my mother but she's very high strung, my sister is practical as all heck and has given birth 3 times before.  She's also my power of attorney if something goes wrong. This is our first so I know my partner's super excited and it's natural he's really focusing on the baby but I also want someone there who's going to be focused on me. And we've already talked about if the baby does have to go to NICU he's going to go with the baby and she'll stay with me in recovery. Now if something happens and she can't make it to delivery, then I'll be mildly panicked.

However, I'm also going to add that it was really poor planning on OP to be away when they knew the baby was due this month. Due dates change and complications happen, especially first-time mothers who have no idea what to expect. The context seems like they were expecting the parents to be available for her as she was scared. The respectful thing to do would have been to plan the vacation a month later after the baby was due to account for any problems. The other thing to consider is with complications. What if things were bad and the baby was still born, and they weren't there? Also OP slept through their daughter first birth KNOWING there were complications. At the very least, what they could have done was stay up, face times, or answered the phone. That to me, sort of shows me OPs priorities and why their daughter is upset with them.\n\nSo I'm going to have to say neither the daughter or the parents are assholes and they just need to communicate better, and what OP did not answering the phone was selfish and inconsiderate. Also for the vast majority of redditors who have never had children or have been in this situation mocking the daughter, calling her an asshole and selfish...I just want to remind you that postpartum conditions do exist including anxiety and depression and can take months to get better with medication. It's a stressful and difficult time for a mother.\n\nWhen our first child was born, my wife had severe postpartum anxiety, and she was a wreck. My mother wasn't nice to her about it and was selfish as to why she couldn't always see or hold the baby because my wife was a paranoid mess. My mom didn't respect that, and it really hurt their relationship. So maybe be easy on judging the daughter here", "I can\u2019t believe people are ignoring the part of sleeping through it and not answering calls!

Like, if I called my parents and told them how scared I was feeling and they just brushed it off with a \"You're tough, you'll be fine!\" I'd be so heartbroken. I really would feel like they were prioritizing their vacation time over my well-being, and pregnancy hormones would not help with that. Especially when they couldn't even bother answering the phone when I'd be going into emergency surgery.", "If we have a family dinner, my mother won't go to sleep until my brother sends her a text that he got home safely, even though he's 30 and only lives 25 minutes away.", "I don\u2019t get the whole \u201cit would be a waste of money\u201d argument - the money is already spent regardless. I cannot imagine wanting to lie on the beach for a week knowing my traumatised child is recovering from major surgery while caring for a newborn, and my newborn grandchild is not where I am. I understand it when parents live a long way away and can\u2019t get there, can\u2019t get leave etc but his daughter is absolutely right - the holiday is more important to them, which must feel shit. \n\nI also cannot imagine how it feels for your partner to call your parents in the middle of the night to say you need an emergency caesarean after a long labour, and they just don\u2019t answer. They knew she was in labour and it was taking a long time and they just went to bed and didn\u2019t even turn up their phones?", "This is where I'm at too. I don't even think the baby was THAT early,  if I understood OP correctly,  trip was beginning of the month for 2 weeks,  & baby was due end of the month,  they should've expected some overlap in this instance. \n\nIt should've been discussed the second they found out the dates would be so close to each other.", "After reading some of these comments, it feels good to read about how much support you have.", "Yup, between doctor\u2019s appointments for a three month old and a child with developmental delays  I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have been asked about COVID symptoms, out of State/Country travel in the last two weeks and if anyone has had a fever, cough or flu like symptoms in the last ten days.\n\nNot sure what happens if you answer yes to the out of State/Country travel as every time I had been asked that it had been more than two weeks since the out of State travel.", "I would go with the \"being on two planes and in a tourist area made us unsafe to come home and see you right away, even if we had hopped a flight that day, the safest thing for you and baby would've been to quarantine, before visiting.\" \n\nSweet angel didn't plan her early arrival, and trip was planned with you gius back in time to be there. Sometimes things just don't happen according to plan.", "It\u2019s not reasonable to expect your parents to drop a holiday, buy last minute tickets, and fly back because you had sex and got pregnant.  Birth is not a family emergency.", "C-sections are usually different I think, there can't be a bunch of people because it's an actual surgery.", "How did you reach that conclusion? They said they missed a call due to being asleep and that they called back as soon as they woke up. Meaning they could have slept through a ring tone, and clearly they *were* checking their phones.", "Oh god I'm sorry you ended up being admitted but this made me laugh so hard!!", "To be fair. It all turned out alright in the end and I now have a happy healthy 6 year old so I couldn't give a monkeys about it. I find the whole experience really funny now.", "My mom is the biggest source of comfort in my life. I definitely want her there holding my hand when I give birth and I\u2019m in the most pain I\u2019ve ever experienced, but I\u2019d understand if it isn\u2019t possible.", "They didn't. They paid for a steeply discounted trip a year out. \n\nDaughter got pregnant *after* they paid for everything. And speaking from my experience of booking a trip every year, a  year in advance, I can get refunds. But that refund starts dropping 9 months out, and gets smaller over time.", "What is the purpose? \"Your parents can't come in and see you or the baby, but you'll be glad to know that they're sitting in their car in the parking lot!\"", "Then what? Because again, they probably wouldn't have even been let inside the building. My cousin gave birth in November and had to decide whether her husband or mom was going to be there with her because she couldn't have both. My mom is going in for a hysterectomy in two weeks and my stepdad isn't even allowed past reception.", "Thanks for using your whole brain to realize that they were bringing germs to the baby no matter what. These replies are so selfish.\n\nI'm so glad I have my parents - they wouldn't have even questioned whether to change the vacation date, they just would have done it to be with me.", "Especially if they had just traveled from another country!  They wouldn't be getting anywhere near the maternity ward.", "They wouldn't be able to be there with her anyway? If someone had heard they were coming in from a different country, they wouldn't be allowed anywhere near the NICU. Yes, while it was a crisis with an emergency C-Section, they nurses and doctors wouldn't risk a newborn being exposed to anything and everything.", "She is an adult and having one\u2019s parents in a crisis is a privilege, when possible, and certainly not an expectation one should have. She needs to grow up. She\u2019s just had a child of her own and still acts like a child!", "My mom got a phone call when labor started, and another one after it was over.  *Then* she got on a plane and came to help out.  She had already bought the ticket for a week later, so she only had to pay a small fee for changing it.\n\nMy stepdaughter absolutely did not want her mother with her.  She wouldn't have minded if I was there, but she didn't expect it.", "I didn\u2019t get that impression from OP. He speaks factually. They talked to their daughter over the phone with reassurances, when she called, and while we don\u2019t know for how long they spoke, we are at least aware that they did, and that they were trying to comfort her as best as they could while being in a different country.", "I mean they were completely out of reach sound asleep in their hotel accommodations anyway, to me that\u2019s a BIG part of the problem. They just kinda seem to be hands off, disconnected, parents that don\u2019t care all that much. As if them being in touch wasn\u2019t bad enough, they literally slept through a call knowing she was in labor. Being that it was an emergency C, that call literally could have easily been about the loss of their kid and or grandchild. Like it\u2019s just such a nuanced situation that I personally find it wild to try to explain away with logic. To me the first logical step would be to not cancel the paid for vacay, but to reschedule it for a month or so later. To completely avoid the issue alltogether. But that wasn\u2019t done. The other alternative is that they are just hands off parents. And that\u2019s their business I guess. But I can\u2019t imagine treating my kid like that if I was a parent. And also if they\u2019re content being that way and acting that way, then logically there\u2019s no place for their upset over the emotional consequences of their actions. Like I\u2019m so confused as to what they thought was going to happen. Just my two cents, not a big arguer on here but I do like to bounce off of other perspectives.", "You sound like an awesome mom & grandma - catching up on the current things for infant care instead of criticizing your daughter for not doing things the old way. I was lucky this way too, but have a couple friends who would non-stop get terrible advice from their mothers or MIL.", "They were already on the vacation. Good insurance will cover a trip being cut short. But that assumes they got insurance", "I wouldn't have even expected my parents to cut a vacation short.", "as someone who was tasked with watching a newborn sibling at age 11 and who has had 3 kids close together I feel like newborns can bounce and stretch like Plastic Man.", "This is unreasonable. Move the vacation to when? Two months after the due date? Six months? By then another kid of theirs might be due to give birth, or another grandkid of theirs could be graduating kindergarten (\u201cHow could you miss little Johnny\u2019s Kindergarten Graduation, you heartless monsters!\u201d), or the daughter will complain she needs them to babysit. It will always be something. \n\nAnd yes I\u2019ve had a c-section, too. I didn\u2019t expect everyone to stop living their lives, or give up their hard-earned vacations.", "My point was that since they booked before she got pregnant, they had plenty of time to reschedule and book different dates", "While I agree with the fact that going to visit a new born right from the airport is a terrible idea; to me it's a clear YTA for the fact that THEY MISSED A CALL BECAUSE THEY WERE BOTH SLEEPING.\n\nTheir daughter was terrified, their son in law probably was too, the birth was taking a long time... And they both just fell asleep so soundly that they couldn't hear the phone when they needed them.\n\nI know what I would do for my daughter and I know what my mom did while in another continent when my sister was in the ICU. She had to be convinced not to jump on a plane because there was no use, and remained glued to her phone until everything had been stabilized just in case she could lend her moral support or help in any way.\n\nI don't know if his daughter MIL and FIL were there to help and have a good relationship with her either; or if they were all alone.\n\nEdit to add: and nowhere in OP's text does it show that his main concern in not going is that they wouldn't be able to be there or that their being there would be harmful. The concern is clearly on losing money/vacation.", "This needs to be higher! There is no concern for his daughter at all (I realize flying back was pretty much impossible according to OP) - it\u2019s all about the money which is pretty sad.", "This. I was in labor 30 hours. Ended in an emergency c-section. My mother was in the same state, 20 mins away but not allowed in due to Covid. She NEVER slept. She stayed by her phone and checked in with us constantly. The entire event was traumatic for me but it was traumatic for my husband as well so I can imagine what her boyfriend is feeling. I don\u2019t think OP is wrong for not being able to jump on a plane home (though it reads to me as is he didn\u2019t actually look at flights, just decided not to \u201cwaste\u201d the money) but they are wrong for being so nonchalant about the entire situation.", "Yes, there\u2019s a lot of subtext here that shows OP and his wife made their daughter feel unimportant, and didn\u2019t feel much concern. \n\nMaternal and infant death rates in the US are higher than most developed countries. Giving birth is not always a routine procedure, and the first time can be super scary. The parents could have done much more to be there for their kid.", "YTA, not for not trying to do the probably impossible and rush home in time from Cancun but for not staying on a call with your daughter or at least staying at the phone and not sleeping through like nothing is happening??? Genuinely sucks you couldn't be there and that's not necessarily your fault, but you seem pretty callous and uncaring about how traumatic this was for her and didn't do the minimum of what you could to offer support. I'd think most parents would WANT to be there and if they couldn't for whatever reason would do everything they can to offer support and try to facetime if possible. She wanted you there and that wasn't *physically* possible but you failed to be there for her *at all*. If my parents acted this way I'd be crushed. You just broke your daughter's heart.\nETA: Why is everyone so hung up on the fact that they physically couldn't be there and somehow that makes them N T A???? No, the issue is they completely checked out emotionally and didn't use the wealth of resources we have to stay in touch in this modern era to offer every ounce of support they could emotionally. Just ugh. YTAAAAAA.", "YTA. Who books a trip the month their daughter is due and just hopes for the best- and doesn\u2019t expect the worst? \n\nYour daughter had a major medical/surgical event not to mention bringing your grandchild into the world and was scared. A good parent would\u2019ve planned better to be available for her or would\u2019ve at least been on zoom/Skype during her labor so she didn\u2019t feel alone. The whole tone of this post just sounds annoyed that their vacation was interrupted and now they are upset that their daughter is annoyed. \n\nSure, you made the decision that your vacay was more important but guess what, now you have to deal with the consequences of that decision. Soooo YTA\n\nOk I see that it was booked far in advance. But they had 9 months to figure how to reschedule without losing a ton of $$$. Also let\u2019s be real, unless you\u2019re staying in a ridiculous resort, Cancun is not crazy expensive.", "YTA.  Th\u00e9 rushing home part was not completely necessary but did you not discuss in advance what would happen if the baby was born early?  And you couldn\u2019t keep your phone on at night?  I keep my phone on at night every night and set to ring for calls from my kids and my parents.  \n\nYou basically were uncommunicative and stubborn and picked your vacation (and money) over your grandchild.  I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first conflict you have had and you\u2019ll be lucky if you get to see that baby without an apology.  Your child was scared and begging for you!  How many parents out there would be honored to be there and honor to still be needed by their child!!!", "It's the biggest day of your daughter's life and you weren't there for her... I'd take it on the chin and accept that you're in the doghouse. If you stand by your decision then cool, but she's not TA for wanting you there either. \n\nWhat I find more interesting is, what do you plan on doing with the result from this Reddit poll? Is it ammo to show your daughter that actually you're NTA but she is? Do you want to know for personal reasons as you feel torn between whether YTA or not? \n\nObviously the former would make YTA. Don't do that. If it's the latter than you probably feel guilty and it wouldn't be a bad thing to communicate that to her. \n\nFor those that seem confused, as a second time mum who is  eight months pregnant... It's not about the parent being in the room for delivery. It's the build up and immediate aftermath. It's crazy traumatizing for some, and having the unconditional love and support of your parents around can really help. I'm very close to my mum and want her around to celebrate / support me..  plus with my first birth, my husband was asleep on the floor next to me when I started haemorrhaging, my mum on the other hand was awake for two days solid and spotted it - saving two lives. The fierce love of a good mum sometimes can't be topped.", "I went in to have them monitor my baby and they were going to release me, but then I spoke to my father on the phone and my blood pressure went up so they decided to induce me."]}
