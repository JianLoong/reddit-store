We were aware my daughter was soon to pop, but her due date wasn\u2019t until the end of this month, mind you these events took place in the beginning of this month. \n\nWe told him that was impossible, and just to follow their birthing plan and to keep us updated. A few hours later we got a call from my daughter updating us then asking when we\u2019d be on our way back and that she really wanted us to be here and that it was taken longer then expected, she was scared, etc. She\u2019s a first time mom so it was expected for her to be scared. My wife and I assured her everything would be fine, but we were unable to just pack up and go. She got upset and hung up on me.\n\nHours later in the middle of the night we missed a call due to us sleeping and it was her boyfriend saying there was complications and they were performing emergency c section. The next morning we called immediately and our daughter told us she was scared and things could\u2019ve went bad and our Cancun trip was more important to us then her, then hung up. We tried to call back but she wouldn\u2019t answer.\n\nThe baby was born healthy and our daughter is okay.

I think it sucks that you weren\u2019t calling to check in/slept through something major. It\u2019s so great that her and the baby are okay, but with an emergency surgery things could have gone a very different way. If my mom was away and couldn\u2019t get to me when I was in labor, she would be constantly calling/texting to make sure everything was going okay and she\u2019d make sure she could answer her phone in case there was an emergency. I would do the same for my babies.. maybe it\u2019s a family thing or a culture thing? But i do think she would\u2019ve felt more supported if you had at least checked in more/answered when there was an emergency. It\u2019s a tough situation all around.

That\u2019s the true issue, not that you were on vacation. This is an easy fix so try to be patient and understanding with her feelings. I had covid when delivering my child and was in labor for 18 hours before I had an emergency c section as well. My parents couldn\u2019t be at the hospital but they were in constant communication with us the entire time. They stayed up all night until the baby was born. It made me feel safe.

I take it your daughter is mad, but it was a no win situation.

Also, a C section is always possible even if not planned.  Life happens and this time it turned out your daughter needed one.\n\nYour daughter & son in law are adults and while perhaps are disappointed that you could not be there for the birth, they  (particularly your daughter) needs to get off their selfish butts.   They are the ones entering the world of parenting.  You and your wife have already been there and done that job.  You had no obligation to be there for the birth and you have nothing to apologize for - so stop doing it! \n\nThe daughter needs to calm down.  She isn't the first person to give birth without her parents nearby.  If she continues to refuse to speak with you and your wife - fine. It is her loss.

She was giving birth in a hospital surrounded by a team of medical professionals. Not a midwife at home.", "That's where I'm at. Is OP an asshole? I d'no. But it sounds like his daughter was terrified and wanted the love and support of her family.", "Just be there! Is the idea of moral support foreign now?", "And the trip was booked before the daughter was pregnant. I doubt the daughter would have wanted to pay the extra last minute fees for their emergency flight", "Jumping on my own comment to point a few other things out. This baby was born premature with a difficult birth. It's very fragile health-wise and has nearly no immune system developed yet. \n\nOP and his wife had spent a week in a tourist town in a foreign country and would have taken a crowded plane there and back. Either one of those facts mean that even if they had dropped everything, it would not have been safe to see mother or baby for several days at the very least. It's peak cold/flu/covid season. I wouldn't let them near a medically fragile newborn for a few weeks.", "Your grandma rocks, that's the best kind of funny, the 'kind' kind :)", "I am from the US also. I had 2 kids. Definitely preferred my parents NOT be there. Way too awkward for me.", "I have two children and between my husband and my doctor I had all the support I needed. Where I'm from , women will get a midwife or a doula if she wants extra support. \n\nThat said, if you want your parents there that's fine, but in that case I assume you would discuss that with them  beforehand and see if that's what they want too and not just expect them to drop everything   suddenly.", "Sounds like it was and they had every intention of being there, but she went into labour early unfortunately.", "My mom was a huge support and advocate for me and my (now) ex with our first son. The second time, both my sister and my mom were present at my home birth with my second (just to be clear, in Canada midwives are regulated and covered just like a hospital birth. We had two attending midwives, one for me one for my son). My sister was there mostly to help my oldest if he woke up, but basically it was all hands on deck at push time, as I was essentially floating and had someone one each limb pushing back against me haha. \n\nAnyways, we are indigenous and matriarchal culturally. It\u2019s very common for female family to be involved in each others births. It\u2019s a really wonderful bonding experience (but obviously not if you have toxic family or even if you just aren\u2019t close in that way. Can make things more stressful).", "Yeah, I had 3 complicated births and it didn't even occur to me to demand my mum be there, and we're really close!", "Are people broadcasting play by plays of their labours?\nI just told me parents when we were heading to the hospital, then sent them a text once the baby was out.\nI was pretty occupied in between...", "This is your daughter\u2026parents move Heaven and earth for their kids. I know my mom and dad would. Hell, my parents would fly from halfway around the world. \n\nWhat kind of parents check out emotionally and go to bed during labour??? They didn\u2019t have to be \u201crested\u201d to be concerned. There\u2019s nothing impossible with staying up all night and getting updates, at the VERY LEAST. I\u2019ve done much more in much less serious circumstances for my family and vice versa. It is a labour. You have a scared daughter. No one just goes to bed, I\u2019m sorry to say.", "That\u2019s something most people would get over in a more rational mindset. Not even being bothered to answer the phone is \u2026 unforgivable is a strong word but I can\u2019t think of one more fitting. \n\nTheir approach felt callous. Like they really couldn\u2019t be bothered to do the barest of minimums.", "OP's said apparently his phone was turned all the way up and by his head and.... I don't buy it. How do you miss a phone call on a phone that's turned all the way up and by your head even if your daughter isn't in an emergency situation?\n\nEven if I could sleep when a loved one was going through that, it would be a really bad night's sleep, like the sleep you have before you have something really important in the morning, like a flight - you panic every time you wake up that you've slept through something important. He apparently went to bed, slept through a ringing phone right next to his head without even stirring, and it was the next morning before he got the message that his daughter had gone into emergency surgery? That phone was definitely on silent.", "Nothing wrong with wanting it. But there was something wrong with the mending it and then lashing out when she didn\u2019t get it.\n\nIf she is adult enough to be a mother, then she is adult enough to get through the situation with her significant other at her side. She does not need mommy and daddy.", "His parents didn\u2019t raise her.", ">There is literally no amount of money on this earth that would keep me from my daughter's side when she gave birth.\n\nUnless you legitimately don't have it. Considering they saved up for an entire a year, there's a good chance they wouldn't be able to afford 2 more tickets.", "I actually looked how much it would be to fly to the airport 1.5 hrs from me from cancun and that's what I got. 7 hour direct flight for $980 for 1 person, or 17hr average flights/layovers for $300 per person. That also doesn't allow time for airport security in Cancun, customs coming into the US, and drive time from the airport. I'm not saying they can't find flights, I'm saying it's unreasonable to think OP could have made it back in time for anything anyway.", "You don\u2019t know that the volume wasn\u2019t on. They could\u2019ve just slept through the ringer.", "Yep, like would I be happy if they decided to come? Yes, but also I would appreciate their right to enjoy themselves. They\u2019re allowed to be able to plan for enjoyable moments between themselves and they\u2019ve already raised their children. The daughter might see it differently one day once she\u2019s in their shoes.", "The daughter just gave birth, she\u2019ll be hormonal for months and she\u2019ll be mad at her parents for awhile but she\u2019ll build a bridge and get over it. Its clear she\u2019s close to them if she wanted her parents at the hospital even though her parents would\u2019ve been useless there. A lot of people wouldn\u2019t want their parents at the hospital while they give birth, c-section or no c-section. And the parents probably got a lot of sun and being exposed to the sun for long periods of time wears you out. It is weird they slept through the phone calls, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that they didn\u2019t leave their trip early. \nI am willing to bet that the parents will be forgiven. Let the daughter keep her distance but odds are she\u2019ll call them and beg for some help.", "Exactly this! They were free to remain on vacation. Daughter is free to keep her distance", "Where is the evidence that her mom was part of the birthing plan? OP literally told Bf \u201cfollow the birthing plan\u201d. If mom had committed to be there, it changes things. But that is not alleged at all.", "OP literally told BF to \u201cfollow the birthing plan\u201d. Apparently there was a plan and the (grand)parents were not integral.\n\nI feel bad that they were asleep when they got a call, but that does happen. Especially when you are on a very-well-planned vacation and are not a part of the birthing plan. I probably could not have slept, and it\u2019s the only part I feel less assured about, but I still think the idea of childbirth has become wayyyyy too much of an \u201cinstagram event ritual\u201d thing, and expectations between generations are skewed.", "Again most hospitals have a 1 person policy, do you really expect your parents to sit in the waiting room for HOURS \ud83d\ude43 ? Moral support doesn\u2019t mean  they have to be there they can give their support and prayer from Cancun", "Didn't occur to mom before she'd asked my grandma either, so apparently anyone can forget. They both burst out laughing and got some confused looks from the nurses. Definitely one of my favorite family stories.", "My mom was in labor with me and the nurses kicked my grandma out because she was causing my mom\u2019s blood pressure to spike.", "LOL, what? How ridiculous.", "Wow. I guess I'd say that parents who trust they raised a child with an ability to cope for a few hours with their partner as support might be able to sleep? It's not quite comparable, but when I had my appendectomy I told all my family to bugger off, they needed rest and I'd need their help after the procedure.", "Yeah, my mom would have canceled the trip as soon as I announced my pregnancy and she did the math. There\u2019s no way she would be out of the country anywhere near the due date, especially for a vacay. \n\nThese replies are blowing me away.", "Fair enough. I do think the bigger issue is them missing the call about the emergency c and not understanding why daughter is hurt. I\u2019m getting boomer \u201cbut if I have reasons your feelings which I find illogical should go away\u201d vibes", "In two other comments, OP says the phone was on, volume was turned up, and it was on the desk near his head -- they just slept through it.", "Especially given that the trip was planned and paid for before they knew she was pregnant. There should have been communication after announcing said pregnancy.", "Super true, she may see it different when she\u2019s older and raised her child.\nI\u2019m sure I have my own bias too, but having parents with a toxic relationship my whole entire life, I love seeing parents enjoying themselves after together!  I would hope my kids would be happy about it too.", "This is my point exactly. \n\nStrangers are not required or morally obligated to miss vacations for other strangers medical emergencies.\n\nParents are (in my opinion) morally obligated to if they expect to maintain a relationship with their children.\n\nAs parents you should want to be there for your kids big moments, especially when they involve major medical problems.", "\u201cWe had planned to be there for our grandchild\u2019s birth, but we couldn\u2019t leave 6 days into a trip we spent a large amount of money on.\u201d \nIn the OP.", "This is so wholesome I love your family already \ud83e\udd23", "Haha that is funny! My mom was with me in the delivery room with both of my kids (first was an emergency c-section and second was an induced vbac). She had no idea what to do because my parents adopted my brother and I too (as infants though) but I'm still so glad she was there with me.", " Not that ridiculous, people die giving birth all the time especially in the US. The fact that they just went to sleep and didnt even set the phone loud enough to wake them up is insane to me.", "What are they supposed to do from a foreign country? You're mad because they didn't wake up when they heard their phone?  Wild.  \n\n\"They didn't drive themselves crazy with anxiety and force themselves to be sleep deprived! They're terrible parents!\"\n\nWildddddd.\n\nI love blaming people for what they do when they're unconscious.  It's hilarious."]}
