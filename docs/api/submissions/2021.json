For an 18 year old, it sounds like he has his head screwed on pretty damned well, even if it may seem unconventional to others.", "If he's genuinely going to save the money then that's a smart move on his part. I agree as his first car he didn't need anything fancy. Money is more valuable than a car which loses its value every time you get behind the wheel.", "NTA, it's ok, he just saved you the first 22k in college costs.", "NTA. But I nunderstand him. Be grateful that you have a kid, who\u2019s so smart about long term plans etc. now you know how concerned about his future he is and you can adopt your gifts accordingly. So many young people have no pension plans, no savings etc. it\u2019s scary!", "NAH\n\n\nSplitting the cost would still put him in dept. 20.000 less dept is a lot. \n\n\nMy feelings would be hurt too but you should be a little proud of his decision too.", "NTA. I would have been hurt too. But my concern is you not knowing your son better. I would have hoped you knew him well enough to look at a used car or how he felt about the future. But it sounds like you have raised a good son.", "NTA.  Yes, it was a gift and legally his to do with as he wanted, but he's still an AH for looking such a generous gift horse in the mouth. And as someone who drove a beater in college but a much nicer/reliable car in grad school, I disagree with those saying this was a smart financial move. He's going to have maintenance expenses that he never would have had with the new car.  It would have been better for him to drive the new car all through college and *then* sell it to pay off student loans. In addition, $20k is not that much in the grand scheme of college expenses, but having a reliable means of transportation can make a big difference in your life.\n\nI feel like those calling OP an AH would still call OP an AH if OP now rescinded their offer to pay for half of college.  Yet OP has just as much right to not give a gift as the son did to sell the one he received. Sometimes you can act within your rights and still be TA.", "NAH/ESH, but you both could've benefited from better communication.\n\nHe could've been upfront about wanting to sell the car, rather than presenting it as a \"fait accompli\". After all, it hurts your feelings having put thought into selecting presumably a nice car for him.\n\nIf you had communicated to him \"son, we'd like to buy you a new car\", he could've expressed he'd rather drive a beater and save money.\n\nInstead, you've now both hurt eachothers feelings, amd wasted a couple of grand in the process. I'm going on an assumption that you'll be hard-pressed to find a dealer who'll buy back for sticker value.\n\nWhether the judgement is NAH or ESH is dependent on how harsh you are to yourself.", "No assholes here. You have a right to be upset but he didn\u2019t do anything wrong either. Once it was gifted it was his to do with as he wants.", "NTA, what he did was shrewd but rude", "omg. Just omg. \n\nNTA. And No presents for you!\n\nI would feel like the soup nazzzy.\n\nI'd lose the rest of my mind. \ud83e\udd23", "NAH. I get that you are upset. But who would be paying the insurance? Maintenance? Is his school in a higher crime area? Sure, brand new wheels are nice. They are also extremely expensive for young drivers. \n\nYour son made a wise choice financially provided his used car is a reliable one. And having a solid plan for the profits is good thinking on his part. \n\nAgain, I can see why you would be miffed, but in this economy he made a good choice.", "NTA. That would feel like I got a slap in the face. I would never sell a gift; especially not a car. I've received 2 cars (both 2nd hand) and driven them until they physically couldn't go any more- even then, I never sold them. As a parent, you have the right to lecture your offspring.", "I think he made a wise decision. 22k less student dept is a lot. I\u2019d be proud that the sees that a 30k car is not necessary, especially not if it means he will have a college debt haunting him even longer. I get your disappointed that your gift didn\u2019t turn out to be what he wanted but try to be understanding. Times have seriously changed since you and I were 18. The economic outlook of our kids is frightening for them.", "YTA\n\nIt was a gift. You gave him a gift. You don't get to control what he does with his gift.\n\nYour son is also smart enough to realize at 18 ..he didn't need a brand new car ( don't forget he has to pay for the reg and maintenance...which is expensive on new vehicles). He knows he has to afford college, books, rent, etc.... He knew the better investment was to drive a beater car and save the money to help further himself.\n\nBe proud of him. He really is thinning about his future and long term goals...most 18 year olds aren't at that point yet.", "Did you consult on the purchase with him beforehand?  There's a huge cost of ownership variance from one kind of car to another. Did he get one that's cheaper to maintain? \n\nAlso insurance rates and registration on new vehicles are crazy expensive for a teen to pay, compared to a used car. \n\nI can understand your confusion but just look at the cash aspect.  Next time you want to give a gift thats a big investment,  see if it's what is actually useful or needed.", "30k what? American dollars I assume? I\u2019d say that you\u2019re NTA, and he\u2019s not very smart about it. That new car you bought him would have lasted him many years if he took good care of it, compared to an older second-hand car. Sounds to me like he should learn that lesson the hard way in the future since he wanted to be so \u201dsmart\u201d now when selling it. \n\nHe was free to do what he wanted with your gift, but selling it was ungrateful of him. I\u2019d say leave it for now, and see if his judgement turns out to have been good or bad. I would be reluctant to buy him expensive gifts in the next 10 years though, my parents would never ever have bought me such an expensive car.", "Nta but now you know not to give him extravagant gifts.Of course selling your gifts is considered rude. Let him know its fine that he sold it but this is the last car you will ever pay for because he doesn't appreciate your gifts.", "NAH. You can't dictate what people do with a gift. I understand your frustration...yet he is free to do with a gift whatever he pleases. No one is the AH....yet. if he uses the excess funds for nefarious purposes like drugs? You're more in the right here. If he uses the financial gain for bills, school, down-payment on a house, etc. You should be proud to have raised a child who sees value in money and not having a fancy car. This could go either way but from your post alone no one is an AH here. If you give a gift you have no say on the outcome of said gift.", "NAH. He's your son and it's your gift and whatnot so like you do you, but just imo it's weird to make a big purchase like that for someone without involving them in the decision-making process.", "NAH, he made a reasonable financial choice but you\u2019re valid to feel hurt.", "INFO: Who was paying the insurance on the new car? Did you buy it outright, or on payments? The insurance on new cars is ridiculous for young male drivers, even moreso if you have to have the coverage required for a car that is being paid off.", "NAH. With such a large gift it seems it would have been wise to talk to him about it first. He could have told you at that point that he'd prefer you cover more of his education rather than a new car. However it was a generous gift.", "You might not like what he did, but I\u2019m floored that he did something so prudent. He could have done this and taken the $$ and gone traveling\u2026 problem with 2nd hand jalopies is that major parts fail when you least expect it. Hopefully he wasn\u2019t penny wise and pound foolish.", "YTA you don't get to decide what people do with a gift once you give it to them.", "YTA If you're mad about this.\n\nOne cannot give gifts with strings.  (I give you a car and you MUST USE IT).  It sounds like you gave him the title which means you are SOL.  It sounds like your son has a better handle on his future financial plans than you do.  Perhaps you should talk to him about finances instead of a half remembered promise to \"help him split the costs\".  \n\nWho blows $30k on a car for a teenager anyway?", "The fact that he\u2019s not all about the flash car and showing off and is practical and sensible should make you proud but it does seem mercenary, but is actually the opposite. NAH", "Maybe he sold it so he could afford his split of college. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your son has good financial sense. He sounds like he\u2019ll do well in life.", "If you have so much money, why don't you just offer to pay for his tuition (entire rather than split) rather than give him a ridiculously expensive gift? The kid is right. YTA for telling him that he disrespected you. You're free to feel hurt, but he made a rational choice and you shouldn't emotionally blackmail him.", "YTA your son sounds like a sensible guy who realises that he doesn't need a 30K car but money for his future. I would be proud of him.", "NAH, he probably should have talked to you about it but technically it's his right", "Depends, If he actually intends to save the money for college, then you YTA for not understanding the challenges of modern life, he intends to use the money to party and have a good time, then NTA.", "Slight YTA\n\nIt's *his* car... He can do with it what he wants. It's definitely not strange to take your given gift to the shop and return it for something you can use better. \n\nIn this case he can use the money better.... \"Splitting costs\" for college still means he's going to be deep in debt when he's done.\n\nActually... You should be proud of him for not being materialistic and having a clear goal for his future! \n\n>\"If I'm going to survive long-term in the 21st century, I need to save as much as possible.\"\n\nAnd he's right!", "YTA. especially if you reduce how much you contribute to his education because of this", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They would like to gift something expensive to me with very good intentions, but I cant really enjoy it knowing that with the amount of money they have spent on the gift I could have solved some of my issues in life. For one example once we were shopping, and my mom bought some jewelry for herself. She asked if I also want something, and I told her that I don\u2019t feel comfortable spending money on jewelry while there are many things I need the money for, like  fixing things at my home, replacing broken household items, etc. A few weeks later I had my birthday and she gifted me the necklace we saw together. I got upset, and she got sad. Smaller but similar.", "NAH. I think it's reasonable you're offended. Just don't buy him nice stuff going forward, if you want to give him something just get him the cash.", "NAH. He needed money for college more than a brand-new car. I would have done the exact same thing.", "YTA. He's right. You should be proud of him!", "This! \n\nOp, take a step back and bask in the fact that you guys raised a kid that sees more value in saving than flashy things! I've seen so many posts on this subreddit where parents complain that their children have done the opposite (gotten a sensible car and demanded something unnecessarily flashy). \n\nI understand it probably stings a bit but honestly, I'd be bragging to anybody who'd listen to me (and to quite a few who didn't care to)! \n\n\"We got our son an expensive car and the little brat decided that collage was more important! I'm so proud! Just like that! He saw a way to make collage easier on himself and us and traded down his car!\" \n\nNah", "Also, the insurance and upkeep for a 30K brand-new car is likely significantly more than the costs for a no-frills used car.\n\nYes, you got him an amazing gift. You also got him an ongoing expense, unless your gift included paying those additional costs.\n\nI think the thing that struck me the most is that you were surprised.

And the used car I gave my son to go away to school cost more than that. Its not a lot of money when you're talking about buying a car - not these days?", "Although insurance is less for an old car because of lower replacement cost, upkeep is generally higher. New cars require comparatively little maintenance. And new cars often get better fuel mileage, much better in the case of hybrids.\n\nStill NAH though, as OP\u2019s son had a better use (in his understandable opinion) for the money from selling the car.", "> upkeep is generally higher. New cars require comparatively little maintenance.\n\nIt\u2019s going to depend a lot on the actual car, and new models often have teething issues. \n\nIf the son is handy, maintenance is also a lot easier on an older or less technologically complicated car (which I\u2019d expect of one with non-electric windows).\n\nAs for mileage, that\u2019s very variable: older cars have less efficient engines, but also less powerful ones and lower kerb weight.
