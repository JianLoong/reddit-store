For an 18 year old, it sounds like he has his head screwed on pretty damned well, even if it may seem unconventional to others.", "If he's genuinely going to save the money then that's a smart move on his part. I agree as his first car he didn't need anything fancy. Money is more valuable than a car which loses its value every time you get behind the wheel.", "NTA, it's ok, he just saved you the first 22k in college costs.", "NTA. But I nunderstand him.

I would have been hurt too. But my concern is you not knowing your son better. I would have hoped you knew him well enough to look at a used car or how he felt about the future. But it sounds like you have raised a good son.", "NTA.  Yes, it was a gift and legally his to do with as he wanted, but he's still an AH for looking such a generous gift horse in the mouth. And as someone who drove a beater in college but a much nicer/reliable car in grad school, I disagree with those saying this was a smart financial move. He's going to have maintenance expenses that he never would have had with the new car.  It would have been better for him to drive the new car all through college and *then* sell it to pay off student loans. In addition, $20k is not that much in the grand scheme of college expenses, but having a reliable means of transportation can make a big difference in your life.\n\nI feel like those calling OP an AH would still call OP an AH if OP now rescinded their offer to pay for half of college.  Yet OP has just as much right to not give a gift as the son did to sell the one he received. Sometimes you can act within your rights and still be TA.", "NAH/ESH, but you both could've benefited from better communication.\n\nHe could've been upfront about wanting to sell the car, rather than presenting it as a \"fait accompli\".

There's a huge cost of ownership variance from one kind of car to another.

Sounds to me like he should learn that lesson the hard way in the future since he wanted to be so \u201dsmart\u201d now when selling it. \n\nHe was free to do what he wanted with your gift, but selling it was ungrateful of him. I\u2019d say leave it for now, and see if his judgement turns out to have been good or bad. I would be reluctant to buy him expensive gifts in the next 10 years though, my parents would never ever have bought me such an expensive car.", "Nta but now you know not to give him extravagant gifts.Of course selling your gifts is considered rude.

If he uses the financial gain for bills, school, down-payment on a house, etc. You should be proud to have raised a child who sees value in money and not having a fancy car. This could go either way but from your post alone no one is an AH here. If you give a gift you have no say on the outcome of said gift.", "NAH. He's your son and it's your gift and whatnot so like you do you, but just imo it's weird to make a big purchase like that for someone without involving them in the decision-making process.", "NAH, he made a reasonable financial choice but you\u2019re valid to feel hurt.", "INFO: Who was paying the insurance on the new car? Did you buy it outright, or on payments? The insurance on new cars is ridiculous for young male drivers, even moreso if you have to have the coverage required for a car that is being paid off.", "NAH.

However it was a generous gift.", "You might not like what he did, but I\u2019m floored that he did something so prudent.

She asked if I also want something, and I told her that I don\u2019t feel comfortable spending money on jewelry while there are many things I need the money for, like  fixing things at my home, replacing broken household items, etc. A few weeks later I had my birthday and she gifted me the necklace we saw together.

The reason he gave does track with his actions, and it legitimately seems like he just values money more than luxury. You're very generous to him, but you have to realize when it becomes his property he has a right to leverage it to make investments to give himself the best shot at life. A $30,000 car is extremely unnecessary for an 18 year old and it seems like he knows that better than you.\n\nNow, why you didn't let him tell you he just wanted cash is just beyond me.

It was also a gift so he owns it and after all it is in his name so he can do whatever he wants with it.", "I'd disagree on almost all counts of that. He has a car that was in the 7-8K range, that's not likely to rack up 20K in extra expenses any time soon.\n\nAnd 20K is a whole lot in the grand scheme of college expenses depending on where you're going. That can be a a couple years' tuition.\n\n\nIf OP is going to dictate how a gift can be used like that then it wasn't a gift, it was an obligation.", "Something else that needs to be considered is the cost of insurance. The more expensive his car is, the more expensive it becomes to insure. \n\nI know OP felt like he was doing his son a major favor (and he was!), but cars are a financial obligation even after you've paid it off. It seems like OP and his wife simply weren't aware of their child's priorities or mindset, but I'm certain their son appreciates the assistance just as much as they wished for him to.", ">Also, the insurance and upkeep for a 30K brand-new car is likely significantly more than the costs for a no-frills used car.\n\nI apologize if I sound argumentative, I just wanted to share that insurance and upkeep could be cheaper (for now) on the new car. Depending on just *how* old the other car is, it could cost more due to the lack of safety features on it. Things like ABS, numerous airbags, and collision mitigation systems, are just a few options that make a difference.\n\nAs for upkeep, being brand new means it should come with a (hopefully) decent warranty. If you avoid the first year of a new model generation, or a mid-gen face-lift model, you shouldn't have as many new car growing pains. If you do, hooray for warranties lol\n\nI still think the young man made a very wise decision though. He's 18.

Basically, your family just threw away 8K for not communicating.", "NAH really but a soft  Y T A to you and your wife.\n\nIt is almost time for my son to have a car and we've talked quite a bit about the price and how if we spend X on the car that is Y less he has to spend on other things.\n\nI'm guiding him, of course, but this is a decision I want him to be a part of.  I actually want this to be mostly his decision.  I've narrowed down his car options to ones I'm comfortable with and he's thinking about his priorities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think it would have been better for you to have actually talked to your son first to find out how he would have wanted to allocate $30K towards his life.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE was much more reasonable than you. If you had any sense, you would have given him a budget, and let him chose his car himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Does this really mean you have to sell gifts other people give you?\" .. You don't HAVE to. But you CAN. - What else would you do with shitty gifts?", "Your son was very smart.\n\nHe has a point. He needs to save up.\n\nAnd let me tell you one more thing, he will eventually sell the car, the only difference is that the more you drive it the more you have to undersell it. \n\nBy doing it now he got a fair profit from it, managed to still get a car to be able to drive around, and money for college and other expenses.\n\nIt mightve come off as disrespectful to you, but I would have done the exact same. If my parents gifted me a pretty expensive car where I wasn't gonna be able to even afford the maintenance on it and all, I would've done the same thing. \n\nSometimes you forget that gifting someone a car can be more of a financial burden rather than help. A car comes with costs. Insurance. Tax. Gas/petrol. And repairs.\n\nHaving a 30.000$ car means he has either an amazing insurance policy (but wr all know those come at an extra cost) or he'd have to sell his body to be able to afford repairs.\n\nNow what you did was nice to get him that car, but maybe you should've let him pick his own or decide what to get. \n\nOnce you gift something you lose the power of saying in whatever happens to that item.\n\nI'll be even more specific.\n\nMy sister gifted me a pandora bracelet with charms. I don't wear bracelets but whatever. \n\nI don't care about the sentiment behind it. I sold it while it still had value and kept the money. She doesn't know but I don't care. It isn't her place to make choices on what I keep or not. \n\nSame goes for most gifts I've received that I won't use. \n\nI don't care if that makes me the asshole. But it's financial responsibility in my eyes as why should I keep something that's eventually gonna be thrown out when it has no value anymore?\n\nEdit to add: YTA.", "YTA. It was a major purchase that you made without consulting him at all. He didn't want inexpensive car, so you gave him a gift he didn't want and he went and got what he actually wanted. It doesn't sound like you have a place to be offended when this entire situation was brought out of you not listening to him", "YTA I know you think you were giving him a great gift here, but I can see elsewhere you've said you didn't discuss with him which car you'd be buying and I think that was a mistake. If you had sat him down and said \"you can either have a 30k car or a 10k car and 20k towards your college\" he could've told you how he would like the money to be spent before you actually spent it. Yes it's a gift, but when we're talking about such large amounts of money I really think the recipient should be a bit more involved so you're not just wasting 30k.", "I completely respect how everyone is admiring this young man for being mature and responsible; however, the issue was not money it\u2019s principal. If he was so mature and responsible he could\u2019ve come to his parents and said let\u2019s take this car back and get something cheaper so I can use the difference in the money to pay for my education. It has a high possibility Carmax did not give him the truth value of this car with his parents could\u2019ve just taken it back and got the money back and it\u2019s entirety. Wow his intentions are well. It does appear to be very disrespectful to his parents.   I\u2019d also like to add, housing and travel expenses are our two highest bills every month. Here he is with a fully pay for a car they may not give him problems for another 7 to 10 years. I do know people who are still driving 2007 cars in 2022 that are still running perfectly fine. So going out and get a used car they may start to give him problems in the next couple years may not have been the best use of his money.", "INFO: \n\n1) Did you discuss the gift with him ahead of time? \n2) Did you buy with cash or take out a loan? \n\nI think NAH, but if you took out a loan I could see how you'd be hurt paying for something for years that he sold right away.  Still, a gift is a gift and it is a really good idea to communicate about large gifts ahead of time.", "NAH. Technically, you are right to be hurt that he sold his car, but once the gift is gifted is not longer yours to care about. But honestly, financially he did the right move, I applause your son for being so mature and reasonable at such a young age.", "NTA - he should not have done it behind your back. What he did was shifty and weird, and I would question it myself.", "From the title I was expecting him to sell your gift and get somthing flashy he wants. Nope. Pleasantly surprised to see this young man decided to make a rather sensible decision. That car you got was outside this poor kids means. A 30k vehicle costs more to upkeep with insurance and newer parts when somthing breaks. You grew up in a time when luxuries like this are great but in our time.... you gotta save and be a frugal as possible to survive when your young and have limited resources. NTA, I understand you are upset but I know it comes from a misinformed place. He made the right call and you should be proud of him for it", "Perhaps refrain from buying any more gifts and also once the car breaks drown, he can use the profits to repair it. I\u2019m sure the safety features and gas mileage are amazing too. A nice thing to do would have to ask you to return the car and get him a cheaper one. NTA", "NAH. I can see how you would be taken aback by him selling the new car. But your kid is smart, smart, smart though and you should be proud of him. Splitting the costs for college means he'll be paying a lot and it makes far more sense for him to avoid going into debt as much as possible.", "Top work on raising a smart son.  He can make his 22K grow, rather than reduce in a depreciating asset.", "I'm going with NAH.   \n\n\nUltimately you and your wife should have discussed it properly with your son. A new car isn't just something you go out and buy on a whim. If there was 30k on the table anyway, your son should have had some input imo.   \n\n\nI can see how it would be annoying, but think of it this way. You and your wife have managed to raise a son who knows the value of saving, and is willing to sacrifice a decent car for something else, so he is able to put the money towards his future. If anything you should be proud. Just a shame it happened a bit ass-backwards.", "It really sounds like you bought a car without actually consulting your son on what he'd like to have. A car isn't a small, inconsequential purchase. This is something that he's going to be using daily for maybe a decade. \n\nHe made the (very adult, if you ask me) choice of taking the car that you bought him and trading it in for something that he feels like he's going to be comfortable with using, and is putting the money towards something that is going to better his life in the long run. \n\nYou're being weird about it. YTA.", "NAH. OP whilst you meant well, I feel your gift was a little ill thought out. Maybe more what you wanted to give, rather than what he actually wanted. You agreed to split college costs, but I\u2019m assuming his share would still be a sizeable amount. So he\u2019s investing in his future rather than having a fancy car. I think you did a great job raising him. But - he should have discussed it with you before selling it.", "NTA.", "JFC. You should be proud of him for having such insight. YTA.", "YTA.  This isn't a family heirloom we are talking about.  There is no sentimental value to this car for you or him.  Hell, if my parents bought me a brand new car without my input, I would probably sell it too just because I would want to drive something that I picked out. My parents would likely pick out something that screams \"70-year-old going through a late quarter crisis\".\n\nConsider your son is carving out his own identity.  Maybe he doesn't want to go to college with everyone assuming he's a pampered rich kid.", "NTA but now he has an $22k of your money.  You can now scale back what you give him, he doesn't seem very appreciative.", "INFO: did you just pick a car, or did he have any input?", "NTA this was kind of a sneaky way for him to get you to pay more than what you originally promised for school to be honest. I get where he was coming from wanting to have money for school, but he should have been upfront that he intended to sell it immediately bc I guarantee you wouldn't have gotten the 30k car if he told you that before you bought it.", "NAH - Technically he has the right to do that.  Lesson learned.  In the future, beware the fact he might sale your gifts to him.  \n\nFYI - If you have any more children in the future, keep the vehicle you get them in your name.  Not just for this reason.  If they run off and get married, put their spouse on the title, and then get a divorce, the spouse may have a right to half the vehicle in some states.\n\nEdit do to mispelling.", "NTA because despite what he did making financial sense, that doesn't excuse the rudeness of selling a very expensive gift immediately. Anything else around asking if he had input into the purchase or praise for good financial sense is just irrelevancy around the edges of the argument. He was rude and you were NTA for pointing this out.  \n\nThat aside, it's pretty savvy and an admirable sacrifice he's making from a purely financial perspective. He should have at least informed you first though. Still, at 18 his judgement is still very immature so bear that in mind.", "NTA", "NAH. You are raising a smart kid, though.", "You're an asshole, once a gift is given you have no say over what is done with that gift. Did you even ask him what he wanted?", "YTA for giving a grand gift he neither wanted or needed. This was a big purchase, and this can't be the first time he's ever expressed to you that savings are important to him. \n\nWhy wouldn't you talk to your kid before doing something like this?", "YTA\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you just ask him what he wanted to do with the $30K?\n\nInstead he had to do the dog and pony show.  \n\nAnd you are in charge of your expectations, and disappointment, not your son.", "YTA...  it was a gift.  You got him something that he didn't want, that also has ongoing ownership costs (insurance).  You really didn't know your son's feelings about getting a new car before you got him a new car?", "We had agreed he would get a car at some point, but this was technically a surprise.", "I just hope he did not buy crypto with this 22k", "With your comment its more a NAH then N ta. Nta would mean op isnt an ah but the son is", "I also don't understand how they are able to drop 30k on a brand new car for a teenager but only go halfsies on college.", "> It's definitely not strange to take your given gift to the shop and return it for something you can use better. \n\nYeah but usually you don't do it immediately and in front of the gift giver. One doesn't tell 'Aunt Flo' that her generous gift of brown corduroy flares would have more appropriate in 1970 - one says thank you and then goes quietly to the clothing store to change it later. And that's just good manners when dealing with a low value gift. A high value gift exchange should be treated with kid gloves.", " OP has said no, they had talked about buying him a car but this was \u201ctechnically a surprise\u201d.\n\nA freaking $30k surprise.", "\nIt\u2019s great that you got cars as gifts.

I expected to see more YTA with reasons like you gave here", "Nothing wrong with second hand cars. My dad picked up one for 600 bucks and we had it for around 5-6 years before the canny blighter managed to sell it for a profit. Didn't have any major issues other than a crappy paint job. If you're looking right it's not completely uncommon to find well maintained older vehicles that have only had one or two previous owners. My first car I bought off my elderly neighbour after he went into a nursing home. Low kms, had always gotten regular service checks, only ever had a minor problem with it after I went to a dodgy mechanic when I was getting the fan belt replaced.", "Why would he have to be upfront, once the gift is given its no longer OPs and he gets no say. He can't get all butt hurt now.", "Once a gift is given its not yours! You don't get to dictate what someone does with it.", "Even though gifting such an expensive car is very nice, its also going to cost him alot in extra expenses in insurance and maintenance.\n\nI think your son is acting very smart, you should be proud.\n\nNAH", "And who was going to pay for the insurance on a $30k car? Were you going to pay it the whole time he had it?", "So he had zero input.

It's a very generous gift, but you also have to understand that represents a suitable chunk of an education or a deposit on a house - if you'd asked him before spending that kind of money on him, he might have looked for those things over a vehicle that he had to insure and that will lose value over time.\n\nI think that you're overreacting in treating this as disrespect.", "Info: So he had zero input?", "The kid did tell them, OP says so in the post. They should have listened to him. Also new used cars are in huge demand because order times are still backed up. I doubt he lost much on the sale, if any (OP says he made 22k and still got a car).

So basically they get to give something big and flashy that people will see and they can claim credit for, and then not spend so much on tuition.", "How can he not do it in front of them? It's a car.", "Yo, I think people are focusing on the money of it and thinking about how offended they would be if someone gave away something they spent $30,000 on.
