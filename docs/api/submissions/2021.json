For an 18 year old, it sounds like he has his head screwed on pretty damned well, even if it may seem unconventional to others.", "If he's genuinely going to save the money then that's a smart move on his part. I agree as his first car he didn't need anything fancy. Money is more valuable than a car which loses its value every time you get behind the wheel.", "NTA, it's ok, he just saved you the first 22k in college costs.", "NTA. But I nunderstand him.

I would have been hurt too. But my concern is you not knowing your son better. I would have hoped you knew him well enough to look at a used car or how he felt about the future. But it sounds like you have raised a good son.", "NTA.  Yes, it was a gift and legally his to do with as he wanted, but he's still an AH for looking such a generous gift horse in the mouth. And as someone who drove a beater in college but a much nicer/reliable car in grad school, I disagree with those saying this was a smart financial move. He's going to have maintenance expenses that he never would have had with the new car.  It would have been better for him to drive the new car all through college and *then* sell it to pay off student loans. In addition, $20k is not that much in the grand scheme of college expenses, but having a reliable means of transportation can make a big difference in your life.\n\nI feel like those calling OP an AH would still call OP an AH if OP now rescinded their offer to pay for half of college.  Yet OP has just as much right to not give a gift as the son did to sell the one he received. Sometimes you can act within your rights and still be TA.", "NAH/ESH, but you both could've benefited from better communication.\n\nHe could've been upfront about wanting to sell the car, rather than presenting it as a \"fait accompli\".

There's a huge cost of ownership variance from one kind of car to another.

Sounds to me like he should learn that lesson the hard way in the future since he wanted to be so \u201dsmart\u201d now when selling it. \n\nHe was free to do what he wanted with your gift, but selling it was ungrateful of him. I\u2019d say leave it for now, and see if his judgement turns out to have been good or bad. I would be reluctant to buy him expensive gifts in the next 10 years though, my parents would never ever have bought me such an expensive car.", "Nta but now you know not to give him extravagant gifts.Of course selling your gifts is considered rude.

I understand your frustration...yet he is free to do with a gift whatever he pleases. No one is the AH....yet. if he uses the excess funds for nefarious purposes like drugs? You're more in the right here. If he uses the financial gain for bills, school, down-payment on a house, etc. You should be proud to have raised a child who sees value in money and not having a fancy car. This could go either way but from your post alone no one is an AH here. If you give a gift you have no say on the outcome of said gift.", "NAH. He's your son and it's your gift and whatnot so like you do you, but just imo it's weird to make a big purchase like that for someone without involving them in the decision-making process.", "NAH, he made a reasonable financial choice but you\u2019re valid to feel hurt.", "INFO: Who was paying the insurance on the new car? Did you buy it outright, or on payments? The insurance on new cars is ridiculous for young male drivers, even moreso if you have to have the coverage required for a car that is being paid off.", "NAH.

However it was a generous gift.", "You might not like what he did, but I\u2019m floored that he did something so prudent. He could have done this and taken the $$ and gone traveling\u2026 problem with 2nd hand jalopies is that major parts fail when you least expect it.

For one example once we were shopping, and my mom bought some jewelry for herself. She asked if I also want something, and I told her that I don\u2019t feel comfortable spending money on jewelry while there are many things I need the money for, like  fixing things at my home, replacing broken household items, etc. A few weeks later I had my birthday and she gifted me the necklace we saw together.

The reason he gave does track with his actions, and it legitimately seems like he just values money more than luxury. You're very generous to him, but you have to realize when it becomes his property he has a right to leverage it to make investments to give himself the best shot at life. A $30,000 car is extremely unnecessary for an 18 year old and it seems like he knows that better than you.\n\nNow, why you didn't let him tell you he just wanted cash is just beyond me.

It was also a gift so he owns it and after all it is in his name so he can do whatever he wants with it.", "I'd disagree on almost all counts of that. He has a car that was in the 7-8K range, that's not likely to rack up 20K in extra expenses any time soon.\n\nAnd 20K is a whole lot in the grand scheme of college expenses depending on where you're going. That can be a a couple years' tuition.\n\n\nIf OP is going to dictate how a gift can be used like that then it wasn't a gift, it was an obligation.", "Something else that needs to be considered is the cost of insurance. The more expensive his car is, the more expensive it becomes to insure. \n\nI know OP felt like he was doing his son a major favor (and he was!), but cars are a financial obligation even after you've paid it off. It seems like OP and his wife simply weren't aware of their child's priorities or mindset, but I'm certain their son appreciates the assistance just as much as they wished for him to.", ">Also, the insurance and upkeep for a 30K brand-new car is likely significantly more than the costs for a no-frills used car.\n\nI apologize if I sound argumentative, I just wanted to share that insurance and upkeep could be cheaper (for now) on the new car. Depending on just *how* old the other car is, it could cost more due to the lack of safety features on it. Things like ABS, numerous airbags, and collision mitigation systems, are just a few options that make a difference.\n\nAs for upkeep, being brand new means it should come with a (hopefully) decent warranty. If you avoid the first year of a new model generation, or a mid-gen face-lift model, you shouldn't have as many new car growing pains. If you do, hooray for warranties lol\n\nI still think the young man made a very wise decision though. He's 18.

Obviously your son thinks more frugally than you do, and felt he was better off to downsize and save the money. That's not a bad thing. That sounds like living frugally is just his personality and nature. Let him be him.

You got him a gift that was as much of an obligation/financial sinkhole as it was a gift. Newer cars cost much more money to repair and insure than beaters. Not only did he save an extra 22k on selling it, but he also probably saved over 2k a year on insurance and maintenance costs. I get why you're upset, but tbh I'd be pretty upset if my parents knew I was taking on debt for college, had 30k to drop, and wasted it on a new car instead of my tuition.

We live in an uncertain world and the fact that your son is smart enough to avoid getting into debt, and save money, when so many are spendthrifts, shows an unusual level of maturity that you might want to study.  \n\nYou had multiple choices here to avoid this situation, and they all began with talking to your son first before making assumptions on what he wanted and needed.  If you had talked to him first, he might have said, *\"Hey, thank you so much for offering to buy me an expensive car, but what I really want is to stay out of debt.  Could you help me that way instead?\"*  \n\nYou never told him when you gifted the car that he could not sell it.  You made that assumption.  I think that your anger is misguided.  You surely aren't angry that your son is being smart and resourceful, so what you are angry about is that you can't get the enjoyment out of seeing him drive the car you picked out and bought for him.  \n\nI would apologize to him and commend him on thinking maturely and responsibly about his future.", "YTA.

The giver spends that amount knowing it will be used for a specific purpose.\n\nThe parents wanted to gift him a car; instead they wound up gifting him a car AND 22K in cash.\n\nMaybe I am cynical here. But the fact that the son didn't even OFFER the money back to his parents makes me wonder if he's in some trouble and really needs the 22k. \n\nEdited to add: NTA. Everyone is assuming OP is rolling in money and didn't even consider thst he and his wife could have been SAVING for this car, because they really wanted their son to have a nice car.
