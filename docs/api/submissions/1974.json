Exposure to different foods was a great part of preschool for my kids. We were always grateful for the variety of what people shared. \n\nI\u2019m guessing the other parent has insecurities about their own financial situation and knowing they can\u2019t afford that fruit or even needing to explain that to their preschooler (also an important lesson for any kid in my mind, that money isn\u2019t infinite and we always make choices to use it), is uncomfortable for them. They\u2019re going to have to face that regardless, it\u2019s not your doing.", "NTA Learned something new today. Never realized persimmons were considered an expensive fruit", "NTA\n\nIf the parent complained about that because her kids said something and she can't buy an \"expensive\" fruit, then it's time for her to teach her kids about what she can and can't buy, and that they can take advantage of the fruits offered. Why is that parent feeling so vexed? Seriously", "NTA...I think it's great to treat children to as many different fruits and vegetables as possible.  The other mom is likely just miserable and needs to complain about anything.", "NTA\nAll the kids get the expensive fruit. The poor kids getting it at least at daycare is better than them never getting any.", "NTA. that's a politics move from the other parents. ignore them", "NTA\n\nI think it's nice that you considered exposing them to different fruits other parents may not be able to afford or maybe just not even think to buy. I would keep it up. Tell them your child prefers that fruit so you buy what she likes.", "NTA. You meant well, did good and should be praised for providing something not everyone has access to. I mean, if those parents could score a ride in an expensive car, would it be fair to deny it to them because they can never possibly get enough money to buy it themselves? Should we deny bungee jumping / sky diving because people naturally cannot fly? \n\nThis is an issue of their parents, who do not want to explain to their spoiled kids that they cannot get anything their point their finger on", "NTA\nWhat a strange thing to raise a fuss over. If you were buying things like wagyu steak for the kids that would be a different story....but fruit? You give enough for everyone to have some, and if the mom escalates it further, just tell her what you said here: it can be considered a special treat at daycare.", "Oh no, how terrible. These other kids get to experience eating something out of the ordinary for them, that their parents aren't paying for.\n\nNTA. You aren't insisting other parents provide those fruits as well. You are providing fruit you know your child likes, and enough for other kids too. This isn't a competition to see who provides the best. It's a healthy snack that doesn't have to be the same boring fruits and veggies every time.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly they are getting the fruit for free at daycare, and you are providing the children free fruit. They could possibly ask you about the fruit and where is the best place to get them or any advise to find affordable ones. You don't control other people's kids and what they want and don't want. And beyond fruit there are going to be times where kids will see something they want but can't have for whatever reason, and parents can't go around telling people to hide everything so their child/children won't ask for them.Also that mum will pretty much end up stopping the kids from getting the FREE fruit they want if she wants you to stop bringing them in. She's concerned about parents not being able to provide those same fruits, so wants to prevent the kids from having an opportunity in getting those fruits?", "NTA but be careful with kiwis and pineapple, usually people who have a latex allergy also tend to be allergic to these two fruits, just an FYI.", "NTA You can't do anything without someone getting offended about it.", "NTA. People will find anything to complain about.", "NTA parent politics and insecurity", "NTA  You are exposing the kids to foods that they don't normally eat and that's awesome! In turn your kid is eating food that they don't normally eat.  \nTell her that you will quit bringing \"expensive\" fruit as soon as she quits bringing boring fruit.", "NTA\n\nThe jealousy of some people thinking they can dictate what others do and do not donate to a communal food fund. my gods.", "NTA.\n\nKids at that age are more likely to try unusual foods.  I was shocked when my son's Montessori teacher had us bring olives and cream cheese to make a spread for crackers.  But she said if kids make it, they'll at least try it.\n\nYou are broadening their palates and this is a GOOD thing.  Mom can avoid those stands at the grocers, and kids won't know to ask for persimmons by name.", "NTA how dare those other mothers expect you to deprive your daughter (and their kids) because they don't want to be pressured to buy the same things for their own kids.", "NTA.

With that kind of reasoning one would never attempt to splurge to provide a child with infrequent experiences like going to a ballet or dance performance or the zoo.\n\nI realize that prices vary but in the USA none of these fruits are considered to be expensive - at least in season. Pineapples are in season all year long. Persimmons seem to be in season more in the Fall at least where I am and kiwi is also available all year long. \n\nI wouldn't call these \"expensive\" so much as not as common but everything is relative. My grandmother was a child in Europe prior to WW II and oranges were exotic and expensive and rare and she still remembers when her grandmother tracked down an orange as a present for her.", "NTA.

I have a toddler and while he\u2019s not in daycare, if he was, I\u2019d be happy that a parent was so generous that they brought uncommon, and often expensive, fruit as a treat for the kiddos. \n\nNot only would he get to try new things and expand his taste, I\u2019d also get to find out if he likes this pricey fruit so I could get him some as a treat when I can.", "NTA\n\nThis just highlights how no one can do anything right anymore\u2026complaining about fruit?!?

For a birthday, some kid took those tiny whole food cakes that are like $2 for a bite for school. The kid loved them, but I am not about to go to pay that at whole foods for a bite of cake.\n\nNow if it's a fruit that is just stupid expensive for some reason. I will buy it once and awhile as a special treat.

I still remember when I was in preschool one of the moms ran a bakery. When it was her turn for snacks she would bring in the most amazing cinnamon bread I've ever had in my life. I was 3 years old and I still remember that. I also remember my mom being really impressed because we were poor and I got to have some fancy ass snacks. We saw as a huge benefit and it was something we talked about for years afterward.\n\nI think the difference is my mom was a socialist. She didn't have any guilt over being not having money; she worked hard and spent the money that we had wisely, but she didn't have any internalized sense that poor people are morally inferior.
