To save money my fianc\u00e9 suggested sharing one car as I didn\u2019t need to go to the office each day. I was reluctant as I knew that when we both needed the car this would be an issue. He promised it wouldn\u2019t be and I would have priority as it\u2019s my car. (We kept the car that\u2019s in my name).\nWe live in a village around 10miles outside of town with an unreliable bus route. \nHe uses the car to go from and to work Monday - Friday. I pay half for the finance, tax and any repairs. I pay the insurance for both of us and top up the petrol when I do use the car. \nI needed the car today to deal with family stuff (Saturday), I told him about this a month ago and reminded him every week that I had plans and needed the car. I reminded him on Thursday and confirmed the time I\u2019d be out. \nLate last night (Friday) he announced that he agreed to go to work and would be taking the car at the exact time I needed it. He wasn\u2019t willing to come up with any suggestions and insisted that it\u2019s my problem and I need to just make other arrangements.  \nHe needed the car 9:30 - 12. I needed it 10-5pm. He works 1 hour away from where we live and I needed to go in the other direction and pick up people on my way.\nThis led to a huge argument as he said - work comes first. (Which I don\u2019t completely disagree with). \nMy view was that I gave plenty of notice (a month), I pay half, barely use the car and it\u2019s not just inconveniencing me but my whole family. He could have just told his boss that we car share and he couldn\u2019t go in at the time as he wouldn\u2019t have the car. He\u2019s not contacted for Saturdays and it was less than 12 hours notice. When my work ask me to go to the office on a weekday I explain that I don\u2019t have the car on short notice but I will get a taxi if it\u2019s urgent (I don\u2019t tell my fianc\u00e9 when this happens as I know he needs the car for work).\nHe said I was trying to just make him feel guilty for agreeing to work.\nAITA for being angry at him for taking the car?", "created_utc": 1682807204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1338l3x/aita_for_wanting_to_use_my_own_car/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please think long and hard about what he is doing. \n\nHe forces you to only keep one car. You keep yours, you bately use it and yet have the bigger chunk of expenses. He tells you you will always have the priority over it. The minute you need it he makes sure to book other plans and BLAMES YOU for it. Imagine now if you had a kid with this man. Time to have a long conversation wit him, and to go back to two cars if needed, or two houses.", "NTA. He sold his car and has now taken over your car. And, you are paying the lion\u2018s share of the expenses for it. He successfully created a situation where he gets his way and you pay the price. Is he like this in other aspects of your relationship?", "No, he's entirely in the wrong. You reminded him repeatedly. He should have told work he needed a ride or he was unavailable. NTA.", "NTA.  \n\nFirst of all, you cleared everything way ahead of time. \n\nSecondly, that\u2019s your car. If it was me, I would have called the police and told them my car was stolen. \n\nThird, he could have arranged for an Uber or ride share", "NTA.\n\nUm, don\u2019t y\u2019all use cars for travel other than work? I don\u2019t get why his reason for sharing a car is strictly just work. I personally think it wasn\u2019t a good idea to share a car.\n\nThat being said, you reminded him about needing the car for this family event every week until the event and he decided to accept hours on the time you need the car. This is why sharing a car would end badly", "NTA\n\nOK, is there more to the story as far as dividing finances? \n\nWhy are you paying the majority of the vehicle expenses for a car that is largely unavailable to you?\n\nWhere is the money going from all these saved expenses of him not having his own vehicle?\n\nSounds like he needs to get his own car again.", "If its my car, then he's the one who needs to make arrangements. Frankly, I can see that the savings made sense. But, his attitude doesn't. If I pay half then I expect at a bare minimum half the usage. \n\nNTA. He's being unreasonable and selfish. If he wants the car available to him at will, then he should pay for the financing, the insurance costs and the gas.", "INFO: why do you pay the insurance for both of you? Seems unfair", "NTA, time to have the conversation that it is your car and he needs to figure out an alternative when you need. Whether that is uber/taxi or buying himself a new car.", "NTA. He knew you needed it, waited until late Friday night to mention he volunteered to go into work and could have arranged other methods to get to work that day. He sounds kind of narcissistic the way he's handled the car situation as a whole.", "NTA. Tell him you\u2019re taking your car back and he needs to find himself a new car. What a jerk!", "NTA, but your Fiancee is.  What happened to you having priority?  Did he plan this last minute needing to work on the day that you needed the car?\n\nI would have a talk with him that he needs to get a car, or take alternative transport when he does this last minute stuff when you even reminded him on Thursday that you needed your car on Saturday.  The work bit is BS.", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like he's gotten very comfortable with the routine and no longer sees it as \"your\" car, but both of yours, and is now taking it for granted and has forgotten the kindness you showed him by allowing him to cut costs with eliminating one car to pay on. And now he's gaslighting you and the inconsideration he's showing you by saying you're \"trying to make him feel guilty for agreeing to go to work\". No, you're angry he disrespected your plans, is disrespecting the agreement you have had for an extended period of time now, and angry that he's also trying to disregard it and push it under the rug by trumping the importance of what you have going on because it won't be making money. Doesn't matter, he knew what he was doing.", "NTA and by a long shot.\n\nNot to be \u201cthat guy\u201d lol\u2026. But it sounds like you deserve better that someone willing to inconvenience without any concern for you.", "Boyfriend\u2019s an asshole, it\u2019s your car (for which you pay too much considering how infrequently you use it). Tell his MF ass to get a taxi. Better yet trade him up for a better partner.", "NTA-but you should rethink your relationship", "NTA\n\nIt's your car. He promised you car priority. He knew you needed it. He took it anyway. That shows he believes you are less important than he is. And it proves he lies and is undependable.\n\nHe has gaslighted you in this situation.  He has put loads of extra wear and tear plus mileage on your car, which devalues it. He has caused you to spend cash on taxis. \n\nNow you decide to let him keep sharing or take away car use. \n\nNow decide before the wedding if you are okay marrying a man that lies, takes advantage of you, and manipulates situations.  Can you trust him?", "NTA", "NTA your car your rules, you should call off the wedding", "NAH if it\u2019s a one off he can surely arrange a taxi / Uber just like you would if called in unexpectedly during the week?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stop making any payments whatsoever and get your own car again.  You're being scammed and isolated.", "NTA but you need to end this relationship- he literally got rid of his car and took over yours.
