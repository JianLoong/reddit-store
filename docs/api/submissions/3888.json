You're actually well within your rights to deviate from the estimate by a fairly large amount, depending on each state's law, without written approval.  If you charge a customer $90 instead of $45 then that customer has to pay.  It being fair or not doesn't matter, because it is legal.

Instead, if a business tries to sell a customer a $90 cake they can just not buy the cake if they think it's only worth $45.  But they cannot take the cake and leave the baker with $45.

They might not make money or break even but how can they lose money since the first cake would have been priced more than the ingredients cost.

I say this as someone who has make things for other people for a living for about 15 years.

It's a form of fraud. \n\nIf a mechanic does unauthorized work on my car and tries to charge me for it without asking for permission first I don't owe them anything more than what I agreed to entering into it. It's up to the contractor you've hired to make pricing clear before the purchase. They can give an estimate of between $x and $y amounts, but if they want to charge more than that $y amount for any reason without clearing it with you prior you don't actually owe them more. At that point they can let you take it for the originally agreed-upon price or restore things to how they were but good luck un-fixing a vehicle. My dad was a professional mechanic and he had to routinely explain this concept to new guys in the shop that they had to communicate any extra problems and potential charges with the clients prior to fixing something or else the customer didn't have to pay for the parts and labor for the extra issues. \n\nSame thing for computer repairs. If you bring a computer in for a diagnostic and they fix it without telling you prior then you owe them for the diagnostic - not for the fix itself. I have a friend whose father had that happen to him and he told them to put it back to how it was since he didn't agree to have them fix the issue - he agreed to have them diagnose it.

The waiter brings a well done sirloin with a loaded baked potato. They request the manager and ask to get what they ordered, even though there was a mistake in the kitchen.
