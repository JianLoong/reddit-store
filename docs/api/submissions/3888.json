She was informed of the higher price and the 1 day delay prior to picking up the cake.\n\nThe final price was $25 more, if she doesn't like the price then buy a different cake.  \n\nTaking the cake and refusing to pay the stated price simply wouldn't happen in a real bakery.  It'd go into the garbage and the customer would go looking for other cakes.", "Who the fuck calls a best buy? Apps and websites exist. \n\nYour comment also has nothing to do with the situation.", "There is no such thing called an estimate. Danielle\u2019s business has fixed prices not estimated ones. If she truly didn\u2019t know how much the cake would cost she could have given a range, not say the price is X prior to making the cake. I don\u2019t think you understand the OP\u2019s post or know how the real world works, unless you\u2019re ok with scams (that best buy example was so weird and out of touch)."]}
