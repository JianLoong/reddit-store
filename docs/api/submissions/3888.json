My friend tells me I actually owe Danielle $25 more than the agreed upon amount.\n\nI ask why, and she tells me about Danielle dropping the cake and having to buy new ingredients and spend more time. I tell her I understand that accidents happen and do feel bad for Danielle, but it is not my fault that Danielle dropped the cake and I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for the extra ingredients or time, just as I wouldn\u2019t have to for any other bakery. I\u2019d pay what we had originally agreed upon and that was it. I already had to pick up the cake a day later and rush to get it to my sons party because it had to be remade, which I was very nice and understanding about, because accidents happen. My friend is calling me an AH because at the end of the day, Danielle is still a teenager and lost money and time as a result. I told my friend the real world isn\u2019t perfect and things happen, and that if she felt strongly about it she should pay her daughter for the extra ingredients and I\u2019d pay for the cake as planned.

No. If you own a business and you screw up the item, you pay for the extra ingredients and eat the cost.\n\nShe\u2019s almost 18, and I wouldn\u2019t have paid either.

Also, for any mistakes, accidents that happen on the business side, those should be absorbed. You even have to consider when it is the customer's mistake if you want to remake something.You're taking a short loss with the hope of return customers. \n\nDanielle needs to learn the difficulties of business.  Propping it up by making friends, family pay for accidents, mistakes will burn and wear thin quickly.

You don't get paid until product is in the customer's hands.", "well the generous thing to do for a family friend would be to give her the extra $25 but you are by absolutely no means TA for sticking to the agreement.

But then the countertop was accidentally dropped prior to installing and was unusable. Would your friend be willing to pay out an extra $5000 for buying a new slab, the labor to cut it and extra time for the employees? I don't think so. Part of having a business is eating your mistakes, pun intended.", "NTA - This is no different than if she had burned the cake, or mixed in too many eggs, or any other number of mistakes that would have required remaking it. The price that she charges should account for the occasional mistake. It might mean that she won't make a profit on the occasional customer if she makes a mistake, but the profit that she makes from the other customers will help make up for that.\n\nIf she were making you a cake as a favor and simply doing it for you at cost, that would be one thing.

Are you shure it's a friend?", "She should also slightly increase her price so that mistakes like this become less financially burdensome in the long run.", "To be fair to Danielle, it's very possible she's okay with eating the cost and it's her mom who is trying to get OP to pay for it", ">And you, a friend of the mother, are not willing to pay 25$\n\nNot willing to pay EXTRA to make up for the mistake. Her mother- Op's friend should use this to teach her own child carefulness and that not everyone can afford EXTRA due to something called budgeting.", "This right here is the important business lesson.

I would still hire someone who made a mistake like this for future events, but I wouldn't go back to someone whose mother  was heckling me for more money and sending insults my way. It's really bad for business, and at this point, she most likely relies a lot on good word of mouth and loyal customers. She needs to address this with her mum before her mother loses her any customer's that aren't as understanding as you have been.", "I think you need to remind the mother/ your friend of other scenarios like this but that give examples that sound wild \n\nSo Starbucks, they mess up my order and I should pay for a second drink to have it fixed?
