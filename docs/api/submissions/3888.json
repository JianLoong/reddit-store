I tell her I understand that accidents happen and do feel bad for Danielle, but it is not my fault that Danielle dropped the cake and I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for the extra ingredients or time, just as I wouldn\u2019t have to for any other bakery. I\u2019d pay what we had originally agreed upon and that was it. I already had to pick up the cake a day later and rush to get it to my sons party because it had to be remade, which I was very nice and understanding about, because accidents happen. My friend is calling me an AH because at the end of the day, Danielle is still a teenager and lost money and time as a result. I told my friend the real world isn\u2019t perfect and things happen, and that if she felt strongly about it she should pay her daughter for the extra ingredients and I\u2019d pay for the cake as planned.

They absolutely should not pass that extra cost for their mistake down to the end consumer/customer.", "NTA.. if she was an adult and owned a bakery, she would have to pay for her mistake. It\u2019s a lesson learned!", "NTA. This is how business works. It would be different if you\u2019d been given a discount but if you paid her normal price then too bad", "NTA. If she charges you the same amount she'd charge anyone else, you should get the same customer experience.", "Nta, people make mistakes and have to take responsibilities. Although it would be gracious to pay extra 25 dollars just because she is your friend's daughter its totally optional and you are not obligated to do so. She also caused inconvenience to you by providing cake one day later and if she was pro baker she would probably end up losing money and reputation due to breach of deadlines.", "That\u2019s wild your friend is making you pay the extra charges, why cant she cover the costs for her daughters mistake??", "NTA - if her mom wants to build her motivation by paying for the ingredients, that's up to her. It's not your responsibility to help subsidize her new business. It's not like she's a little kid with a lemonade stand!", "That\u2019s terrible business on this kid\u2019s part. I understand that she dropped the cake, but that\u2019s the whole issue in the nutshell- she dropped it. If she opens an actual bakery and she ends up dropping someone\u2019s baked goods, is she going to charge her customers for ingredients she ended up wasting due to an accident that was her fault? No. If you own a business and you screw up the item, you pay for the extra ingredients and eat the cost.\n\nShe\u2019s almost 18, and I wouldn\u2019t have paid either. If she was much younger, I might have, but if this girl plans to turn this into business into something more serious, she will have to deal with losses that result from her own mistakes. That\u2019s just a part of life. She can\u2019t punish her customers for it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

That\u2019s not how this works and it won\u2019t serve Danielle to think that it is.", "NTA for your reasoning. You paid money for one cake. You should not have to pay for 2 cakes to get one cake. This is also why it's best to go with a professional (whom you aren't close with) in situations where you need something by a certain time.", "NTA. Part of running a business is coping with losses. It\u2019s a valuable lesson. Paying more would give this girl unrealistic expectations of the world. She dropped the cake. You did not. That\u2019s the way the cookie, or cake, crumbles.", "NTA and your friend is sabotaging her daughter\u2019s business because that\u2019s not how the world works. Your friend should be guiding her daughter to be professional\u2014which includes responsibility for her own mistakes.

If you lose your friendship over this ridiculous demand, then she really wasn't your friend to begin with.", "NTA", "Was the price originally done through Danielle or her mother? I think you're NTA either way, I'm just curious as to why the mother is the one saying you owe more. Maybe it isn't even Danielle's idea.", "Nta. It sucks for her, but that is part of doing business. I'm glad she followed through with repurchasing things and remaking it.", "NTA - I baked for friends and family all the time as a teen. I made many mistakes and had to remake many, many items. I would never ask a paying customer to pay for my mistake. \n\nThe daughter needs to learn that even no-fault situations come with consequences, especially if she's trying to make a proper business out of this.  Your friend needs to let her daughter learn. Although I do wonder if the demands are coming from the daughter via your friend or if they're just coming from your friend...?", "Nta. \n\nThere the joke of how to make a million dollars in the restaurant business. Start off with 2 million. \n\nUnfortunately,  service industry is time intensive , hands on, and if you don't work, produce, you don't get paid. Also, for any mistakes, accidents that happen on the business side, those should be absorbed. You even have to consider when it is the customer's mistake if you want to remake something.You're taking a short loss with the hope of return customers. \n\nDanielle needs to learn the difficulties of business.  Propping it up by making friends, family pay for accidents, mistakes will burn and wear thin quickly. Customers with no linkage would easily walk away and negatively review.", "Nta", "Your friend has a lot to say lol. I'm guessing they don't own a business. \n\nNTA for the reasons you've already stated.", "NTA. It\u2019s part of her learning, accidents happen and she needs to budget accordingly.", "NTA \n\nHowever, I have to ask, how much did she charge for this cake where she\u2019s losing money from having to remake it???", "NTA \n\nShe is learning great business lessons!", "NAH.  You\u2019re right about the cost.  But, is the cost sufficient to grenade this friendship,", "Imma go against the grain.. Kinda TA\n\nYou want to uphold the rules of business.. buy from a legal business.\nThis is a friends child\nYou could have offered a small amount to help.. a tip.\n\nSounds like the childbhas no margin here.. and is doing it for the experience of it.

In business, sometimes you make money, sometimes you lose money and sometimes you just break even. That\u2019s the reality and if your friend\u2019s daughter is going to have a business she needs to learn that. I have never heard of a business charging a customer for the cost of a mistake the business made.\n\nAlso you already showed Danielle grace by allowing her to make a second cake instead of canceling the order and ordering another cake from someone else. I know a lot of people who wouldn\u2019t have done that. At least she was able to make some money off of this job even if she didn\u2019t break even.", "NTA, that\u2019s the cost of doing business", "NTA at the end of the day, everyone has to realise that mistakes happen but you\u2019ll always have to pay for your own problems.", "NTA.

I actually don\u2019t think she has anything to do with this. She was upset about ruining the first cake and very apologetic (which I told her I completely understand that accidents happen and am not upset with her), but I think my friend is asking for this to make her feel better.", "Ops friend is messing up the friendship. You don\u2019t ask your friend to pay for your kids mistake", "If someone wants to end a friendship with me over $25 when they are clearly in the wrong, that would be just fine with me because they weren\u2019t a real friend anyway.", "A deal is a deal. OP was already inconvenienced by Danielle\u2019s mistake because she had to pick up the cake a day later. Why should OP shoulder the entire burden of Danielle\u2019s mistake? Put the rules of business to the side for a second. What about morals? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s morally wrong to make someone else absorb the cost of a mistake you made?", "Key word: business. In business you don\u2019t make your customer absorb the costs of your mistakes. OP gave Danielle a huge break when they let her make a new cake after the first one fell on the floor. I know people who would have been so frustrated that they would have canceled the order and order a cake from a professional bakery.", "If OP was willing to pay twice the cost, she would have gone to a professional baker.", "So what? A deal is a deal. OP agreed to pay a certain price for the cake. She never agreed to reimburse Danielle for the costs of any mistakes she might make during the baking process.", "She\u2019s also baking out of her own kitchen so doesn\u2019t have regular business expenses like a permits, etc. OP is getting a discount but also a cake not produced according to local heath regulations. OP is already taking risk\u2014she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for this kid\u2019s mistakes", "Well soon-to-be-ex friend did.  While OP is absolutely in the right, the question must be asked, is the friendship worth $25 bucks, cause this clearly will be the end of it."]}
