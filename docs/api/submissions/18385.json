That said, you have no business interfering with her marriage. Given Lisa's concerns, you have no business meeting up with, or talking with her husband without her. If you have your own IT company, I'm sure you can find a different sounding board for your professional ideas. You don't need Mike for that, so it's somethng else that's keeping you hanging on to him. Maybe Lisa has correct intuition about feelings you may be in denial of, either regarding her or her husband.

Lisa's unpredictability is something I remember well from our childhood, maybe it's time I take that into account and put some distance between Mike and me for her sake.", "Thanks for your support. It's been difficult trying not to internalize Lisa's issues, and I appreciate the reminder that her problems are not mine. The open door idea is a good one, I still hope for a resolution someday.", "Appreciate the support! It's a tough spot to be in. Growing up, Lisa and I always had such different perspectives, but I never thought it would lead to this kind of accusation.", "Your words hit home. I don't want to cause strain or give Lisa an excuse to blame me for her problems. Our parents are going through a tough time health-wise (age-related, I didn\u2019t really want to go into specifics) and I realize I need to handle this situation more delicately.", "Woah there, hold on a minute. I think you're jumping to some heavy conclusions. Mike and I are friends, period. He's an honorable guy who's always been supportive and respectful to everyone in our family, and the idea of him being unfaithful to Lisa is honestly laughable. Our common ground is tech and business, not romance.\n\n\n And as for Lisa, it's not like I've cut her off without reason. Her accusations and actions lately have been off the rails. You think I should just smile and take that? Maybe you don't know the full story, but let's just say it's more complicated than you make it out to be.", "I get where you're coming from. I want to make clear though that there's nothing romantic between Mike and me - our chats are mostly geeking out over tech stuff. \n\nI've thought about family counseling with Lisa too, it might be a good way to bring some peace back into the family.", "Also for your sake you need to distance yourself from whole thing.", "[deleted]", "I can only imagine.  My siblings and I all went off into wildly different directions all across the country.  We keep in touch but (low whistle) if any one of us acted up like Lisa the rest would come down like a ton of bricks because accusations like that would not only be laughable, but a sign of a serious problem on the part of the accuser.\n\nI'm sorry your traditional family is indulging their 'othering' of you in such a hateful manner, to even entertain the thoughts are mind boggling to me.  Will Mike be able to get her in for a checkup?  It sounds like she needs it.", "I am glad that I could help. Best of luck to you.", "Why on earth would I expect you to \"just smile and take that\"?\n\nI expect you to communicate with your friend's wife in order to not add ridiculous amounts of stress to his life as well as your parents' lives.  Your sister is \"off the rails\" but you neither like nor respect her enough to try to get her help or to address her very serious concerns directly.  I don't expect you to care about your sister, because you don't.\n\nIf her husband is still seeing you and talking to you after her very publicly accusing both of you of an affair, then it's pretty *obvious* he does prioritize his relationship with you over his relationship with her.  And frankly? You post makes it look like you enjoy that.\n\nI would expect an ethical person to take her accusations very seriously and immediately address them with her.  The first time she accused her husband of preferring you or you of encouraging that should have been when you addressed it.  I would NOT be meeting with my sister's partner alone after a comment like that, forget about waiting until it escalated into a public shaming or *still* seeing him and having private conversations with him while actively excluding her.\n\nYou admit you think you might be TA because you want to spite her while also saying all of your behavior is okay because she joined an MLM?", "I already got that there's nothing \"romantic\" between you, and I'm telling you that people frequently hide their own motivations from themselves, and you may not be aware of all of yours. How about individual therapy for you too? You need it.", "Well, it\u2019s family. I\u2019d like to maintain my relationships with my niece and nephew. I am planning on stepping back until this blow over, however. Other than going to my niece\u2019s birthday party early next month, I\u2019ll be staying away.", "> I think your BIL is bonding with you not just professionally because he's realizing just how vulnerable the marital finances are. Not only will your sister not admit she's been duped by a scam, she's attacking your character at the same time because she is desperate for downlines and needs to distract from her lack of success. And since she has to \"fake it to make it\" she's probably spending more on not just the MLM but the appearances to seem as if she's successful in it.\nThe \"trad wife\" thing may not have phased him but perhaps he's realizing with her holding her staunch positions in regards to the MLM that he may be in for more than he bargained for with his wife.\n\n\nThanks for your perspective. \n\n\nI've definitely wondered if Mike is reaching out more because he's starting to see the financial pitfall that Lisa's MLM involvement could lead to. Growing up, Lisa was always stubborn and once she latched onto an idea, she wouldn't let go, even if it wasn't good for her. I suppose this MLM thing is just the adult version of that. \n\n\nThe \"trad wife\" aspect might be contributing too, but that's a whole different can of worms. I really do hope Mike can help her see sense before things get even worse.", "You hit the nail on the head, and thanks for getting it. Our family is... well, complex, like any other I guess. Lisa and I couldn't be more different if we tried, and I've always tried to respect her choices. It's just that now those choices involve me in a way I never expected. \n\n\n\nAs for Mike, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place - his wife and his old friend. He's doing what he can, though. Thanks for backing me up, it really does help.", "Sorry if I made it seem like I thought being TA was okay just because Lisa joined an MLM. That's not the case. Lisa's involvement in the MLM is a separate issue and, while it has caused some friction, it's not the root of the problem here.\n\n\n\nWhat's been bothering me is not the MLM itself, but Lisa's shift in behavior and attitude since she joined it. Her accusations came out of nowhere, and I've been struggling to reconcile this version of Lisa with the sister I used to know. That's led to some feelings of frustration and yes, maybe even spite, which I realize isn't productive or fair.\n\n\n\nBut spite isn't what's driving my actions. It's more about trying to preserve my relationship with Mike, a friend I've known and respected long before he became my brother-in-law, and trying to navigate this situation in a way that causes the least harm to everyone involved.\n\n\n\nI understand that you think I should have distanced myself from Mike the moment Lisa voiced her concerns, and in retrospect, you might be right. It's a tricky balance between preserving an innocent friendship and respecting my sister's feelings, and maybe I've erred on the wrong side. I'll take your points on board and consider how I can better handle this situation moving forward. Thanks for calling me out.", "Look, I get where you're coming from, but I'm not denying any feelings here. \n\n\n\nLet me share something about Mike and me. We were college friends before he ever met Lisa. We've shared long nights working on projects, brainstorming ideas, and troubleshooting together. It\u2019s a bond that has always been about mutual respect and collaboration, not romance. So, when you suggest that I'm unaware of my own motivations, it feels like you're dismissing that history. That said, I understand your points, and they've given me some food for thought. I am not opposed to counseling, and maybe individual therapy might indeed help me navigate this complicated situation better. \n\n\n\nThanks for your input.", "Bad idea.\nJust send a gift and talk on the phone and don't go to there home.\nYour sister has already humiliated you once, you don't know what will happen at your niece's birthday party, it would be a shame if your niece's birthday party was disrupted.", "Glad to help, if you want someone to talk to, feel free to message me or just comment here (I will see it).    \n\n\nYou're going to have to think about taking space from the two of them though, Lisa for obvious reasons, and Mike because you cannot continue to paint a target on your own back when dealing with the type of crazy Lisa is capable of.", "There should be no rock and hard place here for Mike. She is his wife. She also sounds like she needs some serious help. Bow out gracefully if only so you don't make his life worse.", "You say it\u2019s an innocent friendship, but it\u2019s not as innocent as you\u2019re trying to act like it is if internet strangers are sensing that there\u2019s an emotional relationship there. Especially when you\u2019ve posted this to make you seem as blameless as possible.", "The problem is that the friendship stopped being innocent the moment your sister expressed her concerns and neither you nor her husband changed your behaviors.  Her accusations absolutely did *not* come out of nowhere, even if you want to pretend they did.  Those sorts of concerns in a marriage are *not* something you can brush off unless you really do consider your friendship with him to be more important than his *marriage* to her.\n\nEven in your own story she began voicing her discomfort and made repeated statements that became much stronger statements over time.\n\nI would have serious side eye for any dude who heard his wife's concerns and didn't do anything differently.  My husband would have taken any such comment about him preferring someone as a \"record scratch\" stop-everything, serious discussion time moment.  Forget anything reaching the point of an accusation.\n\nI don't doubt your sister is acting erratically.  Many people do not handle their spouse having an affair well at all. Their are two people in your friendship, and while your feelings might be platonic, his might not.  The fact that he is *still* talking to you without his wife after she exposed his actions as publicly as she could?  He is putting you over his marriage.  That's fucked up.\n\nAnd even now you are more concerned about preserving your relationship with your sister's husband than you are with making sure your sister believes that you haven't betrayed her.  That's why no one here believes there's anything innocent about your motives in this either.", "Nope. I was pretty much fine with whatever up until your response previous to this one. You do not respect your sister or her marriage and you are creating a palpable enough chaos effect that it reads gross to internet strangers. You do not have a good reason to maintain the connection with Mike.", "You didn't give me that hx until now. Don't be defensive. What came before is no longer relevant. Mike married your sister, not you. That changed your relationship with him forever, but you can't acknowledge that. The more you talk, the more I can see your emotional attachment to him. You need therapy. Mike and Lisa need therapy. And your whole family needs therapy together.", "You raise a valid concern. Maybe I could have a chat with Mike about this to assess the situation, and if it seems like it could get messy, I'll take your advice and celebrate with her at a later, more private date. \n\n\nThanks for the advice. It\u2019s a tough call, but the welfare of my niblings is my primary concern.", "Thank you. It\u2019s just hard because of my niblings\u2014it\u2019s important to me to maintain my relationship with my niece and nephew. Since I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to Lisa after her outburst, Mike is really the only one I have to go to. The kids don\u2019t have phones (personally, I agree that they\u2019re too young) and I have no other way of staying in contact with them or being able to coordinate plans.", "Woah, let\u2019s take it down a notch. What exactly do you think I\u2019m leaving out here? I\u2019m trying to get an honest judgment and I think I\u2019ve been receptive to everyone\u2019s questions in the comments. \n\n\nWhat Mike and I have has always been entirely platonic and I think the baseless accusations of a few people here have been ridiculous. That being said I\u2019ve been discussing everything openly. Again, what exactly do you think I\u2019m leaving out here?", "I understand where you're coming from, but I'm genuinely not trying to create chaos or harm my sister's marriage in any way. Mike and I have been friends since before he met Lisa, and our bond is based on shared professional interests and mutual respect, not romantic or emotional entanglement.\n\n\n\nHere's something about Mike that I haven't mentioned yet: when we were in college, he was dating another classmate of ours. She was absolutely infatuated with him, but Mike was upfront about not feeling the same way. Even so, he continued to be kind, supportive, and respectful towards her. When she confessed her love for him, he gently and directly told her that he didn't share her feelings and couldn't reciprocate. It was hard for her, but he handled it with such grace and honesty, and it allowed them to remain friends without crossing any lines.\n\n\n\nThat's the Mike I know. He's a stand-up guy who is faithful and respectful, not someone who would engage in an affair or even an emotional relationship outside his marriage.\n\n\n\nBut your comment is giving me pause to consider if, despite our best intentions, our friendship is being perceived as disrespectful to Lisa or harmful to their marriage. I've always thought our relationship was innocent, but I'll certainly take your feedback on board and consider how best to approach this moving forward. Thank you for sharing your perspective.", "Hey, I hear you. I know it may seem like I'm trying to defend myself because, well, I am. But it's not out of an attachment to Mike, it's out of an attachment to truth and clarity. I'm sorry if my previous responses weren't clear enough; writing these words on the internet sometimes loses a bit of nuance.\n\n\n\nYes, Mike and I have history, but like you said, he married my sister. And I respect that - he is her husband first and foremost, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I've striven to be mindful of that in all my interactions with him.\n\n\n\nAnd you know what, you're right about therapy. It's a good tool for introspection and understanding, and maybe I've been too defensive to see that. I'll take up your suggestion and consider individual therapy. As for Mike and Lisa, that's something I hope they would consider too, but that's up to them.\n\n\n\nAs for our whole family needing therapy together, I've been pondering that as well. It would be an ideal place to address all these complex dynamics and perhaps start the process of healing. Thanks again for your input.", "STOP TALKING TO MIKE. This is why you\u2019re in the situation to begin with", "If it\u2019s so platonic then why do you insist on continuing a relationship with him instead of stepping back to respect his marriage? I just saw a comment that you were going to talk to Mike about whether you should join your nieces birthday party or not. Stop talking to him! It\u2019s not that hard.", "Or don't stop talking to Mike. Talking to an opposite-gender person isn't in itself a behaviour married/partnered folk need to avoid and if the sister is deep in an MLM he might need some support as well. They're generally dodgy and people can get caught up in them in a cult-like way. \n\nOP if you don't know of it already, the  [r/antiMLM](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/) sub and various antiMLM YouTube channels might be of interest to you.", "Yes!", "My relationship with my niece and nephew is important to me.

Did you make a comment during her presentation or something? \n\nAlso, I don't understand why you even attended the MLM event if you're so against them. \n\nI'm trying not to read between the lines, but it seems odd to me that your sister would launch into a tirade against you during her business presentation.\n\nEDIT: JUDGMENT NTA\nI would keep communicating with Mike because I'd be worried about my sister's mental health, and would want to stay informed and try to help in any way possible.", "NTA", ">The MLM Lisa is involved with has some seriously questionable practices that remind me of true crime stories I've read about such organizations. It's one of those ones that you see on the news where the top 1% make all the money while the rest end up in debt.\n\nNTA - Honestly that is every MLM, there is no good ones. I think you do need to go LC with Mike for a while. Lisa may very well be torpedoing her marriage and it's probably better to do back a bit.", "Yeah, the MLM event was a mess. I was there to support Lisa despite my reservations about MLMs. Things went sideways when she got some heat about her business. She threw me under the bus, saying I was meddling in her marriage and sabotaging her work.\n\n\n\nHer remarks about me and Mike caught me off guard. Mike and I go way back, long before he met Lisa. We're tech nerds, that's our bond. Never crossed the line into anything else. Lisa spun it out of control at her presentation.\n\n\n\nThe whole ordeal has us on eggshells. Mike's been a rock but we're trying to avoid adding more fuel to the fire. We've sidelined our tech chats for now to keep the peace at family gatherings. It's rough, but we're trying to get through it without making things worse.", "Thank you.", "Thanks for understanding my situation and the concern with MLMs. It\u2019s hard to see Lisa being pulled into one, especially one with this kind of track record.\n\n\n\nI appreciate your advice about limiting contact with Mike for the time being. I have been considering this course of action as it might help cool down the situation. It's just difficult, given our long-standing friendship and the fact that he's basically my link to my niece and nephew right now. But you're right, it might be for the best to step back a bit until the situation stabilizes. Thank you.", "Exactly. If you\u2019re not gonna be in her life, and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to, stay out of her husband\u2019s life.", "Yeah I've read through all the comments and it's pretty clear that you and Mike are just friends. Who all was giving her heat during her presentation?", "Thanks.\n\n\nAt the presentation, there was a mix of friends, family, and people Lisa's met through the MLM. Some people were supportive, but a few of our family friends (an old business partner of my parents, one of my coworkers from a college internship Lisa and I both had, one of my friends who teaches at a business program nearby) had valid concerns. They were asking hard questions about the business model, the products, the income she was making. They weren't aggressive, just trying to make sense of it all.", "If you want deep meaningful relationships with young nibblings that means you need to have a relationship with both parents. They're the kids'parents and have the ultimate say in their kids'lives. You can reestablish a closer relationship when they become independent adults.", "Ok I see. Well, if you didn't chime in when the others were \"ganging up\" on Lisa, then you appear to be a completely innocent bystander in that dramatic mess. I can see it from Lisa's point of view too. Obviously she doesn't feel she's working in a scam company, so basically she feels like she's working really hard and everyone was basically making fun of her. Her throwing you under the bus, and all her escalating behavior... it kinda sounds like she's going off the deep end, and that is concerning. She also likely feels like you and Mike are ganging up on her because it's clear that neither of you support her business \"venture\". Look, I detest MLM schemes, so I am 100% with you and Mike on this. It's just that I can see how lisa must feel. She needs therapy to deal with whatever emotion is telling her that you and Mike have something going on. As for the judgement, I think you are NTA for continuing communication with Mike. I talk with my sibling's spouses, and their ex-spouses. Sometimes I've even kept communication with said spouses whilst being low-contact with my brothers. I will talk to whoever I want to (Obviously, as long as I'm not participating in extra-marital affairs or being malicious in some way). Hopefully your sister and Mike can sort out their issues. This seems to have nothing to do with you; but you've become the target.", "Yea that\u2019s what it\u2019s looking it honestly. If my sister accused me of messing with her husband I would definitely take a step back from the friendship for a while . It doesn\u2019t look good at all that OP willing to ignore her sis and not talk to her but continue to speak to her husband AFTER being accused of having a affair with him no matter how you slice it that does not look good on both OP and husband part got me side eyeing \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 both of them \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udd28", "Thanks for sharing your viewpoint, and I see where you're coming from. But let me provide some clarity and context. Mike and I, we have a decade-long history of being friends before he even met Lisa. We bonded over tech, our passion, and it has remained that way. It's a friendship that's focused on mutual respect and shared interests, not romantic feelings. And believe me, if there were even the tiniest hint of romantic feelings from either of us, I would've put an immediate stop to it because I respect both Mike and my sister.\n\n\n\nAnd regarding the situation after Lisa expressed her concerns - I didn't brush them off. Mike and I did not continue our private discussions or meet-ups without Lisa's knowledge or consent. I respected her feelings and understood the potential impact on their marriage. Yes, it was hard to believe her accusations because they were unfounded, but I still chose to put distance for their sake.\n\n\n\nNow, concerning Mike. If you knew him, you'd know that his loyalty to Lisa is unwavering. He's been trying to work things out with her, to alleviate her insecurities. He values his marriage far more than our friendship.\n\n\n\nLastly, about Lisa's feelings. They matter to me, more than you may think. It hurts to see her feel betrayed when all I have ever had for her is love and concern. Her public accusations were a shock, but I want to find a way to heal this rift. I am more focused on repairing my relationship with my sister than maintaining my friendship with Mike. I don't want anyone in my family to be in pain.\n\n\n\nAgain, I appreciate your viewpoint. I hope this provides a better understanding of where I'm coming from.", "I just wanted to say this is beautifully put. I hope OP actually reads this and takes it to heart.", "That's a very pretty story, but you're NC with your sister and still talking to Mike.  I can't see how you expect that to alleviate her concerns.  Announcing your meetups with her husband is unlikely to make her feel better about them if she's already expressed her concerns multiple times.\n\nAgain, I don't see where the depth of your relationship with Mike has importance here except that you use it as justification for a lot while in the same breath calling your sister's accusations irrational.", "It isn\u2019t inherently a behavior to avoid but if my sister was so uncomfortable with my friendship with her husband that she thought I was having an affair I\u2019d take a step back from that relationship until they sorted out their issues out of respect. \n\nOP won\u2019t do that bc it\u2019s clear she enjoy the attention from Mike and enjoys causing an issue in their marriage. It\u2019s gross.", "No, but you\u2019re definitely dramatic. You have options that don\u2019t involve continuing to disrespect your sisters marriage. \n\n1. Talk to your sister about your niece and nephew\n2. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable with that, use your parents as a go between for you and your sister or you and your niblings. \n3. STOP TALKING TO MIKE \n\nIt\u2019s obvious based on your replies you enjoy the attention from Mike and the drama it\u2019s causing in his marriage. You need a therapist asap.", "Stop acting like a victim, you\u2019re not a victim. I\u2019ll repeat what I told the above commenter because it\u2019s clear you need to hear it. \n\nIt isn\u2019t inherently a behavior to avoid but if my sister was so uncomfortable with my friendship with her husband that she thought I was having an affair I\u2019d take a step back from that relationship until they sorted out their issues out of respect.\n\nYou won\u2019t  do that bc it\u2019s clear you enjoy the attention from Mike and enjoys causing an issue in their marriage. It\u2019s gross.", "There's nothing in the post that gives me the impression OP is enjoying causing issues and is inappropriately into getting attention from Mike.\n\nIt comes across as two people who enjoy each other's company in an appropriate way that's not uncommon for inlaws.\n\nI get the impression that sister is wildly misinterpreting innocent behaviours, which is a sister issue, not an OP and Mike issue. It's also very possible that any kind of behaviour will be misinterpreted, so regardless of what OP and/Mike do sister will take issue.\n\nIt's not mentioned what MLM sister is into, but I've seen enough videos and posts about them to be aware of how weird and echo-chambery they can get. Often even slightly implying the MLM isn't the bestest thing in the world, never mind might be a straight up scam, is a good way of being unfriended/blocked/ignored for \"not being supportive\" of their shitty \"business\".", "Sis, is that you?", "Hold on, you're making some serious assumptions about my motivations here. I've been trying to communicate my side of the story, but it seems you're more intent on ascribing intentions to my actions that simply aren't there.\n\n\n\nThis isn't about me enjoying drama or attention. It's about my relationship with my niece and nephew, and my longstanding friendship with Mike, not some soap opera plot. I understand that Lisa's behavior has thrown a wrench into everything, but it doesn't change the fact that I have genuine relationships that I am trying to preserve.\n\n\n\nThe idea that I should stop talking to Mike entirely is unrealistic. He's been a friend of mine for years, even before he married my sister. I respect his marriage to Lisa, and I've never done anything to intentionally harm it. I never imagined that maintaining a friendship would be viewed as an attack on their relationship.\n\n\n\nHowever, I can see how some of my actions may have added fuel to the fire, and I am willing to make some changes. But implying that I'm some home wrecker enjoying the chaos is out of line. This situation is causing me a lot of pain, too. It's far from a situation anyone would enjoy.", "NTA Her behavior is bizarre. I do think you need to distance yourself from Mike some. I'm not saying end your friendship. Just back off a little because right or wrong (definitely wrong), your sister is upset by it. Be honest with Mike and let him know why you're backing off. Hopefully, this is temporary. He does need to figure out if his wife needs help and/or if they need to work on some issues, but at this time, you're not the appropriate person to discuss it with nor confide in. Sorry this happened. Your sister was deeply hurtful.", "NTA", "NTA for cutting off Lisa, but idk that it\u2019s wise to keep a close relationship with Mike.", "There are a lot of different businesses that can be folded into MLM- are we talking selling candles or Pampered Chef or are we talking a monetary investment in the next level of the business? As well, the fact that there were friends, family, AND people from the MLM suggests that this company is not a \u201cbuy a candle from your neighbor\u201d company and more of a financial investment. The professionals were brought in to help sell in a situation where the rest of the attendees were there to support their friend/family and generally be a nice person. They would have bought a candle but they\u2019re not pulling the IRA out and giving it to the MLM. \nThat\u2019s a lot of business pressure for your sister and those are some very good professional sales people. That\u2019s why they were there. Cut your sister some slack on the MLM front.\n\nBut OP, no one cares how long you and Mike have known each other or what level of friend you are. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is you are inserting yourself in between a husband and wife under the guise of \u201cjust wanting to help\u201d. And refusing to back down after being shown that. That\u2019s why YTA. And your niece and nephew aren\u2019t going to forget who you are if you step away for a bit.\n\nLeave Mike alone. YTA only for being the third person in a marriage.", "MLMs ARE SCAMS.  You are correct the about questionable practices.  They skirt the law.\n\nYour sister is probably jealous and angry that you are successful, she is no and she fell for a scam.\n\nI understand  your cutting contact with your sister.  I would also keep Mike at arm's length  for **your** own protection. Explain to him why this has to be done.  I would advise  Mike to lcut the financial strings with his wife, as she is just going to get into deeper debt.\n\nNTA.  I don't think this is going to end well for anyone.", "I'll be honest. You BIL sounds chill, but at the end of the day, he is your sister's husband. As an outsider to their marriage, I would just slowly stop talking to him. If it really comes down to something professional, he can figure it out later down the line. I just think you lose out the most in carrying this relationship.", "I appreciate your honesty.\n\n\n\nKeeping a relationship with Mike while tensions are high is definitely tricky. But cutting him off entirely feels wrong, too. He's been my friend for years, long before he and Lisa got together. I don't want to jeopardize that because of this mess. But I do agree, we need to figure out how to navigate this situation better to reduce the strain on everyone. Thanks for your perspective, it's given me something to consider.", "I see where you're coming from, but this isn't about inserting myself in between a husband and wife. I'm not clinging to Mike out of some misguided sense of loyalty. This is about making sure that the children, my niblings, aren't lost amidst this chaos that the MLM has catalyzed.\n\n\n\nThe MLM Lisa is involved in isn't the innocent 'buy a candle from your neighbor' variety. It's the kind that urges people to drain their life savings for promises of impossible returns. The pressure it has put on Lisa is enormous, I agree. But it's also been exacerbating some darker issues Lisa's grappled with in the past. It's hard to watch her fall prey to these schemes while dragging her family into it.\n\n\n\nBacking away might seem like the easy and sensible thing to do, but when it involves innocent kids and a sibling spiraling, it's not that simple.\n\n\n\nIt's not about being a third person in their marriage but about being a constant in those kids' lives and helping my sister, even when she's too clouded by this MLM scam to realize she needs it.", "I appreciate your understanding. I've always been against MLMs and it kills me to see Lisa get sucked into one. I fear you might be right about her feeling jealous. It was never my intention to make her feel inferior or anything. Our careers just took different paths, that's all.\n\n\n\nI've been careful about my relationship with Mike. We both understand the situation and we're trying to handle it without causing more trouble. As for your advice about Mike cutting financial strings, I'd like to hope it doesn't come to that. But I fear the debt is already mounting. It's a real mess.\n\n\n\nI hope for all our sakes, especially the kids, things turn around before it's too late. Thanks for your insight.", "You're angry with your sister, understandably.   Refusing to back off for a bit with Mike, sounds a tad like revenge. If you really want to be in the nibblings lives, you have to make a choice.  It doesn't matter how long you've known him, he is her husband.  They have issues to work out.  NTA yet but if you don't give a bit of space then E S H.", "You'd rather keep your friendship with Mike and then there is a divorce?  I'm seeing some sibling rivalry here.", "I get where you're coming from, but it's not as straightforward as that. I've been a constant presence in my niece and nephew's lives since they were born. Just because their mother has some unfounded suspicions, does that mean I should become a stranger to them? I don't believe that's fair to the kids or to me.\n\n\n\n\nMike, their father, is fully supportive of my relationship with the kids, and we've been mindful to keep our interactions appropriate and open. If anything, it feels like Lisa's the one complicating things here. I mean, I'm trying to be understanding, but it's hard when her accusations are so outlandish and baseless. I just hope we can find a resolution soon, for everyone's sake.", "Mike was friends with OP before he dated his wife. And isn't the usual advice to stay in a friend's life so the abuser doesn't manage to isolate the victim? IMO this wife crossed the line to emotional abuse...", "Babsie, I see where you're coming from, but this is more complicated than just a sibling rivalry. Yes, I do have a friendship with Mike, but that doesn't mean I value it more than my relationship with Lisa. \n\n\nThis isn't about me choosing Mike over Lisa. \n\n\nThis is about Lisa spiraling into a dark place, one we've unfortunately seen her go to before. Her obsession with her MLM and the paranoia she's displaying is reminiscent of a time in our past I'd hoped we'd left behind.\n\n\n\n My primary concern is the wellbeing of my niblings in this increasingly volatile environment. If a divorce were to happen, it would be Lisa's and Mike's decision, not mine. I'm just doing my best to keep things stable for the kids amidst all this chaos.", "Ok but you do realize Lisa does not like you. She literally thinks you're trying to seduce her husband. If you keep trying to be in her husband and kids' lives she will start poisoning the kids against you. If they divorce she will blame you and tell her kids that it was your fault.\n\nI agree with the other commenter that you need to step back and just be the aunt who sends a card and gift/money for Christmas and birthdays for the time being. Back off now while the kids still have good memories that aren't being filtered through the poison veil the their mother will eventually drape over them. If she successfully poisons them you won't be able to reestablish any sort of relationship when they're adults away from their mother.", "Then make the conversations as open and professional as possible, preferably with witnesses.", "The kids are not going to notice if you aren\u2019t around for 3 months. They are too self involved in their own lives, as kids are. Let things cool down for 3 months, don\u2019t communicate with Mike, lay low and let them sort their business out themselves.", "You're missing the point, Early-Tale. There's no affair. None. We're not playing lovebirds behind Lisa's back. The accusations are baseless, period. \n\n\n\nI've stepped back from Mike as much as possible, but we both give a damn about those kids. We're walking on a tightrope here, trying to balance the well-being of the kids with Lisa's paranoia. So, before you start side-eyeing us, maybe consider that we're trying to manage a mess that we didn't even create.", "I appreciate your advice, but I can't simply distance myself for three months. Those kids aren't just 'self-involved', they're at an age where they're highly aware and sensitive to their surroundings. They've started noticing the tensions and they've come to me for reassurance more than once. \n\n\nIt's heart-wrenching. Their world is unstable right now and I don't want to be another adult who suddenly disappears from their life. I'm not trying to interfere with Lisa and Mike's issues. I'm just trying to provide some stability for my niblings in this tumultuous time.", "I\u2019m side eyeing you even harder now \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 . Clearly you and the husbands actions has got your sister believing y\u2019all are messing around . Your comments about your sister shows you don\u2019t like her at all and you don\u2019t respect her . If you care about the kids why is it so hard for you to back off and give them space until the sister and husband can work out their differences in their marriage?? Why do you HAVE to communicate with mike why not have another relative check up on the kids ? Your sister full on believes there is something going on and you not being willing to stop talking to mike for a while is proving whatever delusion you say she has right which makes me and anyone else in the Reddit question things and if you don\u2019t like being question then delete this post then .", "Well continuing with Mike will likely cause a divorce and what is the likelihood you'll see them after that?", "The last thing I want is for my relationship with Mike to cause more trouble for their marriage. The thought of a divorce over this is heartbreaking, not just for them but for the kids as well. That said, it's crucial to clarify that Mike and I are just friends. Any implication or suggestion of an affair is baseless and not true. I'll take your advice into consideration, though, and think about how to better manage this situation for everyone involved.", "NTA", "ESH. Your sister was out of line but this reads like you're continuing the relationship with your BiL in order to cause problems. You haven't had an affair or done anything untoward, but continuing to talk to him now implies otherwise. Most people would back off in this case, at least until they've worked it out. If you respect your BiL so much then you should respect his marriage and back off.", "So, to recap...  \n\nYou chose a career in tech, and your sister chose to be a SAHM.  \nYour BIL also works in tech, and you two have bonded over this.  \nYour sister had a mental breakdown at one of her parties and accused you of trying to seduce her husband.  \nYour sister has had outbursts since she was little.  \nYour parents being sick gets mentioned like twice, so I'm not even sure how that's super relevant to the post. Other than that's your only motivation to fix things? \nYou have a weirdly obsessive focal point on MLMs when it literally has *nothing* to do with your narrative other than making your sister look ignorant and stupid.  \nSo instead of backing off, letting your sister cool down, and letting Mike know if things get worse, you're there; your solution is to... keep doing what you're doing?  \nIf Mike isn't happy in his marriage, that's on *him* to fix. Not you.  \nAlso, despite being the super cool aunt who has been there \"since the kids were born,\" you're ignoring a very important piece of information, which is, they aren't your kids.  \nAnd if they are as smart as you say they are, you could have an age appropriate conversation with them.  \nYou could tell Mike to Google a good divorce lawyer.  \nAll of these would be preferable to you adding fuel to the fire.  \n\nYour sister needs to get on meds and go to therapy if she can't control herself.  \nMike needs to figure himself the fuck out and make a decision about what he wants to do. Because right now, he's using you as an emotional support animal and playing happy family with his wife.
