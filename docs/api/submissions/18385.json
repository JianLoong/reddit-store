That said, you have no business interfering with her marriage. Given Lisa's concerns, you have no business meeting up with, or talking with her husband without her. If you have your own IT company, I'm sure you can find a different sounding board for your professional ideas. You don't need Mike for that, so it's somethng else that's keeping you hanging on to him. Maybe Lisa has correct intuition about feelings you may be in denial of, either regarding her or her husband.

Lisa's unpredictability is something I remember well from our childhood, maybe it's time I take that into account and put some distance between Mike and me for her sake.", "Thanks for your support. It's been difficult trying not to internalize Lisa's issues, and I appreciate the reminder that her problems are not mine. The open door idea is a good one, I still hope for a resolution someday.", "Appreciate the support! It's a tough spot to be in. Growing up, Lisa and I always had such different perspectives, but I never thought it would lead to this kind of accusation.", "Your words hit home. I don't want to cause strain or give Lisa an excuse to blame me for her problems. Our parents are going through a tough time health-wise (age-related, I didn\u2019t really want to go into specifics) and I realize I need to handle this situation more delicately.", "Woah there, hold on a minute. I think you're jumping to some heavy conclusions. Mike and I are friends, period. He's an honorable guy who's always been supportive and respectful to everyone in our family, and the idea of him being unfaithful to Lisa is honestly laughable. Our common ground is tech and business, not romance.\n\n\n And as for Lisa, it's not like I've cut her off without reason. Her accusations and actions lately have been off the rails. You think I should just smile and take that? Maybe you don't know the full story, but let's just say it's more complicated than you make it out to be.", "I get where you're coming from. I want to make clear though that there's nothing romantic between Mike and me - our chats are mostly geeking out over tech stuff. \n\nI've thought about family counseling with Lisa too, it might be a good way to bring some peace back into the family.", "Also for your sake you need to distance yourself from whole thing.", "[deleted]", "I can only imagine.  My siblings and I all went off into wildly different directions all across the country.  We keep in touch but (low whistle) if any one of us acted up like Lisa the rest would come down like a ton of bricks because accusations like that would not only be laughable, but a sign of a serious problem on the part of the accuser.\n\nI'm sorry your traditional family is indulging their 'othering' of you in such a hateful manner, to even entertain the thoughts are mind boggling to me.  Will Mike be able to get her in for a checkup?  It sounds like she needs it.", "I am glad that I could help. Best of luck to you.", "Why on earth would I expect you to \"just smile and take that\"?\n\nI expect you to communicate with your friend's wife in order to not add ridiculous amounts of stress to his life as well as your parents' lives.  Your sister is \"off the rails\" but you neither like nor respect her enough to try to get her help or to address her very serious concerns directly.  I don't expect you to care about your sister, because you don't.\n\nIf her husband is still seeing you and talking to you after her very publicly accusing both of you of an affair, then it's pretty *obvious* he does prioritize his relationship with you over his relationship with her.  And frankly? You post makes it look like you enjoy that.\n\nI would expect an ethical person to take her accusations very seriously and immediately address them with her.  The first time she accused her husband of preferring you or you of encouraging that should have been when you addressed it.  I would NOT be meeting with my sister's partner alone after a comment like that, forget about waiting until it escalated into a public shaming or *still* seeing him and having private conversations with him while actively excluding her.\n\nYou admit you think you might be TA because you want to spite her while also saying all of your behavior is okay because she joined an MLM?", "I already got that there's nothing \"romantic\" between you, and I'm telling you that people frequently hide their own motivations from themselves, and you may not be aware of all of yours. How about individual therapy for you too? You need it.", "Well, it\u2019s family. I\u2019d like to maintain my relationships with my niece and nephew. I am planning on stepping back until this blow over, however. Other than going to my niece\u2019s birthday party early next month, I\u2019ll be staying away.", "> I think your BIL is bonding with you not just professionally because he's realizing just how vulnerable the marital finances are. Not only will your sister not admit she's been duped by a scam, she's attacking your character at the same time because she is desperate for downlines and needs to distract from her lack of success. And since she has to \"fake it to make it\" she's probably spending more on not just the MLM but the appearances to seem as if she's successful in it.\nThe \"trad wife\" thing may not have phased him but perhaps he's realizing with her holding her staunch positions in regards to the MLM that he may be in for more than he bargained for with his wife.\n\n\nThanks for your perspective. \n\n\nI've definitely wondered if Mike is reaching out more because he's starting to see the financial pitfall that Lisa's MLM involvement could lead to. Growing up, Lisa was always stubborn and once she latched onto an idea, she wouldn't let go, even if it wasn't good for her. I suppose this MLM thing is just the adult version of that. \n\n\nThe \"trad wife\" aspect might be contributing too, but that's a whole different can of worms. I really do hope Mike can help her see sense before things get even worse.", "You hit the nail on the head, and thanks for getting it. Our family is... well, complex, like any other I guess. Lisa and I couldn't be more different if we tried, and I've always tried to respect her choices. It's just that now those choices involve me in a way I never expected. \n\n\n\nAs for Mike, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place - his wife and his old friend. He's doing what he can, though. Thanks for backing me up, it really does help.", "Sorry if I made it seem like I thought being TA was okay just because Lisa joined an MLM. That's not the case. Lisa's involvement in the MLM is a separate issue and, while it has caused some friction, it's not the root of the problem here.\n\n\n\nWhat's been bothering me is not the MLM itself, but Lisa's shift in behavior and attitude since she joined it. Her accusations came out of nowhere, and I've been struggling to reconcile this version of Lisa with the sister I used to know. That's led to some feelings of frustration and yes, maybe even spite, which I realize isn't productive or fair.\n\n\n\nBut spite isn't what's driving my actions. It's more about trying to preserve my relationship with Mike, a friend I've known and respected long before he became my brother-in-law, and trying to navigate this situation in a way that causes the least harm to everyone involved.\n\n\n\nI understand that you think I should have distanced myself from Mike the moment Lisa voiced her concerns, and in retrospect, you might be right. It's a tricky balance between preserving an innocent friendship and respecting my sister's feelings, and maybe I've erred on the wrong side. I'll take your points on board and consider how I can better handle this situation moving forward. Thanks for calling me out.", "Look, I get where you're coming from, but I'm not denying any feelings here. \n\n\n\nLet me share something about Mike and me. We were college friends before he ever met Lisa. We've shared long nights working on projects, brainstorming ideas, and troubleshooting together. It\u2019s a bond that has always been about mutual respect and collaboration, not romance. So, when you suggest that I'm unaware of my own motivations, it feels like you're dismissing that history. That said, I understand your points, and they've given me some food for thought. I am not opposed to counseling, and maybe individual therapy might indeed help me navigate this complicated situation better. \n\n\n\nThanks for your input.", "Bad idea.\nJust send a gift and talk on the phone and don't go to there home.\nYour sister has already humiliated you once, you don't know what will happen at your niece's birthday party, it would be a shame if your niece's birthday party was disrupted.", "Glad to help, if you want someone to talk to, feel free to message me or just comment here (I will see it).    \n\n\nYou're going to have to think about taking space from the two of them though, Lisa for obvious reasons, and Mike because you cannot continue to paint a target on your own back when dealing with the type of crazy Lisa is capable of.", "There should be no rock and hard place here for Mike. She is his wife. She also sounds like she needs some serious help. Bow out gracefully if only so you don't make his life worse.", "You say it\u2019s an innocent friendship, but it\u2019s not as innocent as you\u2019re trying to act like it is if internet strangers are sensing that there\u2019s an emotional relationship there. Especially when you\u2019ve posted this to make you seem as blameless as possible.", "The problem is that the friendship stopped being innocent the moment your sister expressed her concerns and neither you nor her husband changed your behaviors.  Her accusations absolutely did *not* come out of nowhere, even if you want to pretend they did.  Those sorts of concerns in a marriage are *not* something you can brush off unless you really do consider your friendship with him to be more important than his *marriage* to her.\n\nEven in your own story she began voicing her discomfort and made repeated statements that became much stronger statements over time.\n\nI would have serious side eye for any dude who heard his wife's concerns and didn't do anything differently.  My husband would have taken any such comment about him preferring someone as a \"record scratch\" stop-everything, serious discussion time moment.  Forget anything reaching the point of an accusation.\n\nI don't doubt your sister is acting erratically.  Many people do not handle their spouse having an affair well at all. Their are two people in your friendship, and while your feelings might be platonic, his might not.  The fact that he is *still* talking to you without his wife after she exposed his actions as publicly as she could?  He is putting you over his marriage.  That's fucked up.\n\nAnd even now you are more concerned about preserving your relationship with your sister's husband than you are with making sure your sister believes that you haven't betrayed her.  That's why no one here believes there's anything innocent about your motives in this either.", "Nope. I was pretty much fine with whatever up until your response previous to this one. You do not respect your sister or her marriage and you are creating a palpable enough chaos effect that it reads gross to internet strangers. You do not have a good reason to maintain the connection with Mike.", "You didn't give me that hx until now. Don't be defensive. What came before is no longer relevant. Mike married your sister, not you. That changed your relationship with him forever, but you can't acknowledge that. The more you talk, the more I can see your emotional attachment to him. You need therapy. Mike and Lisa need therapy. And your whole family needs therapy together.", "You raise a valid concern. Maybe I could have a chat with Mike about this to assess the situation, and if it seems like it could get messy, I'll take your advice and celebrate with her at a later, more private date. \n\n\nThanks for the advice. It\u2019s a tough call, but the welfare of my niblings is my primary concern.", "Thank you. It\u2019s just hard because of my niblings\u2014it\u2019s important to me to maintain my relationship with my niece and nephew. Since I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to Lisa after her outburst, Mike is really the only one I have to go to. The kids don\u2019t have phones (personally, I agree that they\u2019re too young) and I have no other way of staying in contact with them or being able to coordinate plans.", "Woah, let\u2019s take it down a notch. What exactly do you think I\u2019m leaving out here? I\u2019m trying to get an honest judgment and I think I\u2019ve been receptive to everyone\u2019s questions in the comments. \n\n\nWhat Mike and I have has always been entirely platonic and I think the baseless accusations of a few people here have been ridiculous. That being said I\u2019ve been discussing everything openly. Again, what exactly do you think I\u2019m leaving out here?", "I understand where you're coming from, but I'm genuinely not trying to create chaos or harm my sister's marriage in any way. Mike and I have been friends since before he met Lisa, and our bond is based on shared professional interests and mutual respect, not romantic or emotional entanglement.\n\n\n\nHere's something about Mike that I haven't mentioned yet: when we were in college, he was dating another classmate of ours. She was absolutely infatuated with him, but Mike was upfront about not feeling the same way. Even so, he continued to be kind, supportive, and respectful towards her. When she confessed her love for him, he gently and directly told her that he didn't share her feelings and couldn't reciprocate. It was hard for her, but he handled it with such grace and honesty, and it allowed them to remain friends without crossing any lines.\n\n\n\nThat's the Mike I know. He's a stand-up guy who is faithful and respectful, not someone who would engage in an affair or even an emotional relationship outside his marriage.\n\n\n\nBut your comment is giving me pause to consider if, despite our best intentions, our friendship is being perceived as disrespectful to Lisa or harmful to their marriage. I've always thought our relationship was innocent, but I'll certainly take your feedback on board and consider how best to approach this moving forward. Thank you for sharing your perspective.", "Hey, I hear you. I know it may seem like I'm trying to defend myself because, well, I am. But it's not out of an attachment to Mike, it's out of an attachment to truth and clarity. I'm sorry if my previous responses weren't clear enough; writing these words on the internet sometimes loses a bit of nuance.\n\n\n\nYes, Mike and I have history, but like you said, he married my sister. And I respect that - he is her husband first and foremost, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I've striven to be mindful of that in all my interactions with him.\n\n\n\nAnd you know what, you're right about therapy. It's a good tool for introspection and understanding, and maybe I've been too defensive to see that. I'll take up your suggestion and consider individual therapy. As for Mike and Lisa, that's something I hope they would consider too, but that's up to them.\n\n\n\nAs for our whole family needing therapy together, I've been pondering that as well. It would be an ideal place to address all these complex dynamics and perhaps start the process of healing. Thanks again for your input.", "STOP TALKING TO MIKE. This is why you\u2019re in the situation to begin with", "If it\u2019s so platonic then why do you insist on continuing a relationship with him instead of stepping back to respect his marriage? I just saw a comment that you were going to talk to Mike about whether you should join your nieces birthday party or not. Stop talking to him! It\u2019s not that hard.", "Or don't stop talking to Mike. Talking to an opposite-gender person isn't in itself a behaviour married/partnered folk need to avoid and if the sister is deep in an MLM he might need some support as well. They're generally dodgy and people can get caught up in them in a cult-like way. \n\nOP if you don't know of it already, the  [r/antiMLM](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/) sub and various antiMLM YouTube channels might be of interest to you.", "Yes!", "My relationship with my niece and nephew is important to me.

Did you make a comment during her presentation or something? \n\nAlso, I don't understand why you even attended the MLM event if you're so against them. \n\nI'm trying not to read between the lines, but it seems odd to me that your sister would launch into a tirade against you during her business presentation.\n\nEDIT: JUDGMENT NTA\nI would keep communicating with Mike because I'd be worried about my sister's mental health, and would want to stay informed and try to help in any way possible.", "NTA", ">The MLM Lisa is involved with has some seriously questionable practices that remind me of true crime stories I've read about such organizations. It's one of those ones that you see on the news where the top 1% make all the money while the rest end up in debt.\n\nNTA - Honestly that is every MLM, there is no good ones. I think you do need to go LC with Mike for a while. Lisa may very well be torpedoing her marriage and it's probably better to do back a bit.", "Yeah, the MLM event was a mess. I was there to support Lisa despite my reservations about MLMs. Things went sideways when she got some heat about her business. She threw me under the bus, saying I was meddling in her marriage and sabotaging her work.\n\n\n\nHer remarks about me and Mike caught me off guard. Mike and I go way back, long before he met Lisa. We're tech nerds, that's our bond. Never crossed the line into anything else. Lisa spun it out of control at her presentation.\n\n\n\nThe whole ordeal has us on eggshells. Mike's been a rock but we're trying to avoid adding more fuel to the fire. We've sidelined our tech chats for now to keep the peace at family gatherings. It's rough, but we're trying to get through it without making things worse.", "Thank you.", "Thanks for understanding my situation and the concern with MLMs. It\u2019s hard to see Lisa being pulled into one, especially one with this kind of track record.\n\n\n\nI appreciate your advice about limiting contact with Mike for the time being. I have been considering this course of action as it might help cool down the situation. It's just difficult, given our long-standing friendship and the fact that he's basically my link to my niece and nephew right now. But you're right, it might be for the best to step back a bit until the situation stabilizes. Thank you.", "Exactly. If you\u2019re not gonna be in her life, and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to, stay out of her husband\u2019s life.", "Yeah I've read through all the comments and it's pretty clear that you and Mike are just friends. Who all was giving her heat during her presentation?", "Thanks.\n\n\nAt the presentation, there was a mix of friends, family, and people Lisa's met through the MLM. Some people were supportive, but a few of our family friends (an old business partner of my parents, one of my coworkers from a college internship Lisa and I both had, one of my friends who teaches at a business program nearby) had valid concerns. They were asking hard questions about the business model, the products, the income she was making. They weren't aggressive, just trying to make sense of it all.", "If you want deep meaningful relationships with young nibblings that means you need to have a relationship with both parents. They're the kids'parents and have the ultimate say in their kids'lives. You can reestablish a closer relationship when they become independent adults.", "Ok I see. Well, if you didn't chime in when the others were \"ganging up\" on Lisa, then you appear to be a completely innocent bystander in that dramatic mess. I can see it from Lisa's point of view too. Obviously she doesn't feel she's working in a scam company, so basically she feels like she's working really hard and everyone was basically making fun of her. Her throwing you under the bus, and all her escalating behavior... it kinda sounds like she's going off the deep end, and that is concerning. She also likely feels like you and Mike are ganging up on her because it's clear that neither of you support her business \"venture\". Look, I detest MLM schemes, so I am 100% with you and Mike on this. It's just that I can see how lisa must feel. She needs therapy to deal with whatever emotion is telling her that you and Mike have something going on. As for the judgement, I think you are NTA for continuing communication with Mike. I talk with my sibling's spouses, and their ex-spouses. Sometimes I've even kept communication with said spouses whilst being low-contact with my brothers. I will talk to whoever I want to (Obviously, as long as I'm not participating in extra-marital affairs or being malicious in some way). Hopefully your sister and Mike can sort out their issues. This seems to have nothing to do with you; but you've become the target.", "Yea that\u2019s what it\u2019s looking it honestly. If my sister accused me of messing with her husband I would definitely take a step back from the friendship for a while . It doesn\u2019t look good at all that OP willing to ignore her sis and not talk to her but continue to speak to her husband AFTER being accused of having a affair with him no matter how you slice it that does not look good on both OP and husband part got me side eyeing \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 both of them \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udd28", "Thanks for sharing your viewpoint, and I see where you're coming from. But let me provide some clarity and context. Mike and I, we have a decade-long history of being friends before he even met Lisa. We bonded over tech, our passion, and it has remained that way. It's a friendship that's focused on mutual respect and shared interests, not romantic feelings. And believe me, if there were even the tiniest hint of romantic feelings from either of us, I would've put an immediate stop to it because I respect both Mike and my sister.\n\n\n\nAnd regarding the situation after Lisa expressed her concerns - I didn't brush them off. Mike and I did not continue our private discussions or meet-ups without Lisa's knowledge or consent. I respected her feelings and understood the potential impact on their marriage. Yes, it was hard to believe her accusations because they were unfounded, but I still chose to put distance for their sake.\n\n\n\nNow, concerning Mike. If you knew him, you'd know that his loyalty to Lisa is unwavering. He's been trying to work things out with her, to alleviate her insecurities. He values his marriage far more than our friendship.\n\n\n\nLastly, about Lisa's feelings. They matter to me, more than you may think. It hurts to see her feel betrayed when all I have ever had for her is love and concern. Her public accusations were a shock, but I want to find a way to heal this rift. I am more focused on repairing my relationship with my sister than maintaining my friendship with Mike. I don't want anyone in my family to be in pain.\n\n\n\nAgain, I appreciate your viewpoint. I hope this provides a better understanding of where I'm coming from.", "I just wanted to say this is beautifully put. I hope OP actually reads this and takes it to heart.", "That's a very pretty story, but you're NC with your sister and still talking to Mike.  I can't see how you expect that to alleviate her concerns.  Announcing your meetups with her husband is unlikely to make her feel better about them if she's already expressed her concerns multiple times.\n\nAgain, I don't see where the depth of your relationship with Mike has importance here except that you use it as justification for a lot while in the same breath calling your sister's accusations irrational.", "It isn\u2019t inherently a behavior to avoid but if my sister was so uncomfortable with my friendship with her husband that she thought I was having an affair I\u2019d take a step back from that relationship until they sorted out their issues out of respect. \n\nOP won\u2019t do that bc it\u2019s clear she enjoy the attention from Mike and enjoys causing an issue in their marriage.

It's also very possible that any kind of behaviour will be misinterpreted, so regardless of what OP and/Mike do sister will take issue.\n\nIt's not mentioned what MLM sister is into, but I've seen enough videos and posts about them to be aware of how weird and echo-chambery they can get.

I've been trying to communicate my side of the story, but it seems you're more intent on ascribing intentions to my actions that simply aren't there.\n\n\n\nThis isn't about me enjoying drama or attention. It's about my relationship with my niece and nephew, and my longstanding friendship with Mike, not some soap opera plot. I understand that Lisa's behavior has thrown a wrench into everything, but it doesn't change the fact that I have genuine relationships that I am trying to preserve.\n\n\n\nThe idea that I should stop talking to Mike entirely is unrealistic. He's been a friend of mine for years, even before he married my sister. I respect his marriage to Lisa, and I've never done anything to intentionally harm it. I never imagined that maintaining a friendship would be viewed as an attack on their relationship.\n\n\n\nHowever, I can see how some of my actions may have added fuel to the fire, and I am willing to make some changes. But implying that I'm some home wrecker enjoying the chaos is out of line. This situation is causing me a lot of pain, too. It's far from a situation anyone would enjoy.", "NTA Her behavior is bizarre. I do think you need to distance yourself from Mike some. I'm not saying end your friendship. Just back off a little because right or wrong (definitely wrong), your sister is upset by it. Be honest with Mike and let him know why you're backing off. Hopefully, this is temporary. He does need to figure out if his wife needs help and/or if they need to work on some issues, but at this time, you're not the appropriate person to discuss it with nor confide in. Sorry this happened. Your sister was deeply hurtful.", "NTA", "NTA for cutting off Lisa, but idk that it\u2019s wise to keep a close relationship with Mike.", "There are a lot of different businesses that can be folded into MLM- are we talking selling candles or Pampered Chef or are we talking a monetary investment in the next level of the business? As well, the fact that there were friends, family, AND people from the MLM suggests that this company is not a \u201cbuy a candle from your neighbor\u201d company and more of a financial investment. The professionals were brought in to help sell in a situation where the rest of the attendees were there to support their friend/family and generally be a nice person. They would have bought a candle but they\u2019re not pulling the IRA out and giving it to the MLM. \nThat\u2019s a lot of business pressure for your sister and those are some very good professional sales people. That\u2019s why they were there. Cut your sister some slack on the MLM front.\n\nBut OP, no one cares how long you and Mike have known each other or what level of friend you are. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is you are inserting yourself in between a husband and wife under the guise of \u201cjust wanting to help\u201d. And refusing to back down after being shown that.

I just think you lose out the most in carrying this relationship.", "I appreciate your honesty.\n\n\n\nKeeping a relationship with Mike while tensions are high is definitely tricky. But cutting him off entirely feels wrong, too. He's been my friend for years, long before he and Lisa got together. I don't want to jeopardize that because of this mess. But I do agree, we need to figure out how to navigate this situation better to reduce the strain on everyone. Thanks for your perspective, it's given me something to consider.", "I see where you're coming from, but this isn't about inserting myself in between a husband and wife. I'm not clinging to Mike out of some misguided sense of loyalty. This is about making sure that the children, my niblings, aren't lost amidst this chaos that the MLM has catalyzed.\n\n\n\nThe MLM Lisa is involved in isn't the innocent 'buy a candle from your neighbor' variety. It's the kind that urges people to drain their life savings for promises of impossible returns. The pressure it has put on Lisa is enormous, I agree. But it's also been exacerbating some darker issues Lisa's grappled with in the past. It's hard to watch her fall prey to these schemes while dragging her family into it.\n\n\n\nBacking away might seem like the easy and sensible thing to do, but when it involves innocent kids and a sibling spiraling, it's not that simple.\n\n\n\nIt's not about being a third person in their marriage but about being a constant in those kids' lives and helping my sister, even when she's too clouded by this MLM scam to realize she needs it.", "I appreciate your understanding. I've always been against MLMs and it kills me to see Lisa get sucked into one. I fear you might be right about her feeling jealous. It was never my intention to make her feel inferior or anything. Our careers just took different paths, that's all.\n\n\n\nI've been careful about my relationship with Mike. We both understand the situation and we're trying to handle it without causing more trouble. As for your advice about Mike cutting financial strings, I'd like to hope it doesn't come to that. But I fear the debt is already mounting. It's a real mess.\n\n\n\nI hope for all our sakes, especially the kids, things turn around before it's too late.

Yes, I do have a friendship with Mike, but that doesn't mean I value it more than my relationship with Lisa. \n\n\nThis isn't about me choosing Mike over Lisa. \n\n\nThis is about Lisa spiraling into a dark place, one we've unfortunately seen her go to before. Her obsession with her MLM and the paranoia she's displaying is reminiscent of a time in our past I'd hoped we'd left behind.\n\n\n\n My primary concern is the wellbeing of my niblings in this increasingly volatile environment.

I'm just doing my best to keep things stable for the kids amidst all this chaos.", "Ok but you do realize Lisa does not like you. She literally thinks you're trying to seduce her husband. If you keep trying to be in her husband and kids' lives she will start poisoning the kids against you. If they divorce she will blame you and tell her kids that it was your fault.\n\nI agree with the other commenter that you need to step back and just be the aunt who sends a card and gift/money for Christmas and birthdays for the time being.

We're walking on a tightrope here, trying to balance the well-being of the kids with Lisa's paranoia. So, before you start side-eyeing us, maybe consider that we're trying to manage a mess that we didn't even create.", "I appreciate your advice, but I can't simply distance myself for three months.

Other than that's your only motivation to fix things? \nYou have a weirdly obsessive focal point on MLMs when it literally has *nothing* to do with your narrative other than making your sister look ignorant and stupid.  \nSo instead of backing off, letting your sister cool down, and letting Mike know if things get worse, you're there; your solution is to... keep doing what you're doing?  \nIf Mike isn't happy in his marriage, that's on *him* to fix.

That cannot be an emotionally healthy environment.", "I appreciate your concern. Believe me, the thought of Lisa trying to sabotage my professional life has crossed my mind more than once. I have discussed this with my legal advisor to understand how best to protect myself and my business. It's a shame that it's come to this, considering she's my sister.\n\n\n\nLet's just say that some actions of Lisa's in the past have hinted at...potential extremes she might go to, and leave it at that. The situation is truly more convoluted than I ever imagined it could be. Thanks for your advice.", "I\u2019ll take you at your word that you don\u2019t have romantic feelings for Mike but you definitely have some sort of emotional possessiveness towards him. Idk why you came to AITA if you\u2019re just going to hit everyone with a \u201cwell there\u2019s things you don\u2019t know.\u201d \n\nFrom the info given in this post, you are way too emotionally intertwined with Mike and I can see why this would contribute to your sister\u2019s instability.", "Are you ever gonna say what these \u201cissues\u201d are? Or are you going to continue to make more vague hints?", "That's the tricky part. We've tried, believe me. But there's a pattern here, one that has persisted since our childhood. Whenever someone brings up professional help, Lisa tends to turn hostile, or withdraws completely.\n\n\n\nI know it's easy to judge from the outside and say, \"Why doesn't she just get help?\" But it's not that simple. It's a mix of denial, manipulation, and a knack for twisting even the most genuine attempts at assistance into perceived threats. So yes, we're concerned, but it's like trying to diffuse a bomb without the manual. One wrong move, and things could get a lot worse.", "Your simplifications aren't helpful here. This isn't some petty squabble or an attempt at revenge. It's about two kids caught up in a whirlwind. And I'm not going to just let them be swept away.\n\n\n\nSure, Mike's her husband. But before all this, he was my colleague, my friend. We've faced countless 2am server meltdowns, drank innumerable cups of coffee trying to understand outdated mainframe languages. We've got a bond that's older than his relationship with Lisa.\n\n\n\nAnd about 'giving space' - Lisa doesn't just have 'issues.' There's a reason she can't hold a job, a reason our parents tip-toe around her. I'm not ignoring the problem here, I'm trying to protect those kids from it. This isn't a storm to wait out, it's a chronic condition we're all trying to manage.", "Thanks for pointing me to that. I\u2019ll check it out.\n\n\nThe whole MLM scenario is like a vortex sucking Lisa further in. If only it was just about selling candles or Tupperware, you know? But things... they're much darker, and if the past is anything to go by... well, I just hope it doesn't spiral out of control. I guess this podcast might give me some insight, a bit of an understanding of the storm I'm walking into. Thanks again.", "I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s necessary to tell the whole internet every detail about my sister\u2019s life history, personal traumas, and the various ways she\u2019s hurt people in order to give a clear enough picture of the situation. Do you?", "I mean you\u2019re already airing her dirty laundry to the Internet, might as well say whatever it is.", "Thank you. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do.", "I've been trying to respect Mike's position in all of this. It's a difficult situation for him, and I would never wish to add to his burdens. As for Lisa needing help, I've suggested this to Mike a few times. I just hope she's open to it, because from past experiences, she's been... well, resistant to change or intervention, to put it mildly.\n\n\n\nBut /u/claudie888 , you hit the nail on the head. Mike and I were friends first, and our friendship has never crossed any lines. It feels wrong to abandon him at a time when he might need a friend most. I'm trying to balance my relationship with Mike and the children without further antagonizing Lisa. It's not easy, but I'm trying my best. I truly hope we can find a way to navigate through all this chaos.", "You make some good points. I see the potential for Lisa to paint a bad picture of me to the kids, and it breaks my heart. But let's just say that I have reasons to believe the kids aren't as impressionable as you might think. There are some deep-seated issues with Lisa, stuff that goes back way before Mike even entered the picture. I'm not going to air dirty laundry here, but it's enough to say, it's more complex than just sibling rivalry or imagined affairs.\n\n\n\nMike and I have had serious conversations about how to handle this. We're not ignorant of the potential fallout. But as you've pointed out, it's a tricky situation and we're walking a tightrope here. But I assure you, our primary concern is the well-being of those kids, above all else. Thanks for your advice, it's appreciated and taken onboard.", "Oh boy that second paragraph is starting to give credence to what your sister says about you. In that second paragraph you sound more like a mom trying to keep a stable home while divorcing instead of being an auntie. You shouldn't be having those types of conversations with Mike. Those are for him and his wife. She is their mother and has more of a say in their lives than you do. If they divorce she can make his life hell through those children by endless custody battles and trying for majority custody if she feels you are in anyway involved. You need to treat Mike like a business partner that he supposedly is. \n\nYou're too emotionally invested in Mike that it's starting to cross normal boundaries. No one is tell you stop being his friend or to not be auntie but you do need to back off and let things cool. You digging in your heels is and keep inserting yourself right now is just going to prove your sister's feelings right about you right now.", "NTA. Why on earth would it be put to YOU to make amends. Lisa is the one who owes everyone and you twice over an apology. \n\nCutting contact with her is probably the safest course of action for you. But you should consider cutting ties with Mike until either she addresses her behavior or he ends up with full custody of the kids after the (sounds like inevitable) divorce.", "INFO: Hey Op, I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re in this situation. I\u2019ve been reading all your comments and I just wanted to ask, given your friendship with Mike. Did you ever sit him down before he started dating your sister? Or after?\n\nIt kinda sounds like in the comments you\u2019re dancing around saying that your sister may have ASPD (anti-social not autism) or something along those lines.\n\nDid Mike want a trad wife? Or is this a huge 180 she pulled after the wedding? \n\nNTA, but your sister sounds seriously dangerous and kids are involved. I don\u2019t know if there are any social services near you (like get in contact with a head of time, nothing to report just resources). Or if you have a therapist you could see to discuss potential outcomes and issues.\n\nI get your parents are sick but I mean then tiptoeing and writing off Lisa\u2019s behavior has enabled her to become what she is. I don\u2019t know if they ever tried ti get her help or if they just tried to rug sweep her issues away. \n\nRight now I\u2019d focus on creating a paper trail of her unhinged behavior and tapping into professional mental health help for yourself to help give you professionals to lean on. \n\nThis sounds insanely difficult and really painful but you may need to be more of a ghost to her and her family while you try and build out a long term solution.", "As soon as you said she was part of an MLM I knew exactly the type of person your sister is. \nThe fact that you even showed up to the event shows you care about your family. I love my family but I would not go to an MLM event. Sorry, I will be inconveniently sick that day. \nYou are NTA. You are friends with your BIL and he has done nothing wrong. There appears to be nothing inappropriate about your relationship, your sister is just either insecure or/and wants attention for her \u201cbusiness.\u201d Either way, she started the drama and you decided not to partake in it.", "Look, here's my two cents as someone who was raised as a girl in a conservative family: girls in that culture are expected to be the ones who fix everything emotionally for everyone around them. You furthermore come across in describing your career as a \"fixer\". And I get the pressure to do something because it's *family* and you can't just . . . *not* be personally responsible for keeping every emotionally fragile ball in the air, right? \n\nBut OP, your approach to trying to emotionally manage EVERY person in this situation - mom, dad, kids, Lisa, Mike - to hold yourself personally responsible for \"defusing\" your sister's whole . . . *whatever*, is going to actively continue to make things worse as long as the root of this issue is that your sister thinks you're too wrapped up in her personal affairs. \n\nShe isn't a server you have to maintain, and you are uniquely positioned as the absolutely worst person on earth to help her and her husband work out whatever their whole deal is. Step back for everyone's sake, perhaps most especially your own.", "YTA for including your career info as if it matters in the slightest.", "From your comments, you are too involved in your niblings and Mike's lives, and your conversations with Mike go beyond that of a sister in law and brother in law. How they manage their relationship and their kids is up to them. Focus on yourself and go LC with them for the time being, for the sake of your sister's marriage and your relationship with sister and niblings.", "Whoa, hold on. Possessive? Obsessed? I think you're reading a bit too much into the situation. \n\n\nMike and I are close because we share a common interest and profession, but it's never crossed any lines. I'm aware that Lisa's feelings need to be prioritized, but it's not like I can do that effectively given her current mindset. I'm not sure where you're getting the idea that I'm \"obsessed\" with him from - it's frankly a bit off base. But thanks for your input anyway.", "You\u2019re absolutely right\u2014attending the party might be inviting more trouble, and honestly, it's been eating at me. The last thing I want is to ruin a special day for the kids because of adult issues. As for my relationship with Mike, I'm starting to see that maybe some distance could be beneficial, at least until Lisa calms down and we figure out how to navigate all of this. It's a tough pill to swallow, but sometimes the right decisions are the hardest ones. Thanks for your perspective.", "You're right. \n\n\nWe've really tried to help Lisa in the past - therapists, inpatient programs, even court-mandated anger management when she was younger. \n\n\nNone of it stuck.\n\n\n I worry about the kids, and I worry about Mike too. I see the strain this is putting on everyone. It's just so hard to take a step back when you can see the train wreck happening in slow motion. I do need to step away, but it's easier said than done. I appreciate your advice though, and I'm going to do my best to follow it.", "Yeah, you're probably right. It's just tough because of how close we've become. And he's also been such an important link for me to my niblings. But I can see how this mess can only be resolved if there's some distance. Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it.", "You've got a point, it's just been so hard to consider completely severing ties with Mike because of the kids. But the more I think about it and read comments like yours, the more it seems like it might be necessary, at least for a while. This whole thing is just a dumpster fire, and I don't want to add any more fuel to it. Thank you for your perspective, I'll definitely take it into consideration.", "Thank you. I\u2019ll try to address everything you asked about, but let me know if I missed anything:\n\n\n\n\nMike and I were friends long before he even met Lisa. Our friendship was well established before they started dating. It was unexpected when he started dating Lisa, but I supported it because I wanted them both to be happy. He knew she had some challenges but there really wasn\u2019t much to talk about at the time. She did a great job working on her anger issues when she was younger (court-ordered therapy works, folks!) and had a problem with honesty but he\u2019s never worried about her being faithful. As for Lisa potentially having ASPD...that's something I've wondered about, especially over the last few years. I'm not a psychiatrist, though, so I can only speculate.\n\n\nLisa didn't always identify as a \"trad wife.\" That was a change she made after getting involved with her MLMs and online communities.\nMike didn't necessarily want a trad wife, it's just who Lisa has become. He's trying to be supportive, but it's definitely not what he expected.\n\n\nYes, social services might be something to consider. Right now, the kids seem well-cared for, but Lisa's escalating behavior is worrying.\nAs for my parents, they've always been dismissive of Lisa's outbursts. I'm not sure they know how to handle it.\n\n\nAnd you're right, it might be best for me to step back and create some distance. It's a complicated situation and I definitely need some time to consider the best course of action.\n\n\nThanks for your perspective. I appreciate it.", "Honestly, I'm tempted to come down with a mysterious illness every time there's an MLM event, too. I went because I was hoping it would help keep the peace with Lisa. Clearly, that didn't work out so well.\n\n\n\nShe's been insecure and attention-seeking for as long as I can remember, and it's only intensified with her involvement in the MLM world. And you're right, Mike has done nothing wrong. He's just stuck in the middle of this mess.\n\n\n\nThanks for your perspective. It's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustration with this whole MLM nonsense.", "I see where you're coming from and I admit, I have a tendency to be the 'fixer' both professionally and personally. It\u2019s hard not to fall into those patterns when it's so ingrained. But I\u2019m grappling with the idea that I might be too involved and that stepping back may be better. It's something I definitely need to give more thought to. Thanks for your perspective.", "Really? \n\n\nI work in the same industry as Mike. That's relevant. Thanks for your perspective, though.", "Appreciate the advice, but you're making it sound like I've been hovering over Mike and the kids 24/7. Sure, we talk about work \u2013 we're in the same field, dealing with the same ancient COBOL systems that most folks avoid like the plague. \n\n\n\nAnd yes, I love my niblings to bits. They're family, and I want to be there for them. But after all the mess lately, maybe stepping back a bit isn't a bad idea. It's clear Mike and Lisa have stuff to sort out. Thanks for the reality check.", "Look, I'm not going to put a judgment, except that this seems way over reddit's pay grade, and if your sister has as many issues as you have implied throughout your responses (and for her lifetime, not just recently), she definitely needs professional help, whether she wants it or not. I don't think that taking a step back from talking to Mike for a bit would hurt, just to relieve some pressure for HIM in his marriage, because you're actually causing him to get a lot of grief from your sister (warranted or not). If you're that concerned about what might happen if you do (seriously, the kids won't forget you after a couple months), you're either way more intertwined with their marriage than you think, or the problems with your sister's mental health are worse than you've explained here and your family should be discussing ways to make her get the help she needs before it gets worse.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nFrom your updates Lisa sounds like she has underlying mental health issues or a neurodiversity or both.  Unfortunately they sound like cluster B traits which usually come with no insight.\n\nI would be very careful with what time you spend with her or what communication you have with her.  She does sound very dangerous and she could do anything.\n\nMike has an issue with his wife.  He may need to make some difficult decisions if Lisa has no insights.  \n\nThe MLM may not be the problem, but it may have have made Lisa's problems bigger and highlighted the bad parts of her character.\n\nI would be very wary of continuing contact with Mike as Lisa is very jealous.  If you need to speak to him, I'd be doing it in the presence of someone else to always have a witness.  This is to protect both of you.  Don't ring or text him either.  Lisa sounds unstable.\n\nAs for your niece and nephew, Lisa is controlling the narrative there.  You aren't owed a relationship with them and Lisa will poison them against you as they get older.  You only stand a change if Mike breaks up with Lisa.  There will be casualties here.\n\nYour parents stress may be caused by their inaction when Lisa was younger.  They don't have the right to guilt you over this.  The person at fault here is Lisa but she's getting the free pass like she always has.  The family members on your back are her enablers.. and so are your parents because they don't want to deal with Lisa's issues that she'll take out on them because she can't take them out on you.", "To me it sounds like she created this drama. You are just being a caring family member. And from what you describe this bussiness could have a layer of extreme views and extreme emotional abuse. Or at least brain washing. Like a cult but bussiness style. And that was extremly rude of her, not mention unprofessional, to bring up her personal opinions or concerns about you during a bussiness sale.\n\nNo doubt she was covering up it is shady. However by covering it up like that, she just proved it is without a doubt!! If it wasn't shady why did she feel the need to switch attention to you like that because her husband agreed with you? No doubt part of her true concerns is that this bussiness scheme will hurt her marriage possibly because it already is. And because you and Bil share interest as well as agree this bussiness is shady; she is parionod he will leave her for you. However the true irony is all she has to do to keep her marriage is 1. Drop the bussiness like a sink of rotten eggs. 2. Appologise in front of entrie family as well as later to you in private. 3. Pay back and earn trust to everyone involved in some form. 4. Get therapy. \n\nI am willing to bet even if someone told her this or show this comment she never will listen. Just double down rather admit she is wrong.", "Whoa, hold on there, I'm not doing this to cause problems. I care about those kids as much as I do about my own career. And Mike is more like a brother to me than just a friend. Our relationship has never been about undermining Lisa's marriage. What you're suggesting is that I drop a genuine friendship just because my sister is going off the rails. That's not fair to me, Mike, or the kids. Yes, I'll consider creating some distance, but don't make it sound like I'm the villain here. Lisa's issues run way deeper than me being friends with her husband. Let's get that straight.", "Your point hits closer to home than you might think. I've tried talking to Lisa directly about the financial risks of MLMs before. I've shown her articles, statistics, tried to have sit-down conversations, all to no avail. She sees it as me trying to 'undermine her business'. Mike is aware, but seems reluctant to rock the boat any further right now. It's like banging my head against a brick wall, really. It's concerning, especially with the kids in the mix, but I'm unsure what more I can do at this point. Thanks for the comment.", "She's that much of a risk to you, she's convinced herself you're after her husband, and she's already publicly denounced / humiliated you.... If I were you I'd be very concerned that maintaining the friendship with Mike will push her to do something more.  Whether or not she is utterly deluded about the relationship, and regardless of the fact you *should* be able to be friends with your BIL, don't you think it would be wise to hit pause on the friendship for now?", "You've hit the nail on the head about MLMs. They're destructive and exploitative, and they're excellent at targeting people who are vulnerable or looking for some sort of validation or community. In Lisa's case, I think her rough childhood definitely made her an easy target.\n\n\n\nAs for her mental state, it's been hard to tell what's due to the MLM and what's just Lisa being Lisa. She's always had difficulty with self-awareness and empathy, and her involvement in the MLM seems to have exacerbated those issues. It's been a hard situation for everyone involved, but your perspective is helpful. Thanks for your insights.", "OP You need to realize that your help is making things worse, lower the contact with Mike, keeping the contact is only giving your sister ammunition.\n\nThis is a problem that Mike and your sister has to solve, your worries are valid but in the end you need to give Mike space to handle it, you need to understand that even legally you can't take the responsability here, focus on your own life and your parents, they need you more now.", "Dealing with this crap is not easy.

Lisa has been in therapy multiple times throughout her life, and was even in court-ordered anger management and inpatient programs as a teenager. As an adult, though, it's been challenging to get her to agree to get help. You can't force someone into therapy if they don't want to go, and unfortunately, Lisa is insistent that she doesn't have a problem. The rest of the family and I have tried everything we can think of, but it's ultimately her decision. It's frustrating and heartbreaking, but we haven't given up hope.", "NTA", "I\u2019ve read the post, I\u2019ve read the comments, and I\u2019m left with some questions. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you maintain a connection to the kids through your sister?

All she sees is the fire as her eminent threat, and you\u2019re adding gasoline, whether you intended to or not.
