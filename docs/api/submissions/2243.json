My dad (61) started dating our neighbour Janet (58h) 6 months later; she was a neighbour and casual family friend. It would have been fine, but I was still living at home and they were spending their time together openly cuddling at our home. It crossed my boundaries. The boundaries kept being crossed - my dad and I were going to visit my sisters family in the UK for the first Christmas without my mom. Who comes? Janet. My dad and Janet make the trip a romantic vacation about them. \n\n10 months after my mom died, Janet fully moves in. Suddenly, I\u2019m not allowed to watch television or use the microwave past 9 pm (when she goes to bed) and I\u2019m called disrespectful and not normal for doing what I had been doing my whole life.  I struggle with insomnia and am a night owl. It\u2019s never been an issue before. I move out ASAP. I do not receive financial support, which is fine. \n\nFlash forward to now. My dad and her have moved to the country 3 hours away. It is her house but they split the cost. It\u2019s weird going over - no pictures of my mom up; belongings from my childhood home (things my mom picked out) all over the house. My moms ashes are in the basement, but I need to ask permission to go down there. \nWhen visiting, I\u2019m not allowed to use the laundry machine - it broke one time after I visited and I\u2019m blamed, despite being 29 and having done my own laundry forever. \n\nLast week i visited. Janet made my favourite meal, GF lasagna, which was kind. There are six slices left over and i see my dad put them in the freezer. It\u2019s 9:30 and I\u2019m hungry - I go to the fridge to get a slice of lasagna. It\u2019s sadly frozen and it\u2019s too late to microwave, so I move one slice of lasagna from the freezer to the fridge for tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t typically do this with their other frozen meals, but this was made for me and I know my dad would want m to eat it. \n\nThe following morning, Janet confronts me. \u201cI saw you moved a slice of lasagna from the freezer and moved it to the fridge. You need to ask before you take something from the fridge. This is our food and I manage a household.\u201d\n\nI shut down. A few minutes later, I freak out to my dad - Im livid; im crying. I tell him coming here is difficult enough already and that what she said implied I was not a welcome guest or a member of the family, and as a 29 year old  adult, I shouldn\u2019t be controlled in this way. He simply says \u201cshe never had kids, so she doesn\u2019t get it. She gets mad at me if I eat late as well\u201d. My dad tells her he will be spending the day with me outside the house; I didn\u2019t request it but it was a nice gesture and we have a nice day. \n\nJanet tries to patch things up at nice but essentially just calls me dramatic, that she never ate without permission growing up, and tells me it\u2019s her house her rules. The next morning, I inform my dad I\u2019m happy to visit again, but I\u2019ll be staying in a hotel in future bc it\u2019s just too difficult. I let him know he is always welcome to stay with me. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668373524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yue7kj/aita_for_being_upset_i_need_to_ask_permission_for/", "score": 482, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knows damned well that asking for permission to open the fridge, or eat anything at all while visiting is absurd. She's making you unwelcome because she doesn't want you there. Your dad lives with her, not you, so of course he's going to take her side, every time. You did well to propose staying in a hotel for future visits. Frankly I think that's overgenerous. I'd go LC or NC & give Janet (& your dad 'cause what she wants is what he wants) what she wants.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is between a rock and a hard place but should be supporting you more. His wife may not have kids or understand, but being super petty is not the way to learn.", "NTA you arent trying to change the rules of the house (even though that makes the most sense since this woman is just utterly unreasonable) you found a very reasonable compromise, you visit but stay at a hotel\n\nYour father has shown you a lot of disrespect though ever since your mother died, he AND she are AH", "NTA, absolutely. There are some things here that might be. . .bad judgment or misunderstanding on her part, or just the difficulties of life with a remarried widowed parent (the lack of pictures, for example), but the idea that you are neither a family member nor a \"welcome guest\" is horrible. As a lifelong reader of Miss Manners, I'm pretty sure she would say there is NO category of guests to your home it is acceptable to treat that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I would ask if you can take your mother's ashes out of the home (you can figure out with your siblings if there is a better solution), and then go ahead with your plan to stay in a hotel, and only see your father and interact with Janet minimally. Frankly, a lot of people would want to distance themselves from their father for permitting this kind of treatment, and I think they would be justified. (But of course, continuing a relationship with your father is totally up to you.)", "NTA\n\nIf your moms ashes are in the basement, ask your dad for them along with any of her stuff as mementos.", "NTA. Honestly you're handling this overall pretty maturely. Kudos and sorry for your loss.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve done exactly the right thing by deciding to find other ways to spend time with your dad.", "Dad is enabling mistreatment, Janet TOTALLY knows what she's doing.   \n\n\nNTA- tell dad you're never coming again.", "NTA. Your father will always take her side. You offered a good compromise.", "NTA, Janet is TA! She jumped into your life and now makes you feel like you\u2019re an annoying unwanted guest and she even did that when she moved into YOUR house. Your dad is also TA for letting her dictate all the rules and not standing up for you. I\u2019d be staying in a hotel too or I\u2019d bring my own food, she\u2019s so rude!", "NTA.\n\nBeing a good host means taking care of guests' needs. That's especially true for family, and I'd say your father hasn't been treating you like family if you aren't allowed to visit your mother's ashes and eat when you're hungry. I'm sorry to hear that they're so unkind toward you.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're having to go through this.\n\nI'm glad your dad spent the day with you but he needs to be speaking to Janet about this and teaching her how to consider others. It's no excuse that she hasn't had children, she should know to male guests comfortable in her house - and you're family.\n\nSuch a grim situation and seems very odd with the ashes being in the basement and you having to ask permission to go there. Are you able to talk to your dad about all of this and see if he'll speak to her?", "Nta. I'm 26 and if I go visit my parents and get hungry I eat food out of the fridge and pantry like its my own house. My partner does this at his parents house too. Its normal I thought. My parents try to force food on me usually.", "NTA.  Getting a hotel room is a good plan.", "NTA. Janet doesn't sound like someone many people would want to live with. (how loud or disruptive is a microwave use at night, anyway?? good grief)", "NTA\n\nJanet is off her rocker and a complete control freak.\n\nPlease stay in contact with your dad and make sure his finances are secure.

Then next thing you know he falls ill and passes and she inherits his assets and is an insurance beneficiary.", "I\u2019m torn on this one. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, then I think you should follow the house rules\u2014even if they\u2019re silly. \n\nAs someone who experienced food scarcity and grew up with some weird food rules, I can see her side. \n\nBut I can see yours too. You\u2019re an adult. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for choosing not to stay there when you visit. I always get a hotel room when I go \u201chome\u201d.\n\nSo I\u2019m going with NTA.", "I would say NTA, but barely. The appropriate response to \"You need to ask for permission before you take something from the fridge\" would be \"ok, sorry, won't happen again!\" It's also just the polite thing to do before you take something out of someone's freezer to eat, even family members. You don't live there, and them putting it in the freezer implies they would be eating at a later date. I know 100% my mom would give me anything out of her fridge, but if I went to visit I would still politely ask to take anything from it to eat. \n\nIt seems like you are more upset at the whole situation and the relationship between her and your dad, and this probably has nothing to do with the lasagna, so the real answer is you are NTA for having these strong feelings about your dad's relationship.", "NTA.  Your dad's going to take her side because he doesn't want to be alone.  Never stay in their home again, and never eat in her house again.  She's lost that privilege of hosting you.  Sad that her controlling neurosis is more important to her than your father's happiness at seeing you, but then, she doesn't want him to see you.  I'd have him visit you at a hotel...without her.  If he brings her, leave the meeting.", "It's their house.", "NTA but you are 29 yrs old. Time to leave that nest and move out to your own place. Your father will always side with his new partner and you are too old to throw temper tantrums when these stupid rules come up. They'll always be a new stupid rule.

I think you need to ask your father if you can have the things that are your mother's, and take a portion of your mother's ashes and I don't think you should ask for that, and then have a conversation with your father about the woman he's in a relationship with.\n\nThat way, if he chooses to stay with Janet and lashes out at you for having concerns, you know your mother's stuff is no longer in the mix of this. Because I highly doubt your father will follow the agreement and keep that stuff in safe keeping for you later. If you wanted you to have it, you would already have it now so you should push for it.\n\nAnd really like if you want to try and help your dad, have a come to Jesus with him, and if he rejects you, then go low contact. Cuz she sounds horrible, and if he wants her gone he has the power to fight back. You shouldn't deal with her", "You are NTA, Janet is. The thing that stuck out to me is that your mom\u2019s ashes are in the basement. That\u2019s very disrespectful. I\u2019d ask your dad if you could take the ashes to keep at your place.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nThis all made me sad to read, especially the fact you have to ask permission to visit your mothers ashes. I would honestly call her out more because she doesnt deserve respect. I'm surprised you kept the peace so long. I'm sorry op.", "NTA\n\nJanet sounds like a nightmare, completely bonkers.", "NTA they are behaving like freaks. Controlling beyond anything like the norm.\n\nI'd personally steal the ashes and cut ties. But don't take advice from me, I have a temper.", "NTA. It's a good call to not stay in Janet's home ever again. Try to get your dad to do more one-on-one things with you, since that went well for you two.", "NTA You made a good decision. Your step mother is not a wholesome influence on you.", "NTA. Never. Go. Back. Your dad doesn\u2019t deserve your visits since he\u2019s clearly fine with this (he tries to make it go away without solving the actual problem, that being his super controlling wife).", "NTA. Staying at a hotel is a good call.", "NTA! Take your Mum's ashes and treat them with the respect they deserve, please.", "NTA \n\nPlease take your mom out of the basement. She deserves more respect than to be hidden away like a dust bunny.", " Wow NTA but I would definitely be limiting my visits for a bit and definitely not staying at their house. It\u2019s a wonderful thing Janet never had kids of her own!!", "Your dad is in an abusive relationship. He needs therapy and is likely using Janet to cope with the loss of your mom.", "Nta. This is abusive. Do not put up with her BS. this is how eating disorders start", "NTA\n\nand all I can think of is the stepmom in Fleabag.", "Tbh it sounds like Janet was abused herself as a child. Not that that excuses her behavior.", "Basic common decency would require you to at least have asked at one point in the past: hey mum, dad I'm hungry, is it okay if I take something? At whicj point they would have told you: sure sugarplum just take whatever whenever you feel like it when you visit. If not then you are just rude.", "That\u2019s my thing, OP needs to take her mom out and put her somewhere respectable, it feels like he\u2019s trying to erase/forget about her in less than a year\u2019s time", "1. Their mom had JUST died 2. It was their first holiday without said mother \nI fail to see how that is okay AT ALL but you do you.", "Spot on. This type of stepmother only gets more controlling as time goes on, and those ashes will be binned. Don't expect your father to see the light either, they rarely do. Oh, and expect no inheritance either because she'll make damn sure she gets the lot. It doesn't matter how many lawyers are in the family.", "Thank you. I think I needed to hear from a parent on this one.", "You people ignore the part that it was literally only a few MONTHS after his mom had died. Idk about you but if my mom died and my dad basically immediately turned around and started cuddling some random lady from across the street I would be SEVERELY uncomfortable...", "That is how I explain it to people. Fun fact: Janet was friends with my mom before even having a casual friendship with my father.", "Oh, damn. Invite your dad to your place and just him. No Janet. He needs to remember what his life was like before getting with her. He might have started dating hime because of his grief over your num's death but you can show him that he can move on from.that grief with you and without Janet. She sounds abusive and you are right to worry about your dad. Call and visit him as often as you can so he can have an excuse to get away from Janet. Good luck!", "Are there any other relatives you could compare notes with and if appropriate perform a sort of intervention? Men can be abuse victims too.", "I'm so sorry. Sounds like the lunatic my dad married because he couldn't stand to be alone.", "The financial support explanation was to explain that I was not a leech on my dad.\n\nI had chosen to live at home that year after my mom had died so my dad wouldn\u2019t be alone. I had plans to move work in Colombia that year but cancelled. I had paid my own rent, worked, and went to school between 19 and 22. I moved home at 23. I was home for a year, then my mom died and I realized I needed to stay another year instead of leaving my dad alone in his grief.\n\nThe other descriptions are relevant as they provide context to my stress level and our relationship. If this was just a house and I took food without permission, yeah, I\u2019m an asshole. But this is my fathers home - he buys the food has always let me eat a meal to celebrate me with asking. The meal was made to celebrate my visiting. I\u2019ve visited many times and not eaten their frozen meals bc I knew to ask. The issue is not that she made the request, it was the follow up comments explaining why I needed to ask - the explanations i shouldn\u2019t feel at home where my dad lives. I didn\u2019t fully appreciate until now was that this is Janet\u2019s house more than my dads home.", "[deleted]", "Are.you Janet?", "So if they're hungry at night when nobody is around to ask, they're not allowed to eat under these silly rules and must go to bed hungry. Some way to treat your own child!", "My parents have always said home is a place you won't ever have to go hungry. If I ever do ask my mum says don't be silly. Same thing if they come to my house.", "Hi Janet!", "I was actually planning to work abroad that year but cancelled after my mom died to stay home\u2026", "Maybe you missed the part where her mom was barely even dead when this started. She was helping her father with the transition when this woman moved herself in.", "Why are you upset that they don't have pictures of your mom at their new house? How is they cuddling at his home a boundary to you? You are a guest at their house of course you have to ask permission to take food out of the fridge! Is good manners.", "You should work on getting power of attorney for your dad so she doesn't screw you and your sister over when he's not capable of making decisions. I don't trust her one bit. And do a trip of alone time with him and have a heart to heart. Maybe he'll remember your mother again that way and leave.", "My dad was married to my mom for 30 years. They have art she owned up, but not pictures of her. They have family photos of others, but not her. Janet was friends with my mom before even having a casual friendship with my father.  \n\nJanet lived across the street in a whole house alone and they decided to cuddle in the open concept living room / kitchen where I lived. They didn\u2019t even go to the bedroom. I was forced to be around them while I just tried to cook and eat.", "This. Also people are forgetting they are retirement age which normally means a fixed income. OP could have made a PB&J sandwich or something but picked out a whole entr\u00e9e meal from the freezer... after eating already. My elderly fixed income parents make big meals for the family and no one really takes to much of seconds because it's well understood that the leftovers will be meals for them for the remaining week.", "Not being rude here but is your dad all there upstairs? Do you think he may have early onset dementia or something else making his cognition poorer than usual? Other than just grief and loneliness?", "So what? Your father was widow and was free to cuddle any person he wanted and they have the right to decorate their house as they wanted, is theirs house not yours. You are too old for this shit, grow up", "Also here to say that if it's not written in the will, she legally owns all of it after your father dies.", "This is terrible, I\u2019m so sorry. My heart hurts for your father", "Exactly. Male widows are considered the unicorns of the dating/romance world.\n\nIt's usually put like this. All the good men are either taken, gay, or live with their mothers. So when one of those details changes, every woman who can clock that change, and likes what she sees, immediately makes a jump for it. OP, your dad was a taken man, then your mother died. Janet saw an opportunity.\n\nIt is not right. It is not fair. What she did was downright manipulative. Your father did not see it for what it was, and unfortunately, whether they have children or not, this is ridiculously common with stepmothers. They are very controlling, and almost seem to purposely push away and existing children, if not push for their own offspring to get all the attention. As much as I can tell this is a real problem, I can't think of much else to do besides have a talk with your dad, and if he doesn't come to realize what's happened, simply reduce the amount of contact you have.\n\nETA: I felt the need to clarify something stated above. This is not to say all stepmothers are controlling and manipulative. It is just common to see amongst women who become stepmothers. Any woman who becomes a stepmother does not immediately become controlling and manipulative, she was already like that. Becoming a stepmother just puts it on display for those affected by it.", "Some men cannot be alone. For them, it is better to be with anyone, even someone who has issues, than be alone.", "Is this how you\u2019d want people to speak to you if a parent dies? Sheeeeeeesh", "His mom had JUST died that year... Get some empathy good God.", "I disagree.  This scenario assumes OP's father can't think for himself, was bamboozled into being with Janet, and is helplessly wringing his hands over the conflict between his wife and his adult child.\n\nThe father is a fully functioning adult.  He was probably very willing to accept the attention of a woman who would cook for him, clean for him, do his laundry, sleep with him, and fulfill his ideal of What A Wife Is Supposed To Do.\n\nHis arm was not twisted.  His eyes were wide open.\n\nHe is willing to excuse her controlling, unwelcoming behavior with his adult child because that's the easiest thing for him to do.\n\nHe is equally at fault here.  He is willingly complicit, because it is to his benefit, and he can blame her childlessness instead of accepting any responsibility.", "Were you able to solve those issues at all? She did get reported for elder abuse or had anything done against her? Called out in public?", "Unfortunately no. This happened a long time ago, 1988, and I rarely think about it. When I read something on AITA that reminds me, I share it so others can learn.  Very few people are that rotten, but there are red flags, like isolating a person from friend and family.", "My deep condolences. I hope she had consequences of some kind."]}
