She knows damned well that asking for permission to open the fridge, or eat anything at all while visiting is absurd. She's making you unwelcome because she doesn't want you there. Your dad lives with her, not you, so of course he's going to take her side, every time. You did well to propose staying in a hotel for future visits. Frankly I think that's overgenerous.

There are some things here that might be. . .bad judgment or misunderstanding on her part, or just the difficulties of life with a remarried widowed parent (the lack of pictures, for example), but the idea that you are neither a family member nor a \"welcome guest\" is horrible.

Frankly, a lot of people would want to distance themselves from their father for permitting this kind of treatment, and I think they would be justified. (But of course, continuing a relationship with your father is totally up to you.)", "NTA\n\nIf your moms ashes are in the basement, ask your dad for them along with any of her stuff as mementos.", "NTA.

Your dad is also TA for letting her dictate all the rules and not standing up for you. I\u2019d be staying in a hotel too or I\u2019d bring my own food, she\u2019s so rude!", "NTA.\n\nBeing a good host means taking care of guests' needs.

The appropriate response to \"You need to ask for permission before you take something from the fridge\" would be \"ok, sorry, won't happen again!\" It's also just the polite thing to do before you take something out of someone's freezer to eat, even family members. You don't live there, and them putting it in the freezer implies they would be eating at a later date. I know 100% my mom would give me anything out of her fridge, but if I went to visit I would still politely ask to take anything from it to eat. \n\nIt seems like you are more upset at the whole situation and the relationship between her and your dad, and this probably has nothing to do with the lasagna, so the real answer is you are NTA for having these strong feelings about your dad's relationship.", "NTA.  Your dad's going to take her side because he doesn't want to be alone.  Never stay in their home again, and never eat in her house again.  She's lost that privilege of hosting you.  Sad that her controlling neurosis is more important to her than your father's happiness at seeing you, but then, she doesn't want him to see you.  I'd have him visit you at a hotel...without her.  If he brings her, leave the meeting.", "It's their house.", "NTA but you are 29 yrs old. Time to leave that nest and move out to your own place.

My parents had been married 30 years My dad (61) started dating our neighbour Janet (58h 6 months later; she was a neighbour and casual family friend. It would have been fine, but I was still living at home and they were spending their time together openly cuddling at our home. It crossed my boundaries. The boundaries kept being crossed - my dad and I were going to visit my sisters family in the UK for the first Christmas without my mom. Who comes? Janet. My dad and Janet make the trip a romantic vacation about them. \n\n10 months after my mom died, Janet fully moves in. Suddenly, I\u2019m not allowed to watch television or use the microwave past 9 pm (when she goes to bed) and I\u2019m called disrespectful and not normal for doing what I had been doing my whole life.  I struggle with insomnia and am a night owl. It\u2019s never been an issue before. I move out ASAP. I do not receive financial support, which is fine. \n\nFlash forward to now. My dad and her have moved to the country 3 hours away. It is her house but they split the cost. It\u2019s weird going over - no pictures of my mom up; belongings from my childhood home (things my mom picked out) all over the house. My moms ashes are in the basement, but I need to ask permission to go down there. \nWhen visiting, I\u2019m not allowed to use the laundry machine - it broke one time after I visited and I\u2019m blamed, despite being 29 and having done my own laundry forever. \n\nLast week i visited. Janet made my favourite meal, GF lasagna, which was kind. There are six slices left over and i see my dad put them in the freezer. It\u2019s 9:30 and I\u2019m hungry - I go to the fridge to get a slice of lasagna. It\u2019s sadly frozen and it\u2019s too late to microwave, so I move one slice of lasagna from the freezer to the fridge for tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t typically do this with their other frozen meals, but this was made for me and I know my dad would want m to eat it. \n\nThe following morning, Janet confronts me. \u201cI saw you moved a slice of lasagna from the freezer and moved it to the fridge. You need to ask before you take something from the fridge. This is our food and I manage a household.\u201d\n\nI shut down. A few minutes later, I freak out to my dad - Im livid; im crying. I tell him coming here is difficult enough already and that what she said implied I was not a welcome guest or a member of the family, and as a 29 year old  adult, I shouldn\u2019t be controlled in this way. He simply says \u201cshe never had kids, so she doesn\u2019t get it. She gets mad at me if I eat late as well\u201d. My dad tells her he will be spending the day with me outside the house; I didn\u2019t request it but it was a nice gesture and we have a nice day. \n\nJanet tries to patch things up at nice but essentially just calls me dramatic, that she never ate without permission growing up, and tells me it\u2019s her house he rules. The next morning, I inform my dad I\u2019m happy to visit again, but I\u2019ll be staying in a hotel in future bc it\u2019s just too difficult. I let him know he is always welcome to stay with me. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think I needed to hear from a parent on this one.", "You people ignore the part that it was literally only a few MONTHS after his mom had died.

Fun fact: Janet was friends with my mom before even having a casual friendship with my father.", "Oh, damn. Invite your dad to your place and just him. No Janet. He needs to remember what his life was like before getting with her. He might have started dating her because of his grief over your num's death but you can show him that he can move on from that grief with you and without Janet. She sounds abusive and you are right to worry about your dad. Call and visit him as often as you can so he can have an excuse to get away from Janet.

I was home for a year, then my mom died and I realized I needed to stay another year instead of leaving my dad alone in his grief.\n\nThe other descriptions are relevant as they provide context to my stress level and our relationship. If this was just a house and I took food without permission, yeah, I\u2019m an asshole. But this is my fathers home - he buys the food has always let me eat a meal to celebrate me with asking. The meal was made to celebrate my visiting. I\u2019ve visited many times and not eaten their frozen meals bc I knew to ask. The issue is not that she made the request, it was the follow up comments explaining why I needed to ask - the explanations i shouldn\u2019t feel at home where my dad lives.

As much as I can tell this is a real problem, I can't think of much else to do besides have a talk with your dad, and if he doesn't come to realize what's happened, simply reduce the amount of contact you have.\n\nETA: I felt the need to clarify something stated above.

His eyes were wide open.\n\nHe is willing to excuse her controlling, unwelcoming behavior with his adult child because that's the easiest thing for him to do.\n\nHe is equally at fault here.

What is disrespectful, is relegating the mother's/ex wife's ashes to the basement. Beyond rude! The father needs to grow a spine and stand up to the new wife about that, and a lot of other things.\n\nOP, it might result in a fight and more bad blood, but I would do everything I could to take my mom's ashes with me.

Leaving the house is the best thing you could have done.\n\nEdit to add: the more I think about it, the more I'm sure that woman is on a power trip. She needs to be in control. She is a psychological abuser, and is psychologically abusing your dad. She preyed upon a grieving widower who was at his most vulnerable and desperate to be with someone again. She told you all of your childhood routines were wrong, and tried to make you conform to her ways. She imposed a bed time, because when she goes to bed, everyone else should too. Now she is restricting your access to your own mother's ashes by making you ask permission to enter the room in which they are kept (implying that she can deny you access to them if she wants to), and she makes food specifically for you and then demands that you ask permission to eat it. Not to mention that she is keeping and displaying things from your childhood home that your *mother* picked out, further implying that she is now the woman of the house and controls everything in it. She's controlling, plain and simple, and I guarantee she is doing the same to your dad.\n\nBe very careful. This reminds me of my mother's stepmother. She was very much the same; she preyed upon my widower grandfather and he married her and took in her two children. She then went through all of his deceased wife's things, kept what she wanted, and held a yardsale with the rest of it, telling my mom and her brothers that if they wanted anything of their mother's, they'd better show up early with money. She made them buy heirlooms back. She tried to do the same when my grandfather died.

Ashes in basement I would be livid.", "Your 29 and while it is Janet\u2019s house you are not her subordinate. Don\u2019t like being talked to like a child then you tell her, calmly, that you do not answer to her and respect is not blind obedience. Your an equal and can demand to be treated accordingly. NTA", "Janet needs to chill out and smoke a blunt\n\nAnd take the stick out of her ass", "The new wife is the AH. I\u2019d rip her a new one lol if she wants your dad in her life then you come as well.", "NTA.  I\u2019m a bit worried about your dad.  Is there any way he\u2019ll let you take your mom\u2019s ashes home?", "ESH. It doesn't sound like she's very welcoming of you, and that sucks, but this IS NOT your childhood home. Just because someone is family doesn't entitle you to make yourself at home in their house, I wouldn't go digging through the freezer or cupboards at most of my relative's homes. We get lots of AITA posts about relatives \"making themselves at home\" and intruding; you knew how controlling she was about stuff like this in your shared home and should have expected it when you went to visit. There are plenty of relatives where I prefer to stay at a hotel when I visit because I don't feel comfortable alone in their homes.\n\nThe reason \"your mom's\" things are in her house is because she welcomed your father to live with her and he brought things of his, they aren't stolen from your mother; they belong to your father now.\n\nYou had no right to \"have boundaries\" about your father and his girlfriend or wife being affectionate in the house. This woman has never been a motherly figure to you, she married a widow with an adult child she barely knew you and it sounds like you lived together for less than a year... Now you're taking a vacation to see them and angry about their house rules.\n\nShe is not your family, you don't think of her as family and she doesn't think of you as family. It sounds like you made her feel pretty unwelcome complaining that she was affectionate with your father in his house before she ever moved in and started setting rules about quiet time and grocery budgets. The ONLY thing you can do here is tell your father that you want to visit more but that you don't feel very welcome and that he needs to talk to her about loosening up those house rules before you come again.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds lovely. NOT.\n\nTalk to your dad privately.", "When I go to my inlaws they say I should help myself because I am family. If there is something they don't want me to eat they let me know. I don't understand all this permission to do things in what is supposed to be a family home.", "OP doesn\u2019t live with this couple.", "Report her for elder abuse. Anonymously of course.", "Wow. That\u2019s certainly blunt. \n\nJanet sounds incredibly difficult and unpleasant and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re forced to deal with this.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA. Janet is. The fact that your father just meekly accepts her \u201ckooky\u201d ways makes me question how she treats him when you\u2019re not around. She sounds incredibly controlling.", ">All she said was: you ask before you take from the fridge in a house in which you do not live. I am fairly certain miss manners puts that at the top of common decency. All the rest of OPs post is irrelevant to what they did.\n\nYou might be a troll, but to Miss Manners, the cardinal rule of hosts and guests is that you do not make guests uncomfortable.\n\nAnd when it comes to \"common decency,\" telling your husband's child they are not a member of the family nor a welcome guest is a lot higher on the list.", "I am both a stepdaughter and a stepmom. We live in the home my stepkids grew up in (we met after his divorce, which was amicable). When I moved in, they were still in high school, and my top priority from the start was their adjustment\u2014knowing that even though they liked me, it was hard. So it was important to me that they felt like I was moving into their home, rather than feeling like I was taking it over as mine. They\u2019re out of high school now, but if I know they\u2019re coming over, I buy more snacks and things they like. We were thinking at one point of moving into the house I owned when my husband and I met, after they both graduated. But if we had, I would have done everything I could to make them feel just as at home there as they do in their childhood house.\n\nI also cannot imagine my stepdad ever wanting me to ask for food when I visit him and my mom. \n\nThis new wife sounds nuts and even almost cruel, considering her disregard for your feelings. I\u2019m sorry, OP. I hope your dad does not let her isolate him from your family. It does sound like that is what her long game is.", "OP, my family does this for me too, I am loaded with whatever food I love when I'm home, and can eat as much of it as I like. It's also my home when I'm there!\n\nJanet is just plain wrong in saying it's her house, her rules. It was a shared space that belonged to everyone that she moved into 5 years back. Sure, if you were a minor, she could have rules around your safety, but not rules that limit your access / comfort in your own space.\n\nNow, of course, it IS her house but to treat you like this is horrible. Yes, it's polite to ask before you take food from the freezer at a random stranger's house but not at your freaking parents' house that you visit once in a blue moon. \n\nIf I were you, I would straight up ignore all these rules and let her melt down as much as she wants, till she realizes that these rules are unreasonable and untenable. Alternately, I would go NC with the whole family, but I can see why you'd worry about doing that because isolating your dad seems to be part of her abusive game plan.", "She didn't have step kids either. OP was 24 when his mom died and has never even referred to her as his stepmother in this post. It doesn't sound like they think of each other as family.", "Oh 100 perfuckingcent", "The Dad does not own the house but he pays half the expenses and it is his home. I am sorry if in your family, the very normal things OP did are not ok, in most families, they would be.", "Jeez! I'm sorry they went through that!", "true", "INFO: have you ever had serious conversation with your dad about this relationship and everything that is happening? This woman is creating a riff in his relationship with his daughters and grandkids. Even ask him \"do you think mom would be happy with this situation?\".\n\nHe didn't even have time to grief \ud83d\ude14.  He was probably so overwhelmed after your mom died that he let his guard down and let this woman in to fill the void he was filling. Could you go with your dad to some family therapy? NTA, anyway.", "Yeah, that's just the tip of the iceberg with my stepgrandmother. Her lore will go down in my family history as infamy. I hate that there are more people like her out there.", "Wow! I did not know this about widowers being unicorns \ud83d\ude2cbut enlightening for me, as it\u2019s happened only recently, though I talk with trusted friends & wear my wife\u2019s jewelry (necklace, rings, bracelets) conspicuously \u2026", "My dad and new step-mother's dynamic is very like this and I found this comment very validating, thank you!", "My dad and new step-mother's dynamic is very like this and I found this comment very validating, thank you!", "Except it is. Very common for widowers to remarry  VERY quickly. Google it yourself if you don't believe me and everyone else. It's a common and we documented phenomenon. Just because you say otherwise doesn't make it change."]}
