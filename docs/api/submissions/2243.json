My dad (61) started dating our neighbour Janet (58h) 6 months later; she was a neighbour and casual family friend. It would have been fine, but I was still living at home and they were spending their time together openly cuddling at our home. It crossed my boundaries. The boundaries kept being crossed - my dad and I were going to visit my sisters family in the UK for the first Christmas without my mom. Who comes? Janet. My dad and Janet make the trip a romantic vacation about them. \n\n10 months after my mom died, Janet fully moves in. Suddenly, I\u2019m not allowed to watch television or use the microwave past 9 pm (when she goes to bed) and I\u2019m called disrespectful and not normal for doing what I had been doing my whole life.  I struggle with insomnia and am a night owl. It\u2019s never been an issue before. I move out ASAP. I do not receive financial support, which is fine. \n\nFlash forward to now. My dad and her have moved to the country 3 hours away. It is her house but they split the cost. It\u2019s weird going over - no pictures of my mom up; belongings from my childhood home (things my mom picked out) all over the house. My moms ashes are in the basement, but I need to ask permission to go down there. \nWhen visiting, I\u2019m not allowed to use the laundry machine - it broke one time after I visited and I\u2019m blamed, despite being 29 and having done my own laundry forever. \n\nLast week i visited. Janet made my favourite meal, GF lasagna, which was kind. There are six slices left over and i see my dad put them in the freezer. It\u2019s 9:30 and I\u2019m hungry - I go to the fridge to get a slice of lasagna. It\u2019s sadly frozen and it\u2019s too late to microwave, so I move one slice of lasagna from the freezer to the fridge for tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t typically do this with their other frozen meals, but this was made for me and I know my dad would want m to eat it. \n\nThe following morning, Janet confronts me. \u201cI saw you moved a slice of lasagna from the freezer and moved it to the fridge. You need to ask before you take something from the fridge. This is our food and I manage a household.\u201d\n\nI shut down. A few minutes later, I freak out to my dad - Im livid; im crying. I tell him coming here is difficult enough already and that what she said implied I was not a welcome guest or a member of the family, and as a 29 year old  adult, I shouldn\u2019t be controlled in this way. He simply says \u201cshe never had kids, so she doesn\u2019t get it. She gets mad at me if I eat late as well\u201d. My dad tells her he will be spending the day with me outside the house; I didn\u2019t request it but it was a nice gesture and we have a nice day. \n\nJanet tries to patch things up at nice but essentially just calls me dramatic, that she never ate without permission growing up, and tells me it\u2019s her house her rules. The next morning, I inform my dad I\u2019m happy to visit again, but I\u2019ll be staying in a hotel in future bc it\u2019s just too difficult. I let him know he is always welcome to stay with me. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668373524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yue7kj/aita_for_being_upset_i_need_to_ask_permission_for/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are so many marinara-covered flags it puts the Lasagna to shame. You're NTA OP. Your dad needs to run, and Janet needs therapy.", "NTA. Nevermind how Janet grew up or manages her house. She knows damned well that asking for permission to open the fridge, or eat anything at all while visiting is absurd. She's making you unwelcome because she doesn't want you there. Your dad lives with her, not you, so of course he's going to take her side, every time. You did well to propose staying in a hotel for future visits. Frankly I think that's overgenerous. I'd go LC or NC & give Janet (& your dad 'cause what she wants is what he wants) what she wants.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is between a rock and a hard place but should be supporting you more. His wife may not have kids or understand, but being super petty is not the way to learn.", "NTA you arent trying to change the rules of the house (even though that makes the most sense since this woman is just utterly unreasonable) you found a very reasonable compromise, you visit but stay at a hotel\n\nYour father has shown you a lot of disrespect though ever since your mother died, he AND she are AH", "NTA, absolutely. There are some things here that might be. . .bad judgment or misunderstanding on her part, or just the difficulties of life with a remarried widowed parent (the lack of pictures, for example), but the idea that you are neither a family member nor a \"welcome guest\" is horrible. As a lifelong reader of Miss Manners, I'm pretty sure she would say there is NO category of guests to your home it is acceptable to treat that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I would ask if you can take your mother's ashes out of the home (you can figure out with your siblings if there is a better solution), and then go ahead with your plan to stay in a hotel, and only see your father and interact with Janet minimally. Frankly, a lot of people would want to distance themselves from their father for permitting this kind of treatment, and I think they would be justified. (But of course, continuing a relationship with your father is totally up to you.)", "NTA\n\nIf your moms ashes are in the basement, ask your dad for them along with any of her stuff as mementos.", "NTA. Honestly you're handling this overall pretty maturely. Kudos and sorry for your loss.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve done exactly the right thing by deciding to find other ways to spend time with your dad.", "Dad is enabling mistreatment, Janet TOTALLY knows what she's doing.   \n\n\nNTA- tell dad you're never coming again.", "NTA. Your father will always take her side. You offered a good compromise.", "NTA, Janet is TA! She jumped into your life and now makes you feel like you\u2019re an annoying unwanted guest and she even did that when she moved into YOUR house. Your dad is also TA for letting her dictate all the rules and not standing up for you. I\u2019d be staying in a hotel too or I\u2019d bring my own food, she\u2019s so rude!", "NTA.\n\nBeing a good host means taking care of guests' needs. That's especially true for family, and I'd say your father hasn't been treating you like family if you aren't allowed to visit your mother's ashes and eat when you're hungry. I'm sorry to hear that they're so unkind toward you.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're having to go through this.\n\nI'm glad your dad spent the day with you but he needs to be speaking to Janet about this and teaching her how to consider others. It's no excuse that she hasn't had children, she should know to male guests comfortable in her house - and you're family.\n\nSuch a grim situation and seems very odd with the ashes being in the basement and you having to ask permission to go there. Are you able to talk to your dad about all of this and see if he'll speak to her?", "Nta. I'm 26 and if I go visit my parents and get hungry I eat food out of the fridge and pantry like its my own house. My partner does this at his parents house too. Its normal I thought. My parents try to force food on me usually.", "NTA.  Getting a hotel room is a good plan.", "NTA. Janet doesn't sound like someone many people would want to live with. (how loud or disruptive is a microwave use at night, anyway?? good grief)", "NTA\n\nJanet is off her rocker and a complete control freak.\n\nPlease stay in contact with your dad and make sure his finances are secure. Visit with him as much as possible without her presence. She could be trying to isolate him. Then next thing you know he falls ill and passes and she inherits his assets and is an insurance beneficiary.", "I\u2019m torn on this one. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, then I think you should follow the house rules\u2014even if they\u2019re silly. \n\nAs someone who experienced food scarcity and grew up with some weird food rules, I can see her side. \n\nBut I can see yours too. You\u2019re an adult. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for choosing not to stay there when you visit. I always get a hotel room when I go \u201chome\u201d.\n\nSo I\u2019m going with NTA.", "I would say NTA, but barely. The appropriate response to \"You need to ask for permission before you take something from the fridge\" would be \"ok, sorry, won't happen again!\" It's also just the polite thing to do before you take something out of someone's freezer to eat, even family members. You don't live there, and them putting it in the freezer implies they would be eating at a later date. I know 100% my mom would give me anything out of her fridge, but if I went to visit I would still politely ask to take anything from it to eat. \n\nIt seems like you are more upset at the whole situation and the relationship between her and your dad, and this probably has nothing to do with the lasagna, so the real answer is you are NTA for having these strong feelings about your dad's relationship.", "NTA.  Your dad's going to take her side because he doesn't want to be alone.  Never stay in their home again, and never eat in her house again.  She's lost that privilege of hosting you.  Sad that her controlling neurosis is more important to her than your father's happiness at seeing you, but then, she doesn't want him to see you.  I'd have him visit you at a hotel...without her.  If he brings her, leave the meeting.", "It's their house.", "NTA but you are 29 yrs old. Time to leave that nest and move out to your own place. Your father will always side with his new partner and you are too old to throw temper tantrums when these stupid rules come up. They'll always be a new stupid rule.
