My dad (61) started dating our neighbour Janet (58h) 6 months later; she was a neighbour and casual family friend. It would have been fine, but I was still living at home and they were spending their time together openly cuddling at our home. It crossed my boundaries. The boundaries kept being crossed - my dad and I were going to visit my sisters family in the UK for the first Christmas without my mom. Who comes? Janet. My dad and Janet make the trip a romantic vacation about them. \n\n10 months after my mom died, Janet fully moves in. Suddenly, I\u2019m not allowed to watch television or use the microwave past 9 pm (when she goes to bed) and I\u2019m called disrespectful and not normal for doing what I had been doing my whole life.  I struggle with insomnia and am a night owl. It\u2019s never been an issue before. I move out ASAP. I do not receive financial support, which is fine. \n\nFlash forward to now. My dad and her have moved to the country 3 hours away. It is her house but they split the cost. It\u2019s weird going over - no pictures of my mom up; belongings from my childhood home (things my mom picked out) all over the house. My moms ashes are in the basement, but I need to ask permission to go down there. \nWhen visiting, I\u2019m not allowed to use the laundry machine - it broke one time after I visited and I\u2019m blamed, despite being 29 and having done my own laundry forever. \n\nLast week i visited. Janet made my favourite meal, GF lasagna, which was kind. There are six slices left over and i see my dad put them in the freezer. It\u2019s 9:30 and I\u2019m hungry - I go to the fridge to get a slice of lasagna. It\u2019s sadly frozen and it\u2019s too late to microwave, so I move one slice of lasagna from the freezer to the fridge for tomorrow. I wouldn\u2019t typically do this with their other frozen meals, but this was made for me and I know my dad would want m to eat it. \n\nThe following morning, Janet confronts me. \u201cI saw you moved a slice of lasagna from the freezer and moved it to the fridge. You need to ask before you take something from the fridge. This is our food and I manage a household.\u201d\n\nI shut down. A few minutes later, I freak out to my dad - Im livid; im crying. I tell him coming here is difficult enough already and that what she said implied I was not a welcome guest or a member of the family, and as a 29 year old  adult, I shouldn\u2019t be controlled in this way. He simply says \u201cshe never had kids, so she doesn\u2019t get it. She gets mad at me if I eat late as well\u201d. My dad tells her he will be spending the day with me outside the house; I didn\u2019t request it but it was a nice gesture and we have a nice day. \n\nJanet tries to patch things up at nice but essentially just calls me dramatic, that she never ate without permission growing up, and tells me it\u2019s her house her rules. The next morning, I inform my dad I\u2019m happy to visit again, but I\u2019ll be staying in a hotel in future bc it\u2019s just too difficult. I let him know he is always welcome to stay with me. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668373524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yue7kj/aita_for_being_upset_i_need_to_ask_permission_for/", "score": 1120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knows damned well that asking for permission to open the fridge, or eat anything at all while visiting is absurd. She's making you unwelcome because she doesn't want you there. Your dad lives with her, not you, so of course he's going to take her side, every time. You did well to propose staying in a hotel for future visits. Frankly I think that's overgenerous. I'd go LC or NC & give Janet (& your dad 'cause what she wants is what he wants) what she wants.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is between a rock and a hard place but should be supporting you more. His wife may not have kids or understand, but being super petty is not the way to learn.", "NTA you arent trying to change the rules of the house (even though that makes the most sense since this woman is just utterly unreasonable) you found a very reasonable compromise, you visit but stay at a hotel\n\nYour father has shown you a lot of disrespect though ever since your mother died, he AND she are AH", "NTA, absolutely. There are some things here that might be. . .bad judgment or misunderstanding on her part, or just the difficulties of life with a remarried widowed parent (the lack of pictures, for example), but the idea that you are neither a family member nor a \"welcome guest\" is horrible. As a lifelong reader of Miss Manners, I'm pretty sure she would say there is NO category of guests to your home it is acceptable to treat that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I would ask if you can take your mother's ashes out of the home (you can figure out with your siblings if there is a better solution), and then go ahead with your plan to stay in a hotel, and only see your father and interact with Janet minimally. Frankly, a lot of people would want to distance themselves from their father for permitting this kind of treatment, and I think they would be justified. (But of course, continuing a relationship with your father is totally up to you.)", "NTA\n\nIf your moms ashes are in the basement, ask your dad for them along with any of her stuff as mementos.", "NTA. Honestly you're handling this overall pretty maturely. Kudos and sorry for your loss.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019ve done exactly the right thing by deciding to find other ways to spend time with your dad.", "Dad is enabling mistreatment, Janet TOTALLY knows what she's doing.   \n\n\nNTA- tell dad you're never coming again.", "NTA. Your father will always take her side. You offered a good compromise.", "NTA, Janet is TA! She jumped into your life and now makes you feel like you\u2019re an annoying unwanted guest and she even did that when she moved into YOUR house. Your dad is also TA for letting her dictate all the rules and not standing up for you. I\u2019d be staying in a hotel too or I\u2019d bring my own food, she\u2019s so rude!", "NTA.\n\nBeing a good host means taking care of guests' needs. That's especially true for family, and I'd say your father hasn't been treating you like family if you aren't allowed to visit your mother's ashes and eat when you're hungry. I'm sorry to hear that they're so unkind toward you.", "NTA and I'm sorry you're having to go through this.\n\nI'm glad your dad spent the day with you but he needs to be speaking to Janet about this and teaching her how to consider others. It's no excuse that she hasn't had children, she should know to male guests comfortable in her house - and you're family.\n\nSuch a grim situation and seems very odd with the ashes being in the basement and you having to ask permission to go there. Are you able to talk to your dad about all of this and see if he'll speak to her?", "Nta. I'm 26 and if I go visit my parents and get hungry I eat food out of the fridge and pantry like its my own house. My partner does this at his parents house too. Its normal I thought. My parents try to force food on me usually.", "NTA.  Getting a hotel room is a good plan.", "NTA. Janet doesn't sound like someone many people would want to live with. (how loud or disruptive is a microwave use at night, anyway?? good grief)", "NTA\n\nJanet is off her rocker and a complete control freak.\n\nPlease stay in contact with your dad and make sure his finances are secure.

Then next thing you know he falls ill and passes and she inherits his assets and is an insurance beneficiary.", "I\u2019m torn on this one. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, then I think you should follow the house rules\u2014even if they\u2019re silly. \n\nAs someone who experienced food scarcity and grew up with some weird food rules, I can see her side. \n\nBut I can see yours too. You\u2019re an adult. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for choosing not to stay there when you visit. I always get a hotel room when I go \u201chome\u201d.\n\nSo I\u2019m going with NTA.", "I would say NTA, but barely. The appropriate response to \"You need to ask for permission before you take something from the fridge\" would be \"ok, sorry, won't happen again!\" It's also just the polite thing to do before you take something out of someone's freezer to eat, even family members. You don't live there, and them putting it in the freezer implies they would be eating at a later date. I know 100% my mom would give me anything out of her fridge, but if I went to visit I would still politely ask to take anything from it to eat. \n\nIt seems like you are more upset at the whole situation and the relationship between her and your dad, and this probably has nothing to do with the lasagna, so the real answer is you are NTA for having these strong feelings about your dad's relationship.", "NTA.  Your dad's going to take her side because he doesn't want to be alone.  Never stay in their home again, and never eat in her house again.  She's lost that privilege of hosting you.  Sad that her controlling neurosis is more important to her than your father's happiness at seeing you, but then, she doesn't want him to see you.  I'd have him visit you at a hotel...without her.  If he brings her, leave the meeting.", "It's their house.", "NTA but you are 29 yrs old. Time to leave that nest and move out to your own place. Your father will always side with his new partner and you are too old to throw temper tantrums when these stupid rules come up. They'll always be a new stupid rule.

The meal was made to celebrate my visiting. I\u2019ve visited many times and not eaten their frozen meals bc I knew to ask. The issue is not that she made the request, it was the follow up comments explaining why I needed to ask - the explanations i shouldn\u2019t feel at home where my dad lives.

Your father did not see it for what it was, and unfortunately, whether they have children or not, this is ridiculously common with stepmothers. They are very controlling, and almost seem to purposely push away and existing children, if not push for their own offspring to get all the attention. As much as I can tell this is a real problem, I can't think of much else to do besides have a talk with your dad, and if he doesn't come to realize what's happened, simply reduce the amount of contact you have.\n\nETA: I felt the need to clarify something stated above. This is not to say all stepmothers are controlling and manipulative. It is just common to see amongst women who become stepmothers.

His eyes were wide open.\n\nHe is willing to excuse her controlling, unwelcoming behavior with his adult child because that's the easiest thing for him to do.\n\nHe is equally at fault here.

When he was super sick she had him signing titles for snowmobiles, ATVs, and a couple cars over to herself. Then she went online and requested paperwork to take withdrawals from his 401k. It was a nightmare. Daughter was able to stop most of it before he died. We gave her notice to leave his house on the day he died. We had an army of his friends monitor her every move on moving day. The final straw was gf\u2019s daughter tried to take his dog. My daughter had to fight her in small claims court over the dog", "I am so sorry this happened to you. What a witch.", "I mean, if one of my parents died, I would expect for their friend to at least wait for the body to be cold before jumping into bed with their spouse. Janet sounds pretty desperate here.", "Hi Janet.\nWow. \ud83d\ude1f", "Just fyi, the term you're looking for is \"widower.\"", "Agree!  FIL\u2019s wife moved in on him 2 months after MIL died.", "But is she  a lawyer herself, and if she is, licensed to practice in the state or region your dad and Janet live in? I would ensure that you have a  attorney that is there near the same place your dad lives that is kept in the loop who knows exactly what is happening in regards to both of their wills, so everyone inheritance and estates are exactly what's what.", "You might want to talk to your dad about seeing an attorney who\u2019s not your sister, namely one who specializes in estate law. Janet\u2019s going to take everything she can get her hands on if your dad passes first.", "Having a sister with a law degree is not the same as having a properly executed will. And even then, there can be a lot of surprises in a will when it's too late to do anything about it.", "depends on jurisdiction OP i think is from the UK , I am in Canada different parts of Canada have different laws  .", "Thank you.", "I'm so sorry. I feel bad for your daughter - even having to fight for her father's dog, \n\nSome people are vultures. All they care about are money and possessions. Taking advantage of someone's illness or vulnerability to enrich oneself at the expense of others is reprehensible. It sounds like your late ex's gf and my evil stepmother were two of a kind.", "I'm not even going to argue with that and that would be a valid issue. But when a widow enters a new relationship and moves in with the new relationship there's no way that new SO is going to want the dead SO's picture in their face throughout their home regardless of the circumstances. I find it super bizarre that THIS is what bothers OP so much that they keep bringing it up.", "Where is his empathy for his father?", "Some men don't want to be alone. He wanted someone to see to his creature comforts and he got one. End of story.", "No I agree. I\u2019m more saying - I trust that she will know what to do, who to hire, and is actively thinking about these things. When she visited last summer with her kids, she wasn\u2019t even allowed to stay at the house and Janet said her and the kids were too loud. They had to get an Airbnb. She had to flat out tell my dad that she and the kids are a zoo, and they needed to accept it or she won\u2019t be visiting from Europe again.", "I think if it was me, it would be the fact that they do want all the art work and decor the deceased picked out around, but no other sign of her. It's kinda Single White Female level shit on Janet's part.", "There's no indication that he has no empathy for his father anywhere in this post, but it does show a major lack of empathy and consideration from his father in regards to the actions he took after his wife died. You're being rude, accusatory, and over all a jack ass. I hope you grow the fuck up.", "My mum's father had the same agreement. Doesn't change what happened after his death. Wills are able to be contested.", "Eh, i don't really think so. I mean do we really know if it was her and only her with the artwork? When she died it became dads artwork and he likely was involved in the purchase on some level anyways. I mean if you start on that path where does it end? Should he get rid of the sweater she bought him? The suitcases she picked out? That favorite pan he brought because she liked it too? Nobody is saying he should erase all trace of her but i don't think it's unreasonable that a new SO isn't going to want pictures of the dead SO all around the house."]}
