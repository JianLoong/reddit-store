My parents and I have had a challenging one forever.\n\nThe Context:\nMy brother has been in a relationship with a woman for the past 4 years (F28). She is from a different, non-privileged background and had a child at 18. I love this woman like a sister and accept her wholeheartedly. My parents are a different story - they saw a different woman for my brother. They have some problematic beliefs and can be pretty classist. They were also highly controlling in their parenting style - I broke the cycle through years of conflict, but my brother always fell in line and even as an adult is still terrified of disappointing them. Maybe that\u2019s why he waited over a year to tell them about his GF and hadn\u2019t told them about the child until this New Years.\n\nMy mom got in touch last year to vent about GF - calling her a gold digger, saying all this mean stuff about how she \u201cconducted herself\u201d when she was staying with us. I tried to steer her in the right direction, and tell her that she might not like GF, but we all had to be respect my brothers choice and his partner. I thought we agreed on that.\n\nThe Issue:\nOver the holidays, my brother went home to my parents alone to \u201cbreak the news\u201d (finally) that his GF has a child. The result was disastrous - Mom and Dad both starting crying and screaming. They said she wasn\u2019t \u201ccompatible\u201d and told him they had noticed his mental health decline since being with her. My brother conveyed all of this to me and his GF. She was devastated. My parents almost immediately attempted to triangulate me in, and I set a boundary that I didn\u2019t want to talk about my adult brother\u2019s love life anymore. That really set them off and my dad sent me and my brother a looooooooong email calling brother \u201cdeceitful\u201d and \u201ccowardly\u201d and accusing me of putting them through hell will my terrible life choices (I\u2019m a successful self-employed adult in a healthy relationship). He was particularly vitriolic toward me, and insulted me quite a bit in the email.\n\nCut to: the cycle of conflict is over for them and they want to get past it now.

I have said I need an acknowledgment of the hurt their email caused before I can move on. I\u2019m not fully comfortable talking over the phone because they are so emotionally reactive.

Kudos!\n\n \nI actually think it is really important that every time they try to move on without acknowledgement, you repeat your request.  All injuries need repair and being accountable for one\u2019s actions & words are the major part of the repair.   \n\nI would say though, that it seems unlikely they will be able to do it. It would require them to be secure enough to be vulnerable and acknowledge fault. But you asking for the acknowledgment is really for you - you\u2019re doing the hard part of advocating for yourself, being true to your own experience and being vulnerable.  I see the work you\u2019re doing.  \n\nMoving forward - your brother and his GF are much more likely to be able to have a healthy relationship with you. Turn your attention there.  If he and you can be on the same page on how to engage w your parents (United front) it will increase any possibility of them eventually changing.  Perhaps bro is too insecure for that and if so, just keep trying to engage him and model what you\u2019d like in your relationship w him.  Also, being transparent w him about what your parents try to do to keep you two siloed will shine a light on their bad behavior (they will def get worse if you two tow the same line bc they\u2019ll feel their grip slipping).  Talking about things openly undermines abuser\u2019s tactics. They can\u2019t hide.", "NTA\n\nPart of moving on in a healthy way is acknowledging the hurt that they have caused. If they don't want to do that, they don't want to move on, they want to rug sweep.", "NTA. They don\u2019t get to be bigoted and emotionally abuse the both of you and then just act like nothing happened to keep you in their lives. Keep your boundaries, your request for acknowledgment is even incredibly generous. You probably should be demanding that they apologize before speaking to them again, but if you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary that\u2019s up to you. If they can\u2019t even do that bare minimum, then they don\u2019t deserve to be involved in your lives.", "What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?", "NTA - normally I would say \"just go no contact with these crazies\" but damn, I'd probably feel the need to stay right in between them and your brother to protect him from the bullshit. Is that the mentally healthy thing to do? IDK! Therapy for everyone!", "NTA read up on narcissistic parents and see if they fit. If they do read ip on how to handle them. You are not responsible for their feelings.", "abusive vulgar people want a blessing for their unacceptable behavior?\n\nlet them rot\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnta\n\nand do not give in.\n\njust tell them, that if they feel responsible for your and your brother's happiness, then the best thing they can do, is to stay out of your lives, that way it will actually be a happier life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit, typo", "NTA Abusers are like that.   They do the dirty, then expect you to forgive them.  While you can't shield your brother, shield yourself.  Don't negotiate.  Just cut them off.", "NTA.  You and your brother may be interested in reading Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.", "NTA but the truth is they have nothing to offer you. There's literally no point other than your own trauma to those people in your life. They've always hung around you and your brother's necks and it sounds terrible.\n\n\nA parent shouldn't want to cast such a shadow over their children into adulthood. I don't see why you don't go NC other than that pesky \"but parents\".\n\n\nBut we all have to decide when we have self-respect. Is there really no point when the emotional vampires are to be banished? No line they could not cross that wouldn't get forgiveness?\n\n\nThere are people that are just black holes of unhappiness who will always bring drama to anyone they touch.", "NTA Maybe you should let them know that you'll be \u201cunburdening [yourself] from feeling responsible for [their] happiness\u201d when its eventually time to leave them in a nursing home and handle end of life care.", "NTA, you and your brother should take a good look at the subreddit r/raisedbynarcissists", "NTA. Holy crap. I\u2019d be going no contact and encouraging my brother to do the same. \nI\u2019m shocked either of you would want anything to do with abusive people like that, parents or not. \nAnd the poor kid that\u2019s caught up in this, think of your parents reactions when they meet the child. Not ok!", "NTA - \n\nyou aren't obligated to be \"healed\" just because they are. They've ensured their needs are met, and are now ready to \"move on\".\n\nYou have stated what you feel you need to heal and move on. You don't have any obligation to do anything else until you have that. It's not their right to dictate your needs, and all the boundaries of the relationship. It's a 2-way street.\n\nPersonally, I would respond to any call/message with \"I've told you what I need to move on. Are you saying you're willing to provide that?\" And if they aren't, end the conversation.\n\nEventually, either they will acknowledge your feelings, or they won't. Either way it's their choice. You are NTA.", "NTA, good job standing up for yourself", "NTA - stick to your guns! They don't get to bash you and then pretend it didn't happen. That's ridiculous. The boundary you're setting is healthy and completely reasonable.", "NTA, but they sound like terrible, controlling, unhealthy people so idk why you care to have a relationship with them."]}
