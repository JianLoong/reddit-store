It's common in law enforcement background checks to advise candidates that the offer is on hold until they move in with someone who doesn't have a criminal background.\n\nI honestly think you don't even need to call back, and it's certainly not in your best interest to do so. Explain to your roommate that they are vetting you, not him, and you don't consent. Tell him to find someone to live with who doesn't have a criminal record. None of this is your fault, and talking to that officer further will not fix their problem. \n\nNAH, because neither of you clearly understood what was happening here when the officer asked for your contact information.", "NTA. dont call them back. cops are never up to any good.", "This was a pretty negative experience and just affirms my distrust of cops, so i will not be calling them back.  \n\nThe cop who called me was rude, unprofessional and intrusive.  I have no wish to speak with anyone from that department if someone like that was promoted to detective.", "I just assumed i would be asking questions about my friend, \n\nlike did he do illegal stuff while your roommate, general character questions and stuff like that.  \n\nBut the first question was \"tell me about the arrests when you were in college\"", "yeah, us based", "Yes, my next door neighbor applied to be a cop and they interviewed me. I had to give my name, address and phone number, and how long I had known him, but those were the only personal questions they asked of me.\n\nAnd they didn\u2019t ask questions about my neighbors sex life, either!

As much as it sucks for your former roomie that was unnecessarily intrusive and not the point of being a reference.\n\nI would HIGHLY encourage you to contact the agency and let them know wtf happened during your interview because I can't see any point of you being asked those questions.", "Well then the other person they do it to can go make a complaint. Your response is completely ignorant and disregards that somebody does not have to put themselves in an uncomfortable situation if they don\u2019t need to. \n\nIt\u2019s not op\u2019s responsibility to make sure the police department doesn\u2019t harass anybody. Shame on you.", "Because cops/departments in the usa have never been known to personally retaliate against private citizens making complaints with absolutely no accountability when they abuse there power!", "This is unbelievably naive.

I'm guessing he thought my roomie was potentially involved in my arrests somehow since it was in college when we lived together.  \nlike did he do illegal stuff while your roommate, general character questions and stuff like that.  \nBut the first question was \"tell me about the arrests when you were in college\"", "Everyone pushing for you to challenge cops has no idea what it\u2019s like, especially in certain areas for some people. Nothing would happen to the cop anyways lol. You would need a lawsuit for that\u2026and even then. Don\u2019t let the ignorant chronic onliners get to you", "You're not wrong. Protect yourself. We both know an anonymous report won't actually protect you. Your instincts are correct here and tbh, you may want to jettison the friend if he wants to be a cop. They're not safe people, unfortunately. He'll either get a job and realize how corrupt it is and leave, or he'll become corrupt himself.", "So file an anonymous complaint.", "Yea fuck that, unless it has to do with illegal activity (Hence why I asked US based) then he doesn't need to be in your business like that. I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "Agreed. My MIL was stalked by a cop and no matter how many times she tried to resolve the issue through \"proper\" channels, she was ignored, gaslit, and given excuse after excuse. We are EXTREMELY lucky that the guy got bored or found a different victim to obsess over or some other reason and stopped after about a year.\n\nIf I were OP, I'd be changing my number, moving, and yeeting that friend so far out of my life that I'd be pretending not to know them if I ran into them in the streets."]}
