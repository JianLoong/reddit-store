It's common in law enforcement background checks to advise candidates that the offer is on hold until they move in with someone who doesn't have a criminal background.\n\nI honestly think you don't even need to call back, and it's certainly not in your best interest to do so. Explain to your roommate that they are vetting you, not him, and you don't consent. Tell him to find someone to live with who doesn't have a criminal record. None of this is your fault, and talking to that officer further will not fix their problem. \n\nNAH, because neither of you clearly understood what was happening here when the officer asked for your contact information.", "NTA. dont call them back. cops are never up to any good.", "This was a pretty negative experience and just affirms my distrust of cops, so i will not be calling them back.  \n\nThe cop who called me was rude, unprofessional and intrusive.  I have no wish to speak with anyone from that department if someone like that was promoted to detective.", "I just assumed i would be asking questions about my friend, \n\nlike did he do illegal stuff while your roommate, general character questions and stuff like that.  \n\nBut the first question was \"tell me about the arrests when you were in college\"", "yeah, us based", "Yes, my next door neighbor applied to be a cop and they interviewed me. I had to give my name, address and phone number, and how long I had known him, but those were the only personal questions they asked of me.\n\nAnd they didn\u2019t ask questions about my neighbors sex life, either!

As much as it sucks for your former roomie that was unnecessarily intrusive and not the point of being a reference.\n\nI would HIGHLY encourage you to contact the agency and let them know wtf happened during your interview because I can't see any point of you being asked those questions.", "Well then the other person they do it to can go make a complaint. Your response is completely ignorant and disregards that somebody does not have to put themselves in an uncomfortable situation if they don\u2019t need to. \n\nIt\u2019s not op\u2019s responsibility to make sure the police department doesn\u2019t harass anybody. Shame on you.", "Because cops/departments in the usa have never been known to personally retaliate against private citizens making complaints with absolutely no accountability when they abuse there power!", "This is unbelievably naive. Like off the charts.", "I just assumed i would be asking questions about my friend,\n\nI'm happy to answer and and all questions he wants to know about roomie, and i will answer them honestly.  however beside my first and last name, i will not delve into personal life details.  I'm guessing he thought my roomie was potentially involved in my arrests somehow since it was in college when we lived together.  \nlike did he do illegal stuff while your roommate, general character questions and stuff like that.  \nBut the first question was \"tell me about the arrests when you were in college\"", "Everyone pushing for you to challenge cops has no idea what it\u2019s like, especially in certain areas for some people. Nothing would happen to the cop anyways lol. You would need a lawsuit for that\u2026and even then. Don\u2019t let the ignorant chronic onliners get to you", "You're not wrong. Protect yourself. We both know an anonymous report won't actually protect you. Your instincts are correct here and tbh, you may want to jettison the friend if he wants to be a cop. They're not safe people, unfortunately. He'll either get a job and realize how corrupt it is and leave, or he'll become corrupt himself.", "So file an anonymous complaint.", "Yea fuck that, unless it has to do with illegal activity (Hence why I asked US based) then he doesn't need to be in your business like that. I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "Agreed. My MIL was stalked by a cop and no matter how many times she tried to resolve the issue through \"proper\" channels, she was ignored, gaslit, and given excuse after excuse. We are EXTREMELY lucky that the guy got bored or found a different victim to obsess over or some other reason and stopped after about a year.\n\nIf I were OP, I'd be changing my number, moving, and yeeting that friend so far out of my life that I'd be pretending not to know them if I ran into them in the streets.", "NTA\n\nHow incredibly vile!", "Discrimination is illegal in the hiring process. Even though the OP is not the one getting the job, I think, he can still sue. Any good lawyer will probably take this case on a contingency basis.", "YTA", "I don't think this is real. Just police bashing.", "NTA", "NTA, that officer was way out of line. Now, im not on the field, but im pretty sure your roomie's and your's sexual history shouldnt even be adressed as it wouldnt affect his job performance, also, he was threatening you to answer invasive and unrelated questions, that might be illegal.", "Not only are you not the asshole, but that cop was way out of line! Get him or her reported!", "NTA, I have provided background check references for two friends. One for the FBI, and one for the police force. During neither interview was I asked anything about my personal life; it was all about the person in question. Can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to make a complaint either, for fear of retaliation.", "Why would he want to work for an agency like that?  Absolutely nta", "Yep, did it with the military and all they asked were questions about me. I think the only personal question that was asked was what their relationship was to me.", "This is good advice for OPs roommate IF the roommate still wants to work for these people", "I wonder if he wanted to threaten op to do sexual favors for him.", "OP doesn't live with the guy", "Why?", "Are you sure that the person who called was a LEO? Such agencies often hire third-party companies to conduct background checks. Either way, you should definitely contact the agency and complain about the unprofessional behavior. It doesn't matter if your call doesn't make a difference. If no one ever speaks up, nothing will change. If you call, and more people call and there is a chain of complaints, it's much harder to ignore.", "Im with you on this one, the more i hear other's experiences with cops, the more im scared of them", "Spoken like someone who's never been in a position of weakness in front of a power hungry man in blue. \n\nCause he probably will anyway considering cops historically protect each other. Plus they want to \"keep a certain sort\" out of the academy in the first place. And this is just the start if they already know the applicant is gay as well. Roomie is probably safer not taking this job anyway. \n\nPlus he'd need to sue to get any actual traction. And that would probably open up him and his former roomie as well as people connected to them to the loveliness that is police retaliation.", "someone else's actions are not OP's fault\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Fuck that. You cannot blame a future abuse on a past victim. The only person responsible is the perpetrator.", "What makes you think the supervisor or whoever he reports to wouldn't have his back and be part of this?", "Right ? Like, their buddies probably agree or are tolerant of that behavior. Good cops get kicked out for reporting", "You aren't the problem, but refusing to engage with it through the right avenues is part of what makes the problem worse. I don't blame you at all, but you should recognize that.", "Yeah tbh i highly doubt the supervisor is any less homophobic!"]}
