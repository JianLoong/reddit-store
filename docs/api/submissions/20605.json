And not everyone is willing to. But just that the reality of change is that it's not easy you know?) But like beyond just personally not wanting to have to go through those steps because of how harm doing that could theoretically be- police unions tend to be super fucking strong. Like police have done worse than ask invasive questions and have still stayed police officers. It takes a lot to get other police to actually agree someone did something bad enough to get them fired or to keep them fired. Even demotions can be tricky.
