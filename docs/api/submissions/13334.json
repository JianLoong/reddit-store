{"id": 13334, "submission_id": "123wj95", "title": "AITA for insisting to be in the delivery room?", "selftext": "EDIT: Moving this to the top so everyone can see. This is my final edit and after this I will no longer be responding to any comments... but I think I'm sort of TA here. For clarification, my wife is under the full belief that I barely did anything with her pregnancy, and this is the primary reason why she is letting her mother be in the delivery room. I was too invested in work, so I missed many classes she took, and many other experiences like the baby's first kick. I am an addicted workaholic, so I thought the birth of our baby could give me one wholesome moment in my life. She is allowing me to see the baby once the cord is cut, so she isn't dismissing me entirely. As for her MIL, I frankly do look down on her for being a teenage mother. I think she should've gotten an abortion and it's selfish to bring a child into the world without a father and stable income, but I digress. I will talk more with my wife about this recommend couples counseling. Also keep in mind that my wife is 7 months pregnant, so her hormones might be making her say funny stuff. Before anyone asks yes we should've discussed this MONTHS ago, but she intentionally avoided the topic everytime and kept saying, \"I'll think about it.\"\n\nOverall thank you for your judgements, NTAs and YTAs included.\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nMy (26m) wife (27f) and I are expecting our first child. Her mother has been incredibly invasive with the pregnancy and my wife lets her do it.\n\nMy wife and MIL have an extremely close relationship. They do everything together, reveal everything together, and talk to each-other about ANYTHING personal. It's probably because her mom was a teenage mom (got pregnant at 15) so I guess it's easier to treat her own daughter like her BFF.\n\nMy wife wants her mother to be in the delivery room. ONLY her. She doesn't want her father, or siblings, or her own husband. Just her mom and no one else. And it hurts because I have to accept the fact that she will always love her mom over me. I bet if I she had to choose between me and her mom falling off a cliff, she would rush to her mom.\n\nI tried talking to my wife and asking her that I want to be the only one in the room. It's my kid too and it's unfair to not see him be born. My wife told me that she's the one \"shitting from her vagina\" so she can choose whoever she wants. I asked why she wants her mom over so bad; she just said \"I was technically with my mom when she gave birth so I want her to be with me when I give birth.\" Which is the most stupid, childish reason.\n\nI honestly started to believe her mother forced the entire thing on her, just because she wanted to be included in everything. I texted my MIL telling her that her daughter is not her best friend, she is her daughter, and she should allow her daughter to include her husband in her life and the delivery room. She told me it was my wife's choice not hers and having sending laughing emojis going \"Are you jealous???\"\n\nIt pissed me off so I left her on read. My wife found out and told me I'm being a controlling dick about the whole thing and just to deal with it. She has no idea how hurtful this is for me. Am I overreacting?\n\nEDIT: For people who are saying that she has the entire say. Understand my perspective. I have helped create this baby, I have helped her through her pregnancies even though she always complained that I barely did anything, and I've tried my best. I know she's going to go through pain but hospitals are better than they used to be anyway; she will be fine.\n\nEDIT: Looking back, my previous edit was too harsh, so I'll take it back. Also for the people insisting that I should immediately divorce my wife, I'm not going to instantly jump to that conclusion. Maybe we could benefit from some counseling first.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1679943311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123wj95/aita_for_insisting_to_be_in_the_delivery_room/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dismiss your  wife's wishes in regards to her birthing plan because you don't agree with her reasoning. You dismiss your wife's ability to say no to her mother if she's uncomfortable because you don't understand her relationship so obviously your wife is being manipulated. How is she supposed to trust you to support her in a painful,  vulnerable,  terrifying experience if you dismiss her so easily when her choices aren't what you want? YTA\n\nEdit: OP shared some details in a comment about his wife's relationship with her mother:\n\n>They're just very close and tell eachother everything. Her mother visits once a week (she is 40 minutes away) on Mondays to have brunch with my wife. Mother hosted the baby shower and pretty much picked all of the decorations. Her mother also comes home whenever she has serious nausea and pain, which I can't go to because I'm very busy at work (I did buy her plenty of stuff to help her through it though).\n\nSo he's upset that she has a mother who is available and willing to take care of her when she's suffering from pain and nausea while her husband is too busy at work.  OP seems to think that because he bought food/meds to help, she shouldn't need her mother.", "About your edit : you helped make the baby, but you aren't the one going through contractions, having to push a 7 lbs baby out of a very small orifice of your body, facing risks of tearings, prolapse, pooping in public, etc. \n\nShe finds it more comforting to be going through all that with her mother than with you, so be it.\n\nBut childbirth is not a matter of who made the baby. It's a matter of who is physically giving birth on the table, their physical needs and their emotional needs. \n\nYTA, again. \n\n> I have helped her through her pregnancies even though she always complained that I barely did anything, and I've tried my best.\n\nWe have no idea what that means, we can't judge you on that. what is \"I helped her\" and why is it not enough? \n\nEDIT : I've seen your comments regarding your \"help\" and this is just not enough to \"buy things\". If this is your idea of comprehensive support, you are entirely mistaken. But it's not the point of the AITA. The point here is \"AITA for wanting to be there\", the answer is \"no. you're perfectly entitled to your feelings. But you're not entitled to press and be dismissive\".\n\nAlso, jealous because the MIL helped choose the baby shower decorations and not you? What? were you actively pushed from the organization committee?\n\n> hospitals are better than they used to be anyway; she will be fine.\n\nyou sound unaware and dismissive of what women go through in hospitals when they give birth. I'd rather not have you in my delivery room. \n\nIn first world countries, it still happens that women die in childbirth. Even in hospitals. Or go through life/health threatening situations all the time. \n\nIf this is how you treat childbirth, it might be why she doesn't want you at that very vulnerable and scary moment. It's very normal for pregnant women to want their mothers around when they give birth. They are scared and want the support of someone who went through it, someone who knows them, loves them and will fight/advocate for them. It does not seem you would advocate for your wife's wellbeing, if anything were to happen (I hope nothing happens). \n\nIn short, you don't get it and you don't realize you don't get it. I suggest you get more educated on the matter; it might help you understand your wife better.", "INFO: have you been attending classes with her? Like lamaze or meditation or prenatal classes of any kind? Have you been going to doctor appointments?", "YTA. 'hospitals are better than they used to be she'll be fine' and making her giving birth about you are EXACTLY why you not being in there makes sense. You clearly don't have an understanding on how dangerous giving birth is. How many things that could go wrong and how comfort levels matter. \n\nI'd have my mom in there too at that point. She gets to choose, because she's the one in the uncomfortable/dangerous/painful situation.\n\nYou're dismissive of her feelings right now. How can she trust you as a birth partner if you don't take her feelings seriously? That's literally one of the most important jobs of being a birth partner.", "INFO: Can you give more examples of your wife and mother's relationship? While close, nothing you have said has made the relationship seem bad. It is normal for someone other than the parents to host a bady shower and is normal for a grandma to be involved.", "YTA for how you're handling this. It's okay for you to be disappointed that you aren't in the room despite wanting to be. But you're trying to pathologize the fact that your wife has a healthy and loving relationship with her mom, something a lot of people don't have. What's wrong with her and her mom being best friends? She's known her way longer than you have.\n\nIf you're upset you're not in the delivery room, make it about you and your wife, not about your mother in law.

Is \"it's my kid too\" a say or a veto right? \"My wife wants A, I want B. It's my kid, so B should win\". Is your wife's job to push the baby out and shut up about what she wants?", "YTA\n\nWanting your mother there when you give birth is not \"stupid\" or \"childish.\"\n\nYou don't just want to be there, you want to control who else is there too, which pushes you completely into asshole territory.

It sounds like you barely did anything during her actual pregnancy, and you constantly shame your MIL for being a teenage parent.", "Well... sorry but for me, it's YTA. Giving birth is a really hard and traumatic process. If your wife doesn't want you in the delivery room... pretty sure it hides some bigger relationship issues than you think. Instead of trying to force her to change her birthing plan, you should be trying to figure out if she is too attached to your mom... or not enough to you.", "From your post, I understand why your wife doesn\u2019t want you in the room. All you say is me, me, me.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Especially with the edit. You try carrying a child for 9 months and then pushing it out of your body then we\u2019ll talk about what you are and aren\u2019t entitled to a say in.

This just sounds like she doesn't want you there and tbh, I kind of get it. Birth is still dangerous even in the modern day and age and it doesn't seem like you're taking that seriously at all.", "Maaaan, come on\u2026 you had me for a while. I absolutely despise the idea of being told I can\u2019t be there for the birth of my own children. But \u201cit hurts because I have to accept the fact that she will always love her mom over me.\u201d No shit bro, that\u2019s her mom. Why are you trying to compete? YTA", "You need to take a deep breath. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about you. You do not get to own somebody else\u2019s medical procedure.", "YTA. Not for wanting to be there, but for being so dismissive of your wife\u2019s feelings. Yes, I get that you don\u2019t like your MIL and look down on her, but your wife is going through the pregnancy and childbirth, and she deserves to have what she needs in order to feel comfortable.\n\nYou also say \u201cI know she\u2019s going to go through pain but hospitals are better than they used to be anyway; she will be fine.\u201d Umm, have you read the latest stats on maternal and infant mortality? Because childbirth is still quite dangerous. It is completely understandable for her to be nervous, and given how dismissive you are of the risks, I can see why she wouldn\u2019t want you there. This seems to be all about YOU and not about how you can support your wife.\n\nEditing to add: According to his own comments, he hasn\u2019t been to any Lamaze classes, and hasn\u2019t been able to help her when she\u2019s feeling pain/nausea from the pregnancy aside from \u201cbuying her stuff.\u201d My judgement stands, but I think that these reasons are also probably why she doesn\u2019t want you there. Because if you haven\u2019t been a helpful, supportive partner during the pregnancy, so why should she expect you to be a helpful, supportive partner during labor.", "YTA - Every pregnant woman has the dignity of making her own decision on the delivery without having to explain herself.  This is one of those moments in life when you are entitled to feel disappointment but she is entitled to demand you not bring it up for the next 70 years.", "Oh, man. This is tough. I wish you could see your child at the moment it is born, but\u2026\n\nFirst, know that if you aren\u2019t in the delivery room, it won\u2019t matter in so far as your relationship with your child goes. Nobody can replace you. \n\nSecond, delivery is a really messy experience with screaming, cursing, blood, pee, poop and vomit. It\u2019s really pretty gross. Your wife may not want to have you see all of this. She may just be more comfortable with her mom there.  It\u2019s not intended to slight you, but to have the comfort of another woman. \n\nWhen my first child was born, I was alone. The nurse was an older woman who had 6 kids. It was so helpful to let her take over. The experience was so intense and painful and, had I had to consider the father, who I loved deeply, it would have been an unhelpful distraction. \n\nYou will hold this child in the first moments of it\u2019s life. You are it\u2019s father.  Nothing will change that. If your wife wants her mom there, let it happen, but be on the other side of the door, just in case.", "YTA. Tbh I don\u2018t think her not wanting you there is about her relationship with her mom. It\u2018s about her not being comfortable with you seeing her in that situation and you have to accept that.

YTA", "u/IcyEssay1104 Hey OP, I'm a doctor working in the OBG (Labour and Delivery department)and see more than a dozen birth any given day. So, trust me when I say I know what I am talking about. \n\nLet me first say, your MIL is an AH. Or the orifice on the front side. \n\nBut apart from that, I do want to tell you something. Just because the medical field has developed, it does not mean the hardships of labour have decreased, at all. The death due to it, certainly. But not the pain or trauma. The way your last couple of paragraphs have dismissed the horrifying reality of the birthing process with a simple she will be fine is ignorant at best. Please inform yourself on it further. \n\nGiving birth COTINUES to be the most traumatizing experience most women will ever face in their entire life. \n\nThis is not, and will NEVER be a spectator sport. Neither you, (and def not your MIL) have ANY RIGHT to be there in the delivery room. Your child is yours and all your rights over them will continue AFTER the baby is born and safe. \n\nLet me say this again, hospitals did not start to allow fathers/relatives into the hospital because it is their RIGHT. It started because the MOTHERS wanted their loved ones around for support. \n\nYou need to understand your ONLY purpose there is to support the mother. After the mother and child is stable, you can marvel at the miracle that has been created by the two of you. \n\nBoth your comments and some of the things you have written seem to indicate you see the delivery as YOUR RIGHT, and not an extremely painful (did you know most known pain killers don't work on labour pains?) And highly invasive medical procedure your wife will be undergoing. \n\nPlease, please, for the sake of the child you say you love so much, stop dismissing your wife and her choices. You seem to have an equal say in the baby related decisions so far (naming, room decor, etc.). A lot of people may down vote me on this, but the simple fact is, delivery room is not a baby related decision. It is a mother related medical decision. \n\nHave you suggested both your MIL and you be there? (Better 2 people who love her than just one!) What's up with you insisting it ONLY be you? That sounds more like a pissing contest with your MIL than love for your kid or concern for your wife. Why can't she be with TWO people that she loves? You don't seem to be offering that alternative either. \n\nESH. \n\nPlease do better for your wife and child.", "YTA.  Your wife is looking for comfort and support while she accomplishes giving birth.  She will be in a great deal of pain , and will need loving support.  She has chosen the person who she believes will give it to her.  You both should take a long hard look at your relationship to understand why you don't have that bond.\n\nMy ex husband attended the birth of my daughter.  He was a nightmare.  He felt faint, he was not supportive of me.  At one point, he was getting more attention than I was in the delivery room.  I sure wish I had my mom with me then.", "Oh, you had me until the edit. YTA. \n\nI would have said N A H. I totally get why you would be hurt not being in the room, it is a critical moment and memory, and that is your child being born and you and your wife are together and planning to raise this child together. And I get that your wife is the one having a medical procedure and her comfort and preferences matter more. Ideally, she would appreciate that you being there outweighs the reasons she only wants her mother, but if she can't get there, you two figure out how to move forward. \n\nBut then, you became fully the asshole. \n\n1. You married her and decided to have a child with her knowing her mother would always come first (in your opinion). Whether true or not, you think it is and still get mad about something you already knew was part of her core belief system. \n2. You didn't say you wanted to be with your wife, you said you wanted to be the ONLY person with your wife. If she wants her mom there, don't interfere with that. You should have made the case why you should be there TOO, not instead of her mother. \n3. Your beef is with your wife, not her mother. By texting your MIL being rude and making assumptions of why she is in the delivery room, you created more problems and fixed none. Lets say you are right, that her mother bullied her in to being the only person in the room, how do you think texting her what you did would change her mind or the situation? Did you think she would be like \"hee hee, you caught me, sorry about that, I'll butt out now!\" No of course not, she is going to show her daughter that you are rude and paranoid and now you have created even more conflict, where you definitely look like the bad guy. \n4. And then, your edit. \"She will be fine\" demonstrates that you clearly do not appreciate how terrifying having a baby could be, so makes me appreciate why your wife is choosing her other. If your attitude is as your edit says, you have probably dismissed her concerns or fears a number of times, and also shows that you think this is more about YOU having a right to watch your baby born, more so than it is about you wanting to be there for your wife. \n5. Also in your edit- you help her but she says you don't do enough. Is there any clearer indication for someone actually not being helpful than when they write this sentence?\n\nTaking your own post and edit all together, it's pretty clear you have demonstrated a lack of empathy and emotional maturity, which is likely the reason your wife wants her mother, and only her mother, in the room. YTA.", "YTA for this:\n\n>I frankly do look down on her for being a teenage mother. I think she should've gotten an abortion and it's selfish to bring a child into the world without a father and stable income, but I digress\n\nThat child she brought into the world grew up to marry you and is now about to give birth to your child. Literally without your MIL choosing to bring your wife into the world, your wife doesn't exist and your child never exists.", "YTA\n\nAnd that was before your edit. After, just wooooow. You said your wife should have been aborted, dude. What the fuck?", "Like others pointed out you're absolutely not the ah for wanting to be in the delivery room and have a conversation or two about it with your wife. But you'll become the ah if you keep pressuring it. Also I'm real close with my mum and she wasn't a teenage mum. So I'd go with YTA for now.", "YTA. \n\nGiving birth is scary and painful and your wife wants someone by her side who is there to support her. Wanting your mom to be there for you is a totally normal desire. It's not a sign of 'loving her over me', it's a sign of who she feels safe around while she's going to be at her most vulnerable. It's neither stupid nor childish, and you're the selfish one for insisting she give you a 'good enough' reason. \n\nGiven how you've described your jealousy of your wife's close relationship with her mom (her own mom!) and your entitlement, it's clear why your wife feels you wouldn't support her, or is afraid you would turn the event into some kind of pissing contest with your MIL. She might even be afraid that you'd no longer find her sexually attractive after witnessing childbirth - it's not uncommon for men to find themselves disgusted and turned off by the messiness that is childbirth. She might be anxious that'll happen to you.", "Do I think it\u2019s weird that she doesn\u2019t want you in the delivery room and understand why you\u2019re hurt? Yes. \n\nBut is it still her choice? Yes. \n\nDo I see why you might be hurt by that? Yes. \n\nAre you the AH for expecting your wife not to love her mother and for confronting MIL instead and viewing your wife\u2019s love as something that can be granted to both of you and trying to tell your wife it should be you in the delivery room instead of asking if it could be both you and her mother? Well\u2026 also yes.\n\nSo I guess for me it\u2019s ESH at least a little bit (but quite possibly MIL most of all) - this is a tough spot to be in, good luck with it. (I might consider some marriage counseling cause there\u2019s seemingly a fuckload of tension here)", "YTA, birth can be scary and traumatic, she needs the person she feels most supported by. Your \"she'll be fine\" is quite telling. I worked in delivery units for 20 years, I have seen mothers die, I have seen babies die. I have seen many, many women tear all the way from vagina to anus. There is no \"she'll be fine\" automatically, to think so is to show great ignorance and belittles your wife's fears.", "YTA. You need who you need. \n\nYes medicine has changed a lot. Yes she is highly likely to be fine. BUT. This is a medical procedure and she is the patient. \n\nGiving birth is usually long. Scary. Painful. Humiliating. \u2026and you need who you need. My husband is my best friend, yes: my partner, yes. But when I\u2019m sick or hurt the first person I want is still my mommy. \n\nTry to be supportive of your wife. If your request is \u201cplease let me hold baby second (wife is first)\u201d, that may be easier for her than \u201clet me take the place of the person who has seen you at your best and worst your entire life, the person who has given you comfort every time you\u2019ve been sick or hurt\u201d.", "YTA big time, it\u2019s her medical procedure and she has a right to have the people that will make that process easier for her in the room. You have a right when it comes to parenting your son, but not over your wife\u2019s body.", "YTA but I get it to some degree. Obviously it\u2019s rational to want to be there to see your own child come into the world, but you should not have gone after your MIL and overreact the way you did. I would sit down and talk about why specifically she doesn\u2019t want you there and if she doesn\u2019t want to talk then there is nothing you can do. It\u2019s fine if she wants her mother there but there has to be a reason she doesn\u2019t want YOU there. If her favoring her MIL over you becomes a pattern even after the baby is born, you might want to look at divorce, but based on your comments, I don\u2019t see think it will.", "Oh my god OP your last edit, I can\u2018t.

This guy thinks his MIL should have aborted his WIFE?", "YTA. You don\u2019t decide what the wholesome moments are. Your wife does since she is the one who is pregnant. Your wife you would think should have been aborted. Who says that about their own wife.  You would just be a burden on your wife during delivery if you missed the classes. Would you let someone at work give an important presentation if they were just hired yesterday? Your have been awful to your wife. Why don\u2019t you focus on manning up on your own instead of putting an extra time burden on your wife to go to couples counseling. Where is she supposed to find the time for that with a newborn?

Her mother has been incredibly invasive with the pregnancy and my wife lets her do it.\n\nMy wife and MIL have an extremely close relationship.

It's probably because her mom was a teenage mom (got pregnant at 15) so I guess it's easier to treat her own daughter like her BFF.\n\nMy wife wants her mother to be in the delivery room. ONLY her. She doesn't want her father, or siblings, or her own husband. Just her mom and no one else. And it hurts because I have to accept the fact that she will always love her mom over me. I bet if I she had to choose between me and her mom falling off a cliff, she would rush to her mom.\n\nI tried talking to my wife and asking her that I want to be the only one in the room. It's my kid too and it's unfair to not see him be born. My wife told me that she's the one \"shitting from her vagina\" so she can choose whoever she wants. I asked why she wants her mom over so bad; she just said \"I was technically with my mom when she gave birth so I want her to be with me when I give birth.\" Which is the most stupid, childish reason.\n\nI honestly started to believe her mother forced the entire thing on her, just because she wanted to be included in everything. I texted my MIL telling her that her daughter is not her best friend, she is her daughter, and she should allow her daughter to include her husband in her life and the delivery room. She told me it was my wife's choice not hers and having sending laughing emojis going \"Are you jealous???\"\n\nIt pissed me off so I left her on read. My wife found out and told me I'm being a controlling dick about the whole thing and just to deal with it. She has no idea how hurtful this is for me.

It's a magical moment and the father of the baby (in my opinion) should be there if he wants to be. Plus having a helping hand in the room for ice chips, a hand to squeeze, etc would be nice!\n\n>My wife wants her mother to be in the delivery room. ONLY her. She doesn't want her father, or siblings, or her own husband. Just her mom and no one else. And it hurts because I have to accept the fact that she will always love her mom over me. I bet if I she had to choose between me and her mom falling off a cliff, she would rush to her mom.\n\nI honestly don't know if your wife loves her mom more than you, but one thing is certain: my mom will ALWAYS love me and find me beautiful, even if she watches me give birth. There is a level of certainty in a relationship like that, and there's no need to be shy or embarrassed about bodily functions when Mom is there. My mom helped me with my kiddo for the first week of being home and it was so nice to not have to worry about being gross, undressed, etc. I was worried that if my husband could be there, it would gross him out so much he would no longer find me attractive or love me. \n\nI highly recommend therapy. You are NTA for wanting to be in the room and pushing a little, but she is NTA for wanting the comfort of her mom in a difficult moment. However there are clearly some unexplored feelings about her relationship with her mom and how it affects you that need to be discussed asap. The stronger your marriage is, the easier it will be to co-parent. \n\nGood luck, OP!", "It's crazy that people are taking her side\n\nI see it now actually. You're the man, therefore your feelings don't matter. \n\nOn a serious note, she sounds like a childish selfish ah alongside her mother. \n\nMaybe it's because her mom was a teenage *parent* but she was obviously not taught life isn't fair and just because she carried the baby doesn't mean you didn't help and shouldn't be allowed in while the equally your child is born. \n\nI don't think their relationship is necessarily the problem and I won't defend your stance on her, per se. \n\nHowever...\n\nI'm amazed she is still your wife. \n\nI would honestly do some self reflecting and ask yourself if you want to live this life or if you want to get out while you're still young. \n\nI would have a hard time settling down with someone like this and to be clear, it's on both of you to an extent. \n\nBut I imagine bills wouldn't be getting paid if you weren't working. She'll get a hard dose of reality with you out of the picture. \n\nShe doesn't seem to respect that each of you guys have a very important role in this, together. \n\nAgain, surprised she is still your wife and I would consider changing that if I was in your shoes.", "ESH.", "nta.. this is just WRONG. .tine to have a serious sit down with her..w/o her mom present.", "~~This is an experience for the two of you.

It\u2019s totally okay to be disappointed, but at the end of the day, you need to respect her decision and stop pushing the issue. Yes, you contributed to the creation of this baby, but this is your wife\u2019s medical procedure. SHE is the one giving birth, so she gets to decide who she wants to be there when she gives birth.\n\nEdit: spelling", "That\u2019s not an answer. This very clearly proves that you don\u2019t actually know how to support her and you just want to be there for your own selfish reasons. You invalidate her for thinking that someone telling her \u201cyou can do this\u201d is comforting to her. If you were that concerned about being a support to your wife you would have done some kind of research. Never mind being too busy with work. You buy a book and do some reading on your breaks or before bed. If you really cared about comforting her you would have figured out how best to do so. Not go behind her back and try to take her support system away from her so you\u2019re the only option. You say you know your wife best and know what she will need. But she also knows you best and seems to think you\u2019re not going to be much help\u2026 otherwise she would allow both of you.", "Yta because you refuse to recognize you haven\u2019t been the person to comfort her at all during this entire pregnancy. Her mother has. You are already been a shit partner and I anticipate shit dad.", "Are you a father?", "I just think it\u2019s heartless for a woman to deny a willing and active future father the joy of participating in his child\u2019s birth. The law part I mentioned is probably an over reaction, but fathers should have more rights when it comes to children imo. This is an extension of that. The baby is also a patient in this procedure, and the father of that child, assuming he\u2019s going to be an active father, should have rights.", "No but I am married. If my wife wanted me not to be there, fine whatever. She's the one pushing a watermelon out of her vagina too. Plus, I'd be taking care of my child for the rest of my life.\n\nYou just sound misogynistic and you are trying to create ways to criticize me for either being a woman or fatherless.\n\nNot every man is controlling over their wife's pregnancy.", "I am a father and I couldnt disagree with you more. \n\nIf my wife didnt want me to be in the delivery room I would have waited outside. Its the mother and baby that are important, not me.\n\nOf course such a law could never be passed. You cant have thought this through at all. You are talking about legally forcing the expectant mother to have people in the delivery room that she doesnt want there. There is no way this wouldnt increase stress in some cases.\n\nAll medical procedures are a numbers game. Your ridiculous proposal, if passed, could not fail to make the numbers measurably - worse. It would be political suicide.  \n\nWhat would the slogan be: \"Tough on babies, tough on the causes of babies\"? \n\nGive your head a shake."]}
