We both have demanding jobs and split household chores although I act as the manager and planner for all the things.\n\nAnyway, today I asked him to help me get ready for his family coming over. He will not help if I don\u2019t give him tasks. He will go to the attic where his office is or he will play games on his phone. He says he needs the list because he isn\u2019t a mindreader. So I asked him to help our young son clean up his playroom and his room. While he does this, I\u2019m making food that his family likes for the next day. I go upstairs for something and my son wants to show me his room and the books are all just thrown on to the shelf in a pile. And then I see the playroom and it\u2019s a mess with piles of junk all over. I usually clean these room so I tell him that all the toys have a spot to be put away and the rooms aren\u2019t clean. It\u2019s only been like 10 minutes, so he just halfassed it. My husband gets really mad and he says it looks fine. I\u2019m like, can you please just help clean up the house before they come? We had plans today this evening and I had been working nonstop this week so I was super stressed to get this done. \n\nHe says I\u2019m criticizing him, screams at me and says he is done helping with the house. Mind you I have bought and wrapped all the gifts for his family and him and our kids, and bought and prepared all the food. So I\u2019m like no way is he gonna just bounce on cleaning now. \n\nSo I said, and this is where I may be the asshole, I said \u201c if you can\u2019t help get the house ready then your family doesn\u2019t need to come over tomorrow. We won\u2019t have anyone over.\u201d He was livid and stormed outside to call his grandma and cancel even though I said that if he helped then they can come over. He said he wouldn\u2019t live in a house or a marriage where he would be told what to do or who could come over. I just felt completely disrespected that he would bail on me. \n\nAnyway, my husband starts packing all his clothes and personal belonging and putting them by the front door and saying he is moving out he said that his grandma was coming to get him and he was done with me. He kept saying I ruined Christmas. I started sobbing and BEG him not to traumatize our kids by doing this two days before Christmas. And pur young child is hearing all of this chaos.  Plus, I asked are you just not going to see him on Christmas? He finally relents after I have to grovel and cry to him. He cools off and then cleans half the house without any direction. I calmed down and clean the other half without speaking to him..

You are not a queen and be is not a child. You can't tell your spouse they can't have family over unless that family has done something to be banished from the house. Additionally, you two have to be in agreement. As for his behavior cleaning and the childish act of running away from home to Granny's, he needs to grow TF up and do what he's supposed to do - clean like a mad man for 1 hour and sit tf down. If he wants to be a lazy af, let him be and make sure his family knows he wouldn't clean while you were cooking for everyone.", "ESH*\n\nI put the asterisk because I think both of y'all did some iffy things, but I think your husband was more of an asshole than you were. I think you were iffy when you got upset that the playroom wasn't as perfectly neat as you wanted it to be. It is reasonable for a child to play in their playroom and I don't know how much time was scheduled to pass between that moment and when your family arrived. I think at that moment, it was ok to half-ass it, as maybe your son would continue playing there until your husband's family arrived. You or your husband could have finished up the remainder of it later, closer to when they got here. The other iffy thing on your part was crying & groveling when he started to leave. If he wants to leave, that's his decision. And after his behavior, why would you wanna try to make him stay? That won't fix the issue right away & could even lead to some resentment fostering (on both of y'alls parts). On the other hand, your husband was a massive asshole in that he wasn't an active participant in the cleaning, especially when it was his family coming over too. His entire attitude seems very flippant in that he makes you do all the mental work, and he only half-asses his physical help. Furthermore, he acted like a total child when he started to leave to go to his grandma's house, simply because of an argument about cleaning. If it were an argument about something more emotionally heavy, maybe some distance would have helped. But cleaning is a responsibility of everyone in the house, with tasks delegated based on a person's age & ability. He should grow up & take some accountability, both for cleaning and for his behavior.\n\nSide comment: I agree with the prior commenters who suggested a family chore chart, and for your teenagers to help with chores as well. They are definitely old enough to be contributing to the household at this age.", "ESH. Your husband most of all for being a lazy slob. You, for a) weaponizing the holiday and not dealing with this earlier and b) for giving him the drama we wanted. The two of you need therapy.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you sounded like before he \u201cleft\u201d but I know I grew up in a house like this and it takes two to create a fight like the one you describe.\n\nTry therapy, or divorce the guy. Your kids deserve better than this.", "ESH, you literally call yourself the manager. You are not at work and he isn't your employee. The books were on the shelf, why do they have to be perfectly arranged? Why do you feel the need to be that controlling? He's rebelling like a teenager because you are treating your husband like you're his mom and he's your teenager.", "Frankly it sounds like you both are. YOu both have this big toteboard in the sky where you get points for what you do or don't do and then use it to minipulate each other into doing what you want.\n\nYou ask him to clean for his parents visit. He cleaned. It didn't meet your standards. Which means you get more points for doing it better. WHy not just let them come and have a wonderful Christmas with their grandkids and son and you.  Does your mother-in-law do house inspections while she is there? If so, you just say, yeah he and James cleaned his room yesterday, but you know boys.  ANd leave it at that. If she pushes the issue, then she's the AH, not you.\n\nI get it you wanted a clean house before guests come. I cleaned and vacuumed this morning, knowing full well the grand dog was coming and there would be hair everywhere. But you know what, I get to spend time with my kids and I will vacuum again after they leave.    \nYes, I want a clean and tidy home before we have guests, but I also want a loving and healthy marriage.\n\nI made a list. A very specific list. I laid it on the counter where Hubby and I could both see the list and as we did tasks, we checked them off, so that we both got to see the progress as it was made. And once the list was done, we each got to take a bit of a nap before the guests arrived and were ready for company when they get here tomorrow.", "YTA. He clearly doesn't have the same standards as you have, and by this time, you should know it. Also, it's not a good idea to order him around. You can only ask him to help. Your attitude will determine how he will react to your requests. It seems that it's more important for you to impress your in-laws than have a relaxed atmosphere in your home.", "YTA.

You both went nuclear without any consideration for the kids.", "Yta Couldn\u2019t imagine being married to someone like you", "ESH. \n\nHe needs to help, there is no question about that. \n\nYou need to let things go. Who cares if the bookshelf has perfectly lined up books? And the playroom is going to be destroyed again tomorrow. \n\nYou need a family chore chart and a plan. And where were your teenagers during all of this? They can't pick up a mop? Or help their brother so that the adults can handle other things?\n\nBTW, my mom used to stress out and yell every holiday. I adore my mom but she made the pre-holiday things terrible and stressful for everyone. It got to the point that my dad would just pack us up and let her do her thing because nothing was good enough.

We both have demanding jobs and split household chores although I act as the manager and planner for all the things.\n\nAnyway, today I asked him to help me get ready for his family coming over. He will not help if I don\u2019t give him tasks. He will go to the attic where his office is or he will play games on his phone. He says he needs the list because he isn\u2019t a mindreader. So I asked him to help our young son clean up his playroom and his room. While he does this, I\u2019m making food that his family likes for the next day. I go upstairs for something and my son wants to show me his room and the books are all just thrown on to the shelf in a pile. And then I see the playroom and it\u2019s a mess with piles of junk all over. I usually clean these room so I tell him that all the toys have a spot to be put away and the rooms aren\u2019t clean. It\u2019s only been like 10 minutes, so he just halfassed it. My husband gets really mad and he says it looks fine. I\u2019m like, can you please just help clean up the house before they come? We had plans today this evening and I had been working nonstop this week so I was super stressed to get this done. \n\nHe says I\u2019m criticizing him, screams at me and says he is done helping with the house. Mind you I have bought and wrapped all the gifts for his family and him and our kids, and bought and prepared all the food. So I\u2019m like no way is he gonna just bounce on cleaning now. \n\nSo I said, and this is where I may be the asshole, I said \u201c if you can\u2019t help get the house ready then your family doesn\u2019t need to come over tomorrow. We won\u2019t have anyone over.\u201d He was livid and stormed outside to call his grandma and cancel even though I said that if he helped then they can come over. He said he wouldn\u2019t live in a house or a marriage where he would be told what to do or who could come over. I just felt completely disrespected that he would bail on me. \n\nAnyway, my husband starts packing all his clothes and personal belonging and putting them by the front door and saying he is moving out he said that his grandma was coming to get him and he was done with me. He kept saying I ruined Christmas. I started sobbing and BEG him not to traumatize our kids by doing this two days before Christmas. And pur young child is hearing all of this chaos.  Plus, I asked are you just not going to see him on Christmas? He finally relents after I have to grovel and cry to him. He cools off and then cleans half the house without any direction. I calmed down and clean the other half without speaking to him.. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And then instead of cooling off, coming back to discuss the matter like an adult he called his family and canceled the party even though she said they could still have it. \n\nHe had an over reaction to her asking him to clean like an adult even *after* she cooked, cleaned, wrapped gifts, etc. he expected her to still do much more than him.\n\nThen, after the fight, he comes back and cleans the *right* way *without* her input or direction. He knew what he was doing. It's weaponized incompetence. It's playing dumb so he can unwind from a taxing job.", "He screamed at her and threatened to leave her *in front of all the children* two days before Christmas.

You'd done just about everything so they could have a nice visit and instead of appreciating that and doing his part, he wants to check out and play a game on his phone.\n\nI'm not armchair diagnosing, all I'll say is his reaction is ridiculous at best. But, if he does have a personality disorder (which does sometimes result in behaviors like what you've described here -- especially around the holidays) therapy can make the situation worse, so I'd urge you to try individual therapy first if you can. Unfortunately, people with personality disorders, particularly narcissism, often get \"better\" at being awful people by going to therapy. The worst thing my father (borderline personality disorder) ever did was go to therapy where he learned new ways to weaponize his cruelty.\n\nAlso, do check your standards for yourself and your family -- if his family is super critical, I get being stressed about their visit. But by the same token, you get to enjoy the holidays too, and the less stressed you can be about \\*everything\\* needing to be super special for them, the more likely everyone is to enjoy the visit.", "Yeah that\u2019s not \u201ca temper\u201d that\u2019s \u201ca manipulative asshole\u201d", "And embarrass his ass.

I've known people like this, who have an expectation of exactly how perfect they want something. Nobody can measure up and it builds and builds until the person can't take it anymore.

Of course the post is in her perspective but it\u2019s easy to read between the lines. She wants things her way and she\u2019ll first demand it, then blackmail, then resort to emotional manipulation.
