I have smokers on either side. But I just deal with it as they are entitled to use their garden how they want, just as I'm entitled to use mine how I want.\n\nIf they're out smoking I just nip inside for my inhaler and go back out in 5 minutes time. Same if they have a BBQ I just stay in that evening. Sure it can be annoying but you can't just go around asking everyone to manage your asthma for you.\n\nSame if your veggie or vegan", "or they're vegan and *love* the smell", "I\u2019ve also got a mesquite allergy! It took me years to figure that one out.", "I assuming that you only would be affected in you were close proximity to the smoke, but not if someone next door or several houses down was grilling. Or is that not accurate?", "So what are the 2 things cause that\u2019s what I\u2019m most interested in. God really must have been having a bad day when he threw you together wasn\u2019t he?", "I would study his schedule and cook a steak each time he walks by.", "Oh ofc also pls don't moan loud when you have sex cuz I can't make my wife do that also don't be happy in your home cuz my life is miserable also also don't make your house look good cuz I get jealous.  \n\nTYSM!\ud83d\ude4f", "I\u2019m a vegetarian but this would make me grill meat", "I remember this one", "All these issues can be resolved my the main character taking responsibility for themselves and wearing a mask. Bbq smoke also makes me sick so if neighbors do it I pop on my mask. Someone cooking fish that makes me hurl? On goes the N99\n\nThese people are so entitled it's astounding, really", "If they are allergic, it would be to woodsmoke, like bbq chips. I have those allergies myself. Charcoal or propane would be fine I'd imagine since neither of those have allergens in them.", "For good measure, \u201c13th annual Ribfest\u201d\n\nReminder at the bottom: \n\nUpcoming Events: \n\n\u201cBrisketfest will be on July 4th weekend again this year\u201d \n\n\u201cPulled Porkfest in Augustthe weekend before school starts\u201d\n\n\u201cCooks choice for Labor Day weekend\u201d\n\n\u201cChili cook off for Halloween\u201d", "Yep asthma too and BBQ smoke flares me up, but I like eating good food so we just duck dodge and inhaler don't we. I don't think you can be allergic to charcoal smoke any more than every human on earth that would die if they inhaled loads of it.", "Sadly, the problem is that these people DO expect you to manage their asthma for them. Thank you for being a sane human with some common sense.", "The only realistic soluton to get rid of smoking neighbours is to move to move away from everyone. I did that. I don't have asthma, but I hate smoking with a passion. We used to live in an old apartment building where we had smoking neighbours, we couldn't even keep the windows open in the summer.\n\nLiving among other people means we have to deal with stuff like smells, noises and people just doing their thing.", "I am allergic to perfumes and scents. Certain days, depending on how the air carries, I can smell 'your' dryer running a few houses away. It sucks, my face gets puffy and leaky, and my breathing gets tight. But.. I'd never tell you to run your laundry only during my away hours.", "Barbequed pork, chicken, burgers...\n\nRoast weenies in one of those portable driveway fire pits when they're outside...", "I'd toss one onto the sidewalk", "Steak hell.

Thankyou, keep doing you.", "Give him the Ol' Uncle Rico", "The price of steak in Berkley is like a months rent.", "In this case, assuming the neighbor isn\u2019t making this up, the likely allergy is to the woods used in barbecuing. The fact that they are just saying they\u2019re allergic to barbecue smoke suggests to me that they\u2019re lying. If they were to go around saying, \u201chey, I\u2019m super allergic to these woods and the smoke produced when using them to barbecue\u201d I would probably try to avoid using those woods.\n\nThis just reeks of bullshit.", "Excuse me I\u2019m allergic to your comments so could you just stop posting, it would be much appreciated.
