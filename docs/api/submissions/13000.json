There is no need, absolutly 0 need to clean the area where you are having your break at that moment. You even offered to to it yourself after you finished working. If the insists on doing it at that moment, it seems that she is only doing it to bother you.

If there is something wrong she has a mouth with which she can communicate.", "NTA\n\nWhat is her problem? You asked her not to do it and that you will do it yourself later on. I would drop the vacuum that second if I was offered it. Why does he HAVE TO clean at that time only? She is being unreasonable for no good reason.", "NTA but you probably spent more time arguing than it takes to do a quick sweep of an apartment. I get she wants to clean but if there wasn't a pressing reason to do it that exact minute, it could have waited especially since you offered to do it later. I would have also offered to dust too when I got home because the vacuum always kicks up dust.", "NTA.  Your break was more important and time sensitive. She can clean another time.", "NTA-you're right, she could've done it before your break or can do it after, is there some reason she HAS to do it on your break?", "NTA. There's little reason she couldn't do something else for the remainder of the hour that you are on break and then finish the vacuuming after you are done.", "NTA could it perahaps be your girlfriend doesn't like you watching TV on your lunch and is being passive aggressive instead of talking to you about it?", "NTA based on the info you've given us but she's clearly trying to tell you something. Has she talked to you about using your lunch break more productively around the house or anything like that? It kind of sounds like she wants you to do chores and pick up the house instead of watching TV. I'm on the TV side of this because I work from home and watch stuff while I relax at lunch but you need to talk to her to see what she was really thinking.", "INFO: What would you have said if she\u2019d started vacuuming while you were working?", "NTA. I\u2019m in a similar work situation and my partner knows I need that hour to decompress.", "NTA\n\nThis a new twist on how to work harder not smarter. \n\nYou must be the worst at vacuuming for her to insist on doing it herself, at that moment.

Sometimes girls are just mad with themselves and need attention\u2026", "NTA but can I suggest some couples counselling as this honestly cannot be your only issue with communicating with eachother or this molehill wouldn't be being made into the mountain you find yourselves on.

Sure you wouldn't be able to hear it but this seems like a really minor thing that's getting blown out of proportion.\n\nI guess ESH? This is really silly.", "INFO\n\nWas the apartment particularly messy? Or was there some specific thing she was cleaning? Or was this just general cleaning.\n\nIf there was something specific she was trying to clean up (maybe broken glass, or a large amount of dirt) I can understand her not wanting to wait. You don't want dirt like that ground into carpets. Best to clean it as soon as you can.", "ESH\n\n\nYou two need to learn to communicate and value each other's time. This seems bigger than just vacuuming...\n\nAlso how long does it take to vacuum where the TV is?? You're not living in a mansion. Go take a pee break or watch your show in a different room, or get some fresh air. Let her finish. Next time set up a cleaning schedule that works for BOTH of you.", "YTA. Title is misleading. You're not TA for wanting to watch TV during your break in general. But you're TA for saying that gf can't do actual work because you want to watch TV during your break. Get some headphones.", "Get some headphones & link them to your TV.", "ESH. The fact that this is an argument that you feel needs to be discussed by Reddit is weird lol. It\u2019s an incredibly petty argument that should be resolved within minutes with actual communication. Yea it sucks for her to vacuum while you\u2019re taking. A break, but I doubt she\u2019s setting out to ruin your break intentionally.\n\n Yes you work from home, but she lives there too. Perhaps you have a history of saying you\u2019ll do something and then not following through so she wants to do it herself. Perhaps you monopolize the space because you work from home and she\u2019s feels frustrated that for 8 hours a day she can\u2019t exist the way she wants in her own home. There could be a reason she refused to wait, but you wouldn\u2019t know that since you didn\u2019t actually try to talk to her lol. \n\nJust talk to each other for crying out loud.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for interrupting the routine, you suck for not letting her vacuum. It takes what? 10 minutes? Yeah it sucks but life is about compromise.", "So, like other commenters, I do get the feeling there's more to this than you've given us. That said, I disagree with the ESH verdicts and honestly feel it might be a case of AITA's dreaded gender bias.\n\nI find it hard to believe that cleaning was that important that the GF NEEDED to get it done at that moment. To me, it's rude as all hell that she waited until OP was on lunch to clean up the apartment. I mean, on one hand, I understand not wanting to disturb OP while OP is working, but OP offered to clean up after work so that they could enjoy their mid-day break. Gf instigated the fight by insisting she cleaned during OP's break when she almost certainly knew it would disrupt OP's routine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s so obviously inconsiderate. Now, if he\u2019d been an ass about it and decided to start fighting and calling names and stuff then I would probably rule him as the overall asshole, but since he thought about her desire to have a clean house and offered to take it off her hands ( since from what I gathered she was probably stressed out about it) when he could, which was within the same day, might I add ( if he\u2019d offered to do it the next day or the next couple of days I would have said that it was clearly inconsiderate of her desires but that\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s happening here). \n\nI\u2019d say she\u2019s more in the wrong for not considering the compromise and ruining his break. It\u2019s hard to understand people that work long hours on their feet all day if you only work part time, and get plenty of free time and breaks. Believe me, I had to learn the same lesson right out of highschool when a buddy of mine got a job at a chicken plant and was working a little over 40 hours a week with only a 1 hour lunch break. It meant we couldn\u2019t hang out and do stuff all the time like we used to. It\u2019s not the exact same situation but I feel like it still applies. I worked part time at a Cafe, I got half my day free and Sundays completely off. My friend was working all week and hardly got a chance to be off his feet during the day. When he switched to nightshift it was even worse, he\u2019d get in at like, 1am and spend most of his day sleeping, not having much energy to do much. Eventually we found a way to hang out regularly again, but for awhile it was rough and I had to respect his decisions to do what he wanted during his breaks or his off time.", "Not in the near future.

You can't  remember to do something that you forgot. \n\nGiven the time we live in, you surely could have watched stuff on your phone or computer instead of the tv for one day. Your break is an hour. That's a big chunk of time to claim the living room (a shared space) all to yourself when your gf is also home. You did not say where you live, but if you're in the US and you work full time your employer is legally in the wrong if they only give you an hour lunch break. Maybe look up your local laws in that area.\n\nAgain, I only said I suspect YTA. I still can't say I have proof either way. But you don't have to care what I think since I'm not your gf. Set up a nice meal for the two of you and talk about it when your bellies are full and contentment is at maximum. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nit sounds like she cleans on her break and you dont.", "Probably wants OP to spend his lunch break purely with her.\n\nNTA", "Power play!", "It very much does matter, ever reason you gave that op is the asshole could equally apply to his gf. Why can't she do something else it's one day? Why does she have to vacuum right then it's not worth the argument. Op asked gf to wait even offered to do it himself later, why she need to be stubborn? \n\nIf you're arguement is based", "NTA, just probably not in a good mood i think everyone is NTA. Just a squabble", "NTA\n\nSounds like she either doesn't believe you're actually working at home or is jealous she has to go to a physical location", "Yta. She's trying to clean. You can watch TV after work like most people. Just fine something 3lse to do like scroll Reddit......", "Such a weird conflict, such a silly request. Does this happen often? What was she to gain from this?", "NTA. You offered to do the vacuuming yourself.", "Or even next month would probably be fine."]}
