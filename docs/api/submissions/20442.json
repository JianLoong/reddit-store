It doesn't make sense in the context of what they were arguing about.  Unless of course, something else happened that made her feel unwelcome. \n \nGf is either unhinged and there's literally no explanation for her behaviour beyond that, or OP is leaving out details that might make them look like the aggressor.", "OP wrote in a comment that on a previous trip the girlfriend yelled at her and accused her of things and treated her poorly the entire trip and I think that is why OP went aggressive, because it felt like it was happening again.", "Perhaps it's just how OP expresses themself on Reddit, but I have similar qualms about that comment too.  Either gf is unhinged, or OP is leaving something out of this about their own behaviour that would explain this a bit more. \n\nI'm curious about what OP means by gf not liking their personality, for example."]}
