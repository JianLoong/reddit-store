Neither of you is in the right here", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you've surmised the core of the issue. She's not mad at anything **specifically** you've done, but it's likely she's got it in her head that your presence is effectively cockblocking her in some fashion. You're sharing a room with her, and you being back before her is to her some huge impediment, so she's being unpleasant either because she lacks the emotional control that a full grown adult should have, or because she's genuinely being unpleasant to get you to leave.\n\nThe problem here is that it's your room just as much as hers, and if she wants a solo room or a room with just her and her boyfriend than she can fork over the money. Otherwise, it's time for her to cope and learn to cope for all future vacations.", "NTA. I'd get tired of walking on eggshells during vacation too. Your response was perfectly human. It's not fair for her to take her feelings out on you. Especially since she's the older one. I think people on here forget we are human and sometimes we get emotional. Nothing you said while you were expressing her behavior was wrong in my opinion. If you said actually hurtful stuff just to be mean then you'd be an ah.", "NTA.

You definitely need to discuss this situation with your dad. You should tell him how rude she is to you and that you can\u2019t room with her in the future.

Hopefully, your dad will take your needs and feelings into account.", "Tell your brother and her to get their own room. Also, I would discuss the situation with your father.", "No. On the other trip she had a random issue with me, I guess because she had been drinking and she said she was off her medication so it made her really moody. She apparently was mad that I smoked her joint but she found it later on. She also had gotten into a small argument with my brother and she was being really rude to both of us, when she was drunk she basically slammed the hotel room door on me. It was a whole thing but I wrote it off as whatever because she was having a hard time.

The girlfriend is a whole ass adult, getting a free ride on her boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s vacation and is being a petulant child about sharing a room.

She should know better too.", "Inviting the girlfriend was up to the parents and they approved. It\u2019s not up to her. The OP clearly dislikes her brother\u2019s girlfriend.
