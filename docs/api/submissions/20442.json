You're both adults, have a grown up conversation about it.", "NTA\n\nShe seems to have a problem with you existing from your comments. Should you have snapped back at her? Probably not, but people can drive you to breaking points.\n\nShe was probably pissy about them having to share a room with someone. Not your fault, and if she was so upset by it, then she and your brother should have paid for their own room. \n\nDon't apologize to her, though. If she feels like being an adult anytime soon, then it is up to you whether or not you want to attempt friendliness again. I wouldn't go shit talk her to your parents but I will say that you need to talk to your brother. Explain that you've put up with her being rude for no reason for a while, but if she keeps this up, you are going to explain to your parents that you don't want to be around her.", "NTA. You gave her a chance to have space and it sounds like she still got an attitude with you.

Shes a guest and should be mindful not to create drama", "Info: have you ever done something to her before?", "ESH Please grow up. You both sound like drama queens, actively aiming for a fight.", "ESH. This is your loss man. You let her drag you down into the mud.", "ESH. Grow up both of you . Neither of you is in the right here", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you've surmised the core of the issue. She's not mad at anything **specifically** you've done, but it's likely she's got it in her head that your presence is effectively cockblocking her in some fashion. You're sharing a room with her, and you being back before her is to her some huge impediment, so she's being unpleasant either because she lacks the emotional control that a full grown adult should have, or because she's genuinely being unpleasant to get you to leave.\n\nThe problem here is that it's your room just as much as hers, and if she wants a solo room or a room with just her and her boyfriend than she can fork over the money. Otherwise, it's time for her to cope and learn to cope for all future vacations.", "NTA. I'd get tired of walking on eggshells during vacation too. Your response was perfectly human. It's not fair for her to take her feelings out on you. Especially since she's the older one. I think people on here forget we are human and sometimes we get emotional. Nothing you said while you were expressing her behavior was wrong in my opinion. If you said actually hurtful stuff just to be mean then you'd be an ah.", "NTA. You should go and tell your dad about how she treats you.", "Tell your parents about all the drama so she does not get invited next time!", "NTA. You definitely need to discuss this situation with your dad. You should tell him how rude she is to you and that you can\u2019t room with her in the future. Let him know that you feel that she is ungrateful and would prefer that she is not invited to future trips because of her attempts to bully you as well as her overall negativity. Hopefully, your dad will take your needs and feelings into account.", "Tell your brother and her to get their own room. Also, I would discuss the situation with your father.", "No. On the other trip she had a random issue with me, I guess because she had been drinking and she said she was off her medication so it made her really moody. She apparently was mad that I smoked her joint but she found it later on. She also had gotten into a small argument with my brother and she was being really rude to both of us, when she was drunk she basically slammed the hotel room door on me. It was a whole thing but I wrote it off as whatever because she was having a hard time. What I will say is that I think she finds me annoying because I\u2019m younger and maybe she doesn\u2019t like my personality", "OP (who is *six years younger* and barely an adult) has been putting up with this woman\u2019s antics to the point that she was willing to leave her own hotel room to give girlfriend and the brother some space. She\u2019s acted way more grown up than the girlfriend.", "Oh come on. The girlfriend is a whole ass adult, getting a free ride on her boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s vacation and is being a petulant child about sharing a room. OP is just as entitled to be in the room as the girlfriend and the gf was way more out of line.", "She is older then you but she\u2019s acting likes a petty teenager. You are a petty teenager. Y\u2019all both are just being super petty. Try to avoid her and on future trips if she comes try to room with someone else.keep it short and sweet with her when interacting.", "It\u2019s obvious that her SIL is in the wrong too but I\u2019d expect an 18 year old to behave much better too. She did offer to leave the room, but OP than got \u201creally fucking mad\u201d because she was told it\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s not like OP is a little kid. She should know better too.", "Inviting the girlfriend was up to the parents and they approved. It\u2019s not up to her. The OP clearly dislikes her brother\u2019s girlfriend. Both of them are acting like children in a tantrum. \n\nThe brother is an AH too. He\u2019s taking a back seat and letting his sis and girlfriend hurt each other unnecessarily", "OP is an adult too. They\u2019re both adults acting like they\u2019re in kinder garden. OP very clearly doesn\u2019t like her SIL and is acting just as unkind.", "What exactly has the OP done to be petty? The GF has accused her of smoking a joint (which wasn\u2019t true), made faces and snapped at her repeatedly for no reason, and slammed a hotel door on her. OP finally lost her temper and pointed out that the GF\u2019s behavior was out of line and GF was lucky to be getting a free vacation, which is true.", ">\tI told them shortly after that I could hang out in the lobby to give them some space for awhile.\n\nOP was out all night and presumably wanted to go to sleep, but was still willing to leave the hotel room to give GF some space. It was only after the GF made a dig at her that she snapped.

Like you said, OP is barely an adult. There's a lot of subtext we're not getting here. ESH is the most accurate assumption."]}
