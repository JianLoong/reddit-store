Now nobody talks to her or my brother anymore because we are all so sick and tired of her behavior. Good luck, OP", "NAH - your parents are the A holes for making you act as chaperone for your adult brother and his girlfriend", "ESH.\n\nIf your parents invite her to the vacation, they should be mindful enough to get them a separate room. This is something I would speak with them after you're back.\n\nHere is what I think happened: she, and probably your brother, weren't told that they had to share a room with you. She accepted the trip but didn't realize she won't have privacy with your brother. So now she's feels trapped with a half stranger (you) and is upset, but expressing that to your parents would seem ungrateful so she takes it out on you. I definetely think it's wrong and I can totally see this as a pattern. Let me explain.\n\nYour brother seems extremely passive. In my opinion, it's ideal that someone (in this case, your brother) communicates issues between their partner and family members, so they don't have to confront each other directly and the peace is kept between those parties. A very, very wild guess of mine is that your brother fails to do this on a regular basis, and maybe it's him who didn't tell her about the room arrangement. If this is the case, he really is more than an AH as he shouldn't treat his GF as an accessory who will just follow him on family trips and accomodate to whatever situation he's in.\n\nWith that said, and with acknowledging both their immaturity, I also think you acted somewhat rude to her by accident. You're 18, so you probably don't know this, but when someone seems upset, either bring it up nicely or ignore it completely. In your case, the appropriate response to her frozen smile would've been either offering to leave right away, OR asking if she was alright (then she could choose to lie as a way to ask you to ignore her upset, or be upfront about her problem).\n\nShe might be a total asshole, but I think it's totally possible that there is a constant miscommunication between the two of you and you misjudge each other's character. It's your brother that knows the both of you and it's his role to help you about how to conduct yourselves around each other. If the three of you share a room, it's on him to arrange a time with you that they can be alone. But since he didn't, she might have got it in her head that you're trying to sabotage their alone time (and their relationship in the long term). You then sense this but don't know her side, so you think she hates you for no reason. I wouldn't be surprised if you both believed the other was jealous of your brother, hence the constant rubbing shoulders.\n\nIf I was in your situation, I would definetely sit down and talk to her, making an effort to be kind and genuinely try to understand her. I would also MAKE SURE to be clear about when you come and go in your hotel room and keep to it. I'm sure you understand why that is necessary for them to feel that their space is respected (as opposed to leaving the room to let her calm down when she already feels ripped of privacy). I understand that this is a nuisance but there is a good chance that it's your brother's/parents' fault and not hers.\n\nIF you've done all this and she keeps giving you attitude, you should talk to your brother. Tell him how hurt you are that he's not helping you.  IF and only if all of this is done and your brother isn't being helpful, THEN you should talk to your parents. I don't even think they should necessarily punish or talk to the GF, but your brother. I suspect his behaviour is the bigger issue here, not the GF's.", "I'm so confused about all the N T As.\n\nShe said it was fine, then YOU kept it going, she told you to mind your business which is universal for \"don't try to accommodate me by assuming what I need\" and then you yelled at her?

He needs to know this", "In this instance, definitely not the AH. Could it have been handled better? Yes, but I look at your age and understand. Everyone has situations not handled perfectly. She has no right to direct her snottiness towards you. Even if she had reason, she could discuss it with you instead of acting like a hateful brat. She doesn't owe you because your Dad is paying for her to be on vacation, she owes you decent treatment simply because you are a person.", "NTA - Is your brother sharing a room or does he have his own?\n\nBeing neutral in situations like this is BS. His gf needs to get a grip.", "Tell you dad", "NtA bit you're brother is the biggest A here for choosing a lay over his own sister.

It wasn't the best thing to do but I understand it. You also, after she looked at you and threw her bag down, offered to leave and give them space which you absolutely didn't need to do since you're sharing the room. You were kind enough to offer up a solution and even hangout in the lobby just so she could have space. That's a mature thing to do. She refused and then snapped at you! She may be older than you but she's certainly acting childish.", "NTA she is behaving like you are the guest, not her. She sounds spoiled, entitled and insufferable.", "Wait, who's in what room?  How many people are there?  There's you, your dad, your brother and his gf?  And 3 of you are in one room?  Or what's going on?", "NTA I would talk to your parents ,she felt very entitled to this vacation and if she wanted her own room she could pay for it herself. She was taking out her frustration on you who is not the one who planned this vacation or pay for it it was your parents. Talk to them if your brother isn\u2019t willing to set her straight and have her be a gracious guest then your parent should do it.", "You need to make your boundaries and relay them to her. This is how it\u2019s going to be. She seems to use her moods to manipulate. She can\u2019t with you.", "NTA I feel like she's pissed cus they might have been planning to do some sexy time whoch...is a really really stupid choice if that was the case since you two share a room. If you showed up later it would still be a disaster cus then you'd have to sleep else where, most likely with your folks, and they'd wonder why you're even there. Olus, she SHOULD be grateful to even be invited to an all expense paid trip by her bf's dad. Also, your brother's a wuss", "100% SHE IS TA. Taking your anger out on others is wack.

Even as a kid when I got invited on friends trips or to hotel stays (I love hotels... don't ask) I was always super grateful because I knew they were footing the bill and they didn't have to bring me along at all. 24 yo has less maturity than 18 yo.\n\nFrankly OP ignore both your \"neutral\" brother and his gf, go have fun with everyone else. Don't let this ruin the trip.

Then uh oh, that wasn't the case and now she's mad that you're back. \n\nIt kinda sounds like your brother has some cuk energy if after all this he just feels \"neutral\" about the situation. You gotta talk to him about how she's treating you, since he's actually dating her. Obviously you defending yourself isn't helping the situation.", "ESH.\n\nIt sounds like she had a bad attitude about you the whole time.  Was definitely passive-aggressive towards you.\n\nBut you definitely escalated it majorly.", "Your not the arsehole- she is. Should of had different rooms tho.

Have the fake-it-till-you-make-it kind of mentality and assume that she doesn\u2019t have problems with you unless she tells you too. Any number of things could be upsetting her, but unless she tells you that you\u2019re the problem, be the bigger person and assume that you aren\u2019t. Cuz quite frankly, you acted like a major ass to her. She might have not liked you there, but she didn\u2019t say anything. Be the bigger person, even though she could be. Don\u2019t lower yourself to her toddler behavior. Just because she behaves like one, doesn\u2019t mean you have to go down with her.\n\nStanding up for yourself however is always good, but keep it to just that; standing up for yourself but not yelling at her or being unkind. Just tell her you don\u2019t appreciate her behavior towards you but let it go", "Nta talk to your dad about since he made the accommodations", "NTA\n\nEven though you yelled( I don't blame you, I would have too! , you spoke the truth. She's being a negative Nancy. \n\nYour brother- well I feel sorry for him. Sounds like she's not a happy person. I wonder what he sees in her?", "NTA but I\u2019d probably be talking to my dad about not sharing a room in the future or her not being invited", "Wear headphones so her attempts to cause you to behave angrily will be nullified.

It's hard for it to not be your business after she walks into a room with you, looks at you, and then acts like that.", "NTA  she sounds like she some underlying mental health issues which is no excuse to be honest. It\u2019s not your problem if she goes off her medication, runs out of weed, or has too much to drink. Regardless of if she doesn\u2019t care for you, she\u2019s on your family vacation, she\u2019s with her significant others family, what ever happened to basic politeness? Basic human decency, there are family gatherings I go to where I maybe don\u2019t care for everyone but I\u2019m always polite and nice because why not? It sounds like you did everything right, you may not care for her to much because of her attitude but you made an effort to stay polite give her space until she antagonized you to the point where you had to stand up for yourself.

I would never make someone feel that way about being stuck in the same room because I am sure you don't like having to share a room either. \n\nThe girlfriend needs to grow up and mature a lot more because she was way out of line.

If i was the sister and my brothers girlfriend spoke to me like that for no reason I'd be expecting him to put her in her place and telling her not to talk to his sister like that.

At 24 on a free vacation, if I was feeling a bit bummed about not having privacy for Couple Time, I\u2019d ask the hotel if there was an open room for a night of the trip.

She apparently was mad that I smoked her joint but she found it later on. She also had gotten into a small argument with my brother and she was being really rude to both of us, when she was drunk she basically slammed the hotel room door on me. It was a whole thing but I wrote it off as whatever because she was having a hard time.
