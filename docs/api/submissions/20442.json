Now nobody talks to her or my brother anymore because we are all so sick and tired of her behavior. Good luck, OP", "NAH - your parents are the A holes for making you act as chaperone for your adult brother and his girlfriend", "ESH.\n\nIf your parents invite her to the vacation, they should be mindful enough to get them a separate room. This is something I would speak with them after you're back.\n\nHere is what I think happened: she, and probably your brother, weren't told that they had to share a room with you. She accepted the trip but didn't realize she won't have privacy with your brother. So now she's feels trapped with a half stranger (you) and is upset, but expressing that to your parents would seem ungrateful so she takes it out on you. I definetely think it's wrong and I can totally see this as a pattern. Let me explain.\n\nYour brother seems extremely passive. In my opinion, it's ideal that someone (in this case, your brother) communicates issues between their partner and family members, so they don't have to confront each other directly and the peace is kept between those parties. A very, very wild guess of mine is that your brother fails to do this on a regular basis, and maybe it's him who didn't tell her about the room arrangement. If this is the case, he really is more than an AH as he shouldn't treat his GF as an accessory who will just follow him on family trips and accomodate to whatever situation he's in.\n\nWith that said, and with acknowledging both their immaturity, I also think you acted somewhat rude to her by accident. You're 18, so you probably don't know this, but when someone seems upset, either bring it up nicely or ignore it completely. In your case, the appropriate response to her frozen smile would've been either offering to leave right away, OR asking if she was alright (then she could choose to lie as a way to ask you to ignore her upset, or be upfront about her problem).\n\nShe might be a total asshole, but I think it's totally possible that there is a constant miscommunication between the two of you and you misjudge each other's character. It's your brother that knows the both of you and it's his role to help you about how to conduct yourselves around each other. If the three of you share a room, it's on him to arrange a time with you that they can be alone. But since he didn't, she might have got it in her head that you're trying to sabotage their alone time (and their relationship in the long term). You then sense this but don't know her side, so you think she hates you for no reason. I wouldn't be surprised if you both believed the other was jealous of your brother, hence the constant rubbing shoulders.\n\nIf I was in your situation, I would definetely sit down and talk to her, making an effort to be kind and genuinely try to understand her. I would also MAKE SURE to be clear about when you come and go in your hotel room and keep to it. I'm sure you understand why that is necessary for them to feel that their space is respected (as opposed to leaving the room to let her calm down when she already feels ripped of privacy). I understand that this is a nuisance but there is a good chance that it's your brother's/parents' fault and not hers.\n\nIF you've done all this and she keeps giving you attitude, you should talk to your brother. Tell him how hurt you are that he's not helping you.  IF and only if all of this is done and your brother isn't being helpful, THEN you should talk to your parents. I don't even think they should necessarily punish or talk to the GF, but your brother. I suspect his behaviour is the bigger issue here, not the GF's.", "I'm so confused about all the N T As.\n\nShe said it was fine, then YOU kept it going, she told you to mind your business which is universal for \"don't try to accommodate me by assuming what I need\" and then you yelled at her?
