Who gets so bent at not being allowed to try on someone else's clothes that they don't speak to them?  Is this a thing between the two of you, trying on each other's clothes?", "NTA. She's behaving like a spoiled child. Just ignore her and if the subject comes up, remind her how you don't mess with her things and you expect the same courtesy.", "NTA. You're entitled to have things that belong to only you and it's odd that your mother evaluates your clothing from the perspective of if she can wear the items or not.

Your mom is probably struggling with accepting her middle-aged body.

Your mom should have respected that.", "It\u2019s okay to say no, even to your mom :) NTA", "NTA she had you at 16, so my guess is she\u2019s having a hard time realizing she\u2019s not a kid anymore.

She\u2019s not going to ruin your jeans by trying them on and if she did, she probably would buy you new ones. Don\u2019t be a brat.", "Nobody is an AH here. She tried on your jeans, get over it.", "No one is the AH but just move on. It\u2019s not like she stole money from you. Take it as an odd compliment that she likes your fashion sense.", "NAH You know, it\u2019s pretty impossible to rip jeans. You can put on a pair that\u2019s a couple of sizes too small, and the jeans are just fine.\n\nYour mom is a person. Nothing bad would\u2019ve happened if you let her see how she looks in high-waisted jeans. \n\nI get, though, that you\u2019re 15 & you\u2019re worried about your mom looking good in your clothes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No explanation for her behavior then, 21 is adult enough to mature a little imo. Also, once you\u2019re pregnant once, you don\u2019t always \u201cshape\u201d the same way afterwards, so it\u2019s pretty rude to try someone\u2019s clothes on who\u2019s smaller than you.", "Nah.
