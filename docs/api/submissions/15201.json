Sounds to me like you grew up in an abusive environment with your parents, then being conditioned to that treatment went and married your ex. You stuck to your boundary regarding Kari. I am so proud of you for that. Kari has every right to know her siblings and vise versa. \"Out of wedlock\" sounds like psycho excuses to me.

Which is why he's now your ex. He ruined your marriage and nobody else.\n\nHonestly, if he felt so strongly about you having a child already in the way that he does, he should not have stayed in a relationship with you past the point of learning about Kari.

They were the ones that forced you to give up Kari in the first place. So of course they side with your ex.\n\nIgnore all three of them as much as you can.\n\nOh, and as for the idea of adopting Kari... If she wants it, go for it. You never wanted to let her go in the first place.", "NTA. \n\n>thinks Kari will be a bad example on our children because she was born out of wedlock.\n\nYour ex is. .

Kari didn't have an out of wedlock baby.", "NTA\n\nYou divorced your ex, therefore what you do on your parenting time and what he does on his parenting time is pretty much each of your own business unless it's illegal or neglectful.  Even if you put a clause in your divorce documents stating something like neither of you can introduce the kids to a new romantic interest for x number of months, those clauses are pretty much unenforceable. \n\nAnd this isn't a new romantic interest--this is another teenager, and a relative of theirs. Their own half-sibling. Your child.  \n\nThe reason both your parents and your ex \"agree\" is that they all have lived their lives controlling you to an abusive degree.  None of them appear to have ever treated you as an independent individual with an independent life, just as first a dependent of your parents followed by becoming a dependent of your husband.\n\nBy chance, was your ex say a member of the same church or religious group as your parents, and was your relationship with your ex suggested by or explicitly encouraged by your parents?", "NTA. \n\nKari is your daughter. And your parents and ex are saying she'd be a bad influence because she was 'born out of wedlock' fuck that.\n\nYour ex had absolutely NO right to contact her.

Your children are old enough to understand and make the decision if they want to meet their older sister.\n\nJack and your parents need to be careful because the kids will grow up understanding that if your parents were willing to disown you for having a baby and that their dad tried to come between a mother and her daughter, they might choose to go NC because if they can do that to you they will do it to the kids too... They're on the right path to losing their grandkids/kids.", "NTA-Is Jack\u2019s last name \u201cAss?\u201d", "First, I am so sorry your parents and ex have planted these doubts and put you through this.\n\nYou are allowed to build the relationship with your older daughter that works for both of you. And I believe that you are making decisions for your younger children that are in their best interest. If you and your ex both have custody, you are entitled to introduce them to Kari if you want. You wouldn't ask permission before introducing them to other new people in life.\n\nIf the family's line in the sand is the kids not meeting humans born out of wedlock, they're going to exhaust themselves as they go through life. What if the kids' teacher was born out of wedlock? Can they stay in the class? What about friends? Policing that is going to be pretty tough. \n\nThe bottom line is that they're trying to control you and the relationships in your life, and you are allowed to make your own choices now. You sound like one in the family with the example of love to show the kids. Go for it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

These sound like some backward ass people. Blaming a baby for anything is ridiculous.  You don't get a better moral compass because your parents were legal.  She doesn't have better or worse morals based on who birthed her, it's about who raised her and who she is today, and who she is right now is innocent in all of this.  Your ex is a HUGE AH for messaging her about ruining your marriage, and your parents are also huge AHs for saying you'd be better off without her around.  \n\nI mean, 17 is pretty damn young to have a kid, and I probably would have encouraged you to adopt at the time, as well.  But to not welcome that same child back when you had your shert together and a family to give her, when she is in foster care and could really use one?  That's downright cold.", "I\u2019m divorced with children involved and one thing the judge told us the day our divorce got finalized was that we don\u2019t have any say in who the other parent brings around the kids unless that person is dangerous. Your husband has no say in who YOU bring around YOUR kids and you do not have to tell him anything. He\u2019s being petty and ugly and bitter because he sees Kari as the reason for your divorce, when in reality it was his lack of support that caused you to leave him. \n\nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing and forget about him.

As for your parents no contact for life your mom can go where the sun don\u2019t shine.", "NTA - f your EX and f your parents (it's clear none of them have ever had an iota of concern for you or your feelings)\n\nAlso, good for you introducing all the kids. It seems you're a good mother now and will be a good mother to all 4 of them very soon.", "No, you did not mess up and you are NTA.  But your parents and your ex?  Cut them off, they will ruin your children's lives with their archaic views.  Just make sure Kari understands that she had nothing to do with your marriage disintegrating - that was a direct result of you finally growing that shiny backbone and standing up for what YOU need.", "NTA did your children want to meet her? That\u2019s all that matters. Be guided by their wants. \n\nFu@k all those stupid adults in your life. I\u2019m glad you divorced his stupid ass. Go you!", "Totally NTA. \n\nYour ex is an ex for a good reason. Your parents will agree with him regarding Kari because they didn\u2019t want her in the first place. It was not your daughters choice to be born out of wedlock. It doesn\u2019t seem like it was your choice to give her up.", "NTA - your parents were shit then and are still shit now. Your ex is just like them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's only 3 years between the daughter they forced you to give up and your oldest child from the marriage? Ex called *your oldest child* \"a devil\"? Jack and your parents treat you like you're their property. I'm getting Bible Belt/\"we married our daughter off because she brought shame on the family\" bullshit vibes here.\n\nYour heart and morals are in the RIGHT place here and the other \"adults\" here are, quite honestly, cruel and nasty people. Enjoy your new life with *all* of your children, and let the trash take itself out.", "NTA.  I hope you are able to adopt her.", "NTA\n\nOther three alleged adults however...", "NTA.  Your ex doesn\u2019t get a say.  There is a hidden child in our family and when it comes out, I\u2019ll be grabbing some popcorn and watching the sh/t show.", "No you are not. Not even close. You have done this right. The heck with the rest of them. Tell your eldest daughter she did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Follow your heart on this one and forget all outside Interference. You are a mother 1st and wife and daughter 2nd.", "Oh I'm definitely gonna be adopting Kari, I'm contacting a lawyer tomorrow about how to go about it", "Thank you for saying this. I was like the grandparents literally only care because the truth will come out how they forced their daughter to give her baby away.", "That makes me so so happy to hear. I'm sorry for how your ex and family have been treating you, but you are absolutely not the asshole.\n\nI wish you all the best :)", "Yay, congrats. I hope the best for all your kids!"]}
