He\u2019s married her the next month after his and my mom\u2019s divorce and it\u2019s been a lot for me to process. As i don\u2019t live in my hometown anymore, her and her daughter (5f) moved in quick after the marriage. Ever since then, my dad made it very clear that i can only visit \u201ctheir house\u201d by invitation (as if it wasn\u2019t my childhood home) and my step sister is dying to meet me so i should come visit. When i entered the house, my dad told me briefly that him and my step mom told my step sister that i was her real sister by blood, and told me not to tell her the truth. At first it didn\u2019t seem like such a bother but then she started asking me why i had no interest to meet her in the last 5 years, and if i can finally live with her now that we are reunited. That\u2019s when I realised that they painted me as this absent big sister that did\u2019t want to see her. I went off on my dad for lying to her about me and he justified that it\u2019s easier than explaining to her how being step sisters work. It breaks my heart to watch her cry that her big sister doesn\u2019t wanna be her sister. He told me that I am the one that is selfish as i didn\u2019t wanna admit that she was part of the family now and that i wasn\u2019t an only child anymore.

Your dad and step-mom were going to keep this lie going forever? They are clearly the assholes here lying to her kid, sheltering her from the truth instead of explaining the situation.", "NTA  \nThey do realize that plan falls appart the moment your (step? half?) sister learns math right? Or are they going to pretend that his wife got pregnant at 10 by a 30 year old?", "Could the kid actually be your dad's I mean it is possible if they were having a affair?", "NTA, but your dad sure is.", "Absolutely not the A. Gaslighting you over his failure(s)", "Wow! Well lying is something that your dad is good at . Right? You\u2019re not obligated to carry on his ruses in the least. She\u2019ll know the truth eventually and I would suggest that you remain distant. NTA", "Yeah, I'm just gonna say it. How sure are you that she's *not* your blood sister?\n\nStill NTA though.", "NTA..\n\nAnd - have you considered that she IS his daughter and that hes been cheating on your mom for a lot longer than you thought??\n\nHow is your mom doing??  Does she know youre playing family with her ex and the girl he cheated on her with???", " NTA- is he expecting you to not see your mom for Christmas or Mother\u2019s Day? There are plenty of children book\u2019s explaining what a step-sibling is. If I was you I would email your dad and let him know you will not be part of his charade, keep the email so in case you get a angry tween hunting you down you have proof of why you were a mean big sister. If you want a relationship with her it will be as a stepsister and you will not be lying to her about it.", "Your dad is clearly the AH here. He's the one lying to his stepdaughter and causing her pain. Not you. Your dad is a bully and is being really, really unfair to both you and her.\n\nI suggest you tell your stepsister the truth. That your dad married into her family, that you came with that as new family and that you're really excited to have a chance get to know her too.\n\nThere's a ton of good books for kids out there about blended families. I'm sure you can find one that will help reinforce what you're telling her.\n\nThis will thoroughly piss off your dad but that's his fault for lying in the first place. She would eventually figure things out as she grew older so you're simply addressing the problem early.", "Are you sure the daughter isn\u2019t his bio kid?", "So, your father and stepmother think the 5 year old won't grow up and do the maths herself as they only got married when she was five, and you are a good 15 years older?\n\nHow F\\* up are these people?\n\nThey should just be honest and explain they've been married to other people before.\n\nNTA for not wanting to cooperate with such a huge and really silly lie.\n\nBe the honest one.\n\nShe can only respect you for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is not right to lie to the child. I am assuming that the child is not your dad's? Or maybe she is and the affair was going on for a long time. It really doesn't matter, as they are asking you to lie. They have created a troubling and potentially damaging situation for the child. She may grow up believing that she is unlovable. It's unfair to the both of you. If it were me, I'd tell dad that I am not playing this game, and hurting the child. I would also state that she is going to learn the truth of their relationship starting as an affair, and is going to be angry that they lied to her about being a full sister and her sister supposedly not wanting to see her for her first 5 years. It seems like dad and stepmom are trying to pretend that your mom and dad's marriage didn't exist. And the fact that you've been told you must get an invitation to come to the house surely doesn't seem like they are treating you like a full sibling!", "NTA. It\u2019s not hard to explain step siblings. It\u2019s very straightforward in fact. The issue here is that they already told her a lie. & it\u2019s not like they can\u2019t keep it up forever, she will eventually find out & I can\u2019t imagine that she will be happy about it when she does. They\u2019re massive idiots & massive AHs for not taking 5 minutes to explain it to her. Total parental failure. I would not go along with it. I would tell him to explain it to her, or if he\u2019s too crappy of a parent to actually parent, then I was happy to do it for him.\n& I would be curious to know if this little girl isn\u2019t actually your half sister & not a step, like where is her actual dad?", "NTA, so how's the conversation going to go in the future, when he has to explain how step mom had you when she was 10?", "Yeah, this didn't happened. No kid whose dad kicked them and mom out of the house and moved in his mistress a month after the divorce ended is gonna care about the mistress's kid.", "NTA- don\u2019t lie to her. Let the chips fall where they may. They\u2019re just trying to save face and look like saints.", "NTA. This is unbelievably cruel to a kid. Instead of manning up and explaining how step-siblings work, he decided to tell her that she has a long-lost sister that doesn't want to see her. She's only five, so it's likely she'd be wondering what she did wrong. \n\nUnfortunately, unless you just tell her the truth and explain the situation yourself, there might not be much you can do about this other than keeping your distance. I would be wondering what else he is lying about if he was able to lie about something so simple so easily.", "INFO:  What did she say when you cleared everything up?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust go no contact with your AH dad and his family. And if your stepsister asks, tell her the truth. refuse to lie.", "NTA, your dad\u2019s a demon lol. All you need to do is wait till she can do basic maths and can understand that her parents are not good people then they\u2019ll have to face the consequences of their actions.", "That's what I'm thinking.  Dad is trying to get out the idea that they are bio sisters by pretending that he is simply trying to accommodate a child's understanding of relationships.  Which is ridiculous, most five year olds can grasp the idea of step-families.\n\nNTA", "Dad is clearly lying to avoid awkward questions and possible drama. But only for now ..."]}
