We recently got two a new employee in my department C(20F).  I don't know her very well, because I mostly work only from home.  The first day I saw them was actually on the day we celebrated my birthday at work.  I cut the cake in multiple smalls servings so everybody can enjoy and C said \"I shouldn't, I'm watching my weight\".\n\nThe thing is, I am obese 300lbs for 5'8.  I don't have a complex regarding my weight and I am healthy, but I try my best everyday to lose weight since I want to start a family.  I do have multiples medical difficulties regarding losing weight, PCOS being the main one.  And C, she is probably three times thinner than me.  I brushed it off, thinking she just was just making an excuse for not wanting cake.\n\nThe week after, as I came in the office, I heard her saying \"but guys, I am morbidly obese\".  Thinking it was a coincidence, I laughed and said \"If you are, what am I ?\" before getting to my desk.  She continued talking about being \"fat\", despite everybody telling her to change the subject, even told her to calculate her BMI and stop if it doesn't say \"morbidly obese\". Which she did, but denied having a heathy weight despite the calculator saying so.\n\nThe day after, I came in early with a coworker R(28M).  She sat next to him after greeting us.  Before anybody asked or said anything, she quickly told him 'By the way, I'm starting intermittent fasting\".  He asked why and then C explained that her doctor told her yesterday (even though she worked all day?) that \"she has PCOS and if she doesn't lose weight, she will become diabetic\".\n\nI couldn't help but laughed. I know this is bullshit.  She might have PCOS, but there is multiple steps before getting to this point.  R tried to make her stop, but she continued, so I lost it and just told her to \"shut up about her weight\", since I was getting really annoyed.  She didn't said a word to me all day after that.\n\nIt has been two days and I don't feel too good about it.  R told me I am not the blame per se, but I could have been nicer.  My coworkers say that she deserved it since she was told multiple times to change the subject.

There are two possibilities. 1) The doctor really did tell her she needs to lose weight or is at risk for diabetes, in which case the doctor is likely correct. Just because someone is thinner than you doesn't mean they're necessarily healthy. I'm obese. I used to work with a man at least twice my size, so does that mean I can just ignore the scale an doctor's recommendations? And my blood tests saying I'm prediabetic? 2) She's lying about the doctor's orders, in which case she likely has an eating disorder.", "Slight ESH because snapping at her and telling her shut up is not professional office behavior, but she was being obnoxious and had already been told nicely to knock it off with the weight talk. \n\nSo I don\u00b4t blame you for snapping, but it wasn\u00b4t the right thing to do.", "YTA. You don\u2019t know shit about her medical issues but you decided she wasn\u2019t telling the truth anyway because they\u2019re not exactly the same as yours and she\u2019s not as big as you. You owe her an apology.", "YTA, they weren\u2019t talking to you nor about you. And you have no idea if she went to the doctor. Telehealth is a thing and it\u2019s not your business. \n\nI admit they are cringey sounding, but nothing sounded malicious.", "NTA. no matter what she\u2019s struggling with, that\u2019s just not cool, and she should have more self awareness than to repeatedly bring up a topic people have asked her to stop mentioning, especially in the workplace.", "Yta op, she has a health issue and you may get annoyed, but maybe this is new to her and she needs to adjust to her new diet, lifestyle, or maybe rationalize that she is pre diabetic. This is not about you, so don\u2019t make it about you.\n\nI have pcos and SHOCKINGLY both my doctor and dietitian make tele consultation, specially to follow up on my blood exams. \n\nPcos makes me watch what I eat, what I do, everyday. I am thin, and I still have to \u201cdiet\u201d because of this, a couple of years ago I was pre diabetic, and it was really scary to me, and I had to drastically change my diet and lifestyle. And it was specially annoying having to hear from people that I didint need diet because I didn\u2019t need to loose weight, or judging me because I was eating salad everyday for work and stopped eating sweets. This is specially harming when you need to do something that is hard but necessary and keep hearing this comments. But it was scary, still is, pcos is a bit&$&.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t like the conversation or person talking, you can remove yourself from it. But disagreeing with her doesn\u2019t give you the right to police what she says. You also don\u2019t know enough about her to make the judgements you did.", "I'm going to say NTA based purely on the fact that she keeps refusing to respect everyone's boundaries, as you have all told her to stop discussing her weight but she continues to do so. Her behaviour is highly unprofessional- nobody should be discussing such personal matters in a work environment (unless their job involves nutrition). You should speak to HR and explain she is creating a hostile work environment and see if they can ping round an email to the office (without naming her) to explain that the office is a professional environment and certain topics are not appropriate.", "\n\nNTA. While it may not have been the nicest way to phrase it, you had valid reason to be frustrated with the conversation. You knew that what your coworker was saying about her weight was false and she was pushing the conversation despite being told to change the subject. You were responding to a frustrating situation and you weren't mean like she was by deliberately ignoring the requests of her coworkers.", "NTA.  While your response wasn't ideal, she is intentionally pushing your buttons. She's attempting to create a hostile work environment. Please document every incident. Then, file a case with HR. You don'thave to pursue it immediately, but have it documented.\n\nIgnore those who say you're to blame here. Your coworker is exhibiting targeted passive-aggressive behavior. It's obvious. Mentioning obesity repeatedly around someone who struggles with it is only accepted by others because they blame the obese person and feel they are justified targets. It's not abuse because obese people deserve it.\n\nYOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS.  Please keep reminding  yourself of this.", "NTA, OP, from my viewpoint it appears to me that your new employee is trying to power trip and is obliquely targeting you in order to make herself look good. She is so very very wrong here. What she has accomplished is making herself look shallow and callous. Your coworkers obviously noticed that and tried to shut her down. Apparently she is a slow learner.", "NTA. It's not a big deal to tell someone to shut up. She was even told to change the subject. Maybe she needed to be told to shut up", "Thank you for everyone for you're input. I see a bit more clearly, even though I still think it is a gray situation where me and her could have been nicer.\n\nI just wanted to add a few things that I didn't put first, so the post won't be too long.\n\n1 - she seems to always talk about her weight either when I'm around, or when R is around.  At least, that is what I have been told from a colleague. \n\n2 - I didn't want to say it, but R is my spouse. We have been together for 7 years almost.  He is, hopefully, the father of my future children and we plan on getting married next spring or summer. She knows he is my spouse.\n\n4 - I phrased it weird and I apologize. I didn't mean that because she is thin she doesn't have PCOS or diabetes (my little brother is thin and diabetic) or is healthy. What I mean that it is obviously a lie is that her weight is the reason of her disease like she claims (the difference between correlation and causation). I must admit I'm worried that she might have an ED more than anything.  Plus, she said that she went to her doctor's office at 8pm, that's why I found it super weird (I don't know any doctors' office open that late, unless she went to the emergency room?). \n\nNevertheless, my guts are still telling me to apologize for the snapping, but probably discuss with her the boundaries that she overstep of not only me, but everyone who asks her to stop.\n\nAnd if she does it again, I will have no choice to see HR I guess...", "YTA--I have a feeling that your coworkers assume that she shouldn't talk about weight in front of the coworker that is class III obese/super morbidly obese.  I am willing to bet that employee talks about her weight a lot.  My female friends talk about food/weight to varying degrees all the time.  That's how a lot of women are.  Desserts show up in the office, it's very common to hear \"Oh I really shouldn't!  I'm already gaining 10 pounds from just smelling it!\"\n\nIt's none of your business what her personal health history is.  That you're accusing her of lying seems like you are way too into her business.  If you're comfortable with your weight, the convos should be maybe annoying at worst but not so big that you have to tell her to shut up.  How unprofessional by the way.  You're also talking about going to HR but supposedly the weight convos don't bother you?  I have a feeling they do bother you or you wouldn't take it so personal.\n\nInstead of going to HR, you can't just say to her \"Sometimes I think you're talking about weight/food as some sort of jab at me...\"\n\nI've been doing keto since January.  I was 5'1\" and 179.  I am now 137.  I want to talk about food/progress etc all the time but I'm constantly trying to be mindful who I am around.  I try not to say anything in front of my friend who has an ED.  I also don't talk about it in front of a friend who just had a baby three weeks ago or anyone else that is overweight and I'm not sure how they will take it.  Seems like you're only freely allowed to talk about food/diet/exercise if you're in great shape and only around other great shape people or not happy and overweight around other people that are also not happy and overweight.  It's basically like walking on eggshells.\n\nIf you're truly happy with the way things are, I say let it all go and not make such an issue of it.  If you're not happy, perhaps figure out ways to improve your happiness by doing whatever that means to make you happy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am cognitively aware that my bmi is about 21 - that my waist is 26inches and that I am a small woman. But, usually when other bad things happen in life and I can\u2019t control them, I get overwhelmed by the perception of myself as \u2018fat\u2019 as \u2018too big\u2019 I have this intense inner bodily perception of being able to feel my own fat clinging to my muscles like a parasite. My arms, thighs and stomach become, suddenly and inexplicably \u2018flabby looking\u2019 to me saggy, too pale, untoned, too soft, disproportionately big. Wrong, bad, bad, bad. Must fix it. Too fat. It\u2019s really overwhelming. \n\nI am also really easily triggered by other people who express disordered eating behaviours. OR people who in the weird animal-lizard part of my brain, I assume have eating disorders (people who are very very thin or very very fat). \n\nIt\u2019s really messed up. I\u2019m lucky that I am fairly academic, and as such have read almost every essay I have been able to get my hands on about anorexia and can, for the most part, mediate and control my behaviours when the disorder is triggered into an impulse reaction. \n\nI know if I was bothering someone, and I do still, if I am close enough to someone and trust them deeply, allow myself to say things like \u2018I feel so fat\u2019 \u2018I am so fat\u2019 ect when the thoughts are present. The best way to get me to stop would be to speak to me like a human being, if I am harming you please let me know. Tell me what I am saying is causing you emotional harm. Because I\u2019m not trying to - I\u2019m just trying to ease the pressure from the inner eating disorder crazy by opening a valve a little. Also!! There is a chance she is saying this around you because of some instinct that you will understand. Two of my closest recovery allies are happy fat women who love their bodies, they\u2019ve had to unpick the fat phobia in society to be happy, and they see me being sick as an effect of the fat phobia in society and just. They are great they get it, they make me feel safe to have my illness and still be seen as a person. The things society tells them about their bodies my brain tells me about mine. So in a way we share a pain and understanding of each other. \n\nI don\u2019t feel I have enough context to judge the situation you are personally in. But I wanted to share the inner experiences I have as someone who lives with an ever present anorexia demon, to help you maybe try and have some empathy for what this person might be experiencing.", "hmm.. ESH..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut given with this further information - i would totally take it personally.
