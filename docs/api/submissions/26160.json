It was prom season and while there\u2019s many places to find dresses in my home town, there\u2019s one shop that most of the girls use every year. I was so excited to finally get to go and see what all the hype was about. My sisters and I get there and right off the bat I can see a clear difference in energy between the employees helping my sisters and the employee helping me. She looks at me and says \u201cwe don\u2019t really have many dresses in your size but I\u2019ll see what I can find\u201d she comes back with a plain black dress and tells me to try it on in the dressing room alone. Even though all the other girls are being fitted by the workers helping them. I tell her it\u2019s too big on me and she says that\u2019s all they have for my body type and that I\u2019d probably just have to shop elsewhere..I\u2019m of course taken a back as I\u2019m not much larger than my sisters who seem to have many dress options. I walk out crying and call my mom who suggests I just go to the David\u2019s bridal across town. Luckily when I arrived and told the employee helping me there what had happened, she was so supportive and wanted to make sure I found the perfect dress. She even found dresses with a little stretch so I could \u201ctell anyone who asks that you\u2019re wearing a size 6 which that dress shop definitely carries\u201d I was closer to an 8 lol. So I get a great dress and head home where I decide to leave a review for the initial dress shop as clearlyyy they had options that would\u2019ve worked for me but the employee felt the need to body shame me and claim they didn\u2019t and in my opinion wanted me to think I was bigger than I really am. After I did so, lots of my family and friends were upset with me for leaving such a bad review for a small locally owned shop. I get that its not some big corporation that\u2019s not affected by reviews but I felt my review was valid???

I mean, going into a petite store when you're a plus is not going to go well but an 8 is prettttttty common really.  oy vey.  Yeah let that review stand.
