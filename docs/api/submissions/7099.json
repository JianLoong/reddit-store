I have to admit that i'm strict in his education, but I want nothing but the best for him, and to have the academic opportunities I didn't have. My wife and I are very proud of him.\n\nI think one of the reasons why he is so successful is because we don't allow anything that might distract him from his studies, we also hire tutors and private professors and after school activities. Some people might say this is too much but he never complained or rebelled, so we think we are doing it well.\n\nHowever, this christmas my brother came to visit in the morning, he came with a wrapped box for my son. and other little gifts for our younger children. He gave the box to my son, just to find out, is a PS4. He explained that bought a PS5 and this was his previous PS4, so he gave it to my son, because of his grades. I said nothing at the moment, they plugged it into the TV and started playing a bit. Later my brother went to the kitchen and we spoke in private. I told him that videogames might distract my son from his studies, and should have discussed it with me beforehand. He brushed it off, saying that he is doing ok and that won't distract him.\n\nThe following days he used that console almost every moment he was awaken, and even let his little brothers play too. After the New year, when he was closer to go back to his private classes, he was still playing many hours a day. I warned him that if this behavior continues after his privates classes restarted the PS4 will be gone. He begged me not to take it away and promised to do not play that many hours.\n\nHe started his private classes and will be back to school soon, however, he has still been playing after coming back from his classes, saying that he finished his assignments, but I see him way too distracted. So while he was out of home, I took and PS4 and sold it, previous online listing. He wasn't happy at all when he found out, but I told him that is was a distraction to him and didn't keep his promise. Then he told everything to my brother, who insulted me over the phone for selling a christmas gift, I told him this was his fault for gifting a videogame without talking to me first.\n\nMy son is focused on his studies again, but isn't talking to me, and even my wife is saying I was too harsh I should trust him more. Our other kids are also avoiding me and pretending to be busy when I enter the same room as them.\n\nEdit: Too many people are giving me YTA and being hostile. Ok, I'll try to apologize to him. Maybe I could buy him a smartphone, let him use it 3 hours a day, so he can watch movies or even game on that. Would that be OK?", "created_utc": 1673478234, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109ix8p/aita_i_sold_the_ps4_my_brother_gave_to_my_son_for/", "score": 316, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because that's the problem here, and he WILL crash and burn once he's in college if you don't start more balanced parenting right now. Take this as a massive red flag it is. \n\nYTA", "YTA and probably have been for years. It sounds like your son doesn\u2019t have any recreation or interests other than what you dictate.

Speaking as a former child in the same circumstances of your child (overbearing parent focused on academics), that doesn't always work out the way you want it to. I was the smartest kid in school. My parents never let me do anything \"fun.\" Once I went off to college, I figured out I don't actually like school. I still graduated, but in a major of my own choosing and I went off into a career my parents never imagined. I'm happy while they're still lamenting over my career choices. And you know what? I don't give a single crap what they think. I also barely talk to them now because they never bothered to forge an actual relationship with me when I was a child. Grades were more important to them than me. \n\nSo all I gotta say is stop being an AH and appreciate your child for whoever they might be. Stop forcing your own wants onto them. /endrant", "I wouldn't be surprised if your son goes no contact with you the second he can. you sound horribly controlling. Let your child be a child.

Have you ever allowed you kid to be.. a kid? This has happened because, by withholding normal childhood experiences, *you* never gave him the opportunity to find a healthy balance between work and play.\n\nThe second he is no longer under your control, he will make up for lost time. Good for him.", "Who care if your son was distracted? Why not wait until you saw his grades to make the determination that his studies were suffering?\n\nYTA and he will never forget this", "My god you are such a fucking asshole.\n\nExpect your kid to cut contact the second he can. \n\nFuck you dude.\n\nEdit: no, OP . A smartphone is not a ps4. Replace what you sold out from under him.", "yup, YTA.   There is ZERO issue in limiting game time.   Even an hour a day on the weekend.   Congrats, your kid is going to attend a great college.   And hate his parents.", "YTA \n\nMy in-laws did this to my husband. He was an all A student and finished 3rd in his class at a top private school and they still wouldn\u2019t let him play. \n\nNow? \n\nHe plays video games almost to his detriment now because he never got to be a kid. He never learned to regulate fun. \n\nHe also only speaks to his dad one day a year and only sees his mom maybe once every other year. Oh, he also went absolutely wild once he got some freedom and away from them. \n\nThis will be what to expect in the future. Get the poor kid his ps4 again and let him be a child. He\u2019s not your robot to control.", "YTA. Instead of letting your kid have some time being a kid and enjoying a present from his uncle, you once again prioritized school over balance/happiness.\n\nInstead of developing a healthy relationship with hobbies and school, you dictated to your child.\n\nInstead of letting your child develop self-control, you controlled them.\n\nI could go on but...can't wait to see what your kid posts in Reddit when he posts \"my dad controlled every single aspect of my life, can I go no contact?\"", "YTA. Sorry. I\u2019m 36 and was a gifted student, (still a) card carrying MENSA member. \n\nA little joy goes a long way. I stay stressed out and have people pleasing issues because I was never allowed to be a child. I\u2019m working through it but I would hate to see someone suffer like me. It\u2019s almost as though a majority of my brain/thinking patterns were very mature/advanced in academic areas while the social and joyful parts were lacking. \n\nSilly analogy: I\u2019m better at calculus and studying but can\u2019t even do a chicken dance at a wedding. Balance is key.", "Oh, you are very definitely the AH. The PS4 wasn't yours to sell, it was your son's. So you stole his PS4 and sold it. If you did nothing else wrong, YTA. But wait, there's more!\n\nYou leave your son with literally nothing else to do but his studies. This is going to backfire on you in a spectacular way. First, he's going to resent the hell out of you, and very likely will go LC or NC. \n\nBut (as you are probably brushing off the first one as \"oh, that won't happen, I'm doing it for himmmm\") the bigger thing that you might actually care about is: you are setting your son up for failure. If he never learns for himself how to budget time, as soon as you are not hyper-controlling every minute of his life, he is not going to know what to do. He will likely flunk out of school, and all of your work and effort and money and pride will be for nought. \n\nYou need to back WAY off, and start letting your son learn how to learn. He also needs to learn how to set his own goals for life, instead of only being allowed to pursue your goals for him. IF you're lucky, he won't completely cut you off as soon as he's able, and you might be able to salvage your relationship with your other children. \n\nAnd buy him another PS4 to make up for the one that you very, VERY wrongly stole from him and sold.", "Oh dear.  You should have at least given it back to your brother and let him decide what to do with it.  Or, better yet, place more limits on your son using it.  Kids need an outlet.  It sounds like your son doesn't have one.  Does he do anything else besides \"school\"?  \n\nSchool has barely been back for a week, and you already sold his Christmas present... probably the best one he's ever gotten.  \n\nYTA.  Poor kid.", "Wow. YTA. I feel sad for your son. \n\nWhy was managing the amount of time he played not an option? Why couldn\u2019t you set a rule that he is allowed to play for 1 hour a day after his schoolwork is finished? Or that he could only play it for a set amount of time on the weekends? Why did you jump to selling a gift that was given to him? For someone who is such a strict parent, this sounds like lazy parenting on your part. \n\nLife is about more than school and work. Your son deserves to have fun and enjoyment in his life too.\n\nOf course he\u2019s not talking to you. Maybe get used to that for when he\u2019s an adult and no longer under your control.", "YTA\n\nYour son may not say it out loud but I'm sure the kid hates studying all the time and probably resents you. Kid finally has an outlet that makes him happy and you take it away from him.\n\nDon't be shocked when the kid rebels later in life.", ">he never complained\n\nWould you listen if he did\n\nyta", "YTA. You are pushing your kid to achieve a standard that you yourself do not have. It does not sound like this kid has any down time from studying. This is why kids commit suicide.", "Good grief, I don\u2019t like kids being on devices all the time and even I think YTA.  He\u2019s a teenager, not a toddler.  You took something that brought him joy and sold it.  You sound like the Burgermeister Meisterburger.  Congrats.\n\nOh, and he never rebelled because he never had time!  Do you even let him play sports or do ANYTHING other than study?  You realize that even gifted kids get burned out and in fact often flounder in college or severely underperform, right?  And that you won\u2019t actually be able to force him into a prestigious career?  I mean what will you do if he decides he wants to major in something you disapprove of?", "Your son has taken the first step on the road to no contact with the old man.\n\nGood for him.\n\nStop trying to live your lost dreams through your son. It never works.\n\nYou\u2019re putting unbearable pressure on this kid. He\u2019ll either rebel and break away or he\u2019ll break.\n\nYTA \n\nTerrible parent\n\nOh, by the way, what did you do with the money you got for selling your son\u2019s property?", "YTA. Of course he was playing it lots, he was excited about his Christmas present. \n\nYou do allow your children to actually have fun sometimes, yes? What is the problem with him using his fun time to play it? Removing the console completely is a real AH move, you didn't even give your son chance to prove that it wouldn't impact his studies during school time.", "YTA let him have some joy. He will be fine and learn time management", "YTA - It sounds like you are working your child too hard. Kids (And anyone else for that matter), need to be able to chill out every so often. \n\nLimiting the time on the PS4 is right and there's parental controls that could have aided in that, but you've jumped to selling it.\n\nIt sounds to me that you don't like games consoles, assumed it would ruin your child's focus and were waiting for any opportunity to get rid of it.\n\nCan I ask what you have done with the money from the sale of the console? That cash is rightly your son's.", "YTA - main reason is you sold his gift.  You could have unplugged it and set windows when he can play.", "YTA Why could you have not utilized parental controls to limit his time playing? And did you not believe him when he said he had finished his assignments? There are ways to check that, you know. Did you at least give him the money from the sale?\n\nI don't think you taught him the lesson you think you did. If anything, he's probably cemented in his head that he's moving out - and not looking back - when he turns 18.\n\nAre you sure you aren't emotionally abusive?", "YTA, if my brother sold the gift I gave his son, let's just say he'd either be getting my nephew a new ps5 or needing a specialist doctor to remove my boot from his ass.", "YTA for numerous reasons, not the least of which is selling something given to your son. Add to that being a control freak and not teaching your son how to balance his life, making him think school and grades are everything, that kid will probably have issues once he moves out and experiences life.", "YTA, he\u2019s focusing on avoiding you more than anything is my guess.", "YTA, what the butt is wrong with you. Give the child a break for goodness sake.", "YTA You, as the parent, could have restricted his play time instead of outright selling the console. Say \"Time's up\" and when the console is off, take the power cord or the HDMI cord so he can't play without permission. Your kid is going to resent you for putting so much pressure on him. Let him relax a little and be a kid.\n\nEdit: Did you at least give him the money? It was his Christmas gift, and you essentially stole it.", "YTA.

Good job on losing a son and setting him up for failure. You are a horrible helicopter parent.\n\nHe's not learning how to deal with mistakes while still in a safe environment where mistakes are small i.e. school.

It was wrong of your brother not to ask, but you can take controllers away, set time limits, take the power cord, etc. Have you considered maybe he played it so much initially because he doesn't seem to have other outlets for hobbies and personal time? The way you describe the whole setup with tutors and everything, burnout at some point for your son seems likely.", "Yea, that's how you get a son that's gonna go NC or LC once he's able to move out... **YTA**. I can't tell you why he hasn't complained, maybe because he wanted to make you both proud, but taking away any joy and fun from him is not okay. That doesn't help at all.\n\nThe worst thing some parents can do, who weren't able to achieve what they want, is push those dreams onto their children, believing it's the right thing, but truthfully, most of the time it's the parent wanting to live through their kid. You need to stop. Let your son decide what he wants for the future and how. Give him freedom.\n\nI am not too sure, but might be me asking for INFO: Are you sure he never received a consequence for not meeting a goal? Because depending on what it was and if he has, that's why he might not say anything, but maybe talks to his uncle more than he does to you. Because he might know the response he gets already.\n\nEdit: He enjoyed playing and I highly doubt it impacted his grades at all - his free time is free time. He has study AND free time. I hope so at least... If not, that's terrible. He needs free time to be a kid!", "So the first week back to school, you don\u2019t even know if his grades are affected, but just because you are a horrible dad you sell his gift?

And you need to replace EXACTLY what you STOLE and SOLD.", "YTA there were many ways to go about this, and you definitely chose wrong. You could tell your son it is a weekend only toy. You could have given it back to your brother and asked him to hold onto it until summer. You do realize he is 15 years old and in a few years he will most likely be going to college, don't you? Most likely some of his friends will have gaming systems and he will be spending a good amount of time playing on it. This would have been the time to teach him balance, something that would be helpful for him to have learned before getting all of this freedom when in college.", "YTA.

You admit that he is great with time management, has great grades, and is great with deadlines. Do you LET him have hobbies, like, at all?

You could've set a timer and say he can only play that many hours a day/only on weekends/holidays\n3- you're not letting your kid be a kid and when he's an adult he'll realize he didn't have a childhood or adolescence and try to relive it.
