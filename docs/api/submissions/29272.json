She sent me a bunch of question marks then eventually got the hint and told me that I\u2019m being bitter and I\u2019m going to turn my brother into an unlikeable asshole. I ignored her.

What a monster!!!!   I mean the aunt and cousins of cause.  It's an awesome trip that most kids look forward to.  The cousins might just be burned out from all those trips and the cinderella family can't enjoy a day at the palace.  Let him enjoy .... he's 6!!!", "NTA, but here's the thing I will never understand.  If someone outside a disagreement tries to enter the conflict, why is that even entertained?  Tell all those people that this doesn't concern them.\n\nRegardless, you have done nothing wrong and it's awesome that your little brother is still over the moon about his summer trip.  I love that.", "NTA, your aunt is though for holding a grudge for 20 plus years against your mom and hurting her kids for it, only to play the victim when it bites her in the ass. Who tries to guilt an older sibling into telling their 6 yo sibling to not be so happy because it makes her look bad? Your aunt is a spiteful appearance driven person whose opinion should be given no heed.", "NTA I would tell the cousins everything was fine until Auntie B decided to stir the pot.\nWhy don\u2019t you tell your cousins that your aunt is still bitter about a high school boyfriend and that is why is punished your Mom\u2019s children by never invited them. \nThat is something awful to do to children who have no understanding they were just left out. \nAsk them why was it perfectly ok to discuss the trips Auntie took them on at family gatherings? You were being punished a second time! Now once your Auntie sees that you all had a lot of fun and it makes her mad that she couldn\u2019t destroy it. Now she wants to act like your selfish and turn family members against you. Ask them why is this still an issue? Sorry Auntie you got dumped but life goes on.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to justify doing something nice for your brother. Now you\u2019re starting to see how they all held it against you mom for taking your aunts bf and now, they\u2019ll gladly turn on you too. Family sometimes is toxic and being an adult is sometimes seeing this.", "She was the nicest person ever - to them.\n\nNTA everyone has to manage their expectations around their aunt's inability to buy Disney merch.

To your cousins: \"I am obeying the lessons she taught me on my Disney trip, just like  you are.  She isn't nice to me.  She doesn't get points for being respectful by using me against my mother by usurping her parenting. Now can we change the topic?\nYou have nothing to do with my relationship with my aunt and I don't like gossip. \n\nTo your aunt.  \"I really don't appreciate you maligning me to my cousins.  Your pettiness is remarkable. I'm not discussing this further, and any other conversations about myself or my brother should be routed through our parents.  I have already informed Mom of our previous conversations so she can protect my brother.\" *block*", "NTA\n\nA 6 year old is still thrilled about a trip months later. That's like every parent's dream. You guys did something amazing for you brother and he's thrilled about it still, every adult in his life should be encouraging that, not discouraging it. \n\nSeparately, your aunt is a massive AH for basically cutting out your mother and, in many ways, her children over a teenage love triangle decades ago.", "NTA. You sound like an awesome older sibling and I'm sorry your mom and aunt weren't able to have as good of a relationship with each other as it sounds like you've got with your little brother.", "NTA-I\u2019m sorry your aunt never learned to be kind.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is, though. She has been doing this to get even with your mom for apparently decades and she wants you to get over it? I'm a little amazed by your restraint. You could have easily pointed out her hypocrisy, but you didn't. You could have gone on about her letting your cousins brag about their trips, and never teaching THEM to be kinder (if you know what I mean). And she is still taking the other cousins on trips but ignoring your brother. Wtf is wrong with her? And your cousins are obviously still spoiled brats to think they should get involved and defend her for being an ass.\n\nI'd be writing a very long post to everyone explaining why giving your brother this incredibly generous gift is okay, and him being over the moon about it is okay, and that they have no right to tell him to stop when none of them ever stopped. Hypocrisy seems to be a family trait in your extended family, but fortunately seems to have skipped you.", "NTA, this sounds like your aunt is mad that she / her children aren't the centre of attention for once.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I would have clearly outlined her behavior and stated that you would say something to him only after she started treating him the same way she treats his cousins. Then block her", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust ignore your aunt.", "NTA- You can ask them how they even know about that since you never complained about it to them.\n\nI mean if you were really being so bitter, wouldn't you've complained about it to all your cousins.

You don't say whether your father is the boyfriend she stole, but regardless,  that had to leave a sour taste.\n\nYou are NTA for treating your brother, and as he is 6, and this is the first real treat he has had, it makes sense for him to show his excitement.

She has been holding a teenagers actions against her for how many years?  This is ridiculous feud she could have stopped long ago.  Your mother is the reason you did not get to go on trips.

You are holding the wrong person responsible for you being excluded all these years.", "Just block her???", "NTA  \nYour aunt is a despicable human being.

Screw that!!   \nIf you have any rational family members try to get them to understand the position you have been in all your life.
