This year he wanted KFC. He is at the after school program until 5:30. My wife already went and got the food and had skipped out of the room to start decorating the family room for his party. He invited over like 6 of his friends so my wife spent over $100 on this food. \n\nWell, when I wasn't looking my dog got in to the food and managed to wolf at least half of it down. I was in a panic because of the chicken bones, but my wife was absolutely furious and told me to \"get my fucking mutt out of her house\". She had to call a day in advance to get this much food and now her son's party was \"ruined\", as well as her being out money because of my dog. I completely ignored her honestly and just rushed my dog to the vet to be seen. \n\nWhen I was there she sent me this text: \"Do not even dare bring that fucking animal back to my house. I never wanted that dog here and you forced me in to an environment where I'm now terrorized daily by your unruly, untrained fucking mutt. Your failure to train that fucking animal has left this family miserable. You try bringing that dog back here and I will proceed with file divorce papers. I WILL be taking back the money you now owe me from your share of our combined finances.\" My only response was telling her she's being psychotic over KFC and she had better not touch my money because I'm not paying for that. She never responded, however my buddy is saying I'm definitely the AH because my wife has been vocal since day one that she doesn't want the dog in her house and has been asking me to re-home the dog since I got her. AITA? (My dog is an ESA and she's fine, by the way. But my wife thinks my \"excuse\" of her being an ESA \"doesn't mean shit\" to her because she's convinced I didn't say I needed one until well after she said she didn't want a dog here).\n\nETA: the wife came before the dog.

After reading your comments you\u2019re basically full of shit. \n\nYou got a dog and didn\u2019t train it. Regardless if you *needed it* responsible dog owners train their animals.

Then didn\u2019t train it, and then you don\u2019t watch it to make sure it doesn\u2019t cause turmoil. Was your wife\u2019s reaction OTT, sure.

As a dog owner (who totally understands your valid fears about eating the cooked chicken bones and hopes your dog is okay), you are at fault. You brought a dog into a home it wasn\u2019t wanted by everyone, and you e clearly failed to train it properly. You\u2019re giving ESA a bad name by ignoring your responsibility as an owner/handler. The dog should have been trained to never touch food on a table, or should have been contained away from the food/party. \n\nSounds like you\u2019ve chosen your dog over the family at every turn, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the family doesn\u2019t like you and your untrained dog.", "YTA.

Because, unlike you, the dog is entirely innocent in this situation. But you're such a raging asshole that I just can't do it.\n\nFirstly, you had absolutely no right to get a dog and move it into your wife's house (you said it's hers) without her being fully on board with it.\n\nSecondly, ESA dog? Emotional support animals should be trained. This is clearly one of those situations where someone just uses that label to justify bringing their dog everywhere, and they can't be bothered to deal with any training or obedience. And that's another huge issue, this dog's behavior is clearly problematic and your wife's comments make it clear this isn't the first time there's been trouble.\n\nThirdly, YOUR money?! It's shared money. But YOU are obligated to reimburse her for the food YOUR dog stole.\n\nAnd she's not psychotic. She's fed up with you and all your BS. And honestly, I hope she takes her share of the funds and hires herself a good divorce lawyer.\n\nETA: If you're the kind of person who gets a dog and then demands someone else takes care of it (you definitely fit the mold) then if you actually give a damn about that dog re-home it with someone who will actually take proper care of it.", "#YTA, and I hope she divorces your ungrateful ass over this.\n\nShe gave you an ultimatum over your untrained \"emotional support animal\" terrorising her son's party and you responded to her not only by refusing to pay for the damages out of your shared bank account, but also by gaslighting her and calling her psychotic.\n\nThis doesn't sound like an isolated incident either, and it's clear that your wife has had a long list of problems with the dog you brought over. An ESA would be properly trained. Running off to chow down $100 worth of KFC doesn't sound like the behaviour of a trained canine.\n\n_______\n\n**EDIT: OP, I have read some of your replies in the thread. You are a terrible husband and you really are competing with some of the biggest assholes in the subreddit's history.

If the dog's not trained, you'd have to keep your eye on it constantly, which you failed to do.

Your wife is not psychotic over KFC, she's pissed because this is the last straw for her with your unruly dog. You shouldn't have gotten a dog in the first place.

If you were going to steamroll your wife into a dog she didn't want, you most definitely should have taken the effort to train it properly. I have a 75# dog who is highly food motivated, but she is also well trained.

And yeah, you're right, people seem to really be abusing the ESA label.", "I mean to say that they must be trained. They don\u2019t need specialized training in the way service animals don\u2019t, but they have to be trained. Housebroken, obedient, non-aggressive, and importantly not a danger or major disruption to the people around you. This dog would never be approved by any mental health professional as an ESA because it is legally required that an ACTUAL mental health professional provide an official letter stating that the animal is an ESA and why (depression, anxiety, etc.). I\u2019m not denying that the guy is attached to the dog, but if he doesn\u2019t care enough to actually train it and respect the ESA system, he\u2019s in the wrong.", "Oh well just saw a comment documenting all the other incidents of the dog being aggressive. Yeah not cool. And being an ESA is no excuse! Also even though ESAs certain rights for housing, I doubt it would restrict the landlord from charging for any physical damage it would cause if the animal was destructive.", "fish require quite a bit of time too unfortunately", "Oh honey no, fish keeping is one of the most expensive hobbies out there! Saying as someone who keeps freaking common goldfish. The money stacks up REAL quick.", "Fish take wayyy more effort than a cat with wayyy less cuddles IMO. Man, wait until after that first water change or algae overgrowth", "Lol my mom thought about this and had us read books about keeping fish and then we never ended up doing it because it seemed way too complicated.\n\nWe got cats instead.", "You clearly don\u2019t know anything about fish. The cat is easier. Agree to feed it and make the husband and kids scoop the box.", "Oh dear they better not want oscars or goldfish or anything saltwater.\n\nBTW, if you do get fish - read up on Everything from cycling to reliable filters from reputable online sources and then stock the (properly cycled!) tank to eventually about 1/4 of whatever stock capacity you calculated.  You\u2019ll have SO many fewer expensive problems.\n\nA 40 gallon breeder tank (Petco $1/gallon now Half Off sale yo) with a light stock load is less expensive in the long run than a heavily stocked 10 gallon that needs meds and new fish every month.", "While you\u2019re technically correct, I do think that\u2019s a ridiculous standard. I absolutely love dogs and have always had a dog. Just the thought of living with an untrained dog, of constantly having to guard my food, clean up messes, and worry about how they\u2019ll behave with others gives me intense secondhand stress. I can\u2019t fathom how someone could put up with that and yet still claim they\u2019re getting more emotional benefit than harm from their animal.", "See yall there!", "Although a dog shouldn\u2019t eat cooked chicken bones, it\u2019s not a dire emergency if a dog eats cooked chicken bones. Just watch them, and if they show signs of gastric distress, like vomiting or diarrhea, then take them to the vet. Dogs rarely need to see the vet after eating chicken bones, so it wasn\u2019t a freak out emergency. It was a watch and observe the dog situation.", "Yes I should have said- *should* be trained. \n\nIt\u2019s just with an ESA vs a Pet, there\u2019s more incentive for them to be trained since you\u2019re relying on them for support in stressful situations. \n\nMore reason to believe it was totally a manipulation tactic.", "And you're required to have a doctor's note saying the animal is an ESA. A vest and note someone bought online is not sufficient. \n\nSigned, someone with a very well trained ESA.", "Target would not be penalyzed for kicking that lady out. That dog was a liability and destroying property. I work in customer service and it sucks that even though we would be in the right, management doesnt want the hassle. People abuse this leniency all the time. I had a guys dog take a dump the other day. He came and told me what aisle it was in and walked off. My manager went to clean it up but we were told the wrong place. Employees searching the store for dog shit. Dogs really need to be trained to go into public places. \n\nMy dogs are trained. I can leave a full plate on the coffee table untouched. The dogs just go lay on the couch. Its doable.", "And money, aquarium aficionados can spend real fast", "It can, but we are not going to shell out several hundred dollars for vet bills, we've discussed limiting the kind of fish we're buying, fish food is significantly less expensive than big bags of dog food (my partner has always loved big dogs). As a Magic: The Gathering player in fully aware of how expensive a hobby can get, but I also know it can be kept reasonable as long as you're trying to keep it reasonable.", "Being very allergic to cats eliminated that one from contention in the pet category unfortunately, otherwise we may have ended up with one.", "Normally I agree. I would just be concerned by the amount he ate. \n\nI would call my vet and ask if I needed to bring him in rather than rush right over.", "That's fair! And my brother has probably spent thousands over the years on MTG \ud83d\ude05", "I stopped chasing cards in packs years ago lol, I've always been very strict about my budget for Magic... But lord if I had a ton of money to play with lol", "That\u2019s us, too expensive to pack chase these days, I have kids and bills now"]}
