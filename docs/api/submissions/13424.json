This year he wanted KFC. He is at the after school program until 5:30. My wife already went and got the food and had skipped out of the room to start decorating the family room for his party. He invited over like 6 of his friends so my wife spent over $100 on this food. \n\nWell, when I wasn't looking my dog got in to the food and managed to wolf at least half of it down. I was in a panic because of the chicken bones, but my wife was absolutely furious and told me to \"get my fucking mutt out of her house\". She had to call a day in advance to get this much food and now her son's party was \"ruined\", as well as her being out money because of my dog. I completely ignored her honestly and just rushed my dog to the vet to be seen. \n\nWhen I was there she sent me this text: \"Do not even dare bring that fucking animal back to my house. I never wanted that dog here and you forced me in to an environment where I'm now terrorized daily by your unruly, untrained fucking mutt. Your failure to train that fucking animal has left this family miserable. You try bringing that dog back here and I will proceed with file divorce papers. I WILL be taking back the money you now owe me from your share of our combined finances.\" My only response was telling her she's being psychotic over KFC and she had better not touch my money because I'm not paying for that. She never responded, however my buddy is saying I'm definitely the AH because my wife has been vocal since day one that she doesn't want the dog in her house and has been asking me to re-home the dog since I got her. AITA? (My dog is an ESA and she's fine, by the way. But my wife thinks my \"excuse\" of her being an ESA \"doesn't mean shit\" to her because she's convinced I didn't say I needed one until well after she said she didn't want a dog here).\n\nETA: the wife came before the dog.

As a dog owner (who totally understands your valid fears about eating the cooked chicken bones and hopes your dog is okay), you are at fault. You brought a dog into a home it wasn\u2019t wanted by everyone, and you e clearly failed to train it properly. You\u2019re giving ESA a bad name by ignoring your responsibility as an owner/handler. The dog should have been trained to never touch food on a table, or should have been contained away from the food/party. \n\nSounds like you\u2019ve chosen your dog over the family at every turn, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the family doesn\u2019t like you and your untrained dog.", "YTA.

Emotional support animals should be trained. This is clearly one of those situations where someone just uses that label to justify bringing their dog everywhere, and they can't be bothered to deal with any training or obedience. And that's another huge issue, this dog's behavior is clearly problematic and your wife's comments make it clear this isn't the first time there's been trouble.\n\nThirdly, YOUR money?! It's shared money. But YOU are obligated to reimburse her for the food YOUR dog stole.\n\nAnd she's not psychotic. She's fed up with you and all your BS. And honestly, I hope she takes her share of the funds and hires herself a good divorce lawyer.\n\nETA: If you're the kind of person who gets a dog and then demands someone else takes care of it (you definitely fit the mold) then if you actually give a damn about that dog re-home it with someone who will actually take proper care of it.", "#YTA, and I hope she divorces your ungrateful ass over this.\n\nShe gave you an ultimatum over your untrained \"emotional support animal\" terrorising her son's party and you responded to her not only by refusing to pay for the damages out of your shared bank account, but also by gaslighting her and calling her psychotic.\n\nThis doesn't sound like an isolated incident either, and it's clear that your wife has had a long list of problems with the dog you brought over. An ESA would be properly trained. Running off to chow down $100 worth of KFC doesn't sound like the behaviour of a trained canine.", "YTA\n\nThis is not about the KFC and it never was.", "YTA. 100%. Your wife did all that work and did everything to prepare for your stepson's birthday. Your untrained dog ruined it. Where is your concern for that? You absolutely owe her the money for it being ruined. I'm glad your dog is ok. Genuinely. But this happened because of you and the fact that your dog is untrained.

If the dog's not trained, you'd have to keep your eye on it constantly, which you failed to do.

This year he wanted KFC. He is at the after school program until 5:30. My wife already went and got the food and had skipped out of the room to start decorating the family room for his party. He invited over like 6 of his friends so my wife spent over $100 on this food. \n\nWell, when I wasn't looking my dog got in to the food and managed to wolf at least half of it down. I was in a panic because of the chicken bones, but my wife was absolutely furious and told me to \"get my fucking mutt out of her house\". She had to call a day in advance to get this much food and now her son's party was \"ruined\", as well as her being out money because of my dog. I completely ignored her honestly and just rushed my dog to the vet to be seen. \n\nWhen I was there she sent me this text: \"Do not even dare bring that fucking animal back to my house. I never wanted that dog here and you forced me in to an environment where I'm now terrorized daily by your unruly, untrained fucking mutt. Your failure to train that fucking animal has left this family miserable. You try bringing that dog back here and I will proceed with file divorce papers. I WILL be taking back the money you now owe me from your share of our combined finances.\" My only response was telling her she's being psychotic over KFC and she had better not touch my money because I'm not paying for that.

Getting a pet has to be a consensus decision. If one person in the marriage doesn't want it then the pet shouldn't come. If you were going to steamroll your wife into a dog she didn't want, you most definitely should have taken the effort to train it properly. I have a 75# dog who is highly food motivated, but she is also well trained. I can trust her 100% not to jump on counters to steal food and I also feel ok leaving food unattended within her reach when I leave the room briefly. It took some effort and she messed up sometimes, but I put in the effort and my dog knows not to take food that isn't given to her. This is not only to keep her away from my food, but also to keep her safe from eating things that might harm her, *like cooked chicken bones*. It's a disservice to your dog to not train them and can also put them at great risk.

I commented because I think it's helpful for people to realize the full extent of the differences between the two. People having poorly trained animals and feeling entitled to bring them into spaces under the guise of \"it's my ESA!\" is frustrating. I live with someone with a disability who has a real trained service animal, who has much more training than my kitty, who probably would never forgive me if I brought her on a plane LOL.
