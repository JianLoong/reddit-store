I thought by the title that you were going to describe something much more intense than literal sleeping. I'm not even sure I would call that \"PDA.\" I wouldn't object to a platonic friend resting their head on my shoulder. The lady was way out of line.", "NTA\n\nPretty sure she wouldn\u2019t have said this if you were a heterosexual couple. I\u2019m sorry for the distress this has caused you. \n\nI\u2019m petty but tbh I\u2019d have called her more than a creep", "NTA\n\nIf you'd been making out that would be one thing, but resting your head on your partner's shoulder is not PDA in that sense. \n\nPerhaps that woman would be more comfortable if she sealed her child in bubble wrap and secured them in a closet until they're 18.", "NTA. That wasn't even PDA. It was falling asleep using another person's shoulder as your pillow. I've had it happen with strangers on the train during a commute. One minute the dude beside me is nodding off, and the next minute his head is on my shoulder, which I then shrug to get him off.  My 19 year old daughter just did this recently as well on a long flight. Her head dropped down and I obviously left it there. The lady you spoke back to is clearly homophobic and a gigantic AH as well. She is a creep, no doubt about it.", "NTA. Even if she\u2019s not a creep for looking over, she\u2019s certainly pretty icky for making a big deal about someone\u2019s head on someone else\u2019s shoulder. I assumed you were going to say you had your tongue down his throat or something, if there was a fuss over it. This sounds wholesome and sweet, though I\u2019d personally guess that it was less about the PDA itself and more about the fact that you\u2019re both men. People suck.", "you are NOT! resting your head on his shoulder is sweet! nosy lady was just being homophobic. she would have had NO problem if one of you were opposite sex. feel for her kid!\n\nhave a blessed day!", "NTA - You are no way in the wrong here.  I would be hard pressed to not make comments back at her since her position is absolutely nuts.  However escalating anything on a flight with a crazy person like her feels like a bad idea so maybe you should have held back.  I feel sorry for that kid though!", "NTA. That woman is a helicopter mom too invested in the lives of random strangers whose bodies are simply touching. She is wrong, not you.", "NTA.\n\nSleeping on someone's shoulder, how *SCANDALOUS*! \\*clutches pearls\\* \n\nSeriously, though, you weren't blatantly making out in front of people, you were using him for a pillow so you didn't wake up with an awful crick in your neck. People do that all the time.", "NTA.\n\nI would not consider this level/ammount of personal contact with another person as inapropriate PDA (I mean, if you had your share of long flights or overnight bus travels you probably did this with the person who sat by your side even if you do not know each other). And I belive that nowadays there are airlines that offer couple seats in the business class (and some of these seats can became a double bed).\n\nThis woman is a creep and looks like she \"corrupted\" her child to act/peep like her.", "NTA.  There is no scenario where you could traumatize a child by doing this.  She is homophobic, nosy and totally the ah here.  Please don\u2019t give it another thought.", "NTA. You just met a normal, everyday, homophobic nasty piece of work.", "NTA. Excessive pda? I frequently lay my head in my BFs lap and sleep on a plane. She\u2019d probably call the cops on that. Head on a shoulder is excessive pda? People are so strange.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think your head on his shoulder qualifies as PDA.  Clothed?  Hands in appropriate places?  All good.  Tell her to MYOB.", "man, calling this lady a \"creep\" was the *nicest* thing lol because I'm mad *for* you at her comments on corrupting her kid. Shes rude af.\n\nThey should both sit down and face the front!", "A stranger fell asleep next to me on a bus several years ago and ended up resting their head on my shoulder. I let them sleep, because I'm not a monster. **NTA** and I hope her homophobic ass steps on a LEGO in the dark while she has to pee really bad.", "NTA, should have asked her if she should be flying alone with a minor, especially if the poor kid is at risk of learning to be just as hateful and judgmental as she is.", "NTA. She should have minded her own business, especially since you were not bothering anyone. \n\nSome people really think everyone is out there trying to 'corrupt' their children. I was once watching Game of Thrones on my laptop on a plane, and a kid sitting a row behind me, stuck his head through the gap in the chairs to look at my laptop, after which the parents, rather than telling their kid off for bothering other passengers, scolded me for 'exposing' the kid to graphic scenes...", "NTA\n\nThat's not aggressive PDA as I would define it (think heavy kissing and groping, rather). Quite normal behavior. \n\nIf kid hadn't peeped past the PRIVACY BARRIER, he wouldn't have seen anything so lady needs to keep her own child in check.", "NTA it's none of her business and it isn't traumatic or problematic for a child to see that people care about each other and sleep on someones shoulder.", "NTA\n\nThat's not even PDA in my opinion- you were literally half asleep.  You definitely weren't creating any kind of spectacle and it was a wonderful opportunity for a teaching moment for the child, as in \"Lots of people take naps on airplanes and we should always mind our own business when someone isn't causing trouble.\"", "Nta\n\nHell I fell asleep on a total stranger\u2019s shoulder once (he was very cool about it thank god but it was embarrassing)", "\"so I leaned my head against his shoulder, snuggled and dozed off.\"\n\n*gasp* You absolute SLAG! Someone alert the village elders!\n\nNTA \ud83d\ude02", "No. She is the creep and she needed to hear it and if that was my kid I wouldn't of cared. I'd be more upset with my child not respecting other people's privacy.\nIt's not like you two were graphic with heavy petting and making out. You were snuggling up against him, pretty innocent if you ask me.\nAnd even if you were that's not her business. That child will be exposed to lots of things as they age and get older.\n\nThat mother thinks she was doing a service to her child but she really didn't. All she is teaching is showing affection out in the open is wrong. There's a level of what children should be exposed to, sure, when it's relative to sex. Cuddling is not.\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nShe and her kid creeped on your privacy, while likely expecting no such behaviour to infringe upon her own.\n\nI would have been more rude and I think you showed a lot of restraint.", "NTA. That wasn't PDA. I would be entirely cool with my brother leaning his head on me to sleep on a flight. I might even tolerate a stranger doing it if they looked exhausted enough!", "nta", "NTA. I thought you were making out", "NTA.", "NTA, fuck her & her homophobia. She wouldn't have considered it anything worthy of comment if you were a straight couple.", "NTA. She was being a creep, and my guess would be homophobic too.", "NTA. That wasn't even PDA. I've seen strangers wake up with their head on someone's shoulder. She was a nosy creep.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
