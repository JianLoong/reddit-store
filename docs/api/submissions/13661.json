Less than an hour later I was awoken by a lady speaking rather aggressively with my boyfriend. I asked my boyfriend what happened and he explained that her child had peeped over the separation and seen us.

That wasn't even PDA. It was falling asleep using another person's shoulder as your pillow. I've had it happen with strangers on the train during a commute. One minute the dude beside me is nodding off, and the next minute his head is on my shoulder, which I then shrug to get him off.  My 19 year old daughter just did this recently as well on a long flight. Her head dropped down and I obviously left it there.
