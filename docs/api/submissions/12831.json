He has complained very impolitely about this twice now, I have never met him, and do not know him as I just moved in about 6 months ago. \n\nMy truck does have an aftermarket exhaust on it, but I wouldn\u2019t consider it \u201cloud\u201d, this is the first time anyone has ever complained about it. So\u2026am I an asshole for starting my truck in the morning, and ignoring his complaining?\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nTo answer some of the info requests.  I installed the exhaust because the original needed replaced.  It is more durable and better made than the stock exhaust for about the same price.\n\nMy truck is not a diesel, it is a V6.  It is turbocharged, and from my understanding, it is helpful for longevity to warm those up in cold temperatures.  I live in the Midwest, so cold temps are anywhere from single digits to 32\u00b0F.  Once they are above freezing I don't use the remote start.\n\nAs far as the noise level itself, my truck has a quiet start option which is enabled, this keeps the engine at idle speed instead of revving loudly when the remote start is activated\n.\nWhen I looked for a replacement exhaust, I actively tried to avoid excessively loud ones, on a V6 they sound like crap and I didn't want to be obnoxiously loud.\n\nEdit:.

I don't know why, but as soon as I feel lazy and use the washer before the windshield has warmed up, it protests with the most annoying fog ever.\n- Crack a window open.\n- Keep out whatever brings moisture inside the car : coffee, smokes, kids, snow, wet mittens, etc.\n- If desperate, wear a mask. That's incredibly efficient to keep moisture in your breath from mating with your windshield.\n- If still foggy, do you really need a windshield?\n\nHope this helps :)", "I am aware that the engine needs the time to warm up.  And because of that, I never said word one to him about it.\n\nAt the same time, it is a residential neighborhood and doing that daily at 4a is just plain rude.", "Oorrr, get a pair of earbuds. \ud83e\udd37"]}
