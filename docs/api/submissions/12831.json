I installed the exhaust because the original needed replaced.  It is more durable and better made than the stock exhaust for about the same price.\n\nMy truck is not a diesel, it is a V6.  It is turbocharged, and from my understanding, it is helpful for longevity to warm those up in cold temperatures.  I live in the Midwest, so cold temps are anywhere from single digits to 32\u00b0F.  Once they are above freezing I don't use the remote start.\n\nAs far as the noise level itself, my truck has a quiet start option which is enabled, this keeps the engine at idle speed instead of revving loudly when the remote start is activated\n.\nWhen I looked for a replacement exhaust, I actively tried to avoid excessively loud ones, on a V6 they sound like crap and I didn't want to be obnoxiously loud.\n\n[This is what it sounds like](https://youtu.be/25ru4-5U3hI)", "created_utc": 1679401564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xfbuc/aita_for_starting_my_truck/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
