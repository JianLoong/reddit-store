My wife wanted her birthday to be extra special, cause she was turning 16, and had good grades. S wanted to go to an expensive restaurant with her family. I was not allowed to come according to her, but she wanted me to give her mom the money to pay for it. I told her I would not pay. She got upset and told me it was the least i could do and how she asks for so little.

That's life.\n\nShe has made it incredibly clear that you are not her family and that she wants nothing from you.\n\nWish granted. \n\nAnd '16' is an anniversary of being born, not an accomplishment. \n\nS needs to decide what kind of relationship she wants with you, but as long as she is not at least being cordial, she gets no extras.", "NTA. She may be only 16 but that's not too young to learn basic respect.\n\nShe can't treat you like dirt and expect you to bend over backwards and make her birthday special. Sounds like she's mad at the world and is taking out on you. Hope she grows up a bit and sees reason.", "NTA.\n\nThe audacity to ask you to pay but not come to her expensive birthday dinner is astounding.  \n\nI don't think you're  TAH for not getting her another gift. Why would you give her a physical gift anyway, knowing that she would likely just throw it away?", "NTA. Sounds like granddad could have paid. If he thinks she deserved the expensive dinner. But easier to blame you. She wouldn't be getting anything in the future. You give what you get.", "NTA.  Her granddad can pay for it.", "Nta she is a child, so don't take it personal, but if you can't go why the fuck would you pay", "NTA.  I'm sure there are some complicated reasons behind your stepdaughter's behavior, so I will grant her that.  Maybe some outside counseling would help; she is clearly angry and I suspect the root of that anger does not originate with you. That being said, her expecting to disrespect you and yet demand whatever she chooses from you is not okay.  That's not how the world works, not just in your family but anywhere.  You were right in standing your ground and I am glad to hear your wife supported your decision.  Her grandfather needs to butt out; his failure to support you and rather to support her selfish, unreasonable, and immature behavior helps nothing.  Sadly, it's always easier to blame a stepparent when something doesn't suit.  Basically, she decided how her 16th birthday would play out.  She did have a choice and she made it.", "NTA every time I hear about a situation in which a kid hates or dislikes the parent a line from breaking bad comes to mind. \u201cA man provides. And he does it even when he's not appreciated, or respected, or even loved. He simply bears up and he does it. Because he's a man.\u201d While I agree with the basic premise I also believe kids should learn respect and that there are consequences if the proper respect isn\u2019t given. Sure you may still buy her the essentials like food, clothes, shoes, etc. but disrespect like that can be punished by not providing her with an allowance, time to go out with friends, cell phone use in the house, etc. \n\nYour stepdaughter has with all due respect shitty behavior. She\u2019s 16 sure it\u2019s her birthday but that doesn\u2019t absolve her from being a spoiled brat. She requests money to have dinner at some expensive restaurant and refuses to have you at the dinner? What kind of logic is that. Sorry but your wife may be the asshole for letting it get to this point. Allowing her kid to disrespect you to this level is insane to me. The reason why I say the wife may be the asshole here is because there\u2019s plenty of AITA stories in which the parent of the stepkid will be defensive of whether the the stepparent gets to have a say in disciplining the kids. \n\nThe fact your wife doesn\u2019t seem to mind or make any comments on her daughters behavior is baffling to me. You need to have a talk with your wife and your daughter.", "Nta\n\nIf you're going to foot the bill for the expensive restaurant, you should be able to enjoy the meal. \n\nIf grandpa wanted his grandchild to eat at the expensive restaurant that OP wasn't invited to, he should have covered the cost. \n\nAt best, OP is responsible for basic necessities for the stepchild, anything more has to be reasonable.", "NTA.

No doubt this may be in part due to resentment at her family situation, which has to be tough.\n\nThat said, if S wants to have no relationship with you, and will openly disrespect you, not paying for a meal you weren't invited to is the logical consequence of that. I'm glad your wife is on your side, but it does make me wonder what more she could do as S's mom to curb this outrageous behavior.", "NTA - If she wont accept you as her step-dad, why on earth is she entitled to step-dad money.\n\nThat is just beyond rude. She has thrown out all the other money you spent on her, then asked you to pay for the privilege of excluding you from her life; and If her grandad was so worried about her 16th being ruined, then he could have paid for the more expensive restaurant.", "NTA.", "NTA If she doesn't consider you family, why should you pay for her birthday dinner? Plus she's not even allowing you to come.", "Are you the EH? Aw h&ll no! NOT the AH. If you\u2019re not good enough for little princess to make an effort to have a relationship with you, then your money, sure as heck does not need to be paying for her birthday dinner\u2026 or anything else for that matter!", "NTA and.. WTF?! The audacity! Glad your wife has your back because your SD sounds insufferable. But You and your wife have to sit down and find a solution because they aren\u2019t raising a good person and you are the one paying for this.", "Why would a child know who is paying for their birthday dinner? Why would she even feel comfortable saying who should or shouldn't last? For that, I say ESH because it sounds like boundaries are being crossed and not established across the board.", "NTA", "Soft YTA. The kid sounds like a bratty teenager but... she is. You, on the other hand, are trying to step into the role of parent. That means being the better person, and not expecting reciprocity, and acting like an adult. If you respond to pettiness with pettiness, you've failed.\n\nYou actually complain in your post, OP, that one way this stepdaughter expresses dislike is by refusing gifts. Well, here's a case where *she asked for a gift*. And then you refused?\n\nOP, pretend you're befriending a feral cat. For a long while, every time you offer a treat you'll get a scratch in return. But eventually, if you're consistently kind, the feral cat will adopt you.", "NTA, but it\u2019s a complicated situation. I recommend seeing a family therapist if you have the resources to do so. It sounds like your step-daughter has been through a lot, and she\u2019s unfairly lashing out as a result. It\u2019s going to take some time, but if you can manage it, be extra patient and kind to her because it seems like she is hurting. I\u2019m young and not yet a parent, so I\u2019m probably not qualified to give this advice \u2014 but I was also a real asshole to my parents as a young teen because I was emotionally unwell. Being awful and entitled was a way to affirm my own self-loathing and push people away when I was afraid they would hurt me (or that I would hurt them). No one owed me kindness in the face of my behavior, but the unwavering kindness I received eventually got through to me and helped me become a better person. Sounds like you care about your step daughter despite her actions, and that\u2019s a sign that your heart is in the right place. Let her know you\u2019ll be there for her when/if she needs you, but give her space until she\u2019s ready, unless the specific situation requires your intervention.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's just a classic 'slippery slope' argument, and they're classed as a fallacy.

Which I understand--it's an important metric, and can be usefully applied to a great many situations.\n\nBut one situation where I don't think equivalent exchange makes sense is a parent/child relationship.", "IMO the context is critical here. If you're talking about a kid in a stable family who's got a loving & trusting relationship with her parents--yes, absolutely, at that point you're teaching your kid courtesy and manners and care for others. \n\nIn this case, even though the kid is OBVIOUSLY being a brat, I think the context demands a different response. As a sidebar, one of the strange counter-intuitive things you can observe in children is that some kids in really unstable and dangerous homes will be very well behaved, but then once their home life stabilizes, they'll start acting out. And that's because they're not scared anymore; it's a good sign. \n\nThis is a teenager whose parents went through a divorce at a time when she would have been old enough to observe a lot and quite likely, she's got some trauma as a result. My personal feeling is, if the OP wants a relationship with her it'll be thankless for a while, but he's not going to get anywhere otherwise.", "For me it\u2019s the fact she is 16.

She is not entitled to an expensive dinner", "These are fair points, but they are not persuasive to me because:\n\n(1) OP did not cite the cost as a hardship. While he found the step-daughter's demands bratty and tasteless, he didn't say anything about how the expensive dinner would have been exceptional/a rare treat. If he'd said anything along those lines, I'd change my mind and agree that he shouldn't have paid.\n\n(2) OP did cite the daughter's rejection of gifts as a sore point. To me, it sounds like the daughter wants to know if gifts come with strings attached--i.e., potentially a hint of past trauma--& I wonder if giving her a bit of control in this one instance might make her more trusting/comfortable in the future.\n\nI really want to emphasize that I'm not saying the daughter is being kind or courteous or really anything but an awful brat. But a lot of people behave very badly when they're hurting and confused.", "NTA.  She has set the parameters of your relationship with her and decided that there isn't one.

A reasonable gift (a small card, a Starbucks coffee, like \\*small\\*) and a continuance of basic overtures (asking if she wants you at milestone events, for example) would be nice, but paying for a fancy restaurant you aren't invited to seems like it would do more harm than good as it would hurt you emotionally and teach her that it's okay to use people for money.", "NTA. she wanted you to pay but not come??? she sounds entitled. i know first hand how hard divorce is and creating new relationships with new step families but this is ridiculous.", "NTA.

She's growing up to keep any male figure at arms length not trusting them completely. You and your wife is assholes here this young girl needs therapy to help her with trusting.

So she hates you, disrespects you, won\u2019t accept reasonable discipline but still pay for my 16th birthday party that I don\u2019t want you at?

S is old enough to learn the lesson that you can disrespect people *or* you can expect them to cater to you, but you can't do both.\n\nThat being said, it's pretty normal for teens to be crappy to their parents as they're learning to assert their independence, and she's a teenager with obvious trauma around her father's role in her life. Stand your ground, but do it compassionately, and leave the door open for her to reconcile when she's more mature.", "Dude, she wanted you to not go, but to pay for it? She was trying specifically to make you look bad, it was a power move. That should have been shut down SO hard by your wife by not having ANYTHING at all.\n\nNTA.

You are not required to do anything for her. If you are the sole breadwinner in the household, then all you're required to do is make sure she has food, clothes and a roof over her head.

Reading this I distinctly got the impression that she\u2019s hurting in some form or fashion and this has never been validated or addressed. Especially with her bio father being a recovering *addict*. As for the many gifts and things of that nature, seeing as OP didn\u2019t refute the fact that S never actually asked, I\u2019m wondering if the gifts got morphed in S\u2019s head as OP trying to bribe or buy affections. Of course this probably is not the *intent*, but again, teenage brains are whacked out on insane hormone levels and throw in some spoonfuls of trauma from family issues and suddenly you have a perfect shitstorm for behavior like S is showing. \n\nNTA OP, but I\u2019d look into finding the root of all of this and questioning why exactly no one ever thought to try and get this child some counseling, and instead tried to cater to the bad behaviors", ">Why would a child know who is paying for their birthday dinner? \n\nShe\u2019s 16, not 6.
