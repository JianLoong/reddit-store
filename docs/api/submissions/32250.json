Maybe your friend was frustrated as well that they couldn\u2019t continue their \u201cpassion\u201d? Maybe she just wanted a listening ear? Her response to you makes me feel that she wasn\u2019t looking for advice in this case.\n\nMy two cents: call or text and apologize, say you are trying to look out for her well being, but then ask why she feels the way she does. Listen to her response. See why she said what she did. Regardless of how you feel about him, this is her relationship and she is allowed to run it how she feels, and the best thing you can do as a friend is offer support.", "Info: is the disappointment towards her or the situation?

But not the asshole", "He\u2019s the AT for wanting to have sex with her after six months? Crazy people on this sub", "How is the BF an a-hole for just expressing that he's disappointed that this happened to her and after 6 months can have sex because this is what they do when they meet. She wasn't there the whole time has he been mean to her has he been taking care of her he just voiced his respiration. And op went off on something that is completely not her business and not because she's protecting her friend but because she doesn't like the boyfriend this is her personal opinion this is her crap. Definitely in the wrong for yelling at the boyfriend because you have absolutely no idea what he's been doing for her since you are not around.", "NTA that dude is a fucking weirdo and hopefully your friend realizes that before it gets to the point where he\u2019s mad she wont have sex in a hospital bed right after giving birth lmao", "NAH. Your reaction is understandable, as is his. It\u2019s completely reasonable for him to be disappointed in the situation, which seems more likely than him being disappointed in your friend. You likely took it the wrong way and reacted rationally to the circumstances you perceived. You should try to be more empathetic rather than looking for reasons to justify your distaste for a man your friend likely loves.", "Unfortunately it\u2019s never our place to get mad for our friends. At the end of the day, they\u2019re in a relationship and they have to figure their own things out. \n\nYes, she came to you as a trusted friend that she could vent to. Yes, if the opportunity called for it, I think you\u2019re entitled to share your opinion. But no, you shouldn\u2019t be flipping out about it. \n\nSore topics like these should be treated with the most care and the most respect. At the end of the day, you\u2019re an outsider. THEY\u2019RE sleeping together tonight and now they will be in bed talking about YOU. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying to not feel mad for your friend, but expressing it by flipping out is never going to help the situation.\n\nUntil my opinion is ASKED for, I wouldn\u2019t give it in a situation like this. I\u2019m just here as a safe space for this person to get things off of their chest.\n\nI personally ask more questions than give opinions. \u201cOh he said that? So what do YOU think about it? .. How are YOU gonna handle that? Don\u2019t YOU think he\u2019s being unreasonable?\u201d\n\nSometimes the answers will surprise you, and you\u2019ll learn more about the person and how they think.

Is there some reason you've never trusted him? If they both think it's none of you're business, then it isn't. Yta.", "YTA when you\u2019re long distance you develop a really solid relationship based on communication but the majority of relationships need physical intimacy as well.  He has a right to be upset that his trip didn\u2019t go as he planned.  You don\u2019t have a right to butt in to their relationship like that.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just as upset that she can\u2019t have sex either and you screaming about her boyfriend being pissed about not having sex probably made her feel like shit or a slut.", "Exactly \"frustrated and disappointment\" doesn't necessarily mean that he blew a gasket and was screaming at her all sorts of abuse like half the people here are probably imagining, it could've also been a simple \"Ow that sucks I was looking forward to being intimate with you, well I hope you feel better soon\" but that's too normal of an interaction between human beings for this sub, so they go with the version where the dude is a complete monster that thinks of women as objects and is openly abusive towards them.", "Ok so, after some sleep I do realise that maybe I took this the wrong way and yes it could have just been a normal conversation so it's food for thought sure!   \n\n\nAs for the other red flags, it's things like her paying for his flights out of her paycheck for five years now, otherwise he won't fly out to her.   \n\n\nOr things like she is very big on putting pictures of her life on social media and him not wanting any mention of him on her social media because \"his parents won't approve of her\". Like Im not a big social media person either I prefer people not putting pictures of me online, and if he just said that, like it's a valid reason, but not even a mention like ooh BF is in town i'm so excited or the excuse my parents won't approve of you even after 5 years... like where do you tell them you go for an entire month?! You're going on 30 maybe it's time to have a conversation with mom and dad... But these are things I don't mention to her because I don't know what his home situation is like...  \n\n\nThe final thing that worries me is that he's been promising to move to our country for three years but postponed with the most ridiculous excuses always. And again I get not wanting to pack your stuff up and move intercontinental to a country you don't know anybody but your girlfriend that is a huge step and leap of trust I totally get that, but just the excuses just don't sit right with me?   \n\n\nIt all just gives me very 90 days to wed vibes if that makes sense? And we've been best friends for 20 years I know she's fragile when it comes to mental health issues and I worry about her. But like some of these posts said, maybe that's not up to me...", "I agree with this.. OP is the AH", "I disagree, even if he is disappointed in the situation, he should have keep his mouth shut, especially so soon after the surgery. The guy drill her so much that she had to have a cyste removed and he is still not satisfied, so it truly show  where his priority are since he doesn\u2019t have the decency to not express his disappointed while his GF is still recovering from surgery\u2026 NTA OP", "Ooof!! While it\u2019s possible that he could of actually been expressing normal and communicative disappointment about the fact they couldn\u2019t keep fucking when they\u2019d been expecting to\u2026 the red flags in this comment are BRIGHT RED. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this dude has a whole other life in his home country and is using your friend.", "God forbid a man be able to disclose his feelings to the person closest to him emotionally. OP and you are acting like he said \u201cReally wish I could\u2019ve fucked you more before your snatch broke\u201d.", "He might as well have. Fml, disclosing your feelings is one thing but have you never heard about showing compassion for those you love ? I think that takes priority in this situation. While she's hurting and healing he's whining about not being able to fuck her. Sure it's ok to be disappointed, but not what should be coming out of your mouth while your partner heals . Smh.", "Were you in the room with them? is it really that hard to believe that the friend might also be frustrated that their intimate time that comes around every 6 months was cut short, which would've prompted that interaction? nah can't be, women have no sexual desires, it's only guys that are horny and like sex!", "Now it's you that's reading into something that's not written. Of course both of them could be bummed about it, what in my comment makes you think otherwise? In my opinion tho, when someone is healing and physically hurting that shouldn't be something thats a priority let alone discussed with someone outside the relationship. Sure , they could have both pointed out \" ah man, we were having such fun\". \nIs the friend's reaction too much? I don't know, they're the ones who define their dynamics .\n But as a woman myself if my GROWN partner came to me and said that he was bummed about not having sex after we'd be doing it to the point of me having to go to the hospital, yea, I'd be a bit mad to say the least."]}
