There are 65.1 million in the US and 10 million in the UK. I\u2019m thinking maybe the idea that dogs are members of the family isn\u2019t as common of a concept?

A mature solution might very well be to end the relationship; she may not be what he\u2019s looking for, if he wants someone who is eager to move to Egypt to be with him, and he may not be what she\u2019s looking for, for the reasons outlined above.\n\nAt any rate, I stand by my assertion that it\u2019s far more troubling how brusquely he dismisses OP\u2019s feelings, while refusing to discuss any alternatives or compromises.

This, and the fact that I was constantly harassed and scammed in Egypt, and I am concerned you will be treated in the same regard when you walk around by yourself (which you would far more likely do as a resident vs as guest of your boyfriend).
