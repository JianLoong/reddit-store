So, my mom, dad, sister, her husband and my grandma were all at my parents house and my sister was talking about her pregnancy and what her daughter's name would be.\n\nShe said she's gonna name her \"Deborah\", my grandma loves the name and my parents like it too but I started laughing unfortunately. My sister immediately called me out and asked me what was funny, and I asked her if she was gonna really name her baby that. My grandma stepped in and said it's a pretty name and that it's better than \"modern kids names\". My mom was pissed off at me and made me apologize to my sister but I was so suprised at the name that I refused to apologize.\n\nNow my sister isn't talking to me right now, and I've tried reaching out to her multiple times, but nothing.
