So, my mom, dad, sister, her husband and my grandma were all at my parents house and my sister was talking about her pregnancy and what her daughter's name would be.\n\nShe said she's gonna name her \"Deborah\", my grandma loves the name and my parents like it too but I started laughing unfortunately. My sister immediately called me out and asked me what was funny, and I asked her if she was gonna really name her baby that. My grandma stepped in and said it's a pretty name and that it's better than \"modern kids names\". My mom was pissed off at me and made me apologize to my sister but I was so suprised at the name that I refused to apologize.\n\nNow my sister isn't talking to me right now, and I've tried reaching out to her multiple times, but nothing.

It\u2019s not ridiculous at all.", "Same Question then...why.", "Everything OP did here screams immaturity.\n\nLaughs at a normal name - shows OP is the kind of kid to bully others for having \"weird\" names. Don't I know them.\n\nRefuses to apologize. Doubles down on the childishness. \n\nOP has a lot of maturing to do, absolutely the asshole in this story.", "OR, those modern names will stick around and become normal and then someday be considered old fashioned themselves.", "That\u2019s my moms name too. Pronounced Deb-or-ahhh. It\u2019s beautiful.", "Not sure she might be thinking that she'll be teased because it's a generational name. Or might be breaking it down to where the middle part is bor \"bore, bored, boring.\" Or even \"Hey Deb!'or ugh!\" (Source I work around kids but even they aren't this mean) Either way, I had (pre-marriage) a perfectly normal name and I got teased. I got teased for being short. Kids will tease about anything whether given a reason or not. But, it's been my experience that it's adults who tend to come up with the horrible nicknames. That's what happened to me. My friends mom used to call me a weird name based off of my name. A kid did too and I thought he was picking on me until he explained the nickname. So I only let him call me it. As an adult I still remembered eight year old me hearing it and was using regularly for years.", "You\u2019re just as weird as the OP. Deborah is so fucking normal it\u2019s not worthy of comment at all.", "Yeah but there\u2019s a tactful way to go about it. Her sister wasn\u2019t just throwing out suggestions, she was telling everyone her final choice. I can\u2019t stand the name my sister chose for my niece who is now 3. It sounds like a strippers name. I just said \u201cAre you sure?\u201d When she really wanted my opinion I said \u201cit\u2019s not my favorite.\u201d At the end of the day, it was her and her husband\u2019s choice. I tactfully said my peace and moved on. Now, I don\u2019t say a word because it\u2019s her actual name.", "I thought at first it was going to be a ridiculous made up name that was accidentally laughed at. But Deborah? That's just a normal and properly spelled name. YTA.", "Yeah, I'm a bit disappointed as well. \nIt's not even Dhenbourah.", "I\u2019m young Gen X so I didn\u2019t go to school with a bunch of Debbies. The popularity was a little bit older than me. I imagine we will see more of names like Debbie, Cathy, Pattie, and such. A lot of people that are now in their 20s and having kids have grandparents with those names. There\u2019s always people that want to name their kids after a family member, such as a beloved grandparent. \n\nNaming trends are interesting. I\u2019ve know of several people that named their little girl Pearl. It\u2019s a pretty name, but the first time I thought of my great-grandmother\u2019s sister.", "> It\u2019s an absolute ridiculous name for this age\n\nHow and since when?", "Just like clothes, the \u201cin\u201d fashion goes in cycles.  We used to joke about the future when retirement homes would be full of Tiffany and Britneys, just because the old ladies at the time were Gertrude and Ethel.", "I\u2019ve encountered two siblings of primary school age named Percy and Ethel.", "I\u2019m just Seighing", "Damn, that hurt my eyes to read. LOL", "Don't forget Abcde.", "Same, Deborah is a normal name", "I think the point is is that Emma is indeed and old but popular name. It was one of the top names from 1880-1941 and then had a sharp decline until the 1990s where it has remained popular since then but still an older name.", "Adding: I have an extremely generational name. So did my parents but their names, especially my dad's is making a comeback."]}
