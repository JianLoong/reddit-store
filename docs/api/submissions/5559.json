{"id": 5559, "submission_id": "zujptb", "title": "AITA for not letting stranger use empty seat (that I paid for)?", "selftext": " \n\nYesterday afternoon, I (33F) went to a pantomime with my family at our local theatre. We have done this every year since I was a child. My sisters and I have all grown up and have our own kids; now they join us in our family tradition.\n\nWhen Mum died a few years ago, we continued to buy her a ticket\u2026 It was a way of remembering her (she started the whole thing, after all).\n\nThen last year, Dad said he didn\u2019t want to come any more. So at the panto yesterday: me, my daughter (13), my two sisters (35F & 30F), and their kids (8M, 10M, 11F, 6F). I had decided to continue with the extra seat. Our theatre is small and cramped and it\u2019s good to have a bit of extra room.\n\nThe extra seat is near the middle, between me and my younger sister, and we have put our coats on it.\n\nThere are two young men behind us, 18-20 at a guess (weird age to be at a panto but whatever). Just before the panto begins, one of them leans forward and asks if we\u2019d mind if he put his coat onto the spare chair. I said no. I paid for that seat.\n\nThe man didn\u2019t say anything, just nodded, but all through the first half of the show I could feel him staring at the back of my head. I heard him muttering to his friend and I\u2019m sure it was about me.\n\nDuring the interval, I tried to clear the air. I told him that the seat was important to me and that it was a memorial to my dead mother. He didn\u2019t seem to care about any of it. He just waved away my explanation and said it didn\u2019t matter. He and his friend went off during the interval for refreshments then came back right before the second half.\n\nI tried to speak to him again but he told me that the show was starting and he wanted to watch it. Then he folded up his jacket and lay it across his lap. He didn\u2019t look at me as he did it but I could tell he was trying to make a point. I was sick of his attituded and started to say something but someone else told me to be quiet, that I was being too loud.\n\nI was absolutely raging through the rest of the show, I couldn\u2019t concentrate and hardly had any clue what was going on. The whole thing completely ruined it for me. I know I shouldn\u2019t let myself get angry about someone else\u2019s insensitivity, but I felt provoked.\n\nAs soon as the curtain lowered and the final applause finished, I spun round to have it out with the man. But he was gone\u2014the two of them must have left a few minutes early to avoid the exit crowd. I got my stuff together, grabbed my daughter, and went to find them. My sister chased after me and told me to calm down.\n\nI bumped into a couple of people on the way out and snapped at them (here I was definitely TA) but there was no sign of the two men. I searched the local vicinity a bit and looked in a couple of bars/coffee shops that were close by but still couldn\u2019t find them.\n\nMy sister said I overreacted. She also said that she had no problem with the man putting his jacket on the empty seat (which is bizarre to me but she\u2019s always been a walkover like that).\n\nSo\u2026what\u2019s the verdict?", "created_utc": 1671918782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zujptb/aita_for_not_letting_stranger_use_empty_seat_that/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They did nothing to you. Nothing at all. It was all in your imagination. You\u2019ve created a whole situation to create more drama than the whole panto.\nETA: this must be fake.", "YTA. The seat was a memorial yet you used it a just extra empty space to hold coats. The guy asked and you said no. Fine\u2026but you couldn\u2019t just leave it at that. He accepted your response and didn\u2019t push any further. You made all that up in your head about him staring at you and talking about you. Then you disturbed other people with your attempt to talk further and bumping into them as you tried to accost him after the show. Get a grip and some therapy.", "YTA. It sounds like you have mental issues, honestly.  \n\nThe man thought it was a spare seat and innocently asked if he could put his coat there. You said no, he accepted your answer.\n\nThe rest of this \"altercation\" then happened entirely in your mind and imagination.  The fact that you were hunting this man down?! Very concerning.  He literally said nothing to you, did nothing to you that would warrant this. \n\nSeek therapy immediately.", "Man asks you to put his coat on empty seat.\n\nYou say no.\n\nHe says okay then.\n\nYou get apoplectic with rage for no reason and don't leave him alone for the whole night, ruin the show for yourself and everyone around you, and then try to hunt him down after the show to have it out with him.\n\nYou sound insane.\n\nYTA", "Is this for real? YTA for sure. I don\u2019t see anything these guys did wrong. Seems like you were sitting there overthinking the entire ordeal and angry for absolutely nothing. Why are you so bitter? They literally said or did nothing to you.", "YTA. You sound unhinged.", "It\u2019s bizarre to me that it\u2019s bizarre to you that someone wanted to put their jacket on the seat that was being used for jackets.\n\nIt would have been rude if he didn\u2019t ask, but he was polite about it, and didn\u2019t have a problem taking no for an answer. YTA for wanting to \u201chave it out with the man\u201d, there was definitely no need for that. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with him using the chair but I suppose it is your right to refuse the seat to him since you paid for it.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re also TA to yourself for sitting there stewing in your own anger for ages. Didn\u2019t affect him, but you could have had a much better night if you chilled out a bit.", "YTA.  Is this for real?\n\nThey asked, you said no, that should have been the end of it.  You not letting it drop, then chasing after them like a psycho make you TAH.", "YTA. You don't want them to put their coats on the chair while doing it yourself, you kept trying to talk to them throughout the show, and you went and looked for him after it? WTF?", "YTA. Why would you keep bugging him about it? You told him no and he complied. You created a situation out of it.", "If someone folding their jacket over their lap and supposedly staring at the back of your head is enough for you to \u201cabsolutely rage through the rest of the show\u201d, then that\u2019s on you, not him. YTA. Sounds like you may be projecting grief or other strong emotions about this tradition onto strangers.", "So a stranger saw you guys were throwing all your jackets on an empty seat. He asked could he put his jacket there. You said no. He agreed.\n\nEverything after this is you overreacting.\n\n>I could feel him staring at the back of my head. I heard him muttering to his friend and I\u2019m sure it was about me.\n\nThis is legit insane. If he was close enough to ask you to use the coat seat, then obviously he's going to be looking in your direction TO WATCH THE SHOW. \n\nAnd no he was not talking about you, but the show he was watching! \n\n>During the interval, I tried to clear the air. I told him that the seat was important to me and that it was a memorial to my dead mother.\n\nOkay. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but y'all were throwing coats on an empty seat. I really don't see how someone is objectively supposed to see that as a memorial. You didn't put a photo of her there. You didn't leave it empty for her spirit. You threw a bunch of clothes there. \n\nWhy are you acting like someone is supposed to know It was special? \n\n>Then he folded up his jacket and lay it across his lap. He didn\u2019t look at me as he did it but I could tell he was trying to make a point. \n\nWhat was he supposed to do with his jacket????? Throw it on the floor? Where else was he supposed to put it????? He put it in his lap! \n\n>I was absolutely raging through the rest of the show, I couldn\u2019t concentrate and hardly had any clue what was going on.\n\nWhy were you raging???? This man did nothing to you? And you became obsessed with him after one sentence? \n\n>grabbed my daughter, and went to find them\n\nMa'am, You have a child! A child! And you thought going to confront to strangers with your child in tow is a good idea? \n\nDo you always start confrontations in front of your child? This was supposed to be a good day and you're trying to start fights? I can only imagine what bullshit you pull in front of your kid everyday if just being asked about a coat sets you off like this. \n\n>My sister said I overreacted. She also said that she had no problem with the man putting his jacket on the empty seat (which is bizarre to me but she\u2019s always been a walkover like that).\n\nShe had no problem with it because everyone was tossing coats on the chair! It was the coat chair! \n\nAnd your sister sounds perfectly reasonable. \n\nAlso, this comment\n\n>There are two young men behind us, 18-20 at a guess (weird age to be at a panto but whatever).\n\nIs incredibly hilarious and hypocritical to me considering\n\n>I (33F) went to a pantomime with my family at our local theatre. We have done this every year since I was a child.\n\nYour daughter is 13. If you've been going every year since you were a child that means at the age of 18 and 19 you also were going to these. \n\nYTA and if you're not just a troll trying to rage bait over something that's incredibly insane, You need some serious help with your anger issues.", "YTA you took your daughter to angrily confront a stranger you pestered throughout the show. Yea, YTA", "YTA, not for telling him no when he asked, but for continuing to push the issue and think he was muttering to his friend about you, or giving you attitude, or doing things to call attention to the fact that he was upset. He was probably \"muttering\" to his friend about something involving the show. The fact that you wanted to say something to him after the show is horrifying to me and makes me think you should talk to a therapist about this experience.", "YTA. This is not a normal reaction. I\u2019d advise you do some major self reflection and wow if you\u2019re going to go confront strangers for no reason then leave your child out of it.", "YTA, so much of this is in your head.  You need anger management or something, this was such an overreaction", "Of course, YTA. You were fine when you told him that you didn't want to share your mom's seat. But then you wanted him to not only accept that decision, but accept the decision with joy. Newsflash\u2014he didn't have to understand or appreciate your reasoning. \n\nThis entire scenario reminds me of an episode of *Fraiser* where 9 of 10 members of a focus group say the radio show is great, and the tenth says \"I don't care for it.\" Rather than accept the great review, Frasier stalks the poor man for the entire episode. Just so with you. You won, you should have let it go.", "YTA. The guy said it was fine and you are the one pressing the issue and bothering someone after the question was dropped. Dont be so insecure.", "So let me get this straight you didn't want to allow him to put his jacket on your seat that you paid for, okay I think that's a little petty but I understand why. He is sitting behind you and now you feel him staring at the back of your head while he's sitting behind you. You are way out of line, and what do you mean it's weird for those two individuals to be there when you are an adult and are there as well, though I get it you are with your kids but who's to say those two didn't grow up with a similar tradition why is it weird for them to be there. YTA and there is literally nothing anybody can say that will change my mind on that", "YTA. Not for refusing to offer them the seat, but building it up in your head when they did nothing to provoke you.and literally trying to hunt them down. They probably left early because they were afraid of you. You also disturbed other random people. Not everything is about you. Get help", "Sorry, but YTA. The guy didn't insist and he did put his jacket elsewhere, so what's the deal? Even if he did so to make a point, it's not your problem anymore. You chose to get annoyed instead of focusing on the show. I get it, you're upset about his behavior, but you let your weird anger take over and didn't enjoy a show that's clearly a beloved family tradition. Try to calm down and forget about the encounter, it's not worth it.", "YTA\n\nThere was no situation here that warranted you reacting the way you did. You were literally running around looking for some sort of fight with them. You were in a state of rage. You behaved like this in front of your child, and others. You seriously need to get a grip.", "YTA. You literally made up this whole scenario in your head after he dropped it when you said no and completely overreacted. You whirled around to give him a piece of your mind and stormed out to find him? You might very well be going through something right now because of memories of your mother or something else but if this is common behavior, I strongly advise you to talk to a therapist about anger issues. This could easily get out of hand. What if you did find him? What would you have said or done? Honestly, if you were a family member I would be worried and urge you to talk to someone.", "YTA, and you probably need to speak to a therapist. I think you\u2019re struggling with paranoia or thoughts of persecution or something", "YTA and also insane apparently", "YTA. You are the only one who made this a big deal. You are the one insisting on him doing everything to spite you. You are the one he kept on badgering him. And the fucks up with you judging them going to see the show at their age? You sound insufferable and seem to make everything about you", "YTA. You said no. They let it go. They did not talk to you and most likely were not talking about you. Yet, you would not let up. Might I suggest therapy for your anger?", "YTA. What is wrong with you? Why were you so intent to create conflict?", "YTA, get over yourself", "Wow. That guy is living rent-free in your head without even trying. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and his \u201cattitude\u201d seems to be just your imagination. YTA.", "YTA, but not for refusing to let the guy put his coat on the empty seat, but for your total overeaction and massive assumptions made about the man afterwards.  Wow...just wow.", "They asked to use the seat. You said no. Then literally nothing else happened besides you becoming increasingly angry with them for no reason. They didn\u2019t even argue with you\u2026 you\u2019re the one who kept trying to talk to them about it. What did you want them to do differently? Go back in time and not ask in the first place? Also if a coat on the seat is disrespectful to your mom\u2026 why\u2019d you guys use her seat as the coat pile? YTA.", "You need therapy. Everything after his initial nod happened in your head, just read your story. You invented poor guy\u2019s thoughts and motivations, and you scared your sister and child while you were at it. So unnecessary. YTA", "YTA, and it sounds like you made this a MUCH bigger deal than he did. Most of what you\u2019re upset about seems to be assumed and not part of an actual interaction.", "My verdict is: YTA! He asked you said no, he complied, although not happily, but made no attempt to escalate. You did.  Have you ever considered anger management therapy?  Your actions were not normal.", "Dude... I get it, I do this too. I create entire scenarios in my head preparing for an epic showdown, but I've never tried to *act them out*. He asked if he could put his coat on the chair. You said no. That's the only real interaction you guys had. Everything else was hyped up in your head. YTA for trying to *confront* them. Like. It's not about the chair. It's about you and your inability to regulate your emotions.", "YTA he didn't ruin your night.  If anything you tried to ruin his night.  He asked a question and you said no.  He dropped it.  And frankly he probably didn't even care that much.  You went looking for him afterwards?  To what end so you could tell him off? Honestly you sound a bit unhinged.", " YTA-He asked you said no. It should have been over. Instead you built it up and kept going.", "YTA - He asked a question, you answered, he respected your answer and moved on. So, you then get self-obsessed and harass the poor guy, repeatedly for the duration of the show while disturbing others around you. Get over yourself. If for no other reason than to show the respect that you\u2019re trying to demand from a stranger.", "YTA - you don't know anything about his attitude,  and you are assuming a lot.\n\nHe didn't say anything, but you wanted to be snappy with him, to the point of plowing through other people to try to... what? Yell at them for not saying anything to you after your \"explanation\"?\n\nYour seat for your mom wasn't so special to keep your coats out of. You were TA from beginning to end here.", "YTA\n\nThis really sounds like someone made a simple request and was okay with being denied. You then felt guilty and drove yourself into a frenzy thinking that he was talking about you, when it's much more likely he stopped thinking about you after you said no. So you then decided you needed to pick a fight with him for some reason and got heated to the point of being nasty to other people. \n\nWTF is wrong with you?", "YTA. That is some classy Christmas spirit, my friend. Are you ok? Have you considered therapy? This lager lout behaviour is not healthy, wise or admirable.", "YTA. You're overthinking both the man's motives and his further actions. You don't KNOW that he was being petty about laying the coat on his lap or that his murmurs were about you. You don't know that he was staring at the back of your head. Most likely he dismissed you as soon as you said no and your persistence is way over the top", "YTA. Everything after his initial request was all in your head. He also didn't seem to want to continue talking about it - he was over it. And you searched inside bars and cafes for him? To confront him about what? What. did. the. man. actually. DO... that had you so angry?\n\nETA: Also, why the snarky remark about their age and saying it was weird that they were there? Maybe it is also a christmas tradition for them that holds special meaning? Maybe they just like theatre. YTA for that too.", "YTA he asked a question and you said no. No problem there. You continually trying to pick a fight with him and imagining that he was staring at you (he\u2019s behind you, he literally had to look past you) and then trying to fight him later? You made a scene and probably ruined the evening for everyone that you went with. The guy probably didn\u2019t know or care, but your family, they know, and you disturbed their evening by your unfounded rage.\n\nInstead of a nice evening your sister and daughter had to calm you down and try to keep you from fighting two innocent strangers.", "YTA- He asked, you answered. All the rest is made up in you own head. Get over it. He did nothing wrong by asking. You could feel him looking at you......  Seriously? Stop justifying your answer. Own it and be don't with it.", "YTA why did you choose to ruin your day with this nonsense? I feel sorry for your family having to endure your behavior.", "YTA. All he did was ask to hang his coat on the chair\u2026.which was filled with coats. That\u2019s not \u2018a memorial to your dead mother\u2019. Sounds like all this beef existed only in your head. Good thing you didn\u2019t see him afterward because you just would have made more of an ass of yourself.", "YTA. Literally nearly all that scenario was made up in your head.  He asked a question, you said no and he left it.  You then started imagining all sorts of things that just don't appear to have happened.", "I think you\u2019re grieving your mother through this tradition, which is a wonderful thing. But you full force hit a total stranger with your anger phase of grieving. I think it\u2019s time to see a therapist. YTA", "Woooooaaaaahhhhh..... really?\n\nThis extra seat is a memorial to your late mother...... that you all pile your coats up on? But allowing the coat of a polite stranger to rest there as well would somehow dishonor your mother?\n\nQuestion - would your mother feel her memory was being honored by your behavior that night? Would she be proud of you refusing to let someone set their coat down, and then when you refused and they politely took \"no\" for an answer, you react with such baseless rage that you try to hunt them down after the show with your children in tow?!\n\nYTA", "YTA. A few fries short of a Happy Meal.", "There\u2019s no way this is real. If it is, you have a major anger problem that you need help for. You supposedly got this worked up to the point that you were trying to find a couple of guys who politely asked if they could put their jackets on your empty seat and then accepted your \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nSeek help. \n\nYTA", "YTA and this comes off as unhinged. Most of this conflict took place in your own mind. He asked, you said no, he accepted that. You then took seriously innocuous things (intentionally putting his coat in his lap???) and stewed. I\u2019m saying this with kindness- get help. No one ruined the show for you but you.", "YTA. You told them no. That was the end of it. All of the rest you created as a fiction. What in the world would you have said if you did find them? \u201cI could FEEL you staring at the back of my head!\u201d? \n\nIf you had acted out the anger and it was caught on tape, you would have rightfully been judged as having a mental break. You need to talk to your therapist about your paranoia.", "YTA for building all this up in your head. Seems a bit unhinged. Seek therapy", "YTA. Get help", "Yta. I'm sure he didn't actually care that much about not being able to put his jacket on your mom's seat. It seems like he dropped it and moved on trying to enjoy his evening, and you decided to take out your grief for your deceased mother in a form of anger aimed towards a complete stranger. I am very sorry for your loss, but the way you acted at the theater was entirely inappropriate and likely ruined the night for both you, your family, and the two young men.", "Were you mad they didnt argue and just accepted your \"no\"? Sure sounds like it...", "YTA. What is it that compelled you to keep at it over and over? Have it out with the man? You think your sister is a walkover, you judge the ages of people who go to a show and you hyped yourself up for a fight over a non issue with a stranger. My mother passed away not long ago and if i had behaved the way you did she would have been ashamed of me. What do you think your mother would have thought of your behaviour?", "YTA. You tried to hunt a guy down for a confrontation with your kids there. Over a coat on an empty chair. What the actual eff is wrong with you? Get evaluated.", "YTA for everything you did or imagined after refusing the seat.", "YTA. This is all in your head and you couldn\u2019t let it go because you knew you were in the wrong. That\u2019s why you tried repeatedly to address the issue with the man. And now he is living rent-free in your head. Good luck enjoying the pantomime in the future.", "YTA, seek therapy immediately", "YTA, a huge one.\n\nHe wasn't provoking, he asked, you said no, he accepted it, he didn't say ANYTHING else to you and made the rest of it up in your head. \nFrankly your behavior is unhinged, you couldn't enjoy the show because you THOUGHT that MAYBE this man was criticizing you? \n\nYou need help, leave people alone.", "YTA; you seem to have a problem with boundaries", "YTA and pretty self centered.\nChances are, he was a little annoyed and stopped thinking about it after two minutes. The only conflict was in your head.\n(Also, idk about your mother's character, but personally, if someone wanted to have a memorial for me at a place that was important to me? Making sure people are comfortable there would be a pretty good way to do it. And a lot more meaningful than an empty seat. \ud83e\udd37)", "YTA. Why do you assume everything that guy did was directed as you? You are not the main character in everyone else\u2019s life. It\u2019s honestly a bit unhinged to think that someone *checks notes* removing their jacket while indoors is a passive aggressive insult toward you. And then to stew in anger and try to chase them down?? I get that grief can impact people in strange ways but please spend some time learning to regulate your emotions.", "Wait, you could feel him staring at you and yet you didn't notice he was gone? Was your spider sense off at that point?\n\nIf this is remotely true, of course YTA. Who goes chasing after a stranger at bars? Seek help, this is completely abnormal behaviour.", "YTA and you DESPERATELY need therapy cause it\u2019s clear you have some sort of mental illness since you just had an entire fight in your head. (Not everything\u2019s about you nor do most people care enough to put in the effort to argue with you)", "YTA, not because you wanted to honor your mother, but because you got all out of control, confrontational, and angry, and over what?  A guy asking to put his coat on your empty seat, then getting angry because he refused to engage with an angry person who wouldn\u2019t drop it.  Btw, where was he supposed to put his jacket?  Would your mom have been happy with your actions?  \n\nI", "YTA. It sounds like he let it go. Maybe he wasn\u2019t thrilled, but he didn\u2019t try to start with you. But you, for whatever unknown reason, could not let it go. You kept going\u2026 and going\u2026 and then going some more. Until by the end you were hunting this man\u2014 who hadn\u2019t tried to speak to you since his initial question\u2014 down like a literal crazy person. This must be about something else, perhaps trauma from missing your mom? Idk, but you were way way over the line here.", "YTA. The man accepted your answer and you riled this whole thing up in your mind. And then took it out on other people. You wanted him to react a certain way and kept pestering him to try and get it. It\u2019s unhinged.", "Unfortunately YTA.\nI don't believe this is fake due to the fact that projecting your emotions onto others is real. Doesnt justify the behavior but it is a thing. \n\nIn the future it might help to list out facts and remove all feelings and your assumptions. Fact: the man asked a question and you said no. Fact: he was short in his responses. \n\nIt is not his job to make you feel better. Maybe something is going on in his life that is tragic and he doesn't want to engage in a bunch of small talk. \n\nJust like he doesn't know what you're going through, you don't know what others are going through.", "YTA - why make such a big deal over it??? You're reaction to a simple innocent question was so overdramatic. They asked, you said no, they accepted and moved on with their life. Why do you feel like you had continually turn around to confront them???", "YTA, but not for your decision about the seat. \n\nYTA for assuming he was mad. Newsflash: you were a blip on his radar. An annoying one. So annoying that OTHER PEOPLE told you to be quiet and your own sister told you you overreacted. She\u2019s right. Stop projecting.", "Holy overreaction, Batman!   You weren't feeling him looking at the back of your head. That was all you. He was watching the show. Then instead of just letting the matter drop, you tried to harass him further about it, and even tried to chase him down. It wasn't wrong of him to ask if he could put his coat on the seat. But you said no, and it sounds like he accepted that.  YTA, definitely, absolutely. Maybe it's time to quit watching Real Housewives and realize that there doesn't have to be drama in ever interaction with other people.", "YTA. Get over yourself.", "I deadass have nothing to say.", "YTA.\n\n\nYou created this conflict in your own head.  \n\n\nYou got yourself worked up without any actual provocation to the point that you were disturbing other paying attendees.\n\n\nYou then went WELL out of your way to try to start a ruckus with the two young dudes that you created your own conflict around.\n\n\nI get that grief makes people do some interesting things but you were guilty of sustained and aggravated assholery there.\n\n\nPlease get a grip before you get yourself into trouble.", "What is wrong with you? Absolutely everything you're worked up about is happening in your head. And who is 18-20 a weird age to be at a panto? That's a ridiculous thing to think. \n\nYTA and ruined your evening all on your own.", "Oh wow YTA. From your description the guy did literally nothing and you invented reasons to get angry in your head. You think he had an attitude problem when in fact you do.", "YTA.  Say this out loud - \"Everything is not about me.  The world doesn't revolve around me.\"  Repeat as many times as necessary.  \n\nThat guy didn't do anything.  You said no, he accepted that and moved on with his night.  Your conscience ruined your night, not that guy.", "I get your loss and I'm so sorry for that but it seems like you overreacted.

We have done this every year since I was a child. My sisters and I have all grown up and have our own kids; now they join us in our family tradition.\n\nWhen Mum died a few years ago, we continued to buy her a ticket\u2026 It was a way of remembering her (she started the whole thing, after all).\n\nThen last year, Dad said he didn\u2019t want to come any more. So at the panto yesterday: me, my daughter (13), my two sisters (35F & 30F), and their kids (8M, 10M, 11F, 6F). I had decided to continue with the extra seat. Our theatre is small and cramped and it\u2019s good to have a bit of extra room.\n\nThe extra seat is near the middle, between me and my younger sister, and we have put our coats on it.\n\nThere are two young men behind us, 18-20 at a guess (weird age to be at a panto but whatever). Just before the panto begins, one of them leans forward and asks if we\u2019d mind if he put his coat onto the spare chair. I said no. I paid for that seat.\n\nThe man didn\u2019t say anything, just nodded, but all through the first half of the show I could feel him staring at the back of my head. I heard him muttering to his friend and I\u2019m sure it was about me.\n\nDuring the interval, I tried to clear the air. I told him that the seat was important to me and that it was a memorial to my dead mother. He didn\u2019t seem to care about any of it. He just waved away my explanation and said it didn\u2019t matter. He and his friend went off during the interval for refreshments then came back right before the second half.\n\nI tried to speak to him again but he told me that the show was starting and he wanted to watch it. Then he folded up his jacket and lay it across his lap. He didn\u2019t look at me as he did it but I could tell he was trying to make a point. I was sick of his attituded and started to say something but someone else told me to be quiet, that I was being too loud.\n\nI was absolutely raging through the rest of the show, I couldn\u2019t concentrate and hardly had any clue what was going on. The whole thing completely ruined it for me. I know I shouldn\u2019t let myself get angry about someone else\u2019s insensitivity, but I felt provoked.\n\nAs soon as the curtain lowered and the final applause finished, I spun round to have it out with the man. But he was gone\u2014the two of them must have left a few minutes early to avoid the exit crowd. I got my stuff together, grabbed my daughter, and went to find them. My sister chased after me and told me to calm down.\n\nI bumped into a couple of people on the way out and snapped at them (here I was definitely TA) but there was no sign of the two men. I searched the local vicinity a bit and looked in a couple of bars/coffee shops that were close by but still couldn\u2019t find them.\n\nMy sister said I overreacted. She also said that she had no problem with the man putting his jacket on the empty seat (which is bizarre to me but she\u2019s always been a walkover like that).\n\nSo\u2026what\u2019s the verdict?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA for not letting him use the seat but weird how you let what you assumed what his attitude ruin your experience.

It sounds like you assumed what this guy said or was doing (\u201cI could feel him staring at the back of my head\u201d - is that really a justification for your reaction at the end?!), and he just didn\u2019t want it to escalate any further but you clearly had an unnecessary point to make.

You prob don't know what it is, but you need therapy to figure it out and resolve it.", "YTA-not for the seat though, you bought it for the viewing, you decide if someone puts it there, you said no after he asked and it should've just ended there so everyone could've enjoyed the movie, you let overthinking and your own issues create in your head what happened after, that made you want to actually hunt them down, only people with mental issues willingly try to hunt people down because they're accusing them of having an attitude. Either get some therapy, medication or control yourself, you could've just ignored them and continued watching the show, they didn't make any trouble, you started issues by acting like everything they did was about you.", "It's a memorial to your deceased mother so you throw your coats there? YTA.", "[deleted]", "Has to be fake. If it\u2019s real she\u2019s thisclose to getting a mental health hold. Imagine stalking a guy into other public spaces because you think he was looking at the back of your head.", "Crazy, right?  I mean, supposedly a memorial to mom, but really just good to have some extra room and a place to put their coats.  Makes no sense to me - nor does the OP's actions during and after the show.  Also, based on ages, there was a time when one or more of the sisters was there as an 18-20 year old with no kids yet on the horizon - but for the young men to be there at 18-20 is a weird thing.  It's almost  like she was looking to find something to be offended about before the show even started.\n\nYTA for the record, OP.", "And snapping at innocent people, being loud and ruining the panto for others. All very concerning things considering how innocent the question the man asked was.", "Yeah the hunting portion is definitely worrisome. OP needs serious help", "Exactly!", "Also the irony of your username \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "To add on actually, I feel sorry for your sister. I\u2019ve got family members who are angry about stupid things like this all the time and cause scenes in public.\n\nI\u2019ve had to tell them to calm down too and it\u2019s really embarrassing.", "All of this. \n\nOP, if this mild interaction sends you into such a rage that you can't concentrate and try to stalk--yes, *stalk*-- the men afterwards to confront them? You need professional help. \n\nThe strangers at the panto who were shushing you and your own sister should have given you enough of a clue before you reached out to the internet, but. Get. Help. This is not normal.", "Not to mention the fact she asked randos if she\u2019d seen them just to pick a fight", "The \u201cfeeling\u201d of him looking at her is him WATCHING the damn show! He was sitting behind them, of course he\u2019s going to be looking where the show is! OP is an AH and definitely unhinged. Who tf tries to \u201cclear the air\u201d and then tries to HUNT THE PERSON DOWN OUT OF ANGER? Crazy.", "Scary, stuff like this. Imagine asking someone a question and for the rest of the night they're villainising you in their head to the point they start searching local pubs to find you and confront you.", "The poor man must have been so confused", "Dido.", "YTA for making a big deal about it. You even tried to find them after the show to have it out with them.", "OP seems completely deranged. \n\n\u2018He put his coat across his lap to make a point\u2019\nWhere else was he gonna put that coat? Up your arse?\n\nYTA OP", "What on earth did the guy do to make him the AH?", "Think your verdict is wrong there Chief.", "what did the guy possibly to do make him an AH? he asked if he could put his coat down, and accepted OP's answer.", "She ruined her own outing. And she probably embarrassed her family as well.", "What specific actions did they do to make you think they were punks or entitled?", "OP?", "What exactly did he do to ruin her evening? Nothing. He did nothing. She ruined her own evening.  Emotional growth - she needs it.", "There is no entitlement on the young man's side. He asked. She said no, he let it go.\nShe kept it going in her own head.\n\nThere was zero reason for her to approach him and explain why she said no.\n\nShe is absolutely YTA in this situation.", "Seriously. I have paranoid schizophrenia and work in peer support with others with it and this honestly reads a lot like paranoid persecution complex thought processes. Not obviously diagnosing her online but just saying, her behaviour is literally resembling of psychosis in terms of interpreting normal behaviour to be such an insult that running to confront them seemed appropriate to her. So I hope this is just someone\u2019s fake ragebait.", "I\u2019ve had moments like this myself, and grew up with a parent who was like this pretty constantly to some degree. She got us kicked out of every place in town (Pizza Hut, the VHS rental place, grocery store, library\u2026). Always thinking people were talking about/staring at her.", "Other possibility is that OP was drunk as hell.", "I think the two guys left early specifically to avoid her. I'm guessing she was being even more disruptive than she's letting on and they could tell the type of person they had on their hands. Good call on their part.", "Seriously it\u2019s terrifying. I have a sister with mental health problems that does the same kind of stuff. It\u2019s even crazier that she took her daughter to go find them. This person is in serious need of mental health care.", "[deleted]", "You\u2019re right, the muttering she\u2019s convinced is about her sounds familiar.", "I\u2019m sorry about that. Must have been super hard growing up with a parent like that and the uncertainty that you\u2019d have to leave places at a moment\u2019s notice.", "But we have no actual idea if he did that. Could have been talking about the show.\n\nAnd any time past that when he's waving her off, it would be because he doesn't care about this strangers tradition of saving a seat", "Neither of these paragraphs are indicative of \"young punks\". It sounds more like OP's paranoia.", "He would have absolutely looked at her when he was folding his jacket, he would have made sure she heard something, he would have laughed at her, done something concrete to intimidate her. She never actually saw him look at her. Never heard anything, he didn\u2019t glare, literally did nothing to her. \n\nThe people she was with thought she was overacting and there is nothing in this post about his actions that should make anyone assume this was anything but her imagination.", "Yes how dare they \\*checks notes\\* attend and enjoy a show.\n\nOP has no proof they were talking about her or staring at her. The man accepted the answer and held onto his coat (like really what was he supposed to do, throw it on the ground?), and OP created a scenario in her head where she's the victim of some bizarre event. At most, *maybe* they agreed it was weird that she bought a chair for someone who wasn't there. They probably left and haven't thought about this since (or if they did, it was to tell their friends about the weird person at the pantomime show)", "Thanks. Yeah. I\u2019m actually having a horrid day just feeling off kilter because of the holiday. I\u2019ve got that co-dependency and abandonment issues thing going. \n\nI really, really want the OP to get therapy."]}
