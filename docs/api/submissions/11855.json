In recent times she hasn\u2019t had nearly as many as she did when I was little. Though I am always cautious with things I show her in case of flashing lights. I am well aware of her disability and how awful it is for her.\n\nMy mom has begun bringing her dog, Ruby, *everywhere*, out in stores and to restaurants. All the while with her in a little bag on my mom's shoulder. She claims Ruby is a service dog that will alert her if she is about to have a seizure.\n\nRuby was never trained in any way, and even then, she couldn\u2019t properly alert if she\u2019s in the bag. If she was on a leash with a harness or anything similar this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  They have printed off patches to put on Ruby\u2019s bag so that \u201cno one can ask us about her\u201d because they say \u2018Medical alert\u2019 on them.\n\nMy main problem showed up even more recently, while we were at a restaurant with family, they requested an extra chair just for her to sit on so they could put her bowl on the table and feed her with food from their plates. (Even getting an extra glass of ice water for her) That is the most embarrassing thing to have to deal with because if they want her to be a service dog she should act like one. I\u2019m not saying service dogs can\u2019t be loved, cared for, and pampered, far from it, they deserve that. But while you are out in public they should be *working*.\n\nThey have done this every single time they have gone out to eat since then, not only that but they will constantly coo to her and pet her and feed her throughout the entire dinner. I have held my tongue because I don\u2019t want to get into an argument that I know I can\u2019t win. I tried to tell her how I found it ridiculous once and she said \u201cIt\u2019s because you can\u2019t see my disability isn\u2019t it?\u201d as if I hadn\u2019t seen her have seizures and known how dangerous they are, my whole life.\n\nMy birthday is a few weeks away and every year we go out to eat. Last year I asked her to not bring her and she was upset at me but didn\u2019t bring her. This year I tried to ask her the same thing and she told me I was being ridiculous and dropped the conversation.\n\nI just want one dinner, one night in the year where I don\u2019t have to see the dog eating at the table, off of their silverware and them cooing and kissing her during dinner with food around. Not to mention, this is the first time that I\u2019m inviting a friend to this dinner. This particular friend is slightly allergic to dogs.

For epilepsy untrained dogs are still able to tell the warning signs of a seizure before the person. I have a friend with epilepsy who only had small seizures, but the first time she had a grand mal, we were at a friend's house with dogs (beautiful full grown Rottweilers)that were in no way trained as a service animal. When my friend tried to get up from the couch saying she was feeling well, the dogs came from another room and laid on her to prevent her from getting up ( the dogs would not move even when called yes they had regular training) less  than 30 seconds later she had the seizure. If she had been able to get up, she would have been seriously hurt. This has happened a few times with different untrained dogs. She got herself a small dog now that will start barking and gets clingy when she is about to have a seizure. So, even in a carrier, the dog can still alert your mom. \n\nThis is a no-win situation.

Everywhere I\u2019ve worked policy was to just assume all dogs were service dogs (even if it was clear as day they weren\u2019t) OP, NTA. Exmil did this with her dog. Chair, own fork, the whole 9. Thankfully\u2026 only in private. I do understand though. However just not going out to eat will likely be the better option since I doubt they\u2019ll back from this\u2026.till confronted by a manager who knows his laws \ud83d\ude05", "No regulations say that dogs are allowed to eat off the table. I'm pretty sure in most places it says the opposite.", "That and I think how the ADA works on service dogs is a mess in the first place.  \n\nYes, there should be certification tests that the dog can perform the task it's required to do, then a valid ID for the animal being made.  That part should be gov't funded.", "I have read the ADA and there is nothing in there about if a handler lets them eat from the table. Nothing at all. This topic is not even addressed.  All it says is:\n\nDirect copy & paste: A service animal must be under the control of its handler. Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless the individual\u2019s disability prevents using these devices or these devices interfere with the service animal\u2019s safe, effective performance of tasks. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.\n\nWhen it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: \n\n(1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and\n\n(2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. \n\nStaff cannot ask about the person\u2019s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.\n\nAllergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.\n\n\r  \nA person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal\u2019s presence.\n\n\r  \nEstablishments that sell or prepare food must generally allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.\r  \nPeople with disabilities who use service animals cannot be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably than other patrons, or charged fees that are not charged to other patrons without animals. In addition, if a business requires a deposit or fee to be paid by patrons with pets, it must waive the charge for service animals.\n\n\r  \nIf a business such as a hotel normally charges guests for damage that they cause, a customer with a disability may also be charged for damage caused by himself or his service animal.\n\n\r  \nStaff are not required to provide care for or supervision of a service animal.\n\nWe have liars who come into my place of employment with mutts who are DEFINITELY not service dogs and claim they are and there's not a thing we can do about it until they poop or pee, so long as the mutt is on a leash.", "Or the stabbing will be with an epi-pen while the grandma was going into anaphylaxis", "I've always thought it would be fun to have an AITA subreddit where you only get to vote by title alone, and THEN you get to see the original post and details after lol.", "I don't think the person you were responding to disagrees with you.", "I'm saying they shouldn't but for whatever reason OP's mom's dog is allowed to. No dog should eat at the table", "...yes...that's what I'm saying. Business owners could literally read the ADA section on service dogs and be like \"oh no they can't eat off the table, there is no grounds for a suit here\" and toss them out but instead of doing that and arguing with a customer over it, they permit the bad behavior. \n\nIt's the same reason my grocery store doesn't kick people out who have their tiny dogs sitting in the cart basket and claiming they are service dogs."]}
