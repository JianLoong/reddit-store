In recent times she hasn\u2019t had nearly as many as she did when I was little. Though I am always cautious with things I show her in case of flashing lights. I am well aware of her disability and how awful it is for her.\n\nMy mom has begun bringing her dog, Ruby, *everywhere*, out in stores and to restaurants. All the while with her in a little bag on my mom's shoulder. She claims Ruby is a service dog that will alert her if she is about to have a seizure.\n\nRuby was never trained in any way, and even then, she couldn\u2019t properly alert if she\u2019s in the bag. If she was on a leash with a harness or anything similar this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  They have printed off patches to put on Ruby\u2019s bag so that \u201cno one can ask us about her\u201d because they say \u2018Medical alert\u2019 on them.\n\nMy main problem showed up even more recently, while we were at a restaurant with family, they requested an extra chair just for her to sit on so they could put her bowl on the table and feed her with food from their plates. (Even getting an extra glass of ice water for her) That is the most embarrassing thing to have to deal with because if they want her to be a service dog she should act like one. I\u2019m not saying service dogs can\u2019t be loved, cared for, and pampered, far from it, they deserve that. But while you are out in public they should be *working*.\n\nThey have done this every single time they have gone out to eat since then, not only that but they will constantly coo to her and pet her and feed her throughout the entire dinner. I have held my tongue because I don\u2019t want to get into an argument that I know I can\u2019t win. I tried to tell her how I found it ridiculous once and she said \u201cIt\u2019s because you can\u2019t see my disability isn\u2019t it?\u201d as if I hadn\u2019t seen her have seizures and known how dangerous they are, my whole life.\n\nMy birthday is a few weeks away and every year we go out to eat. Last year I asked her to not bring her and she was upset at me but didn\u2019t bring her. This year I tried to ask her the same thing and she told me I was being ridiculous and dropped the conversation.\n\nI just want one dinner, one night in the year where I don\u2019t have to see the dog eating at the table, off of their silverware and them cooing and kissing her during dinner with food around. Not to mention, this is the first time that I\u2019m inviting a friend to this dinner. This particular friend is slightly allergic to dogs.

For epilepsy untrained dogs are still able to tell the warning signs of a seizure before the person. I have a friend with epilepsy who only had small seizures, but the first time she had a grand mal, we were at a friend's house with dogs (beautiful full grown Rottweilers)that were in no way trained as a service animal. When my friend tried to get up from the couch saying she was feeling well, the dogs came from another room and laid on her to prevent her from getting up ( the dogs would not move even when called yes they had regular training) less  than 30 seconds later she had the seizure. If she had been able to get up, she would have been seriously hurt. This has happened a few times with different untrained dogs. She got herself a small dog now that will start barking and gets clingy when she is about to have a seizure. So, even in a carrier, the dog can still alert your mom. \n\nThis is a no-win situation.

A service dog has been thoroughly trained to perform a specific task--Ruby has not.

That's the part I'm hung up on.", "NTA\n\nThis is just so overtop it seriously baffles me", "NTA I hate people who just decide their animal is a service dog or an ESA with 0 formal training and then they think that gives them a free pass.

That dog has likely never \"alerted\" on a coming seizure, and may have once coincidentally done something your mom identified as helpful. NTA. \n\nIf pushed, compromise.

You should be able to have the kind of birthday you want.  So you can ask your mother to leave the dog home as your one and only birthday present from her.

Either she comes without the dog or she doesn\u2019t come at all. I would also speak to the restaurant in advance - depending on whether you want the dog there but on the floor or not there at all (because let\u2019s face it - your mom will find some way to bring that dog up to where the humans are sitting) - they may have a solution.

But making places bend backwards to accommodate dogs and being generally unreasonable in public incites business owners to push back against service dogs in general. People that do stuff like this are the reason you\u2019re given the side eye when you enter with a service dog, why people question you about your dog endlessly, argue with you or flat out refuse to have your dog enter.

I wouldn't invite her at all tbh, what she's doing is disrespectful to the restaurant, to you, and to anyone that has a real service dog.\n\nEdited to add: the alternative for you is to TELL the restaurant she is lying about it being a service dog and let them handle it.
