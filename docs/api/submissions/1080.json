Plenty of people get kicked out of colleges for behaviour like this.", "ESH\n\nYou should just have confronted him yourself. Using tattling as maybe a last resort if he really wouldn't stop. You tattleed without even discussing your concerns with him?\n\nHe just shouldn't be trolling\n\nYour immature way of dealing with the situation probably caused permanent damage to your relationship with your cousin. I hope for you that he isn't petty or IT savvy enough to screw you over.", "NTA. He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t contact the authorities.", "NTA.  Ian could get into big trouble with the college which must have anti-harrassment policies. \n\nIf he's doing this stuff from his dorm room, it wouldn't be all that difficult for IT to track him down in response to student complaints about his antics.", "NTA, Ian is a bully and you only got to see a little bit of it. Who knows his extent if he thinks harassing and bullying is funny. You did the right thing but honestly you should also report it to your college. Who knows how the people on the receiving end are dealing with it you know? Severe level of immaturity on his part. You\u2019ve done great by distancing yourself.", "Any adult who tattles to another adult\u2019s literal mommy is pretty much going to be the asshole by default lol.

Fuck, you are supposed to be in college haha.", "NTA. Your cousin is a bully and a coward. His behaviour is disgusting and needs calling out", "dude YTA.  you made him tell you about it, then you laughed at some of the comments i\u2019m sure. you said nothing  and split. then you  \u201cthought about it\u201d, after which you called his mommy and tattletaled on him \n\nwhy didn\u2019t you just call and talk to him!?!  it\u2019s not like he was damaging property or hurting anyone or stalking people.  he just sounds like a lonely misfit kid in a new place with probably no friends\n\nand the one person he knows and feels comfortable with, freakin forces him to fess up and then TELLS his MOTHER on him.  lame dude\n\nhe maybe a nerd - but you\u2019re a snitch.  at least a nerd can fix your computer \u2026\u2026  well maybe not yours anymore", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ian and I spent a lot time together growing up but kind of drifted apart a bit in recent years. Ian is a huge computer nerd and is our family technology guy.\n\nIn recent months, I've been bumping into Ian a lot more as we're now coincidentally attending the same college and living in dorms (not in the same dorm though).\n\nA few days ago, I was hanging out in Ian's dorm and I asked to borrow his computer so I could check on something for my class (I could've used my phone but the mobile version of the website is garbage).

Also: 18 is not an adult I don\u2019t care what the law says, I don\u2019t trust 18 year olds to make sound decisions, contacting a parent was smart. \nBetter than contacting the school, the school could\u2019ve gotten him kicked out", "He should report him still. Who knows how those people have been affected by it. Clearly Ian has no accountability given he thought it\u2019s just fun. Silence is complacency and this kid probably won\u2019t stop.", "Act like a kid, get treated like a kid", "Would it have been better to report him to the school?", "Yeah I'm sure the bully would definitely stop because his cousin politely asked him to. Dude, seriously? From the post it sounds like this guy feels no remorse and sees nothing wrong with his actions, which could've caused a lot of distress to the people they affected. Ian ain't the victim.", "I don't think OP \"laughed at some of the comments\". He acknowledged that some were comically ridiculous, but that doesn't mean he necessarily laughed at them. OP's cousin definitely needed to be stopped before anything severe happened. If anything, he was doing his cousin a favour by not going to the school about this instead of just his aunt.", "Yeah, judging by the post he sees nothing wrong with his actions. I wonder if this isn't the first time he's been bullying people.", "Oh yeah, because adults never say anything mean to other people anonymously online lol", "It would have been better to have a conversation about it with his cousin, or hell, even just ignore it and mind his own business.", "this person really said \u201chow dare you stop someone from harassing people for no reason\u201d like what", "apparently Reddit is where empathy goes to die!\nthese are kids- 18 year old boys do not have fully formed brains yet\n\nthis kid is lonely and insecure and is probably in his room all the time. what he\u2019s basically doing is sitting on the sidelines muttering rude comments about the cool kids as they walk by.  he doesn\u2019t even have a friend to do it with, so he does it online\n\nhe\u2019s not threatening anyone.  his cousin even said it was funny.  is it a good idea - NO.  should he be encouraged to stop it - absolutely.  \n\nand his cousin should\u2019ve had that talk with him. if he didn\u2019t stop or it escalated- then he should\u2019ve involved other people", "Multiple profiles? Probably not. Seems like it\u2019s all he does. Picture him in his little dorm just spewing hate because he can\u2019t go out and socialize. Kids probably dark\u2026 (in his mind not skin color)", "Doesn't make it any less childish to do it. Actions have consequences.\n\nThen again, there's a lot of children with more sense than OP's cousin.", "This feels like a teenager's response.", "Oh the horror, basically 1984", "yes. that was my exact answer!!  you got me. \n\ndoes that answer even make sense to you. it lacks logic or any comprehension of the human psyche \n\nthe fact that your mind even works like that, makes me worry for you \u2026\u2026 \n\nput the phone down and go get some fresh air. i should probably do the same\n\ngood night and give your fellow man a little more credit than this.  and read my post.  you might agree with it", "And what about empathy for the people that this guy chose to target? And the other 18 year old who doesn't have a fully formed brain who decided the guy's mom could handle the situation?", "i\u2019m 65 dude.  i just remember what\u2019s it like to be a teenager and can empathize because i was shy at that age. \n\napparently you guys lack the ability to do either. and by the way- others agree with me", "i don\u2019t get this?", "ya know what - that other kid was smart enough to second guess what he had done - which is exactly why he posted his story\n \nlook neither of us knows the exact nature of what he said. clearly you are imagining the worst and i am picturing  juvenile  funny (per his cousin) but rude harmless comments.  \n\nand the cousin wasn\u2019t even bothered by it at first.  he had to go home and think about it\n\nthis kid doesn\u2019t sound dangerous just lonely and misguided", "You're projecting bro. Only thing said about him is that he's a computer nerd, how did you extrapolate the rest? You're painting him as some friendless, lonely, harmless victim, but all we really know about the guy is he harasses people online.", "the rest is understood. it goes with the territory.  and fits in with the narrative. \n\nif you bother to give people a little credit,  look at both sides and/or put yourself in their shoes \n\nit not projecting. it\u2019s called empathy \n\nyou are right tho. but the cousin said they were funny but rude.  rude is what teenagers do. \n\nand everybody leaves nasty comments on every social media platform.  including this one. anybody who posts something expects that. hell some people love it", "\n>if you bother to give people a little credit, look at both sides and/or put yourself in their shoes\n\n>it not projecting. it\u2019s called empathy\n\nWe don't have both sides. I doubt even OP understands his counsin's motivation, never mind you, an internet stranger who has even less information. We don't even know if he's shy. He could just be an asshole who gets off on being an asshole. \n\n>but the cousin said they were funny but rude. rude is what teenagers do.\n\nNo he didn't. He said that some were ridiculous, he never said funny.\n\n >and everybody leaves nasty comments on every social media platform. including this one. anybody who posts something expects that. hell some people love it\n\nSo is your argument that it's fine? I don't expect someone to harass me based on these comments, and if they do I'll report them.", "\nhe said comically ridiculous. That means funny in some sense of the word.   If not he would\u2019ve just said ridiculous.\n\nI know of course it doesn\u2019t make it right but it doesn\u2019t make it a sin. and it certainly doesn\u2019t make it something so egregious that the kid couldn\u2019t talk to his cousin himself. He did not need to involve the mother. that was the only question", "so you never made fun of anybody as a teenager??  never sat snickering with friends in the cafeteria??   never saw somebody trip and laughed?\n \nwhat are you - Saint AdCold?", "\n>he said comically ridiculous. That means funny in some sense of the word. If not he would\u2019ve just said ridiculous.\n\nComically ridiculous, not that the harassment itself was funny. Very different.\n\nYou seem to agree with the cousin, that stalking and harassment are not really a big deal, just a bit of harmless trolling after all, right? \n\nHe was proud of it, and still doesn't think he did anything majorly wrong, so he clearly hasn't changed his mind. Talking to his mother was fine.", "Are you really 65?", "NTA and in the end it is great his mom stopped him before he ran afoul of cyberbullying laws. Those laws are expanding pretty rapidly now and other ones are being used to criminally charge that type of behavior. It just isn't worth it for a laugh to ruin someone's day/week/???. Beyond the whole it is just mean of course. You are both still young so hopefully he matures and realizes it was good he got stopped without serious consequences.", "NTA. What -you- did was childish? That\u2019s some impressive projection there.", "HEY KID!!   we need some CLARIFICATION here!!!\n\nwas Ian just leaving random rude comments on like TikTok videos?  ya know like \u201c you call  that dancing? My dog can dance better than that\u201d.\n\nor was he hunting certain people down and saying hateful things and cyber stalking??\n\nthere\u2019s a huge difference so let us know if you can"]}
