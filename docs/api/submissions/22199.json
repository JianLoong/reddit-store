I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your mother and now the mental loss of your father. Do you have any family or close family friends near by that can help out? He needs to pull it together somehow. If he didn\u2019t have you there and he acted this way still undoubtedly the younger kids would likely have been taken by CPS.", "NTA. This is NOT your job. You are NOT the mom or wife. Your dad is in a severe depression and needs help. You need to talk to teachers or counselors and tell them you need help. Next year you will be in college. You probably won\u2019t be living at home. What will he do then? When will watch a 6 and 8 yo? Who will feed them? Who will put them to bed? Your dad is doing what is called parentification. This isn\u2019t healthy or smart. Your dad needs help. As much as it\u2019s not your job to get your dad to see this or to get help\u2026unfortunately there aren\u2019t many options. Is there a relative you can contact for help? A grandparent? An aunt or uncle?", "NTA. It\u2019s horrible but he needs to be better. He needs to get to a place where he\u2019s not so dependent on alcohol that he can have a mature conversation with you. And please be careful with him. I don\u2019t want him getting a DUI, or worse, hurting or killing someone due to alcohol.", "NTA. Your father is grieving but so are you. Do you have any family or know any of his close friends that you trust that can help you talk to him? It is also worth seeing if your grandparents can visit for a few weeks, help you and see what is going on. Maybe they can help put together a more workable support system. This is an awful situation all round but you can't carry the family by yourself.", "NTA. Sorry for your and his Lost, BUT you need to stop doit everithing because he need to undertood that you also Lost her and that you are is kid, not his wife.\nYou said he need to see a terapist, BUT I think you need It also. \nWhen you can, ask him .. What he is gonna do when you go to uni or find your own place??", "NTA, your dad needs to understand that there are boundaries and lines he shouldn't cross. sure, he can be thankful that you're helping him but just assuming that those r your new tasks and even not seeing you as a kid anymore is going too far. You did what you had to do and maybe now he'll finally see what went wrong and he might go to seek help (I don't know your dad but I assume this is what my dad would do lol)", "NTA, It's wrong for him to treat you like a housewife when you're HIS CHILD. It's also creepy if he sometimes calls you by your mother's name. I get it, everyone is grieving after a tragic loss, but some lines should never be crossed.\n\n You're a wonderful big sister but you should be able to have a happy life too and not have to raise your siblings like they're your children. Just because he lost his spouse doesn't mean he can fob off responsibility of being a parent. You should talk to other family members and someone at school about his behavior.", "He probably needs a grief therapist, and he definitely needs a nanny / baby sitter.\n\nYou did not go to far.  It is NOT your job to raise your siblings.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHorrible situation for everyone involved. You aren't doing anything wrong, and I hope that your dad is able to recover.", "NTA at all. Parentification is abuse. Do you have a trusted adult - a school teacher, a neighbour, a friend's parents - you can speak to about this? Your dad needs to get a grip. Yes, he lost his wife. But you lost your mom. He doesn't get to dump all her responsibilities on you because he's depressed and refusing to seek help.", "NTA. And it's time for some tough love.  You need to get your grandparents & aunts & uncles involved. \n\nHell CPS if you need to.", "NTA\n\nAlso, do you have aunts, uncles or grandparents to turn to for help?\n\nThis is a difficult situation and you could use all the help you can get.\n\nI wish you and your family a lot of strength and people to help you.", "he's calling you your mother's name. he needs a serious fucking wake up call, like yesterday. you lost your mother and are holding things together, he has no excuse. NTA. he needs to be a parent.", "NTA\n\nI would also write down what you told him and give it to him. He may not remember what you said. \n\nMake it short and easy to read like you've done here. Make sure you include the positive things as well like you did in the first paragraph. Be sure to include that you still love him.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I hope that the memories you have can bring you some comfort.\n\nHe may need help finding therapy.", "Depression is a hard trap to escape and will take years. \n\nNta", "NTA. Your dad is the adult here and, despite the grief - the SHARED grief, because three kids lost their mom, too - he needs to understand and appreciate the assistance you're giving rather than having you shut down as completely as he has. What happens next year when you turn 18? You could simply move out and then what? Your younger siblings go feral because he  hasn't gotten on the path to healing?  \n\n\nDo you have another trusted adult in your life? His parent(s)? Aunts? Uncles? Someone who isn't his hid needs to read him the riot act to get himself together or make a plan to help take care of those kids, because it's not YOUR job. I think you're awesome for doing it, but you shouldn't HAVE to do it.", "NTA and although you\u2019ve been great in helping your younger siblings it\u2019s time to pull in your relatives to help get your dad under control.  His behavior is NOT okay and you having to be the mom is not healthy for you either.", "NTA.  No, You aren't in the wrong in any way here. Yes, your dad is grieving, but he is putting too much on you. The fact that he sometimes calls you by your mother's  name indicates that he isn't processing in a healthy way  and is in need of intervention and proffessional help. \n\nIf he won't ask for help, then you need to do it for him. Do you have a trusted adult that you can go to? If not, then go to guidance at school and tell them that you need help contacting resources to help your Dad. Or call a crisis hotline number if that is what it takes. \n\nPlease, don't wait too long.", "NTA, he may be going through things, but he's not doing anything to try to get better. It may sound harsh, but he declined therapy, and drinks, when you told him to get help. You, a child. He shouldn't rely on you because of his mental health, it's not your burden to shoulder on top of mourning your mother and taking care of everything. He is supposedly the last pillar keeping the family together, or at least he should be as a father, even if it's hard. If an adult cannot take taking care of his kids and getting therapy, how can he expect a 17 year old to do so?\n\nI hope you yourself have access to therapy, or at least that you have people to talk with irl. Shouting at your dad may feel like it's bad, especially since you seem to have a good relationship with him, but you're expected to replace your mom, you're probably still in school, and you yourself are affected by your mom's death. Anyone would snap. So long as you talk it out with you and have a way of letting out emotions so it doesn't happen again, you'll be fine.\n\nWishing you the best", "NTA\n\nListen, you're completely correct. Youre a child, youre not your mum, you shouldnt have to deal with all of this at your age. He does need therapy, now. And so do you\n\nHes obviosuly not handling it well. And he's in the wrong for treating you that way. But with this immediate situation, something really stuck out to me\n\n>7 minutes stare\n\n\nAs someone who suffered from depression, and tried to commit on multiple occasions. This has me worried. I'd, for tonight, apologise and try and have talk with him, but don't push him away. HE NEEDS TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE NOW", "NTA.  However, you need to sit him down and set the boundaries of what you will do / not do.  And with it, a list of what he expected to do around the house, now your mother is no longer with you. Working, drinking and sitting watching TV is not parenting.  He needs to step-up.", "NTA, your dad it's selfish, he's suffering, everyone is. But I bet that he can put himself in your place, it's a lot of responsibility, like, calling you by her name? Such an asshole.", "NTA. You are all grieving. What is his plan if you go off to college soon? Do you have any family you can talk to and get some help?", "Tell him you lost your mom, too and now it\u2018s like you\u2018ve also lost your dad.", "NTA. Tell him you will move out at 18 and then he has to see were he is going with your siblings. Either he gets his life together or he loses them to the system. You are mourning too, but everything you are doing ist playing house with your dad which is bizzare in so many ways. It's good that you said something in a volume he can't miss. You are an adult soon, learning to be a woman without the help of your mom, like my mom did when she was 21. I am so sorry for your loss and I feel sorry for your dad, too, but it seems he hasn't completely realized that you won't live in his house forever (you really need to get out of there, find a job, then he already realizes that you are not the housewife in this relationship if you are gone working for the day. Good luck with everything.", "NTA. You're still grieving, too, and your grief wins because you're the kid and he's the parent. End of story.", "NAH.\n\nYour dad is suffering and he does need to work to take steps to get himself together - I don\u2019t know what that looks like for him, whether it means therapy, meds, reaching out to friends and family, lifestyle changes or something else - but at the moment he\u2019s not the A.  He will, however, become the A if he does not quickly start working to make things right, now that you have been so clear about the effect this is having on you personally.\n\nYou are very definitely not the A, you\u2019ve given vast amounts of physical and emotional labour to keep the family going in the wake of a devastating loss, and your response to it is 100% understandable.  You did not go too far, you expressed yourself honestly and I hope that can be a starting point for your dad\u2019s recovery, as well as your own (as I suspect you yourself have plenty of grief still to process, which has been put to one side whilst you support others).", "You are also grieving your loss.\n\nYour father is the parent. He needs to start acting like it.\n\nIs there a relative you can talk to? Your dad needs help and you probably need therapy too.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Of course it\u2019s better when we can express things without yelling, but sometimes we lose control when pushed past our limits. And the way your dad is treating you is completely not ok. He might need to be yelled at for that go go through. Or he might need other help. Do you have any aunts or uncles or grandparents who might get through to him? Or a social worker? Or talk to a teacher?\n\nOf course he\u2019s grieving. But so are you and you are a child still! Expecting you to take on the role of mother and homemaker at 17 and raise your siblings is not an ok way of dealing with his grief.\n\nParentification of children is a form of abuse. He\u2019s doing it out of grief and depression, not maliciousness, but it\u2019s still neglect and abuse. You need to get another adult in your life to help step in. They need to either get your dad to step up to the plate and parent, or you and your siblings need to live with a different adult such as a relative, who can actually take care of you, for a while.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your mom. You\u2019re entitled to grieve just like your dad. You really shouldn\u2019t have been the one to step up, that\u2019s your dads responsibility. \n\nYou need to talk to another adult about this. Someone you trust. Not necessarily for yourself but for your siblings. \n\nEventually you\u2019re going to be off doing your own thing whether that\u2019s college or a job or whatever you want to do. \n\nWho will care for your siblings then?\nNot you, it\u2019s not your responsibility. \n\nIt\u2019s been a year, your dad needs to get his shit together.", "Death and grieving are personal to the individual and some don't handle it as well as others.  \n\nDo you have someone you can call, like a grandparent or does he have siblings?  If so I would call and explain what is going on.\n\nI would try this route before CPS and opening a whole can of worms that you won't be able to unopen", "NTA  Your father is grieving hard, but that's no excuse for putting such a big burden on you. Do you have any relatives or friends you can reach out to? You shouldn't have to carry this by yourself. If there is no family to help get on Google and start looking for grief groups, they may be able to help. You can also call your doctor and ask to speak to a social worker, CPS is a wonderful source for services - people often overlook that they do more than investigate. You need way more support than Reddit can offer.", "NTA", "NTA at all. You need to start thinking about your exit though or you'll be stuck doing this for potentially a long time. You need to get him to see that you will one day leave to go to college or just to have your own freedom, and he has a limited amount of time that you'll be there to help. You should also dial down many of those chores. Make him step up or he gets no dinner or clean clothes, and then stop doing the same for your siblings.\n\nIf at any stage you decide you simply don't want to help, then stop. It isn't your job to do any of this.", "I'll go as far as NAH.\n\nYour dad is not well and needs help. I think that, the silence your dad gave is as good of an acknowledgement that you're right. A lot has been placed on you since and it isn't fair. You also need help.\n\nThe popular reddit response is to get therapy, and I consider that an overused recommendation. I think it does apply here though.\n\nUltimately, and this is sad, if your dad can't get it together, you will be an adult soon enough.", "NTA \u2014 I am so sorry for your family\u2019s loss, but it isn\u2019t your job to hold things together for everyone else. All of you are grieving. All of you lost someone important. You had every right to speak up and I hope he hears you, seeks help, and things get better for all of you.", "NAH\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss darling, you don't deserve to take over as the maintainer of the house you're only a child. And I bet it was so tough to just step in after she died and try to act calm and look after your siblings and your dad. You should be able to enjoy fun teen activities and I find it so sad that so many families end up becoming so dependant on the eldest child for looking after them. You are completely justified to your feelings and this is such a frustrating time for you all I'm sure so of course you should be able to share your inner feelings to him.\n\nI can also understand how your dad is grieving. You have to understand, men of older generations don't believe in therapy due to it being 'not masculine' since they believe they have to be tough and strong and are afraid of showing their weaknesses. However, just remember it won't be like this forever. This is just such a traumatic situation and it's never going to work out finding someone to pin the blame on, and there's no such need for that. Healing is the best approach.\n\nI would recommend talking to your dad about group therapy (you and him), because there's less of a chance he will decline because you will be there too. You'll probably have to start talking first, until he eventually opens up. Any loving father would feel devastated to hear the hardships their child is going through, but this angst should only strengthen your bond together and you'll be able to open up about the situation together and recall happy memories of your mom together.\n\nHowever remember, I know you are focused on the fact that he is grieving, but so are you. You deserve the right to grieve and you are fully entitled to it.", "NTA, but you should have brought it up sooner before you exploded all over him.", "NTA, with a caveat.\n\nWhile I do believe you are justified in your frustration, the way you blew up was over the top. Given how you described his reaction he probably realized you were right and didn't know how to respond. That being said, you both are still dealing with the grief of your loss and the changing dynamic of your family. You both need to cut each other some slack.", "He lost his partner, you lost your mom. He decided to have you, you didn't decide to have a family to care for. He should be caring for you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But I'm sorry, it doesn't sound like it registered with him. If he doesn't change today, you need to call social services/CPS for the sake of you and your siblings x\nIf you suddenly stopped, he won't do these things in your place.", "NTA.  I know you feel bad for yelling at him, but he needed to hear it.  Hopefully, his silence was an indication of him trying to process what you said.  The two of you really need to have a discussion about his parentification of you.", "NTA \n\nSure- a lot of this is depression and grief. \n\nIt\u2019s also *entitlement*. I\u2019m not sure how a parent sits down and asks their kid what\u2019s for dinner and are the kids in bed yet without realizing something is off. \n\nHeck my own husband wouldn\u2019t do this. If he works late he comes in, asks if the kids are in bed *so that he can help if not*, and doesn\u2019t ask about dinner. Because what the heck. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP. You needed to call it out. You\u2019re also grieving. \n\nHe needs to make the choice to seek help.", "NTA. I am so very sorry for your loss, OP. I hope that you get the chance to properly grieve your mother's passing. You should not be made to handle all those things in place of your mom, and if your dad can't do it he needs to hire someone who can (maybe a nanny, cleaner, etc). I lost my mom at 29 and even though I didn't live at home, there were so many ways my dad transferred things my mom would do to my sister and I (emotional weight, decisions, etc). I feel for you so much having been forced to step into such a big role that should not be your burden.", "NTA.  You're NTA at all, OP, and your dad needs to get it together because what he's doing isn't fair to you.", "NTA - Your feelings are valid. It's not your job as a 17-year-old to hold the household together, to be the adult. That's his job. And as a parent of three children who lost their mother, he has to step up. You've made a valiant effort so far to keep everything on track but this is really unfair for him to allow this to go on. So unfair.\n\nIt may be helpful to talk to him when you're both calm and tell him how you feel. It could be helpful for you to write out beforehand the main points  you want to say and have them on your phone so you can remind yourself.  Things like: \n\n* I understand that your grieving because I'm grieving too. Losing mom has hit all of us hard. \n* I have been doing my best to help pick up the slack but I can't do it anymore.\n* I've held it together the best I can but I snapped last night because I am exhausted and I feel like you don't see how I'm struggling too. \n* It seems like you're depressed, and I understand that, but you need to help yourself. I'm 17, I can't make you get help, you have to do it on your own.\n* I know this is hard, but I lost my mom and I NEED MY DAD right now. \n\nAdd whatever else you wish you could say to him to this list. And really try to stay calm and say what you need to say. \n\nSending you all the strength and love for this conversation and the time ahead.", "nta he needs help", "I think this is a case to talk to someone official. Your dad needs to be forced into therapy and you don't have the power to do that.\nThe best start would be a good school councillor. Also the school councillors of your siblings. Or maybe some helplines ect. \n\n\nThis is above your capabilities. Your father has serious mental health issues and needs treatment. You need to return to your normal role as child of your parent, the parental work that your father cannot do needs to be given to a nanny, home help etc. There might even be government resources for this depending on your country.\n\nPlease seek out some professionals.\n\nYou also need strong words with your father of course, what is is doing is actually abusive to you.\n\nIf he refuses to do anything or listen, try and leave the house the moment he is home. Don't clean so much, make a fair and age appropriate chore plan for the entire family including dad and do your bit, no more. When you are done, leave to the library or a friend's house.", "NTA. It's clear he relied a lot on your mother to mother him and their kids and he's putting that burden on you. He needs to learn to step up, feed the kids (including you), and parent his children himself. It's good you're helping, but he will rely on you completely until you stop.  Your young and youth goes by quickly. Enjoy it! Be helpful, but don't be a mother to your siblings and your father.", "NAH, just a real shit situation for everyone. \n\nGet some family therapy.", "NTA but it's time to pull in another adult. Aunt/Uncle/grandparents. You dad is in denial and well into a drinking problem. He needs therapy to deal with his grief and his children need support too.", "NTA, your dads lost his partner, yes he is going to be depressed. But he has 3 kids to pook after, he cannot check out now and leave you to take care of it. You're a teen who should be doing teen stuff, not stepping up to the plate because your dad doesn't want to.", "You're not the AH for yelling at him. You reached a breaking point and snapped, which is very understandable. You are going to have to talk to him about this situation, but don't be surprised if it doesn't sink in. He sounds very depressed and can't see beyond his grief. Are the any relatives nearby you can talk to? Maybe ask them for help? It's unfortunate that school isn't in session because they might have resources for you.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this and condolences for your loss. (((hugs)))", "NTA, you did not go too far. Your dad is suffering but so are you. Im so sorry for your loss. Your dad needed to hear that and what he is doing to you is wrong, and he needs to pull his head out of his ass even while he is grieving. Do you guys have any other family?", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. Sensitive question: Did your mom take care of all of these things before her passing? If so, your dad took her for granted and is doing the same to you.

Talk to a school counselor.", "NTA. Unfortunately, this happens a lot. The oldest child often becomes a parental figure to younger siblings when their primary caretaker passes away, especially if their other parent is consumed by grief, but that doesn't make it right or fair.

You have really stood up for your siblings, and that's great, but as you say, you're also one of the kids, and you're very much grieving too.\n\nYou did the right thing to remind him of his responsibilities, and while I'm sure it feels even worse right now, I'm sure he will recognise that. It's likely that he has been drifting and trying not to confront the reality; hopefully this will be the wake up call he needs. Maybe in the morning see if you can have a proper conversation with him - start by acknowledging that you're both struggling with grief, apologise for yelling if that would make you feel better, but tell him that you very much stand by the content of what you said.\n\nI sincerely hope things get better for you all.

At some point as a parent he has to be aware of what\u2019s happening here. Sure grief is a fog but if he\u2019s asking these questions he is well aware of the logistics of what needs to be done.

It is a case of both her and her father needing to get proper support whether it is around the home, or with a therapist.", "I don't think anyone is denying he's an asshole, he's just an asshole that people can empathize with.
