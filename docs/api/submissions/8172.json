{"id": 8172, "submission_id": "10k7hyn", "title": "AITA: Putting foot down - sister", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI 25(F) have a pretty unique family situation. Every vacation for the past 10 years has been completely controlled by my 27(F) sister. Neither I nor my parents have ever had a say in what happens on vacations. Lodging, location, activities all planned by her funded by my parents. The reason for this is because my sister displays narcissistic behavior - throws tantrums and ruins things when things don't go exactly her way. If God forbid you decide you don't want to do the 2pm ferry ride she gives the entire family the cold shoulder and sets out to make these expensive vacations nothing but pure hell for everyone until we do what she wants.\n\nFast forward my mom and dad are now divorced but they take her on fancy week long solo trips twice a year. I have yet to have a single vacation with either of them. I'm currently pregnant, and have a very high risk pregnancy so I can't do stairs (bedrest). I asked my mom if we can do a simple trip to the beach, nothing fancy before the baby comes. Well my mother felt bad not inviting my sister (she didn't feel bad not bothering to invite me to all the fancy vacations she's taken my sister on). Sister then said we are either staying in an apartment (several floors of stairs up) within walking distance of downtown Charleston or the trip isn't happening. I explained we need accessible housing (no stairs) because I'm on bedrest. She visibly rolled her eyes and said that SHE needs walkability. I explained I won't even be able to walk anywhere. The idea was to get a house on the beach so that I can sit on the porch and enjoy having the view since I can't even walk on the beach. She throws a fit and says she's not going to sit on the beach all weekend ect... the other thing is we offered to split the cost with my mom. My sister makes triple what my husband and I make and she says she's too poor to contribute - might have something to do with her 200 pairs of shoe collection and 35 designer handbags... so not only is she demanding to have things her way but she's not even contributing financially. Never has. \n\nSo she was saying all these nasty things to my mom. My mom comes back to me and asks why I just can't compromise with my sister. I said because at some point someone needs to put their foot down. She then yelled at me for chastizing her parenting. Because I refuse to cave because of my pregnancy restrictions my mom announced there will be no family vacation, and my sister has been so pissed and mean that my mom doesn't want to do a trip with just us, either. She blamed me for ruining the potential for a nice family vacation by causing her too much stress and \"bitching about your sister\". And then said I was making the vacation \"all about me\"\n\nThe real question, AITA for not caving into sisters whims? Should I have just done it to keep the peace?", "created_utc": 1674572695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k7hyn/aita_putting_foot_down_sister/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They caved to your sister's behavior so much in her childhood that manipulating people into getting her way has become an inseparable part of her personality, and nothing is ever going to fix it. Her 200 pairs of shoe collection, insisting on not paying a single penny while 100% controlling every single detail about a family vacation, as well the irrational temper tantrums she throws when someone refuses to obey her are all traits of textbook toxic behavior that you shouldn't put up with. The fact that your sister has gotten your own mom in such a stranglehold that your mom lashes out at you for not caving to your sister's demands because of your pregnancy health requirements is beyond ludicrous. I would not be surprised if your sister actually demanded you get an abortion just so you could be in the kind of physical shape to do what she wants. \n\nAt this point OP, you need to accept that you are never going to be able to take a vacation with your parents so long as your sister is still in the picture.

Did you bring it up to her that you think it's funny how it was no issue leaving you out of a bunch of expensive vacations, but the other way around it doesn't work. I think you should confront your mom with that hole \"seems like you love one of your children more\" issue or forget it and have little to no contact.
