If she didn't want to be kicked out she shouldn't have spread your secret.\n\nAlthough my judgement changes to ESH if your secret is very minor and only a little embarrassing, simply because you're not giving her any time to find somewhere to move to and could potentially be forcing her to live out of her car or something.

If they have, I\u2019m so sorry. If they have not, that means they know your secret and are still your family.\n\nAt the very least, do yourself the favor of disclosing this to someone. Whatever it is, the deep shame you carry is doing you more harm than you realize.", "Regardless of the secret, it\u2019s a huge breach of trust. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for telling her she needs to find somewhere else to live. However, I think giving her such a little amount of time is incredibly unfair. I think giving her a standard 30-day notice is more than fair. Give her time to find a new place, while also setting a firm deadline she needs to meet.\n\nRegardless of the breach of trust, she did have a reasonable expectation of secure housing. In any other formal agreement she\u2019d have more time to find a place before being evicted. I think you should respect the spirit of those agreements and give her more time. Even if you\u2019re not legally required to, I think there is a social obligation. \n\nI also think there needs to be a larger conversation about your relationship. Cos even if she moves out, she\u2019s still your sister. I\u2019m not saying that to say you need to find a way to forgive her or anything. But I do think talking it out will help you both figure out what your relationship will look like in the future, and give you both closure. \n\nYou may also find while working this out with her that you can forgive and maybe you don\u2019t need to evict her after all. Not saying that needs to be what happens, just that it is a possibility. Giving her more time finding a place may help to settle the issues between you and reconcile (if that\u2019s what you want). If you evict her now though, it\u2019s only going to strain the relationship further with her, and likely with the rest of the family. \n\nSo there\u2019s also a degree of deciding whether or not you are okay with that additional strain, and the potential consequences of it (eg less interaction, relationship, closeness with your family).", "Obviously NTA but what's the secret lol \ud83d\udc40", "Depends what it is. \n\nDid she discover you're a hardcore Trekkie (non-issue), find your fursuit (mild) or out you (utterly unforgiveable)? Did she find a weird sex toy or discover that you have an enduring crush on Danny Devito? I mean, it's all different levels of betrayal, isn't it? Whether it's worth making her homeless over it with no notice really depends how severe it is. \n\nContext matters. \n\nIt's hard to make a call without knowing. You could be entirely overreacting to something pretty much nobody cares about or it could be significant enough to cause a family rift.", "This whole thing an all I can think of is what it could possibly be \n\nAre you gay? \nIs it anime porn/henti or whatever? \nDo you have a dildo collection? Is it monster dildos?? \nIs it weird like how some people have houses full of dolls weird? \nIs it weird like you collect skulls? \n\nI'm just \nI'm so curious because you say it's not harmful to anyone or urself but Ive heard people say over an over it's not harmful to anyone/themselves only to say what it is an have it be actually harmful they just never realized it", "NTA. Your sister is the AH. These stories about one person abusing the trust/respect/confidentiality and then expecting to be treated well after really grind my gears. False entitlement. She should have kept the secret safe if she wanted to have a free place to live.", "NTA.  I was caught having my sexual toys and kink stuff in my room. I just pretend that it never happened.  I\u2019m glad you kicked your sister out. I would go NC with her, cause she\u2019s already spreading more rumors about you.  You may want to invent some stuff about her too.", "NTA. but the real reason I scrolled and read all your replies was to find out the secret.", "extra info needed\n\none thing\n\nwhats the secret?", "INFO : what is your rent agreement like ?

She had absolutely no business sharing whatever it is. \n\nBut is it really worth making your sister homeless and potentially losing her job? \n\nThough I only really object to how immediate you want her out without giving her enough time to find another.", "What's the secret?\n\nOh, c'mon. I'm just asking what no one else had the balls to ask", "YTA.\n\nWhat do you expect your sister to do now to protect herself? She either has to leave her job and move and start over again, or couch surf or live out of her car until she can afford her own place.\n\nAll this is because you're embarrassed. You're ashamed of whatever your secret is, how ashamed will you be if something bad happens to your sister now?\n\nEdit: That's pretty impressive.
