During covid my sister lost her job and ended up moving in with me. Im the only one of our family in the area and the arrangement made was that I would allow her to stay in exchange for her covering half of the utilities and some token rent once she got a new job (that all happened).\n\nFor the last few years this has all worked well, but recently she ended up discovering a secret of mine which is very embarassing to have others know of, but only has impact on me and is really no one elses business, this week told our other sisters and our mum about it causing me a significant amount of embarassment, stress and feelings of betrayal.Since ive now been effectively outed as a freak and a weirdo to the rest of my family Ive given her until Sunday to leave before i change the locks. \n\nShes complaining that she has no where to go (no one else lives locally enough to take her in and let her keep her new job).

If she didn't want to be kicked out she shouldn't have spread your secret.\n\nAlthough my judgement changes to ESH if your secret is very minor and only a little embarrassing, simply because you're not giving her any time to find somewhere to move to and could potentially be forcing her to live out of her car or something.

However, I think giving her such a little amount of time is incredibly unfair. I think giving her a standard 30-day notice is more than fair. Give her time to find a new place, while also setting a firm deadline she needs to meet.\n\nRegardless of the breach of trust, she did have a reasonable expectation of secure housing. In any other formal agreement she\u2019d have more time to find a place before being evicted. I think you should respect the spirit of those agreements and give her more time. Even if you\u2019re not legally required to, I think there is a social obligation. \n\nI also think there needs to be a larger conversation about your relationship. Cos even if she moves out, she\u2019s still your sister. I\u2019m not saying that to say you need to find a way to forgive her or anything. But I do think talking it out will help you both figure out what your relationship will look like in the future, and give you both closure. \n\nYou may also find while working this out with her that you can forgive and maybe you don\u2019t need to evict her after all. Not saying that needs to be what happens, just that it is a possibility. Giving her more time finding a place may help to settle the issues between you and reconcile (if that\u2019s what you want). If you evict her now though, it\u2019s only going to strain the relationship further with her, and likely with the rest of the family. \n\nSo there\u2019s also a degree of deciding whether or not you are okay with that additional strain, and the potential consequences of it (eg less interaction, relationship, closeness with your family).", "Obviously NTA but what's the secret lol \ud83d\udc40", "Depends what it is. \n\nDid she discover you're a hardcore Trekkie (non-issue), find your fursuit (mild) or out you (utterly unforgiveable)?

Whether it's worth making her homeless over it with no notice really depends how severe it is. \n\nContext matters. \n\nIt's hard to make a call without knowing.

Your sister is the AH. These stories about one person abusing the trust/respect/confidentiality and then expecting to be treated well after really grind my gears. False entitlement.

She either has to leave her job and move and start over again, or couch surf or live out of her car until she can afford her own place.\n\nAll this is because you're embarrassed.
