I (F25) have moved to another country when I was 18 for study and where I remained to work now.

Should i call someone to remove the (top) glass layer?\u201d. I said i dont mind it and no need to replace. She also rearranged many many things in the apartment while i was on the call.\n\nI go grocery shopping, and once i got back i see she started a load of laundry of my clothes that was in MY closet. I get super triggered for obvious privacy reasons, not to mention cleaning already cleaned clothes. I ask her not to do that again to which she took big offence. Mind u ive lived and done my laundry since im 18.\n\nNext day - another online meeting - she comes in with my jacket to show me how i have a tissue in the pocket and that i shouldnt do that as it could clog my washer. She also after my call told me she will wash my backpack, to which i saw all my things taken out of it laid out on the table as she prepares it to be washed (tnx GOD i didnt have anything inappropriate in that bag). This makes me flip tho for 1. Interrupting my call bc of this 2. Going through my pockets and backpack (again which i percieve as invasion of privacy) and i tell her it would be best to get an airbnb on her own. To which she again took big offense and cried.

Going through your things is a huge invasion of your privacy.  Now if she just was cleaning your already clean kitchen or bathroom I would say let her have at it.  This seems to far to me.", "NTA. You\u2019re setting appropriate boundaries with her. Going through your closet and washing your clean clothing? Rearranging everything? Her behavior is inappropriate. There\u2019s wanting everything clean and neat and there\u2019s her behavior. I\u2019m wondering if she has untreated mental illness. Good for you for not putting up with it and suggesting she stay somewhere else.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m so sorry.  It\u2019s frustrating that your mother has no respect for common courtesy and boundaries. She is a guest in your home.  This is not reasonable behavior.  Air BNB makes perfect sense or the first plane home.", "NTA. She has boundary issues.", "NTA for wanting a boundary but I think you could have attempted to lay them more than once before resorting to an Airbnb and could have been really explicit - that\u2019s what I have to do with my mum who is similar. \n\nEg before I go on a call, I have to say, I\u2019m on a call. Please do not enter this room. I will come out when I\u2019m done and it\u2019s ok for you to enter it again etc. \n\nAs you mentioned, your mum has done this tour whole life and I think it\u2019s a little unfair to expect her to change after asking her once.", "Info: Why didn't you ask her to stop?

If she wanted to stay she should have not crossed your boundaries. I wouldn't invite her to visit anymore. Sorry you are going through this.", "NTA. Tell her to go out to see the sites or shop, something enjoyable. She must be beyond bored if she\u2019s washing already cleaned clothes.", "YTA for having a glass tabletop.\n\nHear me now, believe me later.", "NTA. It's like you were invaded by the psycho-clean Gestapo. Her behavior is way off the rails, and shows a complete disrespect for your as an independent adult. Stick to your guns and don't let her back in, at least until she gets some therapy for being such an OCD parent.", "Oh honey I am so sorry. \nIdk how long she will be staying but you could try to take some days off & take your mom out places\u2026. So many she\u2019s wore out and wants to go to bed when you get home. If she\u2019s out of the house w/you she can\u2019t be rearranging, going through your things or interrupting calls. \nAs for her getting into your stuff this would be my suggestion to teach her but you know her best to know if it would work\nBuy a few vibrators\u2026\u2026. I don\u2019t mean the small rabbits or whatever- if buy the most obnoxious & weirdest  and put one in your backpack. Maybe a blow up sex doll in your closet & maybe leave something in the pocket of a pair of pants or a jacket like a magazine geared to gay, trans, swingers, dominatrix or other s & m.  Once she finds something that would freak her out she will stop going through your stuff. \nMy mom was similar to what you described and I think is probably the Queen of the guilt trip and now that my kids are grown I have to stop and catch myself at times because I don\u2019t want to be like my parents were to me. I make myself stop and remember they are adults & I can not make them do anything, take their car keys from them in order to control them or punish them in by way & I make sure I don\u2019t take their mistakes or any help I\u2019ve given them & throw back at them or say I told you so.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even go through my elementary kids\u2019 backpacks without permission.", "NTA but if she's detailing your backpack I guess you should've just left her a load of laundry and some dishes she could do. Also this story is kind of strange", "Hi, thanks for your response! I did not include it in my post but i did indeed always say when im on a call, sorry for not making that clear. I do agree with you that my reaction was sudden, and i knew how she is, but i guess i get so triggered by this behavior that my tolerance is so so low now even after a few instances\u2026", "This is indeed where i do feel like an asshole part. Upon her arrival i did ask her if she could please let us just enjoy these days together and not be so hyper focused on the apartment. (This is always the case, hotel rooms, her own house, anywhere we go her fixation goes out of hand).  And the main reason i asked her to please not interfere with the space is because i knew my patience with that side of her is running too low\u2026ive done a lot of work on my self but this trigger of not having my own privacy anywhere i go (even in my own home) still gets the better of me\u2026", "I dont think an aesthetic choice that affects literally no one else is an asshole move. Even if it get scratches or is hard to clean or something (I'm guessing that was your point), that doesn't mean someone is an asshole for buying something that they like. \n\nYour comment is valid but like, leave out the official judgement maybe", "I totally get that. I have similar issues with my mum. \n\nHow long is she in town for?", "The fact that you asked her not to do this type of thing upon her arrival makes you NTA in my opinion.  You're an adult who has been one for a long time, she wouldn't (I presume) do this to someone your age if they weren't related to her.  You have a right to your privacy.", "INFO: has your mother ever acknowledged, even obliquely, that she might have a problem?", "I hear what you're saying. Thanks for taking the time.", "You could try send her out to explore the town, local park etc while on calls? That\u2019s what I would do"]}
