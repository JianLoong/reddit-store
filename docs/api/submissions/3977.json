Our evening went great, I got message the kids went to sleep so I thought all was good. The next day we went to pick up the kids and my mom had given my 1 yr old A HAIRCUT! She did not ask me if she could give him a haircut or give me a heads up (which I would've said no). My mom said \"oh I assumed since it was a little crooked you wouldn't have mind\" (she knows I would mind; she often plays dumb to get away with things it's her MO). I don't usually stand up to my mom, it's something I struggle with,  but my brother supported me and that it was messed up. I told my mom as we were leaving if she ever does anything like that again the boys will no longer be allowed to stay with her again.

That was way out of line on your mom's part and not her place to  make that decision without consulting you. Then her DOUBLING DOWN on it is just crazy to me. If I were in your shoes I would be going no contact for awhile, until she's ready to apologize for her wrongdoing- and even then, I probably would not just let the kids back with her unsupervised. She would have to earn that level of trust back.", "NTA!  They are *your* kids.  She needs *your* permission to do something like that.  You gave her a fair warning about punishing her if she does it again and she doubles down and insists on the punishment now *instead of just apologizing!*  \n\nGood, let her have her punishment.  Let her cut off her nose to spider face.  You know she will do this again and she needs concert quenches for her actions.", "NTA.

She overstepped .", "NTA.  It sounds like your mother does this stuff a lot.  Maybe ask yourself if contact with her is worth it.

Or any siblings?", "NTA - you had every right to be upset over this. She is not their parent, so making a unilateral decision to cut your child\u2019s hair without any mention about it to you until you actually saw your child was completely out of line. You get to raise your children the way you prefer and she needs to respect the boundaries that you give her regarding your children. I think giving her only one more chance to prove that she can stay in her lane before taking the step of not letting the kids stay with her is reasonable. (At least this is how I interpreted your response regarding her behavior.) \n\nAt this point, her refusal to apologize or even acknowledge that what she did was wrong sounds like she doesn\u2019t respect you as their parent or the boundaries you have set. You have told her your course of action and what you expect from her to be allowed to continue getting to spend time with her grandchildren, so now it is up to her and her alone to prove that she can and will respect your boundaries. If she doesn\u2019t, she already knows what the consequences for not doing so will be, so you would remain NTA if you have to take that more drastic step.", "NTA. She had no right to cut his hair", "NTA, your mom is treading thin ice here.

I doubt that will change until you change, and break the pattern. \n\nI know how scary that is.\n\nSo start looking hard for another way to serve that commitment.

You deserve to not be bullied.\n\nNTA.", "Im sorry, but if you truely cant do other arrangements, then be prepared for her to play more games.

Our circumstances aren't out of convenience but desperation for child care.  I agree with you,  the way I handled it could have been better and I could have more subtly put distance (if it were possible) and not verbally given such an ultimatum - that's on me .

Throwing a temper tantrum at someone you \"desperately\" need to care for your child.", "You do realize that is technically defined as assault right? Your son can't consent at his age, so a parent needs to. She altered his body without your consent. Both of you need to understand that. NTA.", "You were not too harsh.

That\u2019s the end, now follow through", "Nta\n\nShe was horribly out of line, however, never make a threat that you can't follow through on, per your edit, she knows that the threat isn't an option for you, so she knows the best you can do is hollow threats.", "NTA. How dare your mother cut your toddlers hair off! I'd be so furious! She had no right, and that would be the end of all unsupervised visits with the kids for a Good Long while for me. There would be no more sleep overs or trips by themselves again. Your mom has no respect for you as a parent.\n\nYou should start looking for alternative child care for your kids. I doubt she learned her lesson and might even double down on the boundary stomping.\n\nYour mom sent out a dare with her sarcastic let's make it official comment. Call her bluff and make her realize she does have to respect you as a fellow adult and parent or she doesn't see her grandkids.", "NTA. Your mother was out of line to cut your son\u2019s hair. Sounds like a power move to me. Since you can\u2019t go LC because of needing free child care you made a mistake to threaten her. That feeds into the power struggle dynamic. You will have to make your peace with her overstepping if you cannot make other child care arrangements. IMO it will be useless to say anything more about her crossing your boundaries until you can make consequences stick because clearly she cares more about her preferences than yours.", "Although grandma is correct suggesting that they make it official now, in reality she\u2019s rubbing in the fact that OP has no power to restrict access because of needing childcare. I hope that you take this seriously and find another caretaker because now she knows that she doesn\u2019t have to respect any of your boundaries", "Thank you so much for your response, I really appreciate it. I bet you are an amazing grandma!", "I appreciate all she has done for us in the terms of child care;  I understand all the work she has done and it has not gone unacknowledged. That said, she did something that I feel was completely inappropriate and after reading comments I'm looking for alternative to her care. My mom is the type of person who feels she knows best and can make any decisions she wants as long as she makes a good excuse to go with it. \n\nLook at me as a mama struggling with this not me trying to be an AH. This is my mom and a breach of trust and I feel hurt.", "What do you do with your other child and why can't your 1yo go with them? Why can't your MIL do it? Or literally anyone else.", "Thank you I really appreciate that. I'm checking in with a few other family members but most work full time or we don't have that kind of relationship where I'd be comfortable asking since it is a REALLY BIG ask. I understand the time and emotional commitment it takes to care for a child.", "I'm guessing you don't have children because if you were a parent you would understand that this 1. She thinks she can make whatever choices she feels like for my children 2. She could make more serious decisions on their behalf without consulting me ...oh wait she did I should have mentioned when she gave my child (with nut allergies) nuts because she thought that one wasn't harmful. Don't talk about S you know nothing about.", "Lol, I know that throwing a tantrum at someone whose assistance you're \"desperate\" for is a bad idea. \n\nI also know it's a bad idea to leave a child in the hands of someone who almost killed them, but go ahead, you do you.", "NTA", "It's a haircut. The woman raised you, and you turned out alright, right?", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have cut your child\u2019s hair without your permission.\n\nHowever, you did overreact. Have a conversation and ask her to respect your boundaries. No need to threaten to keep the kids from her forever\u2026 especially when you use her for child care. Maybe she will continue to push boundaries and you will have to LC and arrange for other child care. And you obviously trust her with your children and she raised you.\n\nI do totally get the anger though. I\u2019d have been livid too.", "But grandma watches the toddler every week and OP has no other childcare so not much OP can do for consequences", "I hate that I have to. If I had any other person to watch him or if childcare was affordable I would choose any of those options. We don't have the resources really to have other consistent care.", "You are completely right and I agree with you. I wish it was a threat I could follow through with and after reading people's comments, I am determined to find a way to make it happen. I realize if I don't follow through it will give her more power and realize she can do whatever she pleases. I am just unsure with my limited resources what I can do.", "Thank you and I agree with you that it was a mistake to make a threat I couldn't keep with. I am now speaking with my husband if there are any options to at least keep my mom LC temporarily with our financial situation. I appreciate your words and it helps me to better see the error of my choices and how to move forward,", "I really hope you can find a babysitter/friend or anyone to care for your child. \n\nI found a daycare lady near the kid\u2019s school who said it was fine to drop my kid off for a couple of hours. Only charged $16 because it\u2019s a daycare. \nBabysitters are charging anywhere from $10-$20 / hour. \n\nSuggestion: \nCall daycares around and see if they do drop in (afternoon or morning) and see if something works, OR if they have an hourly rate for a once a week commitment. Explain your situation with regards to needing your son to be cared for once each week. \n\nAlso, it may be time to get creative and check out mom/daycare Facebook groups for your area to see if you can find places or people willing. \n\nFurther, look at your contact list, and see if one person can do one week, another one a different one and have a rotation of people. \n\nIf my friend asked me to watch her kid for 1 afternoon a month, that\u2019s not a big deal. You may have other family/friends like that. Anyone but mom for a bit of a break after this stunt and for your peace of mind. \n\nWishing you luck OP!", "My older child is in a fantastic preschool which I am grateful for. My younger child isn't old enough and we don't have the money to send our younger child to daycare as it is costly. My MIL works many odd jobs so it's hard to predict her schedule and is usually busy and other family members work full-time as well. My parents are well off so they don't need to work which isn't the case for the rest of our family."]}
