My mom countered with asking to having my kids (4m and 1m) have a sleepover at her house which I agreed to as she was doing us a favor and she preferred to have them at her house. Our evening went great, I got message the kids went to sleep so I thought all was good. The next day we went to pick up the kids and my mom had given my 1 yr old A HAIRCUT! She did not ask me if she could give him a haircut or give me a heads up (which I would've said no). My mom said \"oh I assumed since it was a little crooked you wouldn't have mind\" (she knows I would mind; she often plays dumb to get away with things it's her MO). I don't usually stand up to my mom, it's something I struggle with,  but my brother supported me and that it was messed up. I told my mom as we were leaving if she ever does anything like that again the boys will no longer be allowed to stay with her again. My mom did not apologize and only yelled \"let's make it official now!\" I said to her \"that was messed up and I hope you can see why I'm upset\" and I walked out with them kids and went home. \n\nI'm now wondering if I was being too harsh and an AH for threatening to not let the kids stay over again? Did I over react to a haircut? I feel like it was a complete violation. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit to add info:\n\nI need my.mom.to watch my 1 yr old.once a week and don't really have any other options consistently so I can't go no/low contact though I'd rather go NC /LC.\n\nIt wasn't my son's first hair cut but I just gave him a haircut a week ago and I liked the way he looked.", "created_utc": 1670198326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcqbse/aita_for_telling_my_mom_my_kids_wont_be_staying/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was way out of line on your mom's part and not her place to  make that decision without consulting you. Then her DOUBLING DOWN on it is just crazy to me. If I were in your shoes I would be going no contact for awhile, until she's ready to apologize for her wrongdoing- and even then, I probably would not just let the kids back with her unsupervised. She would have to earn that level of trust back.", "NTA!  They are *your* kids.  She needs *your* permission to do something like that.  You gave her a fair warning about punishing her if she does it again and she doubles down and insists on the punishment now *instead of just apologizing!*  \n\nGood, let her have her punishment.  Let her cut off her nose to spider face.  You know she will do this again and she needs concert quenches for her actions.", "NTA. If she's pushing those kind of boundaries now, expect her to try even more in future. If you don't cut contact, I'd definitely say no more unsupervised time with the kids. She needs to earn that back.", "NTA. This time, it was a haircut. If her sense of entitlement is left unchecked, who knows what it will be next time?

It was a display of power.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you leave your children with someone who has proven that you can\u2019t trust them?", "NTA. You were not at all too harsh with your mother.  She overstepped .", "NTA.  It sounds like your mother does this stuff a lot.  Maybe ask yourself if contact with her is worth it.

You set a boundary and warned her what would happen if it was crossed, and she said \"let's make it official\" meaning \"I don't want my child to give me boundaries\" and that's all you need to know when your mother's \"play dumb, do the thing, ask for forgiveness later\" doesn't work, she's just going to throw a tantrum and wait for you to apologize and come crawling to your belly for her forgiveness.\n\nLater on, if you hold to her words, she will probably message you asking if \"you're still holding onto the past,\" and \"I thought you would have moved on by now.\"\n\nJust kindly remind her that she chose to make it official, and if she'd like to admit that she was wrong and that she didn't really want to never see her grandkids again, and take her words back, and also give a genuine apology, everything can go back to how it was, with the exception that she needs to consult you personally before she does anything concerning the children. \n\nShe literally robbed you of the child's first haircut \\[if it was the first haircut\\].

Or any siblings?", "NTA - you had every right to be upset over this. She is not their parent, so making a unilateral decision to cut your child\u2019s hair without any mention about it to you until you actually saw your child was completely out of line. You get to raise your children the way you prefer and she needs to respect the boundaries that you give her regarding your children. I think giving her only one more chance to prove that she can stay in her lane before taking the step of not letting the kids stay with her is reasonable. (At least this is how I interpreted your response regarding her behavior.) \n\nAt this point, her refusal to apologize or even acknowledge that what she did was wrong sounds like she doesn\u2019t respect you as their parent or the boundaries you have set. You have told her your course of action and what you expect from her to be allowed to continue getting to spend time with her grandchildren, so now it is up to her and her alone to prove that she can and will respect your boundaries. If she doesn\u2019t, she already knows what the consequences for not doing so will be, so you would remain NTA if you have to take that more drastic step.", "NTA. She had no right to cut his hair", "NTA, your mom is treading thin ice here.

I hate that I have to have her around as much as we do.", "Start looking now for alternative care. She feels she has the leverage in this matter. I doubt that will change until you change, and break the pattern. \n\nI know how scary that is.\n\nSo start looking hard for another way to serve that commitment.

You deserve to not be bullied.\n\nNTA.", "Im worry, but if you truely cant do other arrangements, then be prepared for her to play more games.  Talk to other parents at your kids school or playgroup, coworkers with kids, local parent groups, etc.", "Let me rephrase: you're still GOING TO use your mom as long as it's convenient for you, but you are perfectly content being breathtakingly rude to her in the meantime.", "Never assume a person's circumstances, you never know what a person's life is like that leads them to certain decisions. Our circumstances aren't out of convenience but desperation for child care.  I agree with you,  the way I handled it could have been better and I could have more subtly put distance (if it were possible) and not verbally given such an ultimatum - that's on me . We usually  have family dinner every Sunday with my parents and siblings but I plan to no longer have my family participate in an effort to limit contact  as  much as I can.", "You know what really looks ridiculous? Throwing a temper tantrum at someone you \"desperately\" need to care for your child."]}
