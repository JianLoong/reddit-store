We're small and have only been open since February so we're not able to pay employees much more than minimum wage yet. Because of this we've had a hard time hiring new people to complete our team. \n\nRight now it's just the manager, me, and two others. Last week we hired a guy, Keith, and I started training him over the weekend. \n\nSo it's just me, Ras, Naya, and the new guy. The night started out fine. I showed Keith how to mix muffins and stuff while Ras and Naya got the front of house ready. Keith seemed like a decent guy. The two of us talked about anime, which is always a good sign for me that I'll get along with someone. \n\nIt all started to go downhill though when Ras and Naya got done up front and came back to the kitchen to help get the baked goods ready.\nKeith and I were talking about a newer anime when Naya chimed in that she hadn't finished it yet. She asked us not to say anything that would spoil it for her. As someone who personally hates spoilers, I agreed to change the subject. Keith, on the other hand, didn't seem happy about that. \n\n\"Are you serious?\" He asked. He went on about how it's not his problem that she wasn't caught up. Naya was red cheeked and apologized to him. \n\nI said \"ummm no. She asked us nicely, it's not a big deal.\"\n\nApparently this was a pet peeve of his, because he went on a whole tangent about how he shouldn't have to keep quiet about stuff he wants to talk about because someone else hasn't watched it.\n\nRas told him that sucks, but we personally would rather drop the subject so Naya can enjoy it later. He then tried to change the subject to something else. \n\nAnd then this asshole just laughs, looks at Naya and names three characters that die. He's like \"there, now you're caught up.\" Then just tries to laugh it off like that was cute or something. \n\nNaya just goes back to baking, but I could tell she was pissed. Ras left to have a smoke, clearly upset themselves. I knew what I had to do. I told Keith that he should leave. \n\n\"Are you serious?\" He seemed genuinely surprised. I told him yeah. Clearly things weren't going to work out with him. He left in a huff. \n\nThe manager spoke to me yesterday, upset that I fired this guy without consulting him. He thinks it was a stupid reason and i was just being harsh. I on the other hand think that if this is the way Keith acts, on day 1, then I can't see him being someone I want working with my crew and I. I can only imagine the issues he'd bring in the future. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for firing this guy?\n\nEdit: just to be clear, I do have the power to fire people.
