I ordered stuffed animals, window decals, art sets, a kiddie telescope and binoculars, a camera, and a couple chairs for her to sit outside. \n\nMy wife, FIL, and Rosie were able to go out a lot more than when we were there with the family and they were even able to visit a national park in the area. \n\nBetween Rosie\u2019s new gear, the trips to the national park, and staying up late bear watching every night, she saw bears on more than one occasion. She\u2019s feeling much better and they\u2019re coming home on Monday.", "created_utc": 1694925368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16krjmn/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_wake_our/", "score": 1654, "replies": ["What a nice update.

I can tell how much you love your family just from the few paragraphs you\u2019ve written. You seem like a really good dad. :)", "I am so happy to see such a nice update- honestly the original AITA is one of the worst I'd ever read, and I am so so glad that things were made right. Major kudos! \ud83d\udc3b", "\\*thumbs up\\*", "Excellent job! I know you just want her to be healthy, and rest is important, but mental health is super important, too. You really made things right.", "Well done! You fixed the situation and made your girl very happy", "Good.", "Hell yeah.", "Thanks for updating us! You did so good, Papa Bear x", "Yesss! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re making this right. And so glad she got to see the bears finally!", "Yay!!!", "Thank you for your update! I'm so happy to hear she was able to spot the bears!", "She actually managed to see them 3 times. Once at the national park and twice from her window. My wife FaceTimed me so I could see her reactions and it was adorable. I have a few more surprises waiting for her at home", "Thank you", "Well done.  I\u2019m glad to hear you listened and were able to help her see the ears!!!!", "Yay!  This is my favorite update of all time!  Congratulations to Rosie and WAY TO GO OP!  \n\n\nSending wellness prayers to your family.", "Lmao the comments reassure me I wasn't the only disturbed soul who needed closure from that horrible first post", "Your heart was clearly in the right place - and now your daughter knows it, too :)", "Thanks for the update!\n\nGreat you've been supporting her for a second chance to see bears.", "phew disaster averted way to recover, dad!", "Oh this is so sweet. You meant well trying to let her sleep in the first place but I'm so glad you tried to make things right when you realised what this meant to her. You're a good parent!", "Next update, you need to rename Rosie to Goldilocks", "Thank you for the update! I\u2019m glad Rosie got to see her beloved bears more than once. I wish you and your family the very best in this terrible time.", "I can guarantee your wife and daughter really appreciate you making this right, great job man, really", "What a beautiful update. Thank you.", "Thank goodness.\n\nI was really hoping that your assholishness in your first post was just due to dealing with your daughter's prognosis. I am so glad you made things right for her, and I hope you and your wife can repair your relationship as well.", "Aww amazing!! Good job dad! Both on putting right the wrong and not being too stubborn to admit you were. \n\nSo lovely to hear Rosie got to enjoy the bears \ud83d\udc3b", "Awww what a great update! I\u2019m glad you took her back and that she got to see the bears \ud83e\udd0e", "I love this update!", "This update made my day, thank you so much for sharing!", "You know buying lots of \u201cstuff\u201d is no substitute for just being an attentive and empathic parent, right?", "Sweet update for Rosie, but why didn't you go? Did you not want to go or did they not want you to go?\n\nYou were the cause of her justified upset, and I can see how she's hurt. Buying the gear is nice be edgy not be present in the moment now, fur the to\nIme that you denied her before? Send like it could have been a great healing moment.\n\nIf your kiddo didn't want you there, it sucks but fair... If you didn't want to be there.....", "I knew what was coming as soon as I saw this. Let me guess, you were the AH?\n \nEdit. Just read the original. Worse than I thought", "Okay great update for Rosie...but *you* didn't go bear watching with your daughter??\n\nDid you not go cuz you didn't think it was important, or did you not go cuz she (and or your wife) didn't want you there? Cuz it kinda seems like it could have been a healing trip for you and Rosie.... But it would suck if you were trying and they wouldn't let you be there.", "Why did your daughter's name change since the last post?", "Hoping you also apologized to your wife! But thank you for making up for the original incident! So glad there is a healing ending to the story \u2764\ufe0f", "I'm glad to hear she was able to see some bears! I hope you have reflected on your behavior.", "This warms my heart. Best of luck to you and your family and I hope your daughter has many many more years of bear watching ahead of her.", "I was disappointed by the situation before this update, but with this update it is much easier to bear.", "[removed]", " I'm so happy to hear she was able to spot the bears!", "Hey, his kid has leukemia, let him spoil her and make her happy. She's only 10 and he realized he screwed up. No need to rub his nose into it.", "He might not have gone because of work and or the other kids and their schedules as well - they've got several other children, most of them older than Rosie. It sounds like he's really doing his best to make things up to his daughter - I'm sure she'll forgive him for one lapse in judgement.", "Because most people on here use fake names for privacy, and OP probably mixed up which fake name he gave her.", "Rose to Rosie?", "You have brought the bears home, and they live in her bedroom?", "Thanks for updating, so lovely she got to see bears.", "Ahhhh, that's so lovely. Glad she got to see them!", "aaaaw", "I hope you don\u2019t really think you were an AH here. This sub is just crazy sometimes. I\u2019ve been thinking about your story a lot since the original post, and it makes me sad and angry to think of a dad with a sick kid getting called an AH for letting her sleep the night after a chemo treatment. As it turned out, she\u2019d have wanted you to wake her. If you\u2019d known that, you would\u2019ve, but you didn\u2019t so you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s just choosing the \u201cwrong\u201d loving, nurturing answer. It\u2019s not AH behavior. (And I\u2019m still annoyed at your wife for throwing you under the bus the next day.)\n\nLike this sub, and you, I\u2019m glad your daughter got to see bears. I hope your family is well!", "This. She also might've just wanted mom and grandpa there and Dad needed to hold down the fort. He screwed up, but we also need to remember parents of kids with cancer, especially with other kids, need to decompress too. I think, honestly while he fucked up REALLY really bad, like next level fuck up, caregiver burnout brain is real. My mom was a COMPLETELY different person when my dad was dying and he was in home hospice. Understandably so, but I remember her randomly snapping and starting to tear into me over the littlest shit that in the long run didn't fucking matter. Her brain was fried. People make mistakes, even towards the people we love.", "People on Reddit like to let their inner Amelia Bedelia out.", "Haven\u2019t been able to pull that one off yet.

I need to do some mending.", "That is so nice.  Well done.", "Hey OP, I'm glad you worked hard to fix it.

I have one of these, for a hammerhead shark and it is a JOY to track \"Finn\" the hammerhead, every time I get blue. The bracelets are really well made too and comfortable.\n\nI hope your little girl beats this.\n\nI lost my dad to cancer before we even had the chance to fight... so, keep being the good dad. She'll never forget that you made the effort to fix this.", "Good job dad \ud83d\udc4f"]}
