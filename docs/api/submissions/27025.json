I ordered stuffed animals, window decals, art sets, a kiddie telescope and binoculars, a camera, and a couple chairs for her to sit outside. \n\nMy wife, FIL, and Rosie were able to go out a lot more than when we were there with the family and they were even able to visit a national park in the area. \n\nBetween Rosie\u2019s new gear, the trips to the national park, and staying up late bear watching every night, she saw bears on more than one occasion. She\u2019s feeling much better and they\u2019re coming home on Monday.", "created_utc": 1694925368, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16krjmn/update_aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_wake_our/", "score": 145, "replies": ["What a nice update.

You seem like a really good dad. :)", "I am so happy to see such a nice update- honestly the original AITA is one of the worst I'd ever read, and I am so so glad that things were made right.

You really made things right.", "Well done! You fixed the situation and made your girl very happy", "Good.", "Hell yeah.", "Thanks for updating us! You did so good, Papa Bear x", "Yesss! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re making this right. And so glad she got to see the bears finally!", "Yay!!!", "Thank you for your update! I'm so happy to hear she was able to spot the bears!", "She actually managed to see them 3 times. Once at the national park and twice from her window. My wife FaceTimed me so I could see her reactions and it was adorable. I have a few more surprises waiting for her at home", "Thank you", "Well done.  I\u2019m glad to hear you listened and were able to help her see the ears!!!!"]}
