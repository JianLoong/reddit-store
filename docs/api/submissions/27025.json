I'm so happy to hear she was able to spot the bears!", "She actually managed to see them 3 times. Once at the national park and twice from her window.

I\u2019ve been thinking about your story a lot since the original post, and it makes me sad and angry to think of a dad with a sick kid getting called an AH for letting her sleep the night after a chemo treatment. As it turned out, she\u2019d have wanted you to wake her. If you\u2019d known that, you would\u2019ve, but you didn\u2019t so you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s just choosing the \u201cwrong\u201d loving, nurturing answer. It\u2019s not AH behavior.

She also might've just wanted mom and grandpa there and Dad needed to hold down the fort. He screwed up, but we also need to remember parents of kids with cancer, especially with other kids, need to decompress too. I think, honestly while he fucked up REALLY really bad, like next level fuck up, caregiver burnout brain is real. My mom was a COMPLETELY different person when my dad was dying and he was in home hospice. Understandably so, but I remember her randomly snapping and starting to tear into me over the littlest shit that in the long run didn't fucking matter. Her brain was fried.

Bears are cool as long as you stay away from them! \n\nI really thought when I read that first one that your wife wanted to take the kid outside to be see the bear which would have been colossally stupid!

They didn't give us any information about why it wasn't working, just gave us a new shark to follow.

Did that intrusive thought win?", "I didn't know they had a monthly club! That's a great gift idea too!", "They might be a little loose, but I don\u2019t think it would be too bad.

Just say \"Barry is fine but his tracker is having technical issues\" or \"Barry's tracker just came loose.\" and assign another animal. Child still gets to track an animal and doesn't have to think about mortality.", "It's a legitimate question. How would the child feel if he bought the bracelet then a week or two later it stopped tracking the animal due to nature?
