The way you jump through hoops to rationalize equally childish behavior and go out of your way to paint the woman in the worst light possible tells me you'd be a shoe-in for the presidency! Just be sure to get an orange spray-tan and loudly declare how you'd grab women inappropriately", "\"Yes, I am single\" would have been a lot less words.\n\nMy sister is also underage, so...I mean. That kinda fits the vibe you're giving off", "|People use \"fine\" to mean \"I'm agreeing to this but not happy about it\"|\n\nMy husband says \"fine\" all the time and just means \"it's fine\".  At the beginning of our relationship it was so frustrating to me because I'd start asking a lot of questions trying to figure out what was wrong.  It was so confusing haha", "OP was upset enough about the situation to come to AITA to drag it out further.", "I think ESH is the general consensus.", "If my husband wants restaurant ice cream and I want actual food, I\u2019m going to make him pick where we\u2019re going. He\u2019s picky and I\u2019m not; I can find something to eat on any menu so I\u2019d much rather him pick what he wants so I can just work around it.", "True! But then she\u2019s also upset about the choice she made. To me it\u2019s all very childish but I guess if it floats your boat then you do you boo!", "She could also get food in both places, and she woulda probably said if she Doesn't wanna go either place but both were fine to her as far as we know. Now it could be that once they got to the place he went for she could say something assholish like \"why did we come here, I dont want anything here\", then she would be the AH, but we didnt even get that far for it to be a possibility.", "So he's the AH for that? Why is the gf not then? She didn't choose either", "The only mistake OP made was by not having a location set before heading out the door. First thing I would have done was asked the gf what she wanted to eat since she was the hungry one. Like I said, dude can get ice cream from anywhere.  We even pull of the menu of the place we decide upon in my house hold and flat out decide what we're going to order before we even get to a place, that way we're not like those I Don't Know people who stand at the counter and block the flow of customers all day long.", "Why the hell do you think people would even *think* to read your profile before interacting with you at all like some kinda rulebook? \n\nGod lmao.", "It\u2019s amazing that you don\u2019t see how your rant applies to him as well. At no point was he not able to just make a decision himself and throwing a tantrum over being told to make the decisions himself is just as bad.", "ESH If he wanted his ice cream he could have simply picked. She didn\u2019t throw a tantrum till he started shifting the stuff onto her. She said she didn\u2019t want to pick, he could have simply picked it.", "Bro your 3 year old is still in diapers ? What the fuck", "He made a petty decision because he didn\u2019t like her responses. And by that logic she was being extremely considerate by giving him the option to pick", ">asking her input and her very impolitely not giving an input\n\nAnd Him, ignoring her input, then acting like a baby when he isn't told what to do", ">\"Yes, I am single\" would have been a lot less words.\n\n>My sister is also underage, so...I mean. That kinda fits the vibe you're giving off\n\nWow so your sister is a predator she keeps hitting me up on Snapchat with adult pictures so she's stealing other people's pictures to send to me your sister needs therapy.\n\nShe's trying to get people arrested she's underage but she's telling people that she's not and she's sending them elicit pictures she needs to go to jail.\n\nThanks for warning me that your whole family is jacked up. Lol", "It\u2019s absolutely childish.", "Yes, because the girlfriend made it clear from the very beginning that she wasn't going to be the one picking this time and she was leaving the choice up to OP, and OP responded by proceeding to try to get her to make every single decision, even the simplest ones. That would be exhausting.", "She is, which is why people are saying they are both childish and unreasonable and that neither side is being more unreasonable than the other.\n\nOP wanted to give her options, and she stubbornly refused. She's an asshole. OP wanted ice cream and would likely already have an idea where he would get it from and if he'd go through the drive thru or not, but he put that on his GF instead when she is just a tag along because she wanted food. He's an asshole.", "And she can get food from anywhere. Culvers and McDonalds have different ice cream just like they have different food. There's no reason OP couldn't have made a decision when his partner said she didn't care.", ">since she was the hungry one.\n\nNope. HE was the hungry one first. HE wanted ice cream. HE wanted to go out and get it.", "He did he pulled into Culver's she had one actual decision inside or drive thru by that point if her only answer to any questions is I'm not picking thats toddler antics. Like a 2yr old saying no to everything. He was already exhausted she couldn't help just a lil.", "Her responses were \"I'm not picking\" to any option provided, she's like a petty five year old AH and he made a solid choice not enabling her little tantrum. She's all the way in the wong, he isn't even slightly.", "That is certainly a view.  Not any coherent one but certainly a view. You know sometimes I often wish I did have the capacity of mental gymnastics this sub has sometimes.", "Not ignoring her (lack of) input, but not wanting to be told he\u2019s wrong for picking the wrong choice!", "He was just giving her 2 options not making her pick the entire thing. If we're gonna be hypothetical here maybe every other time they do this gf complains about where bf picks that's why he offered two options", "Ice cream is a snack. Wanting doesn't mean you're hungry. She wanted food. Big difference.", "Yeah this is what I don't get. Everyone keeps whining he could have picked but he did.\n\nPeople are ignoring how annoying it is when you ask for input and get back nothing at all. She could have simply said \"I have no preference so pick what you would like\" and I guarantee it would have been received much better than \"I'm not picking\"\n\nIt's not that he was hell bent on her making a decision. It's the fact that when he asked for any kind of input she reacted like a child.\n\nSaying you don't have a preference is a positive reaction. Saying I'm not picking is a negative one."]}
