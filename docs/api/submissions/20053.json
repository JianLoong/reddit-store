Either way stop the drip drip drip of death by a thousand non-decisions and have a conversation where you are putting forward a default position but are willing to change your mind.", "So he threw a hissy fit?", "He wanted her to choose for them, she wanted him to choose for them. Neither of them chose so they went home in a strop. Probably at least some of it was due to tiredness but from the post they both sound immature and tiresome.", "\u201c\u2026.we\u2019re lying in bed when I got a craving for ice cream, I told my gf and she mentioned that she was hungry so we decided to go somewhere that served food and ice cream.\u201d \n\nHe could have gotten ice cream but he didn\u2019t coz SHE didn\u2019t pick where to go. They are both being indecisive and petty.\n\nAddition: I say this as someone who makes decisions. I know what I want and if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll pick if asked. Which is why isee where OP is the problem.", "LITERALLY. everyone else under this post on some \u2018why couldn't you make a decision either\u2019 MISS GIRL REFUSED TO SPEAK UP. Therefore, you will stay hungry tf.", "Omg dude. You've posted this same comment so many times. Why are you copping so hard for OP? We get it.", "He wanted ice cream, he initiated the plans to leave the house and get ice cream. Shes mad because he acted like an asshole, he's mad because he wanted to dump all the mental work onto her and she didnt take it", "She DID use her words. She expressed that she could not choose. He continued to demand that she choose. How is that the gf's fault when she communicated her capacity at the time?", "There was a post somewhere on Reddit the other day about a woman who was sick of her BF always asking her to pick a place to eat, then getting passive aggressive because he didn't want to eat where she picked, even though he agreed every time\n\nNow I'm wondering if that was OP's girlfriend", "Why should she? One of them had to decide, neither of them would. They both sound irritating to be around.", "It's so tiresome to always be the one making the decisions about food. The other one just follows and can then complain about it.", "Op decided and she threw a little temper tantrum", "I mean this post is pretty vague on everything so there could be a million ways for that decision to be more clear. How do you know every decision before that wasn't made by him? He decided he wanted ice cream and she said she wanted some too. So he gave 2 options and she didn't pick either so he picked. Then he gave another two options and she didn't like either so she opted for #3 and went home.", "He wanted ice cream that he could have gotten anywhere. She wanted food, so he told her to decide. How the heck was he supposed to know what type of food she was hungry for?\n\nNTA, OP.", "Yes that's possible. We can only guess so much from this short story though. With the information we have we can only really assume that the gf was being more unreasonable. Don't get me wrong they were both being dumb but she said to go home. When he went home.she got upset for him doing what she asked.\n\nI wish there was more here but I assume op doesn't want to share everything.", "Isn't it obviously more because ice cream is pretty much the same wherever you go? like the ice cream at Culver's or McDonald's is pretty much the same except Culver's puts other stuff in their ice cream like fruit and Candy pieces besides just m&Ms and Oreos.\n\nSo basically the decision was hers he can get ice cream anywhere and it's pretty much going to be the same everywhere.\n\nSo he was being nice and asking did she want McDonald's or Culver's and for whatever reason she was playing games.\n\nTo me it would just be rude to know that I'm asleep deprived and then have me making decisions for you based on the things that you want that I don't know what you want.\n\nHe knew he wanted ice cream he didn't know what kind of food she wanted and for whatever reason she was playing games\n\nAnd she was playing games from the start who just basically says I want food but doesn't make the slightest decision on what kind of food they want\n\nThe dude immediately narrowed it down to ice cream and she just kept it vague until the fight started which because she never ever made a decision in the slightest way on what kind of food she wanted makes it seem like she was just trying to play a game", "Probably because she were the one who wanted to order food, it doesn't matter nearly as much where you get your ice-cream from.", ">throw a little fit\n\nYou're confusing the girlfriend for op. Op was fine going home. Hence he didn't throw a fit", "Who decided to go home and is 100% okay with that *decision* \ud83e\udd14?", "He changed his plan because she wanted food. So he said that they would go somewhere that had both. I\u2019m sure if he was solo or she also wanted ice cream, he would\u2019ve moved differently. But if she wanted food he was trying to accommodate her by going to the restaurant she wanted and asking if she wanted to eat out or take it away.", "He was taking care of a toddler and decided it wasn't worth it. Op made a choice to go home. Which one threw the tantrum?", "\"iM nOt PiCkInG\" - was that op?", "I mean sounds like he was fine with ice cream from either place, and wanted to make sure she had options she liked.", "Omg dude. Is it against the law?\n\nI don't see you \"copping\" so hard for the commenters saying the same thing so many times", ">that she ~~could~~ **would** not choose\n\nFixed it for you.", "\ud83e\udd14", "There is nothing to suggest that in this story. \n\nThe girlfriend could also be making decisions when asked and later getting shit over it. \n\nWe don't know, we can only judge about the information given without making assumptions.", "Except he didnt pick - he kept pushing the decision on her thus why no one got anything.", "She said she didn't care, meaning it was up to him to pick which place he wanted ice cream from. On top of that, he wanted her to decide if they ate indoors or outside, and again, she didn't care. Instead of OP simply making the decision himself then, he went home. YTA.", "We have to assume the girlfriend was being more unreasonable because\u2026 OP is the one telling the story? Because the girlfriend is a woman? Why exactly?", "> *\"With the information we have we can only really assume that the gf was being more unreasonable.\"*\n\nHow did you come to that conclusion? The girlfriend said from the get-go that she wasn't going to pick where they went to eat, and then OP got upset and threw his little tantrum when she held to that and wouldn't make every single decision for him. \n\nI fail to see how the girlfriend is the unreasonable one here.", "Whose idea was it to go out in the first place? \n\nHe wasn't fine to go home, he did it because he was angry that he had to think for himself instead of his girlfriend holding his hand and making every single decision for him. Imagine being so incapable of making any decision on your own that you have a tantrum and give up entirely because you can't choose between going through a drive-thru or going inside to eat.", "The girlfriend decided to go home, after OP presented her with an ultimatum. It doesn't seem to me like either of them is 100% okay with that decision? They didn't achieve any of the things they drove out to do, because each of them wanted the other to make all the decisions. They should just have flipped a coin!", "Yea I think people are missing the point that op asked for her to tell him what she wanted and she said she wanted to go home. Op could have just gone through the drive through but he called gfs bluff and now she's mad", "They both threw a tantrum. OP literally went \"decide or no one gets anything\".", "But going was his idea she was tagging along they're both AHS", "It was both of them lol", "It literally was. He could have just picked something but instead he drove home.", "Yes. He did NOT pick the drive thru or inside. The gf ALSO did not pick.", "Fair but he drove away without any coz she wouldn\u2019t pick. That\u2019s what I find petty. Cutting off your nose to spite your face!", "Because other commenters are not replying to each thread, your literally everywhere. It's not against the law but the other commenter is right lol", "She said she wasn't picking. I guess neither of us knows. As someone who struggles with executive dysfunction, and with the lack of \"she always does this and then complains I get it wrong!\" (Which OP would have definitely included if it made them look better) I'm erring on the side of 'could'.", "Oh yeah, I was agreeing with you.", "He picked ice cream and the restaurant. 2 decisions in this story. Other than that we know nothing of the relationship before or after this.", "OP is giving her options, wanting her opinion. He first asks for her general opinion - she says she doesn't know. He gives her two options - she doesn't want to pick. He gets to the place, and asks if she wants to go in or go through the drive-thru - yet again, she doesn't want to choose. He is understandably frustrated, and adds the option to go back home without food- she chooses to go home. She's then upset that they didn't get food, despite the only time she chose something was the going home option.\n\nYes, she's being the unreasonable one.", "Because this is all the information we have. We can speculate what happened before from this one interaction but it's not gonna be accurate.", "It wasn\u2019t on his own though, you\u2019re conveniently leaving that out. He said he changed his plans to accommodate her wanting to get food as well. He had already decided to get ice cream, she then decided to change his plans, he asked for her to follow through on amending his plans - which she refused to do, so he cancelled the plans.\n\nBut bcuz misandry OP must be wrong.", "Who threw the temper tantrum at home?", "\"she was upset\" \n\nNot op", "And he made the choice to leave. What's your beef with op's volition?", "I'm sorry you didn't know the rules and laws of AITA don't make that a crime", "Oh I'm sorry, I misunderstood you!", "Why did OP decide to go home without ice cream that he specifically left for if he wasn't upset as well? Was he sunshine and daises when he gave an ultimatum and drove home? It seems both were upset as much as you hate to admit the guy had any fault or emotions apparently lol", "His inability to decide whether to get out of his car meant his whole point of leaving the house was a waste of time he left and drove to get ice cream but didn't get it because he was incapable of decided to get out of his car or not its really simple hence all the other ESH votes", "I literally never said it was a crime or rule, I was simply saying the other commenter is right when saying your literally everywhere on this fourm. Your free to do what you want, I literally said it's not illegal or not allowed, just find it hilarious that your trying to throw it to other people when your commenting on this thread more than any other.", "SHE opted to come with. He didn't ask her to. Obviously, when someone says they're hungry, and you've been given options on where to go and you willingly don't say anything -- that's on you. I would've also driven home after my partner acted that way because wtf ? you said you were hungry, after knowing the options, *at least* say what you want ? that whole mess of \u201cyou pick. im not picking\u201d is dumb. Then, still has the nerve to throw a tantrum once getting back to his house ? that would immediately put me off and make me lose appetite as well.
