Edited to add!", "Yes, that's what happened. 1. He wanted ice cream. 2. He decided to go get ice cream. 3. She said, well I am hungry so I will tag along. 4. He said PICK. \n\nHE had the craving first. HE told her Culvers or McDonalds...I am not sure why he threw a fit about her not picking. They are both crappy fast-food places. When he picked one, HE then threw a fit about going in or driving threw. HE was being a bit pissy and acting like a toddler. The solution to this was: \n\nHey, I want ice cream, do you want to go? Her...sure, I am hungry too. Him, ok let's go to McDonalds or Culvers, do you have a preference? Her..nope, you pick. Him: Ok, Culvers. I am going to get drive-through, is that ok with you?

When she said she didn't want to choose, he should have picked his top preference and they would have gone about their evening. Why the obstinate refusal on his part? Seriously, why?\n\nThe best case scenario here is that he was refusing to do the exact same thing she was refusing to do. But she stated her refusal clearly and accepted the consequences for her refusal. He threw a temper tantrum for no apparent reason and then blamed her for *his* choices.", "Same.

The entire mental load for both of their dinning experience is on him and all she all has to do is announce she's hungry? That's not fair. He wasn't asking her to make any decisions for him.", "Idk, I feel like \"I'm not picking\" comes off a little aggressive. Like maybe he could have just picked, but I would be frustrated in his shoes if the person phrased it like that. \"I'm not picking\" is harsher than \"whatever's easier\" or \"I'm happy either way\"", "That's not passive aggressive.

Like if the order was wrong it was because we used the drive-thru and it was my fault because I chose it. Or if there was a longer line inside we had to wait and it was my fault because I chose inside. She could easily have been put in that position one too many times, by the end of that relationship that's how I would respond. By refusing to decide and saying both were okay with me. Because I was going to get yelled at either way so it really didn't matter.        \nOr it could be the complete opposite and she says she doesn't care but is mad if he doesn't read her mind and he's completely frustrated with that.

You can get basically the same ice cream in many places so it doesn't matter. But meals aren't the same everywhere.\n\nWhat if after he chose he got berated for picking the wrong restaurant and wrong way of acquiring the food? And it's not uncommon for them?
