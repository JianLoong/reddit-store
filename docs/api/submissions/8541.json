Ted is close to one of my flatmates. He joins us almost every week. A few of us don't like him because he is an obnoxious as* who just wants to \"play devil's advocate\". \n\nBut depending on the crowd he has a different personality. Usually, when even a single woman is part of the guest list he brings his Sunday Worst out to play. \n\nHe doesn't know I'm dating and he didn't know the only woman in presence at brunch was my girlfriend. My girlfriend came by herself because of prior commitments. The second she came Ted went from normally loud to bird mating call loud. He pulled the empty chair placed next to me towards him for her to sit in. My girlfriend just shrugged and sat down thinking it was some 'dorky hazing ritual', her exact words. \n\nHe decided to order food and drinks for her and said \"I know the cuisine like it's my own. Trust me on this\". \n\nWe're at an Indian restaurant. My girlfriend is Indian. \n\nAnd then he's like \"oh don't think I'm mansplaining by ordering for you.

So, I just watch. \n\nThe waiter comes by again for a second round of orders. He's also indian. Girlfriend casually asks him which part of India he's from so.

And your girlfriend is fucking awesome.", "NTA\n\nWHY DO YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH TED\n\nHe is an asshole\n\nHis behavior is misogynistic \n\nAnd apparently your friends don\u2019t want to stand up against his rude behavior. You could use a new ass friend group.\n\nAlso the info about her being debate-y is irrelevant. Your bigot friend tried a power play and she shut it down. (Edit) And it was personal! And confirms your friend\u2019s racial ignorance. Now your friends don\u2019t want to take sides?\n\nRidiculous.", "NTA to be honest, with the first few paragraphs it was sounding like you were making excuses for her. Studying pol sci and being debatey? None of that was necessary, she wasn't being debatey - just a woman calling out misogyny.", "NTA. Ted was put in his place. Sounds like it was years overdue too.\n\nThat said, you didn't \"let\" your girlfriend do anything, she's her own person and doesn't need your permission to do anything.", "NTA.  Gang up on him?  Your girlfriend stood up for herself. Doesn't sound like there was any ganging. Ted is just in his feels because he made an ass of himself.", "YTA - Ted\u2019s behavior is super toxic. Then he gets called out for being a complete asshole. Now you are here wondering if you should be taking Toxic Ted\u2019s side?! You should have been calling out Toxic Ted for years. Thus YTA for allowing Toxic Ted\u2019s behavior in your group.\n\nHere is some advice. You know how you can pass a sniff test? Imagine this wasn\u2019t a misogyny issue but a race issue. Imagine him saying \u201cNot to be racist, but you brown people always order food you don\u2019t like because you are ignorant and I have to make sacrifices by sharing my food with you.\u201d", "NTA.  How did you get involved in this? As in \u201cganging up\u201d on Ted? Ted\u2019s an idiot. He think\u2019s he\u2019s wonderful, but he\u2019s not. He just had his feelings hurt because he was out of his league. Pity you can\u2019t find a t-shirt for him that says \u201cTed\u2019s been butthurt.\u201d\nTed started this. Your girlfriend ended it. You did nothing but sit there and let Ted hang himself.", "Soooo, you know he ramps up the assholeness around women and decided it was a great idea to bring your new girlfriend to meet someone that is guaranteed to treat her like crap - why??? And he\u2019s racist. So, almost every week, you hang out with a misogynistic racist of your own free will?? Ever occur to you that your choice in friends reflects on you?", "NTA, Marry that woman. She sounds like a keeper. \nTed rightfully got his ass handed to him on a platter. He the only AH here.", "NTA why is he okay with a friend acting that way and not getting consequences ? The time to stop hanging out with Ted was years ago", "NTA you didn\u2019t let your girlfriend do anything, seems like your girlfriend is more than able to make her own decisions and Ted is more than able to make his.\nHe did something stupid and she schooled him for it, people need to stop falling into line behind the person in the wrong just because they\u2019ve known them longer\u2026 Quality of relationship far outweighs quantity of years imo", "NTA\n\n\"and my roommate who's Ted's bud texted on the GC saying it was disgusting of me to gang up on Ted, who I've known for years, with a girl I've known for less than 2 months.\"\n\nNow that I have considered that reasoning, I believe the exact opposite happened, and the story makes better sense to me. You, being relatively distant\\* from with your relatively new girlfriend and respecting her boundaries and overall not wanting to smother her (especially since she can more than hold her own), allowed her to fight and win on her own without you patronizing her, or putting any undue pressure on your friends/flatmates. You didn't even finish off the carcass.\n\nIt was your friend's decision to make such a bold fool of himself. Really the question is, should you have prevented him from making such an ass of himself. But you can't, so no.\n\n\\[\\*Edit: \"Distant\" says a little too much. I am basically trying to convey either modesty or humility.\\]", "NTA\n\nTed humiliated himself by being a presumptuous,  overbearing asshat.\n\nIt also sounds like, even if it weren't perfectly justified,  there was little you could have done to prevent her serving him up (roasted medium rare, with a nice sear) because I believe that the demolition happened much more quickly than the tale can be told. \n\nYour GF sounds fabulous.", "NTA. Ted deserves to be whacked with the chair once in a while.", "\"Hey everyone, I had no idea that my gf was Indian either so this is just a neat new thing that I learned about her too :) \"\n\nlol you're NTA, he did the race equivalent of mansplaining i guess", "Worst TED talk ever!

Good on her!", "NTA for not stopping your gf, but... Why do you hang out with a racist and sexist ahole? These \"oh it's just Ted\" things are part of what makes Teds think their behaviour is ok.", "lol - NTA\n\nwhat?\n\nI enjoyed reading this. It feels more like a brag than anything else though. You didn't need me tot tell you nta. funny shit tho. Good job.", "The only AH is Ted. He pushed her too far and got what was coming to him.", "NTA. Even if your girlfriend was an asshole, which she wasn't, you didn't contribute (at least in your description of events). You definitely didn't \"gang up\" or show a bad face. Only the idiot who placed her order for her without her asking him to.", "NTA. He dug his own grave. What difference does it make if she is your girlfriend or not? He was an AH in either scenario.", "Absolutely NTA. Ted seems like an absolute jerk, and no one should have expected your GF to just sit there and take it. If anything, someone should have called him out on that nonsense a long time ago.", "NTA, and your gf is a queen. I wish the two of you many happy years putting dudes like Ted in their place.", "YTA for wasting your short precious life by associating with, and exposing your GF to, such a goon. Also YTA for assuming in the post title that you 'let' your GF act that way (as if you are responsible for '*your woman*'). But other than that NTA and you're all a great bunch of modern men. LOL.", "NTA That will be the story you tell your kids. Fuck Ted.", "NTA - You watched your girlfriend stand up for herself, as someone was trying to humiliate HER. I would say YTA if you supported Ted.", "ESH except your girlfriend. Ted's an ass, that's obvious. But why have you all been tolerating him hassling women for years?? Get real with your roommates - Ted doesn't live there. Ted's a dick. Ted's banned from group get togethers. Grow the fuck up.", "NTA, he was being a pig and got put in his place. A guy like that is going to keep running into these situations until he learns to be less obnoxious.", "NTA. Ted can dish it out but can\u2019t take it? Not her problem.", "YWBTA if you continued to hang out with racist, sexist, asshole Ted.", "NTA. Unless you're keeping Ted around in the hopes that he keeps getting demolished like this for your entertainment, why do you even talk to this dude?", "NTA. Ted was not ganged up on by anyone. He decided to be an ass all by himself.", "Well deserved! NTA", "First, your girl sounds amazing.  Second, Ted got what was clearly coming to him. NTA.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a gem. Let him dig himself in deep, then administered the coup de gr\u00e2ce. Brava.", "NTA if Ted wants to act like this then this is the very least he deserved.", "NTA. Ted sucks. Did they really expect her to sit through the meal letting him be disrespectful. She could have handled it better than just the childish retort, but I'm guessing y'all are young. Also, it's not your place to police how your GF acts and your friends who think that suck.", "INFO mutiny?", "NTA, and Ted got his just desserts.", "This read like an and-then-everybody-clapped story\n\nNta", "I think you gotta teach Ted how to get girls. He seems so desperate I kinda feel bad for him. Maybe he\u2019ll learn how to treat everyone better?\n\nP.S. Please don\u2019t take this the wrong way I don\u2019t mean anything bad.", "INFO: has Ted\u2019s friend said anything to try to justify how he behaved, or did they just get indignant?", "NTA and I\u2019m baffled as to why any of your friends (other than Ted) would feel differently.  Maybe find better friends?", "YTA. Your girlfriend sounds genuinely lovely, but just the way you wrote this out, you AND your friend both sound like self-important obnoxious pricks.\n\nSHE seemed to have handled the situation with poise. YOU sound not much better than your so-called friend. I say so-called, because you write with absolute disdain.\n\nHere is some advice - Work on yourself before she dumps you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
