Ted deserved what he got for being a patronizing, misogynistic, patronizing ass.\n\nYour friends are assholes for 1) Defending Ted and 2) thinking you have any control over your GF's behavior.

But, you didn't do anything, nor did you \"let\" her do anything. He humiliated himself more than once and she took advantage of the opportunities to let him know it.

I would have loved being there watch her handing it to him as she did.  Both you and her are NTA.", "Y T A for even asking the question.  A totally dumb asshole and you and Ted should hookup.

Not as \"dark-skinned\" as what?  The stereotype he has in his head?  Apu from the Simpsons?  What does he think Indians look like?  Does he think we all have the EXACT SAME SKIN COLOR?  Does he know how many people are from South Asia?  Does he think we all look alike?  (What am I saying - of course he does.)  Just... I can't.  I'm desi and if someone ever said that to me I think I'd just leave the conversation in disgust.\n\nMy only question is, why do you let a racist AH like Ted join you for lunch every week?", "OP get rid of everyone except your gf.", "My response would be, \u201canybody that supports Ted, supports both sexism and racism and I rethought you guys were better than that.  Am I wrong?\u201d", "NTA. Ted was the super AH. And a racist. And kind of a misogynist. \n\nAlso you didn't \"let\" your gf do anything.

That\u2019s a gross exaggeration. You just didn\u2019t defend him. I get why because he seems annoying AF. But had you just introduced her as your GF from the beginning you probably would have avoided this entire situation.
