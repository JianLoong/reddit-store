Your dad needs it.", "NTA - The time for polite ended at physical threats. If you can afford to look at renting a room, a house share or any other way to move out.

Trust me!", "My dad was full on abusive and also forced us to eat. So to me those things go hand in hand.

It took me years to unlearn that behaviour and be okay as an adult to not finish food and not overeat.\n\nHow the hell are you supposed to learn intuitive eating, healthy eating if all you do is overeat to the point of gagging?

You should certainly talk about how this makes you feel, and how harmful it is to everyone.  But also try to understand his concern.  If it\u2019s wasting food, talk about how it\u2019s more efficient to let you choose portions, and save uneaten food as leftovers. If he\u2019s worried that you are hungry or underfed, you can reassure him you understand how much food you need and eat accordingly. If it\u2019s a control issue, that\u2019s harder and above my pay grade.  It could be as simple as he\u2019s overcompensating for deficiencies in his own upbringing-but doing it the wrong way.

He's been abusing you, even if the initial trauma wasn't his fault. That was a long time ago and it's his responsibility to do what he has to, in order to avoid passing his trauma down to the next generations. \n\nI would suggest that you look into various options for yourself, too. You've been traumatized, for your whole life. Therapy, Adult Children of Alcoholics and Dysfunctional Families, etc  are resources worth checking into.

Just like a parent starving their kid is. Your dad needs therapy. Clearly his food insecurity as a child is still impacting him a lot. Forcing someone to eat when they don't want to or they are already full is extremely unhealthy, and it can cause a bad relationship with food and even EDs. Is he physically forcing you or your siblings to eat? Even if it's not physical it is still abuse, but physically forcing someone to eat is also dangerous. Hopefully this will be a wake up call but you should also know that this kind of thing doesn't go away overnight. You can try explaining to him that overeating is unhealthy and dangerous just like undereating, and he needs to let you decide for yourself what and how much to eat because what he is doing is only going to mess up your natural ability to recognize being hungry or full.", "NTA honey, this IS abuse. Just because he thinks he's right, doesn't mean it's not abuse. Just because there's an underlying reason why he thinks this way, doesn't mean it's not abuse. Force-feeding is abuse. Making you feel like you're too scared to leave the table is abuse. Controlling how much and what you eat is abuse.", "NTA, but the statement about his dad was hurtful, so you should apologise. I would speak to him when it is not meal time about how his actions make you feel and how it is harming your relationship with him and with food. You should be allowed to portion your own plates and then go for seconds if you wish rather than him overfilling the plate. Also, ask him why he feels you should listen to him and not your own body when you are feeling full?", "NTA. Your dad needs therapy. And it isn't your job to get your dad to get help.", "NTA, but you two should talk about it. Say you feel bad for saying those things to open the conversation, for example, but that he has a serious problem.\n\nWhat I gather is that your father is still dealing with his own trauma of what happened during his childhood. He has trouble showing affection but still wants his kids to never be hungry. I'd say that he's a good man plagued by his own ghosts, who has never been shown an example of what a functional hosehold is, and that he needs therapy.\n\nIf no one has ever helped him, maybe it's time his children and wife did it.", "Forcing you to eat isn't good. Your body tells you to stop for a reason. My dad doesn't understand anything unless I'm harsh and direct like that. Once I've exploded I can usually go back to him and have a normal conversation with him Where he'll understand  at least a little and makes a bit of effort. Try talking to him. Tell him you feel bad for HOW you said what you did but that the sentiment remains.", "NTA.\n\nForce his ass to therapy this INSTANT. God.", "You are a survivor of abuse and experiencing ongoing abuse. Your first priority should be finding a safe way to move out.", "NAH food insecurity is a painful thing and it has clearly made an awful impact on your father. He should probably seek out some therapy to help him, because in his mind he's doing everything he can to prevent you having to live the life he did.", "NTA but your father also isn\u2019t an AH either. He\u2019s trying to give you what he never had and that is love even if you and others don\u2019t see it and it\u2019s not in the healthiest way. Does he need therapy? Probably. But something to realize is that older generations are only doing the best they can with the resources and emotional intelligence they\u2019ve been able to develop.", "NTA, my father hates food wastage(I get it now as an adult), we went to an all you can eat buffet once as a kid and I took more than I could eat. He wasn't happy, I can count only 2 times my dad has let food go to waste, one was deemed inedible and the other just was nasty(based on taste) \n\nI would say that due to your father's upbringing, he expresses his love by providing the thing that was so scarce to him. I have a feeling your dad has given a very watered down version of his upbringing if he believes he needs to overfeed you. He should seek therapy as you are an adult you may be able to get through to better now.", "NTA But you might have come at it a bit less out of control.  Your dad needs help.", "You have had a chance to cool down and it sounds like you love your dad.  Why don\u2019t you write him a note tell him that you love him and appreciate how he has always taken care of you making sure you had everything you needed including a full belly. But now you need one more thing from him and that is is his trust that you will partake of the wonderful food he provides gratefully but in the right amount for you. Apologize for being so harsh and not finding a different way to tell him. Repeat that you love him and are ready to talk or not but going forward eating will be different.  He has deep wounds and sounds like he has no experience with being cared for so it may take awhile to change but give it a try", "Your Dad went through trauma related to food insecurity and poverty. He has devoted his life to making sure he doesn't let that happen to his family. Some empathy for him would help. Maybe you could have sat down and let him know you weren't hungry but wanted to spend time with him and the family. It could help him understand that food doesn't always equal love. My Dad was similar and would soften a bit if I asked him about his day or told him about mine . Also, it wouldn't hurt to thank him for being such a solid parent and provider. You will appreciate this a lot later in life. If you are interested, look up ACES. It stands for adverse childhood experiences scale. Points are awarded for things like having a parent with addiction, food insecurity and chronic poverty. It sounds like your Dad may have a high ACES score, which explains his behavior and thinking. Best of luck to you both!", "NTA\n\nYour dad IS abusive. He neglects his family by spending almost not time with you, he overfeeds you, he threatens you even if you've said you're full (which is unhealthy, and reminds me very much of growing up with \"there are starving children in China/Africa\").\n\nHe needs to be in therapy to deal with his trauma, not force his trauma on everyone else.", "Your father is abusive and there is no excuse including his own trauma. \n\nCan you get out of this household? \n\nNTA", "Nta \n\nMy dad did the same when I was in high school, I feel like it\u2019s part of the reason I now have a binge eating disorder. He\u2019d come home from work, make something to eat and tell us to join. I would tell him I already ate and he would insist. I felt bad so I\u2019d eat even if I was already full.

Just don\u2019t leave it till it\u2019s too late.", "NTA. I'm sorry to break it to you, but your father is abusing you with this behaviour.  You are right to object to it, but maybe you can all try discussing this as a family to help him see how is is hurting you and pushing you away.  I know it's really hard to accept that a parent is abusive, but the sooner you accept that the easier your life will be in the future.  Dealing with all that after years of denial is no picnic, trust me.", "Your father has been abusing you for 20 years and you've finally found your voice ... NTA. This should have happened years ago, if not you then our mother or one of your siblings.  \nYes, he has real issues concerning food but this is not on you.

While I can definitely relate to your situation, I think it could have been handled differently. Your father seems to carry the neglect of his childhood with him. And I can see how that resonates with his behavior. However, rather than him following the same path as his father, he decided that he was going to ensure that his children would be raised to a higher standard. Essentially one of those \u201cgive my kids the life I never got to have\u201d situations. How that translated into him force feeding? Not sure. PTSD of that nature can manifest in some weird ways, and it\u2019s possible he may have not realized the extent of his actions.

Yes, he is going about dealing with it in a really harmful way, and he needs therapy to understand that, and to find healthier ways to cope with it that don't put his trauma on you, but he's really not trying to be an AH.

Finally, if there are children under 18 in the house, and if this won't result in you being hit or abused in other ways, you might want to let your father know that unless he stops forcing them to eat, you will call  CPS.\n\nGood for you for standing up to him and sticking up for yourself!
