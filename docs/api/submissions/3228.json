Willow said she was almost done and will be leaving soon anyway but I figured it was all good, at least we won\u2019t have to wait for a table.\n\nWillow and Emma only met briefly when I was with Willow. Emma didn\u2019t like her much but was always polite, Willow never cared about Emma. \n\nThe thing about Willow is that she\u2019s not originally from here, she moved here to do her PhD so she has a slight accent. I mean, she speak perfect English except for her accent. Which is kind of a given considering it\u2019s her 3rd language.\n\nWhen we were waiting on our food, Willow was kind of rude, ignoring us, eating her food and being on her phone. I tried to start small talk. Willow replied briefly and it caused Emma to make a joke about Willows accent. Willow looked at her and said \u201cand look who\u2019s talking\u201d (Emma has a strong local accent).\n\nWhen Willow left, Emma started complaining about Willow, how she always pretends to be miss perfect but Emma won me and Willow doesn\u2019t even begin to compare.  This didn\u2019t sit right with me so I told her that I loved her but there\u2019s a lot she could learn from Willow and she\u2019s not half the woman that Willow is. \n\nThis cause Emma to go ballistic and she started crying, which happens a lot most likely due to pregnancy hormones, and screaming at me. I\u2019ve no idea what she said but I asked her to not make a scene. She wouldn\u2019t stop so we had to leave the restaurant without eating.\n\nShe\u2019s furious with me, saying I\u2019m the asshole but after what Emma said about Willow, I thought she needed a reality check. I love her to bits but she\u2019s not all that.\n\nShe complained to my sister and my sister called me telling me I was the asshole. Am I really though?

Yes she shouldn't have done it but she'd been forced into this situation by you and was obviously uncomfortable. Willow returned the dig and that should have been it, they'd attacked each other, end of story. Then Emma, feeling insecure, seeks validation from you, her boyf, and in return you tell YOUR PREGNANT GF that your ex is better than her.

Willow didn't want to eat with you and subtly tried to tell you by saying she was leaving soon and it went right over your head.

Why would you invite yourself to someone's table that your girlfriend doesn't like. \n\nThirdly, you then told your pregnant gf, who probably feels like a planet right now, that she doesn't compare to your ex. The woman, who you are with now, who is about to have your child. She didn't go ballistic because of pregnancy hormones. She got upset because you are a legit jerk who is still hung up on his ex.

Are you even happy to be having a family with Emma? Or is she always going to have to live in the shadow of your ex. Regardless if she made fun of her accent, that is a disgusting thing to say to your girlfriend.", "ESH except Willow. This has got to be fake, everything about this is screaming ridiculous. Your girlfriend, for making nasty comments about a woman who literally did nothing wrong. You are a giant TA, too, for saying that \"she could learn from Willow and she's not half the woman that Willow is.\" WTF, dude. No, she didn't go ballistic because of 'pregnancy hormones', it was because you talk about your girlfriend like a dog who needs to learn good behaviour instead of a partner and a future mother to your child. You're also a TA for bullying yourself into sitting with Willow when she obviously just wanted you to go away.", "YTA for a lot of reasons but the fact that you don\u2019t see how you did anything wrong is the biggest one. \n\nIf you want your ex so badly, go back to her.", "Here\u2019s some advice for you: comparing your partner to your ex is a no-no.

Then you repeatedly insult and demean you gf.  Some of your comments are honestly potential relationship enders.  Not half the woman as your ex?  She could learn a lot?  She is not all that?\n\nYes, she shouldn\u2019t have joked about Willow\u2019s accent.  Yes, willow responded in a sharp manner.\n\nIf Emma isn\u2019t half the woman that Willow is, why are you with Emma?", "Troll.  Also enjoying the Buffy references.", "#YTA\n\n1) Based on your comments, *you cheated on Willow with Emma*. \n\n2) You didn\u2019t *really* want to be with Emma, but when Willow found out she dumped your ass. \n\n3) Willow broke up with you just 4 months ago. Emma is 6 months pregnant. She was already 2 months pregnant when Willow found out and binned you.\n\n4) While heading out to dinner with Emma (your new girlfriend / former side piece / baby mama) you run into your ex Willow and *you have the audacity to ask to sit with her*.\n\n5) She tries to turn your request down gently but you refuse to take no for an answer when she tells you that\u2019s she\u2019s \u201calmost done\u201d and \u201cleaving soon\u201d. Because you have no shame and because you\u2019re too lazy / impatient to wait for your own table.\n\n6) You awkwardly sit down with her and she is glued to her phone (probably texting her friends about how insane it is that you think she would want to sit and have a meal with you and the girl you cheated on her with).\n\n7) Instead of taking the hint that your presence wasn\u2019t welcome and suggesting you two leave, your new girlfriend / former affair partner decides to take offense at Willow\u2019s *very justified* standoffishness and make a rude comment about her accent (meanwhile she herself has a strong regional accent).\n\n8) Willow points out this hypocrisy, which makes Emma even more angry. When she goes off about this to you later you make the fatal error / asshole move of comparing your current (and pregnant) girlfriend to your ex.\n\nI was gonna say that you must not like peace, but honestly ****you do not deserve peace.****", "YTA dude.\n\nYou never tell your pregnant partner that she will never be half of what your ex-partner was.

Willow is it? Because you forced 2 women who you know don't like each other to endure an awkward as he'll lunch, in which you invited yourself and gf to sit with Willow who had already tried to brush you off with the \"I'm almost done\" comment meaning Don't sit with me. You ignored that hint sat anyways and she proceeded to ignore you both because clearly she was uncomfortable.  Now your pregnant gf who was already feeling defensive since you forced this on her, made a snide comment and YOU DEFENDED YOUR EX  to the point of flat out telling your GF she DOESN'T MEASURE UP? I seriously hope she leaves you. YTA and a major one at that. I bet she is thinking of how you don't measure up to her ex and she wishes you could be more like him in certain aspects. Although I hope she will find a way better man with her next relationship.", "So you basically told your girlfriend you settled for a lesser woman? I get your annoyance at her accent jab towards your ex. Emma should have higher standards of civility. Her comment about \"winning\" you made you sound like a gawdy, overstuffed animal at a carnival. But your responses were way worse, petty and demeaning.\n\nIf I was Willow and you decided to invite yourself to my table and bring someone I didn't particularly care for, my meal would have ended immediately.

Your pregnant girlfriend obviously didn't want to be there, but you forced her to endure Willow's company. Your gf makes a snobby comment, which is wrong.

She was most likely on her phone because she didn\u2019t really want you sitting there and was avoiding being a third wheel. The only thing your gf needs to learn from your ex is to leave you alone. Her animosity towards your ex and feeling like \u201cshe won\u201d when you\u2019re clearly no prize clearly comes from you making her feel like she\u2019s in competition.", "Seriously?  If my partner told me \u201cI wasn\u2019t half as the woman his ex was\u201d, he would end up with my lunch on his face and my plate crAcked over his head.  And what do you want Emma to learn from your ex?  How to ignore you and look at her phone while you are trying to engage with her?  My guess is Willow dumped you and for some reason you took the opportunity of running into her, as a chance to make Emma jealous.  When Willow so obviously did everything she could to ignore your existence you thought comparing her to Emma, who evidently at least tolerates you, was a good idea.\n\nYTA with bells on.", "YTA get back with Willow. I hope your gf breaks up with you either way.", "Very fake but obv yta", "YTA and clearly still hung up on Willow. \n\nThis whole thing started because you cheated on Willow with Emma. Then, you were going to stay with Willow but someone told her about Emma and Willow dumped you. So Emma already feels like a consolation prize.

Then you forced your way into lunch with Willow when clearly neither woman wanted to sit together so you could \u201cprove\u201d to Willow that you are happy now with Emma damn it!\n\nYou managed to screw up your life and take Emma down with you.

One day on Discord, I said something and she disagreed with me, and sniped I may not be all that smart. I took it as a teasing, sarcastic-ish remark, and laughed at it. She can be kind of snipey, but you know, my kid needed assurances about her parentage, whatever. My ex-husband piped up and said that his wife was wrong and I am the smartest, most intelligent woman he had ever known, and that he would trust my information above anyone else he knew. \n\n\\*crickets\\*\n\nWell, I thanked him, as though the whole thing was a joke, and I suddenly found I had other things I needed to do that day, errands to run, hair to wash, something, anything to get off that Discord server.\n\nYou tell me: Was he the AH?

I mean, she speak perfect English except for her accent. Which is kind of a given considering it\u2019s her 3rd language.\n\nWhen we were waiting on our food, Willow was kind of rude, ignoring us, eating her food and being on her phone. I tried to start small talk. Willow replied briefly and it caused Emma to make a joke about Willows accent. Willow looked at her and said \u201cand look who\u2019s talking\u201d (Emma has a strong local accent).\n\nWhen Willow left, Emma started complaining about Willow, how she always pretends to be miss perfect but Emma won me and Willow doesn\u2019t even begin to compare.  This didn\u2019t sit right with me so I told her that I loved her but there\u2019s a lot she could learn from Willow and she\u2019s not half the woman that Willow is. \n\nThis cause Emma to go ballistic and she started crying, which happens a lot most likely due to pregnancy hormones, and screaming at me. I\u2019ve no idea what she said but I asked her to not make a scene. She wouldn\u2019t stop so we had to leave the restaurant without eating.\n\nShe\u2019s furious with me, saying I\u2019m the asshole but after what Emma said about Willow, I thought she needed a reality check. I love her to bits but she\u2019s not all that.\n\nShe complained to my sister and my sister called me telling me I was the asshole. Am I really though?
