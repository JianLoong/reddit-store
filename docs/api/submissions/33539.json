You aren\u2019t just angry at your family, you feel unimportant and you feel your new baby is unimportant to them and you have plenty of evidence for your emotions. I\u2019m glad you have your partners family, you\u2019re doing the right thing by just trying to maximise the joy of the season.", "NTA, but sadly, I think OP might be overestimating the effect going NC will have on her family. Not one of them showed up for you at your baby shower. They don't work around your schedule with a new baby.\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but they may be relieved. At the very least, don't expect them to notice for a long time.", "NTA and canceling things is the right move IMO because they need consequences. If they can't plan better (or stop lying and telling you things last minute), they don't get access to you and your family. If they can't stop putting your sibling first, they don't get access to your and your family. \n\nI would have one big talk with them about the pattern you see, how much it hurts you, and why you will be pulling back from them. I would also start making new Christmas traditions with your partner and child, and prioritize Christmas dinner with your partner's family. \n\nBasically put your energy where it's returned and not where it's unappreciated or disrespected.", "Cancelling events will do 1 of 2 things; 1) make your family realise they aren't seeing you as often and try to make up for Christmas 2) Nothing will change, they won't even notice and you can concentrate on being with people who do value your company.\n\nI hope you get 1 but be prepared for 2.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Cancel everything in the near future.  Your family showed you what they think of you, your family, and now your newborn with \"no one on my side of the family showed up and were all collectively out 'sick'\".  Believe your gut and not your family.   You can take stock of everything after some time passes when you can concentrate on yourself, your partner, and your child.  Keep every one of your family away from your child until they change, you don't want their crap around your kid growing up.", "Taking a step back when you are hurt is fine.  NTA.\n\nSpend time with partners family. Relax at home. Start your own traditions with your little family..", "NTA I didn't know what to vote for until you said they were too sick to go to your baby shower. Your priority is a stress free Christmas for your baby so spend it with her dad's family instead", "Info: what does your partner think is going on? Are they also certain your family doesn\u2019t care a lot about about you?", "Nta, listen number 2 , your parents don\u2019t seem to really care about you , anything your kids do will always be second to your sisters kids , including spouses doesn\u2019t matter what your family does they will always be number 2 ,  your parents are assholes but it is what it is", "NTA - Christmas is supposed to be a happy celebration, especially celebration of family. It sounds like your family doesn't celebrate you and yours, but expects you to join their celebrations for everyone else (including/especially sister). Yeah, no. Go celebrate with your spouse's family, who likely are happy to see you and your daughter any chance they can. Where they treat you like a valued member of the family and a human being in your own right.\n\nDo what makes *you* happy, and have a Merry Christmas.", "Someone may have already said this, but it sounds like your sibling doesn't want to share the grandparent thing. Do your parents have any other grandchildren besides sibling's, or is your new baby the first? I'm guessing sibling is making the major play to show who is boss here. \n\nNTA and I'd definitely be keeping my distance from the whole lot of them. Your parents aren't just excluding you, they are excluding one of their grandchildren. AHs", "I\u2019m sorry but Christmas is on the 25th.  That\u2019s the date.  You don\u2019t move it.  Your sibling isn\u2019t being the favorite by having Christmas Dinner  on Christmas.  Holding a birthday party on a different date is actually a common thing.  Rethink things.", "The Christmas dinner does not seem to be the issue here, so it's pretty difficult to give judgment.\n\nYou're acting as if your parents were just giving you excuses about the date instead of truly not having it planned out yet; if the relationship was already solid, you would probably be listening to those reasons. You are calling your sister a hypocrite because she is willing to move things for her own daughter, but not for you; if your relationship was solid, there's no way you'd accuse somebody of being a hypocrite for doing totally normal prioritization and avoiding a christmas baby feeling like they don't get a real birthday party. You've responded to a scheduling conflict by cancelling as much as you can with your family, basically saying that you're cutting them out over this incident, but a single scheduling conflict in an otherwise good relationship would not result in somebody cutting their family off. \n\nIts clear that these behaviors are all motivated by you feeling like your sister is given priority and you and your daughter are not, but we can't really judge that based on the information provided, but it would also be unfair to judge you as overreacting here because there's clearly more to the situation than this specific incident.", "NTA I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to cancel if you don\u2019t want to see them. I do feel I have to point out that if you are trying to get them to change by canceling or punish them\u2026well to be honest, it doesn\u2019t sound like they care whether they see you or not. I\u2019d do what you are planning, but with the mindset that I\u2019m doing it so that I don\u2019t have to see them. Not so that they\u2019ll want to see me. Because the latter? Might never happen .", "NTA. I think going low contact with your family for a while is a good plan. Resentment and hurt don\u2019t just come from one incident. It comes from years of feeling unimportant and less than. Embrace your own little family for now and reassess how you feel later. I think you will probably find that your family don\u2019t really even notice that you are backing away from them and that will tell you everything you need to know.", "NTA. Embrace the people who enjoy you and your family. Go low contact with those that don't work WITH you rather than do everything for someone else. Didn't even show up at the shower? Horrible.", "YTA - For thinking that were going to have it on a different day in the first place, and saying that the \"last minuted you\" by telling you at the b-day party, but come on you knew it was going to be on Christmas . Like I'm not sure why you even asked this or expected a different answer. They have set a precedent that they are going to have their dinner on Christmas, not Christmas eve, not the weekend before but on Christmas. \n\n I think that they are entitled to have their Christmas dinner on Christmas. I could see why they still want to do it on Christmas since your sibling does, because then they aren't all alone on Christmas while you are off with the in-laws. I don't think that you are taking how this would effect them on Christmas if they do that. It doesn't mean that you can't go over the night before (or whenever you see fit) to spend time with them and celebrate Christmas. I'm sorry but my brother alternately goes to his in-laws for Christmas and my sister and I still get together for my parent's whether he is there or not, and then we meet up with him and his family when they get back in town. So you're off doing your thing and getting Christmas dinner but expect your family not to have a Christmas dinner because you aren't there? One monkey don't stop no show bro. And apparently you get together semi regularly with them.  Like really is an additional dinner necessary. You can easily just meet at a restaurant or just at their home, and exchange gifts and enjoy each others company.", "Yes, YTA. It's possible your sibling is really the favorite and always gets his or her way, but if I'm honest your whole story makes you sound petty, immature and not very likeable. And your reaction is way over the top.\n\nIf you're old enough to have a kid of your own, maybe it's time to stop comparing the relationship each of you has with your parents and focus on making sure your own relationship with them is as good as it can be, regardless of whether they like your sibling better or not. Punishing them because you're not getting your way is NOT the way to achieve this.", "NTA.  Cancelling will start to send a message but if you really want hammer it in say no to any invites and then talk up the partners side of the family.  Petty but effective.", "NTA, stick with the people who value you.", "NTA.", "I was going to vote against you until I got to the bit about your baby shower.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, don't cancel because they'll shift the blame on you. Just don't show up anymore", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry your family treats you, and now your daughter, this way. But I\u2019m glad you have a supportive husband. And it sounds like his family have welcomed you into their family. \n\nI would honestly quit even trying with your family at this point. Spend every Christmas with your husband\u2019s family and create wonderful memories and traditions with your child with people that love and care about you. And as she gets older you can create Christmas traditions with her and your husband. \n\nAnd honestly I would cancel everything too and not make new plans moving forward. \n\nI hope you have a wonderful Christmas filled with laughter and joy.", "NTA and I would consider going no contact, sorry to say you are not important to them. They do not deserve you or your family. You are doing the right thing by cancelling on them but go further, they need consequences. Enjoy with your partners family and your very first Christmas with your daughter.", "NTA.

You state that your sister/family hates not having Christmas dinner on Christmas. So, presumably, it's almost always or ALWAYS on Christmas already? Which you knew and expected?
