Like another mommy. Fuck \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd26", "Right because those types of men don't pretend to be caring before they get married.", "That's awesome. Having that sort of understanding and empathy in a relationship is key IMO. Hope you're well, happy n healthy. \ud83d\ude0a", "a birthday is a special day thats SUPPOSED to be about you. sorry that you never experienced that. get well soon cathy", "I mean he\u2019s not gonna give specific years + days", "Are you a bot or just not coherent in conversation?", "No need to feel sorry for me, my life is great. I hope one day you learn to love yourself and create your own happiness without having to solely rely on others.", "It's either 3, 4 or 5. That's not hard math to subtract this year from the year of marriage."]}
