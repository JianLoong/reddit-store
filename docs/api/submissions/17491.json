Here\u2019s my stupid ex story. \n\nI love halloween, it\u2019s my favorite day of the year and I usually take off work to watch movies and eat candy and dress up. I never got to celebrate as a kid. When my ex and I were dating, every year I\u2019d beg him to take the day off with me but he never did. Then one year he agreed to, and we had a big day planned with my best friend. I reminded him for weeks to take the day off but he never did. I still had an incredible time with my best friend but I was really hurt and all my boyfriend could say was \u201cit\u2019s a waste of my PTO days.\u201d Even though he had taken an entire week off for the release of destiny 2. \n\nAnyways. I gave up on Halloween after that. So a few years ago, I re-entered school. I was working full time, had a side cleaning job, and was taking one class shy of full time credits. He decided that year, we needed to have a huge Halloween party at our house. \n\nI told him I didn\u2019t want to because I was too over worked to do any of the planning or work. I also had been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and was essentially dying but nobody noticed. I told him between everything I really didn\u2019t want to have a party. But he insisted he would do all of the work. \n\nHe didn\u2019t. He pawned half of it off on his mom, and another chunk of it off on my best friend. And the rest was still on me. He wasn\u2019t even home the entire day leading up to the party. My best friend and I did all of the decorating (the decorations were donated by his mom), I made all of the food. I assembled tables and chairs. I cleaned the entire house. He showed up after guests had already started arriving. \n\nTurns out everybody was in on his plan to propose that night which is why his mom and my best friend were so helpful in making things look nice and being there for me. He proposed in a really awful way. He took me out to the front yard said \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d I was stupid as hell and said yes even though I didn\u2019t want to. I was already thinking of ending things but everyone being there and all the work it was a lot of thoughts at once. \n\nAnyways. We broke up a few months later because at no point did he ever improve. It was a nightmare.", "This. I don't want to have to ask my partner to spend time with me (as in, drink a cup of coffee on the back porch with me in the morning) - I want to be with someone who wants to be with me. If you only do it when I ask, it's clear that you don't care one way or the other and I don't want that. Yet trying to explain this only leads to the \"I can't read your mind\" argument. It's why I'm single now and probably staying that way.", "Soon to be ex for sure", "Luckily, they are out of our lives!", "I am sorry.  That is why I now don't depend on anyone but myself to make my birthday a good one!", "Well played."]}
