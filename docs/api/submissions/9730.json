My daughter and Janie are inseparable. They\u2019re together every weekend. I also always thought that Janie\u2019s mom is responsible and a good mom. Janie is very smart, respectful, and her mom seems involved in her life. \n\nI\u2019ve always known that her mom works night shifts but I recently found out she works nights every other weekend and on those weekends, she and Janie have breakfast together then she gives Janie some money and tells her to \u201cget the hell out and not come back until 2-3pm\u201d (these were Janie\u2019s words) and that on those weekends, my daughter and Janie are wandering around town completely unsupervised (they\u2019ve alway made it sound like Janie\u2019s mom was with them). \n\nWhen I found out the girls have been lying to me, I grounded my daughter for 3 weeks then when her grounding was over I told her she\u2019s not allowed to hang out with Janie except at school or when I\u2019m supervising. My daughter thinks I\u2019m ruining her life and rarely spends time with Janie anymore because she doesn\u2019t want me \u201cbreathing down their necks\u201d. She also constantly whines about me not being cool like Janie\u2019s mom. \n\nJanie\u2019s mom has also called me to ask me to reconsider my decision. She agreed that the girls shouldn\u2019t have lied but she claims that she always knows where the girls are and what they\u2019re doing, which I seriously doubt. It sounds like she takes her 15 year old\u2019s word for what they\u2019re doing then goes to sleep for the rest of the day. \n\nI thought my husband was on my side but I had to go out of town last weekend and he allowed our daughter to sleep over at Janie\u2019s house the entire weekend without even running it by me. He even had her leave her phone at home (I have a tracker on her phone) so I wouldn\u2019t find out. We argued and he called me overbearing and paranoid. He\u2019s been sleeping in the guest room since the argument so I wanted to know if I was the asshole for not allowing my daughter to hang out with Janie unless they\u2019re being supervised.", "created_utc": 1676161644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1102e3l/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_her_best/", "score": 527, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you don't realize that your helicopter parenting is ruining both your relationship with your daughter who will in a couple years be a legal adult and will probably say \"screw this\" and leave and never come back, and your relationship with your husband.\n\nYou HAVE to teach your kids to be independent.

I totally figured this was gonna be that Janie's mom let them drink and smoke pot in the house or something or that she wasn't home and so the girls were having boys over and partying.

Your daughter could also sneak out while you're sleeping just as well at NIGHT. I'm sure her friends mom is much more alert and accustomed to being a light sleeper because of the dangers while you sleep soundly at night just assuming your daughter is home.

No. You know that in most states 16 is the driving age. Does she also have to be with an adult when she has a full license? Give her some room.\n\nYou know why she lied? Because she knew you'd act like this. You are fostering an environment where she will do things you don't approve of and lie about it.

What you have to understand is that a single-parent household operates **very** differently than a two-parent household, out of necessity. The kid(s) is raised to be more independent because they have to be more independent...yes, there are down sides to this, but there are also benefits.\n\nI was raised in a two-parent household, my parents were fairly strict, and most of my friends were in single-parent households. That restricted my ability to \"hang out\" with them a LOT. My friends and I were all good kids, but it did lead to me lying sometimes about circumstances so that I could hang out at friends' houses when parents weren't home. I didn't feel good about that, but all we were doing was watching TV or going to the mall. Never anything we weren't supposed to be doing.\n\nI ended up being a single parent myself, and that caused me to reflect a lot on what I experienced as a kid, what my friends experienced, and how I wanted to handle parenting. I realized that out of necessity, I **had** to trust my kids. I had some very basic but non-negotiable rules to ensure their safety, which I was clear about with them. They were tweens/early teens, they understood fully, and I never had a problem with them following those rules. As they got older, I began to understand that this was actually preparing them to make good decisions as adults. So I kept going with it...as they demonstrated ability and trustworthiness, they got more privileges and freedom. They're now in college and are making smart decisions. Also, my friends who were raised in single-parent households are all doing well for themselves.\n\nUnless your daughter is out causing trouble, there is no problem with her hanging out unsupervised during the day. Teach her to be aware, and I personally don't feel it's unreasonable to ask that she let you know where she is if she is out and about without an adult. That was one of the rules I had with my kids - not because I was overbearing, but because if something happened, we would know where to start looking (if you have to call the police and say \"my kid is missing\" it's way more helpful to say \"they were hanging out at Washington Park\" than \"I have no idea where my kid was\").

I was a trouble teen because of mental health, and it made my mum very, very overprotective. She NEVER went to the extremes you do. NEVER. But she would always want me to phone her during the day, she had access to my bank accounts, etc etc.\n\n\nWhen I was 18-21, I never told her anything. I had a suicide attempt, drinking issues the whole lot - she never knew. She thought I went into hospital because I was sick - not because I took all my meds at once. She flipped when I changed my bank account access, so she could no longer monitor my finances. Now, she never TOUCHED my finances - she simply occasionally, every few months, would pass comment on my spending. So yeah, miles away from your attitude, apparently, but even THAT was enough to drive a wedge between us. We fought ALL THE TIME. \n\n\nUntil, at age 22, I sat her down and told her that she HAD to let me make my own choices and mistakes. She HAD to let go of the overprotective role. She had to accept that I wasn't her little girl anymore. She tried to change.... But a lot of the overbearing behaviour was still present. \n\n\nUntil her mum (my gran) passed suddenly. My mum fell apart. I came in and planned funeral, held the family together, kept my older brothers organised and ensured they arrived in England on the right days. My mum was unable to handle the stress. My dad was unable to ha dle the stress. \n\nOur relationship changed just like that. I was no longer a little girl to my mum. I was a competent adult woman who had gone through a rough time and had stepped up and tried to mend things. I knew my mum was only trying to keep me safe. But it couldn't come at the expense of my own life experience. \n\n\nNow, my mum is more like a best friend. She phones me to vent her issues, I vent mine. She knows not to tell me how to sort stuff, unless I ask her. I'm now the one who basically 'handles' all the family drama from my two older brothers too. Talked one through a mental breakdown when my mum couldn't, encouraged the other to keep his head high and find the career. \n\n\nDO NOT let your relationship with your daughter go on like this.

Time moves on. You have to let go of that image. You must allow her the opportunities to make mistakes and learn from them. Yes, you should be there for her, but only as the safety net - not as the controlling party. One day very soon, she will be out in the world, living somewhere else. She HAS to gain the abilities to function responsibly BEFORE that. Or else she ends up like I was - unable to cope, potentially getting carried away with sudden freedom and no concept of responsibility, or even feeling so untethered that she ends up taking a self destructive route, like I did. As she is now, you're stopping her from gaining experience and learning. You're actively pushing her towards becoming a vulnerable adult. She will not have any way of understanding how to navigate the world. That will make her an easy target for horrible people. \n\n\nYou are doing her a disservice. You need to talk to her.
