His sister (22f) is a trans woman who came out about 4 years ago. I am a super girly girl, I have pink nails all the time and I style my hair and I\u2019m always wearing makeup and dresses.\nAnyways, my SIL is getting married in 2 weeks. Her fianc\u00e9e is a beautiful woman and they\u2019re a perfect match. Both of their style is very simple. Three weeks ago was their bridal shower. I wore a sage green slit dress, hair and makeup was super simple. When I got there, my SIL was very cold with me. Her fianc\u00e9e complimented me and thanked me for helping with the planning. SIL barely said anything. I figured she was nervous and just stressed out, she has social anxiety. The shower was wonderful and it looked like they had a great time.\nA week ago my SIL texts me, she asks me if I can send her what I was thinking to wear to the wedding. I send her a picture of the dress I bought. Then she asks if I would consider a jumpsuit. Not usually my style but I tell her I\u2019ll look into it. I send her a cute one I found on Amazon again. She says no. I ask her what is she thinking I should wear. She sends me a loose jumpsuit that doesn\u2019t even look appropriate for a wedding. (Background: I am a Latina who is only 5\u2019 tall. My waist is small, I have D size boobs, and a really big butt. When I was a kid my mom would put me in oversized clothes to hide my body and it gave me body dysmorphia and an ED). \nWhen I see the jumpsuit I realize that she wants me to not \u201cshow my body off.\u201d I hate it but I can compromise. I send her a dress that tbh is not flattering to my body type at all but it\u2019s still pretty and I can make it work. She rejects it then calls me to go off about how I\u2019m trying to upstage her at her own wedding. I told her I\u2019m trying to find a middle ground that doesn\u2019t require either of us being extremely uncomfortable. She and I argue a bit on what is appropriate until finally she says \u201cit\u2019s my day and I decide what goes.\u201d \nThen it clicked for me, she\u2019s right I can\u2019t argue with her about her day. So I tell her that I am not going to the be attending. She can set her boundaries and I either can follow them or not be in the situation. So that\u2019s what I choose. I will not be in a situation that is uncomfortable but I\u2019m not going to have her compromise for her own wedding.\nShe hangs up and calls my boyfriend crying to him. He\u2019s at work during all of this so he\u2019s confused. I send him the screenshots. He agrees that we were at a standoff so someone had to give. Now that he agreed with me, she has been crying to her family telling them how horrible I am for trying to always upstage her even at her wedding. Am I really the asshole? Should I apologize and wear the ugly romper?", "created_utc": 1683495148, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b3l9w/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_sils_wedding/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't go if that's how you're being treated.\n\n>Should I apologize and wear the ugly romper?\n\nNo. What next - a bag over your head?", "NTA it is super sad and surprising that any woman would be intolerant of someone else\u2019s body, but bridezillas gonna bridezilla, I guess.", "NTA\u2014you handled this with an enormous amount of grace\u2014it\u2019s too bad your SIL is dealing with insecurities surrounding her wedding, and that she can\u2019t be comfortable with a compromise, so not attending is frankly being kind and understanding. Just make it clear to your SO that he should still attend so it doesn\u2019t become a bigger thing than it already is.", "NTA. You don't have to wear anything you're uncomfortable with. I would recommend respectfully setting a boundary about what you are comfortable wearing. You could also offer to still attend, but not participate in any of the photos/bridesmaid activities if she doesn't want you there.", "NTA- You shouldn\u2019t have to suffer a traumatic and triggering experience for any reason at all. You absolutely shouldn\u2019t wear it or apologize. And if your SIL knows about your trauma relating to that, it\u2019s an insane stance for a trans woman to take considering how many of us deal with similar things. I think if you haven\u2019t said it, that could maybe resolve some things if you would be comfortable in saying it tho. I hope everything works out between you 2, but there\u2019s no need to apologize and you shouldn\u2019t wear the romper.", "Absolutely NTA. She is trying to assuage her insecurities by making you look bad. That\u2019s on her, but you don\u2019t need to accept her poor treatment. \n\nKeep those screenshots. Should the flying monkeys be sent, feel free to forward them.", "NTA - if your SIL is unable to enjoy her wedding because she\u2019s spending the entire time jealous of your looks, then that\u2019s on her. You took the high road and decided to give grace and not attend when she was trying to force you into a frumpy suit.", "Kinda disappointing that someone who must have a lot of experience of expressing herself in a way that's natural to her, and confronting prejudices over that, wants to have a wedding where you can't express yourself in a way that's natural to you (in a much more minor sense!).\n\nNTA - you offered plenty compromises, and being basically told you need to wear a potato sack is not reasonable.", "NTA. Her projection of insecurities are not your problem to cater to. You offered to compromise and she isn't willing to accept.", "NTA your SIL will probably always have insecurities when it comes to her image vs the image of a biological woman who has the features she wishes she was born with. I would think that someone who understands body discrimination would be less apt to try to force it on someone else. You do not have to accept being made uncomfortable to make her feel better about herself. I do feel for her. However, if her insecurities are so strong that she feels the need to police the image of others out of worry of being upstaged it is on her to seek therapy and learn to handle those insecurities in a mature and respectful manner.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't go to that AH's wedding. But apologize to her partner, and send her the texts.", "NTA. As long as an outfit is appropriate for the occasion, you should never feel required to alter your choice. You are not responsible for SIL\u2019s insecurity. She should seek therapy.", "NTA\n\nI actually commend you for trying to find a happy medium with her and forgoing your comfort for her. She didn't like it. Now if you wore the frumpy jumpsuit, everyone would talk about how you didn't respect the wedding and how you stood out. A simple dress would have been the best choice (It seems like you tried to find one). She doesn't get to dictate what you wear and you don't have to go if you aren't comfortable.", "NTA. You\u2019re not in the wedding, you\u2019re a guest. SIL has no say about what you wear.", "NTA. Your SIL is experiencing the consequences of her own actions. You made the most reasonable choice. You were never going to make her happy; this is the least asshole move possible.", "NTA. You tried to find a compromise. She's going to be upstaged by a lot of guests if she doesn't get her insecurities figured out.", "So is she policing the outfits of all the guests?\n\nI highly doubt the ugly romper will hide your assets. She'll just take issue with your hair and makeup or the fact that you walk too womanly.", "This is why I will never have a wedding. It brings out the worst.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You solved the issue by removing yourself. Now she won't get \"upstaged\" at her wedding."]}
