My husband of 20+ years is also a removing alcoholic so I am familiar.  Secondly according to daughter it needs to be put of house not just hidden in back of cupboard or fridge.

Agreeing to not consume alcohol is fine, but IMO this request is unreasonable.  \n\nIf her next BF\u2019s family expects you to cover your head and face, would you even consider it?

I would make sure these people know that you do have alcohol in your house because ultimately it's up to the person coming over to decide to not drink and if they are uncomfortable with the situation it is their responsibility to make sure that they dont put themselves in a compromising position. Your daughter is NTA for her request simply due to her age and inexperience with addicts and their toll on the lives of people around them but it is unrealistic to clear out all of your alcohol for someone that isn't actively your friend.", "NTA. That's a super unreasonable request regardless of the father's recovery status. If he isn't in a position where he can be in the same house with alcohol then it's his responsibility to not attend gatherings where he might be tempted. You should probably sit down and have a real talk with your daughter about reasonable boundaries and expectations because this seems like a solid teaching moment at a really healthy age for her to learn it.", "NTA why should you move your items for a guest who has no business in those areas of the house for a party.", "NTA. \n\nThat's a ridiculous ask.", "NTA.  Don't serve it obviously, but no need to hide it either.", "NTA.

Keep in mind that, if the person in recovery can't even be around baking alcohols, they may have enough of a problem that you should also consider locking up any alcohol-based cold medications and mouthwash you have in the house.

It's just a cool book lol). I also  sit respectfully during prayer when I am at their house, even though I'm not religious.

I'm by no means saying that the kids are lying about the dad's issues, but maybe they're blowing them out of proportion.

Consequently, your perception of the person in recovery is warped because you're thinking it's too good to be true.\n\nEveryone handles alcohol recovery differently and my dad is one of those people who avoids even restaurants that serve alcohol, but he has never asked me to hide my drinks cart nor has he broken into it. I don't imagine that he'd ever ask me to redecorate in order to visit.\n\nIf this request is truly being made by the adults and not the teenagers, they need to be made aware that your home is not going to be redecorated for their personal beliefs. Your family shouldn't be pretending to be people that you aren't, and I suspect this request is based upon their faith more than out of concern for the father's sobriety since you said he's been dry for years.

First, to me, that sounds more like a religious practice than a recovering addict one. Second, regardless of the reason, that's completely unreasonable. If the father can't trust himself not to search inside your home for boxes you may or may not have hidden with all your consumable alcohols, then that's probably not someone who should be invited over to your home.

Storing away the actual bottles, okay, but still over the top, imo. Removing them from the house? Hell no. I like the laundry room idea. A guest should have no reason to go in there, much less open a closet. And leave the vintage signs where they are. Your daughter is way out of line here, and I would talk to the bf's family.

Vanilla extract? This request is frankly absurd. If they can't handle it being in a cabinet then they can impose on someone else.\n\nEdit: Also why does this kid's entire extended family need to come over?
