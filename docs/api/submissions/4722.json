I would make sure these people know that you do have alcohol in your house because ultimately it's up to the person coming over to decide to not drink and if they are uncomfortable with the situation it is their responsibility to make sure that they dont put themselves in a compromising position. Your daughter is NTA for her request simply due to her age and inexperience with addicts and their toll on the lives of people around them but it is unrealistic to clear out all of your alcohol for someone that isn't actively your friend.", "NTA. That's a super unreasonable request regardless of the father's recovery status. If he isn't in a position where he can be in the same house with alcohol then it's his responsibility to not attend gatherings where he might be tempted. You should probably sit down and have a real talk with your daughter about reasonable boundaries and expectations because this seems like a solid teaching moment at a really healthy age for her to learn it.", "NTA why should you move your items for a guest who has no business in those areas of the house for a party.", "NTA. \n\nThat's a ridiculous ask.", "NTA.  Don't serve it obviously, but no need to hide it either.", "NTA.

Hell, they could be dating 5 years, it still ain't happening. \n\nEither the son is making up these demands willy-nilly, he's misconstruing what is being told him or the family has some serious control issues. \n\nNope.

Keep in mind that, if the person in recovery can't even be around baking alcohols, they may have enough of a problem that you should also consider locking up any alcohol-based cold medications and mouthwash you have in the house.

Everyone is different, of course, but that's not on you to accommodate. Asking for it to be hidden is one thing, demanding none of it be in the house at all is another. If his sobriety is still that tenuous after years, he still has some work to do on himself", "Adding: there should be no reason for the dad to be digging into your pantry, fridge or drawers, so you should be fine by just keeping alcohol out of public areas.\n\nHowever, this suggestion from your daughter probably didn't come out of nowhere.

I'm by no means saying that the kids are lying about the dad's issues, but maybe they're blowing them out of proportion.

Consequently, your perception of the person in recovery is warped because you're thinking it's too good to be true.\n\nEveryone handles alcohol recovery differently and my dad is one of those people who avoids even restaurants that serve alcohol, but he has never asked me to hide my drinks cart nor has he broken into it. I don't imagine that he'd ever ask me to redecorate in order to visit.\n\nIf this request is truly being made by the adults and not the teenagers, they need to be made aware that your home is not going to be redecorated for their personal beliefs. Your family shouldn't be pretending to be people that you aren't, and I suspect this request is based upon their faith more than out of concern for the father's sobriety since you said he's been dry for years.

First, to me, that sounds more like a religious practice than a recovering addict one. Second, regardless of the reason, that's completely unreasonable. If the father can't trust himself not to search inside your home for boxes you may or may not have hidden with all your consumable alcohols, then that's probably not someone who should be invited over to your home.

Depending on were someone is at with their recovery they might decide that the temptation isn't worth it for them", "Yes this is a great time for the daughter to get a lesson about how different families have different values and choices, and what are reasonable accommodations for guests.", "NTA. That's ridiculous. Was the father going to go searching through your kitchen for it?", "NTA simple solution is, if you gave one, put it in the car boot and lock the car, don't tell anyone else where it is.  Or just say no to hosting", "Pretty obviously NTA. What exactly is the assumption here?... That your daughter's boyfriend's father is such an unhinged alcoholic that he will burst through your door and immediately raid every single room and cupboard of your home in a frenzied search for anything with an alcohol content? This is deranged.", "Removing cookies wines and baking liquors sounds really odd. Is your daughter implying that he has no control where he\u2019s doing to start rummaging through your cabinets to find anything with alcohol content? Or are they so religious and nosy that the family would start snooping to see if their son\u2019s girlfriend is being raised in a \u201cworthy\u201d household by checking to see if they could find anything they deem as sinful? \n\nIf she\u2019s that concerned about it, then I\u2019d simply decline hosting and suggest meeting in neutral territory like a restaurant if she\u2019s so keen on getting everyone together. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I am sorry but guests don't get to dictate what you do in your own home.  Making accomodations for reasonable requests are fine.  Putting the booze out of site and not drinking in front of them should be more than adequate.\n\nIf they are concerned that the dad is going to start going through cabinets and drink what he can find, then he's not in recovery - he's a full-blown alcoholic and shouldn't be coming over.", "NTA.  I think making sure it's not on display should be fine.  You need to remove it, why?  Because the \"super religious\" dad can't control himself and will swill your cooking wine if he sees the bottle?", "NTA, but if this grown man as a dinner guest goes rooting through your kitchen cabinets and fridge, you have a bigger issue than having alcohol in the house, but it's simple enough to address immediately.   \nI think this is getting overthought on Reddit (shocker) and by your teenager. I think the dad, if described correctly, will be a reasonable house guest who won't turn into Otis the drunk from Andy Griffith just because he sees a bottle of cooking sherry. He's an alcoholic in recovery not a werewolf.", "... So his family including siblings and their SO's are coming over for the holidays to visit with the family over 2 teens dating. They're highly religious.... You do realize they expect your daughter to marry into the family by the time she turns 18 and start cranking out the babies, right? And they'll also expect her to completely conform to their beliefs and completely cut you out of her life if you do not also conform?\n\nAlso, many alcoholics (recovering or otherwise) can deal with Not buying alcohol or going into bars but it's a completely different story if there is alcohol where they live/stay. They may not be able to handle not indulging. My SO developed a peanut allergy in adulthood. It's started out fairly mild. They are able to walk thru the store and refrain from buying anything with peanuts but if I bring anything into the apartment they will convince themselves that it's OK and their allergy isn't *that* bad... so no peanut butter cups for me unless I scarf them in the car. And they do the same with liquor as in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlzoft/aitah_for_refusing_to_remover_alcohol_from_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I cannot have alcohol in the house unless I plan to drink it immediately because if I wait a decent amount of time(and I'll generally wait months to open a bottle) then it's *my* fault for taunting them with it and they \"just wanted to taste it\" every day until it's gone...\n\nNTA but I would recommend locking it all up in an out of the way location. I would also recommend not giving your daughter support to join a cult unless you're already a member.", "You can't give that heads up to the guests - the fact that he's an alcoholic really is his private information that doesn't need to spread or accommodated unless he personally shares and asks for the accommodation.  Asking him would suggest your daughter told you; so unless he gave her permission to share that information you would be violating his privacy.", "I think your daughter is asking too much if you if all alcohol related things have to disappear...NTA", "The cult has to check out the daughter's family before they have her drop out of school and start cranking out babies for god."]}
