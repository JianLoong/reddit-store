My husband of 20+ years is also a removing alcoholic so I am familiar.  Secondly according to daughter it needs to be put of house not just hidden in back of cupboard or fridge.  We live in a climate where it's often below 0 so putting in garage isn't an option for some stuff.  My personal drinks may consist of a case of beer 6 bottles of wine and a few bottles of liquor the problem is my older daughter made wine for her wedding I'm storing in laundry room closet that consists of many cases.

It's not a reasonable request for a guest to make.\n\nIf your daughter came up with it and was trying to be thoughtful in her role as a sort-of host, then I'd gently explain that it's a bit much. If it came from the BF's parents then boy howdy, that's some entitlement right there.", "NTA. if you hide it and she finds out, she's gonna be pissed you lied so i would avoid doing that. besides, what guest family is going to be rooting through your fridge and liquor cabinets?", "NTA.

Yes. Does it make you an asshole if you don\u2019t? No.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house. You're already being very understanding and accommodating by not drinking with them around.

It would reasonable to request you not have the alcohol out in the open. Asking you to remove it from your house and your fridge is unreasonable.

You shouldn't have to be expected to accommodate for your daughter's bf's family's sensibilities or addiction problems.\n\nYour house is not the only place in which they'll be exposed to alcohol, it's up to them to abstain from consuming it.\n\nAlso, if your daughter remarks upon the differences between yours and her bf's family and how they should be respected, well, she's right, they should be respected. Which means that if they come to your house, they must respect your home and how you run it and if you go to theirs, then you'll extend the same respect to their customs.", "INFO\n\nHide it why? Are you hiding it so the alcoholic doesn't open the pantry to grab a box of cereal, and come face to face with the cooking brandy?

Agreeing to not consume alcohol is fine, but IMO this request is unreasonable.  \n\nIf her next BF\u2019s family expects you to cover your head and face, would you even consider it?  Maybe the modern art is offensive, so hide that too?", "NTA. He has to learn how to deal with alcohol, not everyone else.\n\nWould he go to a restaurant and demand they hide all alcohol and don't serve any to other customers when he's there?

After 5 years of making sure that we hid everything and didn't drink to be supportive we are..tired of feeling like we have to walk on eggshells in our own home or that we cant casually enjoy a cocktail with other friends. I would make sure these people know that you do have alcohol in your house because ultimately it's up to the person coming over to decide to not drink and if they are uncomfortable with the situation it is their responsibility to make sure that they dont put themselves in a compromising position. Your daughter is NTA for her request simply due to her age and inexperience with addicts and their toll on the lives of people around them but it is unrealistic to clear out all of your alcohol for someone that isn't actively your friend.", "NTA. That's a super unreasonable request regardless of the father's recovery status. If he isn't in a position where he can be in the same house with alcohol then it's his responsibility to not attend gatherings where he might be tempted. You should probably sit down and have a real talk with your daughter about reasonable boundaries and expectations because this seems like a solid teaching moment at a really healthy age for her to learn it.", "NTA why should you move your items for a guest who has no business in those areas of the house for a party.", "NTA. \n\nThat's a ridiculous ask.", "NTA.  Don't serve it obviously, but no need to hide it either.", "NTA. How would she feel if you told her, \u201cIf they come over, they are REQUIRED to drink alcohol the whole evening\u201d because it\u2019s against your beliefs not to drink during the holidays?

Cancel the dinner altogether. \n\n>...but was now told I need to remove anything alcohol related.\n\nLet whomever is making these demands know that while you might have been willing to hide the brandy in the sideboard or the whiskey in the laundry room, asking you to remove parts of your d\u00e9cor is preposterous. \n\nI would not be willing to expel the effort it would take to remove all of the items in  my household that are alcohol related to  appease the family of a boy my daughter has been seeing for less than a year. Hell, they could be dating 5 years, it still ain't happening. \n\nEither the son is making up these demands willy-nilly, he's misconstruing what is being told him or the family has some serious control issues. \n\nNope.

Keep in mind that, if the person in recovery can't even be around baking alcohols, they may have enough of a problem that you should also consider locking up any alcohol-based cold medications and mouthwash you have in the house.

My family is religious and when they come over I will usually take down some of my art that would be BLATENTLY offensive to them, but I'm not about to remove every aspect of myself that they wouldn't approve of.

It's just a cool book lol). I also  sit respectfully during prayer when I am at their house, even though I'm not religious.

They would ransack your pantry and bathroom first.", "Recovering alcoholic here, and I would NEVER tell people they need to hide their alcohol - let alone remove it! - from their own house. That's ridiculous.\n\nI suspect this may be coming more from their religious angle. There are a lot of religious sects which can be... unreasonable (IMO) about what they demand OTHER people do. Reasonable accommodation is one thing, but what they are asking is not.\n\nYou are NTA.", "I'm a recovering alcoholic as well, and other than the first three or four months, when I was struggling mentally to stay sober, our home still has booze in it. Everyone is different, of course, but that's not on you to accommodate. Asking for it to be hidden is one thing, demanding none of it be in the house at all is another. If his sobriety is still that tenuous after years, he still has some work to do on himself", "Adding: there should be no reason for the dad to be digging into your pantry, fridge or drawers, so you should be fine by just keeping alcohol out of public areas.\n\nHowever, this suggestion from your daughter probably didn't come out of nowhere. Perhaps what you need to do is talk with her (and maybe the boyfriend), figure out why, and assure them you'll be careful and step in if the dad does anything that seems off.", "Based on this I think you need to speak with her BF's parents. I'm by no means saying that the kids are lying about the dad's issues, but maybe they're blowing them out of proportion. As the child of an alcoholic, I had to learn to \"deactivate\" my hypervigilance once he began his sobriety journey- you just never really believe that the battle is finally over, you know? Consequently, your perception of the person in recovery is warped because you're thinking it's too good to be true.\n\nEveryone handles alcohol recovery differently and my dad is one of those people who avoids even restaurants that serve alcohol, but he has never asked me to hide my drinks cart nor has he broken into it. I don't imagine that he'd ever ask me to redecorate in order to visit.\n\nIf this request is truly being made by the adults and not the teenagers, they need to be made aware that your home is not going to be redecorated for their personal beliefs. Your family shouldn't be pretending to be people that you aren't, and I suspect this request is based upon their faith more than out of concern for the father's sobriety since you said he's been dry for years. I know you've mentioned that your family has ties to their church somehow, but sometimes people will practice their faith differently in private rather than public so even if the church doesn't take the viewpoint of living entirely dry, the family may.", "I always forget that you can just buy alcohol with all your other groceries in the southern states.

I imagine that, as your daughter didn't mention any medications that would need to be put away, it's likely only items containing alcohol.\n\nOn another note, I noticed your update that you've been asked to either temporarily remove the alcohol from your home, or get rid of it entirely. First, to me, that sounds more like a religious practice than a recovering addict one. Second, regardless of the reason, that's completely unreasonable. If the father can't trust himself not to search inside your home for boxes you may or may not have hidden with all your consumable alcohols, then that's probably not someone who should be invited over to your home. And, if it's someone who is asking you to throw the alcohol out because it's against their religious beliefs, then, again, that's probably not someone who should be invited over to your home.", "Different people host differently.  They very well could have sodas in the fridge and tell the kids to help themselves, especially if the BF has been over in the past.\n\nWe don't know OP's house.  It could have an open bar shelf right in the living room or dining room.  Recovering alcoholics know to avoid liquor stores and bars to avoid temptation.

If OP refuses, then the father will minimize the temptation by NOT ATTENDING.\n\nThis is a 7-month high-school relationship, so we aren't talking about future in-laws at this point, but it's possible.
