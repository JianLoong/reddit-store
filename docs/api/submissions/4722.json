I would make sure these people know that you do have alcohol in your house because ultimately it's up to the person coming over to decide to not drink and if they are uncomfortable with the situation it is their responsibility to make sure that they dont put themselves in a compromising position. Your daughter is NTA for her request simply due to her age and inexperience with addicts and their toll on the lives of people around them but it is unrealistic to clear out all of your alcohol for someone that isn't actively your friend.", "NTA. That's a super unreasonable request regardless of the father's recovery status. If he isn't in a position where he can be in the same house with alcohol then it's his responsibility to not attend gatherings where he might be tempted.

Keep in mind that, if the person in recovery can't even be around baking alcohols, they may have enough of a problem that you should also consider locking up any alcohol-based cold medications and mouthwash you have in the house.

Everyone is different, of course, but that's not on you to accommodate. Asking for it to be hidden is one thing, demanding none of it be in the house at all is another. If his sobriety is still that tenuous after years, he still has some work to do on himself", "Adding: there should be no reason for the dad to be digging into your pantry, fridge or drawers, so you should be fine by just keeping alcohol out of public areas.\n\nHowever, this suggestion from your daughter probably didn't come out of nowhere.

I'm by no means saying that the kids are lying about the dad's issues, but maybe they're blowing them out of proportion.

Consequently, your perception of the person in recovery is warped because you're thinking it's too good to be true.\n\nEveryone handles alcohol recovery differently and my dad is one of those people who avoids even restaurants that serve alcohol, but he has never asked me to hide my drinks cart nor has he broken into it. I don't imagine that he'd ever ask me to redecorate in order to visit.\n\nIf this request is truly being made by the adults and not the teenagers, they need to be made aware that your home is not going to be redecorated for their personal beliefs. Your family shouldn't be pretending to be people that you aren't, and I suspect this request is based upon their faith more than out of concern for the father's sobriety since you said he's been dry for years.

First, to me, that sounds more like a religious practice than a recovering addict one. Second, regardless of the reason, that's completely unreasonable. If the father can't trust himself not to search inside your home for boxes you may or may not have hidden with all your consumable alcohols, then that's probably not someone who should be invited over to your home.

I feel they need to compromise here rather than just saying no outright.", "Yup, but if that happens, they need to tell the guests to leave, and don't let the doorknob hit ya where the good lord split ya.", "That's what gets me--does the daughter have so low an opinion of her boyfriend's dad that she thinks he can't be trusted not to hunt for booze at the first opportunity? The man probably goes day to day resisting the urge to stop by a liquor store or bar on the way home, I'm sure he can manage to not peep through her fridge.", "Then Dad is a creepy asshole who obviously isn't in recovery yet.", "Right but OP mentioned religion but not that the religion is anti-alcohol. For many alcoholics I know they simply ask for no alcohol in the food or mention they are early on recovery and that they ask for alcohol to be put out of sight.\n\nIt cannot be in the home is too far. Not addressing the religion issue separately is also problematic. Of this relationship is serious they must accept that her family does not share similar beliefs. They are highly controlling it seems.", "Sure, but even my religious Muslim friends won't refuse to enter a house just because there's alcohol in there. I know people who don't want to be in a vehicle *transporting* alcohol, but not being in the same house, as a guest, seems unlikely.", "I wonder if there\u2019s a \u201cmy parents will judge them and thus girlfriend more harshly\u201d angle as well. He doesn\u2019t want to go home to pressure to dump the girl with the sinner parents who have booze in their house.", "Her daughter wants it completely out of the house and thrown away. That\u2019s not reasonable for guests who will be there for a few hours max. \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be looking through her fridge or her cupboard, so they\u2019ll be fine.", "Really? I grew up in PA and it was so weird. State stores felt like an outpost of the Soviet Union and I never figured out how to buy beer.", "Yeah PA liquor laws are fucked. The state I grew up in didn't have alcohol in grocery stores either but at least you could buy beer, wine, liquor, and snacks/mixers in the same damn store...", "Nothing about the post says it needs to be thrown away, and \u201cout the house\u201d is almost certainly an exaggeration to mean \u201ca place it won\u2019t be found\u201d which is perfectly reasonable imo. \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t guests use the fridge / cupboards?", "Well around my way, it was State Store or beer distributor and now Sheetz and Wawa have beer caves...", "Another reason you got downvoted is because you come off as an insufferable know it all.", "Oh no \ud83e\udd7a some  random on Reddit thinks I\u2019m a know it all. How dare I share my opinion.", "Nothing wrong with sharing opinions, just don\u2019t get all weird and defensive when others have an opinion about your opinion.", "NTA I am an alcoholic. This is absolute nonsense lol! Just because I cannot drink doesn't give me the right to dictate what other people can do. The balls on some people are just so massive. Sounds like more recovery is needed for dear old dad. Also I never understood some religious peoples no alcohol thing. Jesus liked wine and parties lol.", "NTA but please have a conversation with your daughter explaining that dating someone does not mean she needs to bend over backwards to accommodate their family.  Learning early that having boundaries is important.", "NTA..No guest gets to dictate to a host ANYTHING. You tell your daughter this is our house, our rules and if the father is uncomfortable he does not have to come and you understand. As a side note how the heck does he go out to a restaurant since so many serve alcohol?", "NAH\n\nIt doesn't hurt for your daughter to ask(Informing could be seen as demanding but I'll give grace here since she's 16).\n\nA decent compromise is not have alcohol on display.  And maybe clear out fridge temporarily.  As I can see them MAYBE needing to grab something from your fridge.  But unless they are helping with the cooking, I'd say cupboards with food stuff does not need alcohol removed.\n\nJust my take.", "NTA, if this guy goes looking and hunting for the alcohol then he's not recovering very well. A guest should not be going through your cabinets.", "Uhhhhh lets see....Not no, but HELL NO. If someone accepts your hospitality and has a problem with the beverages in your home invite them to go back out the door they came in. NTA", "NTA - you\u2019re considerate not to drunk around them, but it\u2019s a silly to ask to remove it all.", "Nta, if the father is recovering from alcoholism he is the only one responsible for his control around alcohol. His issues do not dictate what you can or cannot do in your own home just as they don't in public. If he is going to lose his sobriety because alcohol exists in the house he was in a losing battle already and should speak to his sponsor and support people. \n\nI'd just say no to hosting. She can visit them if it's such a big deal or they can invite you to their home instead.", "This is an unreasonable request. In my opinion it\u2019s very rude of them to tell you that you need to remove it out of the house. Who does that? That\u2019s so rude to demand that of somewhere you\u2019re going to have a free meal at. This is straight weird. I have never heard of this in my life. Even if they are super religious they can\u2019t impart their religious views onto you in your house that\u2019s bogus And rude and sounds kind of entitled if they think that you would actually do that instead of just hiding it like a normal person and not drinking it when they\u2019re there. I would inform them that if they would like to still come over for dinner you will have it hidden from site and you will not be drinking any but if they want any more than that that\u2019s asking too much. They are guests they do not live at your house or get to dictate what you do in your house that\u2019s beyond being polite it would make you a push over.", "NTA- not putting bottles on the table\u2026 ok\u2026 removing from the house\u2026 no that\u2019s asking too much\u2026\nWhat if OP has a decent sized wine rack? Fully stocked bar?", "NTA. What entitled guest to ask. There is nothing wrong with alcohol.  There is a lot wrong with expecting others to cater to you religious preferences and addictions", "NTA. Why does it need to be taken out of the house? Are they going to go searching for it? That sounds bizarre.", "NTA. \n\nBeing respectful and not drinking in front of him and putting it out of sight is enough. If he goes searching, that\u2019s on him. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s your house and there has to be some respect given there as well.", "It's possible your daughter is exaggerating their stance.  Why don't you call them and ask if this is really what they want?  If it is, you can just decline to have them over, because this demand really is unreasonable.  NTA.", "Recovery isn\u2019t about everyone pretending alcohol doesn\u2019t exist NTA", "NTA any recovering alcoholic who can't even be in a house with liquor, is not a recovering alcoholic, they are still an alcoholic. And if the reason is because of their religion, then they can kick rocks. This is your home, and you are not required to change anything about it to have people over. Find out if the guests asked for it, or if it's something the kid said. Even religious people and alcoholics know that other people drink, and they can either accept it, or just not come. Don't do it.", "NTA\n\nKeeping it put away is a normal thing. Removing it from your Hine? Ummmm no\n\nIf the family is that over the top perhaps Dad needs to attend an AA meeting before showing up.", "NTA.\n\nNoones forcing them to come if they're that worried about alchohol existing within the premises.", "I wouldn\u2019t clear it out", "NTA my husband is a recovering alcoholic, and knows he has to deal with being around alcohol sometimes.", "NTA", "NTA. His sobriety is his problem. The world does not stop for him. Surely, he goes to restaurants that serve alcohol. Keep your booze. If he\u2019s in recovery, he should be able to ignore the bottles.", "NTA, and how exhausting. I\u2019d take a hard pass.", "NTA fuck that. It isn\u2019t your job to babysit full grown adults.", "NTA. Others don\u2019t get to dictate what you have in your home.", "Nta, but can't you just do this to be nice? You don't know how far into his recovery this man is. Or if seeing alcohol triggers some ptsd in the wife or children. I understand not wanting to go through the effort, but put good out into the world and just do this for your daughter.", "Nta", "NTA. Doesnt sound like hes recovering at all. Everybody doesnt cater for 1", "If this is some weird control issue and not a miscommunication especially once they asked to remove decor, I\u2019d also warn your daughter about getting too serious with the boy. This is just weird.", "Father's sobriety is father's responsibility.  We have friends in recovery.  I make it a point not to cook with alcohol when they are coming to dinner.  I make it a point to provide lots of tasty, fun non-alcoholic drinks.  But I don't hide anything.", "NTA. Putting it away and not drinking is enough l", "Put it out of sight in the cabinets or something? Sure.\nRemove it from the house? Fuck. Off.", "NTA, the real issue here is that they are guests who are making demands of your home through your child. Like that's the biggest issue here, they weren't adults who related to you that someone in their family had an alcohol problem and that alcohol should be hidden during their visit, they had your teenager relate to you that all of the alcohol in your house must be disposed of because they will come to your home.\n\nYou shouldn't host people who are coming at you with this kind of attitude. -other people have brought up the possibility that this was sourced either from your daughter trying to impress her boyfriend's family, or from the son misguidedly trying to gussy you up for his family. So perhaps you should dig into who the actual source of this is, but either way you shouldn't even hide your alcohol. If they have such an issue with the fact that you consume alcohol when they have made the choice not to, fuck them.", "NTA. It's an absurd demand. I wouldn't welcome these people into my home.", "Please invite your daughter to take a taste of cooking wine lol.", "NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s an absolutely ridiculous request.", "100 percent NTA.", "NTA \n\nIt's your house. You don't have to serve it, but getting rid of it is another story. Are they gonna go through your house while they are there?", "NTA. Not having a drink? Fine. But he can\u2019t expect everywhere he goes for the rest of his life to hide the alcohol from him", "NTA, he's not a recovering alcoholic if he can't stop himself from going through someone's cupboard to find literally anything with alcohol in it. He's just an alcoholic.", "NTA! Removing every drop of alcohol and any related items is beyond ridiculous. Is it possible that your daughter has been hearing about \"the evils of alcohol\" at boyfriend's house and is using this as a chance to \"save\" you? I'd talk with your daughter and the boyfriend's parents and try to figure out where these request are coming from. Good luck, OP!", "Yeah you absolutely need to cancel, your daughter is being entirely unreasonable and you need to handle her", "This whole thing is nuts.  How does the guy even step outside.  This is way to much.  We have a few bottles around and just to be nice I could put them away but I\u2019m not moving everything around just because.  And stay the heck out of my fridge when your a new guest in my house.", "Jeez if the kids aren\u2019t overreacting and the parent does have this bad of a problem I would not want them in my house at all", "Your response just didn't make sense to the comment you were replying to. It's not logical to say that \"having alcohol in their face may be too much\" when the person asked \"what's wrong with keeping it out of sight?\" Keeping it iut of sight by very nature means the alcohol *won't* be in their face.", "It sounds like this may be more about inflicting their religion on everyone, than keeping temptation away from the alcoholic.", "> They would ransack your pantry and bathroom first.\n\nThat's something to consider.  OP, make sure to hide any prescription drugs if they come over.", "Yeah this right here, if the only connection that is bringing these people to your house is your daughter and your daughter is making unreasonable requests, she's not mature enough to be inviting this many people over. And honestly that seems to be the case anyway, since she isn't hosting, I don't think someone should be inviting a whole family over when they're not the host", "INFO My question is did the guests request this, or is this something the daughter came up with thinking it would make the guests more comfortable,  cause to me it sounds like a very childish request.", "No, I understand, I used a poor choice of words and all these ppl decided to leech on to it like Flys on shit, no amount of correcting myself mattered cuz everyone decided form that one sentence that I was completely in the wrong in every way, and some decided to take it a step further and fling insults at me. This isn\u2019t directed to you Valkrhae, but although I also spend some of my free time on Reddit, those ppl are the ones who need to step away and get a fucking life.", "I would check if this is a legit request from the family, or just your daughter going overboard.", "I think is more the self-righteousness from former addicts turn religious \n\nThey look down at people and I guess they think drinking is a sin and if they even have alcohol in their house their are sinners", "Or perhaps she has experience with him finding it and drinking it because he's not really in recovery and still a full blown addict blaming others and the situation for their problems.", "Good point"]}
