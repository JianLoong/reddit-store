On the subject of unwanted pregnancy has she never heard of other forms of contraception? Theres the contraceptive pill or if she says that she would \"forget\" to take the pill every day theres the contraceptive implant which lasts for 3-5yrs although it is not quite as effective after the 3yrs, the mirena coil (IUD) which lasts for 5-8yrs before it has to be changed or contraceptive injections which are administered once every 6 months. So her saying she doesnt like the feeling of condoms is a cop out shes just an irresponsible little girl who doesnt want to take responsibility for getting pregnant again it will always be someone elses fault and problem for them to fix (paying for abortion). As for the deadbeat boyfriend hes not any better even if she doesnt want to take responsibility then he should be man enough and mature enough to actually talk to her about other forms of contraception. Me and my wife talked about this when my son was born and has  used the mirena coil and now has the implant, my son is 11yrs old and there has never been any pregnancy scares. They say that no contraception is 100% but nobody can say that anything is 100% effective they say 99.9% which is far better odds than being irresponsible and using nothing. OP if i were u i would have a private chat with ur mum about talkin to ur sister about various contraceptive options open to her. This would relieve the financial and emotional burden on ur family for her to get some sort of contraception before she ends up pregnant again and going through another abortion.", "NTA\u2026and omg has she heard of contraception??", "NTA.  \n\n\nIt's disrespectful, unhygienic and gross. You mother should know about this and seriously she should put her foot down when it comes to your sister and breeding habits.

The situation is far more complex than I could have imagined.)\n\nESH this is not your business and what you have done will cause more harm to your relationships than dirty sheets could ever cause. If you were really so concerned about hygiene then why are we hearing about her abortion? Instead of telling your mother, why not tell your sister to wash the sheets, or leave it up to her to deal with it? Ultimately it is not your responsibility to get involved. Your issues with your sister go far beyond her having sex on your parents bed, and seem to be more about her having sex in general. Should she check in with you to let you know every time she has used protection? From what I understand, she has two children and one abortion. She shouldn't be ashamed for having children. It is perfectly normal. The last thing she needs after having an abortion is judgement from her own family. The reasons women may need an abortion are complex and personal. That detail was not relevant to this story. You only told us in an attempt to score points against her, and that is cruel.\n\nYour sister was wrong to do that, and maybe you have other reasons not to like your sister. However from the way you talk about your sister and her abortion, going out of your way to tell your mother seems to come more from a place of bitterness or resentment, than a simple concern over hygeine.", "YTA Obviously not fond of your sister.

You have a great heart and if you choose to, you will make a terrific mother.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying OP should first discuss with the sister before going straight to his mom. I\u2019m not saying he is an asshole but he went wrong about it. I do feel like there is a lot of jealousy from OP\u2019s side and that is clouding his actions. Why are you so behind him?\n\nMom wouldn\u2019t go to bed where her daughter had sex cause if the daughter didn\u2019t tell her, it would be okay for OP to then tell his mom. It\u2019s all about dealing with it without communicating with the sister", "U could've just talked w her to change the sheets, literally 0 reason to create a big mess about it", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I can understand why you would be frustrated; especially if you are taking on responsibilities you did not ask for. It sounds to me like your relationship with your sister is on fragile grounds. If you do not get your own peace and space, your relationship with your sister may fall apart completely. I would try to keep as much distance as possible for the sake of yourself, your sister and your mothers relationships. I hope things get better. It sounds like you are doing your absolute best. \u2661 Maybe too much. X", "My God OP, I never thought she would have had so many procedures! I am so sorry for you and your mom!", "My full sympathies for you and your mother, OP. I also told that idiot off who called you TA. Clearly they don't care to understand.", "I can understand your feelings, however what were  you hoping to achieve my telling your Mum? You seem to have caused more grief and upset by your own righteousness. Why did you feel unable to say to you sister, that is not fair? Make sure you clean it up. \n\nInstead you chose to upset both your Mum and your sister. You did not need to cause extra drama in your household. That,IMHO, makes YTA.", "If it doesn't affect your life, leave it alone.  Tell your sister you think she messed up and why, but aren't you a little old to be a tattle tale?", "Sanitized? I say just burn the damn thing!", "Apparently not, since she kills unwanted children.", "But that's shaming her though /s", "Yep. My partner and I had to sleep in my parents bed once when there was a leak in the spare room at their holiday home while we were staying there alone, and we changed the sheets before and after we slept there - and we just SLEPT. It felt really weird, I nearly slept on the couch and there is no way I'd have even thought about having sex.", "Idk she could just take the pill or be on the pill\nAnd it didn\u2019t work", "Don't apologize for that. They struggled to put 2 and 2 together and realize that you're calling her irresponsible, not her getting an abortion. That's their problem. Don't apologize.", "So, if you don\u2019t take care of your actual child you are irresponsible to have an abortion?", "Ain't that the truth.", "TBH parent or not I would like to know if somebody had sex in my bed for hygienic reasons.  \n\n\nIt's simply gross.", "My oldest niece who is still a kid is constantly in my mother\u2019s room watching tv, playing around and sleeps in her room either when my mother is or isn\u2019t home. Especially when my sister\u2019s boyfriend stays over. So my mother wouldn\u2019t know if my sister is in her room having sex in her bed.", "That's totally different...it's not anyone's bed. But this is the mother's bed. She goes to sleep in it every night. Having sex in her bed is so disrespectful and rude, especially not cleaning it", "They had no intention of changing the sheets as they went back into my sister\u2019s room after getting caught. I even went as far as changing the sheets myself just for her to put the same sheets back on the bed.", "Thank you and this one thing of me \u201charming\u201d my relationship with my sister can\u2019t measure up to the countless things me and my mother done for her. So to turn around and do something like that is disrespectful", "Initially I took the sheets and cover off when my mother wasn\u2019t home. Just for my sister to turn around and put the same exact sheets and cover back on the bed right after. As well as laying her oldest child in that bed to sleep. My first reaction was not to tell it was to yell but I had to finish preparing for work and didn\u2019t want to wake the kids.", "I was more worried about the disrespect of my sister. I tired to forget about it and would have but she put the sheets right back on the bed after I took them off.", "Or throw it off of the balcony of a castle", "Well given she\u2019s had one kid this year and an abortion it\u2019s either really not working or she\u2019s confused her bc pills with a bag of skittles.", "I'd argue that if you already have two kids and are financially dependent on your mother then your situation is already so dire that it's irresponsible not to use condoms *and* hormonal birth control.", "If you have multiple unplanned pregnancies while having living children you also don\u2019t take care of, yes, you are irresponsible. Accidents happen. But if it keeps happening, it\u2019s not an accident", "For me it's the fact that she's having obvious unprotected sex knowing she has another kid or kids she already doesn't take care of. \n\n\nIt's NOT about the abortion it's the situation!
