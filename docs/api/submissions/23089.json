{"id": 23089, "submission_id": "15977yy", "title": "AITA for calling my friend unreasonable for refusing to shake someone\u2019s hand?", "selftext": "I (14 M) have had a friend (13 F) and have been friends with her for 4 and a half years. we have been very close but recently she became Christian, which is perfectly fine. I\u2019m not religious but I try to respect her beliefs as much as possible. \n\nHowever recently things have been getting slightly out of hand. One of our friends suggested she play Hermione in the upcoming Harry Potter series thingy and she snapped back and said \u201cNo. I\u2019m forbidden from participating in anything associated with witchcraft. I won\u2019t. I cant\u201d (etc) our friend was quite taken back apologised and tried to explain that she just wanted to compliment her and she didn\u2019t speak to that friend for about 2 weeks. \n\nA month ago or so there was a ceremony assembly in our school where the principal would present the student with a certificate (debate team, sports, etc), the student would shake her hand and they would walk off stage. \n\nMy friend was called up stage and when she approached the principal she started bursting into tears and refused to shake her hand. she ran off so I went to comfort her. \n\nShe explained that it was a \u201csinful and shameful\u201d to shake the hand of another girl and went on about how she didn\u2019t want to be perceived as gay (more specifically lesbian) etc. \n\nI felt sort of uncomfortable because I\u2019m gay and have mild religious trauma from Christian\u2019s making me feel ashamed of being gay and generally feeling alienated by the church. I\u2019m also not accepted by my dad, his family, a majority of my friends, etc. I then said \u201cfirst, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay, even if you\u2019re not. Second, shaking her hand is just being polite, it won\u2019t turn you gay; you\u2019re being really unreasonable.\u201d I wasn\u2019t trying to lecture her or anything, just trying to reassure her obviously. \n\nThen she stood up, pointed at me and said \u201cI REBUKE THEE SATAN! Please save my friend from these homosexual desires!!\u201d While sobbing. She then ran outside and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since; a couple of our friends have too. I feel awful and want to support her and respect her boundaries as much as possible. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: to clarify she knew I was gay before but since becoming Christian got really uncomfortable every time I brought it up, so I just stopped, which looking back I shouldn\u2019t have compromised such a huge part of myself and my identity for her comfort but it definitely still makes me feel like an asshole sometimes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1690288373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15977yy/aita_for_calling_my_friend_unreasonable_for/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Both of you were in the wrong.\n\nHer homophobia is obviously very hurtful and offensive, and I hope that as she gets older she learns better. I'm really sorry that you've been badly hurt by your experiences with religious people (I do hope that you learn as you get older to differentiate between religion and the people who practise it . . . often the hatred lies far more with the latter than the former), and that this was upsetting to you, and I absolutely understand why this would have upset you. It was wrong of her to wield religion in a manner that spread hatefulness.\n\nBut you're also an AH here for calling her \"unreasonable\" for not wanting to shake hands. There are many, many legitimate reasons why people choose not to shake hands with others, including valid religious reasons in multiple faiths, and it's not for you to determine whether that is \"reasonable\" or not. Also, bodily consent is really important; someone else not wanting to be touched for ANY reason isn't something you get to decide is \"unreasonable\". That's just not up to you. You don't need to understand it, but you do need to respect it.", "NTA. She's dumb as fuck", "NTA\n\nYou were kind and encouraging, and she threw it back in your face by dehumanizing you. It sounds like her worldview has become completely overtaken by religious extremism. It really sounds like she's torn given her emotions in all of this. She might be going through some repressed feelings of her own. I mean, you're gay too. You know being gay isn't a switch that you can just turn on and off like Christians want you to believe. You can try and continue being a good friend to her to hopefully try and convert her back to sanity, or at the very least an accepting Christian.

She could have just politely declined playing a game about witchcraft. And she could have politely declined shaking the principal's hands and say it makes her uncomfortable to do so. Her beliefs are pretty bizarre because most Christians do not condemn shaking hands with the same gender.\n\nRegardless, she needs to learn to respect you and who you are. Her religion does not allow her to be a rude and awful person to everyone around her. You should be the one mad at her rather than the other way around.", "NTA. I agree with you.\n\nYour friend's belief is bizarre and I have to wonder if it's because of some repressed homosexuality.

Is there a school counsellor?\n\nAs to the conversation you had with her afterwards, you spoke to her very kindly, clearly, and openly, and she reacted very poorly. You did nothing wrong. It is up to you whether you wish to keep the doors open on this friendship, and up to her too. But if you find her calling you Satan unreasonable, offensive, and/or upsetting, you may want to protect yourself by keeping away.  Just because she\u2019s sobbing doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right.

For your own mental health I would learn to cut out people that are not good for you. Someone can be a decent person and it still not work out for you to be friends and that is okay. She\u2019s a teen so maybe she will grow out of the stupidity but you should find friends who are not as much work.

Does she already go to a therapist? Have any traumatic events happened to her recently? I've never EVER heard of a Christian being unwilling to shake someone's hand. Thats nonsense. However, some of the other beliefs are true even though the way she handled it is completely irrational and insensitive. It is true that Christians stay away from magic/witchcraft/etc but thats typically referring to real witchcraft (wicca) and satanists who actually worship the devil (because not all satanists do). However, alot of Christians don't like fake magic either for the same reason because you're imitating something bad (like dressing up as a devil for halloween, etc.). As for the topic of sexuality, there's nothing prohibiting her from being your friend. While it would technically be a sin for her to be homosexual, lots of people choose to purposefully live in sin (how many people are having premarital sex, regardless of sexuality, for example? Thats a huge no no in the Bible yet MANY Christians still do it). Many Christians choose to live in sin, even though they shouldn't. Keep in mind though, even though we choose to hold these beliefs, we are NOT supposed to judge or condemn anyone, but love them as they are and (if they are willing) share the gospel. You are supposed to be friends with non-Christians, just as Jesus was. The only major restriction is you are supposed to marry in the same faith - but thats spouses not friends. So yes, while a few of her beliefs are Biblically accurate, her actions were extremely irrational and she likely needs clinical help. There must be something else going on in her life.

Back then, this kind of messaging was usually coming from families and churches- kids by and large weren't saying these things out of nowhere with no adult coaching or pressure. Kids weren't organizing book burnings of \"satanic\" potter books; that was the adults in their community. \n\nThe fact that this seems to be coming out of nowhere from your friend, and she doesn't have a fundie christian family or church is even more concerning than if she did. It would still be bad if her family or church was the source of it, but it's weirder and more disturbing that they don't seem to share this extreme attitude. I wonder where this is coming from? \n\nNothing you said to your friend was asshole-like or out of line. I think you're right to be concerned about her.

This is about the age where kids are discovering themselves and more often than not they try to make small things like religion or sexuality their whole personality but it's still not healthy how far she's taking this.

I consider these behaviours as child abuse. Your friend need help but it can't come from you. \nI suggest to take some distance, it's sad for sure but better protect yourself. You are young and will find other friends...\nYou will only suffer from this.\n\n(NTA of course, good luck buddy)", "NTA she was unreasonable. Doesn\u2019t sound like this friendship is going to last.", "She sounds like she is descending into religious mania. None of her reactions are normal. Maybe speak to a guidance counselor and say you are concerned about her. You are NTA at all.", "No fucking way this is real lmfao", "Or an exorcism...  what ever entered her, its definitly NOT jesus....", "[removed]", "It sounds like you're fine without him and his new beliefs. Let her go be whatever you are - NTA", "I mean, the OG cult of orthodox Judaism bans men from touching women other than their wife, mother, and children. I had an orthodox client once and he refused to shake my hand in a business context.", "In Catholic mass you shake the hand of everyone around you, male or female. This is some weird self-repression thing I think.", "Thank you. I was losing my mind at all the comments treating this like it's real. YTA.", "I must disagree here. There's nothing wrong with him telling her she's being unreasonable. It's his opinion and he is well within his right to state his opinion. She is also the AH for throwing her religion around like it's a basketball in a pickup.game.", "> There are many, many legitimate reasons why people choose not to shake hands with others\n\nThis is both true and completely irrelevant, because we know the reason, and it\u2019s not a legitimate one\u2014it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m afraid that shaking hands will cause me to become gay\u201d. That\u2019s just straight-up homophobia. This is not ESH, it is NTA. The friend is a homophobe.", "Christianity is the extension of Judaism. Judaism promises that God would send the messiah, and Christianity is the fulfillment of that promise (through Jesus). People who only practice Judaism still think a different messiah is coming - they reject Jesus and think he was a false figure. Regardless, Christians still practice the Old Testament as well. Tldr - no it wasn't stolen; its a continuation", "That\u2019s crazy. You need some new friends if you don\u2019t want to be in the drama.", "Dear lord this scares me\n\nFirstly I'm really sorry members of the church have made you feel bad about who you are, they clearly are not very good Christians who should really ask themselves if they are setting the same example as Jesus. Please believe me when I say we are not all like these idiots and everyone should love you just they way you are\n\nSecondly, your friend sounds like she is seriously going through somthing, could be trauma related, puberty causing hormones to get out of wack, mental health or identity crisis. If you can maybe reach out to a trusted adult and share your concerns \n\nPs if she thinks Harry Potter is bad she would have a fit at this Christian's bookshelf \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Wait what\n\nIs this OP on another account", "She\u2019s definitely still gay.", "What do you know about her family life?\nI'm asking because this is screaming to me \"conversion therapy\" but I'm really hoping that's not it.", "Oh damn, did her parents send her to one of those camps that beats, and molest the gay out of them? Poor girl.", "You're NTA, but with this info I'm worried about your friend. This sounds like a trauma response on her part and I really hope she wasn't sent to conversion \"therapy\". If she was queer, she still is, and repressing it like this is only going to hurt her. \n\nI hope you can find ways to let her know that you can be there if she needs support to heal from all of this, but that you aren't going to stand for being mistreated for being yourself. You deserve to be treated with respect, and her fears aren't an excuse to treat you badly", "That doesn't make sense. Normally you'll see intense conversions like this because of family pressure. Which makes me think she's struggling a lot internally. She's grabbing onto something tha clearly defines right and wrong (not saying they're right), because she's having a hard time discerning that for herself which is understandable at 13. \n\nAll I can recommend is give her time, space, and a little grace. Becoming a teenager is rough and some people go through phases of adopting different \"identities,\" for lack of better term, to sort of help suss out who they are.\n\nIf you think she's in trouble or having some sort of break down, I would speak to her parents or another trusted adult. If she needs help, they're the ones that can get it to her. Otherwise, just be patient and let her know you're still here should she need you.", "That\u2019s not Christian. That\u2019s crazy. You need some new friends if you don\u2019t want to be in the drama.", "\u201cSlaves, obey your earthly master with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ\u201d \n\nJudaism is only 3500 years old. To presume any almighty being would limit its knowledge to something as fallable as human hands is hubris. If there is a god it does not care for any of our religions. Don\u2019t waste your life following rules written by long dead slave masters.", "Her religion does not allow her to be a rude and awful person to everyone around her. You should be the one mad at her rather than the other way around.", "This was my thought the absolute second OP mentioned friend IDed as gay prior to the religious conversion.", "There's a lot to unpack here. First, the slavery quote. It is a repeated theme throughout the Bible that slavery is wrong BUT if you find yourself in the position of slavery, yes you are supposed to obey. You do realize the Israelites were told to obey their masters for a LONG time while they waited in bondage until Moses was sent and God liberated them from the Egyptians? There are a LOT of stories in the Bible about what to do if you find yourself in evil situations. As for American slavery, you do realize that most abolitionists were Christian, yes? That Christian theology was the justification to garner support for the abolitionist movement? As for the second half of your comment, you're free to believe what you'd like. However, you should do more research on the subject. You do realize that the document from ancient times with the most number of manuscript copies by far is the Gospel, yes? Thats arachaeological fact, regardless of whether you believe what the manuscripts tell you. So you'll believe a bunch of other ancient historical knowledge with far less documentation, but ignore the best available source told from multiple perspectives? This is meant to be food for thought, Im not trying to start an argument. You can ignore it or think about it more. Completely up to you."]}
