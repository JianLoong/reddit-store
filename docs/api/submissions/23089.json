{"id": 23089, "submission_id": "15977yy", "title": "AITA for calling my friend unreasonable for refusing to shake someone\u2019s hand?", "selftext": "I (14 M) have had a friend (13 F) and have been friends with her for 4 and a half years. we have been very close but recently she became Christian, which is perfectly fine. I\u2019m not religious but I try to respect her beliefs as much as possible. \n\nHowever recently things have been getting slightly out of hand. One of our friends suggested she play Hermione in the upcoming Harry Potter series thingy and she snapped back and said \u201cNo. I\u2019m forbidden from participating in anything associated with witchcraft. I won\u2019t. I cant\u201d (etc) our friend was quite taken back apologised and tried to explain that she just wanted to compliment her and she didn\u2019t speak to that friend for about 2 weeks. \n\nA month ago or so there was a ceremony assembly in our school where the principal would present the student with a certificate (debate team, sports, etc), the student would shake her hand and they would walk off stage. \n\nMy friend was called up stage and when she approached the principal she started bursting into tears and refused to shake her hand. she ran off so I went to comfort her. \n\nShe explained that it was a \u201csinful and shameful\u201d to shake the hand of another girl and went on about how she didn\u2019t want to be perceived as gay (more specifically lesbian) etc. \n\nI felt sort of uncomfortable because I\u2019m gay and have mild religious trauma from Christian\u2019s making me feel ashamed of being gay and generally feeling alienated by the church. I\u2019m also not accepted by my dad, his family, a majority of my friends, etc. I then said \u201cfirst, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay, even if you\u2019re not. Second, shaking her hand is just being polite, it won\u2019t turn you gay; you\u2019re being really unreasonable.\u201d I wasn\u2019t trying to lecture her or anything, just trying to reassure her obviously. \n\nThen she stood up, pointed at me and said \u201cI REBUKE THEE SATAN! Please save my friend from these homosexual desires!!\u201d While sobbing. She then ran outside and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since; a couple of our friends have too. I feel awful and want to support her and respect her boundaries as much as possible. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: to clarify she knew I was gay before but since becoming Christian got really uncomfortable every time I brought it up, so I just stopped, which looking back I shouldn\u2019t have compromised such a huge part of myself and my identity for her comfort but it definitely still makes me feel like an asshole sometimes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1690288373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15977yy/aita_for_calling_my_friend_unreasonable_for/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately, your friend got caught up in some fundamentalist movement which has nothing to do with Christianity. Your friend is still gay, she didn't 'become' Christian, she just got pulled into a new cult. You may not be able to maintain this friendship.  You cannot reason with people who are pulled into her mindset. You're best off finding new friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW, the bar for being a Chrisitan is pretty low. You believe Jesus is the Son of God? Bam! You're a Christian!  As to whether you're a good person or not is a completely different question and has nothing to do with your religious beliefs. You may not be able to maintain thei", "I'd be querying where she got these beliefs from. Sounds almost like a cult have got their hooks into her.", "NTA\n\nnot a christian here but imo she was out of line by the last line 100%. You shouldn't feel bad or anything for it, you tried to respect her beliefs but it sounds like she's in deep and you won't be able to change her mind...even if it makes the friendship harder and with her outright disrespecting you as a friend for being gay.  \nMaybe check in with her? i'm not religious but it seems there's def something happening as i've never heard that being in physical contact with the same gender turns someone homosexual.", "Sounds like you are better off without her and her new found beliefs.  Let her go be whatever it is she has become you continue to be you- NTA", "NTA she has problems she needs to deal with and it will only harm your mental health. take this friendship at the loss because this sounds especially draining with your added trauma (also from a fellow lgbtq member, you are loved)", "I kind of lost credulity at the \"I rebuke thee\" part.", "You're very young, so I don't like calling you an AH, but since you requested judgement, here it is:\n\nESH. Both of you were in the wrong.\n\nHer homophobia is obviously very hurtful and offensive, and I hope that as she gets older she learns better. I'm really sorry that you've been badly hurt by your experiences with religious people (I do hope that you learn as you get older to differentiate between religion and the people who practise it . . . often the hatred lies far more with the latter than the former), and that this was upsetting to you, and I absolutely understand why this would have upset you. It was wrong of her to wield religion in a manner that spread hatefulness.\n\nBut you're also an AH here for calling her \"unreasonable\" for not wanting to shake hands. There are many, many legitimate reasons why people choose not to shake hands with others, including valid religious reasons in multiple faiths, and it's not for you to determine whether that is \"reasonable\" or not. Also, bodily consent is really important; someone else not wanting to be touched for ANY reason isn't something you get to decide is \"unreasonable\". That's just not up to you. You don't need to understand it, but you do need to respect it.", "NTA. She's dumb as fuck", "NTA\n\nYou were kind and encouraging, and she threw it back in your face by dehumanizing you. It sounds like her worldview has become completely overtaken by religious extremism. It really sounds like she's torn given her emotions in all of this. She might be going through some repressed feelings of her own. I mean, you're gay too. You know being gay isn't a switch that you can just turn on and off like Christians want you to believe. You can try and continue being a good friend to her to hopefully try and convert her back to sanity, or at the very least an accepting Christian. If she continues to use dehumanizing language with you, then it might just be time to move on with your life and drop her as a friend for your own mental health.", "NTA she needs help for her very clear mental health issues", "NTA. you tried your best to support your friend but it looks like she's going through something, whether it's a genuine desire to follow her new religion or an excuse to be homophobic, and that's not fair to you. she shouldn't be using her religion as an excuse to be disrespectful or rude towards others, and it sounds like you handled the situation with a lot of respect and sensitivity.", "NTA this goes beyond just \u201cbecoming a Christian.\u201d She\u2019s either in some whackadoodle cult or she has mental health issues. Or both. I would be nice if you could try and still be a support to her in case she wakes up and snaps out of it but I also wouldn\u2019t fault you for wanting to cut ties and not deal with her crazy.", "NTA - I am a Christian and these are weird things your friend is doing. I don't know where she is learning her faith from but it's not the Bible.\n\nYour friend needs help. Probably counselling to help her understand her confusion.", "NTA. Sorry this is happening to you. Teenagers are weird.", "NTA!\n\nIm so sorry your friend is behaving like this.\n\nThis behavior doesnt sound Christian. This sounds like hardcore extremism and cult like.  I know a lot of christians and i can honestly say, none of them have a problem with shaking the hand of someone of the same gender. They do not view it as a sin or shameful. This is extreme religious conditioning.", "Yeahhhhh she got into some nasty cult it seems", "Nta, this isn\u2019t normal behaviour for a run of the mill Christian either she\u2019s joined a full on cult branch of Christianity or this is an expression of a ton of internalised homophobia. Probably both", "She needs a psych eval. These are signs of a mental health problem. Many of which develop around puberty", "NTA. She could have just politely declined playing a game about witchcraft. And she could have politely declined shaking the principal's hands and say it makes her uncomfortable to do so. Her beliefs are pretty bizarre because most Christians do not condemn shaking hands with the same gender.\n\nRegardless, she needs to learn to respect you and who you are. Her religion does not allow her to be a rude and awful person to everyone around her. You should be the one mad at her rather than the other way around.", "NTA. I agree with you.\n\nYour friend's belief is bizarre and I have to wonder if it's because of some repressed homosexuality. A handshake is about as strong a \"friendzone-only\" gesture as there is.", "NTA, because refusing to shake the principal\u2019s hand when on stage to receive a certificate is unreasonable, and I hope that the school follows up on her behaviour, because it is extreme and irrational and should be a cause for concern. Is there a school counsellor?\n\nAs to the conversation you had with her afterwards, you spoke to her very kindly, clearly, and openly, and she reacted very poorly. You did nothing wrong. It is up to you whether you wish to keep the doors open on this friendship, and up to her too. But if you find her calling you Satan unreasonable, offensive, and/or upsetting, you may want to protect yourself by keeping away.  Just because she\u2019s sobbing doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s right. These aren\u2019t boundaries, she\u2019s just repeating bigotries and homophobia. \n\nQuestion: Is she gay?", "I call fake anti Christian cringe bait", "NTA\u2014your friend sucks and so does any religion that would encourage her to think and act this way.\n\nSide note to nip this in the bud: not interested in hearing about #NotAllChristians. This is a toxic ideology that follows your faith wherever it goes around the globe. If you\u2019re not fond of that association, you need to work it out with your co-religionists.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
