They've been dating for around six years and my brother has told me that they've discussed marriage and kids but were waiting for him to finish his master's degree.\n\nAround a year ago his gf called me for some advice. She told me that she was pregnant but didn't think that she wanted to have the baby. She wanted my opinion on how he would take it as they have discussed having kids. We're both pro-choice but that said my brother was super supportive when I had my daughter (F3, her dad split before she was born). He has been a great uncle, always talking about how he can't wait to have kids of his own, etc. I told her that it could be a deal-breaker for him but she had to tell him to find out. She said she would be telling him and also asked that I keep it to myself.  He never brought it up with me and there was no baby so I assumed he was working it through on his own (he's like that sometimes).\n\nMy brother asked for help picking out a ring and I offered to let him use our great-grandmother's ring to propose (it was left to me). We agreed he would come for a visit to pick it up just before he's going to ask her.\n\nHe came over last weekend to pick it up. He arranged for some of my friends to take me out for a girls' night and he babysat giving me a much needed break as a small thank you. When I got home I was feeling sentimental so I started tell him how happy our Nana would have been that he's getting married, how he's going to be a great dad and how proud of him I am that they were able to move past their trouble in the last year, etc. He didn't react at all, we just carried on talking until I went to bed. The next morning was completely normal, he made breakfast for us, took the ring and said his good-byes.\n\nYesterday he called me in tears. He had picked up on what I said and asked his gf about it. He said at first she wouldn't tell him but eventually told him the whole story. He gave it some time but decided he couldn't marry her so he broke things off. He said it was about how she could keep so something important from him that he didn't think he could trust her ever again. He also told me that he was a little hurt that I didn't tell him at the time but he understood that I thought he knew.\n\nShortly after that I started to get messages from his gf and a couple of college friends saying I'm an AH for telling him and ruining her life. I feel  bad that they broke up and I kind of feel like it's my fault. I legitimately thought she had told him and I was expressing pride that I thought he had grown to accept her reasons/feelings in addition to his own.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676238840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110re5m/aita_for_letting_a_secret_slip_leading_to_a/", "score": 582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was obviously a bad idea to tell your partners sibling, if you don't intend to tell them. His girlfriend should have talked to him about family planning because that is something you talk to your partner about. The fact that she didn't tell him indicates she didn't feel it was safe to tell him, or she hid something important because their plans didn't match up. Either case, that doesn't bode well for a marriage. Frankly, i straight up don't believe you just happened to mention \" that grandma would be so proud after all your troubles over the past year\" right after he asked for a ring, the timing is way way way too convenient.  You saw that she wasn't pregnant, and you felt it was appropriate to congratulate him on his gf's terminated pregnancy?  Was your grandmother Vera Drake? You didn't bother to confirm that she had talked to him about it with the gf, and you just assumed?  Even if you felt obligated to tell him, you should have confirmed with her first before acting to giver her an opportunity. Violence against women happens all the time.  You clearly aren't that involved in their relationship if you didnt bother to talk to her termination or confirm she told him. So you are just assuming, that she wasn't actively afraid to tell him because of violence.\n\nEdit:  per OP's comments, gf purposefully implied she already told him.

She made a choice which was to exclude your brother from the decision or conversation about her pregnancy- her choice. The consequences are that he found out about it and it became something he couldn\u2019t move past.

But she should have told her husband shortly (im talking days) after", "Totally on her.", ">The GF is not an asshole for keeping it from him (or really even for telling the sis, just naive on that one).\n\nYes, she is. It's completely her choice whether to abort or not, but to leave him out of the conversation entirely is not how you handle a relationship. He had aa much a hand in creating that fetus as she did-it doesn't matter that she gets final say, the fact that she couldn't even let him know something major had gone happened in their relationship is uncalled for. She hid a big thing from him for a year. \n\nThe biggest issue with situations like this is that, imo, it demonstrates the lack of trust you have in your partner. If you can't tell your partner \"hey, I'm pregnant, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a kid right now\" or whatever the issue is, why are you with them? If you think they'd do something to prevent you from getting an abortion or not support your choice, why are you with them? If you can't communicate about something like this, what else can't you communicate? If you can hide something like this, what else are you hiding?\n\nIf I was the brother, I would be doubting so many things about this relationship bc of it. I would be wondering if she doesn't trust me to be aupportive of her and thought I would try to force her to carry the pregnancy. I would be wondering if she got an abortion bc she doesn't want kids but didn't say anything bc she didn't want to lose me. \n\n>At that point the baby was a cluster of cells and if he was actually pro-choice finding out wouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker for him.\n\nThat really depends on what her reasoning was for wanting to abort it. If it was just that she wasn't ready or they weren't adequately prepared, that's completely understandable. But she could also have realized that she didn't want kids at all. That's part of why a conversation is necessary: so they can both find out if they're still on the same page or not. \n\nAnd if the brother wasn't pro choice and tried to push her to change her mind, then that's information *she* needs in order to make an informed decision about moving on with the relationship.\n\n>Probs will get downvoted for that but men ending relationships because they found out about an abortion makes them not allies and they can\u2019t call themselves pro choice.\n\nThat's not what happened here. He didn't break up with her bc she got an abortion, he broke up with her bc she hid it from him.", ">men ending relationships because they found out about an abortion makes them not allies and they can\u2019t call themselves pro choice\n\nIn this case I think it's a little simple to say that he ended it solely because she had an abortion.  It's likely a factor but this isn't the only time she's lied to him, albeit by omission this time, in their relationship.\n\nWhen my partner left me when he found out I was pregnant my brother was incredibly supportive.  I thought briefly about not having my daughter and he offered to go with me if that's what I wanted to do.  There was no pressure either way.\n\nPeople can't be put into yes/no categories, the world is degrees of maybes.

Like you you knew she was \u201cgoing to\u201d  tell your sibling, but you didn\u2019t bother to confirm she actually did it. It seems like something you would want your brother to know about before proposing/selecting rings, or that you would confirm with her before for casually mentioning. That\u2019s kinda the sticking point. If you felt the need to keep it a secret/stay out of it, why would you casually bring it up?", "Yeah I\u2019d want to know why she didn\u2019t tell him. I\u2019d be wondering if she really wanted kids or was just dangling that she did so he\u2019d stay with her. Definitely bigger problems than just breaking up. To be clear I\u2019m not saying she should or should not have aborted but wondering why she would not tell the father but confides in his sister?", "I responded to another post but will repeat here.  She asked me to go with her to have the abortion because he couldn't.  In retrospect that implied to me that she had told him.  Again she asked me not to tell him because she said (to him) she was going with her mom.  I was probably a little na\u00efve in taking her at her word. \n\nIt was brought up as part of a longer conversation, not casually.

She definitely purposefully implied that she told him by saying he couldn\u2019t go. Couldn\u2019t go implies that he lacked the ability to come (timing or emotionally, but had knowledge.) not that he was unaware. I don\u2019t think you were naive. I probably would have thought the same based on all previous experience I have with words and syntax (maybe I am naive too).

I can, however, kind of see it from the BFs perspective as that\u2019s the role that matches my experience the most and I just couldn\u2019t see myself bringing myself to care that much if my partner got an abortion so early on when it wasn\u2019t planned. My concern at that point would be with supporting my partner through their decision.", "Yeah, I'd really be questioning why she felt she couldn't tell me. It points to a whole lot of issues in the relationship if she either doesn't feel safe to share that with him or is willing to make big choices without him because talking is hard.

My general view is that whether a person should or should not consult their partner re: abortion is a moot point.  In a healthy, solid relationship with your partner, you will naturally do so because talking over big news is what you do with your partner.  If you don\u2019t - that means you\u2019ve decided partner isn\u2019t the go-to sounding board for big stuff in your life.

It is much better that they found out about this incompatibility before the engagement. I hope in a similar situation you would act similar again, and ask the same of him, you are not only siblings, you are twins... Looking out for each other and having each other's back is a good thing (not making decisions for each other, of course, but when someone keeps important informations a secret).
