We went to the same college and I also became very close with his gf (F28). They've been dating for around six years and my brother has told me that they've discussed marriage and kids but were waiting for him to finish his master's degree.\n\nAround a year ago his gf called me for some advice. She told me that she was pregnant but didn't think that she wanted to have the baby. She wanted my opinion on how he would take it as they have discussed having kids. We're both pro-choice but that said my brother was super supportive when I had my daughter (F3, her dad split before she was born). He has been a great uncle, always talking about how he can't wait to have kids of his own, etc. I told her that it could be a deal-breaker for him but she had to tell him to find out. She said she would be telling him and also asked that I keep it to myself.  He never brought it up with me and there was no baby so I assumed he was working it through on his own (he's like that sometimes).\n\nMy brother asked for help picking out a ring and I offered to let him use our great-grandmother's ring to propose (it was left to me). We agreed he would come for a visit to pick it up just before he's going to ask her.\n\nHe came over last weekend to pick it up. He arranged for some of my friends to take me out for a girls' night and he babysat giving me a much needed break as a small thank you. When I got home I was feeling sentimental so I started tell him how happy our Nana would have been that he's getting married, how he's going to be a great dad and how proud of him I am that they were able to move past their trouble in the last year, etc. He didn't react at all, we just carried on talking until I went to bed. The next morning was completely normal, he made breakfast for us, took the ring and said his good-byes.\n\nYesterday he called me in tears. He had picked up on what I said and asked his gf about it. He said at first she wouldn't tell him but eventually told him the whole story. He gave it some time but decided he couldn't marry her so he broke things off. He said it was about how she could keep so something important from him that he didn't think he could trust her ever again. He also told me that he was a little hurt that I didn't tell him at the time but he understood that I thought he knew.\n\nShortly after that I started to get messages from his gf and a couple of college friends saying I'm an AH for telling him and ruining her life. I feel  bad that they broke up and I kind of feel like it's my fault. I legitimately thought she had told him and I was expressing pride that I thought he had grown to accept her reasons/feelings in addition to his own.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676238840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110re5m/aita_for_letting_a_secret_slip_leading_to_a/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You congratulated your brother for getting over a serious difficulty in his relationship and moving on to the next phase, because that was what you thought had happened. Meanwhile, she kept a big secret in a committed relationship, and she was willing to go into marriage with that secret, even after the two of you agreed that she wouldn't keep it from him. She should never have expected you to keep a secret that big from your brother indefinitely, your twin brother at that.", "NTA. She never should have told you or asked for your advice without already deciding she would talk to him. In fact, because you\u2019re his TWIN and not just her friend, she NEVER should have told you before telling him.\n\nIt\u2019s a blow. Yah.

This is on her.", "NTA, his now ex is the AH for not being honest and open with him.", "NTA. If I were you I'd be pretty pissed that she confided in you, and then never even told your brother. She asked your opinion/advice to make a decision that would have the best outcome for her, and didn't think about how it could possibly effect your brother. She took a risk and is now paying the price plus interest. If she was honest with him from the start, even if he didn't agree with her decision, it could have been something they worked through.", "NTA. You didn't even say anything, you just said their trouble in the last year, he filled in the blanks.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do it on purpose \u2014 I would\u2019ve also assumed my sibling knew about something that important. She\u2019s not mad at you \u2014 she\u2019s mad at herself for being caught up in a very big lie and finding out the hard way what it costs to keep such a massive secret.", "NTA, there's no way you could have ever known she was lying to him about something so huge. Because that's what she did, a major lie by omission. Your brother has the right to feel absolutely betrayed by her, she broke his trust by hiding something so important.", "Nta she should never have put you in that position and your brother is right he can\u2019t trust her", "Sorry. This shit is on her. You are the last person she should\u2019ve been asking for advice on something that should only have been between her and your brother. The fact that she wasn\u2019t honest with him just shows that he\u2019s dodging a bullet.

NTA, the ex sounds so unreasonable.", "NTA. She ruined her own life. You acted in good faith because she said she would discuss it.", "NTA and your brother is right not to trust her.", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for letting it slip to your brother. She shouldn\u2019t have brought this to you unless she was 100 percent ready to tell him because you can\u2019t expect a sibling let alone twin to keep this a secret.\n\nBut some of these not TA posts are way off. The GF is not an asshole for keeping it from him (or really even for telling the sis, just naive on that one). At that point the baby was a cluster of cells and if he was actually pro-choice finding out wouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker for him. She knew he\u2019d care that she did it and frankly at that point it was not his decision and he didn\u2019t deserve a say because it is her body. She wasn\u2019t putting the ability for them to have children off the table or anything. Probs will get downvoted for that but men ending relationships because they found out about an abortion makes them not allies and they can\u2019t call themselves pro choice.", "NTA. Totally fair for her to ask for your silence until she spoke to him. Totally unfair for her to expect your silence forever.", "I will go a bit against the grain and say ESH\n\nShe did ask you not to tell him but she promised she would tell him and hid it.  I understand why he broke up but again I can\u2019t sometimes fathom how relationships completely can crumble so quickly.\n\nIt sounds like she needed support and wanted you to be there for her.  It is sad because it does sound like you two were close and it is unlikely the next person your brother meets will be as close.", "I think you're a tiny bit TA for bringing up her abortion while congratulating him on his engagement. \n\nI don't think you're wrong for assuming she told him, since she said she would. \n\nSadly I think the accidental pregnancy was likely to end the relationship either way, it seems like when she was talking to you to see how he would take the news, she came to the conclusion that he would want her to keep the pregnancy, and therefore decided to make the best choice for herself without telling him. But it's ending now that the truth has come out anyway.", "ESH \n\nExcept your brother.\n\nHis girlfriend shouldn't have told you. It was obviously a bad idea to tell your partners sibling, if you don't intend to tell them. His girlfriend should have talked to him about family planning because that is something you talk to your partner about. The fact that she didn't tell him indicates she didn't feel it was safe to tell him, or she hid something important because their plans didn't match up. Either case, that doesn't bode well for a marriage. Frankly, i straight up don't believe you just happened to mention \" that grandma would be so proud after all your troubles over the past year\" right after he asked for a ring, the timing is way way way too convenient.  You saw that she wasn't pregnant, and you felt it was appropriate to congratulate him on his gf's terminated pregnancy?  Was your grandmother Vera Drake? You didn't bother to confirm that she had talked to him about it with the gf, and you just assumed?  Even if you felt obligated to tell him, you should have confirmed with her first before acting to giver her an opportunity. Violence against women happens all the time.  You clearly aren't that involved in their relationship if you didnt bother to talk to her termination or confirm she told him. So you are just assuming, that she wasn't actively afraid to tell him because of violence.", "ESH. That's a big thing secret to keep, and a difficult thing to hear when you're about to propose. It sucks that it went down the way it did, but that's everyone fault (and it was an accident on your part).", "YTA. You should never assume anything and certainly should not have been the 1 to tell your brother.", "I'm going with NTA but I don't think I'd ever have brought the subject up with someone u without them doing so first. You didn't know how he had dealt with it if he did know, whether bringing it up would upset him or anything. I get you meant well and the issue lies with the ex for not telling him but yeah maybe wouldn't have brought it up for other reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know because she called me and asked if I would go with her because my brother couldn't (her words).  I didn't have anyone to watch my daughter and they live around two hours away so couldn't make it work and she again asked me not to say anything because she told him she was going with her mom.
