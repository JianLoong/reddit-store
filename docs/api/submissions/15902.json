I hate when people dont know the difference between  a play ground and  pizzeria.  \nMy kid at age 4  actually told off a kid att the same age for  running round daft,  that kid went to his mum with chocked  face and told his mum , MUM  you didnt tell me  I couldnt play here!  Why  didnt you know? and I never seen a mum clear out faster after that.", "NTA you are a stranger to that kid.

He also could have been hurt under your table.", "NTA If you don't want strangers shouting at your kids, don't let them climb under strangers tables. These parents baffle me. It only takes one creep to decide to leave the restaurant with your kid, or someone to accidentally kick them and cause them injury.

The parents certainly are tho.", "NTA\n\nEveryone saying you suck is delusional. When you are paying to eat somewhere and suddenly someone is touching your legs from under your table, it\u2019s going to be hard not to say something. It\u2019s not like you went out of your way to scold the kid or you were specifically targeting the child. You were shocked that someone was touching you from under the table. Those parents are assholes, and they are raising little assholes.", "NTA. I'm a parent of 2 (now teenagers) and they would never have behaved like that.

Still, I find it weird that she didn't explain to her kid what happened there.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I would have apologized and kept my kid seated.

Sometimes it isn\u2019t the day to eat out as a parent.", "NTA, and that kid is so lucky you didn\u2019t accidentally kick them in the face!  If an unexpected hand suddenly touched my leg under the table like that my instinct would have been to kick out at it and probably jump and yelp in surprise.  Like, I like kids, I want kids, I dote on my niece, but seriously, some parents are ridiculous and need to actually parent their children.", "Of course you are not the asshole. The kid knew what s/he was doing was wrong, but with no consequences didn't care. Clearly the parents didn't care either. I have major concerns for the next generation. What is wrong with modern parents? (Yes, I am one, but you'd better believe my now 13 year old, NEVER did shit like that and still doesn't.)", "NTA. Knee jerk reaction caused by a serious breach of etiquette and expectation. Mom should have had her kid come over and apologize.", "NTA.

Seemed...unsafe.", "NTA.  I am not interested in being \"entertained\" but other peoples spawn.

What kind of negligent mother sits drinking and chatting while her brats crawl up strangers\u2019 legs?!", "NTA. I would have yelled at the kid too. And the awful irresponsible entitled mom.", "NTA. Her kid was crawling under tables and touching strangers. She's lucky her kid didn't get kicked, because that would have been my involuntary response without even knowing what was happening.", "NTA I have two young boys 6-8 and I would be mortified if they did that to someone else and I would welcome you yelling at them...", "Nta", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the a-hole, but I don\u2019t think yelling was the right route. It could\u2019ve been said more nicely, at least to the kid.", "ESH. Definitely very annoying when parents aren't watching their kids, but dude. Don't yell at a kid.

Don't yell at a child.", "YTA, there are very few reasons to yell at a child and those reasons should be involving life or limb. I get it you were stressed.  Its not the kids fault for being a kid, if anything its the parent's fault. There was a different way to resolve this. Kindly but firmly ask him to come out and ask where his parents are.
