I feel for the kids, but ultimately you have to look out for yourself first when there\u2019s nothing you can do to change your brother.  \n\nI don\u2019t know much about CPS or what they consider worthy of concern, but you could possibly look into that?  They might have a problem with the kids being isolated from the real world like you said.", "As much as the whole situation sucks, it\u2019s out of your hands. Your brother is a misogynistic bigot, who, will likely raise his kids with the same values. As crappy as it is, it\u2019s perfectly legal and nothing can really stop or change it. NTA, but I would cut your losses now. Best to keep a distance at the least, you\u2019ll be the first to blame for anything \u201cwrong\u201d with those kids in the future.", "Yes, your brothers kids will be screwed up.\n\nNot by you the gay uncle but because of their parents. They are homeschooled and not allowed to have friends-why? Are they afraid of the children being exposed to 'strange, new' ideas that contradict what the parents are telling them? What happens when the children turn 18- no college for them to go to? They have to remain home and get safe jobs (a nice manly job for the nephew)?\n\nThese children aren't going to be able to cope with the real world. Either they become more rigid on their thinking or they go the opposite and are swayed by everything. This is what happens sometimes when children who are restricted by their parents in childhood go to college. They don't know how to handle their freedom and it can lead to dangerous situations.\n\nAll I can say is keep the lines of communication open so that you can help if the children need you later on. And start a fund for their therapy sessions.", "Nta I wish those kids got removed from their care there being taught hate.", "Your bro is kind of a jerk. Did you ask your niece & nephew if they wanted an Easy Bake Oven? 11 seems a little old for one & 8 yo may not be interested.If he is, no problem.", "Yikes. He sounds terrible and I think you should stay away from this family OP. I\u2019m so sorry they are painful relatives to have.\n\nNTA op. He sounds controlling and stupid in addition to bigoted.", "Guaranteed it's some fucked up religious bullshit from the brother. tbh there's nothing you can do OP, I'm sorry", "Lol it\u2019s already too late the brother will say he tainted him this early", "PS: keep sending them gifts!!  In the mail!! Let them know you love them.  But stay away from AH brother and his whole house.", "My parents and other brother and I have talked about all of this extensively, my parents and other brother are allies but they\u2019re in the same situation as me in that there\u2019s nothing we can really do to change it.", "Yes that is ultimately the plan. I\u2019d never turn away my nephew or nieces if they needed something or someone to talk to.", "Yeah I probably should tell them why I haven\u2019t been around much anymore. I at least did manage to tell them before this that they can talk to me about whatever they want and I won\u2019t judge or think badly of them. So hopefully if they need that they will come to me for that.", "I\u2019ve thought about that but a couple things 1. there isn\u2019t any real abuse AFAIK and the neglect is nothing the state would do anything about especially with how many kids are already put through the system and 2. the system tends to never really help kids unless they\u2019re in really really bad situations, it\u2019s definitely not that bad for them.", ">exposed to \u201cstrange, new\u201d ideas that contradict\n\nI think this is a major part of it.\n\nAnd yes I really do worry for them for when they\u2019re adults cause like you say they won\u2019t know how to even live in the real world. Idk what my brother\u2019s plan is for that time but I don\u2019t think he has one.\n\nI won\u2019t cut off my nephew and nieces for sure, just feeling I need distance for now.

Your outdated gender stereotype ideology is dying out more and more every day. Good riddance.", "How is op the AH just because the kids are homeschooled? Are homeschooled kids not allowed to have easy bake ovens?", "You sound like a good and caring uncle. I\u2019m sorry that your A brother is ruining your relationship with your niblings. \n\nNTA", "It worse than that. The kids go to a non-denominational fairly okay church but my brother is somewhat secular and his beliefs come from some weird ass Dr Kellogg type purism and virtue crap, he literally had said he thinks that sweet things are bad for you just because they are sweet and that bitter food and drinks are better for the \u201csoul\u201d and body. I\u2019m telling ya idk where he learned all this stuff but he went off the deep end after he had kids, definitely not the loving big brother I remember from my youth.", "Honestly, I doubt there's much you can do for your niblings at this point. But stay in contact - birthday and Christmas presents, cards where you give them your number and email address and an invitation to stay in touch. When they get kicked out for breaking one of your brother's ridiculous rules they'll need a safe place to come to, and you'll be it as long as they know how to contact you.

I go around when it\u2019s their bday or Christmas or something like that, I just don\u2019t go around to actively hang out and chill with them anymore like I used to.", "Not just turn away though. As you distance yourself from your brother, he might try to isolate them from you. You need to make sure they know they can always comes to you, even if you lose touch. Keep the lines of communication open, even if it means creating an email in their name (i.e., jimandjanedoe@xdotcom) that\u2019s easy to remember, so even if your contact info is hidden, they can reach you easily.", "So how does your brother expect them to cope as adults? \n\nIf they don't learn healthy eating habits as children which includes cooking meals, they will have an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\nAre you sure that your brother doesn't have mental health issues?", "Oh wow, yeah that's a hard turn to take. Best of luck to you", "They\u2019re not allowed on the internet so that won\u2019t work about the email. \n\nThey literally live within walking distance so if they really are needing to get away from their dad they can walk over here. And I\u2019ve told them both that before.", "I don\u2019t think he has a plan for when they\u2019re older. \n\nMy nephew definitely already has taken on some really bad eating habits, namely sneaking junk food in excess which has made him gain weight more than usual for a boy his age. \n\nAs for mental health issues he definitely does, but he would never admit that or seek help.", "Why is an 11 year old not a good audience for an easy bake oven? Because he\u2019s a boy? That\u2019s extremely outdated thinking. Unless the kid specifically expressed something that would indicate he wouldn\u2019t be interested in something like that, there is no way of knowing if he would like it or not. It sounds like you\u2019re letting gender stereotypes cloud your thinking, which is sad. Boys nowadays play with Barbie\u2019s, let alone easy bake ovens.", "Good luck to you.", "Basing that on my knowledge from my nieces, honestly. Easy Bake ovens are fun, but don't leave much room for creativity from the kid as far as recipes go. That doesn't mean that there aren't 11yos who love it, but the target audience is closer to 8-9. \n\nI personally don't believe in gendered toys and gifts, but I do try to be thoughtful in what I give. Between our two families we have two nieces 10 and 12 and a nephew 11, nearly 12. None of them would enjoy an Easy Bake Oven because of its simplicity.", "Hmm alright. I still disagree with you about the ages but I apologize for assuming you were saying that because of the gender of the children. I think the sexism of op\u2019s brother left a bad taste in my mouth and made me suspicious.", "I was excluding the brother's sexism, as wrongful as it is. The root of the issue to me is did the nephew want and/or appreciate the gift? Because to me that's what's most important when gift giving.", "NTA. I do not get why people think certain things can turn someone gay or \nthat hanging out with gay people will make you gay. People are just stupid I guess. My sister friends group is like 60 percent gay and she is 100 percent straight. She had these friends since high school and is now in her 30s. Your brother reasons don't make sense. Don't let him put you down or make you feel like you can't be there for your nephew and niece. It sounds like they needs some normalcy in their life. You know I had the same issue. I tried to buy my nephew a easy bake oven and was shot down because apparently it's for girls. It didn't look like the regular easy baked ovens either. So, instead I brought him a unisex kitchen play set without telling anyone and gifted it to him. He loves it.", "Turn him gay?  Over an easy bake oven? Is he aware that a lot of world renown chefs and pastry chefs are men? \n\nOf courae this about YOU being gay?   You being gay is going to turn your nephew gay?  That logic doesn't work, my first thought is 'can they turn you straight? ' Of course the answer is no, it's not the way it works.    It's mind blowing to know that such bigots still exist in this day and age.  \n\nNTA", "Your brother talking about his own daughter like that is really creepy, and very revealing of his character. I understand wanting to keep your distance but if you can find it in your heart to do so keep contact with the kids for their potential safety's sake.", "NTA. Go NC for your own safety and peace of mind. You don't need the toxicity.  They're going to blame you if something goes sideways with the kids. They'll simply blame you no matter what. \n\nStay away", "Brother:\"I don't want you to do anything bad to my son\"\nYou: \"alright fine,I just won't be around him at all\"\nAlso Brother: >:(\nNTA, your brother is confusing the heck out of me with his logic", "NTA - and let the record show I was a fabulous little boy - I mean my little pony collection was unrivaled - fuckin loved brushing them tails.\n\nMy illiterate redneck grandfather bought me most of them - didn\u2019t care if I liked a little girls toy, it\u2019s a horse after all. \n\nDespite the ponies I ended up only finding women attractive - to the shock of some bigoted family. \n\nToys don\u2019t change anyones sexuality and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad", "Cooking is for girls. Being a *chef* is for men.", "NTA Fuck em and that homophobic shit. Don't need toxic bullshit in your life.", "I am 63 and straight, ok cis, and I am appalled by what your brother believes.", "NTA and if you want to keep your sanity you need to go NC indeed because your brother hates gays and you now know it. You tried to form a loving bond with the kids and we love you for it.", "Why are easy bake ovens girly??\n\nImagine bro telling Gordon Ramsey he's gay bcz he like to cook... like what?\n\nNTA. Poor nibling tho.. not getting to socialise at all...", "NTA either way, but if the kids are homeschooled then maybe you could consider putting up with your brother occasionally just to make sure the kids are safe and well and not being brainwashed?", "And also, why is it so important to random old ladies that babies be colour-coded by genitalia? Why is that any of their business?", "Have you read Educated by Tara Westover? Your brother to some extent sounds like her father. I hope you can find a way to keep in contact with your niece and nephew so if they need an out they call for help. \nYou are a good uncle but going LC may be your only option for now.", "Nowadays I've seen an awful lot of extremely confused children. Perhaps branding gendered toys as neutral isn't the best course of action. \n\nAlso if you want to teach your child to bake or cook how about really teaching that kid and let him/her help in the kitchen? That's how you teach those skills, not by giving a boy a girls toy.", "I don't know a single man who can't fry an egg, and yes the household is mainly the domain of women while bringing money to the table is the domain of men, has been that way for ages and results in way more stable outcomes for the children of the relationship.", "Actually no its not, it's making a comeback because your side took ot way to far", "Reducing your existence to having a family and producing children is pretty stupid. Men and women should have the opportunity to choose their future. Limiting their options and shaming boys if they don't like \"manly things\" is harmful. I don't buy that people with that ideology are worried about their children future. They only want to perpetuate a system where they can put people in tiny cages and assign them a label.\n\nWhat if your son decides he wants to be single? What if he is gay, how the traditional family model even fits there? People should be able to explore everything, and gender ideology is honestly disgusting. It breeds discrimination for no reason", "Among radicals and elderly Tucker Carlson viewers maybe. Not among mainstream society. Your side will be dead from old age or in prison from Jan 6 type behavior before you can actually do anything.", "No we're not reducing people, we're guiding people to a healthy path. Guiding boys to accept their masculinity will allow them to follow their true destiny and be truly happy. It also creates a stronger society. A bit of a win win. The ideology of femanising boys is what leads to the harm. \n\nThe putting people in tiny cages and assign a label is exactly what the left is doing with their 100.000.000 genders. Not what conservatives do.\n\nIf my son decides to be single it would be extremely disappointing to me but that's his choice I don't think it would lead to happiness. My son, or any of my children, is not gay though. The chances of your child turning gay magically get a lot lower if you don't throw girl toys at boys and have a strong manly role model. How extremely expected.", "You do know that there's people outside of the USA right?\n So I can assure you I don't watch Tucker Carlson nor am I elderly. As for the January 6th comment, what happened there was blown way out of proportions but nevertheless we don't tend to combine riots and protests in the rest of the developed world. That behaviour is something the USA shares with the 3rd world.\n\nBTW we're not the ones that radically changed gender norms that's your side so I guess you're the radical.", "Frankly I don\u2019t give a shit what you do in your country. Your knowledge of mine seems limited. You shouldn\u2019t comment on the US if you don\u2019t even live here or know anything about it. Keep living with your outdated stereotypes if you want, but here in the most powerful and wealthy country in the world we are changing things for the better.", "The most powerful and wealthy? Yes your army is the most powerful but other than that you're completely wrong. All the wealth I your country is im the hands of what ten guys? And your country is LOSING influence on the world stage (thank god). You're not changing things for the better you're changing it for the worse and funnily enough that will bring you country to ruin.\n\nI'll just stay in my country over here, you know a country with less crime and universal health care.", "Pretty ungrateful for someone in Europe which would have been conquered by either Nazis or Soviets without America protecting you both times. Whatever though, maybe if our influence in the world reduces enough like you want we can withdraw from NATO and let you Europeans tear yourselves apart with war like you always want to do.", "Your brother disgusts me.

You never know what will set off a homophobic outburst in front of his kids and then all of the hate he's teaching them will come out.", "NTA- I  am also gay and have had to deal with this kind of crap. Your brother is not going to change and will probably get worse as his children get to their teens. Best you keep your distance till they are older and of age. Home school and with no friends tell you that this will not be the only problem these kids are going to have to deal with this nut bar. It will likely backfire on him in the future.", "My easy bake oven is definitely why in a nonbinary queer. You may have fooled these straights, but I know the gay agenda. Keep up the good work comrade. Nta", "NTA, sounds like being around your niblings would be too much risk. Protect yourself, go as LC with your brother as you can.\n\nThe kids are old enough to know why you're not around so much anymore, I would make sure they know the truth. You've already told them if they ever need you they will be welcome at your home, unless your brother strays into the realm of abuse there's not much more you can do. (FYI, what he's doing already sounds like abuse to me, but laws are different in different places.)\n\nIf I were you I would have a sit down with the supportive family members and talk about what you're going to do when your brother's bubble pops, because it will. This isn't the 1920s, his kids will be exposed to the real world sooner than he thinks, and they're going to need support.", "So, homophobic, intolerant, kids are home schooled\u2026 I assume your brother is religious?\n\nNTA it just sucks for the poor kids", "NTA but I hope you\u2019ll be able to talk with your nephew and niece soon. I\u2019m concerned your brother will teach them homophobic behavior.", "Even monsters love cookies. Your brother is an asshole. \n\nI don't think you're an asshole for not wanting to deal with this anymore. I understand why you feel guilty but the truth is that you aren't their parents and there's not actually a lot you can do at this point. You're in a not great position if he thinks you're doing something or going to do something to his son. Better to be available later than have that dude come after you now. Sorry.", "I\u2019d say NTA for how you feel, but I\u2019d beg you to stay in those kid\u2019s lives for their sakes - one day they\u2019re going to need an adult to be there for them, and it needs to be someone safe, like you.\n\nHaving grown up with overbearing parents, I can\u2019t emphasise enough how much they\u2019re gonna need you", "Your liberation technique from the nazi's was bombing us to shit and not caring how many of our citizens you murdered in the process. With friends like that we don't need enemies. And yes please withdraw from NATO im fed up with your warmongering and your imperialism."]}
