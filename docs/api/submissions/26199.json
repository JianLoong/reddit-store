Niece is 9.\n\nMy husband and I make a good living which is why we are able to have a big enough house that even niece has her own room. And because I enjoy it and the kids love it, I help them decorate their room however they want and I really let them go crazy with it. It does get expensive especially for 3 boys with very different interests but it\u2019s fun. \n\nMy niece also has a well decorated room. She adores Aurora/sleeping beauty so that\u2019s the theme for her room. I didn\u2019t necessarily ask her mother for permission as all she\u2019s said is  \u201cJust make sure it\u2019s appropriate for a little girl.\u201d\n\nSo I did. She has a massive princess bed with a princess curtain, her walls are pink and my husband and I painted a castle on one of the walls. She also has a doll house and a princess chair with fairy lights on it. There\u2019s also a framed photo of the prince fighting Maleficent. It\u2019s her favorite scene from the movie. We spent a lot of time on this room but it was all ready before she officially moved in for her first summer with us. Till very recently, sil hadn\u2019t seen the room.\n\nShe was picking my niece up a couple days ago to go back home and finally checks out the room. She  calls me stupid the second she sees it. She says she knows I\u2019m a boy mom but she didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be this bad with little girls. I still have no idea what she\u2019s talking about until she starts criticizing every bit of niece\u2019s room. Basically, she was upset because the room is so stereotypically girly and there\u2019s a framed photo of the prince fighting the evil villain and rescuing the princess. I don\u2019t think it matters but my niece always talks about being a princess and has said that she wants a prince to save her. I had no clue my SIL was trying to make her stop thinking like this, it was never mentioned to me.\n\nSil was so pissed off saying that she should\u2019ve known I was encouraging her daughter\u2019s sexist and misogynistic dreams to make my sons lives easier and she said she was thankful I didn\u2019t have any daughters because if I did, she\u2019d get a boring princess room while my sons all have very fun and diverse themes. I apologized and she left angrily. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. As a woman, I know how harmful certain stories can be. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting to be saved by a prince at 9 years old. I wanted to be saved by one till I was like 16 but I never let that stop me from doing my own thing. But I suppose since sil is a single mother and feels strongly about not needing a man, that I should\u2019ve been more aware. She isn\u2019t silent about her views either so I guess I was being pretty stupid.

I would have absolutely LOVED a gorgeous bedroom decorated with my favorite characters.   Your niece is lucky to have you.   You are a wonderful auntie to listen to what your niece wants instead of the craziness that your SIL is talking.  This seems to be about more than just a pink themed room.   How does your niece feel about her room?", "SIL is welcome to pound sand.

I had a playboy bunny room when I was 10-11 as I loved the bunny. Can honestly say I've not grown-up to be a playgirl. I live a very independent life with my own house, car and a great professional job.

Its called growing up!!", "Nta Your niece loves it and that's what's important.", "NTA she loves the room and that is what counts.", "NTA \n\nI had a fairy theme until I was 18 (couldn\u2019t decorate more than once \ud83d\ude05) and honestly loved that I could do what made me happy. Your SIL needs to take the stick out. Your niece is NINE!", "NTA, you decorated the room exactly as your niece wanted. It's her room, not your SIL's.\n\nI kinda knew she was TA when all she said was to 'make sure the room was appropriate for a little girl'.\n\nWhat does that even mean? No words on the wall that say 'boys are the best and girls are all stupid?' No poledancing pole? No live tiger sitting in the corner?", "OP, NTA \n\nYes, some stories can be harmful *if you don't talk about them*. But Sleeping Beauty can be a wonderful lesson about stepping up as a leader. I mean, Aurora had found a man she was attracted to (not knowing he was the man she was betrothed to as well) but when told she was the Princess and had to never see Phillip again, she went to the castle with her head held high ready to do her duty as a Princess and rejoin the role she was born into. It's only after she's left alone that she cries about the (presumably) unfairness of it all and about never getting to see Phillip again. \n\nAnd yeah, Phillip kisses her without consent but I think we can give him a pass since he was told it was the only way to wake her up. It's not like Snow White's Prince (who was in his *30s*) kissing a 14 year old who he thought was dead. \n\nBut to get to the point, you made a room that your niece would love. My mom's favorite Disney Princess as a young girl was Sleeping Beauty and her uncle painted a scene from one of the Golden Books where Aurora's dancing in the woods with Phillip in her bedroom. If my mom, who is one of the most take no prisoners, doesn't need a man to save her type of woman, can have a mural like that in her room as a kid and turn out the way she did, I think your niece will be just fine.", "Your SIL should go fight with Hollywood", "NTA. I think you haven\u2019t considered that your sister in law is probably reacting like this because she is jealous and threatened. Probably coz she didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t do this for her daughter. She probably feels upstaged as a mom. \n\nI don\u2019t have patience for people like your SIL so can\u2019t advise on how to handle her. Maybe other people will be able to advise on the way forward", "My guess is that the majority of girls go through that \"princess-phase\". When i was 9 years old, i knew the difference between real life and fairy tales/disney movies. Didnt stop me from pretending to be a princess or aspiring to be a princess one day. (That didnt work out, so i became a professional geek and my prince got \"rescued\" by me instead of the other way around)\n\nMIL is reading into this way too much. Wanting to be a princess at 9 years old, will not harm her or limit her in any way. As long as she learns how to rescue herself if needed, she can dream of a prince to come and do it for her XD\n\nNTA, the room sounds awesome and i wish you were my aunt when i was 9!!", "It sounds like a fantastic room. I\u2019m jealous!  NTA", "Happy kid in happy kid room..  you're nta.. you're a sweetie.", "NTA \n\nBut did you ever ask your niece what exactly she wants the prince to safe her from?", "NTA\n\nI somewhat understand where SIL is coming from, but I personally think she needs to chill.  Most little girls of my acquaintance go through a princess stage, but they eventually move on.", "NTA\n\nYou decorated the room according to what your niece wanted.\n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nYour SIL is the one projecting what SHE wants for her little girl.\n\nLook\u2026 I\u2019m a boy mum and before I had boys I thought if I\u2019d I have a girl that I\u2019d want a warrior ninja ass kicking princess that would save herself etc etc. anti girly yada\u2026 I mean I hate pink girly stuff..\n\nWhat happened? Well my 5 year old boy got me loving pink and I wear dresses now\u2026 he loves pink, rainbows, unicorns along with Batman, Spider-Man, teenage mutant ninja turtles and Lego.\n\n8 year old is into animals and foraging.\n\nI mean\u2026 your SIL through her hard headed way is actually trying to push what she wants instead of pushing what her own child wants through her view of what girls should have. That\u2019s anti feminism imo.", "NTA. I completely get where she is coming from (I try to give my girls all the options so they aren\u2019t pushed down one route), but the main thing for me here is that you guys clearly went over and above in effort here and there should have been recognition of that. She should have saved her \u2018ffs its all pink and could have been pirate themed\u2019 for when she got home but at least showed gratitude for your intent.", "NTA. I also wonder if SIL feels insecure because she doesn't have the time or money to decorate for her daughter like you did. That doesn't maker her right, but it sounds likes she feels insecure and decided to hone in on the stereotypical princess theme instead of  your income gap.", "NTA, if she likes sleeping beauty/Aurora, then let her like it! Just because your niece likes stereotypical \u201cgirly\u201d stuff doesn\u2019t mean that you or her are supporting of Sexism and misogyny.\nIf she had came up to you and said \u201cI want a dinosaur room\u201d and you said \u201chell no sleeping beauty for u\u201d then I understand where your SIL would be coming from, but you niece said \u201cI like sleeping beauty\u201d \u201cthen sleeping beauty you shall have\u201d\n\nSIL needs to realise that not all feminine girls are wannabe damsel in distresses.", "NTA; if it's what your niece wanted, then I don't see a problem.  It's fine for her (or anyone) to like \"girly\" stuff.\n\nI do wonder if SIL thinks you made the room that way as a generic \"girl's room\", and not because her daughter specifically likes that movie and princess stuff?  Maybe she doesn't realize her daughter is so into it.  It's not impossible that your niece just doesn't express that enthusiasm, interest in princesses, etc., around her mother because her mother disapproves.", "NTA, I'm a 23 years old woman and am currently laying on top of a disney princesses themed bed cover - which includes Aurora - nothing wrong with the room as long as the kid liked it", "NTA- I'd guess that she is worried her kiddo won't want her old room.", "I\u2019m tending toward YTA because the prince fighting the enemy instead of the princess saving herself gives encouragement to stereotypical thinking. The pinkness is not objectionable.", "NTA. The room sounds beautiful and thoughtful. Your SIL is envious and projecting her hatefulness.", "Nta. Kids like things that aren't what their parents want sometimes. Loving \"girly\" things doesn't mean a girls gonna grow up to be useless", "NTA first of all the girl loves Aurora, which means that her mother didn't do a great job of diverting her attention towards more feminist tales. She cannot reasonably expect that you use your time and your rooms to parent her daughter.\n\nAlso, even if we all agree that there are more inspirational tales for young woman, your husband's nice is still a child: she has a lot of time to learn and reflect and select more feminist heroes. As you say, most of us have dreamt at least once to be saved by a prince, but this hasn't prevented us from pursuing our own interests and being aware that we are our own selves, and that supporting men are better than princes.

We talk about some of the things in the movies that are more problematic at an age appropriate level. I\u2019ve also made sure to introduce her to a lot of other great female role models too. We have many books about some amazing women in history. It\u2019s okay that right now she just wants to be a princess cat (a cat princess?) when she grows up.

Of course, she makes them play princesses with her too, and they\u2019ll all be in tiaras and the like. But she can play with whatever and however she likes as long as its age appropriate.", "I loved Belle when I was a kid. I didn\u2019t go seek out a relationship based on Stockholm syndrome as an adult. Your niece will be fine. \ud83d\ude02", "Trying to streer your kids interests is a losing game. My sister wants a girly girl and only buys pink clothes and things. The girl LOVES trains and tractors \ud83d\ude01 and her pink hair ribbons \ud83d\ude01", "My mom decorated my room in all butterflies / caterpillars, I loved Disney princesses, and I now work in tech. Your SIL is being absolutely ridiculous and needs to get a grip because shitting on liking traditionally feminine things is giving internalized misogyny \ud83e\udd22\n\nIdk if you've ever listened to Marina but 'Can't Pin Me Down' would be good homework for SIL / just a fun listen in general. She wrote it to tell people to get bent for having an attitude over her being a feminist that likes traditionally feminine things and refusing to conform BS standards / being anti Pick Me. There are also plenty of great video essays on why feminine things require mental/emotional strength that shouldn't be ignored in favor of masculine traits. Sorry for the mini rant, I just hate when other women devalue femininity in a bid to gain acceptance in patriarchal societies. I'll leave you with my favorite part of the song lol:\n\n\ud83c\udfb6All these contradictions pouring out of me, just another girl in the 21st century. I am never gonna give you anything you expect. You think I'm like the others? Boy, you need to get your eyes checked\ud83c\udfb6", "Why limit yourself? Get as many Barbies into that room as possible.", "The 1959 film is wayyyy more about the Good Fairies vs. Maleficent anyway - Aurora and the Prince are both bordering on being supporting characters in their own movie. They\u2019re literally pawns in the proxy war being fought between the fairies and Maleficent (which, hey, passes the Bechdel Test). \n\nAnd it\u2019s got some of the most stunningly beautiful hand-painted art of *any* Disney movie. No wonder the kid is so taken with the dragon scene. Mom needs to put down the Buzzfeed hot takes.", "This! Also I had to look up \"strident feminist\" and learned something", "While I understand that please talk to your husband if he really wants to go there. Cause it seems you all love your niece, so the question is what's best for her.", "NTA. How sad that the SIL is perpetuating the same type of repressive thinking she is fighting against. She should be happy that her daughter gets to what she wants. \n\nIt should be about choice. Yet, she is taking a page from the playbook she despises to tell her daughter how to think and be. If her daughter wants to be a princess, be a princess. If her daughter wants to be a storm trooper and race car driver, let her be that. Her way of thinking is taking way away daughter\u2019s choice and opinions. How unsupportive.\n\nEdited: grammar", "I see a lot of projecting in her rant & she honestly went a little far re boy mum comment. You did nothing wrong and did what the niece wanted. You didn\u2019t a push princess room on her - it was all her wish. SIL needs to get a grip and get off her high-horse. Dont feel bad about anything - you made a nine year girl very happy for the summer.", "Yes, in my opinion it's about valuing individual choice, but also promoting the less traveled path, for more girls to be aware that it is possible.", "But do you own far too many books?", "My older daughter loved Tangled/Rapunzel and used to tell people that was her name. Granted, she still has time as she's young, but she has yet to assault anyone with a frying pan.", "Eh respectfully disagree about the Stockholm syndrome allegation since Belle only really started to fall for Beast after Beast changed his ways and started showing an interest in her interests. Plus he let Belle *go* to save her father and Belle left. \n\nBut I'm not going to lie, if a man could give me Belle's library (or even a room I could turn into Belle's library), I could look past the excess hair and singing furniture lol.", "\u2026..yes, yes I do. \ud83d\ude02", "You can never, ever own too many books.", "This is not a problem though", "Yeah, but is her hair long enough to climb?", "\u2026.yeah it was a joke.", "Same here.", "No, but not from lack of her trying. Trims and other reasonable cuts keep ruining the dream.", "Ah apologies there! My brain's still in weekend mode so I guess I didn't realize it was a joke. Apologies again :D", "There's no such thing as too many books. Just not enough bookshelves.", "Really, you did make a good point.  I had never thought of that line of reasoning before.", "I need more bookshelves again but I'm running out of places to put them!", "I read an article about this guy in NYC that had so many books that he had to have special bookshelves and reinforced walls so the place wouldn't cave in.  It's a good thing I prefer e-books because otherwise, this could be me!"]}
