(On a Throwaway acc)\n\nRecently (around the last 4-5 months) I\u2019ve recently been opening up to my mother. Mainly about my step mom, who I met when I was roughly 5. I\u2019ll call my step mom Emma.\n\nEmma is nice to me 60% of the time. I\u2019m not going to give every single detail about me here for privacies sake, but I will give my side of the story. Sometimes Emma goes from perfectly fine to absolutely pissed off within the drop of a hat. Or she\u2019ll act all nice to me towards my face, but then shit talk me to my dad. \n\nExample: After (what I thought) was a great night out and eating dinner, I get sent to bed. I then hear my parents talking. Emma is saying all this shit about how I\u2019m just \u201ca spoiled little shit\u201d that \u201ccauses her so much stress for no reason\u201d and other stuff like that. I hear her tell my dad that she\u2019s tired of him enabling my behavior, which she hasn\u2019t even BOTHERED to talk to me about, so I\u2019m clueless about what I\u2019ve done wrong. \n\nSometimes Emma just takes her anger at my father out on me sometimes too. \n\n-Like yelling at me for stuff that isn\u2019t my  Fault/that I have no control over\n-splashing water in my face when I asked for a good night hug before bed\n-going full cold turkey on me with no warning, and occasionally telling me to piss off\n\nEmma\u2019s also just yelled and yelled at me for close to an hour (longest was 1 and a half hours) and told me to stop being dramatic when I started to cry. Whenever Emma yells I never get more than the words \u201cyes ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cyes I understand\u201d whenever I get yelled at. I can\u2019t even begin to explain why I did something without being told to stop making excuses.\n\nI\u2019ve been telling my mom about this stuff and she\u2019s been talking with my dad about it, and she thinks I\u2019m being ab-sed. That was conveyed to Emma that I\u2019m the one saying that she\u2019s ab-sing me (which I haven\u2019t, she just thinks I have) and has left the house a multitude of times just cause she can\u2019t handle me or some shit like that.\n\nShe\u2019s only said that she\u2019s sorry twice in my lifetime. While I do accept that apology, those wounds of a 14 year old getting screamed at and clonked over the head for a backpack not being organized still sit with me, and probably will stick with me for years.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my mom what\u2019s been going on?\n\nEdit: I feel like I should add on WHY she\u2019s so pissed off at me over the part year or so. \n\nI don\u2019t have a phone, only an iPad (this is important)\nMy iPad was connected to her old spare phone. She could read all my texts remotely from there. She found out I drank (one time, did nothing. It was handled by my mother.) she would read my texts as well. When she read that I drank she said that she had no parental right over me anymore and that I shouldn\u2019t say sorry to her. One thing about the drinking is that she would tell me ALL THESE STORIES about how she would sneak out with her friends and go drinking until 4am on school nights.\n\nShe though I was airdropping p0rn to people at my school, yet didn\u2019t listen to me when I said I was then one being sent it.\nShe blamed ME for my screen time glitching out (letting me talk to my friends WHILE ON VACATION) and I got basically grounded for the rest of the trip.\nI went to my moms house while she wasn\u2019t home with a friend (one that they\u2019ve both known for years, it was just for water and a phone charge) and I got shit for that\n \nThese are the things I can think of right now, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more that I\u2019ll remember tomorrow.

It's not sincere.  She's sorry she got caught and that it's causing her strife.  She'll be even more angry at you the next time you're alone with her because she perceives everything that happens from here on out as a direct product of *your* actions, not *hers*.  She's probably in big trouble at home, and is hoping like hell that a quick \"sorry\" will suffice so that she can go right back to her previous life and behavior - like a little kid.  If you can, make sure you let her know that you understand that she's not sorry at all, and she needs to prove herself with her actions; you'll accept the receipts from her seeing a psychiatrist 2-3 times a week as proof of her wish to change.  Then, after a time (I'd say a good year to two years ought to be enough time), she can try apologizing again to you in front of her psychiatrist, in a safe space, where her excuses won't be welcome or tolerated.  If she declines, well, you'll know that she's really not sincere in that apology, and you don't need to accept it.\n\nAs for remembering the backpack incident, it was only two years ago.  That's practically yesterday.  There is such a thing as forgiving but never forgetting, should you even choose to forgive.  It's probably best that you never forget because something tells me that she'll be right back up to her old tricks the moment no one's looking.\n\nStay away from her.
