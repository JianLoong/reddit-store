But if she's only complaining when she's in your room;  that's because you spend the most time in there, so your perfume would be the most heavily concentrated in there \n\nContinue to wear it around her.

I don't need to visibly see perfume bottles to know it's being worn.   \nThe fact that she wasn't reacting until she saw them makes this a control issue.", "NTA- At the age of 16, you are allowed your privacy. If she ONLY is bothered when IN your room, then she can stay OUT of YOUR room! Problem solved.", "YTA. Your step mom may have presented the issue poorly, but intentionally giving other people actual headaches is inconsiderate. Since this is a medical issue you need to give her the benefit of the doubt. It's entirely possible that she didn't put two and two together until she was in your room.", "YTA\nYou might not know how strong it smells because you wear it all the time and you already knew she didn't like it. She probably gets migraines from strong scents (I do too). Just don't put on any when you're in her house, it's not that difficult", "As someone incredibly sensitive to smells and who also gets headaches from them, you need to yield on this one. When you're eventually out of the house you share with people, do whatever you want. I'm not sure why this was an issue prior, but it doesn't matter. It's an issue now. Additionally, she's an adult of the house. As long as it's a reasonable request, which hers is, you need to mind your stepmon.\n\nYTA", "Some people just can't handle strong smells. When I do I my brain shuts off and I feel sick.", "YTA. Her rule was no perfume, right? That's a house rule. It means no perfume. Maybe there's mold that's causing her headaches, but she knows it's something different from where she lived before. And she knows perfume in the past has given her a headache.\n\nI understand her side because I have asthma. Sometimes I can't smell it but I'll start choking up. If I found out someone was wearing perfume I would realize that I only choke up around them and would ask them to stop wearing it. And maybe you enjoy the scent, but you can't even smell it on yourself after you have it on after a while, so the scent isn't even for you. At that point it's for everyone else.\n\nIt's difficult to have a family transition like yours. Apologizing to her and then no longer wearing the perfume will help a lot for you two getting along. There might be other battles ahead between the two of you. Let her win this one.", "Perfumes cause allergies for prime, which leads to coughing, sore throats and headaches.  I think it's fair for your stepmom to ask you to not wear perfume around the house.\n\nSome people also wear TOO MUCH perfume to the extent it's cloying (and tacky).\n\nSomething to think about if you're a considerate person.

Rash, migraines, nausea, brain fog....  \n\nHow would you like it if some one fed you something you were allergic to intentionally?", "YTA because it's a headache trigger, this is why a lot of schools and workplaces ban strong scented perfume.

Those scents are usually synthetic (fabric softener is the absolute worst), but everyone is different. I also LOVE perfume. My user name is literally one of my favorite perfumes from when I was a teenager. I love being completely immersed in a beautiful scent. For myself, I have found that the more natural a scent is the more tolerable I find it. Fragrance oils seem to be the least bothersome.

You wrote that \"she doesn't like\" and that \"she *says* it gives her a headache\" because you want us, on Reddit, to doubt it\n- You wear a perfume inside the house, and it is a strong one.\n- You believe that you are putting on very little of it, because you can't smell yourself much. However most people who wear perfume put on too much, so your very little is probably enough to be smelled by other people and it leaves a slight trail around the house. This trail would not be noticeable to most people, but is enough to trigger your stepmother's symptoms.\n- She has told you before that she is sensitive to smell, and you had agreed to not wear scents in the house.\n\nIt's not fair that she is sensitive to scent, and it's not fair that you can't do whatever you want to your own body. Unfortunately scent is one of those few personal image choices that genuinely affect other people.\n\nI suggest you apologise to her for having triggered her headaches, say you didn't realise that you were affecting her (you're still a kid, you're allowed to be oblivious sometimes) and agree that from now on you won't wear scent inside the house.\n\nYou can buy perfumes in tubes, keep one in your handbag (if you have other perfumes at home, keep them well closed up), apply a single spray to one wrist, then dab that wrist to your other wrist, and then dab both wrists to your neck, and go about your day. Before coming home, you can go to a bathroom and wash your wrists and neck to remove lingering traces of the perfume.", "YTA. I feel like we're not getting the full story from your POV. If you have always known and tried to wear less and less, I don't believe that her seeing the bottle in the room was the first time that she got angry about it.

I don't wear them at home, nor when I'm going out with them.\nI toss them in my backpack and when I get outside I spray them on. No big deal.\n\nWhat I do find a big deal is how your Stepmom never even noticed you wear perfumes, and only started getting these \"terrible headaches\"  once she knew you were wearing perfume. That means the headaches are not caused by the perfume, but in her mind. \n\nIt's either a placebo or she's just controlling", "NTA. She didn\u2019t notice until she went into your room?

Because it's not fair to ask her to get sick doing basic household jobs.)\n\nI will say, this happens with my stepdaughter. And I have mentioned it to her, when she hit an age that she was exploring scent.... but gave up, because she spends so little time with her dad, and if every time she walks into a room I reminded her that the choice of lotion or whatever it is that she has at her mom's makes me ill, it WILL feel yucky, for both of us.

I have to.\n(Makes me feel like a monster, but it feels kinder than harping every time she arrives.)\n\nSo, be compassionate and make sure she knows you CARE, and ask her if you can talk about what actually bothers her and what doesn't so you can have some scent without making her sick. \n\nSome info.... Just to articulate, in case understanding helps.... One thing that's hard about scent is, like all sensitivities, sometimes it's worse and sometimes it's better. And it's not about whether it's pleasant. \n\nCompare it to sound sensitivity.... If someone is playing music, sometimes that's FINE. Even loud! We all like a good, music so loud you can feel it, dance session to shake off a bad mood, or energize a project, or.... whatever. \nBut... Sometimes it's overwhelming and you have to ask them to turn it down. It doesn't mean the music was bad, just too much for me right now. Tho sometimes it's a pitch that just feels like nails on a chalkboard. (Still doesn't make it bad for YOU, just for ME. I'm sure some music I pick also makes you want to throw things.)\n\n *The problem with scent, though* ... I can't ask you to \"turn it down\" if it's too much in this moment. You'd have to like, shower and change your clothes? The intensity and concentration of scent isn't as easy to control in a fluid way. And, it's also important to know that some smells will ALWAYS trigger (Ylang Ylang gives me an immediate headache. Also, whatever perfume my MIL used to wear.... She loved it and it made me so sick!!!!! I loved HER, but damn, that perfume!! And certain hand soaps and lotions, unfortunately often I find out only after having to wash my hands in a restroom or having my kids radiate something nuclear when THEY do.)\nSo, be patient and compassionate, because this frustrated the hell out of folks that are triggered, too... And know that it's not about you, or your choice of perfume. (Pricier perfumes OFTEN have less triggering scent components, fwiw, because they don't rely on chemical substitutes or something?... but not always. MIL's perfume is an example.... I don't remember now what it was, but it wasn't drug store knockoff perfume, it just had something in it that made my whole sensory system overload. Whereas my grandmother's everyday scent never triggered that. My mom's fave when I was little was fine, but she switched when I was in college and I couldn't ever lend her clothes anymore because I'd get sick trying to wear them when they came back.)\n\nGood luck, kiddo.
