But if she's only complaining when she's in your room;  that's because you spend the most time in there, so your perfume would be the most heavily concentrated in there \n\nContinue to wear it around her.  If she doesn't like rhe smell of your room, she can stay out of your room", "NTA. I get headaches from strong perfumes, and they cause me to cough heavily. I don't need to visibly see perfume bottles to know it's being worn.   \nThe fact that she wasn't reacting until she saw them makes this a control issue.", "NTA- At the age of 16, you are allowed your privacy. If she ONLY is bothered when IN your room, then she can stay OUT of YOUR room! Problem solved.", "YTA. Your step mom may have presented the issue poorly, but intentionally giving other people actual headaches is inconsiderate. Since this is a medical issue you need to give her the benefit of the doubt. It's entirely possible that she didn't put two and two together until she was in your room.", "YTA\nYou might not know how strong it smells because you wear it all the time and you already knew she didn't like it. She probably gets migraines from strong scents (I do too). Just don't put on any when you're in her house, it's not that difficult", "As someone incredibly sensitive to smells and who also gets headaches from them, you need to yield on this one. When you're eventually out of the house you share with people, do whatever you want. I'm not sure why this was an issue prior, but it doesn't matter. It's an issue now. Additionally, she's an adult of the house. As long as it's a reasonable request, which hers is, you need to mind your stepmon.\n\nYTA", "Some people just can't handle strong smells. When I do I my brain shuts off and I feel sick.", "YTA. Her rule was no perfume, right? That's a house rule. It means no perfume. Maybe there's mold that's causing her headaches, but she knows it's something different from where she lived before. And she knows perfume in the past has given her a headache.\n\nI understand her side because I have asthma. Sometimes I can't smell it but I'll start choking up. If I found out someone was wearing perfume I would realize that I only choke up around them and would ask them to stop wearing it. And maybe you enjoy the scent, but you can't even smell it on yourself after you have it on after a while, so the scent isn't even for you. At that point it's for everyone else.\n\nIt's difficult to have a family transition like yours. Apologizing to her and then no longer wearing the perfume will help a lot for you two getting along. There might be other battles ahead between the two of you. Let her win this one.", "Perfumes cause allergies for prime, which leads to coughing, sore throats and headaches.  I think it's fair for your stepmom to ask you to not wear perfume around the house.\n\nSome people also wear TOO MUCH perfume to the extent it's cloying (and tacky).\n\nSomething to think about if you're a considerate person.  If you're not, I guess that would make you the AH.", "She noticed, she just hadn't said anything because you knew about her headaches.  Seeing, and smelling it, in your room just identified the culprit to her.  YTA.\nI used to work in a Duty Free shop selling high end designer parfums. I can guarantee you that most people who claim to \"wear only a little\" or use it \" lightly\" are wearing FAR more than needed.  And you're wrong about the scent not travelling.  When you put parfum on, you become desensitized to the scent within a few minutes, and cannot accurately gauge how strong it is anymore.", "YTA... perfumes can make people really sick. Rash, migraines, nausea, brain fog....  \n\nHow would you like it if some one fed you something you were allergic to intentionally?", "YTA because it's a headache trigger, this is why a lot of schools and workplaces ban strong scented perfume.  She doesn't just dislike it, it triggers a negative physiological reaction", "Yta.\n\nShe probably never noticed before because maybe other people in the house don't use it or they use less. \n\nHer getting a headache from the fumes is very normal. You can put it on after you leave the house etc.", "NTA, in case people can\u2019t read: you\u2019ve been wearing the perfume and it wasn\u2019t a problem. But she sees the perfume and suddenly it\u2019s a problem? NTA she\u2019s just starting shit. Unless she was like ah I have headaches every day and I don\u2019t know why and you left that out.", "It's complicated. I have chronic migraines that can be heavily aggravated by certain scents. Those scents are usually synthetic (fabric softener is the absolute worst), but everyone is different. I also LOVE perfume. My user name is literally one of my favorite perfumes from when I was a teenager. I love being completely immersed in a beautiful scent. For myself, I have found that the more natural a scent is the more tolerable I find it. Fragrance oils seem to be the least bothersome. I doubt that you will be able to talk to her about this for a few weeks, but when you feel up to it, try asking her about what doesn't bother her.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s very sad for you that you can\u2019t wear perfume in your home, but someone else\u2019s right to be healthy is more important than your right to smell pretty.", "YTA - Why not just apply perfume after you\u2019ve left home, most of the scent will be gone by the time you get back home. Or just be compassionate and give her the benefit of the doubt? Who wants to have to live with a constant headache in their own home?", "NTA several scents trigger my migraines and asthma. Perfume is one of them but if she didn't have any issues until she saw it, she's lying lol", "YTA it gives her headaches, regardless of the quality, it\u2019s effecting her quality of life so don\u2019t.", "YTA. Completely disrespectful and juvenile behaviour. Grow up kid.", "YtA for testing her and pushing the boundaries.  It's a pretty big deal to some ppl and you could make her ill for no good reason", "YTA. Chemical sensitivities and allergies to scents are a really big deal. She likely didn't say anything before because she didn't know what was causing it. You can show some basic respect and consideration for people on your home.", "YTA", "YTA. It is very disrespectful to wear perfume around someone who's allergic. And I can guarantee you it has nothing to do with the expense of the perfume. Save your \"not Bath and Body Works\" scent for other occasions when you won't be around your MIL.", "YTA.  Perfume gives lots of people a headache.  She already asked you so just stop wearing it around her", "NTA. She's very controlling. Stepmother shouldnt make rules for you.", "The smell never leaves my area of the house which she is never in", "NTA she has an issue with it? She can stay out of your room", "YTA. Put your perfume on only for special occasions, don't put it on in the house and shower when you come home. Strong scents really do bother people.", "YTA your pleasure shouldn\u2019t be more important than her health.", "Personally I dislike 99% of all perfumes. A shower and **very** mild scented deodorant does the trick for most people. \n\nThere are few things worse than hopping on an elevator or some other enclosed space with someone that is wearing a strong perfume only to have your nose assaulted and your eyes burning. It can even linger for 15-20 minutes after they exit.\n\nPlease don't use perfume in public, just have good hygiene. Save it for later when you have more private encounters where it is appreciated.", "NTA\n\n> She doesn't like stronger perfume saying it gives her a headache. \n\nSo she can take a pill. Or find a partner whose children don't wear perfume.\n\n> she has never noticed until she went in my room.\n\nSounds like you found a good way to keep your stepmom out of your room.", "Nta", "I like to smell nice but today I never wear perfume and usually try to find non scented products because so many places are now scent free. The last 3 places where my husband has  worked, he has been told that scents are not allowed. My doctor, dentist, and chiropractor all ask that you do not use them. So many people are sensitive to them. \n\nWe once went on a one day cruise with a large group of friends and an email went out before hand asking everyone to use unscented shampoo, deodorant, detergents, creams and body lotions, etc. One guy's wife is extremely sensitive to them.\n\nNow, I only smell good at home. :(", "NTA. Even if she doesn\u2019t like strong scents, you should still be able to wear them. You can just minimise what you wear if you\u2019re going to be directly around her for a period of time. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. The fact she didn\u2019t notice frankly suggests she is exaggerating her sensitivity.", "Spray it in her room", "It might be worth not only taking a clear dated photo but either using a lock or concealing at least some of your perfumes. Growing up there were a few times I visited my Dad's and found items removed or one time sold for a paltry amount without my permission (it was often books but one time it was an expensive doll that got given to my younger siblings without any warning and it was promptly destroyed).", "Definitely NTA! She is definitely trying to pull the power card!", "NTA. It is all in her head.", "NTA\nI get headaches from any smells at all, even a spray deodorant.

I pretty much told our mutual friends that she could never be around me again, and if we were both invited places, I wouldn't show up.", "That you were made aware of. She may not have been aware of it herself until the moment she identified the culprit of her headaches. Perfume is aggressive and at the very least, why don't you care that you're making someone uncomfortable in their own home? Does your desire to smell like a fragrant mix of chemicals really matter more to you than her physical well being?

It's actually considerate. You're forgoing a trip in consideration of someone else who would have issues sure to the scent.\n\nI think it's kind of crazy though that the friend's wife would expect everyone to go out and buy all new unscented stuff just to go on a one day trip.

Definitely.
