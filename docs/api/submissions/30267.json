My son and my wife gets home before I do. Today was the last day of his grading cycle and he got all a\u2019s except for one b. He takes school seriously and I wouldn\u2019t even punish him for a c or even an f if it was a one time thing. It\u2019s Friday so he is usually on his Xbox with his friends. When I asked my wife where he was she told me she grounded him for getting a b on his report card. I thought she was joking at first because I couldn\u2019t fathom being that strict on him. When I asked her where he really was she gave me a confused look. When I realized she was serious I told her to give him his phone back. I told her she was not to punish him for any reason even if it was justified. She told me that was stupid and she should have equal say. This might make me an asshole but I laughed at her response and told her that was the dumbest thing I heard. I told her just because she\u2019s his new stepmother doesn\u2019t mean she gets equal say in punishment, especially if she\u2019s going to wrongfully punish him. She told me a b is nothing to be proud of. I told her that\u2019s subjective and I doubt he is proud of it. She called me an asshole for not letting her be a mom. I think I should mention that me and his mom are still friends and talk to each other so her wanting to be his mom isn\u2019t realistic.

Asserting she is an equal say in discipline to you is concerning. Assuming she's a mom to a kid who *already has a mom* is ... well, a red flag.\n\nBut unless you are going to be there 100% of the time your wife and son are in the same place, she needs *some* authority. The two of you--or possibly even the two of you and your ex--need to sit down and discuss what step mom's boundaries are.

Then communicate those boundaries to your son.\n\nGood job standing up for your son.", "NTA for defending your son, but you are for subjecting him to your wife.

I personally don't think a step parent should EVER discipline a stepchild. It never turns out well. Even if it was his actual mom, that decision should not have been made without a prior discussion and both parties agreeing it was the right thing to do. Your wife absolutely crossed the line. Good on you for standing up for your son, you sound like a good dad. \n\nThat being said, you could have handled it a bit better in how you addressed her but tbh I would have done worse.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is on a powertrip, let her go... Preferably somewhere far, far away from your child.", "NTA.  Your wife needs a serious reality check.  She punishes her stepson for getting all As and one B on his report card.

I shudder to think how that's going to impact your marriage.", "NTA\n\nShe clearly wouldn't be a good mom.

Regardless, that kind of pressure and the \u201cnot good enough \u201c attitude will surely cause mental health issues for your son.", "NTA I think I missed the part where you say you yelled at her? If you were both raising your voices, that doesn't make you the AH. It sounds like you had a conversation and explained that she is not his mother and should not be making decisions about his punishment, especially without your knowledge and consent.\n\nI do think you need to have a private conversation with your son and find out what else your wife has been doing when you're not home. Grounding him for a B is pretty far over the line and she may be doing or saying other things to him that you will want to stop.", "My mom punished me for have a 92 in chemistry which was considered a B (1 point from an A). I went to school begging to get extra credit so i could get ungrounded and my teacher was baffled i was even grounded over my grade. Thats just one example of my long history of my mom causing me to hate school to the point i dropped community college because it made me so depressed and every time i thought about going back itd trigger panic attacks. \n\nSo to answer your question, I say NTA but your wife is. She had no right to ground him, and grounding him over a B will bring unnecessary stress and other issues. You sound like a good father who actually cares about your sons wellbeing", "NTA your son is learning that if he\u2019s not at his best all the time he will be punished. A B is still great and I\u2019m sure he can do better next time. He will still get into college with one B.", "NTA. \n\nPart of being a parent is having a UNITED FRONT. If she isn\u2019t willing to communicate to you and your ex and all agree on a punishment, if any, TOGETHER, she just wants control, NOT to be a mom.", "I was heavily punished for Bs. Perfection in school was a requirement. \n\nI haven't spoken to my parents in well over a decade.\n\nTake that as you will. You're NTA.", "INFO: Before she became step mom, was there any discussion about her role, if any, in discipline?", "Punishing your kids at all for grades is so dumb. Top tier boomer bullshit. As if grades matter that much. I was a straight C student in high school and now easily outearn all the kids who stressed about getting perfect grades from my class.", "NTA. My parents always said they would be okay with the grades I got as long as I asked for help when I needed it and tried my best. When I got poor grades in chemistry despite studying and having a tutor, they didn\u2019t punish me, cause they knew I was trying and just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the material. Punishment for grades is unproductive. A B is not a failure. No one\u2019s perfect at everything, and your son getting a lower grade than expected does not correlate to lower worth as a person.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s not a mom. Your son already has a mom. She can be a stepmom if she likes, but that\u2019s different. I only started bonding with my stepmom when she accepted I already had two parents and was not looking for a third.", "NTA - I am going to start by saying that I disagree that parents don't get a say in punishment, after all, imagine if she walked in on a young child playing with matches that have gotten to be taken care of immediately.  \n\nThe problem here is that she can't just walk into your child's life and decide what is and isn't acceptible in school. Even if this was a bad report card, which it hardly sounds like it was, this did not require that she immediately take any action; it could have waited for you to come home and have a discussion. \n\nWhat your wife needs to understand is that disciplining a child is only effective if both parents are on the same page. Deciding on a punishment for a situation that had no urgency without your input set herself up to now not be taken seriously by your child.", "NTA. Let the parents do the parenting. Especially when it comes to non-behavior issues! A B, you should be very proud!!", "NTA", "I am 71 years old. I remember coming home with my report card in high school with all As and on B.

It's still a good grade!\n\nYour wife is crazy to think she can just punish your kid without talk8ng to you or the kid's mother. Definitely watch her actions because punishing a kid for a B is insane and who knows what else she would punish him for if given a chance.", "Seriously did you and your wife discuss her role in your son's life prior to your marriage? Had she expressed to you that she felt that she had some type of right or responablituy to discipline him? \n\nShe isn't his parent and by your descriptions both of your son's parents are active participants in his life. She isn't really a stepmother either. She is just the wife of his father at this point. A stepparent relationship has to be built it is not an entitlement granted to her by your marriage certificate and stepparent is not usually equal to parent (in certain cases in certain family situations). She is incorrect when she states she has equal say and you are not allowing her to be a mother...because SHE IS NOT A MOTHER and definitely not your son's mother. Maybe eventually you could ask for her input about a punishment but that is as far as it should never go and it does bot mean you will implement what she suggested especially given how harsh she is being over a B on a report card. \n\nYou need to speak with your son alone about his relationship with your wife and how he is treated when you are not around. Then you need to have a serious talk with your wife about her position and place in your son's life. Given how she is acting she will be unhappy and argue but she is way way out of line as of right now. Family counseling may be in order to get your blended family back on track. Make sure your son's health, development and happiness are your top priority given this situation. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019ve told this story quite a bit.

She nuclear melted on him, they got physical until the cops came. Never seen that shit in home before. \n\nNTA, not that extreme as in my case. However I\u2019m not agreeing with the step parent discipline. Especially with no communication as adults. You say as a stop mom she wants 50/50, well she sure didn\u2019t take you in consideration with your son. \n\nThat argument goes both ways not that id agree to that with my daughter or son.

When I asked my wife where he was she told me she grounded him for getting a b on his report card. I thought she was joking at first because I couldn\u2019t fathom being that strict on him. When I asked her where he really was she gave me a confused look. When I realized she was serious I told her to give him his phone back. I told her she was not to punish him for any reason even if it was justified. She told me that was stupid and she should have equal say. This might make me an asshole but I laughed at her response and told her that was the dumbest thing I heard. I told her just because she\u2019s his new stepmother doesn\u2019t mean she gets equal say in punishment, especially if she\u2019s going to wrongfully punish him. She told me a b is nothing to be proud of. I told her that\u2019s subjective and I doubt he is proud of it. She called me an asshole for not letting her be a mom.

In this instance rescinding her punishment you are NTA but I think you should sit down with everyone (step and bio mom) and set boundaries for how she (step) should handle situations she takes issue with regarding your son in the future, even if you stand firm on her having no right to punish him.  I think you should talk soon, others here have pointed out her future punishments could become more subtle if this stays the way it is. That said good luck", "What schools don't tell you is that C is actually a good grade. I wish theyd stop being so heavy handed with this narritive of Cs being bad because it creates parents who stress their kids out and punish them stupidly for \"doing bad\" at school. C means you've achieved what they expected of you and met the curriculum standards. A and B are great, it means you did above and beyond, but that doesn't mean a C is bad or that you're stupid and not hard working. \n\nThis is why \"Cs get degrees\" is a thing. They do. It means you passed. You met the standard required.\n\nSo a B is something to be proud of. Your kid did better than was expected of him. And to punish him for that one B in a sea of As? Yeah, she's on a power trip and can't be trusted giving reasonable punishment. \n\nShe definitly needs to consult you on any punishments she wants to give. Especially on smaller stuff like this. If it's like \"he threw the TV out the window so I took his phone and consoles\" then that's a bit different in the moment.

She was extreme and wrong but that is fundamentally a bad statement.  I have no kids and no stepkids and have disciplined several friends or even acquaintances kids for doing wrong stuff. Again it\u2019s not about this situation but to state that adults shouldn\u2019t help a child learn via disciplining them is a ludicrous statement. The parents have always thanked me for intervening and setting their kid straight.", "Some times it does work for a stepparent to give punishments. It all depends on the situation and couple.", "If stepparents should NEVER discipline then don\u2019t call them stepparents. Call them the parents spouse", "I am surprised to see such unanimity in this forum on this issue. Admittedly, my experience/knowledge of step parents is very limited as almost everyone I know is either married/parenting with the bio parent or single parenting but I find it hard to understand how one can be a 'step'mom but not have the authority to be a mom. \n\nLike if one is the mom then one gets to make food for the kid, take care of the kid when he/she is unwell but if they do something then only the spouse gets to discipline them. What's the 'mom' in that version of stepmom, and more broadly the parent in the stepparent? \n\nWhat you describe sounds like one person single parenting and the other being someone who lives in the same house. Like it sounds like that person is not gonna be the one taking care of that kid or making food for that kid because they are not the mom/dad.\n\nUnderstood there is the possibility of abuse and also that respect is earned by being there for a kid and not just given, but this sounds very unhealthy to me and also legally, very poor strategy. \n\nThe step parent has to live with the choices of the kid and the kid has to live with the choices of the step parent. For example, if the bio parent gets cancer, the step parent has to be the proxy. If  they don't even have enough understanding for the step parent to punish by taking a phone away then how is that gonna work? 2-3 decades later, if you are not a parent for the years when the kid is growing up then you are not going to be a parental figure when the will comes around or when there are hard choices such as selling a jointly owned house.\n\nIMO, the bioparent has to choose very carefully to ensure the stepparent will be a parent and then let them be a parent fully or don't get re-married at all. I do think a step parent who is ok being married to the bioparent but not being a parent is being very stupid because if that filial bond is not formed then he/she will share legal roles and responsibilities without the love that is assumed to be at there at the core of those roles and responsibilities. \n\nFor instance, if the kid is a minor, the stepparent is responsible under the law for the minor's actions (in loco parentis). The law is not gonna listen to any rationale about who got to punish the kid or not -- the step parent is going to be somewhat responsible too. For instance, if the kid damages someone else's property then the bioparent and the step parent will both get sued. I doubt the step parent can shield their half of assets by saying they are not parenting because they are the step parent and only married to the bio parent. Or even underage drinking and stuff like that -- there is a question of parental liability and some of it will fall on the step parent. This stuff is very serious -- a kid is a serious responsibility.\n\nAlso a stepparent who is not involved in parenting -- that person is the most likely to scheme to screw the kid they are not a parent to. That kid is then a competitor for the same resources the step parent wants from the bioparent, from money to time to affection. You want the step mom/dad to care about the kid then they gotta feel like they are a mom/dad else they won't care and they will screw that kid up one way or the other -- every nice thing the kid gets is one less nice thing the step parent gets. So it sounds to me like bad strategy as well.\n\n(Of course punishing for a B is idiotic. I am not debating that nonsense.)", "I suspect abusiveness too.

He was skipping class and blew off the homework. He was and is smart, but he thought he could just skate by. So our parents grounded him.

I don't think you would appreciate if someone were to physically impose on you and take away your phone for a couple hours either. Why is it okay when it's done to a kid?", "Oh sweetie, it\u2019s not in any way shape or form *her* child other than it being **her husband\u2019s** kid. Yes, he should not have yelled, but if you really think the wife was right in any sense, that\u2019s actually hilarious.", "It\u2019s not her child. She doesn\u2019t make any decisions about him. But you said that that\u2019s because she\u2019s a woman and needs to defer to the man of the house. Which is bull.", "Could mean newly married. Just the girlfriend until an actual marriage so she could still have had time to get in some abuse before the actual marriage. I doubt they waited to live with the son until after they were married!", "It was a punishment. I wasn\u2019t getting a bad grade for lack of trying. It happened to be too hard of a class for me. Instead of recognizing it was too hard for me (the teacher told her I asked him questions constantly in class trying to understand our homework) she just made me do extra work that I was completely getting wrong as well. In theory, it fits the crime. If it really was a lack of studying, it\u2019s still a punishment, just one that teaches the kid to be more diligent.", "Condescension because you can't argue your point.  \nSo if parents adopt a child, it's not theirs?  \nSo the wife has 0 say in anything?", "Now you\u2019re just arguing just to argue. We both arrived at the same conclusion. NTA", "I get that but I honestly think it sounds like they never had a proper discussion on what her role would be based on what he says her response was. Either that or shes delulu. Either way, losing the phone for a couple hours between end of school until dad\u2019s arrival hardly qualifies as abuse. Im honestly shocked at how many people think it\u2019s absolutely fine to yell at your new wife who is also a new stepmom.", "Never said that, but okay. The wife was massively overstepping her limits as a parental figure. If she wanted to parent the kid, she should have acted within the boundaries that are set up. Maybe they didn\u2019t have that conversation, and that\u2019s on OP, but to wildly blame OP for \u201cundermining\u201d someone\u2019s authority that has no actual authority, is stupid and not how parenting works. Step parents (with a general rule when there are two biological parents present) don\u2019t get authority unless in exigent circumstances. Especially when it comes to something **neither** biological parent would do.", "No, I\u2019m not. I have a genuine issue with your saying women need to be put in their places and need to defer to their husbands and can only make small decisions.", "You know, in any other circumstance using force to deprive someone of their property is called robbery. Doesn't matter how long she took his phone away from him. What matters is that she thinks she has power over him. She doesn't. That kid has both biological parents. And even within biological parents there are limits to what can be done to a child... just because someone is a child doesn't mean an adult gets to treat them however they like.\n\nIn this case not only you are the standards completely ir rational she had absolutely no right to impose them.", "So if parents adopt a child, it's not theirs?  \n\nSo the wife has 0 say in anything?", "\u2026.there\u2019s nothing in the story to suggest the step-mother adopted the child?", "Please tell me where there\u2019s anything about adoption in this situation? If you can, I\u2019ll be surprised. This is about **step parents** which are vastly different from *adoptive parents*. So now your argument is meaningless", "So if parents adopt a child, it's not theirs?  \n\nSo the wife has 0 say in anything?", "Parents. See that word in both of them for some reason. Weird. \n\nIt's not you just lack comprehension.", "Nobody adopted anybody here. Stop with your ridiculous straw-manning.", "Uhhhh the comprehension part makes it so you know what *type* of parent they are. You\u2019re making up so many scenarios to be mad about in this thread and it\u2019s honestly very amusing for me to read. Also, thank you for giving me this laugh tonight, I haven\u2019t been able to interact with someone who actually did the epitome of \u201ccorrecting someone incorrectly\u201d"]}
