{"id": 4314, "submission_id": "zgudt6", "title": "AITA for telling my parents that my brother is facing the consequences of his actions and I'll never help him?", "selftext": "My brother is a pathological liar. He has been almost as long as I have known him (it started when he was 7-8 years old). I have been on the other end of his lies more than once. I was two years older so was always supposed to forgive once I'd get an apology from him, which was always forced by our parents. Some of the lies in childhood I was subjected to: that I cheated on one long term girlfriend and slept with her best friend, that I had stolen my best friend's dad's family ring (it was stolen for real but not by me), that I had given him permission to use my locker in school (which our high school did not allow), that I went out with friends when I was home, in my room. The lie that made me cut him out of my life happened when we were 20 and 22. I had just moved in with my then long term girlfriend. She and I had been together for almost 3 years at that point. My brother then told her that I had fathered a child with one of my ex-girlfriend's and that I had abandoned my child so I could get girls easier. She believed him enough that even when she realized she was wrong, the relationship was broken beyond repair.\n\nI told my brother after this that I never wanted to see him again, that he was dead to me and I hoped one day his life would fall apart because of all his sick lies. His response was we were family and I couldn't disown him forever. I told him family are the people you love and how could I love someone like him.\n\nIt's been 15 years since that went down. I got married to my wonderful wife, we have four amazing children together and I have not seen my brother since. I also have a strained relationship with my parents because I do blame them for not taking care of the problem a lot sooner.\n\nSo this is what I know. But I don't really care so some details could be wrong. My brother was married. He lied a lot to his wife and her parents. His wife was sort of aware of what he was like, her parents were not. He and his wife had children together and they lived in a house owned by the wife's parents. His wife died suddenly and some of my brother's lies were exposed. His wife's parents did not want him in their house and kicked him out. They also kept all of his wife's stuff and denied him everything but the clothes he and the kids owned and the kids toys. They offered to raise his children but he refused. Then he lost his job because of lies. My parents took him and the kids in. Now they want us to make up and they want me to help him out. I told him he got what he deserves and now he is facing the consequences of his actions and that I'll never ever help him. I told them he is not my family, his kids are not my family and I am nothing to do with this. They asked how I could turn my back on innocent children.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670584153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgudt6/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_brother_is/", "score": 788, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They knew he had this problem all your life, and they excused him for it. This problem escalated to the point where he is in the situation he is in, And you are disowning him. Since you\u2019re disowning him, preceded his marriage, and all of this mess, the real culpability, for all of this belongs to him and your parents. They chose to keep forgiving, his bad behavior, and his real issue with lying about things to the point where they have arrived at this moment in time. I do feel bad for his kids, because what it must be like to lose a mom and have him as the sole remaining parent with grandparents that are willing to look the other way over. Such agree just behavior. It\u2019s a very sad situation. However, it is not your responsibility.", "Ask your parents how they could turn their back on you when your brother was wrecking your life. That's the same energy you are bringing to this situation. \n\nNTA.", "While I overall vote NTA - you really shouldnt take this out on your nieces/nephews. They are innocent in this (at least until they pick up your brother's corrupt ways). You are a grown man and you do not have to accept anyone into your life that will cause stress or disfunction to you and your family.", "This is tough... Your brother sounds like he straight up sucks, but now there are kids involved and they should be given a better chance, i.e., knowing GOOD family, than just living with this liar of a dad. So a gentle YTA \"because of the children.\"", "NTA. helping out him for the sake of his kids would be charitable, a great deed. It's not an obligation. You've got a perfectly reasonable boundary here.", "NTA, but unfortunately you'll probably never receive recognition from your parents about what your brother did to you or what they allowed him to do,", "I think you're being overdramatic by claiming that what, he'd spend any money on booze and hookers instead of food and clothes for his kids.\n\nBeing a pathological liar does not mean being a malicious person. And before you bring up him ruining OPs relationships in the past, which of us wasn't a complete asshole in our teens?\n\nWhat we know is that he lied to his in laws, this *could* just be to make them like him because they wouldn't otherwise approve \"Yeah sure I'm catholic\", \"Of course I do not drink\" etc...\n\nHe also lied to his job which is a much bigger deal I will not attempt to justify. Too many accidents happen because people who don't know what they're doing end up in positions of power But qgain we don't know details.\n\nFinally he's keeping his kids despite in-laws offering to raise them. Can we blame a widowed father wanting to keep the young kids he had with his dead wife rather than put them into the care of two people who hate him and might very well try to poison them against him?\n\nOP is NTA for not wanting to support her brother but imma say you're Y-TA for making assumptions.", "Exactly! This needs to be emphasized more. The lies brother told were not little white lies, they were enormous deliberately false statements that were negatively life altering for OP. So what lies could brother come up with next? Maybe lies that further jeopardize any relationships OP has? Or his employment? Or maybe an accusatory lie regarding sexual assault of the family children? \n\nI know I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t stick around to find out. OP should go completely NC with his brother and parents to protect himself and his family. This isn\u2019t child\u2019s play and needs to be taken very seriously. \n\nBravo Max-Ear for highlighting this aspect. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "> They asked how I could turn my back on innocent children.\n\nThe irony! Them turning their backs on their own innocent child year after year, lie after lie was what caused this situation in the first place.

The lies that he told were not small ones. Every single one that OP listed were trending towards, \"get someone in trouble/relationship ending\" ones. And he was still pulling that shit into his 20s. And he pulled that on a sibling.\n\nI highly doubt that the grandparents dropped him for lying about something minor. And I doubt his job did either.

I wasn't a complete asshole in my teens, nor was anyone i know. And they certainly didn't tell my girlfriend that i fathered a child that i abandoned....when we were all adults.

One who lied so egregiously that they lost their job, and whose partners parents kicks them and their kids out, with the clothes on their backs, after they just lost their spouse (which would be the spouses parents grandkids, btw). \n\nThis is an absolutely ridiculous take.  I've never met a compulsive/pathological liar who wasn't actively malicious, manipulative or apathetic to the feelings and needs of those around them.   \n\nWhile my experiences are not necessarily universal, it takes a special kind of person to actively risk the relationships in your life to the degree that when your lies come to light, they would rather nuke you, and find you homeless with your children then give you a chance to make amends, and let you find a place to stay first.", "Do you really thinking telling your sibling\u2019s SO that they cheated on them, fathered and abandoned a child with some one else when *that never happened* is just normal teenage AHery?!\n\nEven when sibling relationships are strained, fabricating that kind of fantastical lie doesn\u2019t occur to a normal person.", "This.
