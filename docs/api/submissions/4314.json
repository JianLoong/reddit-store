{"id": 4314, "submission_id": "zgudt6", "title": "AITA for telling my parents that my brother is facing the consequences of his actions and I'll never help him?", "selftext": "My brother is a pathological liar. He has been almost as long as I have known him (it started when he was 7-8 years old). I have been on the other end of his lies more than once. I was two years older so was always supposed to forgive once I'd get an apology from him, which was always forced by our parents. Some of the lies in childhood I was subjected to: that I cheated on one long term girlfriend and slept with her best friend, that I had stolen my best friend's dad's family ring (it was stolen for real but not by me), that I had given him permission to use my locker in school (which our high school did not allow), that I went out with friends when I was home, in my room. The lie that made me cut him out of my life happened when we were 20 and 22. I had just moved in with my then long term girlfriend. She and I had been together for almost 3 years at that point. My brother then told her that I had fathered a child with one of my ex-girlfriend's and that I had abandoned my child so I could get girls easier. She believed him enough that even when she realized she was wrong, the relationship was broken beyond repair.\n\nI told my brother after this that I never wanted to see him again, that he was dead to me and I hoped one day his life would fall apart because of all his sick lies. His response was we were family and I couldn't disown him forever. I told him family are the people you love and how could I love someone like him.\n\nIt's been 15 years since that went down. I got married to my wonderful wife, we have four amazing children together and I have not seen my brother since. I also have a strained relationship with my parents because I do blame them for not taking care of the problem a lot sooner.\n\nSo this is what I know. But I don't really care so some details could be wrong. My brother was married. He lied a lot to his wife and her parents. His wife was sort of aware of what he was like, her parents were not. He and his wife had children together and they lived in a house owned by the wife's parents. His wife died suddenly and some of my brother's lies were exposed. His wife's parents did not want him in their house and kicked him out. They also kept all of his wife's stuff and denied him everything but the clothes he and the kids owned and the kids toys. They offered to raise his children but he refused. Then he lost his job because of lies. My parents took him and the kids in. Now they want us to make up and they want me to help him out. I told him he got what he deserves and now he is facing the consequences of his actions and that I'll never ever help him. I told them he is not my family, his kids are not my family and I am nothing to do with this. They asked how I could turn my back on innocent children.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670584153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgudt6/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_brother_is/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents \"turned their backs\" on a child by enabling your brother to grow up the way he did. (I know there are cases where parents can do everything \"right\" and the child still grows up into an asshole, but in this case, they clearly allowed OP's brother to grow up into a little monster.) They also turned their backs on *you* by trying to force forgiveness. They have some nerve to cry to you about the consequences now.", "NTA. Never. You are not turning your back on innocent children - this is sickening emotional blackmail. Your parents have obviously enabled this behaviour over the years but want you to pay the price for it. They chose to have him but you did not. He is their problem.", "NTA. They're right that the kids are innocent (and look what they have for their sole parent), but he has help from your parents and refused it from his wife's parents, so he's not helpless. I'm sure it's hard for him, especially if he's in the habit of lying when he doesn't like reality, but you're absolutely right that he needs to experience consequences to make him face up to things.", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for those kids, I really do. \n\nBut nothing you can do will help them, because their father comes attached to them and he WILL sabotage even the best of attempts.

Given what they did with you.", "NTA  I do feel sorry for his kids but he made his bed long ago and now its time to sleep in it. You parents as well as they've enabled him all his life.

Those kids are not your responsibility and your parents should know this and be more understanding to the history he put you through.", "NTA. It's unfortunate for the kids that they lost their mother & their dad is a lying asshole, but with two willing sets of grandparents to look after them, they don't need anything from you.

I do feel sorry for them, and personally if I could have a relationship with them without having a relationship with the brother, I personally, would probably try to help them, as they too will probably be victims of his lies in the future.

Your children do not need their Uncle in their lives.", "NTA. Definitely, absolutely, certainly, 100%.\n\nYou are not responsible for the choices he makes and the consequences that have come as a result of them. His children are innocent in all of this so it is your choice whether you wish to meet them or not but you are certainly not obligated to.\n\nYour parents asked you how you could turn your back on innocent children but remember your brothers actions led them into that position in the first place and they also never supported you during all the times your brother caused you trouble. On top of this, his in-laws offered to raise his children for him and he REFUSED knowing full well that he wouldn\u2019t be able to care for them properly.\n\nYou also have your own family now that you need to consider in all of this, how would it affect them if you were to reconnect with your brother?

I don't say to yours because we all know how that turned out.  And when your folks ask you how you can turn your back on innocent children:  \"Well, you certainly found it easy enough, so why don't you tell me before I go total no contact on you.\"", ">   They asked how I could turn my back on innocent children.\n\nThis isn't what's happening. You are protecting innocent children - YOUR innocent children - from a man who has done his best to ruin your life multiple times over and shows no remorse. Try reframing it for your parents. I doubt they'll understand if they haven't by now, but may as well try.\n\nNTA. Take care of yourself and your family.", "NTA. He clearly hasn't changed at all, and letting him back into your life would very likely create the same stress and misery you had before you went no contact. I feel bad for the kids, but it seems like your parents are trying to use them as an 'in' to force you to see your brother, so I think you're absolutely right to set a hard boundary where they're concerned, and not allow either you or them to be used as pawns. \n\nYou also have to protect your own kids from a situation that could very easily hurt them. Imagine if e.g. your brother repeated the lie about you having and abandoning another child in front of them, and they believed it? That kind of thing can mess with anyone's head, let alone a child's.", "NTA. \n\n>They asked how I could turn my back on innocent children.\n\nBy knowing exactly what their dad is capable of.", "NTA\n\nYour brother will find a way without your help.  Tell your parents if they had stepped in and done something about his lies when he was younger, (about the time he was destroying your life and when you asked them to step in) he would not be in this situation now.  Remind them that you made your attempts back then, but they didn't help and he continued to lie and ruin your life.  This is on them and on your brother.  \n\nIf you're feeling particularly evil, you could just lie and tell your brother that you'll help and ghost him.

You are right, that person is Not your family.", "NTA I would've also told them this: you're stuck caring for  brother and his children because you refused to actually deal with the lying when he was a child. You have sone responsibility for the current situation. I refuse to help out because he has a history of targeting me and the people I actually love. I refuse to allow my brother to harm me or my family. I refuse to help two people who never protected me from his malicious behavior.
