{"id": 4314, "submission_id": "zgudt6", "title": "AITA for telling my parents that my brother is facing the consequences of his actions and I'll never help him?", "selftext": "My brother is a pathological liar. He has been almost as long as I have known him (it started when he was 7-8 years old). I have been on the other end of his lies more than once. I was two years older so was always supposed to forgive once I'd get an apology from him, which was always forced by our parents. Some of the lies in childhood I was subjected to: that I cheated on one long term girlfriend and slept with her best friend, that I had stolen my best friend's dad's family ring (it was stolen for real but not by me), that I had given him permission to use my locker in school (which our high school did not allow), that I went out with friends when I was home, in my room. The lie that made me cut him out of my life happened when we were 20 and 22. I had just moved in with my then long term girlfriend. She and I had been together for almost 3 years at that point. My brother then told her that I had fathered a child with one of my ex-girlfriend's and that I had abandoned my child so I could get girls easier. She believed him enough that even when she realized she was wrong, the relationship was broken beyond repair.\n\nI told my brother after this that I never wanted to see him again, that he was dead to me and I hoped one day his life would fall apart because of all his sick lies. His response was we were family and I couldn't disown him forever. I told him family are the people you love and how could I love someone like him.\n\nIt's been 15 years since that went down. I got married to my wonderful wife, we have four amazing children together and I have not seen my brother since. I also have a strained relationship with my parents because I do blame them for not taking care of the problem a lot sooner.\n\nSo this is what I know. But I don't really care so some details could be wrong. My brother was married. He lied a lot to his wife and her parents. His wife was sort of aware of what he was like, her parents were not. He and his wife had children together and they lived in a house owned by the wife's parents. His wife died suddenly and some of my brother's lies were exposed. His wife's parents did not want him in their house and kicked him out. They also kept all of his wife's stuff and denied him everything but the clothes he and the kids owned and the kids toys. They offered to raise his children but he refused. Then he lost his job because of lies. My parents took him and the kids in. Now they want us to make up and they want me to help him out. I told him he got what he deserves and now he is facing the consequences of his actions and that I'll never ever help him. I told them he is not my family, his kids are not my family and I am nothing to do with this. They asked how I could turn my back on innocent children.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670584153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgudt6/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_brother_is/", "score": 4292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. Like it sucks that his kids have to have a father like that but you shouldn\u2019t feel forced to forgive someone that made it a point to try to f up your life.", "NTA", "NTA. Clearly. Your parents should kick him out too. And they and the maternal grandparents should get together and sue him for shared custody of the kids (ie custody shared between the 2 sets of grandparents) because from the sounds of it, your brother is no fit person to be looking after children.", "Your parents are enablers who allowed him to become a monster who ruined his life. It's on them to deal with the consequences. NTA", "NTA, so are your parents taking in Every orphaned child?  Are they donating All their income to help children from broken homes?  Are they offering their roof to Every homeless person with kids?  After all they have just as much relation to this list as you do to the kids they're claiming you're \"turning your back on\".", "As always, the family who are giving you shit for not helping either are volunteering to do all the help themselves, or they get to shut up. \n\nNTA. Stick to your guns.", "NTA. They're not just innocent children. They're a direct tie to someone who significantly overstepped boundaries. This is not your responsibility. The wife's parents offered to take the kids... Why isn't he taking up that offer of help?", "They're his kids. He needs to act like their father and figure his life out. NTA.", "How could you turn your back on innocent children? Easy: not your problem \n\nNTA. Let your parents take care of those children.", "NTA if you want to help the children there are ways:\n\n1. buy them clothes for school\n2. perhaps set up a fund for them for when they become of age\n3. buy them gifts for their birthday and holidays\n4. take them out for family time with your family\n5. let them stay in contact with you (and only them)\n\nIf this is not what your brother or parents have in mind, then you have done your part. You will not be blackmailed into allowing your brother to continue to behave the same way he has always behaved. Those would be my conditions take it or leave it.", "NTA, but if you do feel like caring for the kids, but NOT the father (your brother) help them open a savings account for collage or something like that) that your brother or parent's CANNOT touch!", "They needed to step in when the consequences of his lies affected other people, other relationships. He became so untrustworthy his in-laws didn\u2019t know what to believe anymore, and that is all on him, and the people who enabled him.", ">they clearly allowed OP's brother to grow up into a little monster.\n\nClearly? Where is that clarity written?", "Agreed. People like OPs brother never learn their lessons either so he will literally just go back to how he has always been even if he seems different.", "That, unlike what OP\u2019s brother is capable of, is the truth.", "Even in comment threads, some people insist this is punishment towards the kids.", "If the brother finally hits rock bottom maybe he'll let the kids go live with their mom's parents. They'd be better off there anyway.", "Imagine how the world would be even more of a dumpster fire if people who had kids never had to face the consequences of their actions, \"because they have kids\".", "if he loved the kids he would\u2019ve put them in the care of someone who is capable of caring for them.. and obviously he\u2019s keen on sabotaging relationships and careers, it\u2019s no coincidence or \u201cunknown details\u201d that they all cut him off. he made his bed. and he\u2019s not going to change if he\u2019s grown and pulling the same bs on the people around him", "NTA- you have no obligation to this man. He made his own bed and now he needs to live with it.\n\nThat being said maybe you should help the kids. But help the kids get a stable home away from deadbeat, liar brother and his complacent, coddling parents using the children as bargaining chips to guilt trip help.\n\nthe best thing to do would be help the grandparents get custody of the children (be a character witness, maybe help them with legal bills if possible exc.)\n\nThis way the kids have a safe, stable home environment and then your parents can deal with their own little mistake.\n\nThe kids are innocent and don\u2019t deserve to be caught up in this and it would seem deadbeat dad and his enablers just see the kids as a way to goad others into helping deadbeat still by trading on their need.\n\nThey\u2019re nothing but pawns being used to once more get loser bro out of the trouble he created.", "The liar brother chose not to take the option because it excluded himself.  Like \"No, you can't help my kids without helping me\".", "I know a pathy, he was my business partner.  at some point he was so deluded he would tell me he invented facebook and mark zuckerberg stole his idea.  like bro, that's literally the plot of an actual movie.  pathological liars know no bounds", "I wonder what his wife's cause of death was.", "In no way is that comment doing that.\n\nGiving \u00a3100 to the next homeless person you see would be charitable and a great deed - who is being made to feel guilty by the stating of that fact?", "I would do it because it\u2019s a total win for me.\n\nLet\u2019s be serious -he\u2019s not gonna go to therapy.  The options of him accepting that are minuscule.  But - you show your parents you are willing to help him get out of the situation by addressing the core problem.  The core problem is not that OP is not in his brothers life, it\u2019s that he\u2019s a pathological liar.\n\nOn the off chance he does actually accept it, I improve the quality of life for my parents, and as a bi-product, some kids I\u2019ve never met.\n\nAs much as I would blame my parents for enabling him, they are still my parents, and while I would have washed my hands of the situation 15 years ago, they are still dealing with the stress of it.  Which sucks.", "**psychopaths are born, sociopaths are made.**\n\nThese days it's all part of the antisocial personality disorder spectrum, and it was never as simple as born vs made anyway. Rather it's a combination of various innate and experienced factors that result in someone being somewhere on the ASPD spectrum. I know when you google it you can still pull up several sources on the psychopaths born; sociopaths made theory, but it really is becoming outdated. Still I think your own thought process (part of a larger profile) is on the right track.", "Not to mention that OP is married with children of his own, and his brother has been completely content to nuke a relationship OP has had on whim... I am worried that if OP even tries to be part of the kids lives, he will have social services banging on his door with a cop, ready to haul him away for made up shit his brother said.", "True true. I used the statement, even though it\u2019s a vast oversimplification, to illustrate my point that the parents are complicit in bro\u2019s behavior.", "No....he said it right the first time.   Psychopaths are born, sociopaths are made.  Both are basically the same except there's an additional environmental factor in child development in sociopaths that differentiates them from psychopaths, who are born with an underdeveloped part of the brain, specifically the pre-frontal lobe.", "Ah okay, that makes sense.", "Except that that's outdated now and it's all considered to be on the antisocial personality disorder spectrum, with what we've called a pyschopath being on the severe end. But even then, it's not just pure nature that's the cause or trigger.", "I mean... she married him.", "Ramen"]}
