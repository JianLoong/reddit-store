You should be making sure you are out by 10pm. Set an alarm on your phone or watch to make sure you start cleaning up on time to be out the door BY 10pm. You knew when closing time was. You stayed past it. People have to check on alarms to be sure they are false alarms, so yeah places get charged. You caused the false alarms so you are responsible!", "YTA\n\n\nSo you knew when you had to leave, but...just didn't?You also knew that it would cause an alarm to go off. \n\n\nYou're in breach of contract, that often carries penalties. \n\n\nTwice in a week is 100% avoidable.

It would have been completely fair to give you a fee if he'd mentioned it, but he didn't, and that's on him.\n\nEdit to clarify: **It's illegal for him, as a business owner, to charge you a fee that was in no way disclosed to you and you did not agree to.** He was aware that he'd be penalized for a 'false alarm', as is evident by him stating what he 'usually' charges for it, so he can't claim it was a surprise to him or a unique circumstance. He can very much kick you out if you refuse to pay, so keep that in mind, but he can't actually force you to pay it.", "ESH.   \nThe owner should be clear about the cost as it's a perfectly reasonable position that he has, and legally he should spell it out.  \nYou didn't realise the cost to the owner of breaking the rules, but you broke the rules and need to accept some consequence for that.

You must have known that the alarm would be a huge inconvenience to someone, yet you did it anyway. That you didn't know there was a monetary cost involved, or that you'd have to pay it, is kind of irrelevant. You disrespected the rules and made a problem for someone else. Now you pay the price.

Be responsible for you actions", "Because the question clearly states \"are you the AH for not paying the fine that you didn't know about\" I'm going with NTA. I do think that it's shitty to stay past 10 if you know there's an auto alarm in place. But if you didn't know there'd be an outrageous fine, you shouldn't be told to pay it. It's kind to try to clean up and keep things neat and tidy but not if it means you're leaving past the time allowed. I would not pay these fines, no matter how much I make.", "YTA. As a small biz owner myself, I\u2019ll tell you that false alarm charges are very real. The fact that it wasn\u2019t in the agreement doesn\u2019t matter. Is there language in the agreement that says if you kick a hole in the wall you pay? What about breaking a window? Or setting a fire? It should be assumed by adults that if your carelessness costs the business money, then you\u2019re on the hook for that money. Common sense like that doesn\u2019t need to be delineated in a written agreement. I\u2019m guessing the agreement doesn\u2019t say anything about washing your hands after you pee either? They probably just assume that, as adults, you don\u2019t need to be told some things. \n\nPlease stop trying to gaslight a small business owner, and just pay the fine that your selfishness caused to be levied.", "Sorry but yes YTA for not paying.  Next time, set an alarm on your phone for 9:30, and aim to be out by 9:45.\n\nTo be fair, the owner could also set the alarm back to 10:05 or 10:10,  but the rules currently state alarm at 10:00, so you should prepare for that.", "Yta\n\nWhy is a fee enough to make you respect the time limits and not just him telling you? You disrespected his rules twice and cost him hefty fines, it makes complete sense that you\u2019d at least pay half (he\u2019s being very generous imo by only charging you half).", "NTA\n\nI wouldnt pay.\n\nBut if I was the owner I would probably rescind your use of the studio for disregarding the rules so blatantly", "NTA at all. If it wasn\u2019t in writing, it is unreasonable that he would expect you to pay any of the fees. Different if you knew about it, but it wasn\u2019t communicated to you at all so \u2026 NTA at all. Should be a lesson for him as a business owner to get things in writing. And it was so low of him to play the \u201cyou make more than me\u201d card. If that was such a big concern to him, he would have the fees clearly stated in the contract so he wouldn\u2019t have ever run the risk of having to pay for the fees out of his own pocket.", "YTA, it's quite simple you are in the wrong and you try to dispute it and make someone bear a cost caused by you. He is using the wrong words, he cannot fine you, he is just demanding payment of a cost unduly caused by you by not following the clear rules you agreed to, ie, you broke an agreement, you caused damages by breaking that agreement, and you 1/ are refusing to make the other parry whole and 2/ act entitled", "This rings familiarly as people who think it's ok to walk into a restaurant 15 minutes before close and pretend they aren't TA for staying 15 minutes after closing.\n\nYTA.", "YTA for not being out by the agreed upon time of 10pm.\n\nNTA for agreeing to pay $125 as you had not been informed by anyone that such a fee would occur if you were over time.\n\nThe centre needs to place signs or add to centre info that such penalties will be incurred.", "NTA\n\nAt least for the specific point in the title. You kind of are for staying after the lights went off. \n\nIf he intends to charge then he needs to make this clear in the agreement.", "YTA just because you did it twice in a week.

He knows he is fucked by not telling anyone about the fine and is trying to wrongfully put the blame on you. Not only this is unethical but I'm sure illegal too. \nIf possible try looking into it on a legal perspective and document everything. If he forces the fines it would be better to have your ass covered properly.\n\nP.s. don't break rules so recklessly. They were made to be followed.

You should pay the full amount for being such an entitled human, it shouldn't take someone telling you it will cost you money to do the right thing, you should just do it because you agreed to in exchange for someone allowing you access to their space.", "Legally you are probably in the clear.  But are you TA? Yeah, YTA.  Dude's email to you makes this point pretty clearly.

We keep to ourselves and are pretty respectful of the place because we genuinely care about the community, which the studio emphasizes a lot.\n\nWhen you sign up for the studio, you\u2019re given a Community Agreement. During onboarding and in the agreement itself, it says the place closes by 10pm, the lights auto shut off, and there\u2019s an alarm in place that will activate shortly after the lights go off. \n\nMy friend had a flight back home for the holidays earlier this week, so she was at the studio last week trying to finish up pieces she was going to gift. On Thursday, I finished cleaning my own station by around 9:45pm, so I helped her clean and we accidentally stayed a little longer but definitely not past 10:10pm. We also lost track of time since the clock on the wall was 5 minutes behind schedule.\n\nOn Saturday, the same thing occurred. I want to note that we can literally be seen rushing to clean and to leave. We get an email later from the owner stating: \u201cI am writing to inform you that you twice this week set off the alarm. This is a $125 fee on first occurrence and $250 on second. I did not have time to let invoice you or notify you on the first alarm so I am just charging the $125 for the second as well.\u201d  \n\nWe were taken aback because this alarm fee was never mentioned at all (neither in writing nor verbally). We email back apologizing and disputing the fee, and note that had we known about the fee, we would\u2019ve prioritized leaving over cleaning up (our mess and sometimes other people\u2019s) so thoroughly. In his response, the owner admits that he\u2019s never mentioned the fee before and tells us that the city charges him $250 per false alarm and he only charges members half (which is inconsistent with what he said earlier). In subsequent emails he lists criminal offenses, such as stealing and vandalism, and states \u201cIf someone did something to you, knowingly or unknowingly, that caused you financial damages, you would let them know about it, and they would pay for it.\u201d And then he ends the email saying \"it should not require financial consequences to justify respecting me and all the rules of the space, rather than the ones you believe to be most important, like cleanliness. You both make a higher salary than I do if you're making at least minimum wage, please do not other me in your mind because you have an assumption of who I am.\u201d\n\nWe tell him that the most we\u2019re willing to pay is $125, since had we known about the first offense, we would not have repeated the situation. His last email demands us to pay and accuses us of criminally trespassing. Are we the assholes for refusing to pay?\n\nTLDR: We got fined $250 for setting off a false alarm twice in the past week at a studio we\u2019re a member of. The fee was never mentioned in writing or verbally, which the owner admits himself. The owner forgot to fine us the first time it happened. Are we the assholes for refusing to pay?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It should be in the contract and you have to talk to a local lawyer to see if they can force you to pay without having notified you in your area.\n\nMost places should have had to warn you in advance for it to be enforceable but idk if that's everywhere.\n\nEdit: not giving a verdict because the rules were clearly stated though the consequences were not. Also because he as the owner should make it preventable by making sure people are out at say 9:30pm due to the fact of stragglers can happen for various reasons.", "This is less a fee, and more just paying for the cost incurred by you bit following the rules.\n\nIf you had not been a member, and then somehow got in to the place after 10pm, triggering the alarm, would you then object to paying for the false alarm?", "NTA. If the fee has not been previously mentioned you have no obligation to pay it. You will likely be barred from returning however. To all those commenting that Y T A, I disagree since you were trying conscientiously to clean up after yourselves an others.

The owner should have communicated to you the fees ahead of time, in the contract, it\u2019s bonkers that he didn\u2019t and yet expects you to pay.

He should have warned you the first time, even via email and without the invoice. You should only pay 125.", "YTA. Yes, the owner should\u2019ve also told you about the fine, but he was talking to adults who he probably assumed knew \u201cthe alarms activate at 10\u201d meant that being there after that would mess with said alarms. What did you think would happen once you knew up were there after the alarms were set?\n\nSorry but my work has an alarm system that gets tripped outside of certain times.

Or if this was going to happen more than once, contact the owner and ask if the alarm could be set later on that occasion?\n\nThis likely isn\u2019t a fine imposed by the owner, it\u2019ll be from whoever has to deal with the alarms. Those people are probably busy enough dealing with actual alarms from break ins. They don\u2019t want to be rushing out for two people with poor time-management skills.

We keep to ourselves and are pretty respectful of the place because we genuinely care about the community, which the studio emphasizes a lot.\n\nWhen you sign up for the studio, you\u2019re given a Community Agreement. During onboarding and in the agreement itself, it says the place closes by 10pm, the lights auto shut off, and there\u2019s an alarm in place that will activate shortly after the lights go off.\n\nMy friend had a flight back home for the holidays earlier this week, so she was at the studio last week trying to finish up pieces she was going to gift. On Thursday, I finished cleaning my own station by around 9:45pm, so I helped her clean and we accidentally stayed a little longer but definitely not past 10:10pm. We also lost track of time since the clock on the wall was 5 minutes behind schedule.\n\nOn Saturday, the same thing occurred. I want to note that we can literally be seen rushing to clean and to leave. We get an email later from the owner stating: \u201cI am writing to inform you that you twice this week set off the alarm. This is a $125 fee on first occurrence and $250 on second. I did not have time to let invoice you or notify you on the first alarm so I am just charging the $125 for the second as well.\u201d\n\nWe were taken aback because this alarm fee was never mentioned at all (neither in writing nor verbally). We email back apologizing and disputing the fee, and note that had we known about the fee, we would\u2019ve prioritized leaving over cleaning up (our mess and sometimes other people\u2019s) so thoroughly. In his response, the owner admits that he\u2019s never mentioned the fee before and tells us that the city charges him $250 per false alarm and he only charges members half (which is inconsistent with what he said earlier). In subsequent emails he lists criminal offenses, such as stealing and vandalism, and states \u201cIf someone did something to you, knowingly or unknowingly, that caused you financial damages, you would let them know about it, and they would pay for it.\u201d And then he ends the email saying \"it should not require financial consequences to justify respecting me and all the rules of the space, rather than the ones you believe to be most important, like cleanliness. You both make a higher salary than I do if you're making at least minimum wage, please do not other me in your mind because you have an assumption of who I am.\u201d\n\nWe tell him that the most we\u2019re willing to pay is $125, since had we known about the first offense, we would not have repeated the situation. His last email demands us to pay and accuses us of criminally trespassing. Are we the assholes for refusing to pay?\n\nTLDR: We got fined $250 for setting off a false alarm twice in the past week at a studio we\u2019re a member of.
