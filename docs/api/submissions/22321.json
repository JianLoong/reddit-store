Go no-contact with you and never let you see your grandkids. Sure it's your right to remarry but your kids don't have to like it. ESH", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your kids are having a hard time with it. Maybe you guys can try family therapy (you and the kids. I wouldn\u2019t involve the new guy or the ex)", "ESH. You sound entitled. The kids sound like they\u2019re a hot mess and your ex sounds the same. I feel very sorry for your next husband because if you go through with this without fixing some issues he\u2019s going to go through hell. The resentments are just going to fester and you\u2019re willing to let that happen.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your kids are having a hard time with it.

I lived this.", "You gave up, on a lifelong commitment, over something so small. YTA and I'm glad you're kids realize that.", "YTA - poor phrasing, etc.  \n\nNothing they can do about it?  You mean they can't decline to attend, decline to meet your new SO, decline to remain in contact with you?  \n\nThat was a very poor choice of words on your part.", "NTA, *however*\n\n1. Set the wedding date for after your 17 year old is both 18 and will have graduated high school. That way they won't have to live with you and your husband causing everyone a bunch of unnecessary stress. I'm not saying kick them out, just have them be old enough to have the option to leave if they don't like it. \n2. Go back and talk to each kid one on one in private (not a restaurant) when you have plenty of time. I know it's really hard, but lead with empathy. Validate their feelings without arguing or judgment. Let them vent. Start off the conversation by saying something like \"I know you were really upset about my engagement, and I admit I got pretty upset too and was defensive. I was hoping we could try again, I want to listen to your feelings.\" You can ask and validate with things like \"Are you worried about how this will impact your Dad?\" and \"It must have been really scary when he disappeared after the divorce,\" etc. You can also ask them \"are you worried about how this will impact you?\" And \"You don't want to live with \\[fianc\u00e9\\], do you? You probably feel like I'm forcing another big change on you and you are going to lose the home you were used to all over again.\"\n\nDo not defend any of your actions during this part of the conversation. Do not insist you will get married anyway. Try to let them do most of the talking if you can. Just listen, and validate. Show genuine compassion. Don't worry about punishing them or correcting them. Once they feel completely heard and validated, they are going to be more likely to be receptive to your feelings. Also recognize it's a lot harder to argue with someone who is not disagreeing with you. When you don't argue back, and agree with what you can or at least show you understand and care about how it makes them feel (without saying those feelings are wrong), people tend to have a harder time staying as angry. \n\nThen, once they are completely done with their part, share your feelings. Do not blame them. Use \"I feel\" language. (Not \"you don't care about me!\" but \"when you do x, it makes me feel like you don't care about me.\") Tell them you love them very much and you are sorry that the divorce was so hard on them. That's something you regret. You can even say you were sad it was so hard on their father, that you never wanted to see him suffer. However, your marriage to their father was hard on you. You were very unhappy, you just tried to hide it from them beacuse you wanted to protect them. Their Dad wasn't the only one who was sad and struggling, and you felt like you had no one to support you. You tried to be strong for the kids but it was very hard. You worked hard for them to take care of them while their Dad was gone, even though you were sad too, beacuse someone had to be there for the kids. You tried to show you loved them by showing up every day, taking them to school, cooking meals, sweeping floors, making dinner, and doing all the work that isn't fun but that you want to see them well taken care of. Say the reason you dated again is beacuse you were sad and lonely, and have been lonely and had felt that way for many reason. That \\[fianc\u00e9\\] is the person in your life who seems to care about your feelings and want you to be happy. That you're sad beacuse your kid's reaction makes you feel like they don't care about you being happy. You know they are good people with good hearts, and you trust them to come around. You don't expect them to love fianc\u00e9, see him as a Dad, or even have to be his friend. You will wait a year until youngest is 18 and graduated before getting married so they aren't forced to hang around and live with \\[fianc\u00e9\\]. But you hope that in time they will understand and accept this as you looking care of your own mental health. They are becoming adults and they won't be home to keep you company forever. \n\nOr, whatever you want to tell them? Note instead of telling them how selfish or ungrateful or whatever they are, you tell them you know they have good hearts and you trust they will understand in time. That you know this is big and emotionally difficult news for them, and it's okay if they need time to processes it. Instead of saying \"there is nothing they can do about it,\" you'd tell them something like \"I'm still planning on getting married. Just like I respect that you are an adult/soon will be an adult who is able to choose your own partner, I hope you can respect the same for me. I will always listen to your opinions and if you have any concerns about fianc\u00e9 you can tell me.

I was hoping they would be happy for me, I expect a little disappointment not what happened.", "One important thing to accept about therapy is that it is not a cure all. If the kids are not ready to hear, listen, or accept that their mother made the correct choice for herself and the family, therapy is beating a dead horse until they are ready.", "She tried counseling and the ex never showed", "Most condescending shit ever. How about you talk about how the father disappeared for half a year? Moron.", "This is the right answer. Yes, you absolutely should have gotten yourself out of a bad situation, but it also sounds like you went from being taken advantage of to just taking others for granted.\n\nFor example, it sounds like you dated this guy for a year before you bothered to introduce the kids to him (you say you dated for two years and introduced kids to him a year ago). I understand and appreciate that you wouldn't introduce kids to each person you went on a date with, but a year+ is a long time to keep the kids out of the loop.\n\nGood for your for taking control of your life and getting out of a bad situation, but it really just sounds like you didn't take the time/effort to bring the kids along with you.\n\nEdit to ad: I have experience from my youth of being a child to a single parent who is dating. My mother went on the other side of the extreme, of introducing way too early. But, for me a year is still way too long.

It was a dinner to announce that they were, in fact, going to be married. They've been dating for years, and OP was cautious when introducing them. I don't believe someone with that self-control would dump marriage on their kids without any preamble, at a restaurant, for the first time.", "Umm, what? They're old enough to not throw a tantrum in public area. It's not like the mother was threatening their safety or something, they aren't entitled to a meltdown just because it's not the news they wanted.", "They hate the man for no reason.

They prefer her being miserable for their own comfort...", "Never unless my ex changes, he will only have them for a few days at most before he kicked them out.

They deserve happiness and not everything is about you. I\u2019m 24 and have been in a very similar situation. My mom left my dad because he was a jerk. He attempted suicide and I got to see the bloody aftermath with my own eyes. I would never blame my mom for that. He made his own choices. My mom is a person. Not just a mother and so is yours.

Kids should never be expected to be happy when their parent remarries. I imagine that feeling is pretty rare. They probably harbored irrational hopes of you guys getting back together. I'm sure it was devastating for them. You're getting married and that's fantastic. It can be all about you and your joy and your big day with your friends, your spouse, your family, etc. But not with your kids.", "I understand that therapy is not a silver bullet/cure all.  Which is why I suggested therapy as a safe place for them all to express and process there feelings.   Nothing more.

You are biased against the dad. The first thing out of any Redditor comments is that it must be the dads fault. He must of manipulated them. The mom couldn't possibly just be a shitty person. It has to be the dad using Yoda mind tricks on them. \n\nBeing depressed because the love of your life left you isn't manipulative.  Not going to therapy with the woman who tore your life apart isn't manipulative.  The kids have had years since the divorce and lived with their mom their whole life. I'm pretty sure they have a pretty good feel on what is actually going on in their lives. The OP came here trying to find people like you to sympathize with her that her kids are unreasonable.  At 28 and 19 years old, they are probably the only reasonable people in that family. OP needs to look in the mirror and figure out how her approach and attitudes are alienating her own children."]}
