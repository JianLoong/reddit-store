When she and her fiance started planning things a few weeks ago, they said it was gonna be no kids. I didn't think anything of that at first, I assumed she meant like 13+ or something like that. That was weird though, because she never came to me about anything wedding related like she did with the rest of the family.\n\nSo last week, I asked her if she needed help with anything, and asked if she wanted me wearing a specific dress or something like that. She said no, why would I? I'm not going. She explained that no kids means no kids, no exceptions, so I'm too young by three months to attend.\n\nI was really hurt by that, and told our parents. They didn't know I wasn't invited, so my dad told her either she lets me come or she's not getting their half of the money. She did invite me, but she made a big show of how she didn't want me there.\n\nSo I said screw it, don't bother. Since she doesn't want me there I won't be, she just shouldn't expect things to go back to normal after. We used to be really close, and we text a lot even after she moved out. Not anymore though, I blocked her on everything and I'm not speaking to her. IDK if our relationship can recover from this, but if we do it's gonna be up to her to fix it.

I understand child-free weddings, but I truly do not understand why she wouldn't invite her sister if you really were that close. She's having the best day of her life and is actively telling you you can't be part of it, and can only begrudgingly come because she won't get money if you couldn't. That's selfish and greedy.\n\nIs there any reason to consider her fiancee talked her into not making an exception for you?", "NTA. Strict 18 cutoffs for a wedding get ridiculous at certain points, and this is a strong illustration--you were close sisters and she knew you were just as \"adult\" as you'd be in three months; this isn't some question of a cousin whose 17 and she just didn't know how mature they'd be.", "NTA\n\nMy sister had a no kids wedding when I was like 15/16 and she made the the maid of honor.

The hurt is not absolved just because she was forced to thrown you an invite. Don\u2019t go, and tell any family members who ask the truth about why. \n\nAlso, what a horrible thing to do to your own sibling.

You\u2019re 17. You\u2019re not exactly a child, it\u2019s not like she has to worry about you running around and getting food on the walls or anything or interrupting the first dance, and then she only invited you due to financial repercussions.

Pretty much shows how little she values your relationship. I\u2019m really sorry. Must be painful.", "NTA, what a horrible thing to do to an immediate family member.", "NTA. That\u2019s really shit, to say your 17 year old sister can\u2019t come to your wedding, yeah if I was you I wouldn\u2019t feel like going either, your parents are wrong to be trying to sweep it under the carpet.", "NTA you\u2019re reaction is pretty normal in my opinion. She don\u2019t invite you due to a stupid rule (who put a 17 years old in the same basket as kids?) and then invited you because of money.\n\nThere\u2019s no respect coming from her and it\u2019s up to you to decide how you feel about it.", "NTA.

Your sister will forever be the one who didn\u2019t want you at her wedding.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s heartbreaking. I couldn\u2019t imagine not having my 17 year old sister at my wedding. She\u2019d be the first person I\u2019d invite! Hell she\u2019d be my maid of honor. I don\u2019t know how she could possibly make it up to you. That\u2019s so hurtful", "I wouldn\u2019t want to go either if I knew that I wasn\u2019t actually invited and would be there only because my sister wanted the money from our dad.

Your whole family is going to to be there (just no kids) and because you\u2019re just three months shy of it she didn\u2019t invite you? That\u2019s cruel.", "NTA. I would skip it and tell her you attended her next one. I read somewhere that like 60% of people who get married between ages 20-25 end up getting divorced. Odds are, she\u2019ll end up divorced in a few years anyway.", "NTA. \u201cNo kids\u201d should not include 17 year olds lmao. Especially not someone who is almost 18. The vast majority of child free weddings do not exclude older teens.  Especially when the older teen is a sibling.\n\nShe made her idiotic bed, now she has to lay in it. I can\u2019t believe she wouldn\u2019t invite you just because you\u2019re 17. She\u2019s insane if she thinks that\u2019s a standard \u201cchild free wedding\u201d thing to do. You\u2019re her sister for crying out loud. \n\nFeels like a flimsy excuse to not invite you. Is there anything else going on?", "NTA-This is the correct response, people need to be responsible for their actions. Who wants someone who cares do little for you in their life?!", "NTA. She was being absolutely ridiculous and if she doesn't see why you're upset and not acting buddy-buddy, then she's really dense.", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t get past the fact that you will be closer to 18 than not since she told you that you missed the cutoff by 3 months.

This is her day, and I am respecting her wishes. She\u2019s made it clear, even in the invite she was forced to give. I want her to have the day she wants, and that does not include me. That is not being dramatic, it is what she said. I, however, don\u2019t have to allow her the access to me to hurt my feelings. Because no matter what I know my sister do not want me at this big life event.\u201d\n\nI am truly so sorry. Wedding planning brings out the worst in others.\n\nYour sister made a choice, so you also have the option to do what best for you. You have nothing to be sorry about.", "Nta. Who doesn\u2019t have ALL the immediate family on top of the guest list ffs?", "NTA.  \n\nIt's her wedding.  If she doesn't want you there that says a lot.  She's not entitled to any sort of relationship with you after making it clear you mean that little to her.", "NTA and I am so so sorry you experienced this. It\u2019s so hurtful and I think you have amazing boundaries for someone so young.", "Another AITA with people ready to burn briges with family just for a \"child free\" party. NTA", "NTA. She didn't want you there (for whatever ridicolous reasoning) and you're just complying with her wishes.", "NTA\n\nIt was her choice to exclude you, and she's hiding behind an arbitrary rule that she made up in the first place. \n\nShe needs to sincerely apologize before any kind of communication from you.", "NTA. That\u2019s terrible. The whole \u2018No kids\u2019 thing is always kind of controversial and hurtful even when it\u2019s little cousins and whatnot. But to apply it to a 17 year old sibling? I would be hurt too.", "NTA. i understand wanting a child-free wedding, but that usually doesn\u2019t include your 3 months away from being 18 years old little sister who you\u2019re supposed to be so close to. and if she invited you while still complaining about not wanting you there, i definitely wouldn\u2019t change my mind about not going.", "Even if I m having a child-free wedding, I would make exceptions for family.

Yeah he was the only kid there but he was my brother.", "NTA! I don't know what it is with some of these brides, but the ridiculousness is just overwhelming. I have a sister like that. 6 years older than me, and she still sees LIFE as a competition. She HAD to get married and have kids, but not just a couple! Oh no, she needed to have the MOST kids out of the rest of my siblings (she only \"tied\" with my other sister, with 4 kids), because that made her \"special\" or somehow got her \"points\" for...life, or something? She then had this uppity attitude about being \"a woman now\" because she's married (a.k.a. she had sex. Big whoop. \ud83d\ude44), and *I* was still a *child!* \n\nYeah... she has 4 kids and is currently separated from her husband on the way to divorce. \n\nMeanwhile she's MAD that I had the *audacity* to get married after turning 30, adopt a child, or get pregnant & have a baby (she never thought I would do ANY of those things, let alone ALL of them!). She has yet to acknowledge my husband or kids and hasn't spoken to us directly since the wedding, which was 6 years ago. Oh, and she's an Essential Oil MLM hun to boot! \ud83e\udd23 Yeah, no. I would NOT want her life!", "NTA OP\u2019s sister is shady. The parents are wearing blinders!

I\u2019m close with my siblings, so maybe I just can\u2019t wrap my head around that ever being an option.", "Absolutely wild. I'm usually on team 'people don't owe you an exception' but in this case she absolutely owes her sister an exception.", "Yeah our child free wedding had a 16 year old at it, it\u2019s mostly baby free", "I don't think child free ever meant you own siblings. I think it would be crazy to not let op come even if she was 7 years old.", "Why on earth would a sister who is close to the bride be excluded from her wedding because she isn't legally an adult for another *three months*? Unless she was dead set on some location that was strictly 18+? Even then, it's not cool.\n\nNo kids weddings means that you want to be able to party, speak openly, etc without young kids running around. And it usually doesn't apply to family anyway. But certainly not to a teenager.\n\nIt really doesn't matter how she handled letting her know. It's absurd.\n\nNTA", "Child free weddings are one thing, but like...do siblings have weddings and not invite their little siblings because they are under 18?\n\nI always thought it just meant for like extended family and friends. It never would occur to me not to invite a younger sibling. \n\nPeople just suck.", "I\u2019m 40 and to me childfree wedding is exactly what OP was thinking, no one under 13. A teenager can understand the importance of events and if they don\u2019t want to can still sit silently if needs be. The sister is a major AH here.", "Agreed. NTA. I don\u2019t blame you for being hurt OP. The way this was handled was poorly done.", "I am USA and was at a wedding not that long ago, there was a cash bar and the bartender made it his job to card people.

Likely the no kids/specifically excuding you was to appease the husband.", "Fuck em. NTA", "Just be prepared to hold your ground.\nIf you both were close, it will likely hurt you more than her (initially at least), since she now has a new \"bestie\" (husband) to keep her focus, while also likely to shift blame to you (so it's easier for her life).\nIt may take many years... Unless - you ensure the rest of the family knows she pushed you away.  Only if she can't hide from it - will she address it internally.  Or you may be waiting till the relationship has issues - and she then wants to reach out to you.", "If she feels bad but hasn\u2019t done anything about it that\u2019s worse. She KNOWS this is wrong but sh is prioritizing something else.\n\nI believe in forgiveness, even for people who don\u2019t deserve it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you allow someone to abuse you. This is emotional abuse, and your parents need to know that your heart matters.", "Ngl I\u2019m pretty petty", "This is the point right here. There seems to be a missing puzzle piece because this doesn\u2019t track.  The OP felt that they were close even after bridezilla moved out. Based off of this you\u2019d assume she would be part of the wedding party in some aspect particularly a actual bridesmaid. \n\nSounds like the OP thought she would be in the wedding as well because she asked if she was supposed to be wearing a special dress. Imagine the punch in her gut feeling she had when she found out not only was she not in the wedding she wasn\u2019t even invited.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t make sense to me at all. Why such a vast difference in the relationship status. And why is bridezilla being so suspish about this? Not even telling her parents this? Bridezilla was trying to not have any sort of confrontation by saying no children and was going to leave it at that luckily the OP called her out.\n\nAlso\u2026I strongly dislike when parents tell their adult woman \u201cchildren\u201d that they are overreacting. It\u2019s dismissive of their feelings and her actions and invalidates the OP and makes her question her actions so in a sense it\u2019s gaslighting her. She had to come here to make sure what she did was OK because everyone saying she\u2019s overreacting. No, over reacting simply acting. Actions have consequences and  bridezilla chose not to invite her sister and didn\u2019t tell her. And only broke down and  invited her when daddy threatened to pull funding (could you *IMAGINE* how hurtful that would be? I have sisters and I feel that in my soul) Her sister acted by going NC and blocking her on all social media that\u2019s a mature boundary she set. She didn\u2019t put her sister on blast she simply said I\u2019m done.\n\nAhhh wedding season.

But not to be invited to a wedding is another thing.", "Lol My son's girlfriend is 24 and she's feeling like that's way too young to get married, and she thinks anyone who would ask her is an idiot.", "I would let them know before the wedding what happened.", "She should let everyone know this before the wedding, rather than try to do damage control after.", "It would have been hilarious if they had not invited you and all the family and friends saw you at the same resort. \"Why didn't we see you at the wedding?\"\n\n\"Oh, we were not invited'.", "We had a similar thing with my cousin's wedding but didn't get the deliciousness yours ended with.\n\nCousin said she was having a kid free wedding which we all totally understood, but it actually included all of us cousins, only two of whom could be considered kids at the time - I'm a year older than said cousin and I was in my late 20's. The reality ended up being that there were kids there too, on the groom's side, and a few kids from selected family members on her side.\n\nThe \"kid free\" aspect was just a \"nice\" way to exclude most of her family.

The Bridezilla and her family would be fending off questions about why OP wasn't there.  \n\nI agree with OP that she doesn't have to attend and I would likely not if I were in her place.  Let the Bridezilla lie about it.  OP can explain if anyone asks.", "Exactly when is this not the case?", "My wedding was \"child free\" but we had the exception of nieces and nephews. So I guess not that child free as all these posts recently. But the the 5 children at my wedding were all kids that I actively saw at parties regularly and were in the bridal procession as flower girls/ring bearer. And I am child free personally and don't really know how to interact with my young nephews \ud83d\ude04.

But I agree with everything", "Sometimes it's a cost thing tbh. We couldn't afford to have my husband's dozen of cousins AND their multiple children at our wedding. Would've racked up the wedding food cost waaaaaay fast, since price is calculated per head. So we had a no kids rule. Most of them I'd never even met, and none of them were gonna be heart-broken about not attending a grown-up event full of people they didn't know. It was either this or not invite people we \\*actually\\* wanted to invite, like our friends. Screw that.\n\nTo circle back to the OG post though: even we made exceptions for my kid sister and hubby's kid nephew whom he's close with. Sister not inviting OP is wild.", "We literally dragged my wife\u2019s much younger sister to each of the bars stations and said do not serve before the reception started. It was honestly a good laugh. She was the only one underage.", "Yes, she'll be over 18 by then!", "I remember people called OP an asshole for questioning it bc the person holding the wedding \u201ccan do whatever they want\u201d.

I'm not even particularly close with any of them, but 29 years later, it makes me happy they were there. Of course, the most controversial thing that happened at my wedding was that I said \"shit\" when my wife smeared me with cake. Two year-olds B and D were right there, and so was 95 year-old great grandma.
