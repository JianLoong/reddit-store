{"id": 16694, "submission_id": "13bsnxd", "title": "AITA for not attending my sisters wedding after she almost didn't invite me because I'm under 18?", "selftext": "My (17F) sister (24F) is getting married in the fall. When she and her fiance started planning things a few weeks ago, they said it was gonna be no kids. I didn't think anything of that at first, I assumed she meant like 13+ or something like that. That was weird though, because she never came to me about anything wedding related like she did with the rest of the family.\n\nSo last week, I asked her if she needed help with anything, and asked if she wanted me wearing a specific dress or something like that. She said no, why would I? I'm not going. She explained that no kids means no kids, no exceptions, so I'm too young by three months to attend.\n\nI was really hurt by that, and told our parents. They didn't know I wasn't invited, so my dad told her either she lets me come or she's not getting their half of the money. She did invite me, but she made a big show of how she didn't want me there.\n\nSo I said screw it, don't bother. Since she doesn't want me there I won't be, she just shouldn't expect things to go back to normal after. We used to be really close, and we text a lot even after she moved out. Not anymore though, I blocked her on everything and I'm not speaking to her. IDK if our relationship can recover from this, but if we do it's gonna be up to her to fix it.

If there are, how do they feel about this?\n\nIs there a possibility your Future BIL doesn\u2019t like you?

I hope your parents do not force you into going after all of this!", "NTA\n\nYour sister made it clear she didn't want you there and only changed her mind when threatened. You shouldn't go and I hope she feels like shit. In what world do child free weddings mean I dont invite my 17 year old sister I was really close with? She's a child too it seems", "NTA. I understand child-free weddings, but I truly do not understand why she wouldn't invite her sister if you really were that close. She's having the best day of her life and is actively telling you you can't be part of it, and can only begrudgingly come because she won't get money if you couldn't. That's selfish and greedy.\n\nIs there any reason to consider her fiancee talked her into not making an exception for you?", "NTA. Strict 18 cutoffs for a wedding get ridiculous at certain points, and this is a strong illustration--you were close sisters and she knew you were just as \"adult\" as you'd be in three months; this isn't some question of a cousin whose 17 and she just didn't know how mature they'd be.", "NTA\n\nMy sister had a no kids wedding when I was like 15/16 and she made the the maid of honor. Siblings are an exception to the rule in my book", "NTA. If you haven\u2019t already, do make it clear to your parents that you know full well that you are only reluctantly invited because she didn\u2019t want to lose their money, she still doesn\u2019t want you there. The hurt is not absolved just because she was forced to thrown you an invite. Don\u2019t go, and tell any family members who ask the truth about why. \n\nAlso, what a horrible thing to do to your own sibling. If you guys were close before this, this must have really hurt very deeply.

You\u2019re 17. You\u2019re not exactly a child, it\u2019s not like she has to worry about you running around and getting food on the walls or anything or interrupting the first dance, and then she only invited you due to financial repercussions. I think your response is very mature and valid. I don\u2019t go places I\u2019ve been made unwelcome too", "NTA. Her wedding and she doesn\u2019t invite you because you are a couple months shy of 18. Pretty much shows how little she values your relationship. I\u2019m really sorry. Must be painful.", "NTA, what a horrible thing to do to an immediate family member.", "NTA. That\u2019s really shit, to say your 17 year old sister can\u2019t come to your wedding, yeah if I was you I wouldn\u2019t feel like going either, your parents are wrong to be trying to sweep it under the carpet.", "NTA you\u2019re reaction is pretty normal in my opinion. She don\u2019t invite you due to a stupid rule (who put a 17 years old in the same basket as kids?) and then invited you because of money.\n\nThere\u2019s no respect coming from her and it\u2019s up to you to decide how you feel about it.", "NTA.  OP you handled it well.  Being the petty person I am if in the future the sister needed a babysitter to say if OP isn't good enough to attend the wedding she isn't good enough for babysitting.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds like she's gone full bridezilla to not even invite her own sister that is just under 18.  Luckily she doesn't live with you, so it shouldn't be hard to go LC or NC.", "NTA she dosent want you there, so no reason to go. Your sister will forever be the one who didn\u2019t want you at her wedding.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s heartbreaking. I couldn\u2019t imagine not having my 17 year old sister at my wedding. She\u2019d be the first person I\u2019d invite! Hell she\u2019d be my maid of honor. I don\u2019t know how she could possibly make it up to you. That\u2019s so hurtful", "I wouldn\u2019t want to go either if I knew that I wasn\u2019t actually invited and would be there only because my sister wanted the money from our dad. Even if she considers 17 \u201ca kid\u201d, she should have made an exception for you, no one would have questioned it otherwise. She knew exactly what she was doing. NTA.", "NTA. She made her bed and now she has to lie in it.

Absolutely ridiculous she thought her 17 year old sibling should be included in the no children rule, and she clearly does not value your relationship as her sister", "I recently got married and had a no kids rule at the wedding. My wife and I wouldn\u2019t of considered you a kid. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d be seriously pissed. Your whole family is going to to be there (just no kids) and because you\u2019re just three months shy of it she didn\u2019t invite you? That\u2019s cruel.", "NTA. I would skip it and tell her you attended her next one. I read somewhere that like 60% of people who get married between ages 20-25 end up getting divorced. Odds are, she\u2019ll end up divorced in a few years anyway.", "NTA. \u201cNo kids\u201d should not include 17 year olds lmao. Especially not someone who is almost 18. The vast majority of child free weddings do not exclude older teens.  Especially when the older teen is a sibling.\n\nShe made her idiotic bed, now she has to lay in it. I can\u2019t believe she wouldn\u2019t invite you just because you\u2019re 17. She\u2019s insane if she thinks that\u2019s a standard \u201cchild free wedding\u201d thing to do. You\u2019re her sister for crying out loud. \n\nFeels like a flimsy excuse to not invite you. Is there anything else going on?", "NTA-This is the correct response, people need to be responsible for their actions. Who wants someone who cares do little for you in their life?!", "NTA. She was being absolutely ridiculous and if she doesn't see why you're upset and not acting buddy-buddy, then she's really dense.", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t get past the fact that you will be closer to 18 than not since she told you that you missed the cutoff by 3 months. I wouldn\u2019t go if it was me.", "Nta she doesn't want you there so why would you go????", "NTA, your sister is showing you her true colors and I bet on reflection you\u2019d be able to see that your relationship before this was fairly one sided", "NTA - never go where you are unwanted, and you\u2019re absolutely not wrong for being hurt.\n\n\u201cSister did not want me there. This is her day, and I am respecting her wishes. She\u2019s made it clear, even in the invite she was forced to give. I want her to have the day she wants, and that does not include me. That is not being dramatic, it is what she said. I, however, don\u2019t have to allow her the access to me to hurt my feelings. Because no matter what I know my sister do not want me at this big life event.\u201d\n\nI am truly so sorry. Wedding planning brings out the worst in others.\n\nYour sister made a choice, so you also have the option to do what best for you. You have nothing to be sorry about.", "Nta. Who doesn\u2019t have ALL the immediate family on top of the guest list ffs?", "NTA.  \n\nIt's her wedding.  If she doesn't want you there that says a lot.  She's not entitled to any sort of relationship with you after making it clear you mean that little to her.", "NTA and I am so so sorry you experienced this. It\u2019s so hurtful and I think you have amazing boundaries for someone so young.", "Another AITA with people ready to nurn briges with family just for a \"child free\" party. NTA", "NTA. She didn't want you there (for whatever ridicolous reasoning) and you're just complying with her wishes.", "NTA\n\nIt was her choice to exclude you, and she's hiding behind an arbitrary rule that she made up in the first place. \n\nShe needs to sincerely apologize before any kind of communication from you.", "NTA. That\u2019s terrible. The whole \u2018No kids\u2019 thing is always kind of controversial and hurtful even when it\u2019s little cousins and whatnot. But to apply it to a 17 year old sibling? I would be hurt too.", "NTA. i understand wanting a child-free wedding, but that usually doesn\u2019t include your 3 months away from being 18 years old little sister who you\u2019re supposed to be so close to. and if she invited you while still complaining about not wanting you there, i definitely wouldn\u2019t change my mind about not going.", "Even if I m having a child-free wedding, I would make exceptions for family.

Do not let her or anyone guilt you.\n\nGo plan something fun for the day and enjoy yourself.\n\nShe will realize too little too late that she ruined the relationship not you.", "NTA. I have never heard of siblings being too young to go to a wedding. My brother was friggin 10 when I got married and it never occurred to me for a minute he wasn\u2019t coming. Yeah he was the only kid there but he was my brother.", "NTA! I don't know what it is with some of these brides, but the ridiculousness is just overwhelming. I have a sister like that. 6 years older than me, and she still sees LIFE as a competition. She HAD to get married and have kids, but not just a couple! Oh no, she needed to have the MOST kids out of the rest of my siblings (she only \"tied\" with my other sister, with 4 kids), because that made her \"special\" or somehow got her \"points\" for...life, or something? She then had this uppity attitude about being \"a woman now\" because she's married (a.k.a. she had sex. Big whoop. \ud83d\ude44), and *I* was still a *child!* \n\nYeah... she has 4 kids and is currently separated from her husband on the way to divorce. \n\nMeanwhile she's MAD that I had the *audacity* to get married after turning 30, adopt a child, or get pregnant & have a baby (she never thought I would do ANY of those things, let alone ALL of them!). She has yet to acknowledge my husband or kids and hasn't spoken to us directly since the wedding, which was 6 years ago. Oh, and she's an Essential Oil MLM hun to boot! \ud83e\udd23 Yeah, no. I would NOT want her life!", "NTA OP\u2019s sister is shady. The parents are wearing blinders! How did they not know one of their own children would not be invited to the wedding of their other child in which they are contributing financially?

Your sister is being really petty.  I would be petty right back. I wouldn't go, why would you? She has made it obvious she didn't want you there.\n\nShe has the right to want a child-free wedding, but that doesn't prevent any repercussions. Also the fact that you are 3 months off is just strange. I personally wouldn't prevent a 17 or even a 16 year old from attending a child-free wedding.

It is not always meant as some kind of insult to children.", "Yea, I think child free weddings are weird.", "As someone who loves kids, I do get it. Plan on having alcohol and letting your guests (or yourself) get wasted? It's reasonable to feel uncomfortable having littles around. Know that some of your friends' kids are going to be screaming/crawling under tables/monopolizing their parents' attention when you want to be able to have uninterrupted adult conversations? It's not like the kiddos are going to enjoy sitting around in a stuffy traditional setting anyway. But child-free weddings should always have childcare provided when financially possible, or else expect people not to attend. (Like with destination weddings where guests have to provide their own travel/hotel accommodations.) That's just good hosting.\n\nAnd not including a teenager just shy of adulthood is just rules lawyering. OP's FBIL doesn't want her there, and he's pulling every stunt he can to make sure she isn't.", "I do get it, I have seen my parents wedding video and no one could hear a thing over the crying babies. Have you ever been to church (any religion)? I grew up going to church and every 2 minutes a baby screams and then a parent had to duck out and it disrupts everything. Not exactly what you want while you\u2019re trying to say your vows. I do get it, but there is a proper and polite way to go about it.", "No. A wedding is for the bride and groom. Not to appease others. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that immediate family should still be included.", "It is quite literally for the bride and groom. If other people want a fancy party, they can pay for one.", "I was thinking the same thing, peculiar she's not even a part of the wedding", "I was wondering the same thing. I mean, how many weddings have you ever known where a sister of the bride **wasn\u2019t** a bridesmaid? Especially a younger sister.", "All I can think is, it must be exhausting to live like that.", "If she hasn't apologized to you directly, she doesn't feel bad. Keep her blocked and don't invite her to your wedding.", "She probably expects you to forgive her sometime soon. But that is up to you, just know that you are right to feel a little betrayed.", "If she truly felt bad she would have apologized directly to you. She doesn't feel bad, she just wants your parents money. \n\n\nHave a wonderful day doing something YOU love for the day of her wedding. So that even if she apologizes you have a prior commitment and cannot attend.", "But they are giving the sister the money, despite her making a big show of not wanting OP there.", "I do understand but it's sounds like \"I don't want to go, as much as I want her to want me to go. It's a perfectly understandable position but if you wanted to go to the wedding here is your opportunity. Don't cut off your nose to spite your face.", "Niiiice\ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\udc4d.. \n\nBet that felt like a good 'gotcha' moment \ud83d\ude06\n\nHope the holiday / wedding went well \ud83d\ude01", "Right. It usually means guests can't bring kids. But siblings, children of the couple and maybe some other relatives, if you're really close to them (not the ones you only see once a year during the holidays.)\n\nThis seems really bizarre.", "Sounds about right.", "You\u2019re crazy. Not inviting a sibling to a wedding is bat shit crazy unless the siblings are estranged.", "Anything can mean anything. I can say \"Pet Friendly\" and mean \"no humans under the age of 50\". Fact is the bride excluded her own 17 yo. sister from attending the wedding. That's her right, but it doesn't make her not an asshole.", "Not the person you're replying to, but I think they mean the childfree umbrella usually means 16+ or even 13+.", "The former. I\u2019ll edit my post to clarify.", "Child free USUALLY doesn\u2019t include teenagers after a certain age. Is that 13,14,15? Up for debate. Never been to or heard of a child free wedding that excludes 16 & 17 year olds, let alone the sister of the bride.", "They're saying what the common use of \"child free wedding\" means.  \n\nIf you want to get pedantic about it, everyone is someone's child even if they're an adult.  So are you saying everyone magically popped into existence?  Or are you going to recognize that words have multiple meanings?", "But there\u2019s a difference between minors who are third-cousins or neighbors\u2019 kids, and your own damn sister. I get wanting a child free wedding, and not wanting under-21s because of an open bar. But to not invite your own sister because she\u2019s three months shy of her 18th birthday? There\u2019s something more going on here.", "OP sounds American (possibly Canadian) Legal drinking age is 21.  And it\u2019s 19 in Canada, except Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta. I think OP would have mentioned alcohol if that were a factor.", "Then the event should be labeled as 21+ (or whatever the legal drinking age is for your country\u201d, not child free", "She\u2019s the sister of the bride not some random guest. \ud83d\ude44", "I have two wedding both had kids due to sane parents, the kids didnt even bother any one.  But I guess  two 3 year old singing happy Birthday  when  we where leaving the  church could be too much for some.    It was special day and then you sing the special day song.", "Not sure about the \"Safety reasons\" but I always roll my eyes at the alcohol part, like 99% of weddings I have been to have alcohol AND kids, and not a damn thing bad happens.  That always just feels like an \"I hate kids, but gonna use this as an excuse\".", "That a lame excuse. In most states in the US it is illegal to serve alcohol to anyone younger than 21. Do you suggest 21+ weddings?", "Me to. I\u2019ve been to probably fifteen/twenty weddings over the years and never been to a child free wedding and in that time only ever been to one that was a free bar for the whole day/night and that still had bar staff who would check the ID\u2019s of the younger members of the wedding.", "I love having children at wedding receptions for family. They're on the floor dancing with their aunts and uncles. I love getting to see the next generation. And then they're usually off to bed by 9.\n\nMy cousin decided to have a no-kid wedding and a lot of family didn't attend because they lived out of town and had children. She was hurt by the lack of attendance and it just wasn't as fun as the other cousin's weddings.", "Maybe, maybe not. We don't really know how this story will end. Even if they DO give the sister the money, absolutely no one in that family will forget what a huge, asshole trollop she was. Hopefully, the sister/trollop considers it worth the money contributed VS relationships and family respect lost\nMoney cant buy everything, but it does certainly buy truth in these circumstances.", "It sounds more like she's hurt her sister didn't invite her because she's three months away from eighteen and then the sister made it very obvious she still wasn't welcome when actually inviting her. This sounds more like being hurt than spiteful", "She was going to have to tell her parents why she wasn\u2019t going since everyone seems to have assumed she was invited.\n\nIt would have been a lot more drama if morning of mom asked her why she wasn\u2019t dressed and op had to say she wasn\u2019t invited.", ">I do understand but it's sounds like \"I don't want to go, as much as I want her to want me to go\n\nExactly! That's the point. When you attend someone's wedding, you go to support whomever l loved one you have is getting married. So for her sister to throw a big stink about not wanting OP there says a lot about how she views their relationship. Why would you want to attend someone's wedding if you know the bride and groom don't want you there?", "So is it OK to not invite a 12 years old sister of the bride?", "You would think\n\nBut OP also failed to mention the lack of relationship with future BIL in the OG post\n\nI'm just speculating based on personal experiences on this one", "There are sometimes age restrictions to avoid being sued. As for hating kids, I think you are reading too much into it. Beside there are actually badly behaved children in the world. And sometimes parents actually enjoy an evening without their children.  There are other parties that children don't go to and I just think in the end it is their choice about who to invite. Some people think weddings are formal events not meant for children.", "My comment was about what the other commenter was saying not my own personal opinions.\n\nSince you want to bring in my thoughts on child free weddings: anyone close to the couple is usually an exception.", "I have a cousin who is getting married. 18 and up. That includes his own teen sisters. It's an asshole move because they are very hurt. But his fiance doesn't like his family so.. she wins I guess.", "Usually the close family are exempt from the rule.  \n\nIt's so guests don't bring small children."]}
