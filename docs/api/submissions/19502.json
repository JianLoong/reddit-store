She doesn\u2019t hate the religion or anything she just didn\u2019t think it was for her. We met about a year and a half ago and have been together for a year. When we met she was still questioning and then about five months ago she decided it was official, she was agnostic. She didn\u2019t tell her parents all this time cause she wanted to be 100% sure. \n\nAt the beginning of this week, we were out and saw her mum. She came up to us and started talking and asked who I was since we hadn\u2019t met before. My girlfriend started stuttering and I took matters into my own hands and told her mum that I was her boyfriend and that she was no longer part of the religion she was in. Both my girlfriend and her mum were caught off guard. My girlfriend asked why did I say that. I told her that it\u2019s been a while since she decided she wasn't Muslim anymore and we\u2019ve been together for so long and since she wasn\u2019t worried about her relationship with her parents after telling them she didn\u2019t have to wait anymore.\n\nMy girlfriend and her mum walked away and chatted and her mum was shocked and said it\u2019ll take time but that it\u2019s okay and she\u2019s just happy my girlfriend is happy. So I thought things turned out great. \n\nLater on, my girlfriend messaged me to say I was out of line and it wasn\u2019t the time or place for me to say something that wasn\u2019t my place to say. She was going to tell her parents privately when she was ready. I told her things turned out fine. She said I was an arse and it was untrustworthy. Later her siblings and friends who all already knew too messaged me to say the same thing that I was a coward who couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. \n\nSo even though things turned out fine AITA?", "created_utc": 1686428610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146a3tm/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_mother_shes_no/", "score": 145, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Controlling boyfriends. Immature boyfriends. Boyfriends who need to manage their girlfriend\u2019s relationships with their family and finally\u2026 abusive boyfriends. Now you might not be those things, but this is what people who do that do.
