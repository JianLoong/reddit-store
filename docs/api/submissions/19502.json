She doesn\u2019t hate the religion or anything she just didn\u2019t think it was for her. We met about a year and a half ago and have been together for a year. When we met she was still questioning and then about five months ago she decided it was official, she was agnostic. She didn\u2019t tell her parents all this time cause she wanted to be 100% sure. \n\nAt the beginning of this week, we were out and saw her mum. She came up to us and started talking and asked who I was since we hadn\u2019t met before. My girlfriend started stuttering and I took matters into my own hands and told her mum that I was her boyfriend and that she was no longer part of the religion she was in. Both my girlfriend and her mum were caught off guard. My girlfriend asked why did I say that. I told her that it\u2019s been a while since she decided she wasn't Muslim anymore and we\u2019ve been together for so long and since she wasn\u2019t worried about her relationship with her parents after telling them she didn\u2019t have to wait anymore.\n\nMy girlfriend and her mum walked away and chatted and her mum was shocked and said it\u2019ll take time but that it\u2019s okay and she\u2019s just happy my girlfriend is happy. So I thought things turned out great. \n\nLater on, my girlfriend messaged me to say I was out of line and it wasn\u2019t the time or place for me to say something that wasn\u2019t my place to say. She was going to tell her parents privately when she was ready. I told her things turned out fine. She said I was an arse and it was untrustworthy. Later her siblings and friends who all already knew too messaged me to say the same thing that I was a coward who couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut. \n\nSo even though things turned out fine AITA?", "created_utc": 1686428610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146a3tm/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_mother_shes_no/", "score": 531, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Controlling boyfriends. Immature boyfriends. Boyfriends who need to manage their girlfriend\u2019s relationships with their family and finally\u2026 abusive boyfriends.

Like he has *zero* concept of how that knowledge could harm his gf.", "I love that analogy \ud83d\ude02", "ugh exactly. heck her immediate family could be all fine, but other relatives may not be. \n\nI attended a course where the majority were Muslim males my age. They weren't active followers when on school grounds, and made it known that they didn't want their parents (mum in one's case at least) to find out. These were young men in Australia for crying out loud. For OP to be so deliberately disrespectful is mind blowing.", "I mean, I can understand that, it is objectively a trash religion, but you just do *not* go around telling sensitive information like that to people you just met. Especially considering that some members of that religion still take apostasy very very seriously.", "And who are you to decide when and how to \"get it all out there\" on your girlfriend's behalf? It was her decision to make and conversation to have, you had no right to even say anything about to her parents let alone out of the blue.", "A) It wasn't *yours* to \"get all out there.\"\n\nB) The first time you meet someone's family *isn't* the time to blurt out that they've left their religion even if your gf was okay with you sharing *her* business. \n\nC) YTA & there's something wrong with you if you can't understand that you not only disrespected her, but also betrayed her trust by telling her mom a very private thing that was ONLY HERS to tell when *she's* ready. \n\nWhat did you want to gain from this? Nobody says what you did (within the first two sentences, I might add) unless they have an ulterior motive or they're unaware that it's not what you're supposed to do.", "It was not your business, you have no boundaries or respect. It was not your place or your news to tell. How can you be this dense??", "Why the hell did you think it was your place?\n\nThis was *her* mother.\n\n*She* decides how to introduce people to her. And more importantly, *she* decides when to have the discussion about her feelings on the religion and culture she was raised in and her family still participates in.\n\nNone of it was any of your business and you had no right to speak on her behalf in this matter.\n\nHypothetical here: If instead your girlfriend had come out to you as gay or bi, would you have outed her to her mother?", "dumbarse better", "I'm autistic and OP is absolutely out of his mind. Not getting social norms doesn't mean we're stupid.", "Wtf is wrong with you?", "You'll have to provide evidence for that, because your whole post contradicts that...", "Yes are you if you thought this was your information to share let alone at that time \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8", "I had a stroke trying to read that.", "\"she won't break up with me\". Lol, she's not property, she has sovereignty over herself and she can do wherever the hell she wants.

Weird flex but okay.", "I am so embarrassed that you're a kiwi. And so ignorant of... *gestures vaguely* everything.\nMy 13 year old is seriously atheist and not shy in saying so.

Poor soul.", "Gotta be.", "Yeah. I refer to myself as an ex-JW, but technically I\u2019m just \u201cinactive\u201d so that my children still speak to me", "I actually think this is worse - the girl just announced something that was likely obvious but unsaid - this guy announced something that was completely off-topic. The only reason I can think he even brought it up was he was anticipating being asked if he was muslim or being frown at for not being muslim, so wanted to pre-justify that by announcing their daughter wasn't following the religion anymore (so his religious status was then irrelevant) but the conversation wasn't even close to there yet and his declaration was rude and unnecessary.", "It might be worse, actually. That guy didn't risk losing his family over that joke. This woman does. It takes a lot of tact to tell Muslim parents that you don't believe as they do. In the best scenario, they'll end up crying and imagining you in hell. In the worst, they'll want to send you there. Also, presenting your non-Muslim boyfriend to them is not something done lightly. My family has come to love my partner but he has done his best to present his most mature and controlled self to them. This guy... I'd dump him for this.", "I think this is way worse. Everyone expects a couple to bang, announcing it like that maybe not the best idea but ultimately everyone knows.\n\nThis however they would not have known and could have very serious implications for their relationship. Plus I am sure it's a shock regardless and they would have preferred to work through those emotions in private and comfort not in public.", "That person posted an update though- the girl confessed that her bf (OP\u2019s son) encouraged that line even though she wasn\u2019t comfortable starting off that way.

It wasn't a poor joke. He got the best care reaction but worst case she gets disowned. He \"outted\" her.", "It\u2019s worse. Depending on culture, he could have put his gf in serious danger.", "Yeah but that turned out to be the boyfriends idea.", "If I were her I'd be tempted, upon meeting his parents, to say, \"Oh, hi! Lovely to meet you! So, just out of curiosity, why did neither of you teach him to wash his ass? That really shouldn't have been my job.\"", "exactly. autism shouldn't be the go to here. the OP knows what he did was wrong.", "Seen it happen to 2 of my autistic friends who talk like this when they get a new girlfriend. One is quite functioning outside of social norms so has a nice car and the only 2 women to date him rinsed him of everything he had.\n\nThe other is lovely and the same happens to him apart from after a breakup he ends up smashing everything and having mental breakdowns for months on end and friends and family have to pitch in to get him back to 'normal'\n\nIt's the real world and people with severe autism are struggling. No all in the same areas obviously. I don't think classing the whole thing under autism is helpful too when 2 cases can be so different from each other.", "This isn\u2019t upvoted enough", "Yoooo same, died a little inside knowing he's kiwi too. OP is a moron", "Well said I was thinking the same thing and what a massive YTA and then also doubling down in his comments", "Same. He's massively letting the side down", "Me too. Come on dude - exercise some basic common sense", "YTA. \n\nIsolation is one of the key tenants of abuse.\n\nFrom what else he's said and his overall attitude, it makes a lot of sense that he was hoping she would be disowned and only have him.", "Are girls allowed to have boyfriends if they\u2019re practicing Muslims?", "There was an update?!?

Seriously?", "Yep I was thinking either he\u2019s plain stupid or a calculating narc who is trying to get her family to disown her so all she has is him. I have a feeling her family is smart enough to keep a healthy relationship for when she inevitably leaves his disrespectful ass.\n\nA partner is supposed to protect you, protect the things you\u2019ve shared with them in confidence. A good partner should make you feel safe and your life should be better to have them in it.  They SHOULD NOT be throwing you under the bus and causing problems and drama in other areas of your life. \n\nEither he is using his whiteness as an excuse to be clueless as to the repercussions this can have for her or he is genuinely a bag egg.
