Literally yesterday I was climbing and a dude walked directly under me. If I were to fall, it super likely that one of us is breaking something. \n\nObviously don\u2019t be a dick about it and don\u2019t insult any beginners. If you\u2019re going to do or say anything, provide useful constructive feedback in a positive way to help them not be a danger to others. Don\u2019t insult them behind their back.

Obviously, the advantage of electrifying the sport is to remove the ambiguity of \"did you hit your opponent\" with nice easy buttons on the end of the blades, and lights and sounds that indicate a hit occurred. However, for beginners, we just have people 'acknowledge' when they got hit, and it's a big part of the honor of the sport to acknowledge your touches when you get hit while fencing dry. This goes even to accepting when someone is adamant that they hit you even if you didn't feel a thing (which under 3 layers of heaving clothing isn't unlikely). Inevitably, there will be some d-bag who thinks they don't have to acknowledge their touches and thinks their 'playing the game' by claiming 'it was too light' (there is a minimum amount of force you have to hit with in 2 of the 3 weapons). This is, of course, exceedingly short-sighted and stupid because you're telling your opponent that they didn't hit you with their piece of steel **hard enough**. And people who lose touches to d-bags who won't acknowledge their touches are usually more than happy to oblige.\n\nMoral of the story: don't be a d-bag if you don't want bruises.", "This, OP.
