Is it because a woman came in and climbed what all the guys had been struggling with? It doesn't sound like he was going off about all those guys \"failing.\"\n\nMaybe the guy is sexist, maybe he isn't. All I'm saying is I'd be alert and watch for any similar behavior.", "Gotta love all the males insisting no aspect of this was possibly sexist.", "Totally agree. I'm also a long time climber. I used  compete in bouldering. I was really competitive with my friends and we always celebrated each others sends even when we were competing.

I'd have done the same thing you did.\n\nMy buddies and I complain lightheartedly to each other about all the \"rentalshoes\" in the gym this month making it busier than normal because of everyone's new years resolutions, but we also happily give advice, shout encouragement, and offer fist bumps (high fives hurt when your hands are tired) to the \"gumbies\" while they're working on a difficult V0 or V1. I have been climbing for 10 years and I keep a screenshot on my phone to show new climbers how I was so proud to reach the top of a V2 that I took a selfie and posted it on Facebook back in 2015.

Getting picked first in sports, getting the job, getting the contract, getting the girl, beating your friends at a game... like... a LOT of life is built around being better than other people. These are all things that permeate our day, and if you look at any of them, we don't have control over most of the outcomes. We are at the mercy of life, others, capitalism... whatever.  \n\nYour boyfriend doesn't have a competitive problem. He has is a competitive nature and a control problem.. a positive/negative. He doesn't feel in control of the situation, so he takes it out on others/this girl/you. He cant control your reactions, so he leaves you behind. That's something he can control. \n\nHe wants someone to 'back him up' so he feels like he has support.  To a lesser extent, he wants to signal to others 'his way' or 'his qualifications' are the 'right way/rule'. \n\nThe climbing girl she has been competing with her self since she was your skill level. She's gotten to a level where she is confident in herself and she doesn't need a strangers approval. She has a competitive nature, without a control problem.  Its a positive/positive. She competes with herself... who she was yesterday. Your boyfriend competes with who is around him today.\n\nThe path out for him is to become comfortable with himself, accept he cant control everything around him, and inner focus.  There's a path out, and its not a hard path to follow. He just has to put in the work.", "Tell him my child could climb a V6 at 11 years old....", "I used to climb a lot. Your boyfriend will be extremely threatened by you if you ever get as good as him.", "It is possible that he changed his criticism just for being outshined though.  Guys do this towards other guys and its just a way to detract from someone else's win because you are overly competitive.\n\nIts like someone in MMA winning a fight where they were the underdog and, after the fight, they moon or flip off their defeated opponent.  People will criticize him for bad sportsmanship, etc., even though he still has the win.

If I had my feelings hurt each time this happened, I would probably quit. \n\nA few days ago me and my cousin were struggling on V4-V5 routes, and in front of us we saw a ~10 year old girl doing a V10.", "BF imo, is beyond AH.

Not definitely sexism, but sexism is more often than not a silent contributor rather than overt Adam Tate.

From there, you get up to the top however you like, and finish on the final hold in a controlled manner.
