Throwaway cause I know \"Ellie\" is on Reddit.\n\nMy (33m) fiance \"Jessie\" (31f) has a friend named \"Ellie\" (30f).  Jessie and Ellie were childhood best friends but stopped talking for awhile after high school.  They found each other again on Facebook a couple years ago and have been talking and hanging out a lot lately.  \n\nOne thing the three of us have been doing is going out to eat once a week.  Jessie wants me to get to know Ellie, wants Ellie to be her MOH, and we've been getting together to plan the wedding.  Well, this has been going on for awhile and every time we go out I've noticed that there's usually a guy or two checking Ellie out.  Both Jessie and Ellie notice this and they giggle about it.  Jessie always tries to get Ellie to leave her number but she never does.  \n\nThis is because Ellie's a romantic asexual (by choice, Jessie's words.  I guess something happened when she was younger?).  She's really sweet, cute in a girl next door kind of way, and smart.  She likes men and wants to date but she knows she has issues with that subject so she just stays single.  Well, we went out to eat on Friday and the waiter there was nice looking.  Ellie was clearly smitten and Jessie joked if Ellie didn't give him her number, that Jessie would do it for her.  Ellie said she would.\n\nSo I might be the asshole for this.  I said that Ellie shouldn't lead the poor guy on.  Jessie was confused by that and I said it wouldn't be fair for the guy to start talking to Ellie and like her just for her to pull the rug out from under him.  I'm a guy and I know other guys.  He was good looking and would probably prefer a normal girl.  I said it would be a better idea for her to either stay single or get on a dating app where she can be 100% upfront from the beginning about it.  \n\nEllie just quietly said \"okay\" and didn't leave her number.  Jessie called me an AH when we got home and went to stay with Ellie.  She's been frosty with me all weekend.

Maybe her past trauma is from someone raping her, or being taken advantage of... To be fair though I don't know the entirety of asexuality, so forgive me if I'm being a dummy / inconsiderate.

Because if she really was mistreated in the past and just hasn\u2019t slept with anyone since you\u2019ve known her, she could be demisexual or waiting for a committed relationship or marriage.\n\nAdditionally, if she wants a relationship without sex (or if she wants anything at all that could be a possible dealbreaker - like only dating within a particular religion, or not having children), she can mention it before the first date, on the first date, or possibly even the second date and still have it be considered upfront.", "It's honestly gross how you're intervening as if this person being asexual and potentially going on dates is some kind of morally wrong thing you need to protect other guys from. It's not your civic duty. You admit you don't know the whole situation, if it's rude to ask more details, it's rude to presume you know the situation.\n\nAlso, adding in the \"I do want her to be happy-\", like, bro, no you don't. Don't piss on someone's leg and tell them it's raining. You seem to care more than anything about whether or not this man you don't know goes on a single date, finds out he isn't getting laid, and then they potentially decide not to continue.\n\nThe bottom line is to just keep your mouth shut. This is childish.", "Ace people do all the romantic partner things but end in cuddling and watching movies on the sofa instead of sex, hell sometimes they even have sex as a gesture of romance with their partner, there's a difference between wanting sex to get off with your partner and wanting sex as a gesture of romance, for example an ace individual might set up a whole romantic day with their partner and have it end with sex but they won't seek casual sex from their partner such as just being horny in the morning and wanting to do it to alleviate the horniness", "Either way, you shouldn\u2019t have said a goddamn word.

In the case of people who fall inside the spectrum of what is considered ace, but aren\u2019t simply purely ace, there might be circumstances in which this sexual attraction might happen, as it happens with demi people and those they develop bonds with.\n\nSome ace people like the physical feeling and intimacy of sex regardless of the fact they don\u2019t feel that attraction, these are the sex-positive aces; some ace people are repulsed by the idea of having sex, and some people are somewhere in between.\n\nYou can be ace and have sexual trauma that prevents you from having a positive or neutral relationship with the concept of sex (so, in general, not talking about ace sex repulsion here), or be ace and have issues that creates compulsive sexual behaviour, but neither affects your sexual orientation per se, just your behaviour.\n\nIn the same way, having trauma that prevents you from having sex doesn\u2019t make you ace, just makes you traumatised like anyone can be about anything they have bad associations with and then avoid as a result.

My first thought when I read OP's post was did he expect Ellie to have sex with the guy on the first, second or third date?  What's wrong with having a male companion to go out on dates with no expectation of sex afterwards?  I don't understand how this would be leading someone on unless OP (since he said he's a guy and knows other guys) thinks that a woman expected to have sex with him/them after a date?!", "It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re not into sex, but could be into romance.
