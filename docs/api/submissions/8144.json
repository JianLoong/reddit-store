Throwaway cause I know \"Ellie\" is on Reddit.\n\nMy (33m) fiance \"Jessie\" (31f) has a friend named \"Ellie\" (30f).  Jessie and Ellie were childhood best friends but stopped talking for awhile after high school.  They found each other again on Facebook a couple years ago and have been talking and hanging out a lot lately.  \n\nOne thing the three of us have been doing is going out to eat once a week.  Jessie wants me to get to know Ellie, wants Ellie to be her MOH, and we've been getting together to plan the wedding.  Well, this has been going on for awhile and every time we go out I've noticed that there's usually a guy or two checking Ellie out.  Both Jessie and Ellie notice this and they giggle about it.  Jessie always tries to get Ellie to leave her number but she never does.  \n\nThis is because Ellie's a romantic asexual (by choice, Jessie's words.  I guess something happened when she was younger?).  She's really sweet, cute in a girl next door kind of way, and smart.  She likes men and wants to date but she knows she has issues with that subject so she just stays single.  Well, we went out to eat on Friday and the waiter there was nice looking.  Ellie was clearly smitten and Jessie joked if Ellie didn't give him her number, that Jessie would do it for her.  Ellie said she would.\n\nSo I might be the asshole for this.  I said that Ellie shouldn't lead the poor guy on.  Jessie was confused by that and I said it wouldn't be fair for the guy to start talking to Ellie and like her just for her to pull the rug out from under him.  I'm a guy and I know other guys.  He was good looking and would probably prefer a normal girl.  I said it would be a better idea for her to either stay single or get on a dating app where she can be 100% upfront from the beginning about it.  \n\nEllie just quietly said \"okay\" and didn't leave her number.  Jessie called me an AH when we got home and went to stay with Ellie.  She's been frosty with me all weekend.

Maybe her past trauma is from someone raping her, or being taken advantage of... To be fair though I don't know the entirety of asexuality, so forgive me if I'm being a dummy / inconsiderate.

Protecting her from that by preventing her from getting to know someone is not helping her.\n\nWhile it is possible to be extremely upfront by putting something like this in a bio, it may also inadvertently attract people who think they can \u201cchange her mind.\u201d", "I don't have her number and when I asked for it Jessie told me no.  I'll have to wait until I see her.", "And the first time she tries to get out of her comfort zone and try to find some healing, there's this asshole kicking her head back under the water. After all, people who are not normal should just stop trying, right?\n\nMind your own fucking business.", "You know this and you are still so judgemental and unempathetic?", "Poor Ellie :(", "> She's only ever had one relationship last more than a few months because most guys she's met weren't interested in someone who is asexual.\n\nNo, no - that guy was like you who believed you put kindness tokens into a person & are owed sex as a result.", "Also how does he know that Ellie wouldn\u2019t have told the guy about being ace?", "Thank you!  This is so true.  Asexual is a very broad spectrum.  It doesn\u2019t mean they never have sex, per se.", "Jessie told me right before I met Ellie that she's asexual.  And after getting to know her a little bit Jessie told me Ellie's never had sex before.  I don't know what demisexual is but Ellie has talked about maybe having sex if she got married because she could trust him.", "Clearly OP thinks we throw cake at the person we\u2019re interested in or do some other weird stuff to grab their attention because we\u2019re \u201cnot normal\u201d. If I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve head stuff like this\u2026", "This is what makes it so heartbreaking. This poor woman. I really hope that she is never subjected to this AH again.", "Yeah, when I was younger (pre-teen / teenage years) when I should have been \"boy- crazy\" like my class mates / friends, I found sex repulsive. I couldn't ever think of doing it with someone but I still enjoyed cuddling / hugs / kisses. I thought that was just who I was and I'd have to find somebody that wasn't interested in sex either, but it was due to the emotional trauma that made me feel that way. Now, I'm completely fine with it and even thoroughly enjoy sex / having that intimacy with my fianc\u00e9. I only considered myself asexual because I didn't think I felt that way because of the abuse I suffered; I thought that's just how I was but going to therapists / psychiatrists and saying sex made me uncomfortable and made me think back on what had happened, it was clear that the reason I didn't entertain / enjoy the thought was because it put me back in the memories when I was sexually abused. If this is the case for her, I hope she gets help to try to heal that part of herself. OP certainly didn't help by saying she wasn't normal though and said in another comment it felt wrong to try to date a guy with so much baggage or some shit. Like everybody has a past, Jesus fuck man, show some compassion.", "This is correct. You can be asexual and still have sex, it's the lack of sexual desire that is key. But of course it is a spectrum and also thank you for pointing out some aces are sex-positive, some sex-repulsed, and some neutral.", ">My definition of normal is probably average. \n\nWords fail me.\n\nGreat comments from non-OP", "Demisexual is where someone usually only experiences sexual desire after forming an emotional bond. It differs from asexual, which is where someone usually doesn\u2019t experience sexual desire. It seems like asexual is a word that Jessie is using to describe her understanding of Ellie\u2019s experience and life, and it may or may not be a word Ellie herself uses, or an identity she personally ascribes to. Also, being a virgin is not the same thing as being asexual - you can experience sexual attraction but still choose to wait for whatever reason."]}
