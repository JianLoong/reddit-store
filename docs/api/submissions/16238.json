I had a tough childhood so I became friends with her and got close with her family. Sarah married Mark (Fake name) and at first I was a bit iffy because they were polar opposites but honestly they were in a way, I thought, the others better half.\n\nI met my now husband, D, in high school, but we reconnected and he 100% changed my life around for the better\u2026 When I first introduced Sarah to D she seemed to like him along with her husband. But then shit hit the fan.\n\nSarah and Mark have dealt with fertility issues for a while, i\u2019ve felt really bad for her and tried to be her shoulder to cry on and give support. But then I got pregnant with my twins. Me and D didn\u2019t really want a baby shower or gender reveal so we just told friends and family when they visited or we visited them. When I told Sarah she looked absolutely heart broken, mark suggested that we left and we did so. From that on me and Sarah were only really texting each other, not visiting or really talking about my pregnancy.\n\nBut, I decided to visit Sarah since she wasn\u2019t feeling too good and Mark was busy. It was hot out so I was wearing a crop top, something i wear pretty often and hell, i\u2019m fucking pregnant with twins, that shits gonna show.\n\nWhen I arrived everything seemed okay but then sarah began to go on a speech about how she felt about D. Claiming he was brainwashing me into being the perfect house wife and how he\u2019s gonna leave me when I have the twins(Which isn\u2019t like D at ALL) and I of course got upset because I don\u2019t want you talking about my husband like that. So I tried to calmly defend him and she blew up, screaming at me about how I abandoned our friendship over him. I ended up crying and leaving, trying to drive myself home (which I know I shouldn\u2019t have tried to do) and calling D who tried to console me all the way home, offering to pick me up if I pulled over.\n\nMark even reached out, I thought that he\u2019d be the middle ground as he often was during our fight but he texted to scold me about how unfair I was being to sarah.\n\nHonestly, this is all hurting me. Sarah was there when my parents weren\u2019t there to console me or they hurt me. I did so much with her. Should I have just not visited while pregnant? D keeps trying to reassure me but I feel more angry than anything. I hate how she talked about the man who has made my life nothing but joy. Hate it. But shit I don\u2019t know. I genuinely don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\nEXTRA INFO: Sarah texted me about not feeling well and I offered to swing by and bring her some canned soup I had. She agreed and when I got there she seemed more quiet but never outright aggressive like she was later. More of like someone who is trying to plan what they\u2019re gonna say or like observing? Sarah is very bubbly and loud like I am so having her so calm only made me think that she was actually sick, not that she was still upset.", "created_utc": 1683048081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135uai6/aita_for_showing_up_to_my_infertile_friends_house/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only thing I can think of is that she is used to you being very dependent on her and her family. So when you started your relationship with D, you no longer needed her as much, thereby shifting the power dynamic.\n\nGive her time to adjust and see where she was mistaken. She'll either get herself together and be a supportive friend or she won't. Nothing you can do about her, and you're about to be very busy with the #1 and #2 priorities in your life. (And your husband is #3). \n\nIf she can't handle not being the most important person in your life, that's a her problem, not a you problem. \n\nTake care of your own family first.", "NTA you can't go into hiding just because you are pregnant and she isn't. You also had prearranged the visit.\n\nAs someone who went through fertility issues and never thought I'd have a child I would have been upset had my friends disappeared because they were too afraid to show me their pregnancies. \n\nIt sounds like your friend is going through a lot and has taken it out on you. Sounds like she might need some counselling but you haven't done anything wrong.", "NTA. Sarah sounds like she needs therapy. I can't believe how some people need to be shielded from something like a pregnancy just because they can't get pregnant. Should you not drive a car to your friend's house because they can't afford a car? Not talk about your job because your friend is unemployed? It seems ridiculous. \n\nWhat has happened before that she would say all this about your husband?\n\nI'd just drop her if I were you. You don't need some berating you like that while you're pregnant.", "NTA, but why do you assume this has to do with pregnancy/infertility? \n\nLots of friends have \"breakups\" related to a new partner coming into the mix. Sounds like she just doesn't like your husband and how your relationship with her has changed. It happens.", "NTA\n\nIf she agreed to you stopping over to check on her and knew you were pregnant I'm not really sure what she expected?\n\nShe's allowed to be upset she's having trouble but she should be happy for you as your friend IMO.", "NTA, though it sounds like Sarah needs therapy. I'd distance myself in your shoes because she sounds jealous not just of your pregnancy but of the fact that you aren't 'hers' anymore. She seems to resent your husband for taking you away and the pregnancy is a very physical reminder of that.", "OP you're NTA- Sarah is jealous of you and your family. Seems to me she's projecting her relationship with Mark onto you and D. She can't be happy for you and your pregnancy so she is trying to tear you down. I understand she's been there for you in the past and that's great, but right now she is not being a good friend to you", "NTA. I must be lucky; the 57 variations on a theme of very personal assholery here are enough to create a new sauce.", "NTA. She is obviously aware that you're pregnant and with twins it's going to be even more so obvious. It's not your fault, or even theirs, that they are having fertility issues. She is allowed to be upset about it, but taking it out on you and projecting all her issues is unfair. She needs to work on things herself and get herself help.", "NTA. You can't process Sarah's emotions around infertility for her. It is not your responsibility to cease existing just because you being pregnant bring up bad feelings for her.\n\nSarah is an adult who can choose not to scream at you. Her and Mark are both in the wrong.", "NTA - I get how difficult it is to see pregnant people and babies when trying unsuccessfully to conceive as I struggled for a really long time, but to take it out on a friend who\u2019s enjoying a wonderful moment in her life is wrong. Unless she has specific examples of things D does to brainwash or abuse you, she\u2019s probably making it up, which is just shitty. Maybe she feels more comfortable being the benevolent friend to a person going through a tough time and can\u2019t handle a reversal? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably best to give her some space and hope things work out for her.\n\nBest of luck with your pregnancy! I have twin girls and love it, but twin pregnancy is no joke. D had better be doing every single thing he can do you can sit down the moment you get home from work.", "NTA- keep your distance from this Sarah, I get that she is emotional but that is no excuse for trying to make your friend feel like crap. Sarah and Mark ATA I suggest finding a new friend. One that doesn't try to break you and your husband up and can be happy for you and your twins.", "This post again? Or am I supposed to believe another woman in a crop top, pregnant with twins, stopped by her infertile friends house and got into a fight about it", "Covetousness has turned into envy.\n\nIn my opinion, a responsible parent would never take their children around her until she manages to have some of her own. \n\nNTA", "NTA she's clearly broken about you having children and that not being a reality for her. All you can do is offer your friendship and reassure her that she has very much misjudged your relationship with your husband and that if she continues, you may need to call things a day on your friendship. Good luck x", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nInfertility is awful. It can make a person bitter, depressed, and, in Sarah's situation, envious. She is looking for a reason to be upset with you because she KNOWS her true feelings are that of jealousy, and by blaming you for abandoning the friendship, she is absolving herself of responsibility. \n\nBecause you two are close and have a significant history, I hope she is able to get the help she needs. It would suck to lose her over this, but if she can't acknowledge that her feelings are leading to sabotage, you're better off without her.\n\nCongrats on the twins!", "NAH. I think you're both going through a lot and things are exploding. Doesn't give anyone the right to make the other cry, but give each other time, I think your friendship will mend itself in time.", "Let me start with the first thing - you told your friends you were pregnant AND THEY ASKED YOU TO LEAVE.\n\nWhat a thing to do to someone who is trying to share something with you, EVEN if you are hurting from your own personal struggles. I have personally been there on both sides and it can be uncomfortable, but ultimately you want to support your friends and you can grieve with your partner in the quiet of your home once they\u2019ve left. \n\nThis situation where she is trying to erode your trust in your relationship at a time when YOU are vulnerable and need extra support\u2026.it\u2019s just uncalled for. She may be sick, but she is not pregnant with TWINS! That puts an immense amount of strain on your body, plus hormonal fluctuations, other challenges of pregnancy like your body changing, etc. \n\nYou obviously really feel for your friend but I think at this time, surround yourself with people that build you up. You already have to give so much of yourself to your babies\u2014there is no extra to be giving to grown women who just want to take from you. Save your energy. \n\nNTA and I wish you all the best with your birth!", "Y-T-A for surprising her with your advanced pregnancy instead of letting her know before the visit so she could process. Oh...wait... You did let her know ahead of time.\n\nY-T-A for screaming at her and insulting her husband. ...wait, that was her, wasn't it? You didn't do that at all.\n\nY-T-A for not detaching your pregnant belly and leaving it at home! \n\nOkay, seriously though, NTA OP. \n\nYou were considerate in how you shared your pregnancy news as you recognized that it's a painful topic for them. You showed grace in accepting that Sarah didn't want to discuss your pregnancy when you two texted. And you're pregnant with twins; it doesn't matter how you dressed, that belly is going to show. This is a huge part of your life right now and it results in some obvious physical changes, Sarah needs to accept this without attacking you.\n\nSarah is TA and in desperate need of therapy to help her cope. Mark is also TA for doubling down on Sarah's assholery instead of being a voice of reason.", "NTA. Some people face fertility issues and it's really *really* hard for them. But they have to learn to exist in a world where other people do get pregnant. Some of those people might even be their friends. As a friend, you celebrate your friends good news with them even though it kind of hurts. \n\nBut, to the \"So I tried to calmly defend him and she blew up, screaming at me about how I abandoned our friendship over him\" part of this story. If I'm reading this correctly, you tried to be there for Sarah still by visiting with your husband and your pregnant belly. But HER husband, Mark, asked you to leave. You didn't abadon her, you abided by HER HUSBAND'S wishes. \n\nI'm not sure how you're being unfair to Sarah. If you can't be there for her because she can't handle that you're pregnant, you have no choice but to leave her alone. You did a really nice thing by bringing soup to your friend when she wasn't feeling well. A thank you was the appropriate reaction.", "NTA and she is not your friend anymore. Time to call it quits and move on. She's jealous of your pregnancy and willing to attack you over it. She's unlikely to apologize or come to terms with you having children. Cut your losses.", "NTA time to tell her that you can no longer be friends because of the way she treated you", "NTA\n\nEven though i feel sorry for her, she knew when she texted you that you are pregnant.\n\nShe probably thought she's going to be able to ignore your pregnancy, but she's not.\n\nSo she blew up at you because she's unhappy.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, she wouldn't have been TA if she would have asked you to leave or told you all this.\n\nInstead she took out all of her frustrations and marital problems.\n\nIt would have been different if you went by her uninvited or she wouldn't have known about your pregnancy or if she wouldn't have blown at you. \n\nBut instead she is unhappy because you have what she wants. You're married with a loving caring husband, you are pregnant and your whole life seems perfect. Her husband is TA too because he scolded you. \n\nYou could send her a text telling her that you love her, you miss her and you are sorry she is upset. You will be there for her when she decides to talk to you. \n\nThe blow up, even though unfair to you, came from a broken heart. \n\nI think that in time she will be your best friend again. \n\nDon't cut her off yet, give her space and let her know you will be there when she's ready. \n\nAt least that's what i think. Take care of you! Hugs!", "NTA. I mean, why is it your problem. Am I an asshole for, lets say, walking in front of disabled people who can't walk? If no, then why are you in that situation?", "NTA- just give her some space.\n\nShe\u2019s coming from a place of hurt. Her attacking your husband (because it\u2019s his fault your pregnant) is just her trying To justify the envy she\u2019s feeling.\n\nNot much you can do , but give her space .", "NTA your so-called friend Sarah is not being a real friend if she\u2019s taking her insecurities out on you about not being able to have a kid then she shouldn\u2019t be in your lives. if this is how she\u2019s going to treat you throughout your pregnancy and even after you have your kid, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s worth keeping around because God only knows what  she might be capable of doing if you let her around your kid. I think OP you need to start putting yourself with your pregnancy and your unborn kid first and maybe go low contact with Sarah and her husband for a while and then get back in touch with them a few months after your pregnancy is over. if they\u2019re still show some hostility and resentment towards you because you\u2019re able to have a kid and she can\u2019t I\u2019d say cut your losses with her because I guarantee you won\u2019t be the only person she\u2019ll do this to with her behavior and how she treated you just now.", "NTA honestly it sounds like Sarah needs help and quite honestly it\u2019s help you can not give her.\n\nSo to protct your mental health and your health while pregnant it may be time to distance your self from her.\n\nSo this is where I may be spending to much time on this app and have become deeply jaded. But I truly believe in it\u2019s better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. \n\nYour friends behavior is suspicious. If I where you I would only limit talking throw text so you don\u2019t have to be physically there for her outburst.\n\nI would keep all text messages and voice mail. I would install cheap ring cameras at your door the ones that record. Listen your friend is struggling that doesn\u2019t mean she can say or do what she wants. The above things I mention to keep will become needed if her behavior becomes more aggressive. The above things will be needed for a restraint order if necessary.\n\nI would for my peace of mind call your dr and password protect yours and the babies medical files. I would also let your dr and the staff at the hospital your husband is the only one allowed to see you or the baby. No one else because you do not need to deal with her rage at the hospital. \n\nAnd honestly if she calls and even if she apologizes I would tell her that you are not wanting visitors for a few weeks to months after the babies are born. And if you do let her visit make sure she isn\u2019t left with them. \n\nInfertility changes everyone. It\u2019s a stress and trauma most of us will never understand. Some women learn to heal to an extent from the trauma others let the trauma destroy their mental health.\nI think your friend may be the one that it is destroying.\n\nBut quite honestly I don\u2019t think you will ever be able to have the friendship with her you once had. And for your sake you need to accept it. Do not let her steal this time away from you. It\u2019s ok for you to enjoy your pregnancy. It\u2019s ok to have a baby shower. You did nothing wrong. This is a happy time and you should celebrate it.", "NTA. she wanted you to come over and launching into you about your husband was weird, at best. but it was kinda tacky for you to go over there wearing a crop top.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that she\u2019s struggling but to suggest that you abandoned your friendship? Having kids can be a next step for many couples and it looks like she was wanting this for herself. Is this a situation where if she couldn\u2019t have kids, you shouldn\u2019t have for the sake of your friendship? If so, that\u2019s ridiculous.  You have a husband, she also does. \n\nI\u2019d keep in low contact with her. It unfortunately sounds like by virtue of you being pregnant, it\u2019s upsetting her but there\u2019s nothing you can do about that, nor should you change just to avoid upsetting her feelings.", "NTA,  but moving forward leave Sarah alone and focus on your pregnancy.  Sarah is obviously having a hard time dealing with your pregnancy.  Hence the reason her husband asked you to leave when you told them and probably why you two had only been texting every  since.  I get it you want her to be there  for you and to be happy  for you. She obviously mentally isn't in the head space to do it. So give her some distance. No it's not ok that she lash out at you but what is posting this on Reddit going to accomplish? Did you really think you were wrong in this situation?  Will it give you comfort to have strangers tell you Sarah is the A.H?", "INFO: Is she right that you stopped spending time with her when you and D got serious? Have you changed while married to him?\n\nShe didn't mention the pregnancy or children. Isn't it more likely that she's felt neglected and abandoned by someone she considered a very close friend? Mark was the one who asked you to leave back when you told her about the pregnancy, not her.

If she doesn't then she's not a real friend.", "i don't necessarily think you owe her an apology for it, but it was kind of obviously flaunting it in her face. bringing it up might just be uncomfortable for both of you. \n\nwhat did her husband say you were doing that was unfair to sarah when he texted you? did he mention your pregnancy? i remember when i was in a relationship and my best friend broke down after several months and told me she felt like she'd lost me to my boyfriend, and i had no idea. maybe there's something that's made her feel that way, even if it's just her perception or like one instance. it sounds like you really value the friendship and want to keep it, so maybe have an open talk about that when you can both be calm.", "No you are not in the wrong but moving forward I would leave her alone. I have no idea what it is like to struggle with infertility, but it is never ok to lash out at others because you are hurting.  Based on your post it sounds like she was trying to distance herself without actually saying the words we need space. Maybe she agreed to you dropping by but them seeing you pregnant in person realized she couldn't handle it.  It doesn't make her attacking your husband ok. I'm just saying now you know she is struggling and the best thing you can do for her and yourself is to give her distance.", "I think what the person in the above comment is trying to say. Is don\u2019t let your love for her but you and your family in harms way. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your issue to fix. It\u2019s hers. And as much as it may hurt you may have to distance yourself from her. She can\u2019t be your main priority your family has to be. \n\nDon\u2019t let your love for her harm your mental health or your family.", "Yeah, but that is a pretty big change, so maybe it's not all that strange that she's gotten the wrong impression. \n\nBut you also say that you haven't actually seen her since you told her that you were pregnant? Don't you think that from her point of view, you've abandoned her?", "I will say this from experience I forgot to mention in the last paragraph that I was friends with someone for 15 years and they were extremely toxic for me and I had to break it off because she wouldn't apologize for something that was very trivial for her but very very serious for me. She basically told me if you don't come on this vacation with me instead of going to your grandma's funeral then I am not going to like you anymore you're not my best friend... So yeah I know what I'm talking about. It's hard because you guys have been there for each other especially for so long but it is not worth it. Cut her off if she does not apologize. Again I'm really sorry that you might have to break off a friendship but there's a silver lining You're going to be having twins!!! With someone who loves you and supports you!!! Congratulations I am so happy for you You are going to be one of the best mamas!!! Hugs\ud83d\udc95", "Her husband told me that I wasn\u2019t a good friend and that I was being inconsiderate of how she was feeling about their fertility issues.", "I agree I don\u2019t think op owes her an apology. And for the ones saying what she was wearing was the cause is to me like saying that someone was asking for it because of what they are wearing.\n\nOp is the victim here. Sarah needs to get help to deal with her emotions. You don\u2019t get to play the victim when you verbally attack someone.", "it sounds like she didn't tell him anything of what she argued with you about, and made it all about your pregnancy. it was dumb of him to get involved, but he probably thought he was just being protective of her, blah blah.\n\ni don't think you owe her an apology, but she owes you one for being so rude when you just came to check on her and bring her soup, which she allowed, knowing she knew you were pregnant. but yeah, i'd just talk to her and not let it stress you out. the problem is clearly on her side.", "If you stayed away from her completely, you would probably still be labeled as a bad friend. It doesn't seem like you can win with them. It really doesn't matter if you are wearing a crop top or a potato sack. You're still pregnant, and it will show. It's probably just best to take care of you, your babies, and your husband. It might hurt for a while, but you probably should just get them completely out of your lives. Are you supposed to hide your babies when they are born? Are you allowed to take pictures of your babies and post them on social media without being harassed? \nI understand that she's in pain, and she wanted you to hurt worse. Hopefully, her and her husband will get therapy one day. That way, they can at least see that by harassing a pregnant woman, they are endangering babies, and it doesn't look good on somebody trying to have children. Please protect your family and congratulations to you and your husband."]}
