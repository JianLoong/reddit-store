Your husband and dad wanted to do this and you should support them. Is it that much effort?  \n\nI get that you were annoyed that you didn't know the plan and got blamed for being late. But you can say sorry and get moving. If communication on stuff like this is an issue, discuss it later.", "YTA\n\nYou have to have known that your husband wanted his partner there with him for an emotional moment.

That's, like, relationships 101.\n\nI could give a fig about the dead people. They need nothing. Your living partner, though, needed his partner.", "YTA - Maybe he assumed you\u2019d go, fine but that hardly makes him an AH. But you knew about this plan and said nothing until the 11th hour. It also doesn\u2019t matter if you were close to them or not, your husband wants you there to support him and you\u2019re being extremely immature and rude about it.", "Yta, how hard is it to say 'no'?", "Yes, probably YTA for not being honest from the get go.  You disappointed your husband and your father because you just didn't feel like going.  Sometimes we make small sacrifices for the people we love.  Apparently, not you though.", "YTA - why not go just to support your husband? It clearly means a lot to him. If somebody that you cared about died wouldn\u2019t you like him to be by your side once in a while? \n\nYou call him out for not communicating with you but when asked if you were going so said \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d just say no if you had no intention to go.", ">He kept mentioning since day one that we'll visit graveyard on our last day of trip.\n\n>It really annoyed me a lot that he assumed everything on his own without communicating with me\n\nHE DID COMMUNICATE IT WITH YOU! YOU JUST NEVER RESPONDED/ OPENED UP A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. YTA.", "YTA. I\u2019m not big on visiting graves either, but sometimes you suck up a little minor inconvenience to support people you love. What you did was pretty cold to your husband.", "How did he not communicate with you? He said from day one that he wanted to do this. You can do this as a support for him. What don't you get about this?", "YTA, you knew damn well he had been planning this and waited till the very last minute to refuse. Also, I have gone to the grave sights of people I never met just because they were important to someone who is important to me. And I feel like most people would do that. Not everything is about you and your relationships. Be there to support your family ffs.", "YTA why couldn\u2019t you just go and thank your husband for trying to be supportive of this instead of throwing it back in his face. Nobody\u2019s asking you to cry over them or say some huge emotional speech, they just want you to visit and lay some flowers", "YTA. I mean. You should have at the least just said no outright. But even aside from that, would it have been that hard to support your husband and dad? Like. Were they secretly assholes to you or something?", "Uh...what? It really annoyed you that he didn't communicate with you, when you walked around sulking and stuing in silence for the whole trip, not once saying I don't want to go. But rather saying \"we'll see\"??? \n\nAnd then you blow up at your husband when he asks you to get ready?? Yeah, you definitely are the asshole in this. No matter what your reason for not going is. You handled this piss poorly.  \n\nYTA", "YTA, girl just go even if you didn\u2019t like them that much or weren\u2019t close, your dad and your husband were, at least be there to emotionally support them. like it\u2019s a couple of hours is it really that hard? you weren\u2019t close with them but it doesn\u2019t sound like they were horrible to you or anything why are you so against it\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d also mad at him for assuming you\u2019d accompany your father and partner to visit YOUR grandparents grave is crazy. be serious.", "Unless they were abusive to you or you have another reason to actually hate them, YTA for refusing to do this for your husband. Seriously. Don't you care about him?", "Yta your husband communicated with you repeatedly, you just didn't agree with what he was saying and chose to ignore it. You need to work on your listening skills and your empathy.", "YTA for your lack of communication.  \n\nYou were well within your rights to opt out of visiting the cemetery.  However, you were very aware of the plans your husband was making and that your attendance was important to him.  Why do sit until your already running late to tell him you didn\u2019t not want to go?", "YTA! Listen, once you are married, or in a committed relationship, you do things that you might not want to do.  You do it because you love and care for your partner and someday you will want your partner to do the same for you.  I bet if you asked your husband he has already done things that he didn\u2019t want to because you wanted to. He mentioned this trip to the graveyard over and over and you apparently never communicated to him that you had no intention of going.  It was extremely immature of you to not just support your husband and father rather than making a big deal out of this and probably ruining the last day of the trip.", "YTA and a selfish person. Why are you even married to your husband if you can't even support him when he asks you to accompany him to the graveyard to visit the graves of people he cares about.", "Yta. Hopefully your husband supports you when a close relative of yours passes, even if you didn\u2019t try to support him during his tough time.", "YTA. I understand why your first instinct was to think of yourself (visiting grandparents grave that you never were really close with isn\u2019t something that one eagerly wants to do usually) but I think you just lost that you\u2019re also someone\u2019s PARTNER. & he was clearly eager to visit the graves of people he was close to and love. & also you didn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d when he first mentioned visiting the graves, so it\u2019s not like you were even being communicative anyway so you honestly have no reason to be frustrated with your bfs or dad\u2019s response.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t listen to the \u201cYTA\u2019s\u201d If they wanted to see you so badly they\u2019d visit you.", "YTA: Tell me again how it hurts you to go to the cemetery is support of your father & husband?", "YTA it is not all about you.", "YTA, but only because you didn't share your feelings and thoughts before the morning of the outing. If you didn't want to go, you should have made that clear from the start. He mentioned wanting to go, and then he planned the trip to the cemetery. You were aware of all of this and said nothing until it was time to go.", "He clearly told you.\n\nYou skirted around the topic. Why was it so hard for you to clearly tell him no? You wasted his efforts and time getting flowers for you, and you built up false expectations.\n\nWhy weren't clear and direct? He cared about these people. you didn't, but we assume you care about your husband's feelings.\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nIf you didn\u2019t want to go you should have said so the first time he brought it up not string him along like you intended to with the \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d. Also even if you don\u2019t feel a connection to your grandparents I don\u2019t think it really would have hurt you any to go a support both your husband and your dad.", "Yep YTA. He did communicate with you. Repeatedly.  You kept saying we'll see. Just bc you didn't have a bond with these ppl, doesn't mean he didn't. You absolutely should have supported them. \n\nMy bf asked me to go with him to visit his dad's grave. I had never met his dad, I absolutely hate graveyards and his dad died in a way that triggers me for my own mother's death. But do you know what I did? Sucked it up and went to support him. Bc it wasn't abt me.", "YTA, he clearly wanted your company as it was obviously emotional for him. Christ.", "I seriously don\u2019t understand how people can type up stuff like this and not realize without posting they are the asshole. Apparently supporting your husband and dad comes in lower than a little bit more sleep.", "YTA\n\n\u201cHe kept mentioning since day one that we\u2019ll visit graveyard on our last day of the trip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI clearly remember never agreeing in words whenever he mentioned the visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really annoyed me a lot that he assumed everything on his own without communicating with me\u2026\u201d\n\nNo, just no. \n\nHe communicated very clearly\u2026 you were the one who did not. \n\nEvery day he\u2019s said something about going and you never once communicated that you did not want to, and you had multiple chances to do so\u2026\n\nThen you get mad at him for what you didn\u2019t do?!\n\nThat makes you an AH, a passive aggressive & manipulative AH.", "NTA, visiting a grave is a individual experience not to be judged by literally anybody.  Some people visit all the time, some people don't go at all for their own reasons.  People judging you for not wanting to go, can worry about themselves.  Personally visiting a grave does nothing for me, it doesn't evoke emotion...nothing.  I know that person isn't there, so I'm standing on their corpse.  I'd rather mourn and remember that person on my own, in my own way, away from prying eyes.", "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d rather sleep than support you through something emotionally difficult unless it\u2019s something that actively involves me.\u201d\n\nThat is basically what you just told your life partner, the person you\u2019re supposed to love above all others except your kids.\n\nYeah, YTA", "YTA Grow up and show some respect to your husband and father. \nThat\u2019s what adult people do, they accompany their significant others to the cemetery and hold their hand.", "YTA.  Your husband communicated his intentions to you.  However you danced around it.  You could have clearly stated your disconnect with your grandparents and amvivalence around going.  At which point he could have brought up going as a support to him and your dad.  But you avoided until the last second and stressed everybody out and created an unhappy emotionally charged moment.", "YTA and clearly showing your true colours.", "Yep YTA. You knew he was planning on going and the general expectation by any reasonable person would be that you\u2019d go, too, seeing as they too are your relatives. You could\u2019ve told him you didn\u2019t want to go whenever he brought it up, but you didn\u2019t say anything and that\u2019s being deceptive by omission.. it sounds like you didn\u2019t want to tell him you weren\u2019t going because you knew it\u2019d start problems. And it did, cos you left it till the morning of the visit to tell him.", "NTA. Visiting graves is for the living, not the dead. You are still among the living--and as such get to decide whether you visit the graves or not. Your husband and dad don't need you to be present for them to pay their graveside respects.  Stick to your guns.", "NTA. They\u2019re dead. They don\u2019t care if you visit or not.", "NTA. You told your husband plenty of times that you had no interest in going to see the grave sites, but he ignored you.\n\nCould you have communicated better? Yes, you should have been firm and vocal about not wanting to go from the start. Your ambiguity did not help. But that doesn't make you an AH.\n\nThese comments saying that you \"should have been there for your husband\" are really weird to see. This was his idea and his plan that you had told him you didn't want to be part of. Then he tried to force you to share his sentimentality. That is on him, not you.\n\nNo, you do not have to participate in events that mean nothing to you or that make you feel bad. But making it clear would be better than \"we'll see.\"", "NTA. \nIf it were only his grandparents, you would be the AH.

You don't have to visit your grandparents grave, but you could have emphasized that it's a \"maybe\".

You didn\u2019t go to their funerals and now you refuse to go to their graves? Wtf is wrong with you.", "YTA,\n\nIn my culture the funeral itself is quote literally jsut the burying of the body and instead of having a wake or service, friends and family gather at the deceased's hoem or the homes of their closest family members.\n\nI personally hate going \n round to the homes of the deceased to meet with family members, because everyone inevitably just spends their time talking about random things unrelated to the deceased or end up talking shot about other people. However, I always go to the funeral itself to show my respect and support family members.\n\nI've done this for many people who I barely knew but were close to my family members, for example, a few of my dad's first cousins that effectively were like brothers to him, or a distant relative that was like an aunt to him.\n\nYour husband was close to your grandparents and his, as well as the fact that it was your dad's own parents. Be there for them, even if you don't care about your own grandparents, which personally I find cold. My paternal grandmother died when I was 7 and paternal grandfather when my dad was still a child. I don't live near either of their graves, but when I am in the area, I will always visit because it is just respectful to show your respect.\n\nBe better", "NTA, I disagree with the y.  T. A. Folks. It is BS, IMO, to have this be all about them. Graveyards suck, dead people are dead, worship decaying or decayed corpses is not my thing. What if they had been cremated? Gotta go drive and visit the urn? Nah, visiting the dead is useless...\n\nRemembering the dead, that's OK.

And, rather than expressing your preference clearly, you went with \"We'll see.\" Just. Be. Honest.", "YTA and they", "YTA. Man OP, you may not feel it but it obviously means something to your husband. Going a little out of your way on his behalf isn\u2019t too much to ask. That\u2019s what marriage is.", "YTA.  They are right.  Would it have been such a huge ask to quickly get ready and accompany your husband and father.  It can't always be just about you.", "YTA especially for acting like your husband didn't communicate with you when it was discussed several times and YOU decided to be vague about going and never told him you didn't want to go.", "YTA.

They had, it sounds like, weeks to say they weren't going.  At any time before that day, when he brought it up, OP should have said they didn't want to go.

She wasn\u2019t close to the grandparents\u2026Could she have communicated this? Absolutely. But the emotional manipulation guilt trip being laid on her by her husband and now her father is outrageous. She should have said no she didn\u2019t want to go and was not going.

These people are ridiculous. Everyone deals with death differently and even if OP had a relationship, grieving is very personal and would be perfectly reasonable why she would choose to not go. There must have been a really good reason why the mother was allowed to move away permanently with her daughter and I'd be inclined to believe that reason is why she does not want to interact with her paternal side. I honestly think it's wrong for her husband to press a visit to the gravesite knowing that she didn't have a relationship with them.

Not sure why all these people think you have to\nperformatively mourn people you weren\u2019t close to. \n\nIt might be just me but are you a little resentful of the fact that your husband had the opportunity to know your grandparents while you didn\u2019t? I\u2019m not blaming you if that\u2019s the case I can kind of see why you might feel that way. If so, you both need to use your words. You need to tell him how you feel, and he needs to be a little more sensitive since he has no idea what it\u2019s like to have grown up in a broken home and is making assumptions as a result.

It was OP who didn\u2019t communicate how they felt, but even then man, you go and support your partner.", "Uncertain. My sample size is one.", "No?
