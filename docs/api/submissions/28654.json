As we were leaving, my aunt (who was visibly upset) pulled me aside, \u201cI need to talk to you, can you call me in a few days? \u201dI asked if she was ok, she said \u201cyes, I just need to ask you something, but not now.\u201d \n\nWhen I called to ask what was going on. My aunt said \u201cI heard something that seems very out of character for you and I want to see if it\u2019s true. Evidently, a few days before thanksgiving, my parents told her an untrue story about how my current husband and I met. To note, I was separated at the time from my now ex-husband when we met. \n\nShe explained, according to my parents: I met (H) while online soliciting for a proposed threesome with my ex-husband as a last-ditch effort to salvage my then failing marriage. However during this tryst, (H) and I supposedly realize we had a connection which lead us to be together while choosing to dissolve my previous marriage. (My parents shared more gross details, but I\u2019ll spare you).\n\nI was shocked as NONE of this was true. We met at work through mutual friends and our romantic relationship developed slowly over a period of time. I had repeatedly told my parents how we met, and even introuduced our mutual friends to my parents at our wedding as \u201cthe ones who got us together\u201d.\n\nSo, I FaceTime my parents and ask them why they\u2019re lying about us behind our backs? They look me dead in the eyes and say \u201cbecause that\u2019s what you told us.\u201d EXCUSE ME?! When I refuted this, my dad proceeds to get angry at ME saying that I must have amnesia as my mom stormed off refusing to discuss the issue. The rest of the call is me sitting in silence, while he attempted to gaslight me. I\u2019m dumbfounded.\n\nA few days later, I get a call from my cousin. She explains that my dad had told her husband the same story almost 8 YEARS AGO! Which they had believed until now. My cousin apologized for not saying anything sooner but the story made them so uncomfortable they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nH and I wrote my parents an email explaining what we had discovered and asked them some simple questions like: Why did you make this up? Who else have you told? etc. We\u2019ve been emailing back and forth for almost year and gotten nowhere. Their story keeps changing, the blame keeps shifting, and they have continuously tried to diminish the seriousness of this issue even saying \u201cno one thinks any less of you because of it\u201d. WHAT? It never happened. Period. The only apology we\u2019ve gotten is \u201cwe\u2019re sorry for upsetting you\u201d. You mean you\u2019re not sorry for lying about your daughter for 10 years?\n\nMost recently, they have almost demanded that we forgive them and \u201cmove on\u201d. Since we haven\u2019t forgiven them yet, we\u2019re \u201cresponsible\u201d for my mother crying all the time, and essentially breaking the family apart.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to continue to avoid my parents even though I'm tearing the family apart?", "created_utc": 1696966348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174tvs2/aita_for_avoiding_my_parents_after_discovering/", "score": 1528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But then my mom\u2019s mom was a complete whackadoodle as well and told the neighbors she didn\u2019t have children (since my mom was an adult) yet also her grandson (my brother) was an assassin. \n\nVery sorry you\u2019re going through this, but based on the comments from other posters, you\u2019re not alone.", "NTA, but could you PLEASE give some examples of what you mean by \"all the other weird stuff they've done to us?\" The only thing I can think of as far as motivation is they don't like or agree with something about your life? Or they don't like how little access they have to your life? So this is a weird, diabolically insane power play? Like, they're trying to humiliate you because you tried to draw boundaries with them or something? \n\nEither way, I am deeply concerned that you think you're the asshole here for avoiding people who, at best, don't care the collateral damage they cause you in making up stories to make themselves seem more interesting or, at worst, actively want you to suffer.", "Ohhhhhkay.  So this isn't totally out-of-character of them, it's just the most extreme instance of this kind of thing.  Honestly OP, I would notify the family members roped into the lies that your parents have a history of abnormal behavior, and then probably just cut them (your parents) off, or least withhold information about what goes on in your life from now on.", "Yeaaah dementia can take many forms and make anything that was already a bit off worse. Might be a good thing if you can find a way to mention it to their doctors", "Can you share some of the other weird stuff?  Did they just say other things, or did they do stuff?", "NTA.  Parents or not why would you want to be around people that lie about you and then say you're lying?  Your better off without them.", "I would seriously consider outing them publicly for their lies and shaming them into a corner. I know there are some on Reddit who hate it when this advice is given, but your parents have been damaging your reputation for almost a decade. This is especially effective on Facebook if your parents are the type. Anyone who gets upset at you, you can ask them where they were when your parents were spreading lies about you for the last 8 years.", "The only thing I can think of that makes a lick of sense (as much as you can make sense of this...) is if H is a different race from you guys and your ex-husband isn't?", "u/hereforthebagels100 , are they/were they on good terms with your ex? Is it possible he told them this story, and they believed it?", "\"Did you know mom and dad were swingers? They aren't even sure who my real dad is. I was conceived during a massive orgy\"", "Yeah this would be my first guess.", "That was totally my first thought!", "This is genius insight.  My ex-husband told my family I was cheating on him, hoping they\u2019d convince me to stop and stay married to him.  I was not.", "No, this is what I was wondering. It may not even be dementia-- OP should, if she hasn't already, ask her parents *how* they think she told them this. Was it, by chance, over text or WhatsApp or Facebook messenger? Because if so...I bet it was the ex.", "I know, right? It's bad that they are spreading lies, but it would also be wrong to spread the word if it was true.\n\nOP, your parents don't have a leg to stand on here. They have damaged your reputation and probably your relationships with family members. Mom is upset? How would she have felt if it had been you telling that filth about them?!?", "Very much so, not least because she's dead. She died when I was 45, having spent a grand total of 11 years in my life, on and off. It's honestly a relief that she's gone for good.\n\nBut anyhoo, point was, highly disordered people can and do become parents, unfortunately.", "That's a good way to phrase it!", "If that was the cause, wouldn't they be dead by now?  The lie started a decade ago.", "Agreed. Especially because personality disorders this severe aren't generally contagious. It's weird that both parents are as adamant this conversation happened.", "Why add fuel to an inferno? Just get out.", "Well\u2026 passing on salacious gossip is more attention seeking/narcissistic generally gross behavior.  Making it up is downright psychopathic.", "Saw that comment also, but he's really the only one with any potential motive to do this. Unless the parents are batshit crazy.", "To our face they agree with us, behind our backs it's obviously a different story.", "> When my dad was alive they fed off and supported each other\u2019s delusions so I knew anytime a sentence began with \u201cwell what your father and I think is \u2026\u201d that whatever followed would be bullshit.\n\nThat is sad but also very funny; apologies for laughing at your whackadoodle parents. \n\nThe equivalent in my family would be my multiply-acrimoniously-divorced parent's pronouncements on how relationships should be, which usually help me identify what I *don't* want to do in my own relationships.", "I want to hear the examples too. I'm betting they're on a spectrum, many of them sounding reasonable and even complimentary even though they're pointless lies.\n\nFor example, my mother convinced all her relatives that I lived in a very expensive waterfront condo, with a lot of oblique hints about both that I was making a lot more money than I was and \\*whisper\\* 'living with a man, oh no' to make it happen, and apparently this was something that had to be talked about constantly for a decade.\n\nIn reality I was living in a modest apartment by myself that was near a supermarket and on a bus line.\n\nI still don't know what their collective fantasy was for why, when it came up, I kept saying where I actually lived, because I cut off contact with all those people. I'm not interested in their dysfunctional games. I'm sure you'll recognize this experience -- if one of them made made a reference to something that was, \"Oh, over where you live,\" and I'd remind them that no, I live somewhere else, they'd act earnestly interested in this information, then minutes later they'd be back to talking about things, 'where you live' that were near their imaginary location for me and nowhere near where I lived. They very clearly had a shared narrative to account for why I could contradict them and name another place, but I don't know what it was. It's not worth trying to make sense of people who are determined to avoid making sense.\n\nNot my godmother though -- she never fell for the bullshit and had no interest in the collective game of pretending whatever lies one of them made had to be real, so she stopped hanging out with them too.", "Though it's real but it's sad!", "Satanic orgy. Go big or go home.", "BPDs and NPDs attract each other because of each of their dysfunctional needs and behaviors fitting like puzzle pieces (e.g. narcissist lovebombs to reel them in, borderline eats it up and stays because of their fear of abandonment etc.) so apparently is common for them to end up together.", "Sometimes I think I read this stuff bc it makes me feel so much better about my parents \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd23", "That's your proof they're doing it on purpose. If it was truly dementia or some other issue, it wouldn't be calculated like that. They'd act noticeably batshit insane to everyone.", "Yeah--just keep avoiding them then. Absolutely NTA. I agree with the \"bat-shit crazy\" diagnosis, lol.", "Lol exactly: \u201cThanks - now I know what to *avoid* if I\u2019m looking for a decent relationship!\u201d", "I think it makes almost everybody feel better about their parents! Sigh!", "My father said he wouldn\u2019t have married my mother if she wasn\u2019t a virgin.\n\nImportant note to self: Fuck everybody."]}
