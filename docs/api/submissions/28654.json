As we were leaving, my aunt (who was visibly upset) pulled me aside, \u201cI need to talk to you, can you call me in a few days? \u201dI asked if she was ok, she said \u201cyes, I just need to ask you something, but not now.\u201d \n\nWhen I called to ask what was going on. My aunt said \u201cI heard something that seems very out of character for you and I want to see if it\u2019s true. Evidently, a few days before thanksgiving, my parents told her an untrue story about how my current husband and I met. To note, I was separated at the time from my now ex-husband when we met. \n\nShe explained, according to my parents: I met (H) while online soliciting for a proposed threesome with my ex-husband as a last-ditch effort to salvage my then failing marriage. However during this tryst, (H) and I supposedly realize we had a connection which lead us to be together while choosing to dissolve my previous marriage. (My parents shared more gross details, but I\u2019ll spare you).\n\nI was shocked as NONE of this was true. We met at work through mutual friends and our romantic relationship developed slowly over a period of time. I had repeatedly told my parents how we met, and even introuduced our mutual friends to my parents at our wedding as \u201cthe ones who got us together\u201d.\n\nSo, I FaceTime my parents and ask them why they\u2019re lying about us behind our backs? They look me dead in the eyes and say \u201cbecause that\u2019s what you told us.\u201d EXCUSE ME?! When I refuted this, my dad proceeds to get angry at ME saying that I must have amnesia as my mom stormed off refusing to discuss the issue. The rest of the call is me sitting in silence, while he attempted to gaslight me. I\u2019m dumbfounded.\n\nA few days later, I get a call from my cousin. She explains that my dad had told her husband the same story almost 8 YEARS AGO! Which they had believed until now. My cousin apologized for not saying anything sooner but the story made them so uncomfortable they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nH and I wrote my parents an email explaining what we had discovered and asked them some simple questions like: Why did you make this up? Who else have you told? etc. We\u2019ve been emailing back and forth for almost year and gotten nowhere. Their story keeps changing, the blame keeps shifting, and they have continuously tried to diminish the seriousness of this issue even saying \u201cno one thinks any less of you because of it\u201d. WHAT? It never happened. Period. The only apology we\u2019ve gotten is \u201cwe\u2019re sorry for upsetting you\u201d. You mean you\u2019re not sorry for lying about your daughter for 10 years?\n\nMost recently, they have almost demanded that we forgive them and \u201cmove on\u201d. Since we haven\u2019t forgiven them yet, we\u2019re \u201cresponsible\u201d for my mother crying all the time, and essentially breaking the family apart.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to continue to avoid my parents even though I'm tearing the family apart?", "created_utc": 1696966348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174tvs2/aita_for_avoiding_my_parents_after_discovering/", "score": 4008, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They call themselves sisters to each other. They truly have a solid friendship. From school (I think HS but could be jr college), through drugs and severe addictions, jail and prison, loss (death)of partners, recovery, marriage(not each other), and becoming grandparents. I think my mom said their 50th friend-versary is in 2025? Mom wants to go on a trip with her, a cruise, but BFF had had some health issues lately that may make travel difficult for her. Time will tell though! I know they are each planning a big party for the other but the other isn't supposed to know. Lol kinda cute actually.", "Attachment theory is a hell of a drug."]}
