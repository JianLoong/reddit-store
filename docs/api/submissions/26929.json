It\u2019s been a day that I\u2019ve looked forward to my whole life and even more so now because my fianc\u00e9 and I have a 1 year old son and we will finally be and \u201cofficial\u201d family. My older sister (32) and I have never had the closet relationship but I try to put effort in to be involved her life and her 4 children\u2019s lives. When I was pregnant my sister offered to plan a babyshower for me but ended up canceling on me the week of. I was pretty hurt but never the less, I forgave her and moved on. Fast forward a year later, my fianc\u00e9 and I sent our our save the dates for our wedding 9 months in advance to ensure family  had enough time to take time off work and make travel plans. My sister expressed excitement about our wedding and even agreed to help do my hair the day of. A few days ago she told me she isn\u2019t coming to our wedding and didn\u2019t give me any reason. I was pretty hurt so I told her that it\u2019s her loss and she is choosing to not be involved in the important moments and that she will regret it some day. I told her that with her not following through on my babyshower and now not attending my wedding, the bridge is pretty much burned. Keep in mind, all my other siblings, aunts, uncles etc. are all coming. She is the only family member not making the effort. My dad says I was pretty harsh towards her, so AITA for telling her she will regret it and that it\u2019s her loss?\n\nEDIT: I should have mentioned that my sister has 4 children all under 10 years old. I am very understanding that she is busy with her kids, however, her kids were also invited to our wedding and I even planned a kids area at our reception for all the kids we have invited.\n\n2nd EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting that her husband maybe isolating her or not allowing her to attend. I do not believe that to be the case because she has attended many other (and very recent family events, like my sister\u2019s engagement) however, that is a genuine concern and I will make the effort to dig into that more and ask that another family member checkin to ensure that is not the case. If it is the case then yes I will accept that my reaction was wrong, but because she is always attending other family occasions I do not believe that to be the case.\n\n3rd EDIT: for those saying I haven\u2019t asked her for a reason, or tried to communicate with her, I did ask her for a reason, for both instances. She did my give me one. I offered to have a conversation, she declined and ghosted. Which is why I made the comment I did.

I understand.", "I don\u2019t want to dismiss this theory because abuse is serious so if there is any chance she is being abused I don\u2019t want to Dismiss it but I think it a far fetched theory. , i want to mention there are ZERO red flags with her spouse. She has been around many other family members and recently went on vacation to visit her friend and shared a space with her friend during that vacation(she traveled alone btw). So no I don\u2019t think she is hiding bruises.", "I swear this sub would rather assume a woman is abused and a puppet to her husband rather than confront the possibility that she may be an AH", "She originally accepted the invitation though. She also offered to plan my baby shower and offered to do my hair for my wedding. Again I didn\u2019t ask her to do either. She offered. Her sudden switch is what\u2019s hurtful. I agree maybe she prioritized her family, but I don\u2019t think it makes me selfish to be confused and hurt that she originally accepted the invite and offered to do things for both events, then cancelled (last minute mind you with no explanation.)", "That's SO cold, I'm sorry. Maybe have someone communicate with her that there will be childcare if that's what she was worried about.", "[deleted]", "I don't think you are being over the top. She literally canceled the shower she was hosting for you the week of.\n\nCanceling hair for a bride the week of is also terrible. Bridal hair is expensive and difficult to book.  My stylist in Phoenix did bridal hair for awhile. She made a fortune and was booked a year in advance. \n\nSo canceling the week of is super shitty.\n\nWhat does the rest of your family say? I don't buy that her husband is isolating her because she seems to have capacity for other family weddings and events.\n\nI am curious what your family and siblings think about this?", "[deleted]", "Absolutely it\u2019s hard to swallow. It\u2019s still impacts all of us and don\u2019t blame her. She did know my mom was attending the shower. And my mom has been at all family events including the recent one she attended. I agree she doesn\u2019t need to sit at the same table not was she going to be assigned to my moms table . I don\u2019t doubt this theory though. She very well could be avoiding my mom.", "I do not know what other issue she could have with me. I have asked and she has not communicated. Our wedding is simple. Not extravagant. We definitely do not make more than her and her husband. I work in non-profit work and my husband does not make a lot. We are on a tight budget for this wedding. I genuinely can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019ve done towards her to make her not want to attend. I\u2019ve tried asking. I can\u2019t improve myself if she doesn\u2019t tell me what I\u2019ve done or what her reasons are. The other events she has attended were not local to her. One was 4 hours away (we are 6 hours away from her). And the other recent one required a flight because it was 18 hours away. And all her kids went both times.", "It's a bit different when it's a family wedding, the kids are invited, and there is even a special play area for the kids. It's a real AH move by the sister of her reason is just \"the kids.\"", "I could definitely understand if it were a destination wedding over seas or something!", "I trust my dog not to eat the hot dog I drop on the floor more than trusting my youngest sister to do anything she promises, trust your expectations.", "Just a thought here...could she be hurt that she isn't part of the wedding party? When my sister got married, she didn't invite me to be a bridesmaid or maid of honor, which hurt me immensely. I was only 17, so my parents made me attend the wedding, but I skipped the ceremony. Now, years later, we are closer than ever, but back then, I was pretty hurt.", "Yeah, that sounds less like isolation with that info, although it could be a new development. It does seem less likely though. \n\nIt could be a less sinister form of isolation where there\u2019s ongoing marital disputes over something like their marital roles or finances and your sister feels like she needs to be the one staying with the kids more generally and your wedding is unfortunately caught in the crossfire.\n\nThere\u2019s clearly something up. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re dealing with this. Planning weddings are stressful enough when everything goes smoothly.", "If it isn\u2019t financial I\u2019d push the convo and ask if there is something that happened between you that you can work out - that you\u2019ve noticed she isn\u2019t really close with you and you feel she doesn\u2019t come thru for you on some things, etc etc.", "Gas is super expensive right now might not be able to afford that and doesn\u2019t want to say that. Lots of people have been getting laid off etc", "It\u2019s precisely because she already stood you up before that you have to be careful. Wanting your family at your wedding doesn\u2019t make you selfish but saying that she\u2019ll \u00ab\u00a0regret it\u00a0\u00bb is. \n\nLike I said, be happy with the people who actually want to be there for you. Best wishes.", "Ugh. I did tell her about the kids area and childcare. But did not get a response from her. Additionally, so many family members are coming she would have so many hands to help her!", "I have asked her if I did something and she did not say. I can\u2019t improve if she doesn\u2019t tell me what I did wrong. I told her it was hurtful that she last minute cancelled my babyshower with out an explanation but I didn\u2019t yell at her, I even expressed that I hope everything was okay and if she needed anything after she canceled. So no I didn\u2019t go scorched earth.", "My dad understands why I\u2019m upset but keeps defending her saying \u201cshe can\u2019t come because of her kids.\u201d I haven\u2019t spoken to my other siblings about it because I do not want to impact their relationships with her as well. My sister has always attended my other siblings events. My mom doesn\u2019t agree with her and thinks it\u2019s ridiculous she isn\u2019t attending.", "[deleted]", "Okay, that\u2019s your opinion and I appreciate the feedback. However, don\u2019t you find it odd that she is the only sibling to not be attending my wedding? She is the only family member to not be attending? If I was truly toxic like you think, surely my other family members would have also pushed me away.", "But if that was the case, she would not go to other events either. And it is not like you were mommy's little girl, you went NC with your mom for 2 years so she could at least share it with you... NTA at all.", "How well do you know her husband?", "I used to think the same way. Then as I actually started listening to my friends, I quickly learned that a look into someone's life doesn't give you the full story. Kids with behavioral problems, official diagnoses, finances, etc. While yes, using kids as an excuse is tacky, you don't know what's going on in a parents life.", "None of my siblings are in the wedding party but I invited them to all get ready with me.

I need to dig deeper. I have pushed the convo a little bit but maybe I need to push harder. I definitely want to know if I did something to upset her.", "I think that\u2019s a fair comment.", "[deleted]", "\u201cWhat about her kids is preventing her from attending? Her children are welcome, so it\u2019s not a childcare problem. Her children have attended other family events, so it\u2019s not a her-kids-can\u2019t-handle-crowds problem. Is it a financial barrier? Because we could discuss that, I\u2019m happy to help find solutions if the issue is financial.

Don\u2019t listen to this weirdo.", "[deleted]", "Decently well. Not like we talk everyday but they have been together a long time and so our family has gotten to know him really well. He is a really nice guy. No red flags with him", "Don\u2019t forget that, I myself am a parent, so I understand sometimes kids can make it difficult to attend thing, but my sisters kids do not have behavioral issues, or diagnoses, etc. sure it could be financial, but she should just tell me that.", "The sister just not liking the OP doesn\u2019t make sense in light of the sister\u2019s earlier excitement clearly something happened.\n\nMy point about \u201ca less sinister form of isolation\u201d is that sometimes families lockdown without abuse happening. If a couple is having fights about work-life balance, for instance, both parents might be committed to spending more time at home and having a better routine for the kids, which has the result of both adults being more isolated from their families without their being any abuse. I was trying to make the point that people can pull back from their other family members when stuff at home is off and it\u2019s not always about abuse.", "I\u2019m not? My point was that there are forms of isolation that aren\u2019t abusive. Couples going through a larger financial fight or other marital dispute might pull back from their larger family networks to fix things at home. That\u2019s a type of isolation, but it\u2019s not abusive. Those types of isolation or pulling back can be a mutual decision or the request of one partner.  There might not be any AHs here\u2014It might be a situation where the sister and her husband have a good reason to need to shift focus to their kids and just weren\u2019t ready to tell other people and it\u2019s just bad timing with the wedding.", "Am I not allowed to express that I am hurt by her lack of involvement in my important life events? Especially when I have sacrificed to ensure I\u2019ve been there for her important life events (example: I left a summer internship early to attend her wedding, and another time I took a 15 hour road trip to attend her son\u2019s baptism.) maybe saying she burned a bridge was too harsh, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say I shouldn\u2019t tell her how her actions have made me feel.", "Your solution is to act passive aggressively. That\u2019s literally how her sister is acting and clearly how you would act too. Your advice is really bad", "Yes I\u2019ve asked my dad for more details on that and told him that the kids were invited and welcome. He really didn\u2019t have an answer. He understands why I\u2019m hurt and does want my sister there but think the specific words I used were harsh .

But thank you for your feedback.", "Alright, just wondering if there were any hints or clues there. \n\nNo idea why I got downvoted for asking that.", "Well even after OP corrected the other person and dispelled the abusive isolating husband theory you tried to re-open it and suggest:\n\n>partner reinforce her identity as only a wife and mom so that she isn\u2019t independent.\n\n>She\u2019s not free to just leave. \n\n>your sister WOULD be free to have some independence, which would be a massive problem for a jealous husband who wants his wife limited in her identity to wife and mom.\n\nLook at the way you portray the AH sister as this puppet and the husband as the evil master when you don't even know them in real life. You saw that OP dispelled the abuse theory and still you insisted it was an \"evil controlling husband\" scenario. \n\nPeople who aren't gender biased don't infantilise women like this and don't demonise men like this.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s a valid question 100%!
