My older sister (32) and I have never had the closet relationship but I try to put effort in to be involved her life and her 4 children\u2019s lives.

Fast forward a year later, my fianc\u00e9 and I sent our our save the dates for our wedding 9 months in advance to ensure family  had enough time to take time off work and make travel plans. My sister expressed excitement about our wedding and even agreed to help do my hair the day of. A few days ago she told me she isn\u2019t coming to our wedding and didn\u2019t give me any reason. I was pretty hurt so I told her that it\u2019s her loss and she is choosing to not be involved in the important moments and that she will regret it some day. I told her that with her not following through on my babyshower and now not attending my wedding, the bridge is pretty much burned. Keep in mind, all my other siblings, aunts, uncles etc. are all coming. She is the only family member not making the effort. My dad says I was pretty harsh towards her, so AITA for telling her she will regret it and that it\u2019s her loss?\n\nEDIT: I should have mentioned that my sister has 4 children all under 10 years old. I am very understanding that she is busy with her kids, however, her kids were also invited to our wedding and I even planned a kids area at our reception for all the kids we have invited.", "created_utc": 1694804332, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jloqe/aita_for_telling_me_its_her_loss_and_she_will/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve put in a lot of effort and sacrifice into our relationship (one example is I left a summer internship early to make it to her own wedding). The relationship is very one sided and I guess it means that she needs to start making and effort. I will still invite her to the big family moments but I don\u2019t plan to go out of my way to make sacrifices for her, especially since she has not followed through on what she has agreed to do (my babyshower and helping with my hair on my wedding day).", "It means there is a lot to the story that OP is leaving out.", "YTA for being a coward and not telling your brothers fiance what he did...", "My comment about regretting missing it was more so about how she is the only family member not attending.

Your sister has made promises to you and broken them twice and refused to talk to you about it. Are you ever given the opportunity to see her by herself? Can she visit with any of your family on her own? \n\nIs her partner keeping her from being social with you? Is she isolated from the rest of your family as well? Is she financially controlled so that she's not allowed to spend money on the travel to your wedding or the outfits, etc? \n\nIs she social at all? Do her kids have playdates with other children or are they isolated as well?", "How far away is she? Would she have significant travel/hotel expenses for her and the kids?", "Does she miss out on other family events?  Does she ever visit family without her husband, either alone or with the kids?\n\nThe more I read your comments, the more I'm concerned that your sister is being isolated.  Is she cancelling or is her husband telling her to cancel?", "It is the full story. There is nothing else to add. I\u2019m being 100% honest. I have pressed her for reasons but she has not communicated any.", "For background, her and I have never been overly close but she has never given me a specific reason. Nothing drastic has happened (except for her canceling my baby shower the week of with no explanation)", "Something happened both times.", "Lots of people have kids but are still able to maintain relationships with their siblings.\n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't give you a reason for cancelling on your wedding is pretty strange. If it is the kids, you and she could come up with a solution. But to not offer any explanation?\n\nIt sounds like you care for her, and that's great, but you shouldn't be the only one making an effort to hold on to the relationship.", "There is more to the story, it is possible that you are not aware of it.  See if your dad knows more, your reaction was very poor by the way.  If her husband is isolating her and forcing her to cancel things, your response was 100% wrong.", "4 kids are hard to handle. She may just be worried about being able to wrangle them all night. I would say NAH.", "There is actually no more to the story. Except that I was extremely hurt by the babyshower and now her not attending my wedding. I have made a lot of sacrifices for her (one being that I left a summer internship early to attend her wedding). It means that she needs to put effort into the relationship.", "Gotcha.  But, if she\u2019s missing for something related to her kids, she\u2019s likely comfortable with that decision and won\u2019t regret not seeing people.", "She is not isolated from the rest of the family. She just attended my other sister\u2019s engagement party, with all 4 of her kids. Her kids are always playing with other neighborhood kids. She spends a lot of time with other family members as well.", "She is out of state from where the wedding is taking place, but we are renting a huge Airbnb (out of our pocket) for all my siblings their families and my parents to stay at. They are all road-tripping out together as well. It would not be as expensive. If it is because of her kids or cost of travel , I would hope she would communicate that. I\u2019d be a little more understanding of that situation. We sent the save the dates so early on to ensure travel plans could be accommodated. Also a note: my husband has family coming from a different country. Not sure if that relevant but we are very understanding of travel being expensive but they are still making the effort to come.", "She attends many other family events, with and without her husband. She just attended my other sister\u2019s engagement (her husband and kids were there) but she is very involved in other family events.

I truly hope that isn\u2019t the case, but if it is, then my reaction may have not been helpful in that situation", "She\u2019s being isolated by her partner.", "I give it a 1% chance that is true.  PS:  If hubby is making her cancel, your response was 100% wrong.  You need to figure out why she is canceling before you go scorched earth.", "For the sake of your sibling relationship, I hope the sister has a good reason or there's something more going on. In any event, have a great wedding and wonderful marriage!", "I agree, there maybe more that I don\u2019t know about. Someone else commented and suggested that I ask another family member to checkin on her, however, I\u2019m deeply sad my own sister won\u2019t be at my wedding. Maybe my reaction was not right and I will reflect on that. However, I have put a lot of time, and effort into our relationship. I would hope she would see that and want to share with me if she is struggling with something behind closed doors but she has not communicated.", "And I would be very understanding of that but she herself has never communicated that to me herself. That came second hand from my dad. If she just explained it would be too much to handle because of her kids I wouldn\u2019t be as hurt, but I feel I\u2019m owed the explanation to come from her,  not second hand. 4 kids is a lot to handle.", "You are absolutely right, And that\u2019s fine if she is missing it for her kids, but I never got that explanation from her. That came second hand from my dad. I\u2019m very understanding of when people can\u2019t attend events due to their kids, but she should be the one to communicate that, not continue to push me away or not have any sort of conversation about.", "I truly hope that isn\u2019t the case, but maybe I need to try to talk to her alone to dig more into that. Her husband was also invited to the wedding, but maybe there is something there that\u2019s happening behind closed doors we don\u2019t know about.", "I don\u2019t disagree that if her husband it making her cancel, then I would be in the wrong. I will try to have another family member try to dig and make sure that isn\u2019t the case. I will mention that she just attended my other sisters engagement Party, with all 4 of her kids and her husband.", "I am childless (40 y/o). I have many friends with kids that prefer to not share essentially that the kids are their reasons for not participating in things. It hurts for sure (as I love kids and always welcome them for fun times) but I understand that when people decline, their reasons are theirs. She may just not be comfortable sharing that with you.", "I thought that too", "I have a child and I definitely understand not committing to things because of my child, and I\u2019m very compassionate about that, however, she jsut attended my other sister\u2019s engagement party with all of her kids. There is a difference between life  Event like a wedding vs. not attending a smaller less important event like a game night because of children"]}
