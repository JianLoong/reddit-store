I don\u2019t wear pink, never really have.\n- I asked for a specific pair of inexpensive floral pattern rain boots from Payless. She got me a pair of plain gray rubber boots from Walmart.\n- I asked for a new vacuum, or money toward a new vacuum.

I use my best friends to buy my wife's gifts.", "\u201c I could have purchased the shirt myself, but at this point I became petty and let it stew over the years.\u201d\n\nSays otherwise", "It\u2019s the wrong shirt tho. She\u2019s been asking for the shirt for years now and he only got her the one with the wrong front cuz he was bragging to his sister and she rightfully called him out. How is she in the wrong if her husband can\u2019t be bothered to pay attention?", "Well, HIS WIFE CARES for one, so you would think that might matter to him.\n\nI'm sure if she only got him hot pink and neon green shirts from now on he would never ever complain....", "I cringed too. lol", "I like you. Let's sit together and be friends.", "Yes his wife cares, and it's an incredibly insignificant thing to care so much about. Hence my judgement."]}
