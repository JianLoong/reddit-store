The place they're going isn't far *out* of reason, but my husband won't eat there, I can't, and our son will most likely end up sick by the end of the night as well.", "I honestly noncommittally answer any time he asks why I don't go with them. My work schedule used to pretty specifically revolve around the fact they spend every weekend there. Now it doesn't and I'm working on publishing a novel as well as working out of the house a few days a week. Today they went for another birthday celebration for another family member, one who I will not speak to at all for the fact he falsely accused another man of r*pe to get out of being found drunk in a stranger's front yard. I'm not gonna go celebrate that. \ud83d\ude02", "I don't get the reasoning behind all these questions. Even  if the father and grandmother had good reasons to plan a trip to that place with the kid, they could have done it on another day than the actual birthday. Youy don't plan a birthday party for a child on the actual birthday that the child's mother can't attend.\n\nOP, don't let anyone distract you from the important facts: your husband set you up by planning a situation where you either break your NC and tag along with his mother's plans, or you won't be there for your child's birthday. This was intentional, cruel and disrespectful.", "We all have some pretty specific dietary restrictions and I'm immunocompromised, so we generally choose something that's open and outdoors with the option to bring your own food instead of cramped, germy, and indoors with no dietary options for us.\n\nEdited for crappy spelling.", "He goes to school, and his birthday falls on a weekday. It's literally splitting weekends at this point. They go to husbands mother's every single weekend though, so even if they'd have had a birthday party, I still wouldn't get to have one because my one day off a weekend they spend at his mother's. I don't work as many days throughout the week.", "I just like.... Really naively want him to make the effort. Because I know I'm worth the effort. I just don't necessarily know what it's going to take to snap his head back into place.\n\nWe've just recently gone through several losses and he's also depressed right now, which doesn't help. It's all a mess. I feel like giving up on him is the wrong thing, because at the end of the day I chose the relationship TWICE. I don't like to be the person that makes the same mistake twice.", "I don't actually know if I'm allowed? My husband basically made it clear he never intended to tell me, and doesn't think that it's f-d that that was his choice. I really don't know if I'd be welcome there by the other adults in this situation, and I'm not sure if that would make it a worse situation for my son.", "To answer your first question, our son had previously mentioned going to the place. I shut it down because it butts with a lot of restrictions in our household that are medical. He told grandma, who swooped in and made the plans and told my husband that's what she intended to do. My husband agreed, despite us having already talked about this previously, both of us agreeing we weren't going to that place, and replacing it with going to a zoo.\n\nTo answer the second question, my husband asked me if an outfit he had on was appropriate for a funeral, I told him yes. He had to call his mom to get a second opinion. This is FREQUENT. Any time I tell him anything, I'm immediately wrong until someone tells him the same thing.\n\nMy reaction to my son WAS because I was taken off guard, and he's a sarcastic noodle. He says random off the wall crap all the time, I thought he was mostly joking.", "It's a child friendly pizza place. We're lactose intolerant across the board. \ud83d\ude02 He's also allergic to red dye, I'm allergic to a lot of preservatives, it's going to be a vomit fest.\n\nOn top of that, yes. I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and along with that have a bunch of immuno and mobility issues.", "I definitely agree that I could have phrased it better, I was just very shocked because we'd previously said that WASN'T what we were doing, so I was kind of shocked.", "Yeah no, lactose intolerant, red dye, coconut are the main ones for food restriction allergies, I'm also personally very allergic to mushrooms.", "Lots of rules. \ud83d\ude02 I couldn't get into emotions or feelings or abu*ive crap or or the manipulation and lies and BS in the main post without getting it rejected. Was trying to work around as much as possible and using vague language as much as possible to get the points across.\n\nI appreciate the comment.", "You're okay, you don't have to change your answer unless you really want to. I just wanted to clarify. \ud83d\ude02 I'm willing to be the asshole, I just want opinions from people that don't know me.", "His birthday is in a few months, and *our* plan was mentioned several times in the last four months so far.\n\nI don't mean to be deliberately vague, I also struggle with autism, so I'm not good at context. But yes, it's been talked about this year, and several times over the course of the last few months. This plan has existed that I didn't know about behind the scenes while my husband was intent on making opposite plans. My son does not see any other birthday celebrations as being his birthday party, just this one.", "Correct. And most of the time, he stays the night there (even when he says to both of us he doesn't want to before he leaves. He's then asked by grandmother and can't say no because his dad doesn't want him to \"hurt feelings\" and grandma throws a fit if she thinks she's not the favorite at any given moment... as proven at my son's kindergarten program which she stormed out of because my son was sad he doesn't get to see husbands paternal grandmother as much) \n\nSo I work Saturday, they're gone all day. I don't work Sunday, they come home around 7. I only work outside the home a few days a week, so otherwise I spend a lot of time with my child, but when he's in school, as he will be on his birthday, that's a bit more complicated.", "My son talks shit frequently. He told me he was going to the moon Friday as well. I literally was shocked, a little irritated (because I thought he was just talking crap, since we'd already both told him we weren't taking him this specific place previously), and my husband wasn't responding when I asked him the question of what our son was talking about. Husband literally wasn't going to tell me anything about it, and admitted that.", "So... she planned it for somewhere he clearly wanted to go then.", "So the answer ofc is to make sure he stays. Whole weekend with grandma and grandpa if she's going to feed him things that make him sick.\n\nBut the real problem is not where they're going, it's the grandparent taking his birthday from.OP, and husband backing them up", "You make your son miss out on key child experiences because you can't participate. Let your son go with his dad's side and also throw a celebration at the zoo. His lactose intolerance explained as the health issues isn't a real reason.", "They go every single weekend?!?! Wtf. That would not be happening unless I was divorced /split custody. The entire post is mind-blowing.", "ESH. Your husband needs to communicate better. You also seem like you\u2019re making excuses because you don\u2019t like your MIL. Your son is old enough to get a say in how he spends his birthday and if his grandma wants to take him, I think you should make that happen. Plan something else with him, or suck it up and go.", "I get that you love him but at some point he needs to choose you and love you back for it to work. You really just need to tell him that.", "Him never intending to tell you this... You need counseling asap. Marriage counseling or individual. Along with your other comments, there might be some unhealthy level of codependency or something with your husband and his mom. Is this the relationship that you really want? Is this a relationship dynamic you're happy with? Not knowing if you're even allowed at your child's birthday? If your husband wants a separate life with his family and your child, in your place I'd give it to him. Share custody and go.", "I am sorry you are immuno-compromised, but it's not fair to your son to let that issue interfere with his chosen birthday plan. Let his go out without you if necessary and have cake at home later with presents. As for lacto problems, can he take something like lactaid for a day? Sorry, not exactly sure how that would work or if a child can take that. \n\nI'm not saying you should endanger yourself to let your son go out, but it's a pretty terrible situation if he is restricted from normal childhood interactions just to keep you from catching an illness. How do you manage contagions from his school and such? I know it's really hard for kids to isolate socially.", "Just out of curiosity, have you tried lactaid for you or your son?", "no i did change my mind.... sorry...maybe i was speed reading or maybe your tone seemed off... but my fiance has a similar situation,.. the family if her ex at times act like they are guardians and make plans without checking with mom, sometimes its innocent, sonetimes not. You cant have a bday and not invite the mom abd call it innocent.", "Thank you for clarifying. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA but shit out of luck. Unfortunately you got played this year by your husband and his mom, and you are right to be upset with them about that\u2026\u2026That being said, I think what\u2019s most important is what *your son* wants to do for his birthday, and if it means going to that place with grandma, you should let him. Maybe you can do something together with him for his bday on a different day? \n\nAnd in the future, maybe include your son on the planning from the get go now that he\u2019s old enough and you can all plan something together? The tradition was probably a nice idea when he was younger, but you can\u2019t really expect him to or everyone to always want to do it every year.", "Isn\u2019t your son like 6 years old??? He \u201ctalks shit\u201d?  Your husband\u2019s actions are not cool or productive but your son is just a kid caught in the middle of family drama.", "That he will get sick from. I cannot protect my son from craziness, but I can protect him from cheese, which gives him horrible diarrhea for days, and red dye, which makes him projectile vomit.\n\nMIL gives him full dairy and red dye constantly and sends him home to be sick because I'm just a \"crunchy granola person\". I literally restrict our diets because of allergies. This place isn't a food safe place for us.", "As soon as he starts getting sick, one of us gets called to come get him and handle it. Every time. \ud83d\ude02", "Yes. Every single weekend. \ud83d\ude02 Didn't even hit on the fact MIL expects to be visited no less than four times over the Christmas holiday. Two on Eve, Two on Day. (Nope, not kidding.)", "I'm not sure what the dosage is for lactaid or age, but that is an option if I can find it. \ud83d\ude2c We use lactose free everything in our home so it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI use a lot of hand sanitizer, he's got clothes to change into when he gets home, and if he's sick I try to limit contact as much as humanly possible for a caring mom that loves to cuddle... So I generally just get sick as well, but for a longer period of time and with worsened symptoms. It doesn't matter, because mom. So I still gotta do everything. I was nearly hospitalized a few weeks ago for a UTI I didn't realize I had from a kidney stone passing. \ud83d\ude43 My health comes last almost always.", "You're okay. I'm also autistic, so I find it hard to express emotions properly and I was just trying to go with facts. \ud83d\ude02", "The only reason he wasn't necessarily included on the plan this year is just because he's still not that great at understanding which foods he can and cannot eat with his specific dietary restrictions. A little bit of cheese could be fine, but it also could not be fine. He doesn't understand that things that are red in color are sometimes dyed with fruits and veggies, and sometimes dyed with red-40, which makes him projectile vomit everywhere.\n\nWe have to generally celebrate at places we can bring our own food, or somewhere we know pretty well that we can get around the dietary restrictions on all of our parts. My husband is also now on a strict muscle building/fat loss diet, and won't be able to eat a damn thing on that menu.\n\nAt this point I'm just kinda blah about it. There's so much wrong in this specific scenario that frustrates me to no end. I've been saying for years we need to get the hell out of this state and away from our parents, because they've done nothing but hurt our relationship. When we had less contact with everyone, we did SO much better.", "honestly, I would consider skipping the party, sweetly telling your husband that you\u2019re spending the night at a nice hotel, and letting him deal with the aftermath of your child spewing from both ends.  You probably don\u2019t want to do that to your kid though.", "Oh no.", "There is no way in the universe I could live like this for even a month. This situation is going to eventually escalate, because eventually he\u2019s going to want to spend more time away from grandma and with his friends or activities/sports. How about take him camping on the weekends? I\u2019d also make sure your house was incredibly inviting for kids/teens. How about a new job halfway across the country? \nYou have a big husband problem.", "I didn't, which is why I specifically said no to begin with. Two slices of pizza gives this kid diarrhea. It's a pizza place. That's what they serve for food. He likes pizza. Pizza does not like him. And he's too young to realize that at this point.", "I second this. Have a special something planned for another day with your son and let husband deal with it.", "Grandma threw a fit at my son's kindergarten play because my son showed preference over my husbands paternal grandmother, who he sees much less frequently than once a month.\n\nMy MIL literally streamed out of the room crying because my six year old \"hurt her feelings\" by wanting my husband's grandmother to watch him that specific Friday (I believe we had a funeral or other adult event to attend) instead of MIL. My son got chastised for hurting someone's feelings, which was incredibly fucking dumb in my opinion. Wanting to spend time with a family member we don't see as often and being upset about it doesn't warrant an almost 50 year old woman throwing a temper tantrum and crying in her vehicle.\n\nEdit: shitty spelling", "That's the other thing. My husband's biological father isn't much better, but he's not intentionally abusive or manipulative. He's just self absorbed. He lives 12 hours away and I've BEGGED my husband to move to be closer to bio FIL. I feel like if it wasn't the case that we lived 30 minutes away, a lot of this shit would resolve immediately.", "Have you tried finding pizza that likes him as much as he likes it? With like dairy-free cheese?", "Oh, you should just start preparing for a move. With or without him. Away from both in-laws. Then he can fly your son back and forth every weekend to his mommy\u2019s house.", "I wish I could. Unfortunately I'm also kind of stuck in a shitty financial position because he makes decent ass money and gets VA checks. But he works overnights, and the place he works doesn't follow a traditional schedule. I don't have contact with a lot of my family for various reasons (they're mostly just addicts tbh) and those I do have contact with work full time. There's no possible childcare option besides either of my husbands grandmother's, both of whom my MIL hate. I'm also responsible for basically all of the work inside the household, and traditionally when I've worked full time he hasn't picked up any of the slack at all. So I literally have panic attacks thinking about how filthy my house is because he won't help. For my own mental health and the sake of keeping my child as near to me as possible, I work a maximum of four 9 hour days outside of the house a week. I'm also writing a novel, which is my dream and really my ticket the fuck out if I can manage, but because it's not currently a prolific career my husband doesn't count it as work and will not help maintain our household anymore. I'm literally sinking in depression, financially I have like $60 bucks, and the last time I left him (because I have done it) I had far more money.\n\nI don't have access to his bank accounts for the fact that I took money from him in our marriage and spent money from our joint account in excess, which I understand to a degree."]}
