Everyone would go to the zoo, amusement park, or whatever we picked that year together. Now that my son is older, I'd intended to let him pick, but within reason.

My work schedule used to pretty specifically revolve around the fact they spend every weekend there. Now it doesn't and I'm working on publishing a novel as well as working out of the house a few days a week. Today they went for another birthday celebration for another family member, one who I will not speak to at all for the fact he falsely accused another man of r*pe to get out of being found drunk in a stranger's front yard. I'm not gonna go celebrate that. \ud83d\ude02", "I don't get the reasoning behind all these questions. Even  if the father and grandmother had good reasons to plan a trip to that place with the kid, they could have done it on another day than the actual birthday.

My husband basically made it clear he never intended to tell me, and doesn't think that it's f-d that that was his choice. I really don't know if I'd be welcome there by the other adults in this situation, and I'm not sure if that would make it a worse situation for my son.", "To answer your first question, our son had previously mentioned going to the place. I shut it down because it butts with a lot of restrictions in our household that are medical. He told grandma, who swooped in and made the plans and told my husband that's what she intended to do. My husband agreed, despite us having already talked about this previously, both of us agreeing we weren't going to that place, and replacing it with going to a zoo.\n\nTo answer the second question, my husband asked me if an outfit he had on was appropriate for a funeral, I told him yes. He had to call his mom to get a second opinion. This is FREQUENT. Any time I tell him anything, I'm immediately wrong until someone tells him the same thing.\n\nMy reaction to my son WAS because I was taken off guard, and he's a sarcastic noodle.

Sorry, not exactly sure how that would work or if a child can take that. \n\nI'm not saying you should endanger yourself to let your son go out, but it's a pretty terrible situation if he is restricted from normal childhood interactions just to keep you from catching an illness.

I know it's really hard for kids to isolate socially.", "Just out of curiosity, have you tried lactaid for you or your son?", "no i did change my mind.... sorry...maybe i was speed reading or maybe your tone seemed off... but my fiance has a similar situation,.. the family if her ex at times act like they are guardians and make plans without checking with mom, sometimes its innocent, sonetimes not.

Early in our marriage we also had other problems that my husbands mother had no issue digging her hands into and telling me her true feelings. It started because I got pregnant on birth control.
