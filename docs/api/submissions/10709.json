The audacity to send someone else in after you already essentially denied him might be a sign that he is just oblivious but the chances of that are slim.", "NTA. But also tell your boss, document shit with them and HR, and then bring your stuff home. People are getting too entitled and you and Mina are not in a position to say no without ruining goodwill, so bring it home and just explain that people were getting too entitled so you had to put a pin on it. Maybe go for a coffee run with Mina before work instead or during lunch.", "NTA OP and now take all of your coffee stuff home for a few days.  Let Mina in on what's going on.  Once you have taken action and they can't have \"special coffee\" anymore, they'll need to go back to whatever it was they were drinking.  You're not their barista, you're not their secretary, you're their to work.  Tell them that because they were so demanding and that nobody asked if it was ok to use your personal stuff, they don't get to reap the benefits of that coffee anymore.", "NTA. Guuuurrrl, you better go straight to HR and TELL THEM EVERYTHING!", "NTA\n\n\nPost like these really help me understand why my family says I'm the blunt one of the bunch. I would of told him I'm too busy to remember his order and to call coffee lady himself..  also don't touch my stuff.", "Nta", "You're his coworkers, not his personal baristas. He can get his own stuff and make his own. NTA", "NTA and I would go to flow this behavior up to your manager and HR.  They're stealing your personal items and making coffee for your asshat co-worker isn't in any of your job descriptions.", "NTA", "I'd tell him he knows what Mina puts in it so he should buy his own stuff for his own office. It's not your responsibility to keep providing him multiple cups of coffee a day.\n\nThose are your resources that you and Mina purchased for yourselves. Who cares if he ranks higher than you. He probably makes more money and should be able to do it himself.", "this seems like an obvious bait haha.", "NTA! But you and Mina need to STOP keeping coffee where everyone feels comfortable taking it from you and making demands for what you paid for out of your own money. Make it so there is only enough for the 2 of you. You both and the other co-worker all need to go to human resources and let it be known that Mr. entitled clearly doesn't have enough work to do since he needs 3 - 4 coffee breaks per day and at your expense. GTFOH! NTA!", "Nta. Bill him for the coffee. It\u2019s not free and not provided by your employer.", "Agreed.  Maybe record/document the interaction somehow as well, just in case as evidence.", "This.

Too many woman are taught to just not make noise but this stuffs affects how people see it treat you. Never be the help", "Thank you. Some of these suggestions on what to do are paragraphs long. Say \u201cfuck off\u201d in an HR friendly way and move on.", "I recommend this as well. Handle it yourself first and if he escalates, you escalate as well and go to your boss, if your boss doesn't handle it, go to HR", "I was going to say for her to SPIT in the coffee. Less mess and it look like she's so smelling the coffee very close...", "Exlax....", "One of the awesome things about not having to work in an office anymore is not having random dudes expecting me to make coffee for them in a self-service break room whenever I happen to be the closest female to the coffee pot. This garbage is so disrespectful and disruptive especially when it's while you're working or just grabbing a cup really quick to bring back to your desk (and they always pout and get weird about it if you don't or aren't perky enough about it the times it's safer to just do it).", "[deleted]", "Both.", "That wouldn\u2019t have the effect you want it to - you would be seen as the \u201ccoffee women,\u201d not competent professionals who happen to like good coffee.\n\nReport this to HR.
