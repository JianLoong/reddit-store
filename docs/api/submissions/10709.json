We decided to bring some coffee, creamer, coffee spices, cocoa, etc. because - in the shared kitchen - coffee lady (or however you call it) makes black coffee only, and us two we adore coffee of all sorts. We have a kettle, two spoons, and two mugs.\n\nSeveral days ago, a co-worker comes to our office. He has a higher rang in the company and sees we brought this stuff. The woman, let's call her Mina, then offers him a cup of coffee which he happily accepts. Some days after, he literally bursts into our office with almost an order to Mina to make him another one of our coffee, because that one the other day was awesome. Mina says yes, makes his coffee, and takes it to his office.\n\nA couple of hours later, he comes in again: \"*Make me another one.\".* Mina was not so pleased with this, and she was in the middle of her work, but she says *OK* and makes it and delivers it again.\n\nAn hour later he comes in again and asks for another half of the cup of the same coffee. Mina is now visibly disturbed and irritated but she says okay. *\"I'll be in my office.\"*, says he and closes the door. Mina looks at me and says *3rd time is already too much, I am not sure how to react, this is not my job*. I advised her to make this one last coffee and next time just tell him that he can have this cup of special coffee when he visits us in our office. Polite and pretty clear.\n\nTwo days ago, I was alone in the office and he comes again with a demand for this coffee. I was hesitant because I cannot believe he just demands it. I told him I don't know what coffee Mina made for him. Then he explains o*ne spoon of this, one and a half of that*... And I stare at him in wonder because this is neither a caf\u00e9 nor a restaurant nor am I a coffee lady. I smiled and offered politely to call the coffee lady to make him some coffee. Then he asks: *''She can use your coffee and spices and kettle and all...?''*. I was like: *''Umm... She can?''*. *''Okay, call her''*, says him but I see he is in shock I refused.\n\nThen to make it even more, funnier just as I grabbed the phone to call the coffee lady, which we do all the time, another co-worker comes in and without asking or anything grabs our kettle and **Mina's personal mug** and starts making coffee. Not a single word she said. I was confused so I asked: *''Um... Are you making coffee for yourself?''*. And then she says *no*, she makes it for the co-worker (whom I refused to make coffee 15 seconds ago). I asked: *''But why you...? Isn't coffee lady supposed to do that?''*. And then with visible disturbance on her face, she says she knows and it is better not to say anything.\n\nWtf? He is not even our boss. And it is rude just to demand. And it is not our duty to make him special coffees. Sure, we can, but it is our goodwill not duty. So... AITA?\n\np.s. I also don't have any additional mugs or spoons, that is all in the kitchen. And Mina and I bought this for ourselves at work.

The next time he asks, I'd explain that you made him a cup of YOUR special coffee a few times out of courtesy, but these are your coffee supplies that you and your colleague paid for out of your own pockets and since it seems like he wants to use them on a regular basis, he'll need to chip in x amount of money per month going forward if he wants more. He'll also need to make the coffee himself, since his frequent requests are starting to interfere with your ability to do the work you're all employed to do. Same deal for any other coworkers who want to drink the special coffee. \n\nOne of two things will probably happen - these people will either start paying for their own coffee or they won't want to pay for it and will leave you alone.
