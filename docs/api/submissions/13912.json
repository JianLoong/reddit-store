You fucked up. \n\nInstead of doing ANY research on genetics you immediately jumped to accusing her of cheating. Not only cheating, but cheating and then having a *child* with the person she cheated with. That\u2019s a wild accusation to make with no thought or care. Protection also fails quite often. I know multiple women, including myself, that have gotten pregnant while using protection. \n\nYou are 24, it is unacceptable for you to be this ignorant on sex ed. But for you to jump immediately to cheating most likely did a lot of damage to your relationship. The whole \u201c1 in 3 fathers aren\u2019t the real father\u201d thing makes me think you just hate women lol. That statistic seems entirely made up. You\u2019re telling me 1/3 of ALL fathers aren\u2019t the actual father of their child? Are you desperately trying to get Andrew Tate out of jail too? \n\nYou need to grow up and stop listening to whatever alpha male podcast you get your info from. No, not every man has that fear. You are a bad person in this moment for this.", "YTA if those were your only reasons to be suspicious. Most babies have blue eyes at first and no contraceptive is 100% effective.", "1 in 3??? wtf is that pal. You sound like you are making up facts to support you being an AH. I'll bet you had some friends whispering in your ear that you were right to do it too.", "so quick question\u2026 you don\u2019t understand that there\u2019s NO protection out there that is 100% effective against pregnancies/std\u2019s? and if so, why did you not learn this prior to starting to have sex?", "YTA. The 1in3 stat you gave is 100% wrong. If you were insecure, then fine get the test, but your gf is right that you've shown you don't trust her and your insecurity is more important than your relationship.", "Why did you announce this to her?  Why not just quietly do the test?  They sell them at CVS.", "Did you know that most babies are born with blue eyes?", "YTA basing it all on eye colour. Also no birth control is 100%. I don\u2019t no a single person who\u2019s has demanded or even wanted a dna test on their child tbh either. It\u2019s pretty much unheard of here apart from people wanting to try and get out of child support or that the mother was definitely sleeping around, or rich people inheriting due to being a bastard child kinda thing.", "YTA - Many babies have blue eyes when they are born and then they change.  My Spawn had blue eyes and after a few months they changed to brown.  There is a chance of both of you carry the recessive gene for blue eyes (Yes, this depends on your genetic makeup of course).  Please educate yourself before you try to procreate again.", "yta ... did you go  to school in some christian conservative backwards state that removed science from the curriculum... im guessing you wont need to worry about your girlfriend cheating on you anymore .... since you wont have one for long", "YTA. Google genetics. Your gf has every right to be angry. And no, not all men question their child\u2019s paternity.", "YTA. There are many things you don't understand that are true. Including that your \"protections\" don't work perfectly all of the time. \n\nI'm sorry you've managed to reproduce. That's going to drag down the population intelligence level in the long run. \n\nHere's a hint - if you want to avoid getting a future girlfriend pregnant, and want to ensure there's no chance, then you don't get to put your dick in her. Ever. If you DO, and then accuse her of sleeping with someone else, you do not deserve a relationship. \n\nI hope she moves on, with or without the fetus.", "Im gonna say YTA here (which is rare, since I usually end up saying NTA when many are saying YTA).  \n\nFirst of all, blue iris pigment a recessive gene, so it's perfectly reasonable for two brown eyes parents to have a blue eyed child.  It's a little rare, as both parents need to be heterogenous Bb in this regard and pass the recessive allele (**heavily** simplified), but it's perfectly plausible.  \n\nThe reason I'm saying YTA though is that your reasoning for the accusation was just \"1 in 3 Dads are raising a child that's not biologically theirs.\"  Putting aside the validity of any source you may pulled that from, you're just viewing your partner as a statistic - NOT an individual.  There's no critical thought about when she may have cheated, why she may have cheated or who she may have cheated *with*.  This is a fundamental problem with you as a person and you NEED to work on this.", "YTA. That\u2019s not how genetics work. Of course she\u2019s offended.", "Ok, first, you don't understand genetics, nor do your understand how eye color changes during the first year of life.\n\nSecond, 1 in 3 men aren't the father? Where the hell did you pull that from?\n\nThird, yea she's mad. You accused her of cheating. Wouldn't you be mad too if she accused you of cheating, and demanded you to prove you didn't cheat?\n\nJfc, yea YTA", "Not every man fears that the child isn't his. There's no way you have evidence that \"1 in 3 'fathers' are not the actual father.\" \n\nYes, YTA. You wanted an easy out to an unexpected pregnancy and damaged your relationship in the process.", "YTA. I advice you to both go to couples counseling before it gets worst. You guys will be happy after you break-up. But the poor child will suffer.", "So what you both had brown eyes? Blue eyes are a recessive gene. Lots of brown-eyed parents have blue-eyed kids. It's literally the example they use to teach genetics to 12 year olds.", "YTA but I will say that paternity tests should be mandatory", "YTA for sure.", "Blue eyes are a recessive trait, so they could pop up anywhere. Just because you used protection doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have a child. Read the box, it says 99.9% effective. You seem like one huge red flag.", "I looked at my own kid who I just popped out and she was NOTHING like me or her dad. She had dark curly hair and we were both fair haired blond people. I did not cheat. She has gone through periods where she has been both our minis. Point is, you can\u2019t tell at birth. \n\nAndrew Tate much? YTA", "1 in 3 fathers? YTA for that alone.\n\nAlso, YTA for having no understanding of generics or baby eye color and the inability to do a Google search on nay of this instead of getting your info from Incel/MRA sources.\n\nSounds like she is better off without you.", "YTA. My guy here probably didn\u2019t do too hot with punnet squares in high-school biology\u2026nor in health class (although I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was no health class to learn about how protection sometimes fails). \n\nYou owe her a major apology. For being both ignorant and an AH.", "YTA, unless there was a history of infidelity why wouldn't you trust her? Also how soon after the baby was born did you \"demand\" this? Eyes can take 6-12 months to settle on their true colour, my nephew's eyes were grey at birth and he also has brown eyes (not even getting started on recessive genes). Also the only way to 100% avoid pregnancy is to just not have sex. I missed one pill while sick and now I have a 6yo, it happens.", "NTA. It's not anywhere as bad as 1 in 3, btw, (*maybe* as bad as 1 in 10, at worst) but still NTA.", "I think it\u2019s very possible your girlfriend is making plans to leave you. YTA", "YTA. Babies often have blue eyes at first. Contraception fails regularly. You are so fucking stupid and should be ashamed of yourself.", "you do realize that babies  eye color changes sometimes also", "YTA. Maybe apologies for your trust issues and do the work to rebuild the trust in the relationship.", "That\u2019s not how dna works. You can have a blue eyed child if you both have brown eyes. Lol. Plus condoms aren\u2019t 100 percent effective.", "YTA, we need better sex education", "YTA. The amount of ignorance and immaturity you\u2019ve displayed in this situation is wild. All it takes is one tear in a condom, which if you were actively having sex on a regular basis, is quite possible. That\u2019s even if you\u2019re telling the truth in that you never had unprotected sex. You both having brown eyes is irrelevant, you need to properly educate yourself on how genetics actually work.\n\nThe statistic you pulled is also irrelevant. You accused your girlfriend of a serious act, treated her as guilty without a shred of evidence, and massively betrayed her because you didn\u2019t want the child to be yours, which seems to be the real issue here. You projected onto your pregnant girlfriend so you didn\u2019t have to look like the bad guy.", "NTA Because you have every right to put your fears at rest to know for a fact that it is your child. She's gonna be upset but that's not her fault it's the condom company \ud83d\ude02 You might as well not used it if it's gonna happen anyway", "Looks like you FAAFO. You had a baseless fear and now have accused your gf of an unforgivable act. Now you have your reassurance but it\u2019s very likely she breaks up with you. I know if my hubby came at me with an unsubstantiated request like that I\u2019d do the same. YTA", "NTA. You ALWAYS have a right to know paternity for certain. Knowing for sure isn't calling her a cheater -- it's accepting that life is sometimes cruel to us. Now you know for sure and that's awesome. Forget about the eye colour thing -- that's a recessive gene so she could certainly be yours and now you know she is. Don't listen to these people saying yta. They don't get it.", "NTA. So you know for sure she is your child. That's good. And considering that some states make you pay for a child even if it is proven that it is not yours, but you sadly figured it out too late - it is reasonable to ask for a DNA test. But I also see your girlfriends side. It can be considered as a lack of trust.\n\nBy the way it is common that many newborns have blue eyes and that their eyes turn darker after time", "YTA. No birth control is 100% effective. At least you established paternity so when your girlfriend leaves it will easy for her to get child support.", "YTA and obviously uneducated in several ways.", "YTA - holy shit you learn this in freshman biology. Google a punnet square and get your \u201cfacts\u201d from more than one source because that one in three stat is wrong. Your girlfriend has every right to be pissed at you!", "YTA. \n\nFirst off, this can be explained with a simple Punnett square. It\u2019s the other way around that can\u2019t happen. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m going to guess you got that \u201cfigure\u201d about paternity from a less than reputable source. If anything, this made up stat is reported as fact by a lot of misogynistic idiots who were given a microphone. \n\nThird, no, most men don\u2019t worry about the paternity of their children. Again, this is often reported by misogynists with microphones. And accusing her of cheating based on what an idiot with a microphone says does, in fact, make you a bad person. \n\nYour girlfriend has every right to be pissed. You need to grow up.", "YTA\n\nIf your only evidence are the eyes. And no protection is 100% safe", "YTA. A massive one. You doubted your girlfriend\u2019s loyalty even though she gave you no reason for it, and it went as far as actually taking a DNA test? I\u2019d dump you faster than you can learn about recessive genes.", "As a middle school science teacher, I want to apologize in behalf of my entire profession. \n\nAlso, YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re getting riled up because your baby has blue eyes and neither of you don\u2019t? Didnt you pay attention in high school???\n\nBlue eyes need both genes to be recessive, if both of you have one dominant brown gene and one recessive blue gene then your kid as a chance of getting those blue eyes, you absolute dumbass.", "YTA. Contraception isn't 100% even when used perfectly.  Oh, and Caucasian babies are almost always born with blue or gray eyes, and they could darken as they age.  My daughter had blue eyes when she was born and they are now hazel like both mine & my husband's.  You need to apologize - and honestly if she were me, I don't know that I could forgive you for making such an outlandish claim.\n\nOh, and you want to talk about a \"stretch\", THIS is a stretch:\n\n> 1 in 3 \u201cfathers\u201d are not the actual father of their child, so it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a stretch.", "Yta and if I was your gf, you'd be my ex.  You clearly don't trust her.", "YTA. Most babies are actually born with blue eyes because their bodies don\u2019t have enough of the material\nneeded to reflect their \u201ctrue\u201d eye color.

Where did you get that totally incorrect info? Also: \"every man fears that his child isn\u2019t really his\". SERIOUSLY???

It\u2019s definitely not a fear that every man has. If she has no history of cheating, and your only \u201cproof\u201d is that your baby has blue eyes then\u2026 you literally have no idea how genetics work either. 2 brown-eyed parents can have a baby with basically any colour of eyes. \n\nAlso, your \u201c1 in 3\u201d reach is total nonsense.

First, that 1 in 3 stat, if at all accurate, seems super skewed. Second, I'm freaking brown and my kid was born with blue eyes - most babies are. They don't usually last.

Two brown-eyed parents can easily have a blue-eyed baby that grown into a blue-eyed adult.  So it doesn't matter if the baby's eyes change colour or not.", "Yup! Blue is recessive so double blue will produce blue (although there is a minuscule chance for green.) \n\nTwo brown eyed parents can carry genes for blue eyes, but they will show brown. Most likely their offspring will have brown eyes, but there is a chance for green and blue (if they carry the recessive blue.)\n\nEither way, this stuff is taught in middle school. OP basing concerns off of eye color is laughable.\n\nThe main thing, though, is that eye color can also change. It just seems like OP is overall misinformed about sex, children, genetics, etc., and frankly it\u2019s a bit scary that he has a kid.", "Yep, I was born with blue eyes, they stuck around for a little bit and then turned hazel.", "Yeah, baby\u2019s eye color is not considered to be their permanent eye color until they are a year old anyway because it\u2019s so common for baby blues to morph into other colors", "Oh I believe it.  I work in a science related field and have had to take statistics.  Unless someone has evidence to back up their claim, it is unsubstantiated, and, I will assume made up", "Not this commenter literally being married to the living, breathing proof of the blue-eyed blond recessive genes in their family tree and still blaming her daughter-in-law for hypothetically cheating because their grandchild had said recessive genes \ud83d\ude02", "Right? Despite the baby\u2019s grandfather having those exact traits \u201cwe all wonder\u201d smh.", "Even later! My first borns\u2019 eyes went from light blue to green to brown around 4 years old", "nah there is it called licking her boots until the baby 3.", "He rolled the dice with choosing to get the test instead of trusting his girlfriend. He weighed the odds.", "My son was born with very very dark brown eyes, almost black. They are now crystal blue. Eye color can change from brow to blue.", "Only that one isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t tell him.", "I understand the faulty biological reasoning OP is using just fine. It doesn't matter that it's flawed or what the reason is at all\n\nOk, so what I said about if male infidelity could deceive women into raising someone else's baby: If that was the case, would you respect men enough to trust them?\n\nIt's about human nature. How terribly naive and sheltered of you. I'm sure you're very -N-ice though", "I was just having a giggle at your expense. I figured you had missed that detail.", "He quite literally said he thought she cheated. \n\n> So I started to think that she cheated on me and I wasn\u2019t the real father.", "I mean depending on when they take the DNA the baby can still be mixed up after", "No mate, no one has the right to demand things without consequences. He can ask, but he has to now live with the consequences of accusing his (hopefully ex) girlfriend of potentially cheating.", "Meln", "My son's were solidly blue till about 6-8 months, but have creeped to an interesting shade of honey brown. Lil sis had blue for just a month or so and hers are now dark brown. Mine are blue, hubs are dark brown.", "But he used protection. It would be idiotic to think that she was pregnant by him given the facts. He did the thing to protect from pregnancy and it didn't work. I get you stand point of it being a \"trust your girl\" moment but if he didn't have unprotected sex, he's not thinking he could have gotten her pregnant. Go to any judged would understand his doubts.", "Fraternal twins from different dads are not all that common, congrats! You didn't waste any time \ud83d\ude09", "Yes, I absolutely would trust my partner that our child is ours because I understand biology better than you do and didn't fail my Punnett squares section of the textbook. It absolutely does matter that the fundamental logic is flawed, because OP is baselessly accusing his partner of cheating which is going to not only ruin their relationship but the potential for a relationship he could have had with his child\n\nI'm quite nice to people who aren't assholes, thank you very much. Shame I couldn't be nice to you though", "No worries i appreciate the observation.", "Well yeah that\u2019s why NAH. No Assholes Here. He lost ultimately so his GF isn\u2019t an asshole either. That was always a possibility too.", "It would be idiotic to believe protection is 100% effective.", "Any judge would point out that no form of protection minus abstinence is 100%", "Then what's the point \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Please tell me you\u2019re a 14 year old virgin\u2026", "How'd you know \ud83d\ude31", "Abstinence is the only 100% effective protection from pregnancy.. I'm sure they'll cover that in health class for that guy soon."]}
