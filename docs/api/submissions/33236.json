She agreed. She was over at our house at this time and I was really struggling to get my baby to sleep. That\u2019s when she mentioned that last time she had him, she put a tiny bit of whiskey in his milk bottle to help him sleep. She said that she did it with all her kids too. Now, I know that it was pretty common for parents to do this in the past, my grandma even put whiskey on my gums when I was teething as a child so I assumed she didn\u2019t know that this wasn\u2019t okay to do anymore. \n\nI didn\u2019t get angry or anything, and just asked her if she knew that it wasn\u2019t acceptable to do anymore.

When you told her this she was contrite, genuine and committed to never repeating her mistake. I think your husband is over reacting. You can't change the past. But MIL seemed sincere in her regret and commitment to do better going forward. There was no malice. She is human. Your reaction was perfectly appropriate. NTA", "NTA. And don\u2019t take the kid to get checked out or you will be answering a lot of questions you probably don\u2019t want to answer", "Oh for heaven\u2019s sake, your husband is totally overreacting. Parents back in the day did their best with what they knew at the time. You asked MIL not to do it again, she apologized, problem solved. Why does he want to make her feel worse or deprive your son of his grandmother?  Sounds like a him problem to me, but he is also the child\u2019s father so his concerns should be taken into consideration. You and he need to discuss this and come to an agreement. NTA.", "NTA I had whiskey on my gums too, your husband grew up in a different generation and he was blissfully oblivious that he\u2019d even had it. Your MIL was immediately open to change and what you want for your baby and he\u2019s being stubborn. Tell him your health comes first.", "Nah you're fine. She was a bit out of date on a practice, you filled her in, she apologised, nobody got hurt. I'm not saying it's ok that she did it in the first instance, but it's good that she won't do it again and your husband, despite his best intentions, is overreacting.\n\nBeware the doomsayers in this thread that will say \"omg that's child abuse have her arrested\" and \"wait, your husband is 46?? Sounds like he's a controlling abuser exploiting your lack of life experience\" and so on. Your mother in law is of the generation where you do your best with what you have, and what info you have to hand, rather than consulting a million different instruction manuals on raising a child via Google.", "NTA,\n\nYour husband is my age group.. he is absolutely away with the fairies, if he didn't know or even suspect that it was a done thing back in the day.. \n\nThere wasn't a myriad of these other options or solutions back then.. or the Oracle Google to go to.. \n\nAnd when it was done BTW.. it was always only minuscule amounts for numbing.. they didn't get baby or toddlers pissed drunk..", "NTA. \nMaybe you could ask your husband and his mum to stay together for a few hours to look after the baby which would give him the opportunity to observe if there are any other things she does that are unacceptable/unsafe and tell her calmly that she shouldn\u2019t do it again for this this reason. \nYou seem to have a good relationship with your MIL which is rare, and she agreed with you about the whisky thing, so you have to find a way to make your husband and his mum be on good terms so that your baby can see a positive family image growing up. Many of us got a taste of whisky as a baby, it\u2019s not acceptable now which we know but for the older generation it was a done thing and it\u2019s a huge deal when they actually agree with us instead of defending themselves. \nGood luck with your recovery, hope you are doing well now", "This was a genuine mistake, your MIL sincerely apologises and seems upset she did something wrong. \n\nThis is all good things and means that she will think twice in future and listen to your way of childcare. I wouldn\u2019t go scorched earth on her for this. \n\nHowever, your husband has not offered to take time off and be the sitter so you can have your appointment. It seems he only has principles as long as YOU are the person inconvenienced by them.", ">Now, he wants me to tell her that she can\u2019t watch my son next week and he\u2019s asking that i reschedule my appointment to his day off so he can look after our son. I really need this appointment to prevent further complications to my health and I truly don\u2019t believe MIL was being malicious, she was just behind on the times. He\u2019s upset that i won\u2019t listen to him.\n\nNTA. If your husband is really genuinely concerned and thinks his mother can't be trusted, he can take a sick day when your appointment is due and look after his baby.  \n\n\nSo long as he's only concerned enough to endanger your health rather than inconvenience himself, he isn't really that concerned. Point that out to him, and ask him to decide if he's concerned *enough* that he feels he should take a sick day rather than let his mother look after his baby single-handed. If not, well,  I agree with you that she sounds sensible enough and won't do it again.", "NTA. Your husband sounds like he's overreacting. Be careful of your health - go to your appointment!", "Does he have any reason to believe his mother would not follow through on her promise not to do it again? Otherwise I feel like this is a NAH. He obviously has valid concerns about the situation, but you need follow up care to your emergency room visit, and if you truly believe there is no danger to your child then that should be a priority.", "What\u2019s his plan for childcare? Is he gonna watch your kid? NTA MIL definitely needs a primer on modern childcare but she seems open to change.", "NAH\nDue a baby in the next few weeks and my MIL told me last week that holding the baby \"too much\" would \"spoil\" them... I just nodded my head because we know that's incorrect now and she won't be caring for my baby so it's a non issue. I don't think what your MIL did was malicious and she was obviously so embarrassed by it she's not going to do it again.  Your husband is overreacting.", "NTA. \n\nIf your husband is concerned he can take a sick day (surgeons have sick time) or deal with it. She apologized and indicated she wouldn't do it again. That is the end of it. Your husband doesn't seem to be putting your health on the priority list.", "NTA. It seems like she didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t try to hide it at all and I think that\u2019s says a lot about a person.", "Nah you good. MIL's just old school, ain't no biggie. Get yo appointment done and don't let anyone guilt trip ya for it.", "NTA there were many things done in the past that we would consider harmful these days and since many grandparents don't know that what they did is no longer ok, they often do it out of ignorance. You've let your MIL know, she's very apologetic about doing so and as long as she doesn't do it again, then it's fine. Your husband is overreacting.", "NTA\n\nYou MIL shows regret and does not come in discussion at all when you told her it was not okay. That is a very good sign because she wants the best for her grandchild. Your husband is putting your health aside so he can watch the baby. That is ridiculous imo. The mothers health comes first. And you believe that you MIL is capable of taking care. Try to talk to your mother in law about some agreements with taking care of a baby and problem will be solved in a minute. Your MIL knows what the limit is and you husband won\u2019t overreact anymore.", "NTA. Your husband is being daft. It\u2019s a joint decision, but your opinion is just as valid as his, and if he is being an idiot, you are justified in calling him on it!", "The 46 year old is mad that his 25 yo wife won\u2019t do what he tells her to do? Shocking. Why does he want you to talk to her? She\u2019s his mother. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to react this way at every misstep by a caregiver you will never have one.", "NTA.  She sounds genuinely sorry that she did that and it was just an ignorant mistake on her part which she's apologised for. You also need to keep your medical appointment.  Would your husband be OK if you just removed all the alcohol from your house while she's there just to be on the safe side? It's weird that he has less faith in his own mother than you do.", "NTA", "NTA - MIL sounded sincere that she's learned her lesson and won't do it again.  It's probably easier for your husband to rearrange his schedule than switching your appointment.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s going to do it again.  I\u2019d be more concerned if she dug in her heels or didn\u2019t apologize.  But it does make me wonder how much other out of date parenting stuff she\u2019s doing.  I\u2019d probably keep the appointment, but make time beforehand to do a quick run down of basics that you know have changed since she was a parent.  Back to sleep, no kissing, no cereal or solid foods, etc.  NTA", "NTA\n\nMIL used an outdated method. She has apologized and seems fairly horrified at what she did. \n\nShe has never intended any harm to your child and seems quite committed to never doing it again. \n\nMaybe help her confidence (and yours and husbands) and invite her over for a day with you to go over all the routines and preferences you have for raising your child.", "NTA.  You raised an issue with your MIL, you talked it over, she agreednot to do the whiskey remedis again, and that is the end of the issue.", "NAH. Your MIL didn\u2019t know but was apologetic, you were surprised but handled things excellently, your husband is a first-time dad who had a freak out, which happens. Hopefully once he calms down, he\u2019ll see that his mom didn\u2019t mean to do anything wrong.\n\nGlad you have a great MIL, btw! Congrats on the new baby, and I hope your ER follow-up appt (which you absolutely should go to) goes well.", "Your husband is massively overreacting. You told your MIL it's not approved anymore, she completely listened, heard you, and sincerely apologized. There really is no better outcome than that. \n\nHe seems to care more about his little grievance over finding out his mother did that with him as a child, than he does about your health. \n\nNTA, but your husband is.", "NTA people make mistakes but at the same time, child has two parents and decisions about the child should be agreed upon", "You MIL apologized and even went so far as to suggest that you have the baby checked out, although I believe that is totally unnecessary at this point, and she obviously undersands that this practice is no longer considered acceptable. It would be cruel not to allow her to babysit and this would also punish you.
