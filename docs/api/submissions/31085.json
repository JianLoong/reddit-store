We live in a small apartment to save up for marriage and one day children. We are very happy together, he doesn\u2019t have a very good relationship with his parents but he has a sister. She has a disability and he has always been extremely caring over her. He has always been the type to get me presents when I\u2019m feeling down. He has got me a octopus plush and a beautiful necklace, it was rose gold and i wore it all the time it\u2019s the prettiest thing I own. His sister always took an interest in the necklace due to the shine. She came over to look at the necklace. I let her put it on and she loved it. The next day it was gone, I looked all over the house meanwhile my boyfriend did nothing but say \u201cit\u2019ll turn up\u201d it clicked in my head that it was obvious is sister took it but I was late for work so I left. On my way home I decided to stop by at my boyfriends moms and I was asking about their daughter and they said she was upstairs and I was talking to her when I saw it on her neck and politely asked for it back but she refused claiming it was hers and she\u2019s not giving it back. I left raging without saying goodbye. I came in and told my boyfriend and he sat and defended her. I left and spent the night at my parents later that day I got a message from my boyfriends mom and she explained that it was completely out of order that even after my boyfriend gave it to her I came storming in and demanding it back.  I messaged back and explained I had no idea my boyfriend gave it to her and I had lost it and wasn\u2019t happy because I wore it all the time. She hasn\u2019t answered. Am I the bad person? UPDATE I may have taken it too far? As most of you suggested ( you are all so sweet \ud83d\udc97) I take something I gifted to him and give it away, which is exactly what I did. He has a gaming chair and I gave it to my sisters son (14 M) and he loved it! He came home from his business trip and was asking me where it was to which I responded with \u201cit\u2019ll turn up\u201d. His mother had then messaged me abuse ( I haven\u2019t responded ) he said if he doesn\u2019t get it back he will leave me. His sister came to my door a couple hours later telling me how unreasonable I was, I then explained how I didn\u2019t know  he had given the necklace to her and politely asked for it back, she then hit me and and kept the necklace and stormed off muttering under her breath. I am now living with my parents. His mother is now repeatedly calling me and messaging me abuse, just shows how immature people can be regardless of age. AITA?

Your boyfriend should have immediately communicated with you about what happened to your necklace if he did give it away or his sister took it, regardless if he planned to replace it or not. That behavior, failing to set boundaries with his sister and therefore stealing from you to give to her is a big red flag. If it\u2019s indicative of how he will treat you in the future it doesn\u2019t seem very functional (unless he recognizes and acknowledges his mistake and learns to communicate with you clearly.)

Now if \"raging\" means like swearing and name calling, that's not good and probably inappropriate. \n\nBut honestly, I don't care what \"raging\" means in this case, because the bottom line is this: Your stuff is not safe in your own home because your boyfriend will not keep it safe. He will defend his sister over you even when she is wrong, or he will happily give away your stuff and then get mad at you when you are upset about it. In a way, I think I would be okay with my boyfriend giving his disabled sister something of mine, IF he told me and replaced it.

I'm pretty sure this would end the relationship though. \nBut personally, I wouldn't want to be with someone who either went behind my back and gave away my things or allowed his family memeber to steal my things, regardless of mental or physical  capacity.", "His sister's disability shouldn't enter into this.

If you don't want to deal with that situation then you better bail now. Boyfriend will definitely end up moving her in and will expect you to care for her. Alot of people take in their disabled siblings because of cost and because they don't want to risk accidentally placing them in an abusive home.

Rather, she took it, and when you told him, he justified her actions by assuming that if he HAD given it to her, that would have been ok, therefore you should treat the incident as if he had given it to her. Since he had already given it to you, however, he had no right to give it to her. Either she stole it, or he stole it, either way, it should be returned to you because it is your property.

You need to put on your big girl pants and make a decision: Do you go talk to the BF and see if you can work things out, or do you toss 9 years of a relationship over the necklace. The critical question, if this happened to me, would be whether I had had similar incidents of casual lies from my significant other or not. If this is a pattern, then that's a huge red flag.

That will just set him up to be taken advantage of, and by extension you too.

The problem with that line of thinking is that there's a disconnect between the able-bodied person's experience and their *idea* of the disabled person's experience.\n\nThe able-bodied person is thinking something along the lines of, \"How would I feel if i suddenly couldn't (see, hear, walk, whatever)?\" Many disabled people, myself included, have been disabled since birth or a very young age, so our condition is the only thing we know. There really is no comparison. The best explanation I can come up with is that the able-bodied person feels bad that they get to be able-bodied, so they try to make up for it by \"cheering up\" the disabled person, telling them they're just like everyone else \"_**but**_...\" (which makes no sense at all), or indulging them.\n\nDon't waste your time trying to make the family see any kind of reason; they're all set in their ways and will push back.

That is extremely relevant where someone is often defined by what they can't do (even if unintentionally or subconsciously).\n\nI'd never suggest that every, or frankly even most, disabled people do this, regardless of the kind of disability but this behaviour is pretty textbook stuff and I've seen this dynamic in action often enough to feel confident guessing at the 'whys'.", "This ^ this us what OP should be doing.", "They didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  No one is going to do anything to a disabled girl who was given a present from her brother.  All of this fall squarely on him to resolve", "I know, the person I\u2019m replying too said it\u2019s what they would do.", "I think that it is actually \"receiving stolen property\" not \"receiving a gift\"", "Failure to teach a child right from wrong clearly places the family into the AH category. And for a lot more than just this necklace situation.", "Possession of stolen property is a crime, so once they knew it was stolen from OP, then not returning it is a crime.", "Once they knew it was stolen they should have given it back. Being disabled is not an excuse to keep someone else's property.", "You telling them the necklace is stolen would not be enough to convict them of being in possession of stolen property. How would they know you're not lying, furthermore unless you have the receipt how would the police know the necklace belongs to you?"]}
