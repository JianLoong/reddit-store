Your boyfriend should have immediately communicated with you about what happened to your necklace if he did give it away or his sister took it, regardless if he planned to replace it or not. That behavior, failing to set boundaries with his sister and therefore stealing from you to give to her is a big red flag. If it\u2019s indicative of how he will treat you in the future it doesn\u2019t seem very functional (unless he recognizes and acknowledges his mistake and learns to communicate with you clearly.)

Either way, toxic!\n\nYou lost your necklace, realized she probably took it, and asked about it. I don't know what \"raging\" means here, but I'd be pissed too and would probably not be kind in my conversation of trying to get something meaningful back. Now if \"raging\" means like swearing and name calling, that's not good and probably inappropriate. \n\nBut honestly, I don't care what \"raging\" means in this case, because the bottom line is this: Your stuff is not safe in your own home because your boyfriend will not keep it safe. He will defend his sister over you even when she is wrong, or he will happily give away your stuff and then get mad at you when you are upset about it. In a way, I think I would be okay with my boyfriend giving his disabled sister something of mine, IF he told me and replaced it. But everyone just wants you to accept that a personal item was stolen or given away and NO ONE told you the situation. \n\nI'd get out of this relationship if your boyfriend can't appreciate at all why this would make you upset.", "NTA.

He can't regift it without your consent, as that's theft.\n I would politely send a message to both him and the mom that since it was done without your consent, it was theft, and since the child is a) a child, and b) disabled, the parents and bf are legally liable and the text from mom is an admission that either sister or bf stole it and that it is currently in the possession of the child. I'm pretty sure this would end the relationship though. \nBut personally, I wouldn't want to be with someone who either went behind my back and gave away my things or allowed his family memeber to steal my things, regardless of mental or physical  capacity.", "His sister's disability shouldn't enter into this. Did your BF give it to her? That to me is the question that determines the outcome. If she just took it then she needs to be held accountable for that by your BF and by her mother. Plain and simple.", "Does he have a video game system? Do you know of someone who might enjoy it?\nNTA", "NTA - But this is what we call a \"dealbreaker\"\n\nIt's not so much the necklace, it's what it represents.

It was never his to give after he gave it to you!\n\nIf he wanted her to have one, he should have bought her one.

Just saying! \n\nReally, I would take his x box and put it in the trunk of my car. When he asked, I would tell him I gave it to Janie because she wanted it. When he started yelling I would go to the car and get it. As I handed it back, I would say now you know how I feel about the necklace. \n\nOf course I would add in that the necklace thing is worse.

Is it possible that it's actually a duplicate of the same necklace? His behavior doesn't make a lot of sense.", "NTA.

It teaches the kids to behave awfully and overall makes things more difficult for everyone involved. \n\nThe necklace is yours your BF had no right to give it away and his sister has no right to keep it. I\u2019d honestly report it as stolen and break up with him. I wouldn\u2019t trust someone that steals from you and gives away your things and lies to you about it.

It shows that your boyfriend has a massive lack of respect for you if he's willing to do something like that. That he lied about it also shows that he can't be trusted and what is a relationship worth without trust? In a sense you're probably lucky he showed you what he's really like before marriage instead of after. The smart thing to do would be to break up, even if that can be really hard 9 years in.

Honestly, I have never known a relationship work out where they dated over 4 years, unless they were older and neither one emphatically wanted marriage. There is usually a reason why they haven\u2019t gotten engaged and married.   \n\nYour bf gave his disabled sister the necklace he had given you, which you loved and wore daily. Then he lied to you and just said it would turn up. \n\nThis is egregious. \n\nHe gave YOUR necklace to someone else. A necklace that was supposed to be a symbol of his love for you. \n\nThe problem when people lower expectations on people with disabilities, is that it makes it harder for them to function in society. Proper caregivers expect attainable goals from them, standards that are within reach, but they have to work at. By expecting LESS than they are capable of, it stunts their social emotional learning and occupational therapy. \n\nHis sister has been raised to demand, and get, other people\u2019s things, and to get angry when the owner wants their things back. How will this serve her in the world, after her mother passes?\n\nSpeaking of which, what is the plan for her care when her mother passes? Will your bf become her primary caregiver, and you will be the housemaid?\n\nThis is a signal that you need to evaluate whether this relationship is right for you. Getting along well and being attracted to each other are just one aspect of compatibility. You also need to be compatible in, for example, being honest, mutual respect, and not giving away a partner\u2019s cherished possessions.", "Her parents constantly coddle her and she always gets her way.

Do you want to be in a relationship with a lying thief who does not respect you? You aren't going to want it back after you break up anyway, so let the necklace and him go.

This the man you want teaching your kids about morals?", "He gave it to her without my knowledge and I had to find this out of his mother", "None of that actually matters because it didn't belong to the boyfriend to give away even if he said she could have it. So that's what's called theft. Now understandable if she has some sort of cognitive disability that she might make a mistake and shouldn't be punished like a real thief.  but this should absolutely be used as a learning lesson for her that she can't just take what she wants, and he can't just give away other people's property.", "Even if the sister didn\u2019t \u201ctake\u201d it and the boyfriend \u201cgave\u201d it to her, the sister KNEW it belonged to OP, which in my mind implies she either asked bro for it or coerced him into offering.\n\nETA: and then LIED about it pretending to not know what happened to it!!", "The whole point is the bf lied and didn\u2019t mention he had given it to her. She was just confronting who, as far as she was aware, was a thief.
