{"id": 2471, "submission_id": "ywyzn8", "title": "AITA for spending $800 for concert tickets on behalf of my friends when they told me their hard limit was $300?", "selftext": "EDIT: I want to clarify that my friends wanted lower bowl seats (NOT nosebleeds) for $300. They thought the prices would be that range because of previous concerts from 4+ years ago even though I was skeptical since Taylor\u2019s become much more popular. Taylor announced nosebleeds would be $50 and floor $500 which is why they believed this. I was under a lot of pressure to either get the nosebleeds for several times what they wanted or the lower bowl for also much more, I made a quick decision under pressure. I also want to repeat that I spent only my own money and they DO NOT have to buy the tickets from me if they don\u2019t want to. If you check resell sites right now they could still get the worst seats for $300 but they don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m not a miracle worker, I can\u2019t deliver both quality of seats and price.\n\nI (30F) have a friend group of 6 people, and we\u2019re all Taylor Swift fans. Of course, we\u2019re all planning to go to her concert, but I was the only one to get a verified fan presale code, which means only I could buy tickets. Luckily they limit purchases to 6 a person, so I was tasked with buying all the tickets and getting my friends to pay me back.\n\nBefore sales were opened, we discussed how much money we were willing to spend. There\u2019s a decently large income discrepancy in the group, as I and another friend have high paying ($100k+) jobs while the others work in retail/serving or are in school. Two of us (me included) were willing to pay up to the thousands while the others didn\u2019t want to spend more than $100 to $200. I convinced them that there\u2019s no way in hell we could get decent tickets for that price We negotiated and settled on a hard cap of $300.\n\nDay of the presale it was a shitshow. I could literally see seats going unavailable in real time, and the website was displaying higher prices than expected. It was impossible to get anything other than nosebleed seats for under $300. I made the executive decision to get 6 lower bowl (not floor but closer to stage than upper) tickets that came out to $800 a person after fees.\n\nI told my friends what had happened and apologized for the price, but it was really get these tickets or none. Very soon after I checked out the shows in our location were completely sold out. Four of my friends are extremely upset with me, ranting that they agreed on $300. One went so far as to insist she would only pay me that much and demanded I cover the $500 difference and give her the ticket. I tried to be apologetic but they said some nasty things and I told them they could go to hell.\n\nIt would be easy to sell these tickets for face value, especially since online scalpers have pumped the prices up to $1k+ already. I\u2019m not worried about losing money and I told them so. My friend with the good job and I fully intend on going and having a good time regardless of what the other 4 decide. However, they\u2019ve been posting on social media and publicly dragging us, and some other friends are also calling me TA.

I think many of the people responding don\u2019t understand what a shit show it was yesterday for these tickets.\n\nYou likely couldn\u2019t have bought some seats for $300 and some for $800. So many people were trying to buy and tickets were disappearing from their cart.  It was nuts.\n\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t have had time to call/text them to discuss - again, it was nuts.\n\nYou were under no obligation to get them tickets.

You were able to get seats for $300, didn't, and are now threatening to scalp the tickets your friends trusted you to buy in your price range. You screwed them out of a concert because you decided to be selfish, and didn't even try to make it right.\n\nIf you were truly *only* able to get $800 tickets, bought them, and told your friends that's how the cookie crumbled, that would be one thing, but that isn't the case.\n\nE: To address OP's edit about the friends not wanting nosebleeds, I don't believe OP is being honest about that, because it was only added after OP tried defending herself other ways a half dozen times and laughed at the idea of screwing over one friend in particular by scalping her ticket. Even if OP is being honest about her friends being unreasonable, their initial comments *still* reveal them to be a tremendous AH.", "YTA. Your friends told you their hard limit, which afforded them nosebleed seats. But you wanted something better - and instead of \u201chey, I got us tickets! I wanted to treat everyone to a little upgrade, so the difference is on me!\u201d\n\nInstead you made the executive decision to purchase tickets which cost more than double what they can afford, while ALSO costing them the opportunity to have tickets they CAN afford in the nosebleed. \n\nWhat a friend!", "Info: why didnt you stick to the agreement? Does $500 more mean nothing to you?", "YTA - come on.  Maybe for you $500 isn't much, but for other it's the difference between making rent or getting evicted.  There were $300 seats. They just weren't good enough for you so you decided to not get them for your friends. It's fine if you don't want to sit in nosebleed seats, but don't let your friends loose out on their chance to see their favourite artist because you are a seat snob.", "> We negotiated and settled on a hard cap of $300.\n\n> I made the executive decision to get... tickets that came out to $800 a person\n\nlol what an asshole. Enjoy your new friendship group of 2 people", "YTA, i also was in charge of buying tickets and like you didnt really have a budget going in but my friend had a hard cap at $250. i waited about 5 hours and the choices were $99 nosebleeds or $800 floor, the obvious choice was the nosebleeds. I also had planned to get better seats if they were close to her budget and just cover any of the overage without telling her because thats what FRIENDS do. Honestly your TA for even making them raise their budget in the first place", "YTA because nosebleed seats were available.  They gave you are hard cap of $300, and seats WERE available for that. If you had said initially \"I want $1k tickets, so I'm going to buy those for myself and Friend, and then try to get $300 tickets for you,\" fine. You didn't have to be responsible for tickets for everyone.

That wasn\u2019t good enough for you, so you screwed your friends over.  \n\nAnd BTW, getting no tickets was a perfectly viable option.

Unless you planned to cover the overage for everyone who needed that $300 cap (which you clearly did not), you are a *giant* asshole.", "Of course YTA. In what world is it OK to blow past the agreed upon amount to spend for other members of a group, that you already know can't afford it. And by $500 each? You're so out of touch. And you even admit that there were seats available for the price that the group agreed to, but no no, you just had to go for the more expensive ones.

Your friends set a hard cap on how much they could spend.

You had a, group discussed, hard limit of $300. How could you think it would have been ok to spend that much?

That you just \"lost your mind in the moment\". I wish you the best, good luck.", "YTA. What do you think a \u201chard cap\u201d means? Your choices were to get 6 nosebleed tickets; get nosebleed tickets for the friends who had the cap and closer seat tickets for you and the friend who were willing to spend more; or buy all the closer seats and cover your friends\u2019 costs. It is NOT your choice to tell them they have to pay over double their spending limit.", "YTA. You know your friends struggle with money and there is no way they can afford that amount. I see only two options.. \n1) If money is no object to you and you don\u2019t mind taking a loss, as you say, cover the extra and save your friendship. \n2) Sell the tickets to others who have comparable incomes. Hope you hit it off and join their friend group.\n\nEdited for grammar.", "YTA. \n\nHow do you not understand this?\n\nJust because $800 isn't a lot of money *for you* doesn't mean it's not a lot of money. It's almost **triple** the limit your friends had.

At the very least you could have gotten them the tickets in their price range and met up after the show. \n\nYou basically poor shamed them and expected them to just be like \"Okay I'll pull 500 out of nowhere that I didn't have because you thought my cap was too low\".", "YTA. \nWow, you're mocking your friends' financial limitations. You are definitely not a friend to them. You should have not bought them tickets if they were beyond their affordable range, but you doubled the burden on them, and now you are planning to profit off their hurt. What a pathetic excuse for a person you are.", "YTA\n\n\"Hard cap\" means do not spend more than that.  Not only did you go over it, but by more than double, and people in school or low level jobs can't afford to pay $800 for one ticket.  If the tickets you got were like $350, that's one thing but you went WAAAY above what anyone agreed on.  Also, you lied because there were tickets for $300, you just wanted better tickets.\n\nEither agree to cover the difference for them or you can probably make some money scalping the tix but YTA.  If you scalp the expensive tickets you might make enough money to buy everyone shitty tickets, in which case you're NTA anymore,", "I've gone to over eight or so concerts within the past year. I completely understand the struggle of purchasing tickets on sites like Ticketmaster for popular performers. It's always more expensive than listed because ticket prices fluctuate based on demand (which is a pretty shit system that only benefits Ticketmaster) and scalpers are ALWAYS at the ready to buy up all the seats to resell for insane profits. You have to act fast (within seconds) or those seats you wanted are gone.  I also understand that it's always a compromise having to work within restrictive budgets when you want good seats. There are also tons of ridiculous fees that get added to the total price of the ticket that the casual concert-goer never considers.  It is a frustrating experience.  HOWEVER...\n\nWhere you messed up is that you agreed to a cap of $300. You disregarded that agreement for completely selfish reasons. When I plan to purchase concert tickets with my friends, I always confirm with them that they are willing to pay more for better seats.  If they are not, I either have to be ok with bad seats, be willing to cover the difference, or be willing to go on my own (and make sure my friends understand that).  Y  T  A.\n\nI do acknowledge that $300 is not a lot for high demand concert tickets because fees are usually around 15% of the ticket price.  That means you are really only working with $255 and you likely aren't going to get good seats for a highly anticipated concert like T. Swift. Depending on where you end up in the ticket purchase queue (as it's randomized), ticket prices fluctuate insanely.\n\nEDIT:  Saw that Op made an edit about her friends wanting lower bowl seats. Now ESH.  This is a combination of a couple of things:\n\n1. being a victim of Ticketmaster's fluctuating ticket price system (which is no one's fault but contributed to this mess),\n2. her friends having unrealistic expectations. The lack of concerts for 2+ years have contributed to the increase in ticket prices.  $255 was not going to get you lower bowl seats for a big name like Taylor, and\n3. her making an executive decision that was more than twice what her friends were willing to pay, even if they all wanted better seats.  I would've put my tickets on hold and confirmed with my friends first (knowing that I may lose my seats).", "NTA- it was a difficult decision you were in. You didn\u2019t have the option to buy yourself the 800 seats & get your friends the seats in their budget. We all have heard about the site crashing and how fast tickets were selling out. If your friends can\u2019t afford to pay 800 then at least you can recoup the money you paid. At least this way they have an option to go. Because The only other option was to only get you & the other friends tickets and not theirs since it was over their budget. And that is not your fault or theirs. Were they expecting you to get shitty seats in order to buy the tickets in their budget? I refuse to go to a concert it I can\u2019t get good seats.", "YTA.

How would you expect them to pay you back for the full $800? \u201cI made the executive decision\u201d you don\u2019t get to make financial decisions for other people, buy yourself the $800 ticket and respect their limit or cover the $500 if you decide to spend more money.", "YTA.

You basically have to make the purchase right away. I don't think anyone (even fans) anticipated how expensive and different this time around it would be to buy tickets. I think if you can, you should hold on to those tickets and after your friends cool down, they'll come around. They'll either buy them or forgive you and do their own thing. They still have a chance to buy tickets at the general sale too!

Because you made the offer, they did not try to purchase the tickets themselves (missing the opportunity to make that choice for themselves).\n\nBecause you unilaterally decided that you were going to buy tickets valued at $800 (a total almost 3x what they were able to pay), you took away the ability of your friends to be able to plan in their budget. \n\nWhat you should have done was buy the $300 tickets for those who NEEDED that price point (especially since you said they were available) and gotten the more expensive tickets for those that could afford and agreed to pay that that price. \n\nWhy you are the asshole is that you don\u2019t give a shit that your friends can\u2019t afford the tickets YOU decided to buy after AGREEING TO BUY THEM TICKETS.  That\u2019s why you\u2019re an asshole.
