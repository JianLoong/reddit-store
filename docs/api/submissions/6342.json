Her bf is a grown ass adult who I\u2019m sure can read and follow simple directions.", "Sounds like something he can communicate with her and not just use weaponized incompetence as a way to do that. \n\nOP, NTA. I\u2019m only partially joking when I say throw the whole man away in this instance\u2026 maybe just 1/4 of the man?", "It's not a new skill op says he has made the dish multiple times before.", "She is not an asshole for not teaching him", "Yes\nShe is \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe", "Lmfao. Motherfucker can\u2019t cook pasta and someone about to scoop him up and appreciate him for being a \u2018real man\u2019. \n\nPickme.", "JFC dude, that was quite the leap.  Are you projecting?", "If anyone wants to be impressed by my knowledge of how to boil pasta, I don\u2019t want it.", "NTA: he can't use his brain power to figure out how boxed spaghetti pasta is made??? it literally has a box with instructions.", "So he can say he did in future arguments.", "Disagree. In this case, the husband gets to pretend to do a favor while also dramatically inconveniencing her by deploying weaponized incompetence. It\u2019s the more advanced form.", ">OP's husband eagerly volunteered to make dinner. That is 100% incompatible\n\nHe eagerly volunteered to pretend to want to make dinner. Then he weaponized this (incompetence) by giving Op the mental load so she gets frustrated enough to take over.", "He didn't call her an idiot. Other part might be right but that isn't.", "No. His father was raised in the 1940s. Be realistic.", "This man did not humble himself. He\u2019s being incompetent because he doesn\u2019t want to put effort into learning or remembering.", ">til the water boils before putting in the pasta (h\n\nHe has made Pasta before multiple times just like OP Said. They likely just kept asking to get a response out of OP. Pasta is also a very simple dish to make, and all you need to know is on the back. His response to her response was cocky and unecasarry.", "Why must he ask her for directions when it's on the package?", "Thank you!", "I agree. He may very well be trying to be manipulative, but I honestly don't have enough info to think that's the case.\nI've felt really intimidated by cooking because I had a partner that was extremely critical of the food I made. It made me feel stupid. I'd been cooking and feeding myself and my son and friends/family for years. This person comes along and is in all honesty a great cook, but a total dick about it...that it killed it for me. I'm getting over it slowly..but I really felt like shit every time I made something and he wouldn't touch it or would hover over me and critique how I cut vegetables or boiled pasta. Literally, I was \"boiling pasta wrong\". Like wtf??", "[deleted]", "Youre the one putting that tone on him. If I tried to get help I needed from my partner and they were deliberately not helping me, I'd be annoyed too.\n\nBut go ahead, insult someone who you don't know based on minimal information.", "Yeah its kinda over the top.", "Exactly. This is weaponized incompetence, she\u2019s NTA.", "A lot of men don't even realize they're doing it; they learn it from their dads, and so they think it's normal.", "What\u2019s the point? You grow up and just can\u2019t ask questions? You learn everything the first time?", "Recipes don\u2019t always tell someone that doesn\u2019t know how to cook to actually cook. Someone may need literal step by step instructions.\n\nWhat may seem like common knowledge isn\u2019t always common.", "It\u2019s nothing to do with being a mother. There are things I teach my wife about what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s about helping someone who is asking for guidance. As stupid as the question may seem to YOURSELF.", "Why is answering a simple question \u201cmothering\u201d?", "And some people really are actually just incompetent.", "Really? You think that someone eagerly volunteering to perform a task is textbook weaponized incompetence?", "I, personally, like to cook, but I have a lot of friends that don\u2019t. They will cook occasionally when we have events that require everyone to cook some that that they\u2019re comfortable with. Everyone calls us and asks questions and we are understanding even when we have answered these questions before. I love these people but I am not in love with them. Look at context and make your assumptions but I believe that he is trying and is being hindered every time. I grew up in a family that couldn\u2019t cook and wanted to learn in order to have new foods. I can say from experience that being ridiculed and harassed while learning makes you anxious and it will make new information more difficult to remember.", "She also said \"he wanted to make\" so it sounds like his choice to cook.", "I will say, it\u2019s not impossible it was an honest mistake. Some people struggle with remembering directions. (While admittedly a teen at the time, I am of average intelligence and took *years* to remember how to make gravy. Gravy is incredibly simple to make and I was sort of designated gravy-maker as a teen). However, OP does say he had the pasta box with directions, so perhaps NTA for wanting him to use the instructions instead of asking questions", "He could have forgot? I'd forget that but I'm also ND so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I absent myself from the area when I know I\u2019m going to have to do all the brain work.  Suggest OP do the same.", "That's an ignorant thing to say, maybe his short term memory isn't that good?", "Okay, \"cold\" may be an exaggeration but it doesn't have to be boiling.  I've never had a problem starting it early.\n\nBut if \"he wanted to make\" dinner, as she said, then why would he pretend incompetence?", "And couldnt OP communicate that the questions are annoying?", "Why couldn't she communicate with her that its too exhausting when he makes dinner?\n\nPeople are often shy to express their feelings and needs, and this could be his way of getting her attention and doing something together, without seeming needy and deprived of attention.\n\nIt doesn't need to be annoying when someone asks you a lot of questions about something you are much more familiar with than them. It feels very rewarding when you share your skills with someone.", "Relationships are give and take....I love helping my partner. Especially when it's to learn a new skill that is something I am interested in.\n\nNot doing so and instead turning it into an argument sounds awful to me.", "but there was no expectation for him to do it in the first place. For how much reddit likes to throw around idioms, or other phrases, we are forgetting about Occam's razor. I find it far more likely he just doesnt know anything about cooking rather than he is playing 4d chess and did this to hold it over her head in 3 years.\n\nedit:I think I meant hanlons razor. oopsie", "Except that there's absolutely no indication that OP holds any expectation that her husband should cook.", "Literally no one who has made it to adulthood should be in over their head *boiling pasta*.", "I mean, it's boiling pasta", "I ask a lot of questions to my mom or my sister, even if there's a box instructions, or I need to watch videos. My brain simply doesn't retain the information even if I just read it, plus I get so anxious about ruining the dish that I need reassurance that I'm doing it right . I think we need more info about this tbh", "How to cook pasta is literally right on the box and the instructions are so easy any 10 yr old could follow.", "Well I guess I need more context because I\u2019m under the impression this man is choosing not to be resourceful and look it up or watch a video before asking a bunch of questions she has stated she\u2019s answered the last time he cooked.", "And some people just learn things differently than other people. Maybe he hears things & they sink in better than when he reads them. Some people need a visual guide. Nothing wrong with helping the poor guy out! He's trying to learn!", "It's not one question it's multiple. About something that he's made multiple times before.", "Because it was question after question about the m3al he says he wanted to make. He should take the initiative to find the answers. *especially * because the answer to the first question is on the package of the product. I know the trope is that men don't follow instructions,  but come on.", "I got a different impression entirely. She said she's explained / answered the exact same things multiple times. If you're married, there's only so many times you can tell your partner you take your coffee black with 1 sugar before you start to feel like they don't care", "Which makes it all the more frustrating. If he genuinely wants to make an effort, all he needs to do is read the recipe she sent him", "he wants the points for trying without actually trying so that later he can say he tried but \u201ci guess i\u2019m just bad at it.\u201d", "Maybe to you, but everyone is different. She sent him the recipe he wanted to make, he\u2019s already prepared these ingredients in part before, he asked to make dinner, she sat with him in the kitchen and answered questions by directing him to the information she has already provided. the husbands immediate response of \u201cI\u2019m just a f*cking idiot\u201d to OP reminding him he has the recipe is what made this NTA for me. While the onus of responsibility for health communication is on both of them, husband is TA here. He did not ask OP to help him cook, he asked OP if he could make dinner tonight, it would be his responsibility to carry out the plans or make alternate food arrangements if he fucks up the recipe. \n\nI personally cannot stand when my bf is in the kitchen with me as I\u2019m trying to cook - I want him to do 2 things: set the table & wash the dishes afterwards. My bf mostly hates cooking but will if he needs to when he\u2019s at his place, or on some nights when I\u2019m working super late and don\u2019t have time to cook. he does not ask me questions when he does so - he pulls up a video on YouTube and calls it a day. He doesn\u2019t always get it right but he\u2019s trying and that\u2019s what matters.", "Yes, sure, but does your partner feign incompetence repeatedly while demanding help ?", "Nowhere did I say op expects it nor is that a qualification for weaponized incompetence. Cooking normally falls under a household chore which the adults normally split in the house. Ergo it is expected he would be responsible for some chores.", "But he asked a very common question. Yeah it\u2019s pretty hard to screw up. But again not everything comes naturally to people.", "You sound frustrating", "But..if you genuinely didn\u2019t know how to cook, would you know the instructions are on the box? Some boxes it\u2019s not front and center or covered up.", "Depends, he could also be resourceful by asking her..\n\nBut yes, it\u2019s entirely possible he\u2019s being a dick just to be a dick. But being a male myself, when i first moved out there was simple shit i simply didn\u2019t know.", "So he can't ask his wife questions? Maybe he forgot last time, we don't know how often he cooks or what his memory is like.", "I don\u2019t know the ages of either, but let\u2019s pretend they are 20s. This could literally be his first time EVER cooking. Could be way wrong on ages but I don\u2019t have much info to go on.", "Multiple as in once a year? Or multiple as in twice a week. We are given zero context.", "I completely agree, but cooking is very different from that. There is a lot of nuance that cannot be learned after don\u2019t something a few times over the course of several months. This argument can is one that translates across many areas of a marriage and it doesn\u2019t matter what area. Be graceful and understanding or you are headed towards a divorce. It really is that simple. Unless you marry someone like yourself then there will be disagreements. But marrying someone like yourself leads to a very boring relationship. Asssuming these people are telling the complete truth leads to some very nonsensical ways of thinking.", "Perhaps but that's speculation not fact.", "No. And we have no proof OPs husband was either.\n\nIf you have done something 5 times in your life. With a break of months in between each occasion. Are you going to know exactly how to do it? Probably not.", "It absolutely is a requirement of weaponized incompetence. Weaponized incompetence is, by definition, done to get out of doing a task that is expected of you.", "Its.on.the.box.", "It does - but sometimes people will love do frustrating things and they need our help. Thats how relationships work.", "For pasta? He has never cooked pasta? 1. She sent him the recipe. 2. She told him the instructions were on the box. He got mad b/c he refused to read the instructions provided.\n\nMaking basic pasta isn't like making a souffle. The instructions are pretty darn easy to follow. The instructions are usually at a 5th grade reading level. \n\nThis is more than one way to perform weaponized incompetence. This is the version where the weaponizer wants the pats on the back for doing the task, but doesn't want to give you any ideas that you can ask them to do it again and definately never on their own or they might burn the house down.", "She says he has cooked pasta before", "I've been married for 33 years and my husband can boil pasta and scramble eggs and that is it. Lol. People need to take what they can get. This guy is starting off with pasta, maybe if he does well he will try something new!", "If it's once a year it's not multiple is it?", "Multiples as in many questions during the course of a single meal. We are given the context.", "So is that he was genuinely trying but incapable of remembering how to a meal that he\u2019s made before, despite having instructions and a recipe", "Except her saying she is tired of telling him and he keeps asking for the same help? Did you even read the post ?", "Chores are expected of him because he lives in the house. I\u2019m not sure where the disconnect is here\u2026", "He may simply not know, or isn\u2019t the sharpest crayon in the box. I\u2019m sure everyone has worked with that one person that asks the same question every single damn day. He could be that guy.", "He's not \"starting off\" because he has cooked it before.", "Not my point.\n\nRepetition of a task more often helps the ease of a task. Now this is getting more involved than pasta. Which I wholeheartedly agree a normal person should remember. \n\nBut not everyone\u2019s brain works the same.", "No, she said \u201chow to make it\u201d which could either validate your point or he was asking further steps (which is how I took it)", "So is there some magical number of questions one is allowed to ask?", "Not quite.  OP said \"he wanted to make\" which implies desire.  Perhaps it was only \"he wanted to make *this dish* after I forced him to cook dinner\" but that would also be speculation.  Perhaps OP will clarify the situation.", "I literally just explained my reasoning about those comments...", "Not buying it one bit. And that employee who asks the same question over and over when there isnclear documentation provided is being lazy and needs to be told to read the documentation before asking questions.", "But he had multiple resources on hand. She has a right to be frustrated.", "You're ridiculous. She's allowed to be frustrated about being asked the same questions time and time again. No obviously their is no magical number but in that case is she obligated to answer?", "OP is saying that if he's offering to make a meal, he should figure it out.", "Yeah, idk, that\u2019s a lot of speculation", "Her exasperation is indicative of this. It\u2019s exhausting to be the expected person to not only do this but teach it", "That\u2019s fine we don\u2019t have to agree.", "Ok. But we only have her exasperation to go on. She doesn't state anything about what your are arguing.", "Yes she did. She said it\u2019s happened multiple times and he knows this one. He\u2019s asking of pasta should be cooked once the water comes to boil ffs"]}
