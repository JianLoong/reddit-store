It's a flawed system because it's extremely inconvenient and sometimes downright dangerous to wait at an open gate that long, especially since a \\*lot\\* of storage buildings have pretty short driveways that can only fit 1.5-3 cars before you hit the gate unless you don't mind parking in oncoming traffic to avoid piggybacking. I've personally had a few units where staff told me I didn't have to wait to pull in after another car either because the gate timer was so long or because the driveway was so short that it was too dangerous to sit halfway in a lane- and, yes, these were places that formally had a no piggybacking rule but practice knew that it wasn't always practical.\n\n  \n\n\nOP, the way you decided to confront that couple was creepy and aggressive. You were already parked yet decided to pull out, follow them all the way around the building, and park right on top of them to scold them. When they're rightfully freaked out and go slightly overboard on telling you off (because they likely felt deeply unsafe due to your behavior- btw who are you to demand an apology??) you start taking pictures of them, which does nothing to ease their thoughts that you may be some dangerous creep. Then to make matters worse you stake them out in your car like a stalker and follow them out when they're done.\n\n  \n\n\nHow could they know you weren't some aggressive vigilante? How did they know that \\*you\\* weren't the thief? How could they know you weren't a wannabe robber who put an airtag on their car and staked them out with the intent of following them home or breaking into their storage unit? There's a reason these places have staff and there's also a reason you don't work there. You really shouldn't do anything like this again.", "Next time pull through and stop woth just enough space for the gate to close behind you.", "They were there for stepping stuff. 100%. Report them.", "NTA. They sus. Who reacts like that? Sus people.", "NTA. Let management know and send them the pictures. I and my hubby have done this, if something happened and you were the last one into the storage units...guess who gets to deal with the headache and trying to prove it wasn't you?", "NTA and I\u2019d report what happened and give the pictures to the police\u2026 just in case", "I would have called the police", "NTA but they sure are defensive", "NTA, but you put yourself in a very dangerous situation.  Whether they were thieves or legit had a storage space of their own, they could have hurt you. \n\nIf something like that happens again, just get a pic of the vehicle or the license plate, but only if it doesn't endanger you.", "NTA\n\nAt our storage facility, we are instructed to keep our car at the gate until it closes behind us. Doing that would prevent anyone from piggy backing on your code.", "NTA. As you said, there is no record of their entry. In the future, don't pull all the way forward until the gats close on your entering.", "NTA. As someone who\u2019s storage unit was torn apart and most of my belongings stolen when I was a young adult, if you see something, say something. Maybe not to the person doing it, but definitely to someone in charge.", "NTA-definitely report them to the office and the police. People who do this are practiced and don\u2019t just hit one storage place. If they were up to no good then the police will have them on camera but maybe not identified yet. You may have that key.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a property manager at a storage facility, and like you said that\u2019s against the rules. At my property if I see someone do that, they get a warning and if they spoke to me like that I just terminate their lease. \nI would say if you have that issue again, just let the manager know so you aren\u2019t potentially putting yourself in harms way. I would also say to just go tell the manager what happened anyways so they can review the footage if they have it and decide what they want to do about that tenant. My worry with someone following you in and getting that upset about being confronted is that they\u2019re either there to break into someone else\u2019s unit or they\u2019re locked out of the gate for nonpayment.", "NTA  You were thinking on your feet.  Report them to management so that if there are break-ins you can give the police the info.", "NTA.\n\nThey should be reported to the storage facility manager.", "Definitely NTA. They're just being AH because you outed them for bad behavior. They're children. Easy to laugh off.", "Their reactions say it all...sketchy as hell.", "NTA and I feel bad for her husband for having to put up with her psychotic behavior", "NTA - but a prime example of why I mind my own damn business. If I felt obligated to protecting the storage facility, I would have gotten the photos as inconspicuously as possible and notified the property manager without saying a single word to them. Do not engage with \u201csketchy\u201d people, ever. \n\nThe stuff in those storage units isn\u2019t worth the risk of them taking your life.", "YTA. Sorry, if you genuinely thought they could be stealing, why would you confront them on your own? You were confrontational bc you didn\u2019t like that he answered with a simple \u201cok\u201d rather than a thank you. Maybe they just went in bc it was easier.", "Nta report them I think you may have found shady people", "I\u2019d say both guys acted reasonably. If someone is acting suspicious, it\u2019s not an AH move to ask them what\u2019s up. At the same time, just ignoring someone you don\u2019t want to engage with isn\u2019t really a problem either. Life isn\u2019t about appeasing everyone all of the time.\n\nThe only real AH here is the person who flipped out. People should be able to have a disagreement without flipping out.", "Honestly I really think YTA. I\u2019m not saying that your logic was wrong just that you handled the whole entire situation wrong. \n\nIf there was someone behind you when you put in your code why didn\u2019t you block the way once through the gate so they couldn\u2019t piggyback on your code? If they weren\u2019t right behind you when you got there what were they supposed to do? Wait for the gate to close and then put in their own code to get in? \n\nIf someone came up to me after this my response would have been the same okay. Then I\u2019d wait for you to leave so I could do whatever I needed in my storage unit. The woman shouldn\u2019t have cursed you out but really you didn\u2019t need to confront anyone you could have taken a picture of their plates and then reported them when the office opened. Honestly most facilities have cameras that catch this behavior anyways.", "Why would you even care? You sound like a busy body mind your own business", "Your TA for referring to her as \"his woman\".\n\nNext time save yourself some trouble and just report the number plate to management.", "For the storage place I use if you don't enter your own code the alarm is still active on your unit. The code turns off the alarm for your unit. So they would not be able to open the unit without the alarm going off.", "Ya I am shocked at their behaviour too. They are totally looking like a trashy reality show contestants .", "I can think of a few \"do you even know who I am\" types who don't feel that the rules really apply to them.  They understand that you aren't supposed to piggyback but they know they aren't a criminal and they're in a hurry so back the fuck off.", "Because they came in on my code. \nIf they break into a unit, my code will come up. That\u2019s why I care. They made it my business.", "Except she\u2019s on record entering and they aren\u2019t.", "Why would anyone wait for the gate to close just to put in their code. What a waste of time! I always go in if the gate is open someplace and I need to get in. And if someone confronted me about it I'd tell them to fuck off and mind their own business. It's not my job to playcate paranoid people.", "Sorry, let me be clearer. \n\nYou don\u2019t confront them. Especially since it\u2019s likely they are up to no good. \n\nYou take pictures of their license plate and car and them if you can. Then you email the pictures to the storage company with notes about the time and date and how they piggy backed in. So if something does happen the police can go after then, and if they are renters, the company can go after them.", "You have anger management issues", "Our storage area has a working camera on the gate. I think they should all do that.", "Slow gates was how it happened with the storage facility we used. It took a minute to recognize we were clear and start closing. The closing process wasn't that slow, but the recognition and it staying open did take a bit.", "The \"ancedotal evidence\" is showing that more.often than not facilities with gates take a minute or two to completely close.", "Storage places usually require a code be entered to exit the premises. Is that not the case here? Otherwise, how did they get out?", "ESH, I get your side of things, thefts and crimes can really make someone cautious and protective, because who knows you could be next and you want to make sure your stuff is safe. I get it. However, I also understand their side of things. Its pretty common place for someone to drive through when they see the gate open, I acknowledge that its against the rules of wherever the gate is located but it really is just one of those things where the average person isn't going to stop and wait for the gate to close just so they can use their own code to open it again.\n\n If the woman did just jump to spewing profanities with no real build up as to why then she's obviously in the wrong but I can also see from her perspective some random person showing up and disturbing them while they are doing their business and trying to establish some moral high ground. When you said your going to start taking pictures thats also something further escalated this lady because now this random stranger who drove around the complex just to tell them they were wrong about something when they were minding their own business is now about to start violating their privacy. Honestly them driving off after they were done and giving you the finger is pretty expected.", "NTA, but not safe. Also, next time, just pull slightly in and wait in front of the gate until it closes, that way no one can piggyback.", "I feel like this should be animated by Mike Judge.", "NTA I only pull in enough for my car to get through then let gate shut and them put their code in. Same reason, people jumping in behind me", "NTA. They were being sketchy and their reaction proves that.", "NTA, they were in the wrong.  Sorry that happened to you.  I\u2019d report the incident to the site manager and give them any pictures that turned out well.", "nah u doin us a service nta", "NTA. A friend of mine once let her colleague use her password at the bank she worked at. The woman stole a lot of money from the bank and because she used my friend's ID to do it, my friend also lost her job. Talking to them and taking photos was the right thing to do.", "In case you are in this situation again, a common rule for entering secured facilities is to pull through the gate and then immediately stop abc block the roadway until the gate closes behind you. This allows only one vehicle to pass per gate opening and no one can move by your vehicle until it closes. \n\nYour call if you want to die on that hill but that\u2019s how military bases, airports, etc. prevent piggy backing.", "NTA. Not safe though. Is there a security number you can take with you next time? Or stop just the other side of the gate until it closes next time.", "NTA. Former storage manger here. Your storage facility should have alarms on the units and cameras everywhere. If they don\u2019t, find a new place. It sounds like you scared them off and they were gonna cut some locks. Good job but be careful. I wonder if they were waiting for someone to piggy back on. Another thing you can do is pull in and sit with your car in front of the gate until it closes, that will make them enter a code.", "They are either entitled as fuck or if you are a white person and they are POC and assumed you might be a racist person.\n\nEither way, if it happened as you said it and for the reason you said it, NTA", "If I had a code, that certainly wouldn\u2019t have been my reaction to being called out. Just saying.\n\nNTA", "Basing this completely on your actions alone and not the responses of the couple you confronted - YTA. Mind your business. Some people are in a hurry and don't want to sit there waiting for the gate to close so they can input their number then wait for the gate to open again. Rolling in after someone else isn't inherently suspicious. If you really have a concern, just take a pic of their license plate and send an email to staff so they can follow up if they choose. \n\nHonestly, if someone approached me the way you approached them, I'd have given the same first response \"ok\" and expected to continue on with my day. If you had bothered me further I'd probably have told you to fuck off because I'm not obligated to be polite to busybodies. \n\nThe reaction of the woman of this couple was completely unhinged, however. You didn't deserve that level of vitriol.", "NTA but that was unbelievably dangerous and fucking stupid on your part. They could have seriously hurt you.", "Agree. Worked in retail for a long time. The people who were actually up to something bad would always cause a giant scene and try their hardest to villainize us for calling attention to their behavior ie catching them in the act", "Yeah. I have a storage unit and have \u201cpiggy backed\u201d before\u2026 and people have done the same to me. I never really thought it was a deal, until this post. Whenever I visit my storage, it\u2019s usually to grab something quickly. I would be creeped out too if some weird lady followed me to tell me about the storage facilities policies. Idk, it\u2019s just weird to me, and to demand an apology? Most facilities have security and there are staff that work there to file a complaint if there is an issue. She assumed the role of security guard and for what? I\u2019d be bugged.", "Exactly.  I don\u2019t think people understand that they would have had to wait for the gate to close again to enter their code.\n\nI piggy back into the work parking lot every time I can because why would I wait for it to close and open again?  It has nothing to do with being sneaky.\n\nThe OP acted in an accusatory manner over something that most people do out of convenience.  Simply notifying the staff would have been enough.\n\nRegarding the reaction of the woman, when you accuse someone of stealing or strongly imply it, that is actually serious for a lot of people.  You don\u2019t know what she or they have experienced in life and a likely false accusation could have significant consequences for them.\n\nAlso, OP, storage units are relatively cheap.  Have you considered that it would be easy for someone to just rent their own small unit and use it for access to steal from others?  Have you considered that the staff themselves could be the thieves?  I\u2019m not practiced in the art of burglary, but somehow I doubt thieves are waiting idly at the gate to very noticeably piggy back on someone else\u2019s gate code for all the cameras and customers like yourself to see.\n\nI think your behavior is more hyper vigilant than responsible.", "The lady was wrong for flipping out, but the OP\u2019s behavior was akin to an accusation, and being accused of a crime is serious for a lot of people, especially if they have a checkered background.  The behavior OP believes was just vigilance could lead to very negative consequences for those people.\n\nThe OP didn\u2019t need to do anything more than mention it to the staff; and if still dissatisfied with the level of security there, move to a more secure storage facility.", "They didn\u2019t owe the OP an apology.\n\nThe man said OK, the woman had a temper.  OP was foolish for assuming that they could play security guard without having any authority to do so.  Not knowing how people will react based on their personality and life experiences is one of the reasons you don\u2019t confront people like this.", "You wait for the gate to close. That\u2019s the policy. They came in on my code. So, I\u2019m not a \u201cbusy body\u201d \nYour comment is ironic, because it\u2019s long, and if anyone is a busy body, it\u2019s you.", "Came to say the same thing, that was extremely dangerous and OP is very lucky they were just the regular variety of crazy and not the bang bang stick kind.", "Quietly and discreetly take a license pic maybe. Otherwise go straight to the lot management and tell them someone piggybacked your code and a description of the car. Then management can deal with it.", "When I had a stage unit, mine was the same.

Just curious. That sounds cool as shit.", "Bit concerned this weird piggybacking and intimidation incident just coincidentally happened when there were no staff around", "The two companies Ive used for storage had it set up that if you didnt out your code to get in, it wouldnt work to let you out.

Using that to make a false accusation that could result in significant consequences is why some people will react angrily.", "The places I\u2019ve used don\u2019t do that, but you have to use your code to activate the gate upon leaving as well, and if you got in without using your code it won\u2019t open the gate because it has no record of you entering in the first place.", "I very much agree. Thats why Im a firm believer in people just minding their own business and if they have any concerns bringing it up to the staff (like you said) and not trying to solve anything themselves.
