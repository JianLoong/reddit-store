I've been living in London for 7 years and completely hate it here. All this time I have spent around 40-50% of my total income on rent. For the past 3 years I worked hard to increase my salary and get a remote job, and now earn circa 40-42k. I come from nothing and don't even have a degree so this is a big for me.\n\n\nMy partner recently changed jobs and now earns almost double what I earn. When we moved to our current place, which I did as a sacrifice for her because she really wanted to stay in London for one more year. I told her that this is the last year that I will spend in London, because I REALLY hate this city. I am not a city person at all, or at least not a big city person. But I stayed here because of her job commitments. \n\nI don't even leave the house because of how much I hate it, and for a long time I was severely depressed and even gained 30KG because of how much I hate it here. \n\nWe just had a discussion about moving to a nice 3 bedroom house about 1hr and 25 minutes from my partner's place of work. She only goes to the office twice a week and the rest is remote. The rent for this place is \u00a31050 per month, vs our current place which is about \u00a32100 in a very shitty area. The new place has 3 bedroom, 2 living rooms, and a garden and is a house. \n\nHowever she completely refuses to move outside London, citing that the 1 and a half hour commute(1 train) two days a week is not worth it and around 300\u00a3 a month on commuting costs is not worth it. \n\nSo as a counter offer, because she is so insistent on staying in London, even though I hate it here, I am willing to sacrifice for another year or so. I asked her to pay a bit more rent instead of paying 50/50 to make it a little more bearable and allow me to save more instead of living paycheck to paycheck. She's\u00a0 refusing this and made it to be all about the money now that she's doubled her salary. \n\nAm I unreasonable to think she should pay a little more now that she has the means to? Aren't partners supposed to help each other if one is in a much better financial situation? I am not asking for much more, at most 10-15% more to help offset some of my costs. \n\nThe job she just got is because I pushed her to get it. I did her CV and practiced interview questions with her. I even paid for all our living expenses for almost 2 months whilst she was waiting for the new job. I didn't ask for any money back except for rent. She also owes me about 7000\u00a3 from when my side business did well. I forgave this loan because at the time she was broke. She's making it about money which is unfair. \n\nWhy is she not playing the same game and support me unconditionally as I have in the past. \n\nAITA for asking her to pay more if she is not willing to move somewhere cheaper?", "created_utc": 1684882800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q3s7w/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_who_insists_to_live/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you stay with her, you'll end up in London for the rest of your life; if you want out of London, it will never be with her.", "Info:  What are you really getting out of this relationship?  Relationships are not about 1 persons wants or desires.  I would think there could be a compromise as far as living arrangements. Not everyone is a city person just as not everyone is not a rural person.

Don't lose yourself for someone else who refused to take your wants, dreams and needs into consideration.", "NAH\n\nLook, the rent is not the major issue here. The major issue is that you want completely different lifestyles.

If she's making twice what you do, she shouldn't be paying a little more. It should be a 67% / 33% split.\n\nRent and utilities should be split proportionally to income.\n\nThat said, I agree with others that she's stringing you along. She will never agree to a move that results in her having a long commute. And I don't blame her. Spending more than an hour commuting is hellish. Just like you can't stand living in London, I would expect her to be unable to stand that long of a commute twice a week.\n\nYou should see if there's anything in between those two extremes that would work for both of you.\n\nAnd the rent should be split the same way even if you move someplace less expensive.", "NTA:  But why are you with someone who cares so little about you.  You tell her you're unhappy in the city, you never go out and gained weight due to being an in area you don't like.  Her response is basically so what. \n\nThan after you covered her rent, forgave a loan she now won't help you when you're struggling.  She doesn't sound like a good partner", "NAH. It really sounds like you guys just have different priorities in life my dude", "NTA because I do think splitting rent proportionally is fair, but that doesn't seem to be the actual issue here. No matter where you live, one of you is going to be unhappy which is a compatibility issue.   \n\nYou keep sacrificing for 'one more year' but unless you've left out her agreeing that she WILL move in one year, it sounds like you're just going to keep pushing it out and you will grow to resent her.

So she needs to be paying 70% of the rent and you 30%.  \n\nIf she is not willing to compromise on this and its effecting your mental health then you need to give this a very serious thought before staying another year.

Because \"I want to move 1h25min away from London\" or \"Ok one more year but you pay more\" isn't a real compromise since she never agreed in the first place. It's something good for you, not for her.\n\nMaybe you can find a new place near London to both be happy? She'll still be close to the city and you'll be away from it - and boom, everyone is happy now?\n\nNAH btw.
