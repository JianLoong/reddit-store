I mean this is not a grocery bag or trash bag, right?  \n\nIts lasted 20 years.  it sounds like an awesome bag.   Its not like he's insisting on wearing it,  or running down busy streets waving it around and yelling \"see my bag???? see how awesome????\".   Its a freaking bag.  \n\nYour concern is its dirty?   Fair enough,  he should clean it.  Some good ol soap and water.   Wrinkled?  who gives a shit?  he's using it to store stuff.   \n\nWhat do you have against this bag?  You should focus on other things.   \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou made a decision, that doesn't mean you get to force it on him.

It is a bag that can be folded up and put away out of signt.  \nDon't make an issue where there is none. That kind of controlling behavior would be worrisome to me if I were him. If it continues to obsess you, try therapy, there might be issues for you to deal with.\n\nYTA", "Idk man, an indestructible bag seems pretty necessary.\n\nThis seems like a non issue.

It's his binky!  Let him have it.", "He\u2019s had it since he was six? The \u201cfucking bag\u201d isn\u2019t that big of a deal. Why don\u2019t you just let him keep it?

Stop trying to control people. YTA.", "YTA - this def gives me the \u201cI watched a tiktok about organizing\u201d vibes.", "Maybe he want to keep it for sentimental value? If he\u2019s used it for 20 years he\u2019s definitely attached to it. I would leave it be and let him keep it tbh, there\u2019s no harm done and it\u2019s useful", "YTA but this is silly. It\u2019s not hurting anyone. Find a drawer for it and leave it alone.", "YTA. It's just a bag. How would you like it if he started going through your stuff and deciding what he wanted to get rid of!?", "A plastic bag that survived 20 years, through childhood and everything? Damn, I'd keep it. Also, just to point out,, it wasn't \"unnecessary\" as it sounds like is was being actively used. You just didn't like it. YTA", "YTA. That plastic bag is his best friend and you killed it.", "Yeah YTA. He likes that bag and it\u2019s not harming you in any way.

This seems like a useless argument.", "They literally don\u2019t make them like they used to!", "Of course YTA; it's a plastic bag, why do you care?", "YTA.

Leave his bag alone dude.", "That\u2019s his baby you can\u2019t take that from him lmao", "YTA. \n\nAlso where can I get this kind of bag, please?", "YTA: I don\u2019t think him keeping the bag is the issue here but why you have got so annoyed about it. YOU decided to start this year a fresh! Great, good for you. He\u2019s had that bag longer than your relationship, the bag was there first and at this rate after.

I\u2019d consider it endearing.", "if you can\u2019t live with a bag folded up in a closet or stored somewhere in your home, maybe there are more issues than the bag. \n\np.s. the bag has been in his life longer than you. \n\nlet him have his damn bag.", "I find it hard to believe that he's been using it since he was 6.

I can't imagine fighting about this.\n\nESH", "NTA- There are deeper issues that are going to surface.", "It really depends on the state of the bag. If it's a total eyesore, being visibly beaten to hell, yeah, throw it out. He can grow up, if that's the case. If it's only a bit dirty and wrinkly, it isn't a big deal. Just find an alternative use for it. Maybe for something outdoors or in a garage if you have one. If the two of you did not mutually agree to your newfound idea of starting fresh, then let him keep the bag. Consider it a small sacrifice in comparison to whatever else you're getting rid of that may be his. If you're going to end up buying something else to replace it, there's also no point in getting rid of it as long as it's usable elsewhere.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why does it bother you so much? I'm sure there are things of yours that he thinks you don't need or  think are an eye sore. This is petty to have such a visceral reaction over a bag. I feel like there's more to it than it's just an eye sore. Does he bring it out with him everywhere like a security blanket and that embarrasses you? If that's the case maybe buy him a nicer tote bag that's more pleasant to look at for your sake. \n\nOr is he a hoarder and the bag has become a crutch for him to not be able to part with useless things?", "YTA   \nHe clearly has a deep emotional attachment to this bag.   \nFold it lovingly, and store it under his jocks in the drawer.
