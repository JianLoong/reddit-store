If so could it be worthwhile asking them if they'd be willing to allow your child/children the opportunity to do this for a while and see if they can stick at that?

It's OP who's life will be majorly affected of no one else takes care of the dog?

And they barely looked at it. They don't even cuddle it, let alone actually take care of it.\n\nThis isnt about love, OP will love the dog and doesnt care if his kids or partner love the dog more, clearly?? This *is* about responsibility, and the fact OP will be stuck taking care of this dog on his own that he, more than likely, doesnt have time for. Especially because his partner is just finishing a degree, and he has children that cant even clean up after themseleves (which OP still also needs to clean up after). And if this dog has to be rehomed or, if it cant be, and is subsequently brought to a shelter (which happens all the time in this sort of situation)? Thats the real living being thats suffering in this scenario.\n\nThis is coming from someone who had dogs as a child and growing up because me and my sibling actually proved we could take care of them at\n 8yo and 10yo, and consistently did so, BEFORE we actually got the pup (which no one but OP has done so far).
