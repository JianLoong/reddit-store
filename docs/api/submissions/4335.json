My partner has specifically told me that his sister said to him that she will never like anyone he is with. There's family issues and that means she can't/won't approve of any other woman being in his life. He's told me this specifically. He said she wants him to be her person basically, so me being in the picture, or any other woman that she doesn't choose, is an issue for her. He also said he doesn't think she and I will ever be friends, regardless of how much I try to forge a good relationship with her. It just won't happen. \n\nMy partner and I are going through a rough patch. Not long ago we had an argument. Before it was resolved he left to go to his sister's house. He needed space and that's fine. I also needed space. I spent the good part of 2 weeks at a friend's house while we worked through it.\n\nWhen we reconnected he made it very obvious that on the night he went to her house, in the heat of the moment, he and his sister talked about me and she had nothing nice to say. She brought up all my weaknesses (while trying to forge a good relationship, she and I had gotten to the point where we could have some deeper conversations together, I told her about the mental health issues I'd had in the past, thinking that letting her know my vulnerabilities while she was expressing her own might help us form a connection). \n\nHe admitted that by having this conversation with her in the heat of the moment, he had put a further riff between his sister and I, and basically eliminated all the progress I had tried to make with her. It really upset me. I told him he needs to have a serious talk with his sister given he has now given her ammunition to justify her hate for me. \n\nHe wanted me to go to her house the next day to pick something up for him. I said no. I said I didn't feel comfortable going to her house given the circumstances. I'm fine with him talking to his sister about our issues, but not in the heat of the moment where emotions are high and regrettable things are said.\n\nHe said I'm TA because I should just suck it up, she's never going to like me, but that doesn't mean I should stop trying. My friend said I'm not TA because I'm allowed to feel uncomfortable and say no, particularly given this situation was to do my partner a favour.", "created_utc": 1670601119, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh0r3l/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_around_to_my_future/", "score": 313, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her behaviour shouldn't be entertained, rather addressed with professional help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, as partners you protect each other. He is choosing not to stand with you here, instead expecting you to suffer your SIL frankly abusive behaviour. He is failing as a partner.", "NTA\n\n> she's never going to like me anyway\n\nWell, then you\u2019re under no obligation to have to deal with her, and *he* needs to suck it up.  Although frankly, the fact he\u2019s not only not willing to put his foot down that her attitude is *deeply* unhealthy and he will not be indulging it, but actively *letting* her bash you despite *knowing* she\u2019s delighted by the opportunity whether it\u2019s justified or not, and then blaming the lack of progress on *you* should have you seriously asking whether this relationship is really worth salvaging.", "NTA. So every woman he\u2019s ever with just has to suck it up instead of him being a fucking grown up and laying down some boundaries with his borderline incestuous sister? Like seriously, that\u2019s not even a judgement, that is an observation of events. His sister is a creep.", "NTA you really need to reconsider this relationship. If she is going to always be a big part of his life and if he\u2019s going to fuel the fire when things get rocky for you, I can\u2019t imagine this going well for you. Both their logic is fucked and their relationship sounds hella enmeshed", "NTA, boyfriend and sister are definitely TAs. She's oddly possessive over her brother and he's oddly allowing it. That entire relationship is suspect and I wouldn't be surprised if it showed up with a Brazzers tag. He SHOULD be putting his sister in her place and not allowing her to disrespect you and his relationship with you just because she feels like she can. His lack of spine in that regard is a serious problem and if he chooses to allow her to cause rifts between you both continuously your relationship is predictably going to be painful until it ends.", "Absolutely nta...\n\nAnd he's the asshole for not having the testicular fortitude to stand up to his sister. Her behavior should not be ok to him if yours isn't ok to him.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nTheir relationship sounds far too entwinned and dependent on each other. She is very controlling of his life and he let's her. From this side, it sounds ridiculous to hate any woman he'd be with for no reason, other than some fucked up thing in the past she's never worked through.\r  \n\r  \nI'd seriously reconsider this relationship with him. He will never put you ahead of his sister, ever. Even if you get married and have kids, she will always be there, pulling the strings as his puppet master.", "NTA. You realize he did it on purpose, don't you? He enjoys the attention of two women fighting over him. He doesn't want you to get along, he craves the drama. He deliberately set you up in an adversarial relationship with her and wants to keep the show going. Super creepy.", "NTA he keeps putting you in an awkward position of having to be the nice and good one who has to suck it up. What about asking/telling his sister to do the same?\n\nWhy are you the one who has to make the sacrifice?", "NTA. Go NC with her, you and your partner have some serious shit to work out regarding her", "NTA\n\nSeems like a momma\u2019s boy but with his sister instead. Good luck. \n\nAngry or not, bitching about you to anyone else is unacceptable. Use the energy to work on things, not to make them worse and alienate additional people.", "NTA. Your BF made a classic relationship rookie mistake; while it's understandable he would go to his sister as someone to whom he's closest, to discuss relationship issues, he should have known and done better by you and gone to someone else less biased. You guys had an argument, you didn't break up which is for what he should reserve his venting about you to her. \n\nNow that the damage is done, HE has a responsibility to you and his sister by playing peacemaker and the sooner, the better.  She needs to understand he loves you and you're his partner, even if she doesn't like you, she still needs to respect you.  (And any lowball snark she feels compelled to throw your way, is not allowed in his or your presence.)\n\nEdit:  don't share private details with her anymore, or with anyone until they are close friends who love you.

I'm not going to accept being mistreated indefinitely, that's not how this works. You are enabling a bully and telling me to take it and keep taking. That's not love, that's abuse and I'm not here for that.", "NTA - She's never going to like you, but YOU should keep trying? Nope. Hard no. Relationships require two people to try. If he doesn't expect her to try, then he cannot ask you to try. Simple as that.", "**NTA**\n\n>He said I'm TA because I should just suck it up, she's never going to like me, but that doesn't mean I should stop trying. \n\nActually, that absolutely means that you should stop trying, and he's a massive AH for suggesting otherwise. You are not required to continue to expend emotional energy and effort on someone who has made it clear that they have no intention of ever liking you or even being kind or neutral to you. He is literally asking you to self-flagellate, to harm yourself by putting yourself through stress and discomfort for the sake of begging his sister to like you when she has openly stated that that won't happen. He's asking you to let her continuously mistreat you for no reason at all, when you can (and want to) just remove yourself from her presence entirely. \n\nYou are NTA, but I would very much question staying with a man who says, \"I don't understand why you won't persist in smashing your head against this wall because I ask you to. I know that it hurts, and that it's not going to stop being a concrete wall, but that's no reason to stop bashing your head against it.\" It's irrational, but more importantly, it doesn't take YOUR well-being into account at all. Your partner does not care about how any of this affects you.", "NTA\n\nThe problem is bigger than her not ever going to like someone in his life, it\u2019s that he turns to her when his relationship has troubles. This means he\u2019s never going to prioritize you.\n\nDo not have children with this man. He and his sister will raise them and place you on the outside.", "&#x200B;\n\n* It has been made clear to you that there is nothing you can do to change SILs attitude towards you. \n* SIL slags you off and what you say has been used against you. It is reasonable that you feel uncomfortable. \n* You recognise that you can't change her attitude / behaviour. \n* You can however control how you manage it, and keeping your distance is a perfectly acceptable way of managing bad attitude, bitching etc\n* You are not escalating the situation you are just doing what is your means to protect yourself from someone who makes you uncomfortable.\n\nTherefore NTA", "Get Out.

But move on from this loser who is willing to share your vulnerabilities without your consent.", "you realize that he\u2019s basically allowing his sister to be on the side further eroding y\u2019alls relationship, right? there\u2019s a reason why people would say to not talk to your family or friends about problems in a relationship/marriage bc you can\u2019t take back what you said and the people you told will have a bad impression of your partner that will be almost impossible to shake off. your husband is basically self sabotaging your marriage by complaining to his sister (who he knows hates you with the fiery passion of a thousand suns).", "This is a form of abuse !", "He wants you to keep taking the heat, since it keeps it off him.

You did say there was trauma so idk what that is but if he's in a serious relationship with you then he should be prioritizeing you. Its just going to get worse from here, what will happen when both you and his sister need something at once? There's a good chance that he will choose his sister. Think honestly and seriously about this, does he have the traits of someone who you believe will defend you and be loyal to you? Would he defend you against his sister? Seems like he wouldn't.\n\n\nSecond, he is complicit in the mistreatment of you. He simply allows his sister to be rude and nasty, and instead of correcting her he just tells you to get over it.
