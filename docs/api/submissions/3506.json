My grandma had a small neighborhood store. One of my distant uncles wanted to leave some boxes for \u201ctemporary\u201d storage because he needed to run \u201cerrands\u201d, and would not let my grandma open them. My grandma refused, because she had a bad feeling about the whole thing. My grandpa insisted on wanting to help my uncle though, but my grandma put her foot down.\n\nGood thing she did, because there were drugs hidden in the boxes and my distant uncle wanted to stash the boxes because the cops were on his tail. He got caught, and we would have been implicated if we had the boxes on hand. Our police force are not known for being real objective, and the courts move at a snail\u2019s pace. If you\u2019re unlucky you could spend a decade in prison before having your case dismissed.\n\nSo put your foot down OP. There is a reason why your cousin wants to stay for a few weeks, and you might not want to be near the reason why. He can get an AirBNB.\n\nNTA, and please be safe.\n\nEdits because I did not sentence good.", "not sure what you do for work but have you thought of picking up and moving to a different town?", "NTA.

Since your dad can't seem to honor your concern about having him live there and probably never will . . . I would move away. Your dad and your cousin can live together without you. You don't want dangerous people being drawn to your home . . .", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to say no.

Is your father crazy or too weak to stand up to this criminal cousin?  Can you change the locks before they get there, and then go out and talk to just your father?  Father can pay for a hotel room for cousin, but it's not your responsibility.  What if the cousin is busted by the police while staying at your house?

So, your cousin is a criminal and your dad wants to bring him to stay with you at your apartment.  Why would your dad do that?  What's in it for him?  Is your cousin dangerous?  I don't want to say anything that could put you in danger but considering the violence that the cartels are known for - my only suggestion is to not be there when your dad shows up with your cousin.  Find other family members to stay with, or a girlfriend or another friend - just don't be there.\n\nI think you probably realize that you probably need to find another place to live - without your dad.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA but I suggest you read through your lease and determine if a long-term guest is allowed.

You are one, btw. He\u2019s wanted and you\u2019re letting him hide in your place. Guilty by association. Don\u2019t risk it, OP. \n\n\n\nNow, something else. Your dad saying \u201ca few weeks\u201d means actually months. You and I know that, because Mexico is just like that, with their \u201chelping faaaaaaamily\u201d extreme ideology. No. Help yourself, find a friend or someone who might let you stay at their place for a while and get out. \n\n\n\nI agree that if you go to the authorities you\u2019d be wanted in that town. Cartels don\u2019t forgive. But Mexico is big and you can always find a prettier place than your dad\u2019s hometown to visit.
