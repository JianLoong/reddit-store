They will tell you no. Why? Bc at his home, they weren\u2019t allowed to have a life. They were allowed friends or to participate in activities. It\u2019s selfish and disgusting and you are doing the one thing judges tell you not to and that is alienating them from friends and family. You have control issues. That custody order isn\u2019t in place for you, it\u2019s in place for the child to have stability.

These kids aren\u2019t here to fill our lives but for us to guide and help them become adult in THEIR LIVES. I hope that your ex wife reports this to the judge bc this is emotional abuse towards your son. Parents like you shouldn\u2019t have any custody bc you are only hurting that child.

Please sit back and reconsider your mindset on this. You also said your son asked his dad to ask you and why wouldn't he just ask you if it was that important? I used to be afraid of my father or knew he could talk circles around me and make me feel small, among other things, and would ask my mom to be the middle man quite often after they were divorced.

You are telling him that you don't care what he wants to do, the only thing that matters is what you want. It's selfish, especially when it comes to school events that he won't get back. Yeah, it's just a dance, but he's a freshman in high school, it's most likely his first REAL dance. He's a kid, let him be a kid and go to his school dance.", "Girl, you did it all wrong. You should\u2019ve been EXCITED to be the one to help him get ready and send him off. That\u2019s a good moment to share with your son.

He didn't plan homecoming. Neither did your ex! No one is doing this just to spite you. You just have a victim complex, or are you so narcissistic that everything must be about you in some way, shape, or form. \n\nLet the kid go to homecoming. Stop limiting him socially.

Clearly.", "YTA", "YTA it isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your child\u2019s growth and development which includes social interaction and life events like homecoming.

He\u2019s not a possession, he\u2019s right to be mad at you for being selfish", "Sorry Op but that was a dumb decision. Your son is getting older and you need to adjust and make that sacrifice. It's not quantity time, it's quality. Why didn't you make a big deal about his 1st homecoming? Why did you punish your son because of your selfishness? Keep it up, he may want his dad to change the custody agreement to even less time with you. \n\n\nFYI at his age, his school friends matter more than his parents. Grow with him not against him.", "You\u2019re being lame asl", "YTA. You will get your son physically that weekend but at what cost? He will probably resent you for missing this life experience. Don\u2019t be selfish and work it out with his father.", "YTA taking his homecoming away from him won't make him any happier to see you lmao. Are you deranged?", "I totally get that you want time with your son, but it\u2019s not his fault that homecoming is on your scheduled day. Homecoming is a big freakin deal for kids. You should accept the dad\u2019s offer of Monday and let your son enjoy homecoming. Bc if not he going to resent you for it", "Yta", "Yta!! These are his last school age memories and rites of passage, it\u2019s normal for our kids to gro up and be a little distant around this time.

You can talk to dad about making up another weekend. Trust me, this sucks. I know the feeling. \n\nI also know you posted this in the Divorce group on FB and got the same answer there that you're getting here. You know what the answer is.

Kid is better off without her", "YATBAHE (you are the biggest asshole ever).  Seeing kids that don't get to be kids because they have crappy \"it's my weekend and you have to spend it with me\" parents is so sad.  The kids are traumatized enough by the separation/divorce.

He went on and on about how the courts had it out for him in front of his son, who he later got full custody of. He talked about all those \u201cmissed years.\u201d\n\nTurned out he never showed up to the hearings and never contested custody or asked for shared custody. He didn\u2019t want to be a parent. He only got custody after his SO became very ill and the son came to live with him.\n\nMade so much sense to me in hindsight, my friend was basically doing all the parenting of his teen though she\u2019d only known him for a year (why she agreed to that I\u2019ll never understand). Taking him to and from school, making his meals, helping him with homework, etc.\n\nSo in the end it wasn\u2019t surprising to me at all that the dad was checked out and was just saving face by claiming the courts screwed him.

It was hard on my husband, but he understood and didn\u2019t object. Beginning in around 8th Grade, she was invited to lots of sleepovers and birthday parties on his weekends. We decided that a good remedy for her spending time elsewhere was to host such at our house on his weekends. Everyone was happy- except my younger son, who somehow always got talked into letting those pesky little girls braid his hair. \n\nThis would have been about 20 years ago, and my husband and I began to wonder whether this was his way of exploring his possible non-hetero sexuality, but even today, we\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t. Our older son\u2019s circle of friends always included both boys and girls, while the younger\u2019s was strictly boys.
