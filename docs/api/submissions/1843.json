Your wife has obviously been thinking on this a lot. You say you have been happy and fulfilled but nothing about your wife feelings. This is on you and not your friends. Maybe the cancer scare was a wake up call for you but by then the damage was done and she knew she was right to leave you. Believe it or not she deserves to be happy and fulfilled too.", "YTA\n\nLia said she *always* felt you didn't love her as much. In other words, this isn't happening purely because Amy spilled the secret. It might have been the straw that broke the camels back, but the rest of the weight (Lia feeling the love was unequal), is the problem that actually needs to be dealt with.\n\nYou are blaming Amy because she is the easiest target and its less painful than looking at your own behaviour to see why Lia didn't feel loved enough by you. If you can put it all on Amy you are then free of any fault and don't have to make any changes in the future.", "YTA Ignoring the fact that you're already the asshole, I feel like there is a big piece of this story that is missing.

Finding out about your cold feet 3 years ago is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and not the rest of the load that\u2019s been building up.

This is much deeper and something between you and your wife, not your friends\u2019 fault. \n\nIf you want to keep her, do the work to convince her that you love her as much as she hopes that you do.

Don\u2019t know why. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But if it\u2019s real, YTA. Keeping a humiliating secret like this from your wife is cruel. It\u2019s like an inside joke with your friends at her expense. You should have found a way to come clean about it before, maybe in a conversation about trust, regrets, and lessons learned. But this was a crappy way for her to find out.", "YTA this should have been a conversation a long long time ago with your wife\u2026 stop blaming your friends for you failure.

There\u2019s more here with Lia and it sounds like you\u2019re trying to blame your divorce on your friends.", "YTA,\n\nThere were better ways to handle this. You could have come clean and told your wife about that moment before the wedding. Then and there only things would have been resolved because your wife learning about this few years later down the marriage will make her feel in doubt about the marriage so far. This was something you should have dealt with in the beginning if you loved her that much. Also, I find it hard to believe that your wife would have wanted to divorce over the slip-up your friend made. Divorce is not an easy decision and is often only made after tolerating something for so long (unless something really bad occurs e.g. cheating). Something tells me that there must have been things lacking or not working out in the marriage. You should talk to your wife and find out what it is, and work on it as well.\n\nSecondly, smashing your friend's gift was a completely unnecessary action. Not only you were rude but you essentially are burning your relationship with your friends over a matter you should have worked out with your wife. You are displacing the anger on your friends.", "YTA you should have told Lia yourself right after the wedding. \"Hey beautiful, I had cold feet for a moment this afternoon and almost ran away, but I was just scared I wasn't good enough for you.

But to be clear, you're the asshole for not saying anything about your escape plan. Lia is not an asshole for wanting to break things off. There's more going on and she's sensed it. \n\nAmy and company are definitely assholes. They should've honored your request for silence on the subject until you were ready. They're definite assholes for acting like divorce is no big deal. And they sure as hell shouldn't have helped you with the escape plan years ago. They should've encouraged you to speak to Lia and not encouraged running away. These people are not your friends. \n\nThe only part you're not an asshole for is breaking the gift. It was kind of expected after what happened. What the hell did they expect? Sunshine and rainbows after potentially breaking a marriage?", "Yeahh YTA. Secrets like this ALWAYS come out. It\u2019s not your friends\u2019 fault that you thought it wouldn\u2019t. You had years to tell your wife about your pre-wedding cold feet, and to reassure her that they were just that, and not an actual reflection of your love and commitment to your wife. By not telling her, you turned it into something way bigger and are now trying to place blame on someone else. Communicate!!", "YTA  You lied to your wife for 3 years.", "YTA. you should have talked about this with your wife way back then. that's on you. you married her under false pretenses. and then you never once revealed to her that you almost ran away and left her at the altar, which allowed that secret to grow. \n\ni'll close with a quote from Elizabeth the Stripper, who gave Michael Scott the following advice:\n\n\"Secrets secrets are no fun. Secrets secrets hurt someone.\"", "YTA- listen this is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. She\u2019s felt this way for a long time. You made her feel like she loves you more than you could ever love her. AND SHE THINKS THERES SOMEONE ELSE YOU LOVE MORE THAN HER. You had years to be honest with her and apparently in her eyes, you treat someone else with more affection than you treat her. Stop blaming your friends and own up to being obtuse to your wife\u2019s feelings", "I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t learn from The Office. \n\n\u201cSecrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone\u201d.", "YTA, for sure. Did you really expect all those people to keep your secret forever?", "ESH.\n\nYou should have had a talk with Lia a long ass time ago. If you had worked through your insecurities with her at the time, perhaps your relationship with her would be intact and stronger for it. Instead you didn't trust her with the most vulnerable parts of yourself. And some nice Lia is leaving, she's sensed that distance before now and this is just confirmation.\n\nAmy should have kept her mouth shut. Drunk is no excuse for letting that sort of thing slip. That's a relationship killer, both yours with Lia and Amy's with you. Why would you want a gift from someone who saw you at your second lowest and then used that info to put you at your lowest? With friends like those, who needs enemies? That sculpture was doomed the instant it crossed your threshold.", "YTA. \n\nThis is something she\u2019s been feeling for awhile as she said it herself. This is not the friends fault.", "ESH except your wife\n\nYour friends broke your trust, BUT\n\nThat was such a major thing you should've told your wife in these 3 years. You messed up by asking your friends to keep it a secret, because they would all think you already told her. You do NOT keep secrets like this from your partner. Also, I have to add, that Lia might be onto something with her *\"That she always thought I didn\u2019t love her as much as she fid me\"* and this spilled into your relationship. If you were contemplating on escaping your own wedding, that 100% translated into your life with Lia.

Massively", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. This situation is sad all around. Seemed the wife had some ill feelings as well and their confession helped her answer. It sucks that you had fallen in love while she was thinking over it. Maybe some counseling", "ESH Except for the wife", "ESH, except your wife. You should have at least told her you were nervous and almost did something stupid at some point instead of allowing enough time to pass for her to be blindsided with the information.

I hope you can sit down and have an honest discussion with your wife to sort things out.", "Rather screaming at those supposed friend why don\u2019t you fight for your wife?

Letters are so underused these days. \n\nWhen she's ready to talk, ask her what she needs from you, what you can do as next steps. Or just go do them, seeing a marriage counselor even if it's alone.

If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d then you can\u2019t say he\u2019s the AH because he didn\u2019t share his insecurities with Lia. 2) If OP had been sexually assaulted and his friends knew, but he didn\u2019t want to share that with anyone, would he be the AH if the friends told his wife, or anyone else for that matter? If your answer is \u201cno,\u201d then saying \u201c3 people can\u2019t keep a secret\u201d as your reason for your judgment is total bull$@##. Lastly, for all the people saying the marriage was already doomed, there is zero evidence of that. Neither OPs comments nor the post reveal any evidence of that, which means the YTA judgment is based on your conjecture. OP is NTA for being mad at his friends. They are total AHs and should be written out of his life. You\u2019re mildly the AH for breaking the gift - mildly. Get yourselves in couples counseling ASAP. Best of luck OP", "Normal cold feet got blown up because you didn\u2019t communicate. Idk why people don\u2019t understand that communication is the foundation of any relationship. Talk to your wife. Tell her how you feel. Get counseling and i hope for the best. Her feelings are hurt. But sometimes a thing is simple a milestone of a marriage. And marriage is work. Put it in. Be apologetic but honest. Tell her how that health-scare made you feel.  Marriage of 66 years happen because ppl put in the work \n\nBest of luck", "I\u2019m gonna have to go with ESH, You should have told your wife a long time ago and your friends had no right to tell her without your consent and even if they did have it, it\u2019s your secret to tell.", "YTA I hope your wife comes to your senses before the year and leaves you. \nYou didn\u2019t have pre wedding jitters, you were fully ready to run away like a child. She deserves better. She should know how you acted. The fact she knew something about you was off just confirms she knew you weren\u2019t good.", "The fact that you knew where the situation was going and said baby\u2026 You seriously thought you could tease her with that to get her to stay? You already knew it was over and didn\u2019t go into that info. YTA. This has nothing to do with the Iranian yogurt and you shouldn\u2019t have ruined the gift.", "YTA. Take responsibility for what YOU did. And if your wife is leaving because of this \u201creveal\u201d\u2014this is just the straw that broke the camels back because she\u2019s been feeling like you don\u2019t love her enough.", "ESH. Except Lia. Oh poor Lia.. Your friends do suck for bringing that up but seeing that Lia wants to divorce..makes me think you had it coming. She said that she felt you never really loved her. Seems to me like you weren\u2019t good at hiding these insecurities and uncertainties during your marriage as well.", "I don't feel like this is the complete story. But YTA for thinking this is something you should've kept from your wife.", "Yta, you had 3 years to tell her.", "ESH except your wife.\n\nYou had 3 years to come clean about it.\nIf you love her as much as you say you do, you'll go to counselling, either as a couple or alone. And work on being honest with her. She's your priority in all of this. Make a genuine effort to improve for the better and learn what her love language is. She's clearly not feeling something she needs from you, you're responsible for seeing to those needs.\n\nYour friends are not your friends if they think the breakup of your marriage isn't a big deal. Cut them out yesterday. They are callous and I'm guessing they don't like your wife and were only too happy to see your marriage ruined. Get better friends.\n\nAs for destroying the gift, I'm gonna say that a violent action even in desperation isn't a good look, you have to have control of your anger.\n\nYou can only have yourself to blame for not being honest for 3 years. And for keeping such awful \"friends\" around that don't sound like they have you or your wife's best interests at heart. If you love your wife you would be protecting her from them, you're supposed to be a package deal.", "I def think YTA. But did you consider that maybe Amy has an ulterior motive for letting that slip? Was it deliberate? Why does your wife think you\u2019re in love with someone else? Did someone give her the idea that you love Amy?", "Why did she already think you did not love her enough? What else did you do?", "INFO: are you and your wife done? Or is there hope?", "YTA - when will people realize \u2018secrets\u2019 are never really secret?? You put into motion a situation where *3* people knew what happened and you expected to add alcohol and have no one ever make a slip up??\n\nSure you can be frustrated that Amy let the secret slip, but cannot make her responsible for this entire situation. Take accountability for your actions as well. Whether triggered by stress or not, Amy only spoke truth.", "I\u2019ll be the unpopular vote I guess. NTA\u2026 At all! Your friends are. To tell you it\u2019s not a big deal, is messed up in so many ways. You ALMOST made a mistake and stopped yourself, you\u2019re only human and that\u2019s ok. You loved her throughout the years, and realized that this was the best choice you\u2019ve made. A lot of married people get scared, and some flee. You faced your fears, and realized the results were even better than you imagined. I hope you guys reconcile, and get couples therapy. Make her feel loved that she doesn\u2019t have to doubt it anymore. Good luck!", "YTA you started your marriage with a lie and think your wife should just be ok with that? You expected your friends to lie for you forever? Your a shitty friend and husband", "YTA and a stupid, coward too. That was her gift you took your anger out on. She\u2019s probably thanking Amy. Your wife is probably going to take this year to get everything arranged so you guys can have a clean break. If she says she has always felt like she\u2019s always loved you more than her - that translates to she can feel that you were not fully invested from the beginning and she doesn\u2019t feel her level of love reciprocated. She had just convinced herself that it was her imagination until the truth came out. Your friends are reflection of yourself BTW. Birds of a feather and all that.", "YTA you and your wife need to work on your marriage don\u2019t blame your friend for an honest mistake. Take responsibility, man up and deal with your problems. I hope you ask your friend for forgiveness as it seems like the situation was highly emotional and I hope that\u2019s why your blaming Amy instead of yourself for your stupid actions.", "YTA like if them telling the truth about a horrible thing you almost did ruined your marriage then maybe the thing you did ruined your marriage. I\u2019m with Lila and I hope she finds someone who loves her in all the moments they are together", "Yup", "Her scare. I noticed that there was a new mole on her skin and it got bigger. Luckily it was benign and they cut the part away. \n\nI don\u2019t know what Lia meant by that. I love her so much.", "They think it\u2019s not a big deal because I\u2019ll find someone else anyways.", "Also, the wife said she felt he didn\u2019t love her as much as she loved him. If he really loved her, what would make her think this way?", "YTA. Exactly. People who write these posts phrase them in a self pitying way.\n\nLook, I find it hard to believe that your wife is leaving you over the fact you potentially might have but didn\u2019t leave her at the altar two years ago. Whether or not you want to acknowledge it, she\u2019s been getting and has continued to get signs you don\u2019t like her as much as she likes you, and she\u2019s right. Amy\u2019s statement just confirmed what she already knew. \n\nIf you guys were in a place of secure attachment, your wife would have laughed it off. But clearly there\u2019s more going on here. Also, why did you marry her at all if you were so desperate to get out of the wedding?\n\nBro, you messed up by not telling her when it happened and working through it. And lastly, you owe Amy a HUGE apology for destroying a gift that belonged to your WIFE!\n\nYou sound like you\u2019re selfish and have rage problems. Why would we sympathize with you?", "YTA my dude. Yeah your friends sucked for spilling your secret, but these things have a way of coming out. Your wife had likely sensed your anxiety and desire to run away from your wedding and it was likely pretty clear to her that you were marrying her with a lot of hesitation. She's carried this all these years. So instead of being honest and talking this through and perhaps go to marital counseling, you decided to just let things be...and this is the result. All that being said, I do hope your wife does give you another chance if you do love her as much as you say you do...", "> did you really expect four people to keep a secret forever?\n\nI expect that my friends can keep important secrets forever.  What kind of friends do you have?", "Totally agree. Amy should've kept the secret, you know, a secret. It wasn't her business to talk about it.\n\nBut OP had 3 whole years to be honest with his wife, and he didn't. Probably the marriage has more issues we don't know about, but if the wife thought about divorce so quickly it's possible that things were going badly anyways.\n\nIt's kinda delusional to think that his 3 friends would keep his *little* secret forever. Those things can't be kept a secret for too long.", "I know it was a fucked up thing to do. That\u2019s why I made them promise to keep it a secret.", "Me too. OP recognizes that he was insecure. I\u2019d love to hear this from Lia\u2019s side", "Me too \ud83d\ude25", "My wife always seemed happy. She never stopped kissing me or going on dates or taking the lunchbox I packed or touching me or anything. We bought a house recently. I\u2019m her emergency contact.", "No I\u2019m not having an affair. There\u2019s no woman out there. The closest thing was that I had a crush on Amy back when we were both kids.", "Yiur turning what someone else said as what the op said himself. He didn't say he didn't love her as much. She did. She is suffering from low self-es teem and heering this only made it worse. You can't be mad at op for being a man and trying to start a family. Its a huge decision for some one to make so i understand why they would be scared and want to run away. I think the most important thing was that he conquered his feer of settling down.", "Exactly! I had a 'run away bride' moment at my wedding but I didn't. I told my husband about it that night because it had simply been wedding jitters, I always knew he was the one for me.", "I thought the same thing when I was reading it.... Fake or at the very least not 100% truthful", "Oh this is absolutely bullshit.", "Yes", "My insecurities were never about her. She was perfect. There was nothing Lia could of done to reassure me.", "the gift was for him, it was HIS birthday party", "That's what I was thinking too. I dated a guy who constantly told me he didn't deserve me and how much he loved me. He also had a 0-100 temper and destroyed things when upset. His actions never had consequences,  it was always the result of someone else screwing things up for him. Funny enough, it never felt like he cared as much as I did. He was also the most manipulative man I've ever met. Some may say him saying \"baby\" was him being out of touch or naive about the situation. It screams manipulation to me, especially since he said in a comment now they unpacked her bags when she wanted to leave. I'm thinking OP is like my ex. \n\nOP, YTA.", "Dude you need to get to the bottom of that shit and fast. \n\nAnd find new friends. \n\nIs it possible she meant Amy? \n\nSince your friends are so dismissive of your wife have they encouraged you to be just as dismissive in other areas of your marriage? \n\nDo you put these \"friends\" first, before your wife? \n\nBecause alot of people get cold feet before they get married, it's a stressful time, bit you had a plan. Was it a last minute plan? Hatched in 30 min or was it days in the making? \n\nYou need to find out why she feels you truly love someone else, and you need to completely cut off those friends, I have a feeling they have been poisoning the well of your marriage for awhile.", "You probably should find other friends. That\u2019s an incredibly callous thing to say to a \u201cfriend\u201d.", "If that's how they feel, they were probably always against the wedding, and the slip wasn't a true \"accident\".", "Oh they are bad friends but you should have told your wife.\n\nCan you both try counseling or is she set on going?", "And to be with who he really loved? That's needs more explaining.", "Insecurity and low self esteem.\n\n(Not saying she actually is insecure or hasow self esteem, this is just a general statement/answer to your question...but insecurity makes you think a lot of crazy shit. I am speaking from experience, sadly.)", ">It's kinda delusional to think that his 3 friends would keep his little  secret forever. Those things can't be kept a secret for too long.\n\n\"Three can keep a secret if two are dead\".\n\nAnd frankly, even just the one person knowing is no guarantee. At the point that four people know (including OP), its not a secret. End of.\n\nYou say delusional - you are being generous lol", "But why didn't you talk to your wife about it?  You could have told her on your 1st anniversary how scared you were before you got married and how stupid you realize you were being because she makes you happier than anything on earth.  You could have salvaged this by TELLING THE TRUTH! If the success of your marriage depends on a lie you don't have a successful marriage.", "I dont know how old you are, but at the point four people know the 'secret', its no longer a secret and its incredibly naive to think otherwise. I imagine a whole bunch of people knew within a month flat. The spread is exponential.", "So you destroyed your own marriage. \n\n\nIf you had a plan to run on your wedding day that's not just jitters.  That's cancel the wedding and talk it out. \n\nYou were immature and not honest. \n\n\nYta", "And you should have told Lia sometime in the past three years.\n\nI can guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t have said what she said if she didn\u2019t realize on some level that you were unreliable.\n\nYTA", "If you know you screwed up then hold yourself accountable, don't hide the mistake.

For real?", "Women know how to fake it", "That\u2019s because your wife loved YOU unconditionally. Her problem (which was partially confirmed by your friends) was that she didn\u2019t think you loved her as much. Maybe you do love her that much now, but obviously you didn\u2019t for even a while after the marriage.", "Lia absolutely meant something by that comment. And it sure is interesting that the person you have history with is the same person who brought up you nearly leaving your wife at the altar.", "Does Amy have feelings for you? Something seems odd with the comment your wife said.", "Oop, there it is.", "But ... *he's her emergency contact.*", "You literally started your future together with one of the biggest lies possible. I saw in another comment you mentioned you had a crush on Amy as kids, I think that\u2019s what your soon to be ex-wife meant about being with who you love. I\u2019m sorry ESH but mostly you and certainly not Lia in any way", "She is too good for you, my man. You should let her go so she can be with someone that didn't plan to dump her at the alter.", "Did Amy and Max even try and talk to you about your relationship, or just jump straight to agreeing you should leave. \nMy friends would talk to me about what\u2019s going on, and help me think things through. Yours, not so much. They don\u2019t sound great", "Check the last paragraph.", "I didn\u2019t get the impression that Lia meant OP loved a specific someone else more, but that he could love someone else more.
