I very much did not but I loved my husband and I agreed to adopt. So long as my husband agreed to be the stay at home parent because I have a great career and he works from home. \n\nIt took two years but we finally adopted a baby from my husband's birth country. As planned my husband stayed home with our new son. \n\nEverything went well for the first little while but then my husband said that we needed a nanny because working and having a child was difficult. No shit Sherlock. \n\nThat was the beginning of the end. Lots of fighting about child care. More about budgets. Even more about living with the consequences of our choices. \n\nWe divorced and my husband got custody and I pay child support. \n\nI saw my son grow up and I loved him very much. We spent time together and I took him on holidays that I otherwise never would have taken. \n\nWhen my son was 14 I got a sizable bonus at work. I talked to my accountant and lawyer and I paid the next four years of child support in a lump sum. My ex had some expenses and he needed money. He was also an amazing parent and I knew he was never going to not take good care of our son. \n\nMy ex took the money and used it to take care of his stuff. \n\nWhen our son turned 16 he bought him a motorcycle. I thought it was a terrible idea but it wasn't my call. \n\nLong story short I was right. My son died and my ex was badly injured trying to reach him on a road trip on their motorcycles. \n\nIt has been six months and I approached my ex about getting the child support back because there is no child. \n\nHe called me heartless and an asshole for even thinking of the money right now. I left and put it all in my lawyer's hands. My ex's family is now bad-mouthing me to everyone for \"expecting a refund\". \n\nI don't think I'm in the wrong but maybe I am.\n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT \n\nThank you whomever directed me to seek help from Reddit counseling.

Please ignore people here who are slamming you. Everyone processes grief differently and I also would be upset at the idea of my ex keeping a windfall after they bought the thing that killed our child.\n\nI think the main problem is one of language. You are not asking for a refund but rather return of an unused portion. Refund sounds heartless.", "NTA\n\nI suspect that you're going to get a lot of comments about the very rational, matter-of-fact manner in which you've written your post. Mine won't be amongst them, because for a variety of reasons I understand that how people choose their words is not always a full or accurate representation of their hearts.\n\nDespite your very sensible turn of phrase . . . despite everything that has happened . . . it did not escape my notice that you had the generosity of heart to still call your ex-husband \"an amazing parent\". I disagree. I think he was likely a very loving parent who adored his son. But I would argue that no \"amazing\" parent - no parent who puts *parenting* their child ahead of being their best friend - buys a child a donorcycle at 16. There is no world in which it is in any adolescent's best interests to own or ride a motorcycle. Period. And yet, despite the fact that he did this in the face of your disapproval, and that it literally led to your child's death . . . you still come here and have the grace to call your ex an \"amazing parent\". That speaks volumes of your character, and your good heart. \n\nPeople grieve differently. Again, I suspect there are going to be some ugly comments here, but it seems to me that this is your quiet but firm way of grieving the abject horror your ex-husband's irresponsible behaviour - indeed, WITH the money you gave him for the care and support of your child, specifically - has wrought on your lives. You aren't shrieking or rending your clothes. But he took the money meant to care for your child, and not-so-indirectly caused your son's death. That you have asked him to return the rest of the money - money that never was his to spend to begin with, outside of protecting your son's welfare -absolutely does not make you an AH. It is not only your legal right, but it is your right as a grieving mother. It is gesture of pain. Not vengeance, just . . . pain. And you are absolutely NTA.", "NAH.\n\nHe's not an AH for feeling hurt that you are thinking about the money. You're not an AH for expecting to pay only the child support that is actually owed.  \n\nPersonally I would never have paid the child support in advance, no matter what the co-parent's needs were.  The child needs support (food, clothing, shelter) on a monthly basis, and it is too easy for the co-parent to misuse those funds when given in a lump sum.", "OP stated that her ex used the lump sum of child support to buy equity in his company in addition to his own savings (super risky in my opinion to take a lump sum of money meant for your child and use it in a business deal that could go bad) and he did NOT spend it on your son. \n\nOP also had insurance that covered the final medical and funeral expenses. \n\nShe deserves the money back from when her son died to his 18th birthday that she paid in advance, that\u2019s 2 years worth of child support that the ex no longer needs and that he already spent buying equity in a company. \n\nIt is not fair that he is using money OP worked their butt off for to advance his own career especially now that their son is gone due to his own ridiculous decision to get him a donor cycle and take it on a road trip to \u201cteach\u201d him.

Your ex probably has a lot of guilt to work through after losing your son, and six months is not a lot of time to process that grief. I think you may have messed up in the ask timing, and I think your ex messed up by letting his grief control his reaction to your ask.\n\nFrom what you've written, it seems like your ex went through a lot of trauma surrounding your son's death, physically and mentally. I'm sure you also grieved for this loss.\n\nI think you do have a right to ask for child support back, but I think it was a bit callous to start that conversation so soon. To be honest, I don't think anyone on Reddit would have the ability to know when was the right time, but from your ex's reaction this wasn't the time. Maybe it was the way the conversation went. Who knows, but you two?\n\nI believe that you have a good heart. You supported your ex and son even when adoption wasn't what you wanted, and even spent time with him post-divorce. You were willing to pre-pay your child support when asked.\n\nYour ex is also likely a good person. He cared for your son for years, and seemed to be amicable with you. \n\nYou've both been hurt by this situation, and you both need to communicate with the intent to understand each other.

It would be tactless to do it too soon after, but it\u2019s been 6 months and he hasn\u2019t returned it yet, so of course you\u2019re going to ask at some point.  \n   \nIt\u2019s honestly kinda disgusting from the ex to use this as an excuse to get money out of you, if that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, especially given that it wasn\u2019t just his child but both of yours. From a \u201cmoral\u201d standpoint, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the money belongs to you, so he\u2019s the one at fault for fighting this legally", "NTA. In the same light that you would be released from paying child support in the very unfortunate event of your son's death, the support you paid in advance should come back to you.  You're not asking for a \"refund\", its money you wouldn't have paid had you originally had the regular payments. Child support is for supporting the children, not to help the other parent with their own money problems.  \n\nIt's like paying someone to do a job for you, a job that's going to take awhile and instead of paying installments you pay it all up front. They end up not doing that job and the job is cancelled, you should have that money sent back to you. \n\nVery sorry for the loss of your son. It feels disgusting to think about money in a time like that but it still has to be dealt with.", "Yes, child support is for the child, it\u2019s in the name.", "Need info: What were the expenses you paid the lump sum for?", "Not wrong.  The child support is not payable when the child has died.  My condolensces & NTA", "I think this really depends on the laws in your country. Perhaps NAH?\n\nMy understanding of a lump sum agreement is that you pay for the upcoming years based on what you currently would owe for years. The benefit is that the support wouldn\u2019t then increase if you began to make more during that time. The risk is if things changed for the worse you couldn\u2019t argue that you paid too much.\n\nI could be completely wrong with that logic but if that\u2019s the case then I don\u2019t think you are owed anything, but again I\u2019m not a lawyer and I don\u2019t know the relevant laws.\n\nI will say I am getting a sense that the desire for the money is coming from a place, at least a little bit, or wanting to punish your ex for allowing your son to have a motorcycle. That you feel, at least a little, that he is to blamed for what happened and this is a way to get justice.\n\nI also think that your journey towards motherhood isn\u2019t relevant towards your question about child support, and yet because you *think* it is relevant it\u2019s something very strongly on your mind. I imagine you are grappling with motherhood and what it means to you.\n\nLet the lawyers deal with the money while you seek help for yourself to process your grief.

NAH? \n\nMy judgement is that this is honestly the risk you chose to take in paying child support as a lump sum, which is not the normal way of doing so. I'm sorry for your loss, and I can empathize with you not wanting your ex to keep the money when you probably view your ex as causing your kid's death. But call the other two years of child support your contribution to the funeral or something and let it go. I don't think fighting over money is good for either of you's recovery from the grief.", "NAH your husband got 4 years child support for 2 years of care, but the money is gone and he relied on it so he could raise the kid you agreed to.

He never asked you to do it. It worked out for everyone at the time. No one knew what was going to happen. You never had the money, and as you say, you are financially okay so what does it matter now?\n\nYou have lost a son. No money returned from your ex will fix it or make you feel better.\n\nMy opinion here would be to let the money, grieve how you want and move on however you choose.", "NTA\n\nIt is the principle.\n\nI am sorry for the loss of your son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't consider my ex TAH because everyone grieves differently. For me, it's been more than 3 years since the loss and it would still feel \"too soon\" but IMO since you paid ahead for the purpose of your ex making more, he should've then been able to replenish the child support \"fund\" account and easily have the 2 years available. Your individual finances may have changed so much that this was money you had over paid. Even without over paying, had her been wise and placed 3 of the 4 years into a high interest savings account your money would've made him extra (no problem if going towards the kid) but it's still interest you didn't make.

How you ask may be a bit much, but people grieving should be given more leeway than normal.\n\nIf you can ask him to talk with you, so you can explain your reasoning, he might be more understanding.

People are acting like you're the one obsessed with money, but if he didn't care about the money he would've just given it back right away. So they should be criticizing him too if they think you're so wrong. The hard truth is that your ex no longer has a child to support, therefore the money you paid in advance no longer has that purpose. The money was never for him, it was for your son.

However, there are also restrictions on how the recipient of child support can be treated. A paying parent cannot say \"They're using my child support for vacations instead of the child's needs!\" - there is a legal presumption support is used as appropriate by the recipient, and (absent going to court because the kid is sleeping on a dirt floor while the recipient has no job and drives a new Mercedes bought with child support) no court wants to listen to people fight over how money is being spent.\n\nShe could have set up some annuity or something that pays out monthly, but because it is still being paid monthly there would still be the opportunity to have her obligation increased if the recipient asked the court (because the annuity is paid monthly, so the underlying value of the account can be increased to increase the monthly payment).\n\nAbsent a trust account that can only be used for the kid, a lump sum was her only viable option to avoid an increased obligation down the road - and a trust would require the other parent agreeing to have support managed this way (because courts treat support as necessary to have available to pull from as needed based on the overall household circumstances). Based on the kid's age, it sounds like she paid out through his age of emancipation so she would never have to deal with the issue...it just did not end well because of how the recipient chose to spend it.\n\nIn any event, child support is the right of the child so she is owed her money back.

You be the judge!\n\n> Title: AITA for Seeking Child Support Refund After My Son's Passing?\n\nHey Reddit,\n\nI find myself in a tough situation and could really use some perspective on whether I'm the A-hole in this situation. Here's the story:\n\nA few years ago, my ex-partner and I went through a tough breakup. We had a child together, and as a result, I was ordered to pay child support. I complied with the court order and paid child support faithfully to support my son.\n\nTragically, my son passed away a few months ago due to a severe illness. It's been a heartbreaking experience, and I've been struggling to cope with the loss. However, here's where the issue arises:\n\nI've learned that, legally, I am still obligated to pay child support until the court order is officially modified. My ex-partner has been receiving the payments even though our son is no longer with us. This has been bothering me for several reasons. First, it feels wrong to continue paying child support for a child who is no longer alive. Second, I could use the financial support to help cover the medical bills and funeral expenses related to my son's passing.\n\nI consulted with a lawyer who advised me to seek a modification of the child support order, but it also means pursuing a refund for the payments I've made since my son's death. I decided to go ahead with the legal process, as it seems like the right thing to do given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, my ex-partner and some mutual friends are furious with me. They argue that I'm heartless for pursuing this refund and that I should just let it go. They claim that it's money I owed for the time my son was alive, and it's not about the money, but about honoring his memory.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the A-hole for suing to get my child support back after my son's passing? I'm genuinely torn about this situation and would appreciate your honest opinions. Thanks for your input.", "Yea, nothing's showing up for any 16 year olds dying driving a motorcycle 5-7 months ago.

Child support is not meant to be used for the child, it's meant to make it so that the financial burden from raising the child is equally born by both guardians. I know that sounds like semantics, but it's why back child support goes to the parent and not the kid even if the kid is an adult. Because the money WAS spent on the kid, it just only came from one parent so the other parent is owed restitution. It's why it's completely fine to use a child support payment for your own needs because the assumption isn't that the money will go to the kids, but that an equivalent amount will go to the kid's care.\n\nSo, if I pay my rent, which is higher because my kid needs a room, and then get a child support payment and use that to go to the doctor or put it into my personal savings, it's fine because the child support money is not a special fund. It's just meant to make it so that overall spending is balanced.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the dad didn't use the money directly for the kid shouldn't be an issue because that money isn't specifically earmarked for the kid. He's just owed it to lessen the financial burden of raising the kid, so investing it and using future funds for the kid is totally fine. \n\nObliviously there are cases where people misuse their child support, but nothing about this makes it feel like this is that kind of case.\n\nHopefully I explained that clearly!", "The presumption for child support in many (if not most) places is that the recipient parent will use in a way that benefits the child even if it is not directly spent on the child, and claims related to how child support is being spent are barred absent specific, limited circumstances. Child support is the right of the child, not the recipient parent. Legally speaking, at least in the areas I am familiar with, she is entitled to get the money back because her obligation terminated upon the passing of her son.\n\nI also don't think she's morally in the wrong at all. Her ex spent the money on something she objected to, as is his right, and now they have no living child. For him to be allowed to keep the amounts that extend beyond the termination of her obligation would effectively be adding insult to injury.", "The lesson of the sub is that weddings cause women to forget how to behave like human beings, apparently.", "I got ran over by an electric scooter as a pedestrian (dumbest story on the planet, but I was not at fault, the idiot on the scooter purposefully hit me).

Yes, the parent is still the one that receives the back support if that becomes an issue, but the legal definitions of everything are a bit different where I am than your interpretation.\n\nYou are correct overall, but I think it's important to remind people everything is area dependent.
