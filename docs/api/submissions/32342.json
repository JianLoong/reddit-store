My boys were all \"that's okay, don't worry about it\" etc and asking me if they could help me with my business at all. My step daughter on the other hand was pissed. Immediately giving us an attitude, saying the stuff on her Christmas list was a \"need\", not a want, and we need to figure it out or we were going to ruin the Christmas spirit for her (the new iPhone, apple watch, Gucci purse- which is NOT a need by any means). I didn't say anything. But that might I had to go out and buy the boys new jackets because they'd outgrown theirs.

That her insecurities since the baby is causing her to be selfish, entitled and dramatic and it's adding to my mental load and I can't handle it. I already feel guilty about the Christmas gifts without her adding to it and that she could show some empathy like my boys do, who offered their help versus make me feel like shit. He got defensive and said his daughter wasn't selfish, entitled or dramatic and that we are failing the kids because my business is going under.\n\nETA: I do NOT want my husband to tell her she's being selfish, entitled or dramatic. I stayed in my post that I want him to talk to her and explain to her that she is still loved regardless of the gifts and talk to her about showing some empathy. Sorry for not explaining that properly. Everything else in the last paragraph was me explaining WHY I want him to talk to her, not a \"this is what you need to tell her\". She is in therapy (so is me and my husband).

A failing business is not failing your children. They don't need or deserve hugely expensive gifts. She is a teenager so by definition she is selfish and dramatic. It's what teens do.

I have a daughter and I think the whole \"princess\" mindset is absolutely disgusting. Ya'll should have raised her better.", "YTA. You don\u2019t give a shit about the daughter that he \u2018came into the relationship with\u2019 and it shows with every sentence. You sound like a toxic boy mom and it\u2019s super cringe.

You're not failing anybody because your business is failing due to your health. \n\nFeel free to point out that he's failing as both a parent and spouse.", "I'm not a fan of how many people are excusing her behavior because she's a teen. Yes, teens can be little shits at times. But at 14, she's old enough to understand pricey luxury Christmas gifts are not a need.", "I\u2019m also interested in this. To shame his wife with PPD for the failings business? WTF? What did he do to ensure OP didn\u2019t loose her business while carrying their child?", "The baby is 3 month old, I\u2019m pretty sure OP doesn\u2019t want her husband taking on another job and leaving her even more alone with the baby especially since she is struggling with PPD/PPA. \n\nHe became unexpectedly (because apparently neither he nor OP predicted the decline in business) the sole earner of what was previously a 2 income household. I think it\u2019s fair to say his income goes to household needs. They did fail the children by not foreseen her business decline. She might have been able to hire someone for a short time if they did, we\u2019ll never know.\n\nThe daughter is entitled and at 14, it\u2019s because she was raised that way. It\u2019s definitely time for OPs husband to teach her otherwise.", "To be fair to the girl, this seems to be such a normalised ask for parents these days although most will either not deliver or be unable to afford it.\nI had a work friend, family member & multiple casual acquaintances tell me that their kids requested Gucci products (yes Gucci specifically) apple products and jordans for Christmas and birthdays.", "I never even had a list lol, I would just take whatever my mom decided to brought for me", "Six years is not newly blended, but according to OP's comments, Abby is insecure about the baby.

My dad lost his job, and we were worried about being homeless for a few months. \n\nWas I disappointed in the knock off iPod I got for Christmas that year? Yeah.

No. I was thankful to my parents for even going out of their way to do what they could.\n\nShe's beyond old enough to know otherwise.", ">A teen girl is behaving like a teen. That's normal\n\nDisagree. Asking for a Gucci purse, apple watch and iphone all in one year (unless it's genuinely an inconsequential amount for your family) is a pretty serious red flag for being unusually spoilt and greedy. Personally that kind of request is worth a serious chat in itself about having financial awareness of your family's situation. \n\nBut throwing a huge tantrum when your family is struggling financially and can't buy you designer gear? Her dad needs to have a serious talk with her and start working on how to improve her attitude long term. 14 is too old to be acting like this, and the teens I knew who behaved this way turned into shitty adults,", "You need to work on your reading comprehension.", "How was she supposed to know she was going to suffer from PPD? How was she supposed to know that it would be so bad that her business would suffer? \n\n& this is their only child together. \n\nThis is an absolute garbage take. \n\nIt\u2019s not like the 14 year old was told only she isn\u2019t getting anything, no one is going to have the christmas they expected.", "Did we read the same post?\n\nSince when kids not having the newest iPhone, Apple watch and a fucking overpriced designer handbag is a \"financially bad situation\"?

These are status symbols for the millionaires.\n\nOP never told kids that there will be no Christmas gifts at all. She merely stated that the price of the gifts they can have will be cheaper. Kids getting moderately priced Christmas gifts that do not qualify as millionaire status symbols is perfectly normal.\n\nOr do you believe that 99.999% of humanity are assholes, because they do not give their kids overpriced status symbols for Christmas gifts?", "Yall kill me that shit.. oh let me have a child run my life. Please shut that up.", "Do you think she\u2019s psychic? How is she or anyone supposed to know that her pregnancy would cause such serious health issues?

That doesn\u2019t mean we need to abstain from giving them siblings.\n\nOP\u2019s not saying the kids won\u2019t get gifts, she\u2019s saying they\u2019ll get their needs met, but a limited number of \u201cwants\u201d met. To me that sounds like, \u201cexpect clothes, maybe fun toiletries, a reasonably inexpensive item from your wish list.\u201d No-one is being deprived or suffering because they can\u2019t have the newest iPhone or a designer bag. Those are LUXURIES, not expectations. Even if they were affordable last year, that doesn\u2019t mean anyone\u2019s entitled to them this year.\n\nOP was in a solid financial position until an unusually difficult pregnancy and postpartum experience.

I feel sorry for you.", "Wth stop projecting.\n\nOp said they sat the kids down and said Christmas wasn't going to be that great gift-wise, not that it was cancelled outright. That might just mean they have to stick to a budget per kid, rather than buying them everything on their wish lists.", "Big assumption.

One of those problems parents of teens typically have to fix or work with. Like dealing with crushes, jealousy, age typical drama among teen friend groups...

This girl's issues are understandable. Dealing with such stuff is among the usual parenting tasks.

Is her bio mother willing to help foot the bill? Is she feeding this attitude, that none of your other children have (that are also notably absent her influence)? I know teenagers can be selfish; but this seems a little extreme. Even at my most selfish, I reckon if I\u2019d gotten as many toiletries/sweeties as my siblings did I\u2019d be grateful.

OP can try to get her husband to stifle the behaviour with punishment, or they can try to get at the root cause.", "I mean there needs to be punishment either way. It doesn't matter if there is underlying insecurities at play. Lashing out and trying to bait the OP is not acceptable (Let's be real, it's baiting when she's trying to make her step mother the bad guy over something that was a need, ie the jackets.). It's disrespectful.\n\nBeing soft is just going to validate the behavior if there are no actual consequences.\n\nI would say therapy is definitely needed for her, but there needs to be a consequence if she continues this behavior. Enabling it will not help and she needs to be taught that talking is better rather than lashing out and getting grounded over it."]}
