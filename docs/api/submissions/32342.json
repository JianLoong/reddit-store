I said this to my husband and asked him to speak to her. We have 4 kids total. I came in to the relationship with 2 sons (13 and 7) and he came in to the relationship with a daughter, Abby (14). We now have a daughter together, who is 3 months old. We have full custody of all the kids and have for the 6 years we have been together. My sons father died when I was pregnant with my youngest son. Abby's bio mom sees her every other weekend. \n\nSo I own and operate my own business and it was very profitable up until I got pregnant. I had a lot of health issues during the pregnancy and lost a good chunk of clients because I wasn't readily available for their business. After I had our daughter I was diagnosed with PPA/PPD and honestly, up until a couple weeks ago I didn't even want to get out of bed. It's been a rough few months. But due to this, my company is going under and money has been tight. My husband and I sat the kids down yesterday and basically told them that Christmas wasn't going to be that great this year- gift wise. That most of our money would be tied in to needed stuff, more so than wanted stuff. My boys were all \"that's okay, don't worry about it\" etc and asking me if they could help me with my business at all. My step daughter on the other hand was pissed. Immediately giving us an attitude, saying the stuff on her Christmas list was a \"need\", not a want, and we need to figure it out or we were going to ruin the Christmas spirit for her (the new iPhone, apple watch, Gucci purse- which is NOT a need by any means). I didn't say anything. But that might I had to go out and buy the boys new jackets because they'd outgrown theirs. I come home and Abby flipped out. \"So let me get this straight, you tell me that you can't get me what I want for Christmas but you go out and buy them jackets with the money you supposedly don't have? And you don't even ask me if I want one too? Make it make sense.\" She literally just got a brand new jacket in September. I tell her this. She accused me of playing favorites. \"Just say you would rather spend money on your kids so we can move on\". My husband overheard, takes her phone and tells her to go to her room. \n\nLater on in the evening I asked my husband to speak to his daughter and explain to her that nothing has changed and that we still love her regardless if we can get her gifts. That her insecurities since the baby is causing her to be selfish, entitled and dramatic and it's adding to my mental load and I can't handle it. I already feel guilty about the Christmas gifts without her adding to it and that she could show some empathy like my boys do, who offered their help versus make me feel like shit. He got defensive and said his daughter wasn't selfish, entitled or dramatic and that we are failing the kids because my business is going under.\n\nETA: I do NOT want my husband to tell her she's being selfish, entitled or dramatic. I stayed in my post that I want him to talk to her and explain to her that she is still loved regardless of the gifts and talk to her about showing some empathy. Sorry for not explaining that properly. Everything else in the last paragraph was me explaining WHY I want him to talk to her, not a \"this is what you need to tell her\". She is in therapy (so is me and my husband). She started a month ago because she said she's been insecure since the baby came because she's not the only girl anymore and \"won't be treated like the princess of the house anymore\".", "created_utc": 1701713228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aq49w/aita_for_saying_my_daughter_was/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand it\u2019s more frustrating because the boys were way more understanding and it\u2019s a pity she can\u2019t see your side the way they have. I think you was in your right to ask your husband to speak to her and try to make her see both of the sides. If you already know she has insecurities since the baby maybe it\u2019s best to communicate that with her and reassure her as this reaction may be more than just the Christmas presents - she might be feeling neglected. It might be best to have you and your husband both talk to her and make sure she\u2019s doing okay and try to reconcile that way. I do think she may be quite spoiled though as it seems she just expects all these designer and expensive things, they aren\u2019t needs at all!", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jesus fuck, how successful were you guys for her to have had this kind of stuff on her Christmas list. \n\nA big problem I see her is when you say things like \u201cmy boys\u201d. If I\u2019m a 14yo kid and I hear that I\u2019m definitely going to feel a bit isolated and secondary. Idk what your dynamic is but I personally would avoid that kind of talk. \n\nI get dad being defensive, it\u2019s his girl and that\u2019s were harsh words, even if they were true. Especially when you compare her to \u201cyour boys\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the AH here but you guys need to work on the language you decide to use.", "YTA\n\nYes, she is acting that way, but having her father say to that her isn\u2019t really helpful. It\u2019s hard enough being 14, having your lifestyle change around you (new baby, failing finances, one parent with PPD), plus she\u2019s the odd man out in your family, and she obviously feels that.\n\nHer behaviour needs to be addressed but not by making her dad give her a laundry list of how shitty she is.", "INFO- Is her mom still alive? Does she have a good relationship with her? How did your relationship start? How did you and your husband integrate your families when you first got together?", "NTA. Wanting a new phone, Apple Watch and Gucci bag does make her selfish, entitled and overly dramatic.", "NTA.\n\nBut your husband may be. None of this is your fault and yes that list is not needs but wants. I would recommend a family therapist given you are saying her behavior started when the new baby came into the picture.\n\nYour husband needs to get a clue, he heard what she said and I'm assuming he knows what the issue was about. You are not failing your kids on Christmas if the gifts are not expensive tech or designers.", "Holy crap, your husband is just as messed up as his daughter is. A failing business is not failing your children. They don't need or deserve hugely expensive gifts. She is a teenager so by definition she is selfish and dramatic. It's what teens do. And I know he feels bad about not being able to give her the expensive, unnecessary things she wants. But he is an adult and he needs to become rational about this. There is no need to tell her she's being dramatic and selfish. But she does need to stop taking out her disappointment on someone who already feels horrible. He needs to be the parent here. So sorry you're going through this.", "NTA but your stepdaughter and your husband are \u2026 she\u2019s all those things u described and he needs to check her instead of blaming your business", "Oh no, I didn't bring my boys up to him at all. My last paragraph wasn't explained properly. I was saying that to you guys and started over explaining and got off topic. I was basically telling you guys why it bothered me. But I didn't say that to my husband. All I told him was that she was acting selfish, entitled and dramatic since the baby came and asked him to speak to her about showing some empathy because it's getting disrespectful at this point. I didn't bring the boys in to it with him.", "Adding due to extra info - it\u2019s revolting if they blame you for not having a good Christmas, you have gone through a massive trauma and having PPD, I hope you are doing okay now OP, but it\u2019s totally unfair they are treating you this way, it\u2019s not your fault for what\u2019s happened at all, keep reminding yourself of that.", "If you'll actually *read* OP's post, she doesn't blame *their* money woes on his daughter. She very clearly says her business is failing because of health issues relating to her pregnancy with a different child.  And she doesn't blame that child either.\n\nSo the premise of your post is just wrong.\n\nThe daughter *is* selfish, entitled and dramatic.  The family is having money issues and she insists on a new iPhone, Apple watch and Gucci purse?  Yeah, right.  She gets angry because her stepbrothers get new jackets (a *need*, not a luxury) -- and she got one herself a few months ago? Her father should be having a talk with her.\n\nOP, businesses sometimes flounder.  A personal services business is especially at risk when the provider of those services gets ill.  From what we can tell, you're not at fault.  You *would* be at fault if you ignored financial realities and bought the entitled kid luxury stuff you can't afford. Her father is at fault for not dealing with her behavior and for not supporting you through this difficult time.", "How is needed jackets any comparison to iPhones and purses? She can be upset if she wants but it was a need vs a want and I don't need her coming for my throat about it.", "OP is not putting the blame of her money woes on her stepdaughter\u2014she was realistically alerting the kids to the consequences of a reduced Christmas budget. The stepdaughter reacted in a selfish, dramatic and entitled (newsflash\u2014a Gucci purse is not a need, lol) way to her disappointment, which is pretty normal stuff for someone of her age. It\u2019s also normal for parents to call out this kind of behaviour on their teens so they don\u2019t grow up to be brats. NTA", "Yeah, but she is being dramatic. The jackets were because the boys needed. What was the OP meant to do? Not buy them and let them freeze so that her daughter could feel better?", "[deleted]", "I don't refer to them as \"my boys\" outside of this post. I always say \"my kids\" talking about ALL of them (Abby included). I treat them all the same. I call her my daughter, though she throws in my face all the time that she has a mom and she's not mine. I said it for the nature of this post to keep it within character limit and to just get the point across without over explaining.", "But she neeeeeeeeeds them!!!", "She\u2019s 14, she\u2019s the \u201cother\u201d in the family, and her life is changing around her. She needs a talking to but one that seeks to let her express herself and feel heard, get reassured over things she\u2019s worried about, while still maintaining that how she\u2019s acting is not OK.", "It wasn't a jab. She said she was insecure since the baby came. She's in therapy for it.", "It sounds like she\u2019s really having a hard time feeling like she fits into your family, feeling like she\u2019s one of you all. I understand why you resent her for acting out but there\u2019s an obvious theme here, that she know she doesn\u2019t belong the way everyone else does, and she\u2019s acting out to get ahead of and take control of the hurt feelings.", "But she's a teeeeeeeeenager! Her brain is still deveeeeeeeloping! Life is harrrrrrrrd for her!\n\nOP you are definitely NTA. The girl is selfish, entitled, and dramatic.", "Exactly, she's fourteen yet the younger kids have more maturity than her.\n\nThere is no \"other\" here. This family has been blended since she was 8 years old.\n\nBased on what the OP is saying in the comments, this kid doesn't view OP as her mother and has thrown that in her face. Like yes she has her birth mother, but her step mother has been trying and this is how she's being treated", "She\u2019s being immature but I expect that from a 14yo. Your brain gets all out of whack at that age, everything can feel hard and upsetting. You start to have more complex, independent emotions about things but lack the life experience and mental stability to process them properly. \n\nShe is \u201cother\u201d because the two boys and the new baby have only one mother and father in their lives, one home. There\u2019s nothing else for it, but it\u2019s clear she feels separate from the others.", "I just don't have any sympathy for her in that sense.\n\nThe father of the boys passed away, she still has her birth mother and visits her as well. The situations are entirely different. There's nothing in the post that says she's being separated by anyone but herself.", "Oh I don\u2019t mean that anyone is doing it to her, but it\u2019s  going to be unavoidably obvious in her daily life that she\u2019s the only one with a stepparent.\n\nEg: OP did refer to the boys as \u201cmy boys\u201d and to the girl as \u201chis daughter.\u201d Which is true and unavoidable (as she does have a mother, who is in her life.)\n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d be seeking to make her feel included and reassured while still drawing a line at unacceptable behaviour.", "If you read OP's comments, this kid hasn't been making it easy either and she didn't bring up the boys to her husband in terms of who had better behavior"]}
