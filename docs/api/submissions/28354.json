I am a woman so I get being cautious, but she could totally give them the wrong number or go to the bartender and say she feels unsafe.

Probably time to find another girl", "NTA - free drinks? She seems to enjoy exploiting other people for gain at the expense of your feelings.

If you do, then have no fear & allow them the freedom to make their decisions. If you don't, then just move on. You also have to accept that while unpleasant things could come from your partner being away, they could only arise if your partner makes the necessary decisions to let them, and if they do, then while painful, you've ultimately been done a favor. A person you were invested in who wasn't who you thought they were has outed themselves as such & now you're free to move on in pursuit of healing & finding the actual right one for you. I took a real detour here, I'm sorry if it wasn't as helpful as I thought it might be.\n\nTL;DR - it's sketchy, but if you trust her, then trust her.

Ever hear of \"periods\" or \"commas\" let alone more esoteric punctuation marks?", "NAH. I\u2019ve been in this position too many times to count and, honestly, sometimes it really _is_ easiest to just give someone your number so they will finally leave you alone. I used to do that and then block the number. Giving a fake number doesn\u2019t always work because I\u2019ve had a lot of guys call the number immediately, most likely to check it isn\u2019t a fake one. \n\nTo the people that I\u2019m sure will say \u201cwhy can\u2019t she just tell them no\u201d, well\u2026 safe to say they probably have never been in that situation. It isn\u2019t easy and a lot of guys literally will not take no for an answer and that could be difficult for someone who dislikes confrontation (as was my case when I was younger). \n\nGiving her IG out for free drinks is a bit different, but the fact that she literally came to you and asked if you\u2019d be comfortable with that shows that she didn\u2019t have any bad intentions. I would say go get your free drinks! BUT. She does need to respect that you may not feel comfortable with this and not push it. \n\nAlso\u2026 please ignore the people who are already insinuating that she\u2019s a cheat.

(But i dont go to bars and stuff so these are men on the street and at the store, etc so it is different in that regard) \n\nAfter talking it through what i do is give his number or my older brothers, because when i get nervous and want to get away i cant make up a number, thinking clearly is hard for me in those moments. But my bf also understands that there have been incidents where they push for instagram so he knows i give it when im feeling really uncomfortable. \n\nFrom reading this my biggest concern would be her giving her number to get free drinks and the fact that she keeps giving her number at the bar. I dont accept free stuff if it comes with a string. I dont even feel fully comfortable accepting it all the time and have denied multiple guys who seemed too eager/creepy. It just opens up the door to too many dangerous or messy situations.  \n\nAs for the few times i went to a bar, it was really clear to tell who was into me and yes i always go with friends/a group so i just stick with them. One time i legit pretended to sleep at a table by closing my eyes and resting my head bc this creep came and sat by me when my friends got up to try and talk. I personally think its easy to avoid having to associate with creeps at the bar but thats also bc i take the preventative measures to have that safety around me. (I carry pepper spray, always go in a group of 3+, always have one of our bfs or guy friends either with us or at least near by if something goes wrong, and i also stay sober to be aware of my surroundings) ik its a lot lmaoo but this world is very dangerous and ive experienced too much from men already.

I guess my own personal view is that she could\u2019ve just not said anything, so perhaps she didn\u2019t realise it would be a big deal. I would hope she would respect OP\u2019s boundaries with that going forward. One person might think this is ok where another might not, and it\u2019s important they discuss what they\u2019re comfortable with. \n\nWith regards to the whole giving guys her number to avoid confrontation, this is definitely a legit thing that many girls go through.

But that doesn\u2019t mean that I should just stop going out to places where this happens? When I was younger I was very shy and non confrontational and, yes, it can actually be extremely difficult to say no to a man. \n\nIt probably sounds ridiculous to someone who has not personally experienced it, I get that. And I agree that doing it for drinks is too far considering OP has voiced his concerns before. Gf is an AH for that, I agree, and I would hope she would not do that again now they have had this talk. I\u2019m just trying to shed some light on the fact that this is something that _many_ women go through and it is not done out of shady motives, rather that giving someone your number as a way to get them off your back and avoid conflict _is_ a thing that happens a lot.", "Ah, you can't take the facts.

English is not my native language so excuse my mistakes. Isn\u2019t it scarier to give out personal details like phone number or instagram where the creepy guys are able to find you at all times and know your name instead of walking away in a bar where you remain anonymous? They might call me a bitch and blunt but at least I am safe when I just walk away into the crowd. I wouldn\u2019t want them to be able to look me up online or have my phone number.. i do understand giving a fake phone number though. I also give a fake name sometimes. Like similar to my name but they can\u2019t find me (Lisa when my name is Linda).", "Except it can be legitimately dangerous for a woman to say no.

It\u2019s more about her intentions, and, from this, it seems like she\u2019s either just avoiding conflict or grabbing some free drinks rather than _wanting_ to speak to anyone. I think it really comes down to whether OP trusts her or not. Does he think she\u2019s going to engage with these people after the fact? Her actions regarding the drinks may have been a bit uncool but almost everyone telling OP she\u2019s cheating and to leave her are being alarmist.", "I would be so uninterested in a guy that tried to call as I will still sanding right there.
