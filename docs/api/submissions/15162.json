Why don't you have joint custody?", "This is tough because you are completely justified in saying what you said to him. And I can completely understand why you said it, and why it was done immediately. I cannot imagine how hurt and upset your daughter was. He deserved to hear that he is entirely in the wrong.\n\nPerhaps the restaurant was not the place to unleash it upon him though? It seems likely that is there concern, rather than what was said? I'm the same situation I would have been so angry that likely everyone else would also hear what an awful father he was as well. And in today's world, that can mean someone has pulled out their phone, gotten it in video, and posted it to Reddit. \nIf that happens, your daughter would have a lovely momento of you forever, and a reminder of what a poor father he is. \n\nRarely do we ever consider these things when our children have been hurt by someone. Remember that you haven't done anything wrong. It just wasn't the greatest place to have done it in. Unless you are totally against this, I suggest giving them an apology for not waiting to chew him out in a more private setting. \n\nCongratulations to your amazing daughter and her team! You have been doing a great job. And it is such a wonderful thing to ensure that she has a good relationship with his parents. I did the same with my daughter, 26f, and while at times it drove me nearly crazy; she has only benefitted from it. It is hard, but you will get there and it will be worth all the effort.", "Yeah unfortunately YTA for causing a scene at the restaurant and you should apologize for to your ex IL's for that AND only for that.

I know people don't like public scenes, but I think you causing a scene was reasonable, considering the ongoing treatment he's been giving her.\n\nNTA.", "How does it work then?", "Thanks for that info.  I love learning about how things are different and other locations than where I am.\n\nIt sounds like he has been ordered to pay as part of your divorce agreement, and therefore he will owe all that back support.\n\nIf that money gets paid, sounds like she's going to have a nice nest egg.", "Yeah op needs to claim it now and then just put it all in an account for her daughter", "Dunno where OP lives, although assuming not the US.\nBut over here, anything to do with child support doesn't require a lawyer. Law is already very clear on how child support works.\nSo a single application by a county officer, with paperwork she would presumably already have or have easy access to, would suffice.\nThen the county officer does all the work for you.\n\nI can imagine this being the same, or at least very similar in other European countries, since they end to compare themselves to one another.", "You file a form with the court and then have a closed hearing with a judge, which you have to take your proof to (which I can provide, as I have been keeping track in case she ever does want to do this) and then he will be allowed to give a defense where if he has any reasonable explanations for why he stopped paying (he doesn\u2019t, as far as I\u2019m aware). It\u2019s likely I will have to answer some questions. It\u2019s not suing, and neither of them will need lawyers, and it will be a quick process as I have prepared the paperwork she\u2019ll need. \n\nThe reason I haven\u2019t claimed for it myself is because I can afford to provide for us and don\u2019t need his help or his money to do so, have been saving for her college tuition if she chooses to go to college since I found out I was pregnant. I feel it should be her choice whether or not she\u2019d like it in the future. It\u2019s not because I can\u2019t be bothered as another commenter suggested, it\u2019s because the money isn\u2019t mine in the first place and it should be wholly paid to her, in her own name, from her father himself and not through me if she chooses it. It\u2019s not a decision I made lightly, or without looking into or without consideration.", "Hahahaha no", "I'm asking just because I have no idea how it works, but the fact that you \"haven\u2019t claimed for it yourself is because you can afford to provide for you and don\u2019t need his help or his money to do so\" be a point against your claim? I know it's her right to have the money and all that, I'm just wondering if this won't get in the way", "This is idiotic and dragging it out. File the claim, put it in an account with both your names for her when she needs it.", "This could completely disqualify her from financial aid for college!  You need to talk to a financial professional about this!!", "And you\u2019re going to make your daughter do all of that? It may not be technically suing but it\u2019s taking her father to court. That\u2019s a heavy thing for anyone, but especially a young person who\u2019s barely an adult. \n\nYou could very well have claimed the money for her and put it in her name. Stop making excuses about \u201coh it\u2019s her money.\u201d This is really something you should be doing for her.", "She or you should really do that. 18y olds always need money for a car or the driving licence or college etc", "No, it won\u2019t play into the decision. As we have already had a signed agreement, it means he legally has to pay whether I made minimum wage or if I was the best paid person in the country. As she will be an adult, my job or financial status won\u2019t be factored in.", "Respectfully, I didn\u2019t ask for your parenting advice or whether you thought it was a smart decision. I asked whether I was in the wrong for what I said at the restaurant. I am a lawyer, I know the process well and wouldn\u2019t have made this decision if I didn\u2019t know how it works, that it would be quick, and that she would be guaranteed to receive everything she\u2019s entitled to.", "I wouldn\u2019t have made this decision if I hadn\u2019t looked into it already, in detail, and didn\u2019t already know the legal processes well. I know at minimum she will have standard financial aid. And I have been saving a significant portion of my salary for almost 15 years to ensure that she will have access to decent finances she needs while in college."]}
