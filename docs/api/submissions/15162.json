I'm the same situation I would have been so angry that likely everyone else would also hear what an awful father he was as well. And in today's world, that can mean someone has pulled out their phone, gotten it in video, and posted it to Reddit. \nIf that happens, your daughter would have a lovely momento of you forever, and a reminder of what a poor father he is. \n\nRarely do we ever consider these things when our children have been hurt by someone. Remember that you haven't done anything wrong. It just wasn't the greatest place to have done it in. Unless you are totally against this, I suggest giving them an apology for not waiting to chew him out in a more private setting. \n\nCongratulations to your amazing daughter and her team! You have been doing a great job. And it is such a wonderful thing to ensure that she has a good relationship with his parents.

And they said he can while she's in jail, but you have to keep him in the same school (a ninety minute drive) and that it likely would traumatize the child.  So he chose not to pursue it and just deal with his son via the phone except for when the mother would allow visits.\n\nNow that his son is he 18 he's come to live with him and he avoids his mother as the boy is now aware of the lengths she went to to abuse the father-son relationship and just how toxic the mom is.\n\nThere are surely bad men/fathers out there (though one wonders why women choose these men to have babies with) but for every dead beat father there's likely a dead beat mother using her own children and the courts to enact revenge against a man that didn't give her what she wanted.

Is *that* what you're spending *my* child support money on?\"), but that's not how the courts see it. Once the money enters the custodial parent's account and mingles with their money it becomes the custodial parent's money, and unless the custodial parent is neglecting the child, neither the courts, the ex, nor the child gets any say in how the custodial parent chooses to spend the money in her account.

An elderly person would usually qualify for Medicare, and an elderly impoverished person would usually qualify for Medicaid. All state government agencies that would provide nursing or medical care for someone bill Medicare and Medicaid, and 80-90% of nursing homes accept Medicaid.

Well done you for raising such a connected and enthusiastic young person - kudos!

You could explain that was NOT your intent, but...\n\nYou were out with them to celebrate wonderful child's accomplishments. Brian was being mean, belittling the accomplishments, and putting child down. Brian made your child, who you love more than life itself, cry on what was supposed to be *a celebration of her*. Brian has been causing pain to child for nearly a decade and you just couldn't take it any more, seeing the pain she was in. It wasn't a great place to do it, but frankly the timing and venue it happened at was entirely due to Brian's behaviour.\n\nDid they actually expect you to shut up and NOT defend beloved child/beloved grandchild? She's in the car crying - What DID they expect you to do? Actually ask them.\n\nBrian has been gaslighting his parents for years.  Considering they've asked you to apologise and have moved the focus to *your* behaviour - he's probably doing it right now. He's saying 'of course l show up, of course l have a good relationship with child, of course l pay child support, what kind of person/parent/man do you think I am, I'm hurt that you take her word over mine' etc etc etc.\n\nHe's probably in the process of poisoning then against you and possibly manipulating them into shutting down child's relationship with grandparents. That way he can play wounded parent, get sympathy, and not have to do jack-sh*t - his favoured circumstance.\n\nYou need to have a sit-down with them. Invite them to your house for coffee and cake (child can be nearby to be asked for confirmation of events, but not straight-up involved in discussion). They need to be told what he's really like and what's really been happening. And you need to ask what he's been telling them.\n\nThey may not want to hear it. It's hard being told you've been fooled for years and someone you love is an horrid parent and a deadbeat dad. That Brian is NOT who they thought he was. If you want child to continue to have grandparents you have to be kind and gentle.

You're sorry that he's misled them - not because that's your responsibility but because they must be struggling. And you're sorry that this might affect their relationship with your child. It's your wish, and child's wish, that they continue with their wonderful relationship.\n\nBut what you're most sorry for is the way Brian has not been the dad your kid deserves.\n\nGood luck!\n\nETA: we know you didn't cause a scene, Brian did, but he's successfully shifted it onto you.\n\nAnd get that child into counselling/therapy.
