Why don't you have joint custody?", "This is tough because you are completely justified in saying what you said to him. And I can completely understand why you said it, and why it was done immediately. I cannot imagine how hurt and upset your daughter was. He deserved to hear that he is entirely in the wrong.\n\nPerhaps the restaurant was not the place to unleash it upon him though? It seems likely that is there concern, rather than what was said? I'm the same situation I would have been so angry that likely everyone else would also hear what an awful father he was as well. And in today's world, that can mean someone has pulled out their phone, gotten it in video, and posted it to Reddit. \nIf that happens, your daughter would have a lovely momento of you forever, and a reminder of what a poor father he is. \n\nRarely do we ever consider these things when our children have been hurt by someone. Remember that you haven't done anything wrong. It just wasn't the greatest place to have done it in. Unless you are totally against this, I suggest giving them an apology for not waiting to chew him out in a more private setting. \n\nCongratulations to your amazing daughter and her team! You have been doing a great job. And it is such a wonderful thing to ensure that she has a good relationship with his parents. I did the same with my daughter, 26f, and while at times it drove me nearly crazy; she has only benefitted from it. It is hard, but you will get there and it will be worth all the effort.", "Yeah unfortunately YTA for causing a scene at the restaurant and you should apologize for to your ex IL's for that AND only for that.

I'm very much not a lawyer and am likely not from the same place as you, so it's a bit of a curiosity thing.", "You literally came here so that strangers will decide if you are an asshole or not. In the case of calling your ex a deabeat, no, you werent the asshole. But in regards to the child support and dumping it all on your traumatized 18yo daughter, yes, you are a huge gapin asshole.", "You just went from NTA for your post to YTA for sounding like an absolutely toxic and annoying person to live with.", "youre definitely an ah god damn", "Not your friend and if she didn\u2019t want unsolicited advice she should\u2019ve stayed off Reddit, friend.", "Fair enough, thanks for the clarification!", "Yeah but wouldn\u2019t it be better to get the money now and invest it in something?  Earn interested?  You may be a lawyer but that doesn\u2019t mean this is a good financial decision.  Not to mention you are willing to put your daughter through this emotion distress down the line.", "people are just telling you to help out your daughter. don't put this burden on her.", "Perfecto \ud83d\udc4c", "This.  Who cares whether it's paid \"directly to\" the daughter?  This sounds like a pride thing about not wanting to take the ex's money, but it's the daughter's money, not OP's.", "Yeah, assuming she\u2019ll just be able to get all the money in a lump sum when she\u2019s 18 is not the greatest idea. Anything can happen in four years, he could wind up broke.", "If he dies before she turns 18, assuming that he doesn\u2019t have a will then she will inherit any assets he has. If he does have a will and it explicitly excludes her, then any outstanding child support he hasn\u2019t paid and the total sum of future payments will be deducted from his estate and be given to me as the custodial parent, which I will of course put into a trust.", "I asked if I was the asshole in a very specific situation. You all love to give unsolicited and unwarranted advice about something you don\u2019t actually know the details of, because you like to think you know what\u2019s best in a situation you have literally no part of. You don\u2019t know where I live, you don\u2019t know what the custody or child support laws are because again you don\u2019t know where I live. You don\u2019t know the legal situations around our divorce and our divorce agreement, you don\u2019t know anything other than an extremely small amount of non specific information provided her. You think you know how these things work where you are, and you think that means they can be applied to everywhere. It cannot. The legal systems are vastly different worldwide, and despite me saying that I am literally a lawyer in my country, demonstrating that I actually did think this all the way through from multiple different angles, am actually directly involved in the situation, you like to think that you\u2019re capable of deciding what\u2019s best in a situation you know almost nothing about and then don\u2019t like when I disagree. \n\nOf course I\u2019m defensive about it. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?", "Okay, buddy.  Still a dick move.", "And I understand that, but they also don\u2019t know the details of our situation, the legal system here, or whether that actually is what is best for her."]}
