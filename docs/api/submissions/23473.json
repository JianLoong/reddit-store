Recently, I came back to my hometown after graduating for college. For a huge mix of reasons, A was my only friend left in my hometown, and took it upon himself to introduce me to the friends he made while I was away which I really appreciated.\n\nNow I\u2019m a proud member of the alphabet mafia, and A\u2019s known for a long time and been relatively cool about it. That being said, we both come from fairly traditional households, and more to the point our hometown is overall pretty conservative. A 2019 census largely held that less than 50% of the population supported gay marriage, if you\u2019re into statistics. In coming out I have lost a couple friends; not just from homophobia, but because I was not necessarily the easiest person to deal with while I was figuring my sexuality out.\n\nAll this to say that when I was introduced to A\u2019s friends, I wasn\u2019t sure what their overall attitudes towards LGBTQ issues were (A never asked them). Thus, I asked A to keep my sexuality quiet while I assessed the situation.\n\nThis went on for a couple weeks and roughly three hangouts before I figured that it would be okay to \u2018come out\u2019. So when we were talking about each other\u2019s types yesterday evening over a couple drinks, I started sharing about my preferences. I noticed at the time that a few were giving A significant looks, and that he seemed a little awkward, but I didn\u2019t pay it any attention at the time.\n\nAfter the hangout on the way home, however, A told me that he felt awkward for being \u201ccaught out in a lie\u201d. Apparently they\u2019d asked A whether I was gay or not, and he\u2019d been noncommittal about it. When I came out, he said he was caught off guard and didn\u2019t appreciate being made to feel like he was lying to his friends. He asked that in the future I let him know when I \u201cintend\u201d to tell people so he can emotionally prepare himself.\n\nI, to put it plainly, found the whole thing absurd. I told him that when and how I come out is often a matter of opportunity and timing, and while I\u2019ll try to tell him when I am comfortable in the future, that \u2018planning\u2019 to come out felt like a rehash of my teenage years I\u2019d rather avoid. \n\nMoreover, I found his awkwardness strange; he was perfectly fine protecting other people\u2019s privacy - divorces, weddings, and other sensitive information that he is fine keeping mum about. I wasn\u2019t sure why this was the dealbreaker for him.\n\nIn any case, we had a minor argument about the whole thing and after sleeping on in I\u2019m  wondering if I was TA. He does have a point - he is lying on my behalf and I shouldn\u2019t be vilifying him for feeling awkward (a normal response to having to keep secrets from people you trust!). That being said, the part of me that is still very much hurt from years of stigma says that he has no right to dictate the when\u2019s and how\u2019s of my intimate life.\n\nThus, I submit myself to the Reddit gods. AITA for forcing my friend to lie about my sexuality on my behalf?\n\n*EDIT:* Sorry I realise I wasn\u2019t clear on what exactly I asked him to do. We had agreed prior that he was not to bring it up, but if someone asked that he would deflect the question. I never asked him to claim that I was straight.\n\nIn addition, I realise that there may be two separate TA issues here: \n\n1) My initial request on keeping mum\n\n2) My response to his request for a heads up. My defence for that is simply that I wasn\u2019t planning to last night, but I was put on the spot in asking for my preference in girls - and I felt too emotionally drained to lie.", "created_utc": 1690710370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dhjye/aita_for_forcing_my_friend_to_lie_about_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sure have the right to share this info when it suits you, if ever.

Next time you openly and suddenly share it.

You are absolutely right, you can keep your sexuality on the DL, HOWEVER it isn\u2019t fair of you to completely dismiss his feelings on it when he is literally the only one in that town who has your back. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to see how you\u2019ve fucked up and apologize. You wrote this like you were trying to convince yourself.\n\nETA: also, if this friend lied to people he has NEVER lied to for you, it makes you a HUGE asshole to blow you off. I\u2019ve straight up told friends,\u201d I won\u2019t lie for you, you better hope I don\u2019t get asked.\u201d Not about that, but tbh, I don\u2019t know that I would!", "LMAO, I've lied plenty of times to cover my friends' sexualities- it is never your role to out someone else without their explicit permission. It's not HIS sexuality being revealed, so he doesn't have the right to out you.

I live in a country which is much more conservative regarding LGBT+ folks than the population in your city. \n\n1. You asking your friend to \"lie\" is not a bad thing because it is for your own privacy and protection. You have every single right to not wanna share this information with just anyone, especially when it might even be dangerous for you to do so. Ive heard of many cases of people coming out as a gay to someone they didnt know well only to have slurs thrown at them, and sometimes even outright violence.\n\n2. You have 0 responsibility to give your friend a heads up for when you wanna come out. Thats your own decision and no one else gets to decide that for you and is owned a heads up.\n\n\n3. Your other friends are a bit weird. Whats their problem exactly ? Why are they upset that your friend didnt tell them about your sexuality, when he has no right to do so ? Why are they that obsessed with that point ? Why should they be upset ? \n\n\nThis is all my opinion OP, but Im basing it on my experience of living in a conservative country and being friend with LGBT+ folks. \n\nI have gay friends. If someone asked me about their sexuality (even if said friend never asked me to tell people they were hetero) I would say no, they are straight or no, I dont know. Thats all they need to know.", "Soft YTA", "NTA  It isn't lying when it's not his story to tell. It's called keeping a confidence.", "NTA at all. I put the \"b\" in LGBT, and no WAY I will EVER come out without making sure it's safe to do so and I live in a progressive area/country. Although most of my friends are mostly queer, it's an UNSPOKEN agreement between all of us, queer or not, to never, ever out someone else in front of new people. \n\nIt's dangerous, it's personal.

You should have never been in a situation where you have to ask people not to discuss your sexual orientation. \n\nI know that isn\u2019t reality in our world right now, but it takes people to makes the changes before it become a normal interaction.", "Thank you for your honesty! Yes that is what he said - that it was the change in narrative that bothered him.\n\nMy confusion is that I never said I wouldn\u2019t come out, but that I would like to get to know them first. In addition, I never told him to tell them I was straight - I in fact advised a \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to say\u201d, or an \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not a conversation I\u2019ve had with him\u201d. To me, it was no different than confiding that I had, say, a medical history to him but appreciating his discretion in the matter. \n\nIn his equal defence, he is not homophobic! He\u2019s a really great guy, and honestly I want to sit down and talk to him and possibly apologise after I\u2019ve settled my thoughts on the matter. It was never him I didn\u2019t trust, but his friends and our stupid, conservative hometown.", "I think he tries! He\u2019s asked multiple times for my perspective on things because he recognises that coming out and being queer are not his lived experience - it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always appreciated.\n\nI also think I\u2019ve been spoiled by the big city, where most of my friends there have been very open and good about discretion. He did say my expectations were something of a culture shock to him haha.", "I think that was in part why my initial response was so dismissive. In my mind it was no different than asking someone not publicise an embarrassing story, or medical history or anything sensitive. Nothing too out of the norm.\n\nIn reflection I do think that that\u2019s reductive, but I think that\u2019s why I got defensive back at him.", ">it wasn't their place to say.\n\nthats literally outing him though?\n\nHis friends next answer would be: so he is gay then, obviously\n\nOP's-Friend: I didn't say that, I just said it's not my place to say\n\nthem: so he's gay\n\nOP's Friend: can't say yes or no to it  \nthem: dude, whats your problem?  \nop's Friend: he should tell you guys himself, it's his right\n\nthem: so he's gay", ">Thus, I asked A to keep my sexuality quiet while I assessed the situation.\n\nOP specifically asked them to lie for him.", "That was my concern. My friend is an athlete in business and finance, fields that stereotypically are pretty conservative sometimes - which is why I wanted to take my time. \n\nWe\u2019ll definitely be able to! Like I said he\u2019s a great guy and our friendship has been through worse, but I did want to ask the internet\u2019s opinion.", "That\u2019s fair! The issue was that this was a spur of the moment decision, but you\u2019re right. I could have timed it better.\n\nThe problem was they asked me about my \u201ctype\u201d and in the moment I made a split second decision that I didn\u2019t want to fudge the answer. Perhaps I should have been more thoughtful.", "Nope nope! NTA - OP did NOT ask the friend to lie, they asked the friend not to share their personal details. Very different. \n\nEveryone has the right to decide when they share their sexuality and with whom, especially in a society that is dangerous to LGBTQ+ people.", "What exactly is he supposed to do though? Because \u201cis your best friend gay\u201d is a question you should be able to answer, and \u201cidk man\u201d is gonna raise some suspicions in a conservative area", "Honestly I don\u2019t think the issue was what I expected him to do? As many comments below have rightly pointed out, once the question is asked there is no reasonable way to dodge it without outright lying - and even then that\u2019s relying on your own skills at acting. A was in an impossible position, and in the\u2026hour(?) since posting I\u2019ve come to have a lot more appreciation for that.\n\nThat being said, I will still probably be talking to him about why he felt so uncomfortable covering on my behalf, as I personally found that the main point of contention. As some others have said below - people cover for people all the time. Sometimes it\u2019s a sister not telling mom that her younger sister is going on a date. Sometimes it\u2019s a serious diagnosis that a wife asks a husband to keep mum about so she can reveal it on her own time. This can be an awkward process, but usually one that falls within accepted bounds of \u201cthings that are not necessarily pleasant but I will do because I care for person in question\u201d. A has done this before, and I\u2019ve kept secrets for A before as well. \n\nSo it\u2019s probably good that I ask why this request made him so uncomfortable, and what I can do to help. I think at the end of the day that\u2019s probably most important.", "Absolutely! I\u2019ve come to have a lot more sympathy for A\u2019s impossible situation after having read the comments.\n\nThat being said, I will caveat that I once again did not ask him to lie. I asked him to keep the information private - the term \u201casking him to lie\u201d was something I\u2019m quoting from A. I specifically told him that if possible, to keep my sexuality from being public and to deflect the question if necessary. He was okay with this when I asked, but I think the reality of it was much more uncomfortable. I\u2019ll be talking to him about this and trying to figure out how to be better going forward in this for sure!", "Yes. I was stating in my comment above how some comparisons OP are making are apples and oranges. Denying you know about someone\u2019s impending divorce is different than this situation. However, trying to hide the fact someone is married is much more comparable. You could be asked straight up if someone is married or gay and those things are facts and much harder to dodge the question or redirect the conversion. If someone asks, is A getting a divorce I could just say: what have you heard? And leave it at that.", "I like this response!", "so what should OP do? he didn\u2019t want to come out which could possibly put him in an incredibly dangerous situation, and the friends asked.", "Sorry I should have clarified - I didn\u2019t ask him to lie, but rather to say exactly as above: \u201cthat\u2019s not my place, ask him\u201d. \n\nHis response was \u201cthat\u2019s basically saying yes so why can\u2019t I say yes?\u201d \n\nIn all honesty I didn\u2019t actually have a good answer for that haha \ud83d\ude05", "Oof maybe! I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve been self absorbed. Definitely something to consider", "If you bothered to read the post you would see that they never asked their friend to lie. The sequel: \"redditor discovers they have a profound comprehension skills deficit.\"", "Congrats on having the reading comprehension of a brick", "Sounds like you have a pretty good friend in A. You two should definitely sit down and talk it out, it\u2019s not worth straining the friendship over this, good friends are hard to come by. I get your worry about the \u201cconservative/ignorant\u201d hometown vibe, but hopefully it\u2019s not as bad anymore as it was for you when you were a teen. Younger generations tend to be a lot more open minded than their older counterparts. And seriously, if people won\u2019t accept you for who you really are then you are better off with no friends than fake friends. And NAH (no assholes here), I think you were just nervous about opening up to new ppl in this area and A just got confused about how to handle his part of the situation and it all just got a little awkward for both of you.", "I think he was caught in a tough place, he didn't want to out you but was asked directly so was kinda forced to lie meaning until you were in a comfortable place to let people. Seems like bad communication on both sides to be honest. A should have told you that he had to lie so you didn't accidently catch him in a lie but there maybe should have been a plan for this scenario, although much easier to say in hindsight. Don't think either of you were being arseholes just a messy situation due to a lack of communication.", "I don\u2019t think it is the same as a medical history. Friends, especially, in groups often discuss relationships and preferences in a way they don\u2019t normally discuss medical history. I think you put him in an awkward position, but I also understand not feeling comfortable coming out right away. I hope you can continue to be friends.", "Yeah I feel like he was understandably embarrassed but he shouldn't have made that your problem. But also like - sometimes as friends we have arguments because feelings get hurt and when it's about something as relatively small as this it's best to just forget who was right or wrong, appreciate the other person's perspective, remember it for the future so you can avoid needlessly hurting feelings, and just move on with your life.", "I am with you here - if the friends brought it up directly then there pretty much isn't any answer short of lying that won't be immediately (and correctly) interpreted as \"he is gay but I'm not going to explicitly say so\".", "But that's not asking someone to lie, his friend could have just said they weren't sure, he didn't have to say he was staight", "Oh I must\u2019ve missed that. My b.", "Uhh,,, yes because people literally kill us for being different?? I would've done the same thing tbh, you have no idea what it's like to be lgbtqiaa+ and be constantly terrified of the fact that someone could beat you or just hate crime you in general if you come out", "Ps- OP- please know that this whole conversation was orchestrated to figure out if you were gay. The friends asked if you were gay when you weren\u2019t around, and then proceeded to have a conversation that would nudge you out. Just keep that in mind as you\u2019re interacting with these people. It might not be nefarious, they might have wanted to give you an opportunity to share so they could show their support! But still, just know that.", "Yea, that's totally understandable. I get the situation, that's it's not terrible. I think the bigger problem is when he asked for the heads up in the future and you refused it.\n\nBut honestly, this situation will probably not come up again.  Or if it does, instead of an entire friend group, it'll be the occasional trickle in of a single person at a time and you already have a solid group to back you.", "Relationships and dating are extremely common topics, especially in mid-20's.  He was asking him to lie.\n\nAnd nobody is pushing for involuntary outing of people who are LGBTQ.  All that's being said is OP should've given his friend a heads up when he was going to reveal they'd been hiding it/lying about it.", "He did ask for him to lie.\n\n\"Hey, is OP gay?\"  Any answer other than \"No.\" is going to open the floor for the rest of the group to move forward  with the likelihood that OP is, an probaby ask more probing questions.  And of course answering an unwavering \"No\" is a lie in the case.\n\nThe honest answer would be \"That's not for me answer\", or \"Ask him.\"  Both of which would have betrayed the intention behind the OPs request.  So the friend lied for the OP, and the OP just off and exposes him as someone who'll lie to his friends when asked a direct question.\n\nOP YTA.", "He was caught between a promise and questioning. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with having the knowledge but then not spilling the beans because it isn't your can of beans to spill. \n\nThe response I suggested wasn't 'idk', it was 'I can't talk about it, talk to them about it'. \n\nIt shows that he cares about his friend enough to let them deal with it on their own terms.", "The thing is that sometimes things can be kept on the downlow because someone does not ask you straight up. I used to cover for my sister all the time by not disclosing but it\u2019s usually easier. If my parents confront me and ask me straight up: what is going on? I just \u201ccrack under pressure\u201d as I am a terrible liar. A is not out there advertising your sexuality. However, if he\u2019s being asked straight up, that\u2019s a harder question to dodge. Also, if someone is getting a divorce, someone may or may not know so pretending you don\u2019t know about someone\u2019s divorce is much easier than pretending you don\u2019t know one of your closest friends\u2019 sexuality. All that to say, you\u2019re comparing apples and oranges a little bit here.", "Yes I\u2019ve had many similar arrangements, that\u2019s why I can imagine an awkward situation. \n\nSo a real story- I was told a secret by my best friend, and we both agreed that (if another person told me) I would pretend that I\u2019m hearing the story for the first time. So I \u2018act surprised\u2019 when someone else tells me and later it turns out that my best friend already told him that I knew. It was apparent that I was pretending to be surprised :) so a weird situation for me and I was just following the agreement. These kind of things happen. Unintentionally, the person suddenly being honest does make the other person look bad. \n\nSo I am sure that no one had any bad intentions here, but you can just have this in mind to understand why it was a bit awkward for your friend, and maybe you can both try to avoid similar misunderstandings/mistakes in the future.", "I think his friend just wants a heads up when OP is going to reveal it.  That's it.  \"Hey, I'm gonna tell our friends I'm actually gay, thanks for covering for me.\"", "Because OP made him look like a liar to his own friends. You never know how they are gonna take it because they could feel like he didn\u2019t think they were good enough people to know. Which is an issue, because I deal with this. I feel disrespected when someone I ask if they are because they say something that brings it up and they say no just to tell me later they were lying. It\u2019s not hate towards them being whatever they are. It\u2019s the hating being lied to, it\u2019s hating that you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good person and wonder what I\u2019ve done personally to you to make you think that. I understand there is a general fear of how people react to it, but I\u2019m not that person.", "I should have read better. I don\u2019t think there is any Ill intent from either of you and I hope you two work it out just fine. I don\u2019t know from experience just from others, so I just want to say I hope that they\u2019re all still friends with you after that conversation but just remember as always that if that was going to change their opinion of you they would have never been good friends to begin with.", "Neither of you are assholes, you are both soft buttholes. \n\n\nYou for not giving him a heads up, but it\u2019s understandable that you didn\u2019t because the conversation happened organically. \n\nHim for being upset that you didn\u2019t give the heads up, but again, it\u2019s understandable because he felt put on the spot. \n\nBoth of you need to acknowledge that you were soft buttholes, and move on, because there\u2019s no malice here. Just miscommunication", "Now I\u2019m a bit confused, did you ask him to redirect or to respond as you stated here? If I were the friend, I\u2019d be happy to go with the quoted response, much easier than changing the course of conversation. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "Oh this made me realise I omitted a serious piece of info. Oh shoot I may have to make a second edit Mods please don\u2019t kill me.\n\nSo the time lapse between them asking him and him covering on my behalf and my coming out was roughly an hour. I was late to the gathering as I was working a late shift. Apparently while I wasn\u2019t there this conversation was being held, and then I came and there just wasn\u2019t time to have a conversation before all this malarky went down.", "That's still a lie.  If his friend knows and says \"I'm not sure\" that is lying. It's just a different lie.", "Yes. Specifically, he asked what he should do if someone asked about my sexuality and if he should be honest. I said that I would prefer if he deflected the question, or instead said something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to say\u201d.\n\nOn hindsight, I think that\u2019s splitting hairs about lying too.", "That\u2019s literally exactly what you\u2019re doing, you either put them or decline to tell", "Yes! That\u2019s what he was asking for.\n\nThe issue was, I think one of the situation? I don\u2019t think I explained the exact circumstance of what happened very well, but in sum they were asking for my type, and why I was still single, and so on. I\u2019d just had a pretty long shift so I made an on-the-spot decision to just come clean that, in hindsight, could definitely have been more delicately handled.", "LGBTQ people's safety isn't an attack on you.   \n\n> I feel disrespected when someone I ask if they are because they say something that brings it up and they say no just to tell me later they were lying.\n\nMaybe the issue is you asking the question.  If someone wants to come out to you, they will, but you don't have a right to know just because you think you're a safe person. If you show you're a safe person who they can trust, they'll tell you.  I don't think someone choosing to not disclose that to you is the same as lying.", "you don\u2019t have to be that person. OP is in a homophobic community as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community and telling anyone could end badly. the more important question is why are the friends asking after only having met him a few times. i understand if you\u2019ve known each other for months but it hasn\u2019t been that long in this instance. it\u2019s a tough situation and it sucks for the friend but it sucks for OP too", "Thank you! No we\u2019ll be okay I have full confidence in that. \n\nI hope so too! The rest of the night passed without incident so here\u2019s hoping that all this is needless woolgathering", "Wait is that not redirecting? I thought saying \u201cit\u2019s not my place to answer\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not a question I thought to ask\u201d is redirecting the question hahaha. \ud83d\ude05", "Than the friend could've said \"it's not my place to tell.\" Or something like that. There are a lot of things he could answer without puting his friend or lying about it, all OP ask is to not out him. If the friend lie is on him.", "Those are not lies! You did not ask the friend to lie, you asked the friend not to share! Different! \n\nWe all have friends that know more about us than others. I have a friend with whom I share all my personal relationship issues with, they would absolutely deflect the question if someone asked them \u201chow\u2019s squeakie\u2019s marriage?\u201d That\u2019s not a lie. \n\nThe issue is that people feel entitled to know other people\u2019s sexualities, but that doesn\u2019t get to be public info if the person doesn\u2019t want it to be. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re feeling guilty about this. You are NTA and it is absolutely your prerogative to share your sexuality or not with whomever you decide.", "Right, so OP is asking that person to lie for him.  And that person is just saying \"When you reveal I've been lying this entire time, can you give me a heads up first?\"\n\nI'm not saying he was wrong to ask him to lie, I'm saying he was wrong to get mad at his friend for wanted a heads up. \n\nIf you're lying for someone for weeks and then they reveal you've been lying the entire time, you'd want to know it was coming as well.", "You could explained it like this to him. \"Sorry I didn't want to caught you off guard. It was an on the spot decision. I really appreciate that you cover for me and didn't tell them something that was private for me\".\n\nNo need to escalate things for no good reason. I would apologies. For me it's just matter if I hurt someone (that I like) and then explain my viewpoint and try to figure shit out.", "To me, that\u2019s more like responding. I actually thought you expected him to avoid the response and gently move to another topic (I mentioned in another comment that I would 100% fail at this :D ).\n\nOkay so seems like you gave him a good option, NAH in my opinion. You are good friends, even if there is some miscommunication.", "Just for awareness, \u201cit\u2019s not my place to tell\u201d about a yes or no question is absolutely obvious that it\u2019s the scandalous answer.\n\nThat would functionally be outing OP.", "Look, if a friend says that about \\*only\\* one person, then everyone is going to know something is up with that person and just build suspicion.  \n\nOP is asking not to be outed.  That's fine.  This necessitates simple lies or extremely obvious and awkward conversations.  If you think it's not then you are deeply misunderstanding human relationships and interactions.\n\nThe friend is simply asking to be told ahead of time when OP plans to reveal their sexuality. That is all.  It is an incredibly simple ask.", "saying that you don't want to share \"wheter friend X is gay\" basically is the same as telling them, he is gay, though?\n\nNobody says: I don't think it's my place to tell you he is straight\" lol", "\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 seems like a mild and appropriate lie, which I would\u2019ve chosen personally, but it looks like OP wanted the friend to redirect the whole conversation. \n\nTbh, it\u2019s not always possible, and especially not for everyone. I\u2019m usually the silent one in a group, and if someone asked me a question and I just avoided the answer and changed it to a different topic, it would\u2019ve been 100% weird and transparent."]}
