Recently, I came back to my hometown after graduating for college. For a huge mix of reasons, A was my only friend left in my hometown, and took it upon himself to introduce me to the friends he made while I was away which I really appreciated.\n\nNow I\u2019m a proud member of the alphabet mafia, and A\u2019s known for a long time and been relatively cool about it. That being said, we both come from fairly traditional households, and more to the point our hometown is overall pretty conservative. A 2019 census largely held that less than 50% of the population supported gay marriage, if you\u2019re into statistics. In coming out I have lost a couple friends; not just from homophobia, but because I was not necessarily the easiest person to deal with while I was figuring my sexuality out.\n\nAll this to say that when I was introduced to A\u2019s friends, I wasn\u2019t sure what their overall attitudes towards LGBTQ issues were (A never asked them). Thus, I asked A to keep my sexuality quiet while I assessed the situation.\n\nThis went on for a couple weeks and roughly three hangouts before I figured that it would be okay to \u2018come out\u2019. So when we were talking about each other\u2019s types yesterday evening over a couple drinks, I started sharing about my preferences. I noticed at the time that a few were giving A significant looks, and that he seemed a little awkward, but I didn\u2019t pay it any attention at the time.\n\nAfter the hangout on the way home, however, A told me that he felt awkward for being \u201ccaught out in a lie\u201d. Apparently they\u2019d asked A whether I was gay or not, and he\u2019d been noncommittal about it. When I came out, he said he was caught off guard and didn\u2019t appreciate being made to feel like he was lying to his friends. He asked that in the future I let him know when I \u201cintend\u201d to tell people so he can emotionally prepare himself.\n\nI, to put it plainly, found the whole thing absurd. I told him that when and how I come out is often a matter of opportunity and timing, and while I\u2019ll try to tell him when I am comfortable in the future, that \u2018planning\u2019 to come out felt like a rehash of my teenage years I\u2019d rather avoid. \n\nMoreover, I found his awkwardness strange; he was perfectly fine protecting other people\u2019s privacy - divorces, weddings, and other sensitive information that he is fine keeping mum about. I wasn\u2019t sure why this was the dealbreaker for him.\n\nIn any case, we had a minor argument about the whole thing and after sleeping on in I\u2019m  wondering if I was TA. He does have a point - he is lying on my behalf and I shouldn\u2019t be vilifying him for feeling awkward (a normal response to having to keep secrets from people you trust!). That being said, the part of me that is still very much hurt from years of stigma says that he has no right to dictate the when\u2019s and how\u2019s of my intimate life.\n\nThus, I submit myself to the Reddit gods. AITA for forcing my friend to lie about my sexuality on my behalf?\n\n*EDIT:* Sorry I realise I wasn\u2019t clear on what exactly I asked him to do. We had agreed prior that he was not to bring it up, but if someone asked that he would deflect the question. I never asked him to claim that I was straight.\n\nIn addition, I realise that there may be two separate TA issues here: \n\n1) My initial request on keeping mum\n\n2) My response to his request for a heads up. My defence for that is simply that I wasn\u2019t planning to last night, but I was put on the spot in asking for my preference in girls - and I felt too emotionally drained to lie.", "created_utc": 1690710370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dhjye/aita_for_forcing_my_friend_to_lie_about_my/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You sure have the right to share this info when it suits you, if ever.

Next time you openly and suddenly share it.

You are absolutely right, you can keep your sexuality on the DL, HOWEVER it isn\u2019t fair of you to completely dismiss his feelings on it when he is literally the only one in that town who has your back. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to see how you\u2019ve fucked up and apologize. You wrote this like you were trying to convince yourself.\n\nETA: also, if this friend lied to people he has NEVER lied to for you, it makes you a HUGE asshole to blow you off. I\u2019ve straight up told friends,\u201d I won\u2019t lie for you, you better hope I don\u2019t get asked.\u201d Not about that, but tbh, I don\u2019t know that I would!", "LMAO, I've lied plenty of times to cover my friends' sexualities- it is never your role to out someone else without their explicit permission. It's not HIS sexuality being revealed, so he doesn't have the right to out you.

I live in a country which is much more conservative regarding LGBT+ folks than the population in your city. \n\n1. You asking your friend to \"lie\" is not a bad thing because it is for your own privacy and protection. You have every single right to not wanna share this information with just anyone, especially when it might even be dangerous for you to do so. Ive heard of many cases of people coming out as a gay to someone they didnt know well only to have slurs thrown at them, and sometimes even outright violence.\n\n2. You have 0 responsibility to give your friend a heads up for when you wanna come out. Thats your own decision and no one else gets to decide that for you and is owned a heads up.\n\n\n3. Your other friends are a bit weird. Whats their problem exactly ? Why are they upset that your friend didnt tell them about your sexuality, when he has no right to do so ? Why are they that obsessed with that point ? Why should they be upset ? \n\n\nThis is all my opinion OP, but Im basing it on my experience of living in a conservative country and being friend with LGBT+ folks. \n\nI have gay friends. If someone asked me about their sexuality (even if said friend never asked me to tell people they were hetero) I would say no, they are straight or no, I dont know. Thats all they need to know.", "Soft YTA", "NTA  It isn't lying when it's not his story to tell. It's called keeping a confidence.", "NTA at all. I put the \"b\" in LGBT, and no WAY I will EVER come out without making sure it's safe to do so and I live in a progressive area/country. Although most of my friends are mostly queer, it's an UNSPOKEN agreement between all of us, queer or not, to never, ever out someone else in front of new people. \n\nIt's dangerous, it's personal.

You should have never been in a situation where you have to ask people not to discuss your sexual orientation. \n\nI know that isn\u2019t reality in our world right now, but it takes people to makes the changes before it become a normal interaction.", "Thank you for your honesty! Yes that is what he said - that it was the change in narrative that bothered him.\n\nMy confusion is that I never said I wouldn\u2019t come out, but that I would like to get to know them first. In addition, I never told him to tell them I was straight - I in fact advised a \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to say\u201d, or an \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not a conversation I\u2019ve had with him\u201d. To me, it was no different than confiding that I had, say, a medical history to him but appreciating his discretion in the matter. \n\nIn his equal defence, he is not homophobic! He\u2019s a really great guy, and honestly I want to sit down and talk to him and possibly apologise after I\u2019ve settled my thoughts on the matter. It was never him I didn\u2019t trust, but his friends and our stupid, conservative hometown.", "I think he tries! He\u2019s asked multiple times for my perspective on things because he recognises that coming out and being queer are not his lived experience - it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always appreciated.\n\nI also think I\u2019ve been spoiled by the big city, where most of my friends there have been very open and good about discretion. He did say my expectations were something of a culture shock to him haha.", "I think that was in part why my initial response was so dismissive. In my mind it was no different than asking someone not publicise an embarrassing story, or medical history or anything sensitive. Nothing too out of the norm.\n\nIn reflection I do think that that\u2019s reductive, but I think that\u2019s why I got defensive back at him.", ">it wasn't their place to say.\n\nthats literally outing him though?\n\nHis friends next answer would be: so he is gay then, obviously\n\nOP's-Friend: I didn't say that, I just said it's not my place to say\n\nthem: so he's gay\n\nOP's Friend: can't say yes or no to it  \nthem: dude, whats your problem?  \nop's Friend: he should tell you guys himself, it's his right\n\nthem: so he's gay", ">Thus, I asked A to keep my sexuality quiet while I assessed the situation.\n\nOP specifically asked them to lie for him.", "That was my concern. My friend is an athlete in business and finance, fields that stereotypically are pretty conservative sometimes - which is why I wanted to take my time. \n\nWe\u2019ll definitely be able to! Like I said he\u2019s a great guy and our friendship has been through worse, but I did want to ask the internet\u2019s opinion.", "That\u2019s fair! The issue was that this was a spur of the moment decision, but you\u2019re right. I could have timed it better.\n\nThe problem was they asked me about my \u201ctype\u201d and in the moment I made a split second decision that I didn\u2019t want to fudge the answer. Perhaps I should have been more thoughtful.", "Nope nope! NTA - OP did NOT ask the friend to lie, they asked the friend not to share their personal details. Very different. \n\nEveryone has the right to decide when they share their sexuality and with whom, especially in a society that is dangerous to LGBTQ+ people.", "What exactly is he supposed to do though? Because \u201cis your best friend gay\u201d is a question you should be able to answer, and \u201cidk man\u201d is gonna raise some suspicions in a conservative area", "Honestly I don\u2019t think the issue was what I expected him to do? As many comments below have rightly pointed out, once the question is asked there is no reasonable way to dodge it without outright lying - and even then that\u2019s relying on your own skills at acting. A was in an impossible position, and in the\u2026hour(?) since posting I\u2019ve come to have a lot more appreciation for that.\n\nThat being said, I will still probably be talking to him about why he felt so uncomfortable covering on my behalf, as I personally found that the main point of contention. As some others have said below - people cover for people all the time. Sometimes it\u2019s a sister not telling mom that her younger sister is going on a date. Sometimes it\u2019s a serious diagnosis that a wife asks a husband to keep mum about so she can reveal it on her own time. This can be an awkward process, but usually one that falls within accepted bounds of \u201cthings that are not necessarily pleasant but I will do because I care for person in question\u201d. A has done this before, and I\u2019ve kept secrets for A before as well. \n\nSo it\u2019s probably good that I ask why this request made him so uncomfortable, and what I can do to help. I think at the end of the day that\u2019s probably most important.", "Absolutely! I\u2019ve come to have a lot more sympathy for A\u2019s impossible situation after having read the comments.\n\nThat being said, I will caveat that I once again did not ask him to lie. I asked him to keep the information private - the term \u201casking him to lie\u201d was something I\u2019m quoting from A. I specifically told him that if possible, to keep my sexuality from being public and to deflect the question if necessary. He was okay with this when I asked, but I think the reality of it was much more uncomfortable. I\u2019ll be talking to him about this and trying to figure out how to be better going forward in this for sure!", "Yes. I was stating in my comment above how some comparisons OP are making are apples and oranges. Denying you know about someone\u2019s impending divorce is different than this situation. However, trying to hide the fact someone is married is much more comparable. You could be asked straight up if someone is married or gay and those things are facts and much harder to dodge the question or redirect the conversion. If someone asks, is A getting a divorce I could just say: what have you heard? And leave it at that.", "I like this response!", "so what should OP do? he didn\u2019t want to come out which could possibly put him in an incredibly dangerous situation, and the friends asked.", "Sorry I should have clarified - I didn\u2019t ask him to lie, but rather to say exactly as above: \u201cthat\u2019s not my place, ask him\u201d. \n\nHis response was \u201cthat\u2019s basically saying yes so why can\u2019t I say yes?\u201d \n\nIn all honesty I didn\u2019t actually have a good answer for that haha \ud83d\ude05", "Oof maybe! I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve been self absorbed. Definitely something to consider", "If you bothered to read the post you would see that they never asked their friend to lie.

You two should definitely sit down and talk it out, it\u2019s not worth straining the friendship over this, good friends are hard to come by. I get your worry about the \u201cconservative/ignorant\u201d hometown vibe, but hopefully it\u2019s not as bad anymore as it was for you when you were a teen. Younger generations tend to be a lot more open minded than their older counterparts. And seriously, if people won\u2019t accept you for who you really are then you are better off with no friends than fake friends. And NAH (no assholes here), I think you were just nervous about opening up to new ppl in this area and A just got confused about how to handle his part of the situation and it all just got a little awkward for both of you.", "I think he was caught in a tough place, he didn't want to out you but was asked directly so was kinda forced to lie meaning until you were in a comfortable place to let people. Seems like bad communication on both sides to be honest. A should have told you that he had to lie so you didn't accidently catch him in a lie but there maybe should have been a plan for this scenario, although much easier to say in hindsight. Don't think either of you were being arseholes just a messy situation due to a lack of communication.", "I don\u2019t think it is the same as a medical history. Friends, especially, in groups often discuss relationships and preferences in a way they don\u2019t normally discuss medical history. I think you put him in an awkward position, but I also understand not feeling comfortable coming out right away. I hope you can continue to be friends.", "Yeah I feel like he was understandably embarrassed but he shouldn't have made that your problem. But also like - sometimes as friends we have arguments because feelings get hurt and when it's about something as relatively small as this it's best to just forget who was right or wrong, appreciate the other person's perspective, remember it for the future so you can avoid needlessly hurting feelings, and just move on with your life.", "I am with you here - if the friends brought it up directly then there pretty much isn't any answer short of lying that won't be immediately (and correctly) interpreted as \"he is gay but I'm not going to explicitly say so\".", "But that's not asking someone to lie, his friend could have just said they weren't sure, he didn't have to say he was staight", "Oh I must\u2019ve missed that. My b.", "Uhh,,, yes because people literally kill us for being different?? I would've done the same thing tbh, you have no idea what it's like to be lgbtqiaa+ and be constantly terrified of the fact that someone could beat you or just hate crime you in general if you come out", "Ps- OP- please know that this whole conversation was orchestrated to figure out if you were gay. The friends asked if you were gay when you weren\u2019t around, and then proceeded to have a conversation that would nudge you out. Just keep that in mind as you\u2019re interacting with these people. It might not be nefarious, they might have wanted to give you an opportunity to share so they could show their support! But still, just know that.", "Yea, that's totally understandable. I get the situation, that's it's not terrible. I think the bigger problem is when he asked for the heads up in the future and you refused it.\n\nBut honestly, this situation will probably not come up again.  Or if it does, instead of an entire friend group, it'll be the occasional trickle in of a single person at a time and you already have a solid group to back you.", "Relationships and dating are extremely common topics, especially in mid-20's.  He was asking him to lie.\n\nAnd nobody is pushing for involuntary outing of people who are LGBTQ.  All that's being said is OP should've given his friend a heads up when he was going to reveal they'd been hiding it/lying about it.", "He did ask for him to lie.\n\n\"Hey, is OP gay?\"  Any answer other than \"No.\" is going to open the floor for the rest of the group to move forward  with the likelihood that OP is, an probaby ask more probing questions.  And of course answering an unwavering \"No\" is a lie in the case.\n\nThe honest answer would be \"That's not for me answer\", or \"Ask him.\"  Both of which would have betrayed the intention behind the OPs request.  So the friend lied for the OP, and the OP just off and exposes him as someone who'll lie to his friends when asked a direct question.\n\nOP YTA.", "He was caught between a promise and questioning. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with having the knowledge but then not spilling the beans because it isn't your can of beans to spill. \n\nThe response I suggested wasn't 'idk', it was 'I can't talk about it, talk to them about it'. \n\nIt shows that he cares about his friend enough to let them deal with it on their own terms.", "The thing is that sometimes things can be kept on the downlow because someone does not ask you straight up. I used to cover for my sister all the time by not disclosing but it\u2019s usually easier. If my parents confront me and ask me straight up: what is going on? I just \u201ccrack under pressure\u201d as I am a terrible liar. A is not out there advertising your sexuality. However, if he\u2019s being asked straight up, that\u2019s a harder question to dodge. Also, if someone is getting a divorce, someone may or may not know so pretending you don\u2019t know about someone\u2019s divorce is much easier than pretending you don\u2019t know one of your closest friends\u2019 sexuality. All that to say, you\u2019re comparing apples and oranges a little bit here.", "Yes I\u2019ve had many similar arrangements, that\u2019s why I can imagine an awkward situation. \n\nSo a real story- I was told a secret by my best friend, and we both agreed that (if another person told me) I would pretend that I\u2019m hearing the story for the first time. So I \u2018act surprised\u2019 when someone else tells me and later it turns out that my best friend already told him that I knew. It was apparent that I was pretending to be surprised :) so a weird situation for me and I was just following the agreement. These kind of things happen. Unintentionally, the person suddenly being honest does make the other person look bad. \n\nSo I am sure that no one had any bad intentions here, but you can just have this in mind to understand why it was a bit awkward for your friend, and maybe you can both try to avoid similar misunderstandings/mistakes in the future.", "I think his friend just wants a heads up when OP is going to reveal it.  That's it.  \"Hey, I'm gonna tell our friends I'm actually gay, thanks for covering for me.\"", "Because OP made him look like a liar to his own friends. You never know how they are gonna take it because they could feel like he didn\u2019t think they were good enough people to know. Which is an issue, because I deal with this. I feel disrespected when someone I ask if they are because they say something that brings it up and they say no just to tell me later they were lying. It\u2019s not hate towards them being whatever they are. It\u2019s the hating being lied to, it\u2019s hating that you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good person and wonder what I\u2019ve done personally to you to make you think that.

Just miscommunication", "Now I\u2019m a bit confused, did you ask him to redirect or to respond as you stated here?

Oh shoot I may have to make a second edit Mods please don\u2019t kill me.\n\nSo the time lapse between them asking him and him covering on my behalf and my coming out was roughly an hour.

I think keeping him in the loop on your comfort-level would have mitigated his unease in this situation. Not that you would have known exactly when you were going to share, as it was spontaneous, but only that the likelihood was higher after some time so he wouldn\u2019t have been caught completely off-guard.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t say this to be flippant; I myself am a gay man and I have throughout my life asked friends and family members to be discreet and secretive and deflective for me while I was figuring out my sexuality and, later, while I was assessing the trustability of new acquaintances. But I always tried to keep them in the loop on my comfort-levels as best as possible.\n\nI think, from his perspective, he probably didn\u2019t think anything of it (we can call that straight privilege, if we want), but when you made it a point to be protective, that put him on the spot to help you remain protected until you were ready to lower your guard. So I think, for his benefit, it would have been best to inform him that you were gaining trust in these new friends and, thus, more willing at some point to share your sexuality.\n\nHowever, I want to point out that, given the fact they were asking him about that, they likely had a suspicion and wanted to know. Since you asked him to deflect (which is your right to ask that of him and he has proven himself as a good friend by deflecting their questions), I bet they either dropped it or weren\u2019t satisfied by his answers. Queue the conversation brought up about what preferences everyone has in girls. I\u2019d bet cash-money that this conversation was brought up specifically to find out your sexuality.\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of a double issue here: they found out your sexuality, which is well within your right to share when and how, and then they also found out that he covered the truth from them, which probably put them a little off regarding A\u2019s trustworthiness in their eyes.\n\nSo again (sorry for long reply), I think if you had been a bit more communicative with A, so as to let him know you were warming up to the friends and would thus be more likely to share your sexuality with them, he likely would have been better prepared for them finding out that he hadn\u2019t been straightforward with them.\n\nIn the end, I hope you and A work it out, and hopefully this is a situation that paves the way for a more communicative friendship between you two, as well as the other friends, and hopefully they will understand the situation with a little time and context.

I knew my best friend in highschool was queer but had to hide it from our friends and her parents, which put me in an awkward spot (especially because we had a thing going on and I couldn't talk to anyone about it). Being asked about it can really put them on the spot, and to my understanding it doesn't seem like you and A talked about how they'd approach the conversation if their friends inquired about your sexuality.

But i understand why he's upset, and i think it would have helped to say something like \"I'm not always comfortable enough around new people to share something that personal, so I've told A in the past to deflect if people ask.\" That way no one gets up his ass about \"lying,\" and he feels recognized for his allyship. Which is something that should be recognized! I'm not LGBTQ but am a racial minority, but i think the same dynamic applies here--just because someone is more privileged doesn't mean that being an ally comes without sacrifice. Those sacrifices might look small to us, but they still require a mental/emotional burden, and \"coming out\" as an ally can be scary (or even dangerous) too. Of course, you don't owe him recognition or anything like that, but sometimes our allies do need to hear why/how their efforts help. And that's why I think a \"A is a good guy and wanted me to feel welcome, which i now do!\" is really valuable--not just for A's friends to recognize that he wasn't being misleading because he didn't trust them, but also for A to really see how what he did helped you feel safe enough to come out to his friends, and that's huge.", "I think you unintentionally put him in a tough spot though.

Stop asking people if they\u2019re gay.", ">Because OP made him look like a liar to his own friends.\n\nNo. OP's friend didn't have to lie, the friend was just clumsy about it. Sucks for the friend but not OPs fault.", "Sure. It doesn\u2019t seem that the friend had a problem with keeping the info private. But he probably pretended he didn\u2019t know and Op turned around and then disclosed the info like it was common knowledge. I get why the friend is in an awkward position.", "Yeah I could see him being very thrown off and uncomfortable. He tells his friends one thing, to respect your wishes, and then an hour later you pull the rug out from under him.  It sounds like it was unavoidable and you were both doing your best, so I'd say NAH", "Still, I agree with the above post on communication breakdown and just the fact it was the situation.  Also, he could be la bad liar. Anyway, no assholes here, talk to your friend and work it out. No sense in losing a good friend.  Good luck!", "You should apologize to him gor changng the narrative so abruptly and tell the friends you had asked him to keep it quiet. Otherwise they might start thinking *he* was the one uncomfortable with your sexuality.", "You Speedy Gonzales'ed out the closet after he spent like all day trying to figure out how to cover for you. \n\nBuy this poor man a beer and let everyone know you asked him to cover for you because you wanted to be the one to tell them.", "Let's be honest, a \"Is *** gay?\" is a yes/no question and almost every other answers is a Yes.\nThe only answer i can come up with is \"it's none of my business\" but can sound weird if you know each other for long time as close friend, especially if they are childhood friends. Maybe a \"Not as far as I know\" can make the trick.\nPlayful comment like \" Idk are you interested?\" Or shit like that are a one time trick. If they got it twice as a group, it is already suspicious.", "Exactly. In a small town, if someone catches a vibe that someone's not straight, they're going to ask their friend about it. And not in a delicate, respectful way", "Are they uncomfortable with \"straightness\"? \nSounds like a discomfort in their sexuality.... Huh. \n*.* Science.", "What in earth is the difference in this context?  In response to asking if someone\u2019s gay he\u2019s supposed to talk about the weather?", "It literally says in the post \u201c he does have a point he\u2019s lying on my behalf\u201d. So whatcha got now?", "You need to face reality", "A would *not* be outing them.  How exactly is A outing them by saying \"Please tell me before you tell them\"?", "This is the core issue. I have found though that the conservative people from where I\u2019m from are the ones who ask about your sexuality and need confirmation that you are straight. Either cause all they think about is getting girls or they don\u2019t want to be associated with anyone LGBTQ+. I live in NYC now and it\u2019s not something we ever ask. It is just revealed naturally in the course of talking about dating or whoever you are going on vacation with. But part of that is that people can be open about it here. No one I am friends with has a need to know or thinks it\u2019s their right to ask because it\u2019s important to them.", "OP tells friend to not let any of his friends know I\u2019m whatever. That means if they ask say no. If you say idk it leaves it up in the air. That\u2019s why the friend lied.", "\"He's never sucked my dick, but shoot your shot I guess buddy.\" is about as close to a noncommittal answer as you can get in a small town when it comes to trying to beard a gay guy. \n\nIf you don't turn it back on the other person in a playful way, it's 100% a confirmation, *BUT* it can also come off like you're being rude to your friend, if said friendship is not a banter battalion.", "Saying \u201cask OP\u201d is not lying. It\u2019s keeping OP\u2019s secret and ending the conversation.", "As a gay person, I absolutely want and expect my friends to lie for me about this if it comes up when I\u2019m in a group of people I don\u2019t know. They will without question because they understand the social and possible physical risks of the wrong person knowing. Lying is not always bad.", " Do you not know any members of the alphabet mafia? Some people just make a general announcement. Some like it to come up naturally in conversation.  OP sounds like the type that wants it to come up naturally.  So, what do you suggest? OP come up with a list of topics prior to going out?", "Which will be interpreted as \"yes, he is but I'm not gonna straight up say yes\"", "And what I\u2019m saying, is that you don\u2019t get what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m not just asking my friends out the blue if they are whatever they are. I only ask if it is relevant to the conversation. That\u2019s called being rude and you aren\u2019t supposed to do that. What I\u2019m talking about is if it is relevant to the conversation and I ask mostly to clarify what they said, I could just put an ask but that\u2019s tactless and so am I. I could also ask by just saying let me see them if they bring up a new partner or whatever. But I\u2019ve had someone talk to me about their boyfriend, it was a male, once. So I honestly said didn\u2019t know they had one, and he responded with, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t have one I just wanted to make sure you were paying attention.\u201d Just for him to tell me a month later. That right there is what I am talking about. What I have been talking about. Respect goes both ways. We are friends, respect me enough to not lie to my face, and respect me enough to not make me out to be a liar. I stopped speaking with him after that because there was no reason to lie to me like that. Forgot to add this but we have had previous conversations on the subject, this was back when Obama first made legal to get married and it came up which I had no issues with. But I understand how the friend feels. Not because of the situations are similar, but because I know how it feels to hate lying. And that\u2019s what his friend made him do. He was under the impression he wasn\u2019t going to tell them. But he did. Now he\u2019s a liar. Close friends remember that shit. It would\u2019ve been different if he told them to ask OP but OP said not to tell anyone, which means not to give anyone the ability to assume he is something, so he couldn\u2019t do that. He is a good friend for doing what OP said to, but he is shitty he was made into a liar.", "\"I don't know\", would be a lie as well. But saying, \"Ask OP himself\", would be a perfectly acceptable answer.", "It\u2019s still ridiculous for OP to then change the narrative at a whim and be confused as to why the person who he asked to maintain it now has to suddenly switch and is uncomfortable with that.", "Lol no, it's not gonna accomplish either", "You are either hopelessly naive or just being ridiculous. These people aren't stupid, they can see through dumb shit like this easily.\n\nAny answer other than \"no\" means \"yes, he is gay\" to them. You cannot deflect your way out of this one.", "That when OP thinks they're feeling comfortable enough they just tell their friend \"Hey, I think I'm comfortable enough to let them know sometime soon, but let me tell them.\"", "But he said not to tell them. That means don\u2019t give them any ideas about it. Nothing.", "Maybe OP decided right at that minute he was comfortable enough to come out. Was he supposed to stop the conversation to let A know he was gonna come out?"]}
