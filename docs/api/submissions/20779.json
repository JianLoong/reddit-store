But she kept doing it &started pushing about how it wasn't \"fair\" because she couldn't have people over. which was completely crazy to me, I wasn't having parties. My boyfriend was here all the time so I wouldn't have to sit around in fking diapers. It's not the same. &I told her that. But she wanted to pick a fight while I was trapped in bed.\n\nMy boyfriend came into her arguing with me a couple weeks ago &he got pissed &told her to leave me alone. They went into the living room to argue so I don't know exactly how it went but it upset her because the next day, she bolted the door and refused to let my mom in. Mom called me from outside so I called Joy &told her she had to let her in, she had a med refill that I needed &she was literally putting me in danger by refusing. She still wouldn't open the door so I called the police from my bed &told them that she was holding me in my home &interfering with my medical needs. They came out &took a report; I didn't ask about pressing charges at that time because I felt guilty my illness caused the situation in the 1st place. \n\nThe next day, I told her that I would be evicting her in 30 days. And she laughed at me and told me no, her lease ended in 4 months, there was nothing I could do about it & this is what I got for being a hypocrite.\n\nI spent 2 days on the phone with a million different people &between the police incident & my landlord's help, I was able to get an emergency (24hr) eviction order. She didn't have time to find a new situation &I know she was low on money so from what I hear, she's been sleeping in her car in between crashing on couches.\n\nI felt fine about it but what made me question myself is when I was relaying the whole thing to another friend who doesn't even know her &she was like, \"that's cold. you really just put a woman out on the street alone?\" &I defended my choice.

A friend wouldn\u2019t instantly take an inconsiderate strangers side after the stranger literally interfered with your recovery.", "Nta. \n\nA\nShe played stupid games and won stupid prizes.  \nB. \nShe can't see the diffrence between party ppl and i need help wiping my butt ppl.\nC.\nShe sounds like she was gonna be a brat the last 4 months.  \n\nZ. \nShe was subletting. She tried to bully you while you were vulnerable. Forcing you to call the cops.  She is the hypocrite. \n\nNta", "NTA. She was unreasonable in comparing her situation (wanted friends to hang with all the time) and yours (needed care for a medical issue). And she was wildly out of line in barring your mother from the flat and causing you to have to call the police. That is very unbalanced behaviour and she made you unsafe. You were 100% right to kick her out.", "OP's friend can offer the former roommate to move in with her then.", "Even complaining about having people over - when somebody has medical need it's different. The worst it should have been is *potentially* mentioning that once OP was better, she expected it to go back to 2 nights a week, but even then, what human being doesn't see the difference between a boyfriend giving medical care and friends/partners just staying over all the time? \n\n*Maybe* OP could have used the legal route to evict her in 30 days, but then she's dealing with somebody angry and potentially vindictive for 30 days. I don't want anybody sleeping in cars, but she locked out important medical care, which, in my opinion, is worse than forcing her to sleep on couches until she finds somewhere new.", "A judge ruled there were grounds for a 24 hour eviction! That\u2019s serious. Her actions made that situation. NTA", "She put op in danger and basically hold op hostage as op was unable to move on her own. NTA", "How do you consult someone before hand about a emergency surgery? And how exactly do you go about that if the roommate isn\u2019t alright with it?

From a certain angle that could be construed as kidnapping or imprisonment, and it certainly could be seen as a direct attempt to intimidate and coerce OP.\n\nTheres a whole sinister second layer to the whole thing *on top of* the medical risk that even on its own would be perfectly reasonable cause to be seriously uneasy about sharing a living space with them.\n\nAnyone who gatekeeps access and support for a medically incapacitated person has some serious Misery vibes and I know I'd feel unsafe in that situation. OP handled it well. This woman was a tennant and had rights but she also made herself a clear threat to OP's safety in response to a minor grievance. Safety comes before compassion, especially considering OP probably could very realistically attempt to press criminal charges in these circumstances. An emergency eviction is probably a pretty mild outcome for the tennant all things considered."]}
