It was a bit rough at first because Joy loved having people over all the time. After awhile of her people being there 5/6 days a week, I talked to her and we set some rules for visitors, for both of us - 2 days a week. It's been about 8 months and things had been mostly good.\n\nI had emergency major surgery in mid May &spent 10 days in the hospital. I'm doing somewhat better now but I couldn't care for myself at all at first. I couldn't get to the bathroom on my own or go to the kitchen to get myself food so I was 100% dependent on my boyfriend& my mom. My boyfriend stayed over almost every night & my mom would come over often to help me.\n\nafter the first week, Joy started coming into my room and complaining about people being over so much. I did feel bad when she brought it up because I hadn't considered her so I apologized for it being stressful &that we'd be back to normal as soon as I could manage it. But she kept doing it &started pushing about how it wasn't \"fair\" because she couldn't have people over. which was completely crazy to me, I wasn't having parties. My boyfriend was here all the time so I wouldn't have to sit around in fking diapers. It's not the same. &I told her that. But she wanted to pick a fight while I was trapped in bed.\n\nMy boyfriend came into her arguing with me a couple weeks ago &he got pissed &told her to leave me alone. They went into the living room to argue so I don't know exactly how it went but it upset her because the next day, she bolted the door and refused to let my mom in. Mom called me from outside so I called Joy &told her she had to let her in, she had a med refill that I needed &she was literally putting me in danger by refusing. She still wouldn't open the door so I called the police from my bed &told them that she was holding me in my home &interfering with my medical needs. They came out &took a report; I didn't ask about pressing charges at that time because I felt guilty my illness caused the situation in the 1st place. \n\nThe next day, I told her that I would be evicting her in 30 days. And she laughed at me and told me no, her lease ended in 4 months, there was nothing I could do about it & this is what I got for being a hypocrite.\n\nI spent 2 days on the phone with a million different people &between the police incident & my landlord's help, I was able to get an emergency (24hr) eviction order. She didn't have time to find a new situation &I know she was low on money so from what I hear, she's been sleeping in her car in between crashing on couches.\n\nI felt fine about it but what made me question myself is when I was relaying the whole thing to another friend who doesn't even know her &she was like, \"that's cold. you really just put a woman out on the street alone?\" &I defended my choice. And she got really angry with me &told me I know what happens to women in those situations &I should be ashamed of myself.

She went too far when she refused to let your mother deliver your medicine. You had every right to call the cops and to evict her. Yes, it's not good to evict people who don't have places to go, but she put you in danger with her petty behavior. \n\nTo be honest, this story should've ended when you told her that having medical help is different than just hanging out. The fact that she continued to complain just shows that she doesn't care.", "and you're supposed to let her keep living in your house while you're bedridden? NO. she needs help but she's not your responsibility. if she had a healthy mental state and control over her own actions, she'd still have a place to live. NTA.", "NTA. she put you in *danger*. she did this to herself and you had every right to evict her.", "NTA- Like not even close to questionable. This lady was a literal nut job that put you in danger. And if your other friend can\u2019t grasp that, cut her out ASAP too I promise that you\u2019ll be way happier for it.", "NTA. Your health and wellbeing comes first. \nYour home. You weren\u2019t having friends over. You were having carers over. \n\nScrew her for forcing you to call the police", "NTA. If what you say is true, your medical issue is bad enough that you cannot even get out of bed without help, then she is very lucky you didn't press charges. \n\nAny problems she has beyond that are her own doing.", "NTA- She was making problems over you having two people over to help you recover from major surgery to her having a lot of people over for a party. Then put you at risk by not letting you mom in with medication that you needed. If she didn't want to get kicked out then she should have been a decent human being instead of another dumpster fire.", "NTA. \n\nThe moment you had to call the police the post should have ended. She either has mental issues or a full-fledged narcissist. Doesn't matter which one, because eventually she would have hurt you in a worse way. Still can't imagine what was going through her head.

Not the mark of a good person, she made her bed, and now she doesn't get to lie in it lol - NTA", "NTA. The difference between her having peeps over every day & you needing medical/physical help are completely different. Locking your mom out when she had your meds was both stupid & dangerous. She has no one to blame but herself after her crazy stunt.", "NTA - this wound up being not a safe situation for you. You had no choice.", "NTA. She got what she deserved.  The friend that's telling you you're wrong is full of it. Joy is an awful person.  She obviously lacks empathy since she didn't care for your well-being.  The nerve of her to take advantage of your generosity of letting her live with you. You got rid of a very toxic person.  You should consider getting rid of another toxic person... the one telling you that you're wrong. \nI hope you are recovering well. Take care of yourself.", "NTA\n\nAlso, the friend who\u2019s on your ex-roommate\u2019s side? Is an ex-friend.

A real, proven danger.\n\nWeighed against a possible, unknown danger to her, the choice is obvious.", "NTA", "NTA... its cold but justifyably so... she was delulu, cant treat medical aid as the same as having guests, and she was getting irrational and dangerous. You being in a vulnerable position make an emergency eviction justifiable.\n\nShe can sleep in the bed she made..out on the street.", "NTA.

After all, she was just a friend of a friend when she moved into your place.", "NTA\n\nShe did not pick this fight wisely at all. There is a crystal clear difference between having many different people over socially six nights a week, and having two people support you through a health crisis. \n\nYou even apologised once she pointed out it was affecting her which was very classy of you but for the record I think she was just finding a petty fault in there somewhere because you had your boyfriend over so much and she didn\u2019t. She was wilfully indulging in her own petulance by choosing to see it as you \u2018having people over\u2019 rather than \u2018your support network are assisting you through recovery\u2019 \n\nIf she\u2019d used her actual brain, had she lifted a finger to help you herself then your mum would not have had to check in so often and boyfriend might have spent less time in the apartment too.", "NTA if you had to involve the police because she would not allow people into the house to help you in an emergency situation. That is an issue. You were not having parties. You are not just hanging out having fun in between whatever else it is you do. This situation suck for her? Yes, it does but she created that situation herself.", "She put your life at risk when she refused to let your mother in. She was throwing a tantrum and it threatened your life. She is immature and careless, having zero concern for a person healing up from surgery. Maybe, just maybe, she might learn to lower her entitlement when she is staying in someone else's home. She made a choice and is now reaping the \"benefits\" of her decisions. NTA.", "NTA, I'm sorry but you have to put your safety over hers. bedridden and she locked you inside without help, and wouldn't let you medicine or aid in, out of spite. \n\nThat was a dangerous and a ridiculously petty overreaction, if she can do that and feel 0 remorse over an argument than it is no longer safe to have her in your home. \n\nIt takes a special kind of stupid and entitled to equate having friends over/parties with having what was basically a home health Aide over. Your BF want over for a social call, he was your nurse. \n\nTell your friend if she's so concerned than she can go find her and let her stay with her.", "NTA, but with ESH undertones.\n\nYou should have consulted with her beforehand...even though you are laid up and the primary on the lease, it was a mutual agreement YOU initiated in the first place.  You should have been ahead of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, she took the major AH road over it.\n\nYou were right to give her the boot when she took it the way she did, but the situation could have been avoided if you had considered her in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
