For the entirety of her living here she has been pretty rude to my husband and I've tried to talk to her about it once, it seemed to just have gotten worse.\nFlash forward to a few weeks ago she broke two sentimental cups so I send her a text asking her to be more careful with what she puts in the dishwasher. She blows up so I asked her if we could sit down and talk about it later because she was making me mad and I didn't want to say anything that I would regret. So Tuesday comes and she comes and sits next to me and continuously tries to start the conversation. I tell her we will wait until Thursday because that's when we planned on talking about it, because I still needed time to think about what I wanted to say. She wouldn't drop it so I start explaining as politely as possible the things that have bothered me and my husband. From the start she had been raising her voice and talking over me, while I was completely calm. The conversation went on for about an hour until my husband came out and told her she has until March 31st (which is over 70 days, she's not even on our lease) to get her stuff and move out. She says she'll be gone by the end of the week. She then tells me that all of my stress is made up and in my head, and that my 8 month old baby is \"disrespectful\" for screaming when she's trying to sleep and I should just keep him in our room until she wakes up (she wakes up at 5pm, our baby wakes up at 7am and she doesn't get home until 8am). After she continues to say disrespectful things I tell her she needs to leave for the night. I tell her I won't sit here and let her talk down on my child who is communicating in the only way he knows and I won't keep him trapped in a small room all day because that's cruel. While packing her things she throws his high chair on the ground.\nWe find out like two days later that she contacted the CPS worker that takes care of my safety plan (mental health crisis, it's just a law that CPS has to get involved here when stuff like my admission happens) and files a false report that we are being neglectful and abusive. Our caseworker comes and does a skin check and house check. While I was walking our caseworker down roommate was taking her furniture and tries to leave without giving me the keyfob to our apartment. She throws it at me and drives off.\nAfter she has fully moved out and we've cut all reasons for contact we explain to family that if she is around them they will not see baby. We've been told twice now by separate people that we are being dramatic and it's unfair that they don't get to see the baby when they want. We don't believe in the \"it's my child so I own them\" type of parenting but we are putting our foot down to keep abusive people out of his life.\n\nEdit to add: She is dating my husband's cousin. That's the only reason she would be around his family.", "created_utc": 1674526193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10juflx/aita_for_telling_family_they_cant_see_baby_if_she/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Umm\u2026yeah, NTA. And anyone who says you are overreacting can house her and they will be on the same NC list.

Don't feel badly about setting a boundary with family that this woman can't be around your baby. They can choose the volatile woman or the baby. I know who I would choose! Babies are not novelty items to get to be seen whenever and with whoever your family wants. Protect your tiny human because it sounds like no one else in your family will.", "NTA.  This woman is a threat to baby, and you and your husband.  Your rule is necessary.", "NTA - She's trying to bully you.

Be the \"it's my child so I own them\" type of parents, because it IS your child and it's YOUR right to determine who gets to see them and when.\n\n>it's unfair that they don't get to see the baby when they want\n\nThis is why I've said to be the \"my child\" type of parents. NO ONE save for you and your husband (and CPS in the event of reports) should have free rein to seeing your child. What if they were to have the dreaded C and don't care that they can infect your child with it but come to see him? You should have the right to deny them the visit even though it's when \"they want\". I would recommend you look into the various legal things you may be able to go ahead and do to protect yourself, your husband, and your child (restraining orders top that list). Ex-roommate has already shown some violent tendencies towards you and your immediate family (throwing the apartment key fob at you, throwing the high chair to the ground), and her eviction may push her towards greater violence. Document EVERYTHING involving her and your immediate family to have it ready in the event things escalate and you have to go the legal route. Also talk to your CPS caseworker about these violent events, that she has already made the one false report, and you are concerned that she or your extended family will begin escalating in retaliation to you cutting the extended family off from your son so long as she is around, and that you've already had some of them complain to you that they won't get to see him whenever they want anymore. Even better if those couple of complaints so far were by email/text, so that you can actually show the caseworker the statements. Your caseworker can likely put a flag in the file that there is already a history of false reporting (albeit only once so far) against you, and that will likely help prevent your son's removal form your household during investigations if more false reports come in. Or, in the event they DO have to remove your son from the household during investigations in the future, he won't  end up with those family members but with people who will at least respect your wishes that she not be anywhere near your son and that people don't just have free reign to your child.", " NTA at all your child is a priority and quite frankly any psycho that has the audacity to complain about a baby screaming and throwing said babies high chair needs to be far away from any child if your family can\u2019t respect that they don\u2019t need to be around your child either", "My head hurts trying to read through this.", "Stay firm. She was rude, violent, and filed a false report against you.

When I say we don't believe in the \"it's my child so I own them\" I meant more so for when it could become harmful when he's a bit older, definitely not in this scenario with setting boundaries!

The cameras are great ideas, and I get you can't change the locks, but talk to your landlord. You may be able to add something to the door, such as a lock bar (or something like that? never had to deal with a problem like this so I don't know technical names to things) to prevent her or anyone else from trying to come in again if she had made copies of the keys. Working with the landlord, or property management, may get you some help because they don't want any avoidable damage to their property either or have a reputation for theft at their property. Something else you could (and should) do on your own is to document EVERYTHING you own with descriptions and serial numbers. Take pictures and video for visual references as well. This is a good idea regardless of reasons, because should you need to file an insurance claim for damage, or something gets stolen, you have a description so that the insurance can help replace the item.", "Ok then I say you are NTA\n\nShe sounds crazy, I wouldn't want her around my kid either.  \n\nGood Riddence to her \ud83e\udd17", "Nope!
