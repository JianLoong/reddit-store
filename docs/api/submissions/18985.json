But that steak was 190 bucks! There's no way they budgeted 190+tax and tip for a movie - they're just trying to make OP feel bad for not wanting to pay for the equivalent of two extra meals!", "If money was tight, BIL shouldn't have been an AH and goaded her by saying she was trying to cheap out buy not buying the huge meal.  She was paying for 8 people and he says shes cheaping out for not wanting a KID to order 3lbs of steak.", "THIS!!! OP paid for 6 people - SIX! That is a huge treat and expense even without factoring in the $190 for one person. That means sister and BIL are huge AHs for thinking treating six people is no big deal AND then being okay with son ordering $190 item. And they call OP cheap??? Someone who is paying for six people? And then sister complains that the cost is coming out of their movie budget? So they have to save up to do something as a family but OP should be hunky dory with spending hundreds of dollars to take them all out to dinner: one person paying for seven.\n\nOP: don't ever treat them again!", "I don\u2019t think BIL really assumed his 15yo would eat it all. He underestimated OP\u2019s willingness to follow through on making him pay.", "Yeah I usually get them to order before me and then aim for the same price", "Unless it is something you would normally order but the host would probably know that beforehand anyway.

Not the cheapest thing but stay away from the higher end of the menu too. For drinks I\u2019ll usually stick with water unless they suggest a drink or order something pricey/fancy and then I\u2019ll go a bit under them.", "Honestly, you should pick what you\u2019d eat yourself if you were at home. Do you normally pick a quarter of a cow for one dinner? If no (It would be no for any reasonable person) then you don\u2019t order it.", "I was, at most, 16/17 at the time and I had WANTED to order the seafood pasta because I love seafood but couldn't fathom ordering something that expensive on someone else's dime. I would have offered to take it in a second but it was already such an awkward situation and my dad and her would have taken it as an insult at worst or, at best, piggy greed on my part.", "Omg I just remembered sorry this was like 15 years ago): it was because no one had asked to see her and my dad's wedding album....that none of us knew existed.\n\nThey had gotten married a few months before - it was a surprise wedding in their backyard.

And it wouldn't have been an issue if she had not wasted literally all but two bites", "I understand it is $190.00 for the whole experience, not just tickets, but still, that is ridiculous for 4 tickets and some drinks with popcorn and snacks.", "I eat steak like you do, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves here.

Trying to make OP look bad.\n\nNTA.", "190$ worth!", ">  it was a plan to get food for the family in the form of leftovers\n\nI mean, maybe, but then why agree to pay for it? OP clearly agreed with BIL that BIL would pay for it. If BIL was just trying to save money, he could have backed down when the server warned him, and gotten all the meals paid for. Instead, he gets a stiff bill for overpriced food.", "Yeah, but you're probably right.", "I'd bet you're right. And they're teaching their kids to be manipulative, selfish assholes too. OP was very smart and definitely NTA.", "This. My in-laws shouted us dinner last month when we all went out and my daughter, sister-in-law and I shared the taco platter. It was $90, but if all three of us had ordered our own meals they started at $37. We actually SAVED them money \ud83d\ude02", "It's $190 for the steak and sides, but at a steak house you'll be lucky for most decent steaks on their own to be less than $50. \n\nSo they might have ended up paying *slightly* more than 3 separate meals, but it's at least arguable to do. $190 for a single 15yo's meal is...nah", "Personally with my friends (and my family but less so) I let them know what roughly the budget is per person, or I ask for the same. I'm a picky eater, so sometimes we'll go to a place I know everyone enjoys, and the only thing I enjoy on the menu is dirt cheap. I don't expect anyone to have to stick to the lowest cost item because of my taste, so I devoloped the habit of just saying \"my budget is 'this much' per person tonight, split that between drinks and food as you please\". It just creates a much more direct and easy line they have, and they don't have to feel guilty about ordering something. Sometimes I've had couples who end up essentially pooling their cost together, one doesn't want an expensive dish, so the other can get something a little beyond the line and it evens out. It also creates a dynamic of being open with the table if you want something more indulgent, \"what's everyone thinking of getting, I've never tried 'item' but it's a ways above the budget.\" then if a few people planned on something much cheaper, I can give the go ahead for them to try the new thing.\n\nI don't know, might seem taboo to talk money at the dinner table, but it's almost made more sense to be direct instead of vague so everyone is on the same page.", "Exactly. It should be in the same range.", "Sometimes you WANT those people to have a nice treat though...", "Ummm. Tickets are 25 dollars where I am.

That is some serious entitlement and was a teachable moment for the parents to educate their kid about being respectful of someone else paying for your meal. I hope the kid felt guilty about costing his family their trip to see the Spiderman movie.", "This has me super curious - what are the three dishes???", "I have a medically restricted diet and usually order very similar things. People know this about me so there\u2019s never a problem. Even though sometimes my meal is me ordering two sides - they know I\u2019m not doing it to be cheap, I\u2019m just meeting my own needs.", "You mean my daughter in law.", "Lol", "They don't care.", "She certainly didn\u2019t. She ordered an appetizer, a side, an entr\u00e9e and a dessert. For later. LOL", "Lmao where the hell are you seeing movies. \n\nI literally brought my four daughters to the movies this weekend and it was like 95 dollars for tickets drinks and popcorn.", "I don\u2019t get why anyone doubles or triples the cost of their theater experience by buying drinks and food.  Yes, movie popcorn is delicious.  And makes you thirsty.  But not delicious enough to turn my $36 three person movie trip into a $68 dollar one.", "Because as I said. They thought they could guilt OP into paying for it.  They didn't plan on OP sticking to the agreement.", "What kind of *taco* place are you going to where there's a $90 platter and entrees start at $37?! Them tacos better have been made of wagyu beef or something! Usually, the Mexican places are much cheaper than other restaurants, so I'm honestly shocked at the prices you're quoting here...", "> $190 for a single 15yo's meal is...nah\n\nMaybe if that teen saved my life, lol. Other than that clear advantage of generosity.", "Plus tax and tips. So rude.  Plus she was paying for her sister\u2019s in-law.", "That's reasonable, but the OP was direct. Her sister and BiL are AHs, and the 15-year-old nephew should know better. Actually, her BiL *did* agree to pay, but he shouldn't have encouraged his kid to get the family meal for himself (alone).", "I love this, I think a lot of people would say it's tacky to talk money like this, but I think it's freeing to know exactly what the expectations are so you can relax and be confident you're meeting them...", "Fries\n\nChicken tenders\n\nKetchup", "Carbonarra, Lasagne or Chicken Parmagiana (which is the dearer of the 3)", "one bourbon\n\none scotch\n\none beer", "You mean my...\n\n...wait I have no one like that in life. Cool.", "Your sister married a monkey named Ron?  Sounds like a future sit-com to me.", "I'd immediately point out that did is on a separate check.

Snacks and drinks are also ridiculously expensive up here, two small fountain drinks, a popcorn, and candy will easily cost $30-40.", "AMC in cali two kids popcorn combos and one spider head popcorn bucket was $65.

Easily over $100 for all 6 even without every person getting their own drink and popcorn or snack", "Depending on the format, GA tickets where I live start at about $16/ticket.
