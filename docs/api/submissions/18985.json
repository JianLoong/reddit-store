He agreed to your terms and you paid for everyone else as you had intended.", "NTA. If you had paid for the son\u2019s meal, the leftovers would have been put in the garbage.\nYour brother could have told his son not to order the meal because he knew his son\u2019s eyes were bigger than his stomach.", "I hope son goes home and eats it all before dad can eat it or take it for lunch at work the next day I pray oh I \ud83d\ude4f son ate it b4 dad got to it", "Agree. Even if he ate it all, ordering it is rude AF.", "And what a terrible lesson to teach your kid! My parents always taught me to go cheap if someone else is paying.", "The audacity of the BIL to accuse OP of \u201ctrying to cheap out\u201d when his son picked a $190 dish \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThat part stuck out the most for me.  Like, who says that!?", "NTA this 100 percent. But I think this would be my last my treat meal. Especially since they tried to take advantage of you.", "And he did even come close to finishing it!  What the heck, the dad brought it on himself. \n\nNTA", "I take my cues from those who are hosting the dinner. I never order anything more expensive than what the hosts are eating.", "This! \n\nNTA", "Here\u2019s a LPT I think would have really helped here! And I think will help other people with generous dispositions who might get taken advantage of!\n\nThe LPT:  If you want to treat everyone to a meal, don\u2019t say anything til the end!\n\nAnnounce it when the check comes!  \n\nThis way, everyone orders what they would have usually ordered, you don\u2019t get taken advantage of, you are still able to treat the people you wanted too, and it\u2019s a surprise at the end of the meal!", "Yep!  FAFO.  Not the AH.", "Well the BIL cant teach his kid because the BIL obviously doesn\u2019t know any better himself", "Right? If I were the sister I would have stopped this nonsense when it started. \u201cNo, Tommy, you are not getting the Tomahawk Steak. Order something else\u201d", "I see that you\u2019ve met my brother-in law.", "Yes, and teaching his kid to be that AH makes the BIL an AHx2.", "Right? I was taken out to a work dinner and had three options ready: least expensive, mid tier, most expensive and ordered based on what everyone else got!   My most experienced option was less than many people, so that's what I got.  But I was *ready* with other options.", "IMO and the sister - she had to have known that her son couldn't eat a 3 pound steak.", "Maybe next time her sister will speak up as well - she had to have known her son wouldn't be able to eat a 3 pounds steak!", "You did a nice thing (taking everyone out to dinner) and taking advantage of that by ordering more than he could eat was an AH move. You identified the issue and reached agreement ahead of time on who will pay for it. You are NTA.", "Fifteen year old but yeah, all that.", "NTA. Let that be your lesson for next time. Next time, don't pay or set a restaurant budget.", "I am so sorry. This isn't funny but it's funny \ud83d\ude02.", "I think they thought OP would cover the steak, so even if it isn\u2019t eaten they all get a 2nd steak dinner as left overs.", "I don't think the price was really the issue. The kid ordered a dish meant for 4 people and he doubled down. If they went to sushi and he ordered a sushi boat with 12 rolls would you not question that decision?", "The nephew ordered a meal meant for 3 or 4 people. \n\nOP was willing to treat each person. Not buy one person 4 meals.", "I don\u2019t think it should have to be said when treating that the guests should be reasonable when ordering. They were told that the ordered entree was usually shared between three people. \u201cIt\u2019s my treat so order more than you can normally consume since you\u2019re not paying.\u201d I feel bad for anyone who offers to treat you to anything. I hope they know to set a monetary limit.", "Lol the kid tried to order a tomahawk which the waiter CONFIRMED usually feeds multiple people.", "You want to go middle. If you pick the cheapest item, the host may think you don't think they can afford it.\nDon't go the salad or soup, but don't go the steak or lobster either. You're going to want the pasta or chicken.", "It is poor form to order an entire family sized meal for yourself when someone else is paying.", "FAFO?", "Right!!! Heck, i might order for my kid if they pulled that!", "Do we have the same brother in law?", "Your brother in law sounds like my father in law.", "Even if he could eat it all, she should have told both her husband and son they were being incredibly rude, and shut them down. Especially because her husband doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay for movie tickets while her brother is treating husbands entire family. Who does that? My dad would have smacked me stupid and we rarely got punished.", "You know something is traumatic when you tell it as a joke and people just console you.", "Ha, yes respectfully cheap, not \u201cI think you\u2019re a pauper\u201d cheap", "fuck around and find out", "Fuck around and find out", "Does he have a monkey face and goes by the name Ron?", "Why you talking about my brother in law?"]}
