She\u2019ll send 10 page letters cussing you out and then she\u2019ll block you before you can reply. Basically reverted back into a teenager. \n\n9 months ago she needed a place to stay to get her life back on track after a bad relationship, her credit is fucked, can\u2019t rent, can\u2019t lease, and I had an extra room so I let her stay. She manipulated me into moving out so that she can \u201cdo her own thing\u201d \u201cgrow up\u201d \u201cbecome an adult\u201d so I left. It put me in a bad financial spot but I did it for her. \n\nI told her as long as she was responsible. Kept up with the bills, we\u2019d be good. No eviction. (She got a repossession on my credit some years back when I helped her with a car, as well as our brothers, so this was gonna be my straw) She agreed because she was planning on moving her best friend and girlfriend in so now 3 people splitting the bills, cool. I had nothin to worry about, the moneys there. She alone brings in 7k a month.

And I kept telling her \u201cokay I trust you because you want everyone to treat you as an adult. \u201c\n\nLights cut off, just everything behind. She\u2019d been getting the police called over there numerous times for domestic reasons. \n\nWhen the leasing office finally got ahold of me it was a mess. So now I\u2019m trying to clean it all up. 7k is what I now owe. She has no intent on paying or helping. Especially since she just got herself fired because she thinks she too good to work (works underneath older sister so always had job security).

I\u2019m sick her.\n\nI don\u2019t want me and my girlfriend getting stuck paying this we can\u2019t afford it. So researched I can file a small claim case for property less than 20k. She scammed the military so she gets a 90% check, that I would love to have garnished since she just blows it on bs anyways. \n\nIm always cleaning her messes us, we all are.\n\nI want to show her that she can\u2019t keep screwing people over and getting away with it.

That\u2019s was probably 7 years ago tho, we had since then made up eventually", "Yes, I thought the same thing.

There's gotta be a threshold somewhere.", "He acted like a big brother when he offered her help. She broke his trust and scammed him.

I had been trying to be a good big brother. That\u2019s all. And yeah it bit me.", "Sounds good.  I'm not a legal professional, but having a  \"he said she said\" with a known liar does concern me.", "That's not a panic disorder, that's just a shitty manipulative person. \n\nBut I think you're realizing that.", "ok then you know what you have to do, gl my friend", "Your post 11 days ago to AITA before it was removed, was about giving an ultimatum to your girlfriend, and now it's your sister.

And you played Mr. Nice Guy. \n\nBe the bigger person. If you sue her, she's just going to think your an asshole for the rest of your lives. That's your fucking sister dude.

I never would have been dumb enough to trust her in the first place.", "Because that's what big brothers do.\n\nHopefully, one day she grows up. Then, maybe she can make amends. If not, at least OP's side of the street is clean.\n\nThink about it, if you were a mother, and this was going on between your kids, would you want to see your son sue your daughter?", "The conduct of the parties can count as evidence of the existence and terms of an oral agreement. Here the sister was living in the apartment and I guess paying rent to the landlord until she stopped? Not clear on all the details, but whatever they are will presumably support OP's testimony as to the terms of the agreement (along with any relevant text messages / emails / documents that may exist). It's not bulletproof but definitely worth trying.\n\nBut again, OP should consult sources on local tenancy law because that may affect the viability of the suit.", "I learned something new today \"GL\"  gonna borrow this thanks", "That's an awfully big double standard.

And i have seen shit in my family and what happens when you enable family members even though you know what they do is wrong. My own father is like this. He betrayed us all big time. \n\nI see you talking a lot in here how family *should* act. Great but that won\u2019t work for everyone. At some point people have to stand up for themselves. Even when it\u2019s against family. And OP is in this situation right now. He has to stop enabling his sister and do some damage control for himself.", "No that\u2019s not what they do if they have been financially screwed by their sister.
