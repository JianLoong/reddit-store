Basically reverted back into a teenager. \n\n9 months ago she needed a place to stay to get her life back on track after a bad relationship, her credit is fucked, can\u2019t rent, can\u2019t lease, and I had an extra room so I let her stay.

Here the sister was living in the apartment and I guess paying rent to the landlord until she stopped? Not clear on all the details, but whatever they are will presumably support OP's testimony as to the terms of the agreement (along with any relevant text messages / emails / documents that may exist).

I figured if he ripped me off I could jump ship without being on the hook for whatever he does. Good thing I did, because...as soon as he moved in he refused to pay bills. He would come up empty almost every time and wouldn't tell me where the money went. I was taking from my savings to keep everything afloat when with my last roommate I was saving hundreds per month. Meanwhile he wouldn't lift a finger to clean his messes and would wake me up at 6 every morning with his alarm blaring nonstop for 2 hours. I even had to walk an hour to the grocery store in 100-degree weather on low-level chemotherapy because he would throw fits when I asked him to give me a lift there.\n\nI left after less than 2 months.

He had some roommates come in at first, but...they quickly left because they refused to put up with him. I found out after he moved that he was putting all of his money towards weed and parties, while telling everybody that his sister was mooching off of him...\n\nEventually he moved in with our father before eventually leaving after he was badgered enough to pay rent. Now our father is fighting him every single month to make his car payments...he keeps promising he will each month only to not do it, and has caused our father's credit score to drop over 100 points...ruined his plans to buy a new home. He keeps telling our father that he is trying to \"save his money for an investment\".\n\nHe makes 2800 a month after tax, and has moved in with his new girlfriend without having to pay rent. I have it on good authority that he is \"investing\" in weed and party drinks. He just hopes that if he keeps fighting dear old dad tooth and nail he can eventually just get him to give up and start paying it.\n\nMe? He knows not to ask me for a cent after what he pulled.
