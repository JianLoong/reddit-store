Because it's in a nature reserve, the venue let us know that we couldn't have dogs at our wedding, unless it was very specifically OUR dog who they met before to check they would be well-behaved, would stay on the lead the whole time, etc. Our dog is a rescue and actually still a little nervy around new people so we decided it was best if she stayed home with a sitter and we just had a dog-free wedding.\n\nWe sent out save the dates last week and a couple days ago I got a message from my cousin asking if we'd forgotten to put his dog's name on the invite. The thing is, his dog is not at ALL trained. He jumps up at people, barks and whines constantly if he's not getting attention, has extreme separation anxiety (to the point where they can't even both go to the bathroom at the same time or he will destroy furniture), has been known to nip when he gets excited and is generally just not well-behaved. This is completely my cousin's fault for getting a high-energy breed and then not doing any training with him, but my point is that if I were to invite ANY dog, this is the last one I'd choose because his behaviour is not suited to a group event where it will be loud and stressful for the dog. I replied and explained we couldn't have dogs, unfortunately. At this point he kicked off and asked if I was expecting him to pay for a new suit, travel, hotel etc AND now a weekend at a kennels, and if his dog wasn't invited he wasn't going to come, because his dog's separation anxiety means he cannot be left with anyone else. I was pretty pissed off but replied and said I totally understand that travelling here would be an expense for him and if the extra money needed for a sitter/kennels meant he couldn't come, I was sad he won't make it but understand and would be great to catch up some other time. He never replied and I left it. \n\nI really didn't think I'd done anything wrong tbh but now I'm being hassled by multiple members of my family who are telling me I'm being a stubborn asshole for not making an exception for this one dog. My mom's argument is that if we're not taking our dog, my cousin's dog can be there instead, and that I'm causing a huge family row because we're being \"bridezilla-y\".

Your cousin,  not you.", "Why do dog people just assume you can bring your animal everywhere? Why add the stress to the animal?", "NTA at all. This is just ridiculous. It makes no sense for your cousin to bring his dog to the wedding. Do you think you could maybe ask the venue if they'd be willing to take the fall for this one? You could tell your family that you asked for permission for your cousin's dog, but you'd already told the venue that you weren't bringing your dog so you had to admit it wasn't yours, and they said no because they knew he wasn't yours and they have very strict rules about only the couple's dog being allowed. Just make sure the venue is okay/aware of this, in case your cousin tries to call and complain or something! Alternatively, if just telling him that won't work, you could introduce his dog to the owners of the venue prior to the ceremony, as you would have to do anyway if you took your own. You said he's not trained at all, so the venue will have a reason to fail him, but talk to the venue before and ask them if they're willing to take the fall for you even if he magically manages to behave perfectly, and fail him. Whichever one, if the venue is willing to tell your cousin \"no\", then you can tell your family it's out of your hands and you did try, but you can't force them- and you've paid for and organised everything and it's too late to change the venue and you won't get refunded, if they try to convince you to do that. It sounds like the venue is pretty strict on allowing dogs anyway, so if you explain the situation to them and how he's not well trained beforehand, they won't want him there so would be willing to tell your cousin no, if he tries to push the issue with them.\n\n Sometimes people involve their pets in the ceremony eg the dog is the ring bearer, but then they presumably get taken home/to a kennel/to accommodation they're allowed to be left alone in/wherever. They can usually sit through a ceremony if they're well trained and the ceremony doesn't go for hours, and having a mat or bed they can go lie down on is a good idea, and maybe a puzzle feeder like a frozen Kong to keep them occupied. If it was me, if also assign someone to be in charge of the dog, so if it starts barking etc, they can take it outside/away so the wedding isn't interrupted.\n\nBut, they don't attend the reception. They're not going to enjoy it. They'll get bored and probably stressed with all the loud music and dancing. Someone would need to take care of the dog the whole time, so couldn't relax and enjoy themselves at all, they'd constantly be worried about the dog. I feel like it's ok to have someone in charge of the dog during the ceremony if it's not long, and if the dog is well trained and you've prepared something to occupy them if they're high energy/a bed to nap on/whatever, it wouldn't be asking to much of them, and it's unlikely the person in charge of the dog would have to take them out so they miss the ceremony. The reception would just be a bad idea for everyone involved.\n\nAnd this is when it's the dog of the people getting married! I've never heard of a guest trying to bring their dog to a wedding, with the exception of a service dog, which is a medical device and no different to bringing your wheelchair, not a pet.

Her description makes it sound like that's for very good reason.  People like cousin, with badly-behaved dogs because they have failed in the training department, are very often the pushy, entitled people who think the world should love their dog anyway.  OP clearly is, generally, a dog-lover, and has her own dog.  It's not that weird that she feels some guilt about wanting to say \"No\" about cousin's dog.  She can't really tell cousin flat-out that the dog is a nightmare, because cousin clearly isn't rational about this.\n\nRegardless: the venue was only going to make an exception for OP's dog because they saw how well-trained OP's dog is.  There is no way the venue would make an exception for cousin's nightmare dog. \n\nBut cousin and others in the family aren't focusing on that. They're bombarding OP as if it's OP's decision to make.
