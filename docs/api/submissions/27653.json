Because it's in a nature reserve, the venue let us know that we couldn't have dogs at our wedding, unless it was very specifically OUR dog who they met before to check they would be well-behaved, would stay on the lead the whole time, etc. Our dog is a rescue and actually still a little nervy around new people so we decided it was best if she stayed home with a sitter and we just had a dog-free wedding.\n\nWe sent out save the dates last week and a couple days ago I got a message from my cousin asking if we'd forgotten to put his dog's name on the invite. The thing is, his dog is not at ALL trained. He jumps up at people, barks and whines constantly if he's not getting attention, has extreme separation anxiety (to the point where they can't even both go to the bathroom at the same time or he will destroy furniture), has been known to nip when he gets excited and is generally just not well-behaved. This is completely my cousin's fault for getting a high-energy breed and then not doing any training with him, but my point is that if I were to invite ANY dog, this is the last one I'd choose because his behaviour is not suited to a group event where it will be loud and stressful for the dog. I replied and explained we couldn't have dogs, unfortunately. At this point he kicked off and asked if I was expecting him to pay for a new suit, travel, hotel etc AND now a weekend at a kennels, and if his dog wasn't invited he wasn't going to come, because his dog's separation anxiety means he cannot be left with anyone else. I was pretty pissed off but replied and said I totally understand that travelling here would be an expense for him and if the extra money needed for a sitter/kennels meant he couldn't come, I was sad he won't make it but understand and would be great to catch up some other time. He never replied and I left it. \n\nI really didn't think I'd done anything wrong tbh but now I'm being hassled by multiple members of my family who are telling me I'm being a stubborn asshole for not making an exception for this one dog. My mom's argument is that if we're not taking our dog, my cousin's dog can be there instead, and that I'm causing a huge family row because we're being \"bridezilla-y\".

Because a wedding is not a place for dogs unless they are invited specifically. I never had to tell her that.", "NTA\n\nIf your somewhat trained dog didn't make the cut, why would his not trained dog be allowed? This isn't on you. If they really push it,set up a meeting and let the venue tell them their dog isn't allowed. Then it's not on you.", "NTA, since when was bringing dogs to a wedding a thing?", "NTA. Your cousins dog is not your problem.", "What the actual fuck. NTA!!! I love my dogs and bring the one EVERYWHERE. That being said, when he\u2019s not allowed places he stays home!\n\nMy goodness to throw a hissy fit over a freakin DOG not being invited to a wedding\u2026 when it\u2019s not even your rule! It\u2019s the venue.", "OMG, NTA!  Tell your family that this issue is not open for discussion.  If they insist, leave.", "Not only that, but I've never in my life heard of a guest bringing their pet to a wedding, much less the pets being formally included on the invitation! I'd be gobsmacked if somebody reached out to me asking if I *forgot to invite their dog*.", "I also love my dog very much, but even if this was a perfectly well behaved dog, I'm with the boomers on this one. Dogs shouldnt go everywhere with you. \n\nIf you love your dog you will train it. It's not OPs fault that the cousin is a shitty owner.", "100% NTA - the venue even stated that the only exception would be their own dog and only then of the dog was met before and seemed to be well behaved. Even if OP felt compelled to pass off disaster dog as her own I have no doubt the venue would nix it on meeting them. Family is being incredibly entitled here", "There was a Reddit about a guy bringing his pet raccoon to a wedding when he was asked not to. \ud83e\udd9d", "Yeah, I have seen this issue several times and cannot believe the audacity. It's amazing you now have to stipulate your wedding is pet-free, and even crazier that people will argue over it.", "I know I've never heard of such a thing.", "I take my (pet) dogs most places, but it would never cross my mind to take them to a wedding.", "Yeah we'd definitely be okay with a service dog! In fact it would (I think) be illegal for our venue to NOT let a service dog in. Plus, I know service dogs are incredibly well-trained, for good reason!", "I'm equally flabbergasted that they expected the dog to be personally invited and I come from a family that has sent cards to each other \"from\" our pets.", "Since Covid people have got especially weird about their pets. \"Fur babies\" is the absolute worst term in the world, but some people genuinely do view their pets to be equal to humans", "I've been to a wedding with dogs.  But it was an extremely casual one.  Outdoors and the couple/venue was explicitly fine with it.", "Or actually \"invited\"", "I can't think of a place my high energy dog would enjoy less than a wedding. And I know I wouldn't be able to enjoy a wedding with my dog.", "I'm also with the boomers on this one.  Mostly because I have a mild fear of dogs and an allergy.", "As they say in the North of England, where I come from, 'There's nowt so queer as folk'", "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/epGuAKyTGq", "But yiu don't understand.   He looked cute in his bowtie :)", "Ohhh my goodness\ud83d\ude48 'Dear Sparky it would be an honour to have you and your plus 1 at our wedding'", "My sil FaceTime her daughters dog all the time lol", "A lot of people with no experience with pets also got them but didn't take them to formal training because of lockdowns. Now they've raised an anxious mess and don't even realize the probkem because they think dogs are furry little people.", "This was my thinking exactly and tbh I was shocked he would even want to bring his dog in the first place. Like, they'd have to spend large portions of time sitting still, not allowed to run around, lots of loud music etc. Just a dog's worst day out, surely.", "I loved being in Newcastle! My popsie was so broad, ahdidnageat'hat - whaaaat?", "Every time I think of this post, I can't help but laugh.", "Those dang bowties causing all the troubles. lol You just can't find good raccoon babysitters these days."]}
