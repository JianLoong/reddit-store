(Side note: I've met them once and our son never had.) It was in another state so we made it a little weekend vacation. My husband was in the wedding party and our son was one of the ring bearers so we had to arrive early (10am) for pictures and to help with last minute prep. Ceremony was at 3pm. Everything went great.  Afterwards we went to the reception and let our son run around to get energy out then went inside. My husband was sitting with the wedding party and I was at a table with our son and some other people. Not 5 minutes in he was screaming and wanting to run around. I try to distract him with crayons, toys, a tablet and snacks. Nope he was not having it. They started introducing everyone in the wedding party so all the guests were trying to listen, itsnot pin drop quiet but not loud enough to cover at 2 year old screaming. I took our son outside to let him run around and tried to return after about 10 minutes. People were mingling now so I felt comfortable if he was loud again. Met up with my husband and tried to chat with other guests. Issue was our son wanted to run and he is small so he can zip between people, I can not. So after chasing him around inside, (husband went back to hang out with the wedding party) I took him back outside where I could keep a better eye on him. When they started serving dinner I went back inside hoping food would distract him enough to sit for a few minutes. Nope he wanted nothing to do with inside and started screaming again. Let me clear up what I mean by screaming... it's the high pitch \"no\", \"let go\", \"no sit\", \"I play\" screeching that only toddlers can do. Back outside I go but this time to the car. We read book, sing songs and I put a movie on. He's happy. I stay in the car with our son until after dinner, speeches, and dances. My husband comes outside and says everyone is start to party so we should go sign the guest book and say our goodbyes. We go do just that. I thought everything was fine. The next day my husband tells me that I ruined his night and was selfish by not being inside during his \"free time\" so I could be with him and socialize with the other guests.

It\u2019s his friend\u2019s wedding!  Soooooooo NTA!", "Your husband thought a screaming, squirmy child was better to have inside with all the other guests???? And all because he didn\u2019t want to be alone? I\u2019m sure the bride and groom (and every other guest there) was very thankful you handled it the way you did. NTA.", "Wow. NTA for going outside to mind your son and try to distract him. If he wanted you to be able to pay attention to him y'all should've gotten a babysitter for the reception", "Excuse me!?!?! You were SELFISH by keeping HIS son occupied!?!? \n\nDefinitely NTA. HE definitely is.", "NTA. That is an extremely long day for a 2 year old. Did he have a nap at all? \n\nYou did everything right.", "NTA buy your husband is an impressive asshole. You ran around trying to keep your child quiet while everyone else including your husband got enjoy the wedding and reception. You didn\u2019t eat, dance or socialize. Many parents would have let their child run wild. You did your job and did it damn well. Your husband sucks!", "NTA - absolutely not. You did the right thing removing your kid and taking him outside.", "NTA.  Who exactly did he think was going to look after your kid?  Wow.", "NTA. You had to look after your son, of course. Your husband is an AH for not acknowledging this. Would he prefer all the wedding guests to resent your son for his behaviour? I am impressed that he was such a good boy all through the day, by the way. Not many two-year-olds would have held out from 10 am to 5 pm. Some solid parenting went into that, and we all see that this didn't really come from his dad.", "Nta you did the right thing he probably got a lot of questions wheres you're wife, where's you're family? And it made him look bad that you had to take your 2yr out and he didn't go help. So he's taking it out on you.", ">The next day my husband tells me that I ruined his night and was selfish by not being inside during his \"free time\" so I could be with him and socialize with the other guests. AITA?\n\nWho was supposed to take care of his son during this time?\nOh wait, that was OP!\n\n\nWhy is your husband mad that you can't be in two places at the same time???\n\n\nNTA", "NTA and special commendation for demonstrating all the many other AITA's about having childless weddings are also NTA.", "NTA. Your husband is the asshole.", "NTA, you went above and beyond being kind and thoughtful about everyone else's needs, prioritized your child' s wellbeing, cared for him by yourself while husband was having a good  time.  He owes you a big apology. You take good care of yourself.", "NTA\n\nWould he preferred to have his son handed to him to sort out while you mingled..? ummm, he was part of the wedding party so had a bigger part to play than you did so it made sense for you to care with your son.  You kept your son in check so he didn't disturb every other person inside with his squealing.  He's a 2 year old kid that would rather run around outside... pretty expected really.  Plus he'd been involved for hours already and was done.\n\nAnd it was your husband that said he wanted to sign the book and go.  Theoretically you could've been the one to go and he stay on and party because he's part of the wedding party.\n\nMy only suggestion is that if there is a next time.. to have someone else who could take your son (or any other kids you might end up having) home if they've had enough and it's making everyone's lives hard including theirs.\n\nIs this common behaviour for your husband?", "Did your son take a nap at all? Having him on-site at 3 years old all day was a huge mistake. He became overstimulated. Poor kid. I would have found sitter / stayed home", "ESH. Your husband for his reaction and for both of you for thinking having a two year old at a long wedding day like that is a good idea.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Interesting that he wanted you to hang with him during his free time but didn\u2019t think about where your free time was. And who exactly was going to take care of the child during that free time?
