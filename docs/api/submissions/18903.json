I had one relationship where he started showing a very different face to me in private than he did in front of other people. And I do fully believe he had good intentions the whole way through, but you can have good intentions and still really hurt someone. \n\nThe breakup was messy. During the first part I remember sitting there and wondering inside my mind \"why am I not walking out the door right now? Why am I letting myself being treated like this right now?\" for multiple hours. Afterwards, we had broken up and temporarily reconciled. I attended an annual event with my mother and sibling, and he joined for the tail end, and afterwards asked to drive me home instead of me going with them. I agreed. \n\nAs soon as I was separated from my family, his demeanor changed. I won't get into the semantics, but for the first time I felt physically unsafe with someone I thought I could trust. (Once again,  I don't think he was actively malevolent. But that's not enough.). As soon as I was in front of my parents house where I lived at the time, with a hand on the door handle and my seat belt unlocked, I told him it was over and got out. \n\nI love my parents and they love me. They will have my back if I need them. And on both sides I have had aunts who ended up in really crappy situations for a bit, but who all have found some solid long term partners. I think there might be a wariness in them about badmouthing someone who a loved one is infatuated with and alienating them from seeking help when shit hits the fan. \n\nWith all of that in mind, when I was in this internal crisis mode, I was able to collect anything he had an obvious claim to in the house, hand it to him in a bag and then curl into my dad's hug to sob but feel safe. Meanwhile my mom went out to talk to him and make sure that he was at least in a calm enough state of mind to safely drive home and both parents have expressed sympathy since. I love my parents for their compassion, and I also have many moments feeling like \"I needed you to be unequivocally on my side for this and magically know the details I was afraid to tell you\"\n\nNTA.
