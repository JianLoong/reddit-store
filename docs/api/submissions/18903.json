If I had a bitter breakup and a horrible contested divorce I would expect my family to cut my ex off completely as well. If he's still \"her son\" then they can have each other.", ">Now people are like \u201coh, this divorce has been hard on your mom\u201d\n\nEveryone who says this can also be blocked. I'm sorry this is happening to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA with everything he has done it really sucks your mum can't prioritise your feelings first.", "NTA. Your mom is making this about *herself* and her needs -- rather that understanding that it's about her child and a person who is deeply hurting her child. I get it that it's disappointing for her if she enjoyed the relationship with your ex, but that's life. IMO loyalty and caring for you win out over that.", "NTA. Wow you got some awful people around you. I'm sorry to hear. How long have you been married? (and how long has your mom known your ex husband?) I think she is clearly taking his side and making herself out to be the victim. And people are easily taking her side cause she is \"the mom\" so her word takes priority. She probably deliberately talked to other people behind your back about your problems in way that only makes her look good because \"shee means well\" but naw that only counts if she isn't hurting her child. So yeah i'm sorry to say you have to cut your mother off and maybe she will see sense.", "Wow, NTA! This is not about your mother, the divorce hasn't been \"so hard\" for her. But I'm sure it was for you. The man you married and loved was cheating on you, he proved his love for you was fake, and your mother is treating him like a \"son\"... WTH? Very good at wanting this man far away from you, and keep your mother very very far away from you too, as she has literally chosen the cheating husband of her own daughter instead of you. I'm really sorry.", "NTA - what you\u2019re feeling is completely warranted. Having a misogynistic mom sucks. Hang in there.", "NTA", "Not and asshole at all, you should have your mom unconditional support no matter what. In the other hand as hard as it can be for you, try to understand where your mom behaviour is coming from. You only have one and if it is not worthy to lose her", "NTA", "\u201cMom, all else aside, he had a Tinder account and was cheating on me. If that\u2019s acceptable to you, you\u2019re not acceptable to me.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA.  TF is up with your mom?", "NTA - A painful, nitpicking divorce must be pure hell. But a mother who is siding with your soon to be ex is pain on another level entirely. It baffles me how your mother cannot see this. Perhaps show her this post as a wake-up call. Good luck-hope ya got the dogs!", "NTA.  I could understand if you two had kids together and doing it, so the kids had consistency, but... WTF.", "NTA. My mom also chose my ex at the beginning of my divorce process. My ex is a narcissist and was so charismatic and good at making me look like the bad guy. When I gave my mom the same ultimatum as you, my dad who upholds \"happy wife happy life\" finally put his foot down and said that they will not be losing their daughter. I hope your mom has her eyes opened and that she chooses you.", "How long were you married?", "Info: How long were you married? If this was a 3 year marriage and like 5 total years of a relationship then mom is being terrible.\n\nIf it's like 20 I mean I can see how she sees him as another kid sort of.\n\nProbably NTA either way. Just saying it's hard for a parent to quit on a child even if it's an inlaw sometimes .", "YTA. You simply cannot dictate who someone can or cannot talk to. Period. People who give ultimatums are childish assholes.", "YTA. You divorced your ex. You have every right to have no contact with him. Giving your mom an ultimatum crosses the line.", "Having your mom on your ex\u2019s side must be extremely disappointing and hurtful after all you introduced him to her\u2026 she must also be having a hard time removing him from her life as she seemed to love him the entire time. This is an odd situation but you\u2019re definitely not an ass for being hurt\u2026 but cutting your mom off may not be the right response.", ">My ex can be in her life or me.\n\nYTA. Ultimatums are garbage ways to resolve conflict.", "INFO - Divorce sucks and living through the pettiness of that division sucks worse, it drags up some really fiery feelings that might change or at least lessen when the dust finally settles.  \n\nRemember that the version of your husband your mother sees is the best version of him, the one who made you happy, so happy you got married. The public face on social media that is all the flash and smile and none of the mundane or strain you see behind the curtain.   \n\nYour mother caring for both of you makes sense.  Your mother choosing his feelings over yours because of a desire for a son feels selfish on her part.  Your choice to block your mother and cut her out of your life seems rash.  \n\nBut without knowing more of the backstory and relationships, not prepared to call anyone an asshole. Just a lot of broken pieces, a big painful mess.  Wishing you well and I hope it gets better", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
