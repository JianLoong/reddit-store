I wasn't expecting it and they never spend this much on gifts so it took me by surprise. Not to give exact numbers but it was four digits. I was very grateful and thanked them for there generous gift.\r  \n\r  \nEverything was great......until the day after Christmas. My dad would come up to me multiple times and asked if I deposited the check. I told him that I would and that I could deposit it through by banking app. Well the day goes on and I forget to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nThe 27th comes along and I get home from work and my dad gets on me again and asks if I deposited the check. I told him no and he seemed annoyed and again told me to deposit the check. Well as you can probably guess the day ends with me again forgetting to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nNow it's today (the 28th) and my mom texts me while I'm at work asking if I deposited the check. I told her no and she must have told dad because he started angrily texting me.\r  \n\r  \n\"I asked you to do something and you didn't do it. I'm so upset with you OP it's not even funny. This is a total disrespect of me and your mom. I asked you to deposit the that check and you didn't. You know we did this because we love you and you turn around and not deposit the check like I asked. I'm so upset. Just give me the check and I'll deposit it in your account if you're that lazy. Ungrateful\"\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked when I read that while at work. And I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. I spent most of my lunch break in tears trying to think of a response. I love my dad a lot but I felt like his anger was out of line and needlessly malicious. Unfortunately, while my dad is loving most of the time he does have bouts of anger like this (like once a year not often at all). He never gets physical or anything but is very loud.\r  \n\r  \nEventually I texted him back saying: \"Hi dad, I'm sorry that this has made you upset. It's not that I'm ungrateful. I guess I just don't understand why this needs to be deposited right away. Especially since it hasn't even been a week since I received your very generous gift. I love you very much and I don't want this to damage our relationship. So I think it's no longer appropriate for me to accept this check. I'll give you the check back when I get home.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought that was the best and most mature way to reply. Maybe he'll calm down?..........No.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHe replied back with this: \"OP when I tell you to do something I want it done. When your mom asks you to do something you do it. Now I want you to deposit that check today or I will disconnect your internet (we live in the same house). I ask for the simplest thing and you cant give that to me. I have my reasons for wanting the check cashed. You should honor my wish. As far as I'm concerned, this has damaged our relationship.\"\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI've since deposited the check like he asked, but I'm really confused am I really in the wrong here or is he blowing this out of proportion?", "created_utc": 1703813560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18taniq/aita_for_not_depositing_my_christmas_check/", "score": 389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds a whole lot like ADHD-PI to me.\n\nLeaning toward YTA.", "I don't know about y'all, but their insistence on this is raising some red flags. If they've got a checking account,  why didn't they wire the money? Or withdraw it and give it to them as cash? Something seems off about this.", "Can't people figure out a checking account anymore?  I know exactly what's in my account because I still keep a physical record.  My total, in the log, is what I have. Doesn't matter what the bank says--transactions may well still need to clear.  I've already accounted for those in my  records.  I worked in banking years ago and all-too-frequently had to remind customers that the bank balance is not necesary your actual balance.

Until it's in your account, you can't use it either.\n\nBut I'm not sure I'd spend the money.  I can see in a few weeks or months, your dad will use that money to control you ie we gave you that money so you need to do X, Y and Z, or they want a say in something... because they gave you that money.  If that starts happening you can turn around and say that you can give them that money right back if they want to play that game.  I sense issues with this money in the future so I simply would leave it in an easily accessible high interest account where you can keep the interest (ie don't tell your dad) and give him back the principle if he wants to play controlling games.\n\nI'm someone that would need to go to an ATM to put a cheque into my account as I don't have my banks app (well I tried but it wouldn't work on my phone and it's not the end of the world that I don't have it). \n\nI did find a cheque that my MIL had given my husband about 3 years ago in my wallet the other day (clearly I don't open that part of it often either) but I'm not depositing it... she may not realise I never banked it and she'll wonder what the money is that has come out... not worth it (the story is much longer than that though so it's not that simple).  So the only person that missed out there was me.  The money never came out of her account, same as the money doesn't come out of your dad's account till the cheque is deposited... unless it's a bank cheque.

I wasn't expecting it and they never spend this much on gifts so it took me by surprise. Not to give exact numbers but it was four digits. I was very grateful and thanked them for there generous gift.\r  \n\r  \nEverything was great......until the day after Christmas. My dad would come up to me multiple times and asked if I deposited the check. I told him that I would and that I could deposit it through by banking app. Well the day goes on and I forget to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nThe 27th comes along and I get home from work and my dad gets on me again and asks if I deposited the check. I told him no and he seemed annoyed and again told me to deposit the check. Well as you can probably guess the day ends with me again forgetting to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nNow it's today (the 28th) and my mom texts me while I'm at work asking if I deposited the check. I told her no and she must have told dad because he started angrily texting me.\r  \n\r  \n\"I asked you to do something and you didn't do it. I'm so upset with you OP it's not even funny. This is a total disrespect of me and your mom. I asked you to deposit the that check and you didn't. You know we did this because we love you and you turn around and not deposit the check like I asked. I'm so upset. Just give me the check and I'll deposit it in your account if you're that lazy. Ungrateful\"\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked when I read that while at work. And I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. I spent most of my lunch break in tears trying to think of a response. I love my dad a lot but I felt like his anger was out of line and needlessly malicious. Unfortunately, while my dad is loving most of the time he does have bouts of anger like this (like once a year not often at all). He never gets physical or anything but is very loud.\r  \n\r  \nEventually I texted him back saying: \"Hi dad, I'm sorry that this has made you upset. It's not that I'm ungrateful. I guess I just don't understand why this needs to be deposited right away. Especially since it hasn't even been a week since I received your very generous gift. I love you very much and I don't want this to damage our relationship. So I think it's no longer appropriate for me to accept this check. I'll give you the check back when I get home.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought that was the best and most mature way to reply. Maybe he'll calm down?..........No.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHe replied back with this: \"OP when I tell you to do something I want it done. When your mom asks you to do something you do it.

I have my reasons for wanting the check cashed. You should honor my wish.

No need for dad to act like that.", "Soft YTA, and I mean very soft.\n\nYou sound a bit ADHD ish, which I totally get, but there are a number of reasons why someone would flip if a large check isn\u2019t deposited right away.\n\n1. Overdrafting, especially if it\u2019s a significant amount comparative to income. A lot of bills come out at the first of the month/end of the month automatically. What might be there that day might not be available in a week and the longer it takes to cash the longer they have to keep the account aboveboard to cover it.\n\n2. Taxes. Especially after Christmas season when they\u2019re looking at \u201cgifts\u201d to appear that are taxable in accounts. \n\n3. Security. If I gave someone four figures in a check form, I\u2019d absolutely lose my ever loving mind if they lost it and that money disappeared because they simply\u2026didn\u2019t deposit. You\u2019re holding a significant sum of money that can be stolen, \ndropped, or lost very easily.\n\n4. Deposit cut off. (I\u2019m not 100% on this since I\u2019ve only encountered it once and it was work related so take this one worth a grain of salt) Checks, depending on bank to bank region or credit to credit region, have an expiration date on when they can be deposited. If a check isn\u2019t deposited within a certain time frame that check can be automatically cancelled by the bank. If you are a bit ADHD and your parents know this, that could explain why they\u2019re flipping out since that becomes a whole pain in the butt process in the future. I, personally, didn\u2019t know this was a thing until I came back from LOA and tried to deposit a check from over two months prior and got told off when a new one had to be made.\n\n4. The way it comes off. Anytime you gift someone money, especially large bits of money, there\u2019s a low key expectation of gratefulness for it no matter how stupid that sounds. When you\u2019re forgetful about depositing a check that was gifted, it can come off as you really don\u2019t give a flying eff about the money that they gave you. Though I\u2019ve seen that more with the 45 and older crowd with a hit and miss attitude about it in the 30+ crowd. \n\nAnywho, could be a lot of reasons why he\u2019s losing his mind, however threatening to cut off the internet is a bit extreme. If he\u2019s absolutely that stressed about it, it should have been a \u201chey, I need you to stop what you\u2019re doing and deposit this right now for x,y,z reasons\u201d. Then, if you had refused entirely and blew them off again. That would have been the YTA. Right now, it\u2019s seems like every made some less than stellar decisions and had equally less than stellar reactions", "NTA. Your dad's controlling, bottom line. A gift is a gift, it's not his anymore. It's been less than a week and the one time he checks his account in that time (normally) he can just remember $1k less overall. This reaction he is having is temper tantrum worry. My only real guess is he didn't want to give it in the first place and is now stewing over it. Also just deposit the damn thing, I'm sure you've driven past your bank 3 times already.", "Tbh my dad would be the same way and it is largely because he would be mad at me for not \u201caccepting\u201d the gift. Like there\u2019s an element of giving money that is different than opening a physical present and if you don\u2019t deposit it right away, then it\u2019s like leaving the gift behind. Sure they also could need that taken out immediately for tax or budgeting purposes, but I would honestly feel like it\u2019s more likely he\u2019s just upset that you didn\u2019t \u201ctake your present home\u201d.", "NTA. I fully understand wanting to make sure that it gets deposited so that the money for the check isn't sitting in his own account (it sucks to think you have more money than you actually do because a payment you issued is taking longer than expected to process), but if he's REALLY that concerned about it he should have withdrawn the amount and given you cash instead of writing a check. There's no reason to blow up like that TWO DAYS after Chrsitmas at someone you're giving a gift to.

You can deposit the damn thing in like 30 seconds from your phone, so why when they've directly asked you to do it, are you stubbornly refusing to?\n\nI'm quite old and I know how checks work. If I wrote a check, it is no big deal if the check is not deposited right away. I have never in my life hounded a person to deposit a check that I've written.

I suspect Dad got some unexpected end-of-year money (Xmas bonus) which put him over some threshold, and he was advised to get rid of it -- quickly, by year end, and with a proper paper trail that it left his \"umbrella\" and is no longer under his control. Bank transfer would require getting the banking info of the kids and actually can take a lot longer, especially during Xmas holidays and end of year.", "The parents would have had to go to the bank, pull out 4 figures in cash, and then hand it to OP who would have had to take it to the bank to deposit.  Instead of writing a check that simply needs to be deposited via a mobile app that takes seconds to do\u2026..", "They need a paper trail of the gift.", "If he knew that the simple request to cash the check would be ignored there are probably several thing that could have been done.

I\u2019m not familiar with cashing cheques, but since a mobile app seems to be involved it could have been done right away.", "I have zero clue why anyone would want a check cashed ASAP. There are no good reasons. OP is basically giving her parents an interest-free loan for every day she doesn\u2019t cash it.

I don't understand why it's bothering him so much. He is treating OP like a small child by expecting immediate obedience.", "Can\u2019t the parents transfer the money? This seems a total over the top reaction, without any context as to WHY ITS SO URGENT they deposit the cheque THIS SECOND", "Will you stop this? Checks are used in many countries, including OP's.

We get you have an irrational hate if checks,  but good grief...", "Sometimes checks are still the best option, such as in this situation, where the other option is cash.

I was thinking dad was getting annoyed because he was trying to control OP but now realizing it\u2019s almost a new month so maybe they\u2019re trying to get finances in order and the check can also make a difference in getting cleared from their acc as well as the fact that it\u2019s a big amount on a paper anyone can try to deposit", "I get that the gift is tax free for OP.  It counts in the year that the check. was deposited.\n\nBut the check as not close to the max amount allowed.  The amount was 4 figures, not close to $17,000. which is the max allowed  from one person.  Parents can actually double the amount and gift a person $34,000.", "A gift is a gift. Once you've given it you have no control over it or license to demand anything.

Doesn't sound shady, sounds the opposite actually.\n\nI don't let checks sit because I don't want to forget to deposit them, but I can't see how it's rude. People should keep track of the checks they write in a register or by some other method anyway.", "Right? OP cried throughout their lunch and argued with their parents but still didn\u2019t deposit.", "They were at work at lunch, the check was probably at home. That said, they should have done it before then anyway.", "Probably because they want to bring their checking account balance down to a certain number and the best way to do that is writing a check.

They would have to account for that cash money. It's a lot more difficult via cash than check.", "I didn\u2019t think so either, but I\u2019m not a tax accountant.", "And?", "Because you\u2019re good with money, and a lot of people aren\u2019t, especially people in the position to consistently worry that they\u2019re overdrafting their bank account.

At some point, they just assume the money is has left their account. I got burned by this exactly once, with a body shop that took almost three months to deposit a check. I was still in college and it was the start of the semester, so a lot of money was coming and going out of my account. I wasn't keeping track. I assumed that the $500+ check I wrote for my car had been cashed. It hadn't. When it finally went through, it overdrafted by close to $200.
