I wasn't expecting it and they never spend this much on gifts so it took me by surprise. Not to give exact numbers but it was four digits. I was very grateful and thanked them for there generous gift.\r  \n\r  \nEverything was great......until the day after Christmas. My dad would come up to me multiple times and asked if I deposited the check. I told him that I would and that I could deposit it through by banking app. Well the day goes on and I forget to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nThe 27th comes along and I get home from work and my dad gets on me again and asks if I deposited the check. I told him no and he seemed annoyed and again told me to deposit the check. Well as you can probably guess the day ends with me again forgetting to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nNow it's today (the 28th) and my mom texts me while I'm at work asking if I deposited the check. I told her no and she must have told dad because he started angrily texting me.\r  \n\r  \n\"I asked you to do something and you didn't do it. I'm so upset with you OP it's not even funny. This is a total disrespect of me and your mom. I asked you to deposit the that check and you didn't. You know we did this because we love you and you turn around and not deposit the check like I asked. I'm so upset. Just give me the check and I'll deposit it in your account if you're that lazy. Ungrateful\"\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked when I read that while at work. And I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. I spent most of my lunch break in tears trying to think of a response. I love my dad a lot but I felt like his anger was out of line and needlessly malicious. Unfortunately, while my dad is loving most of the time he does have bouts of anger like this (like once a year not often at all). He never gets physical or anything but is very loud.\r  \n\r  \nEventually I texted him back saying: \"Hi dad, I'm sorry that this has made you upset. It's not that I'm ungrateful. I guess I just don't understand why this needs to be deposited right away. Especially since it hasn't even been a week since I received your very generous gift. I love you very much and I don't want this to damage our relationship. So I think it's no longer appropriate for me to accept this check. I'll give you the check back when I get home.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought that was the best and most mature way to reply. Maybe he'll calm down?..........No.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHe replied back with this: \"OP when I tell you to do something I want it done. When your mom asks you to do something you do it. Now I want you to deposit that check today or I will disconnect your internet (we live in the same house). I ask for the simplest thing and you cant give that to me. I have my reasons for wanting the check cashed. You should honor my wish. As far as I'm concerned, this has damaged our relationship.\"\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI've since deposited the check like he asked, but I'm really confused am I really in the wrong here or is he blowing this out of proportion?", "created_utc": 1703813560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18taniq/aita_for_not_depositing_my_christmas_check/", "score": 1359, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds a whole lot like ADHD-PI to me.\n\nLeaning toward YTA.", "I don't know about y'all, but their insistence on this is raising some red flags. If they've got a checking account,  why didn't they wire the money? Or withdraw it and give it to them as cash? Something seems off about this.", "Can't people figure out a checking account anymore?  I know exactly what's in my account because I still keep a physical record.  My total, in the log, is what I have. Doesn't matter what the bank says--transactions may well still need to clear.  I've already accounted for those in my  records.  I worked in banking years ago and all-too-frequently had to remind customers that the bank balance is not necesary your actual balance.

Until it's in your account, you can't use it either.\n\nBut I'm not sure I'd spend the money.  I can see in a few weeks or months, your dad will use that money to control you ie we gave you that money so you need to do X, Y and Z, or they want a say in something... because they gave you that money.  If that starts happening you can turn around and say that you can give them that money right back if they want to play that game.  I sense issues with this money in the future so I simply would leave it in an easily accessible high interest account where you can keep the interest (ie don't tell your dad) and give him back the principle if he wants to play controlling games.\n\nI'm someone that would need to go to an ATM to put a cheque into my account as I don't have my banks app (well I tried but it wouldn't work on my phone and it's not the end of the world that I don't have it). \n\nI did find a cheque that my MIL had given my husband about 3 years ago in my wallet the other day (clearly I don't open that part of it often either) but I'm not depositing it... she may not realise I never banked it and she'll wonder what the money is that has come out... not worth it (the story is much longer than that though so it's not that simple).  So the only person that missed out there was me.  The money never came out of her account, same as the money doesn't come out of your dad's account till the cheque is deposited... unless it's a bank cheque.

I wasn't expecting it and they never spend this much on gifts so it took me by surprise. Not to give exact numbers but it was four digits. I was very grateful and thanked them for there generous gift.\r  \n\r  \nEverything was great......until the day after Christmas. My dad would come up to me multiple times and asked if I deposited the check. I told him that I would and that I could deposit it through by banking app. Well the day goes on and I forget to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nThe 27th comes along and I get home from work and my dad gets on me again and asks if I deposited the check. I told him no and he seemed annoyed and again told me to deposit the check. Well as you can probably guess the day ends with me again forgetting to deposit the check.\r  \n\r  \nNow it's today (the 28th) and my mom texts me while I'm at work asking if I deposited the check. I told her no and she must have told dad because he started angrily texting me.\r  \n\r  \n\"I asked you to do something and you didn't do it. I'm so upset with you OP it's not even funny. This is a total disrespect of me and your mom. I asked you to deposit the that check and you didn't. You know we did this because we love you and you turn around and not deposit the check like I asked. I'm so upset. Just give me the check and I'll deposit it in your account if you're that lazy. Ungrateful\"\r  \n\r  \nI was shocked when I read that while at work. And I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. I spent most of my lunch break in tears trying to think of a response. I love my dad a lot but I felt like his anger was out of line and needlessly malicious. Unfortunately, while my dad is loving most of the time he does have bouts of anger like this (like once a year not often at all). He never gets physical or anything but is very loud.\r  \n\r  \nEventually I texted him back saying: \"Hi dad, I'm sorry that this has made you upset. It's not that I'm ungrateful. I guess I just don't understand why this needs to be deposited right away. Especially since it hasn't even been a week since I received your very generous gift. I love you very much and I don't want this to damage our relationship. So I think it's no longer appropriate for me to accept this check. I'll give you the check back when I get home.\"\r  \n\r  \nI thought that was the best and most mature way to reply. Maybe he'll calm down?..........No.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHe replied back with this: \"OP when I tell you to do something I want it done. When your mom asks you to do something you do it.

I have my reasons for wanting the check cashed. You should honor my wish.

No need for dad to act like that.", "Soft YTA, and I mean very soft.\n\nYou sound a bit ADHD ish, which I totally get, but there are a number of reasons why someone would flip if a large check isn\u2019t deposited right away.\n\n1. Overdrafting, especially if it\u2019s a significant amount comparative to income. A lot of bills come out at the first of the month/end of the month automatically. What might be there that day might not be available in a week and the longer it takes to cash the longer they have to keep the account aboveboard to cover it.\n\n2. Taxes. Especially after Christmas season when they\u2019re looking at \u201cgifts\u201d to appear that are taxable in accounts. \n\n3. Security. If I gave someone four figures in a check form, I\u2019d absolutely lose my ever loving mind if they lost it and that money disappeared because they simply\u2026didn\u2019t deposit. You\u2019re holding a significant sum of money that can be stolen, \ndropped, or lost very easily.\n\n4. Deposit cut off. (I\u2019m not 100% on this since I\u2019ve only encountered it once and it was work related so take this one worth a grain of salt) Checks, depending on bank to bank region or credit to credit region, have an expiration date on when they can be deposited. If a check isn\u2019t deposited within a certain time frame that check can be automatically cancelled by the bank. If you are a bit ADHD and your parents know this, that could explain why they\u2019re flipping out since that becomes a whole pain in the butt process in the future. I, personally, didn\u2019t know this was a thing until I came back from LOA and tried to deposit a check from over two months prior and got told off when a new one had to be made.\n\n4. The way it comes off. Anytime you gift someone money, especially large bits of money, there\u2019s a low key expectation of gratefulness for it no matter how stupid that sounds. When you\u2019re forgetful about depositing a check that was gifted, it can come off as you really don\u2019t give a flying eff about the money that they gave you. Though I\u2019ve seen that more with the 45 and older crowd with a hit and miss attitude about it in the 30+ crowd. \n\nAnywho, could be a lot of reasons why he\u2019s losing his mind, however threatening to cut off the internet is a bit extreme. If he\u2019s absolutely that stressed about it, it should have been a \u201chey, I need you to stop what you\u2019re doing and deposit this right now for x,y,z reasons\u201d. Then, if you had refused entirely and blew them off again. That would have been the YTA. Right now, it\u2019s seems like every made some less than stellar decisions and had equally less than stellar reactions", "NTA. Your dad's controlling, bottom line. A gift is a gift, it's not his anymore. It's been less than a week and the one time he checks his account in that time (normally) he can just remember $1k less overall. This reaction he is having is temper tantrum worry. My only real guess is he didn't want to give it in the first place and is now stewing over it. Also just deposit the damn thing, I'm sure you've driven past your bank 3 times already.", "Tbh my dad would be the same way and it is largely because he would be mad at me for not \u201caccepting\u201d the gift. Like there\u2019s an element of giving money that is different than opening a physical present and if you don\u2019t deposit it right away, then it\u2019s like leaving the gift behind. Sure they also could need that taken out immediately for tax or budgeting purposes, but I would honestly feel like it\u2019s more likely he\u2019s just upset that you didn\u2019t \u201ctake your present home\u201d.", "NTA. I fully understand wanting to make sure that it gets deposited so that the money for the check isn't sitting in his own account (it sucks to think you have more money than you actually do because a payment you issued is taking longer than expected to process), but if he's REALLY that concerned about it he should have withdrawn the amount and given you cash instead of writing a check. There's no reason to blow up like that TWO DAYS after Chrsitmas at someone you're giving a gift to.

I opened the first savings account at five on a school field trip, got a checking account with dad as the second person on it when I was 12/13 and traveling abroad with a student group and he thought it was better for me to have an atm card than travelers checks, my parents supported me in college and insisted my first job was school and I could only work secondary to that (I have amazing parents), it made sense to keep dad on the account when I moved abroad for grad school because he could handle anything that came up or give me cash in an emergency, and finally I left grad school sick, broken, and unable to care for myself which eventually settled of a sorts to me being unable to work and unable to live alone, so my mom is still on my account. I also live with her. I had them give me z four figure check for Christmas one year and there was not harassment to get it deposit, and this was before you could just snap a pic of it. \nGod I feel old.", "The dad is probably worried about loss or theft.

YTA, but not a bad person because your dad didn't explain why it was important to him.", "I think it's hilarious how many are commenting Y T A because you didn't magically understand an urgency that was never communicated to you. Depending on your finances, I might have even replied \"I'm not depositing it, I'm framing it! Thanks so much <3\"\n\nYour dad is being immature and doesn't know how to communicate. Simple as that.

Not cashing an unusually large and generous check is insulting. You may not have meant it that way, but it definitely comes across as like you didn't care that much about the gift.

The reason people get annoyed by that is because the money stays in their account balance which makes it hard for them to balance their checkbooks at the end of the month.

I was surprised that your dad got so irate after just a couple of days and think it definitely points towards there being another reasons as to why he wanted the cheque cashed immediately.
