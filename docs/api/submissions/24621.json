It sounds like he\u2019s trying to condition you to accept that what he did was fine and what you did wasn\u2019t.  He ate 2/3 of something that wasn\u2019t his.  Usually when people are offered to help themselves, they make an effort to be polite about it.  In my household this would be seen as him taking your food 4 times - a second portion is not guaranteed, and at the very least should be asked for.  As others have mentioned, taking the *last* portion is a big deal!  Very selfish, very rude, and VERY \u201cweird around food\u201d.\n\nAccording to your edit you had already spoken to him about not eating the last portion of something.

What you should\u2019ve said was \u201chelp yourself, but I would really like at least half (or whatever amount you wanted)\u201d. And if you say help yourself it\u2019s not a contract and he shouldn\u2019t have to figure out if that \u201ccontract\u201d ends after midnight that day. If my wife told me help yourself, which she does, I help myself to what I want. If there are left overs, I eat more if I want.

I ordered a pizza for myself and told him to \"help himself.\" He took this to mean eating 2 slices that night and taking the remaining 3 to work - leaving me without my leftovers I had planned on eating for lunch.

Worked a desk. OTOH, I'm 6'2 and 220 ish. Not fat but definitely eats pasta body. At the time I had a physical job, in that I had to walk all over a building that was probably half a mile of walking if you stuck to the main corridor. Putting in 5-10 miles per day of walking wasn't rare. I try to keep up on weights to match cardio.\n\nShe thought food should be 50/50. She always cooked exactly double what she ate. Doubling the ingredients was pretty easy mentally as well.\n\nI didn't eat double what she did, but at least an additional half extra of what she did. So I did my cooking and cooked lots extra for when she wanted me to eat a third to half less than normal. Not sure if I'm the weirdo, but I also cook lots extra to pack up as leftovers. Think lazy meal prep. I never took more than half the food she made, I just did loads of extra cooking. Which she generally liked and often took for lunch.\n\nShe got it, but never fully \"got it\" and would be hurt if I snagged an extra portion of something I made after she cooked a meal.

I didn't read the whole post lol", "About 9 months prior to lasagne-gate (as we now call it!), I was 100 lbs heavier and ate food like it was going out of fashion. I can absolutely assure you that I wasn't serving meagre portions. In fact, these were *gigantic* portions, stuffed full of bechamel, chunks of mozzarella, ragu and pasta.\n\nI made this lasagne as a treat to myself for the weight loss and I'm pretty sure the 2 portions he ate per sitting would've been 4 portions for me! I vaguely recall chopping them in half, so I expect I was eating half for a meal because they were so massive. My memory has faded over time and due to lack of available brain space for minutiae!\n\nEffectively, he ate 4 portions at the size I would now eat as a normal-BMI woman. He only made it through the initial 2 giant portions with a weed break, and then groaned about how full he was for hours afterwards. It wasn't a small portion thing, I am entirely sure \u2013 more like an 'eyes bigger than stomach' thing.", "It's sad you should have to say that though.

Which is a bad thing. Because it takes 2 hours to make and people always ask me to make it for any holiday. Can't do fennel properly without simmering for hour, hour and a half. It's also expensive. For one person, that's like five to eight meals. \n\nOn the plus side, my mom threw out her recipe in favor of mine. Which considering how Italian my mom's side is, that's a hell of a compliment."]}
