He shall be destroyed!", "My process is to hug myself tightly, rock back and forth and dribble while staring at the food as it cooks. Is this not how everyone else does it?", "What about the part where OP had already asked for him to check-in with her before eating the last of anything because he had done this several times before and not replaced what he'd taken?

Easiest way to get around this.", "The part that tipped me away from your side on this one is that you described him as a vacuum for Italian food lol. If I had that knowledge going in, I may have played it safe.\n\nI also 100% would have been upset if I were you, too. I probably would have asked what he was making for me to even the scales.", "I think I might have broken up with that guy for what he did. Wars have been started for less!", "Kind of a grey area, TBH! It wasn't as though we had discussions over whether meals were or weren't shared. If I made something he liked, I'd offer him some. I really enjoyed cooking for us both previously, but went on a health kick and stopped doing this, so it was 'fend for yourself' at the time.", "Hmm! Good questions! I had bought all the ingredients and, if making shared meals, I'd ask him to pay half, which I didn't do. We were each cooking for ourselves individually at the time, so it could be implied that it was 'mine'. However, I wouldn't ever have made his fave food and then eaten all of it without giving him half, so I expect he could reasonably have assumed it was for us both.", "LMAO, yes, protect all Italian food, ye who enter our house! I suspect if I'd left the house for a couple of days, 100% of it would've been devoured by him! On the plus side, he really enjoyed it.", "You're not wrong in anything you did. Could more have been done to prevent it? Yes. But based on what you described he should have known. He did wrong, you did not. \nBut as far as leftovers go, I'm always on the side of communicating and labeling even if it should be obvious. Hungry people will eat without thinking, especially some good food."]}
