She stopped paying rent a year and a half ago, and her landlord recently won in court, resulting in the police evicting her on Monday ( we heard it through our door). \n\nOn Wednesday I went out with my bf and we noticed she was outside asking people for a ladder because \u201cshe forgot hey keys and she needs to go back to her apartment through the window\u201d. She saw us leaving, and when we came back she was laying in the hallway and told us she managed to find someone who can break the door lock ( put there by the police). \n\nThe next day I noticed my bike went missing from our common bike parking which is usually locked by key. It was the only one missing even though there were more expensive ones. I asked my neighbours if they noticed anything weird and one of them said that when he came back home yesterday the parking door was wide open. We went to dinner at 7:30, our neighbour came back home at 9.

You have footage of that? I am sorry your bike was stolen, if you want to call the police about that do it. It has nothing to do with your homeless mentally ill ex neighbor."]}
