She stopped paying rent a year and a half ago, and her landlord recently won in court, resulting in the police evicting her on Monday ( we heard it through our door). \n\nOn Wednesday I went out with my bf and we noticed she was outside asking people for a ladder because \u201cshe forgot hey keys and she needs to go back to her apartment through the window\u201d. She saw us leaving, and when we came back she was laying in the hallway and told us she managed to find someone who can break the door lock ( put there by the police). \n\nThe next day I noticed my bike went missing from our common bike parking which is usually locked by key. It was the only one missing even though there were more expensive ones. I asked my neighbours if they noticed anything weird and one of them said that when he came back home yesterday the parking door was wide open. We went to dinner at 7:30, our neighbour came back home at 9.

The building management should also be informed to secure the property.", "NTA. You need to file a police report on the theft regardless and not sure if you have renters insurance or not, but if you do, they may pay a portion for a replacement bike due to the theft but they'll want the police report. Whether or not the police speak to your neighbor about the bike remains to be seen but file the report.\n\nAnd someone needs to let the landlord know about her breaking in. That's illegal on it's own (and now she's squatting??) and needs to be dealt with.", "My neighbour was legally obligated to give all her keys to the police on Monday, meaning that the fact she kept a double for the parking is illegal.\nThe parking is also common private property and if someone who is not a resident has access to it means they broke in. \n\nAlso, if the police finds out she came back they will definitely do something about it. Even the eviction on Monday was quite violent.", "Outta curiosity, where do you live that the police would help the neighbor?", "The building manager has been informed and he will fortunately change the locks next month.", "Thank you that\u2019s a very good point, I will definitely check that out!\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t think the landlord can do anything for now. The apartment is handled by the police for a month and my evicted neighbour was supposed to tell them a date when she could come back to take her stuff. But instead she broke in and it looks like she barricaded the door. We also know at least one of the cats is back. I\u2019m not gonna lie I\u2019m a bit weary of her, she\u2019s quite creepy and she used to shout at her cats like crazy..", "Police for stolen bike.

YWTA if you did that.", "I\u2019d like to file a report for my missing bike. But since the theft is linked to the open door and the person who left it open ( which I would have to specify in the report), it would indeed mean I called the police on my ex-neighbour.

You have footage of that? I am sorry your bike was stolen, if you want to call the police about that do it. It has nothing to do with your homeless mentally ill ex neighbor.", "NTA.\n\nCall the police, because she's just going to continue to create havoc until she is stopped.\n\nHer saying she \"doesn't really care what's in there\" is a tip-off.

However, it\u2019s not what I am currently asking. My question is:\n\nWould I be the asshole if I filed a report for my stolen bike which would result in the eviction of a person who: broke into a parking she was not allowed into and an apartment which is not hers, has caused financial damage to everyone in the building (since we will al pay for the lock change) and could\u2019ve caused a lot more damage because the parking contains some expensive bikes, keeps animals in an insalubrious environment and has refused to seek help from any of the numerous organisations that offer assistance to people in her condition because she is in denial and wants this apartment because \u201cit\u2019s in a good area\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s big\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m asking this because I obviously don\u2019t want to destroy even more the life of someone who is already down.

Your bike was stolen, make a report about that.\n\nWhy do you have to bring your ex neighbor into ?", "NTA.\n\nYour neighbor has already been evicted, so she's trespassing. Someone needs to let management know she's hanging around so that they can have removed from the property.

You don\u2019t know exactly what happened but if she flat out told you she left the door open you can tell the police that.", "NTA she's already homeless. in all honesty the police will probably get her help. make sure they know she's tried to break in and make sure the landlord knows what she's doing.", "NTA\n\nI would definitely call the police and inform the landlord about the situation. I honestly don't know if anything will be done about it, but it's worth a try.", "NTA\n\nBut the cops will probably do nothing about a stolen bike", "NTA. I\u2019d report it to the police, and let them know the neighbor was present.  Then they can pursue questioning her and what happens, happens.  Do you have renters insurance, that you could file a claim?", "Nta but honestly getting social services involved instead of the police is probably better. Police won\u2019t care about a pushbike, I think that might just be an unfortunate loss.", "she's also trying to break into the building itself via a ladder or breaking the lock.without the bike issue the police should still be informed, they can get her help", "But isn't the issue of her attempting to break in and/or trespassing an issue for the landlord?  Not you?\n\nThe landlord has the authority to tell the police she is trespassing.  The police can then escort her off the property, and if she continues to keep coming back, she can be cited for it. Unfortunately, you have no such authority. \n\nDoes she need help?  Most likely.  But are the police the best option to give her that help?  Probably not.", "and in parts of the US, they can contact social workers and the like to help her out, direct her towards aid societies and the like and social services", "according to OP she was mentally unstable and it was a violent eviction. if you lived there and there is a mentally unstable person hanging around who shouldn't be there, do you want to take steps to protect the community or just wait for someone else to do it and hope she doesn't do anything too odd until someone else acts.?", "This is definitely the landlord's problem. She has been trespassing since she was evicted and for all the neighbors who've seen her since not to report it to the landlord astounds me.", "Do you have an insurance which includes that bike and reporting a theft makes it easier to get money from your insurance? I mean you won't get money from that neighbor, because she clearly has none. \n\nIf you have no insurance I would just report it to your landlord that she is back and what she has done. Going to the police sounds like a waste of time in this case."]}
