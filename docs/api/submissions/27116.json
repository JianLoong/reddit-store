No he doesn't have to honor his mother. He made his vows to you and not her.

To make sure she will always be his number one. This is incredibly toxic. He needs to realize his mother would never allow him to be happy with any woman at all, not just OP. He could bring home the most wonderful partner and his mother would treat her just like OP. She's a very toxic mother who views her son as her property.\n\nGo to counseling, you first and bring him in later as a couple.

Please, please talk with a therapist about what lead you to keep her with you for all that time making you miserable, or you could end up spending the rest of your life with similar misery and without the resources to fix it.\n\nSecond, why do you feel like a villain for not allowing a person who constantly belittles and makes your life hellish you to live with you?  Do you not deserve the sanctuary of peace you desire?\n\nThird, what's going on with your husband?  Did he not see how his mother treated you?  Does he not care about your happiness?  Is it OK with him for you to be bullied and put down constantly?\n\nEither way, it might make sense to let him know that if his mother comes, you go.  Or, better still, if he wants to put up his mother, let him find a place where he can live with her, and you stay in your house.

And you don't want an abusive person in it. His mommy is not his wife. If he wants to help by finding her a place in her budget, he can.

I understand you love her but if you love me you would not place ne back into a abusive situation in my OWN home to assuage your own guilt.\n\nYou saying I am strong enough to handle being abused. That because you are not willing to take a stand and protect me from YOUR mother. Shows you care about her more. That you think its ok for her to treat me like she has. If not you would grow a spine and never allow it to happen.\n\nBut if you allow her back in this home then I will know you are putting her first. You are choosing her and this is not a guilt trip. Just truth. Your actions will have consequences. \n\nI do not sleep with or have sex with someone that allows me to be abused. That is married to his mother and places her wants above my needs. I will not be with someone who expects me to suck it up. What happens when we have kids. Will she get to raise them? Will she get to treat me like this in front of them? Are you OK telling me to suck it up and teach them abuse is ok and to expect it? What about if she turns it on them?\n\nI am sorry but if she steps foot back in a house I call home then I am done. You can go screw mommy because I am done and will be leaving. Telling me to accept abusive behavior is being abusive as well and I deserve to have someone love me enough to salt the earth to keep me safe from anyone hurting me. My future children deserve to have a father that shows love and will  protect them from anything and you have proven your love, fear, and no backbone to stand up to your mother means you are not that man. I love you but I love myself more. \n\n\n\nBut thats me. I would walk no matter how much you love him and your life. Because he is willing to put you back in an abusive situation. Love is not enough to survive that. And kids. Tou say your not confrontational but it's time to be. Because you are chancing having a child that either will see the abuse or be  abused. Are you really willing to allow your child that? Hun it's past time for therapy only. It's therapy and her not moving in. Or stepping foot back in what should be your safe space or it's time to go stay with friends or family. If you are not willing to take a stand then he won't change his mind. He won't do anything because you are easier to manipulate to have her stop coming at him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
