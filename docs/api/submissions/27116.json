Just truth. Your actions will have consequences. \n\nI do not sleep with or have sex with someone that allows me to be abused. That is married to his mother and places her wants above my needs.

Are you OK telling me to suck it up and teach them abuse is ok and to expect it? What about if she turns it on them?\n\nI am sorry but if she steps foot back in a house I call home then I am done. You can go screw mommy because I am done and will be leaving. Telling me to accept abusive behavior is being abusive as well and I deserve to have someone love me enough to salt the earth to keep me safe from anyone hurting me. My future children deserve to have a father that shows love and will  protect them from anything and you have proven your love, fear, and no backbone to stand up to your mother means you are not that man. I love you but I love myself more. \n\n\n\nBut thats me. I would walk no matter how much you love him and your life. Because he is willing to put you back in an abusive situation. Love is not enough to survive that. And kids. Tou say your not confrontational but it's time to be. Because you are chancing having a child that either will see the abuse or be  abused. Are you really willing to allow your child that? Hun it's past time for therapy only. It's therapy and her not moving in. Or stepping foot back in what should be your safe space or it's time to go stay with friends or family. If you are not willing to take a stand then he won't change his mind.
