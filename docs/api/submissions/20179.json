Actually you seem like the one sabotaging her child's future by getting pregnant by a guy you haven't been with long and who you know has a lot of family money. His family sees right through you.

Know your audience, if they were chastising your bf over what you believe is a very gentle approach in the divorce, imagine if the new partner throws in something like that (even if it is true)? \n\nA divorce is messy, but not just for the partners but everyone involved, which also means they are dealing with a lot of emotions and history. It seems they are very fond of her, I don't know the grounds for their divorce, but if they still love her and have a lot of history, they will get defensive when you throw around things like that.\n\nYour bf is already dealing with a divorce, which is crazy difficult and demanding, to then have to deal with his parents and with you getting in there... Of course he doesn't want to have that as well.\n\nSo, you did something stupid, it's best to stay clear of making those remarks around the family and let the lawyers settle the divorce. \n\nAs for the sister, different story I think, might be misconstrued?

I don't see how they expected it to go good, if they knew it'd go down tge route they took it (divorce etc).\n\n\nI honestly am kind of shocked, presuming the divorce, like you said, is going in her favour financially, that she's got your partner's family essentially trying to create worse conditions for him.\n\n\nI do think your partner could be right about leaving the topic alone, but he shouldn't be mad at you for your opinion like that.
