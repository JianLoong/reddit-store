It seems they are very fond of her, I don't know the grounds for their divorce, but if they still love her and have a lot of history, they will get defensive when you throw around things like that.\n\nYour bf is already dealing with a divorce, which is crazy difficult and demanding, to then have to deal with his parents and with you getting in there... Of course he doesn't want to have that as well.\n\nSo, you did something stupid, it's best to stay clear of making those remarks around the family and let the lawyers settle the divorce. \n\nAs for the sister, different story I think, might be misconstrued?

I don't see how they expected it to go good, if they knew it'd go down tge route they took it (divorce etc).\n\n\nI honestly am kind of shocked, presuming the divorce, like you said, is going in her favour financially, that she's got your partner's family essentially trying to create worse conditions for him.\n\n\nI do think your partner could be right about leaving the topic alone, but he shouldn't be mad at you for your opinion like that.

OP never said how long she\u2019s been dating him. I\u2019m guessing more than six months, which would explain why things didn\u2019t work out.", "They're divorcing because she found out he did coke a few times and freaked the fuck out over it and said she didn't want him/his \"druggy\" friends around her son.  \n\nI know that. They're always on her side. It's been like that their whole relationship.", "OP wants wife and son to disappear like they never happened. I bet she weaponizes her pregnancy and baby to keep him from his son in the future.", "Yes. Maybe bf and ex had a toxic relationship, but the timeline does not help OP\u2019s story", "Ultimately you've made the decision to have a baby with someone who is in the middle of a divorce; you must have realised this would be messy.", "Agreed. YTA. Ex-wife has every right to put up a fight to get the financial support she needs to support their son. New girl is just worried this man won\u2019t be able to provide much for her own baby if the ex gets more financial support.", "Also, OP was vague on details, but since he has a son with his ex wife who he was married to for 2 years, that makes me wonder if the son is very young. Is the behavior OP\u2019s complaining about, the ex relying on his money, maybe perhaps because she\u2019s been staying at home with a baby?", "Agreed", "In most US States, the couple has to have been married for 7 years before the wife is \"entitled\" to half. That's also assuming that she was not working while they were married. If she was, that would be taken into account as well and it wouldn't be half of his stuff, especially after only 2 years of marriage.", "I laughed at \u201cnot the asshole, just stupid\u201d way to hard", "Divorce isn't final so they are talking about their daughter-in-law and mother of their grandchild.", "Probably because she only knows his side of things, not the whole story. Who knows if he's being honest with her about what happened", "They are not insensitive they are proving a point. They don\u2019t like op!

That sounds far fetched.", "He\u2019s still married to her, right? \n\nHow would you characterize your relationship with a man who is married to someone else?", "You're pregnant and he's married. How is it that he didn't cheat exactly? Is it someone else's baby?", "He is married. Literally right now at this moment he is married. He may have decided he doesn\u2019t want to be, but he is married. You are pregnant with his kid. That means you slept with a married man.", "EGG-ZACKLY!!! Sounds like she wants wife and son to just go away so she can have the life they had. I can't imagine what the family thinks of her. They probably think she got knocked up on purpose.", "I would love a little back story, but, you're right, she's probably not going to respond.", "I have a feeling she doesn't even know some of the answers, she is either incredibly naive or completely selfish. Maybe both. Yikes!", "And she\u2019s pregnant too. Certainly didn\u2019t waste any time. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ve had an affair and that\u2019s why wife is playing hardball and rightly so if that\u2019s the case.", "What kind of terrible mother doesn\u2019t want illegal drugs around her child?", "Open your eyes. His family is on her side. He told you not to talk negatively about her. It doesn\u2019t sound like he talks negatively about her. He continues to give her money for whatever she needs and wants. They\u2019re divorcing not because they\u2019re no longer in love or because he wants to be with you, but because of his drug use which has since stopped. I think if his wife opened the door to reconciliation, he would take her up on it. I hope she doesn\u2019t take him back for their son\u2019s sake but it\u2019s a very real possibility. I hope you have a back up plan in case this doesn\u2019t work out.", "\"They're always on her side.\"\n\nMaybe because only one of them is a drug user....", "Guess who will be invited to Christmas?

It\u2019s pretty impressive, ngl.", "You are rightly talking from a legal perspective. I'm talking about a moral perspective considering the trash she married. I should have clarified", "But he certainly will owe child support.", "Yep but he is wrong she is the asshole! \n\nBut give the person props that comment takes the internet today!", "Right the way OP refers to the child as \u201cher son\u201d or \u201cthe kid\u201d just shows she doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge the kid is his.  Totally glances over the fact it\u2019s not just \u201cher son\u201d it\u2019s her boyfriends son as well.", "Fully gather, probably poor wording on my part, it's more so the part about blaming OP's partner in front of her about the divorce settlement if things like OP said are at least fair to the ex wife, that seem like the stupid part to me anyway.", "You have a point on that tbh. I think the main thing here would be to leave the topic alone though for OP, so she's not getting roped into arguments with her partner's family.", "Been dating since teens, someone\u2019s money hungry and it\u2019s not the ex-wife", "Yep if it walks like a side piece and it talke like a side piece it\u2019s definitely is the side piece!", "I\u2019m thinking this too", "Valid, seems like the type, but\n\nthe blame for cheating is still on the cheater and no one else.", "haha, done", "Thanks! Missed it even after I went back a few times!", "Thanks! Missed it 3x!", "OP just added that the husband does coke and the not-yet-ex wife doesn't want him and his coke buddies around their kid. Op really tries to act like the wife is in the wrong when the wife is the only sensible, mature one. No wonder his family still loves her lol", "Yeah, I was friendly with her too before this", "He doesn't anymore but he was seeing other people before.", "I don't think OP has ever considered that her boyfriends (possible) future ex-wife and first child are not going away. It's not like \"divorce papers signed/ex-wife and child disappear\". There will be family events, holidays, and of course child support over the coming years. OP: you're not married, or even engaged - what makes you think you have any right whatsoever to weigh in on what your boyfriend and his wife work out? Have you ever considered that he is the one slowing it down because he doesn't actually want a divorce?", "I honestly think that's a real possibility.  She strikes me as the type to make herself known to the wife to force the hand of the guy.", "Me too \ud83d\ude02", "Especially because if the son OP references was born while they were married, she might have just been out of work on maternity leave/taking care of the baby.", "I know right! Next they will be upset because she doesn\u2019t want him to play in traffic!", "The drugs were never around her child she just made it into a bigger thing than it needed to be instead of handling it like an adult", "Yeeeep. Boyfriend was the bad guy in the marriage and he (and his family) knows it.", "It also sounds like she could get more out of him due to the fact he possibly broke their marriage vows and was sleeping around.", "I'm speaking in a legal perspective, because that's what this is, a legal matter.\n\nI've been married and divorced. I'm remarried and have no worries about another divorce. I was married for 5 years and while yes, I could have gotten child support from him, I could not legally go after his financials in any other way, nor could he go after mine. I worked full time, he worked full time. We each had our own 401K. I made almost as much on 40 hours as he did. Therefore, we walked away with our own assets and 50/50 legal and physical custody of our daughter.\n\nMy current marriage has lasted over 14 years. Been together for almost 16.", "Agreed", "Well done!! ^5", "Don\u2019t worry, it took me two or three times, too.

So it still makes sense for her to not want him around their kid, and makes even more sense why his family would side with her in the divorce. And the fact that your bf pretty much defended her by telling you to shut up and never mention her again really tells me that he\u2019s still in love with her and knows he messed up and probably doesn\u2019t really want you.", "She handled it like an adult. You did not.", "How do you think she should have handled it?", "Do you think he was never high in front of his kids? Like they don't have to be visibly seeing him doing drugs for it to be a big ass issue and divorce worthy. And instead of improving himself and showing her he could be better he gets his rebound pregnant? Like, that's a wee bit of a yikes. It might even be a yikes on bikes", "My opinion's not the most popular on this I guess, but I stand by the point.", "No", "You can understand though, that someone on drugs isn't necessarily capable of making good choices?\n\nYou said his kid wasn't around that you knew of,  but what happens if it becomes a habit? What happens if he gets addicted? What happens if he does it while he's supposed to be watching *your baby?*  \n\nNot to mention,  what happens if he gets caught and goes to jail? What happens if he has to serve time and loses his job? Or has to pay a fine,  and it's enough to compromise your finances? Or he got caught while driving and now the cars impounded and you can't get to work/ the Dr's office/ etc. \n\nHis wife has very valid reasons to expect him not to do drugs. It's not uncommon for that to be a deal breaker. It should make you uncomfortable OP. That road doesn't lead anywhere good.", "He stopped after she found out and he won't do it again because she said she would keep their son away from him if she ever found out he did it again so I know he won't risk it as he loves his son very much. He wouldn't do it around our baby or his son. It was a thing he did at parties and it was never something he did regularly.", "Except it sounds like it happened more than once if she's divorcing him. \n\nOP, I'm concerned that you're going into this relationship with the blinders on. You're still in the honeymoon phase. Your man can do no wrong.  You have a child on the way.  You need to take a step back and look objectively at this guy.", "My dad said the same shit to my mom. Want to guess what my sister found in his nightstand after they got divorced?", "Are you sure that's all? I can hardly believe someone who's been dating since they were teenagers would divorce their partner because they did coke a couple times. It sounds like that's not all he did.", "Isn\u2019t it interesting how in the post it\u2019s her/the son but it\u2019s actually his son lol", "Yeah, my kid\u2019s bio \u201cdad\u201d swore himself blue in the face that he\u2019d never touch drugs again because he wanted to be in his child\u2019s life. Then he disappeared for several months until he called to say that he\u2019d just gotten out of jail again for another drug charge.", "[removed]"]}
