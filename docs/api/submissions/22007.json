I'm not on social media often, but I had family and close friends reach out to me asking if she was already dating and shocked she's moved on so quickly.

Maybe she\u2019s still in shock. \n\nIn any case, you did not approach her with concern and empathy you came with \u201camoral\u201d and \u201coptics\u201d and so you are the asshole.", "So, pulling the plug was the right decision at the time, but now that she\u2019s dating it was sus?  YTA", "Dude.  So YTA.  Not your business.", "YTA. Some widows do move on quickly. You have no way to know if she was cheating. Maybe this is how she's coping with something so devastating. It was pretty inappropriate\u00a0of you to say meeting/posting someone so soon after \"pulling the plug\" was \"terrible optics.\" Mind your business and give her an apology", "YTA.  Your opinion about a situation that has nothing to do with you is not the \u201ctruth\u201d", ">I work in Sales, so I'm not a total dummy regarding delicate communications.\n\nIf you say so. \n\n> the fact she's moved on so quickly are in poor decorum and amoral.\n\nTotally delicate.\n\nYTA.", "YTA and it's really hard to see how anyone could say otherwise. \"Hey, you know how you're finding joy and rebuilding your life after a horrible traumatic experience? It looks AWFUL so stop.\"", "YTA. It is absolutely nobody's business but hers.  Until you're in her position, you have no idea what you'll do, how you'll process and grieve, etc. \n\nYou overstepped.  There was no reason for you to bring it up, at all.", "Curious, as you've mentioned not being close, had she spoke to you about how she's doing with her loss? How her inlaws relationship with her is going since the loss of their son / uncle / nephew?\n\nBecause I'm wondering if anger and resentment could be pushing some of what you're seeing. Your sister may have told her husband to put on a seat belt and he blew her off, she might have anger mixed in to her grief if she feels he could still be alive if he'd just done what she'd asked. If her inlaws are taking his death hard, could they be blaming her as the other person in the car for not doing more to push for their kid being safe? In this light could she be functionally acting as if she'd broken up with her husband rather than that he's passed away from a tragic accident? The anger could be staving off crushing grief and for now that's where she needs to be to survive.\n\nThis is all supposition, but it's supposition that gives benefit of the doubt, that gives kindness. It's complete and utter arm chair therapist guesswork without all the facts. \n\nYour supposition was to belive she was doing wrong, and that's the space you met her in with your questions and comments. She might be 100% unfazed by her husbands death and moving on to greener pastures. At no point did her actions require commentary from you or \"gentle\" guilting / reprimand of her to do what YOU think is the right thing, the correct optics thing. \n\nYTA", "YTA- who puts rules on how someone Grieves and gets over grief? That wasn't your place to say anything. You should really apologize to your sister.", "YTA.   You don't get to decide how other people grieve.  You don't get to decide what is/is not 'too soon' for another person.  And you most certainly are not the Arbiter of What Is Appropriate for anyone other than yourself.     \n\n\nAlso, those people who 'reached out' to you to talk about her Facebook posts?  They ARE both gossips and haters, as they specifically reached out to you (and heaven knows how many other people) to make sure you were aware that your sister was dating and that they felt it was too soon.   That's gossip and hatred.", "YTA \n\nImagine being the older \u201cmore mature\u201d sibling and still believing you get to bully a widow about the way she grieves and moves forward with her life all while it has literally 0 meaningful impact on your life.", "YTA.\n\nA 29 year old widow is finding her path to move on in life and you are worried about \n\noptics and decorum. \nWTF.\n\nPlus who says you know the truth of her new relationship...\n...or her old one for that matter?\n\nMind your business.", "I have to be honest... I'm kinda stunned at all the you're the assholes verdicts here.\n\nI was thinking more NAH?\n\nDude, OP's right. It's not a great look. You know other people were thinking it. You're just the one who said it first.\n\nOn the other hand, people do grieve differently. So can I truly blame your sister? No. Of course not.\n\nAnyway, I'll probably get downvoted to hell and back but if it were my sister my eyebrows would be raised too.", "yta, you're a horrible insufferable person, the fact that you got upset that everyone didnt start bullying a widow for having a new relationship is disturbing to me, you clearly have this attitude about everyones personal affairs not just this one situation.", "YTA how could you possibly think this was your place?", "YTA\n\n *YOU* are the one who lacks \"decorum\" and is \"amoral\".\n\n*You* do not get to dictate how anyone grieves.

You're passing judgment on someone you don't really know.", "YTA it\u2019s just none of your business", "As someone widowed very young, YTA. \nShe's grieving, she may well need help processing that. On top of that,  she's probably v.worried/scared of the financial / logistical implications of her loss. \nBut instead of voicing concern or offering support, you offered judgement. Sooooo many other ways you could have handled this conversation.", "Everyone knows she was to wear black for a year and not be seen in public until her mourning period was over so it's a good thing you said something.\n\nJust kidding, YTA.", "Baffled by the YTAs. She\u2019s posting about a new guy six WEEKS after the memorial???? Yikes. Wow. That\u2019s so tacky but I guess if they don\u2019t have kids then it\u2019s her business.

You\u2019re clearly TERRIBLE at delicate communications! This was absolutely not your business & your wording was crass & insensitive. You said the two of you aren\u2019t even close. Who do you think you are to judge her and confront her that way?\n\nYTA. Definitely.", "YTA", "YTA for trying to shame her now. Giving her a quiet word when she first started posting that it might be a good idea to stay on the downlow for a while out of respect for her husband's family would have been reasonable. Bottling it all up and letting her have it NOW for daring to be happy is really not OK.\n\nYou don't know the truth of people's relationships. Maybe the marriage actually wasn't okay at the point he died. Maybe she has a lot of anger at her husband for leaving her so soon -- sure it was an accident, but he chose not to wear a seatbelt.\n\nThere are no rules for this sort of thing. But men often move on VERY QUICKLY, and don't get nearly the same amount of shaming as widows do for finding someone new.", "YTA on several levels here.  As a widow myself, I can tell you that you likely have no idea what it is like to lose a partner to death.  How your sister processes her grief and all the changes in her life is her business alone.  For sure many are in no way ready for another relationship for a while and most are incredibly lonely.  The loneliness is huge and I'm happy she has some company instead of suffering alone like some expect and like many widows do. Life threw her a curve ball and now it is up to her to survive that and move forward as best she can.  I hope all works out for her.  She doesn't need busybodies gossiping about her. Believe me when I tell you there is NO one way to grieve and you are not privy to what is written on her heart.", "YTA. You're right that it's in poor taste to post the dude on social media so soon. But she had already done it and is still with this guy 6 months later. What does shaming her now accomplish? It's better to just mind your own business.", "Grief is a nebulous, inexplicable thing sometimes. Sometimes it is quiet. Sometimes is loud. Sometimes it seeks attention and company, other it requires immense solitude. Sometimes it just needs to get laid. Sometimes it \\*\\*GASP\\*\\* needs a non-judgmental friend. It is always different for each person. Other people's grief responses are generally none of your god-damned business, even if your are family. Who or what is being harmed here exactly?\n\nIf the answer is your delicate sensibilities, decorum (whatever that actually means in practical terms), or your personal morality, then 100% YTA.\n\nHave the day you deserve. :) What you deserve is up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT. Typos.", "YTA. They were together for 10 and married for 2. But was your half-sister happy? You have no clue what that relationship was like behind closed doors. I\u2019m not saying she was glad that her husband passed, but maybe the relationship wasn\u2019t all that great. Rather than judge her, be happy that she\u2019s adjusted to this horrible tragedy and is making a new path for herself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
