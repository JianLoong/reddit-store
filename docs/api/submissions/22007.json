How her inlaws relationship with her is going since the loss of their son / uncle / nephew?\n\nBecause I'm wondering if anger and resentment could be pushing some of what you're seeing. Your sister may have told her husband to put on a seat belt and he blew her off, she might have anger mixed in to her grief if she feels he could still be alive if he'd just done what she'd asked. If her inlaws are taking his death hard, could they be blaming her as the other person in the car for not doing more to push for their kid being safe? In this light could she be functionally acting as if she'd broken up with her husband rather than that he's passed away from a tragic accident? The anger could be staving off crushing grief and for now that's where she needs to be to survive.\n\nThis is all supposition, but it's supposition that gives benefit of the doubt, that gives kindness. It's complete and utter arm chair therapist guesswork without all the facts. \n\nYour supposition was to belive she was doing wrong, and that's the space you met her in with your questions and comments. She might be 100% unfazed by her husbands death and moving on to greener pastures.

They ARE both gossips and haters, as they specifically reached out to you (and heaven knows how many other people) to make sure you were aware that your sister was dating and that they felt it was too soon.

Maybe the marriage actually wasn't okay at the point he died. Maybe she has a lot of anger at her husband for leaving her so soon -- sure it was an accident, but he chose not to wear a seatbelt.\n\nThere are no rules for this sort of thing. But men often move on VERY QUICKLY, and don't get nearly the same amount of shaming as widows do for finding someone new.", "YTA on several levels here.  As a widow myself, I can tell you that you likely have no idea what it is like to lose a partner to death.  How your sister processes her grief and all the changes in her life is her business alone.  For sure many are in no way ready for another relationship for a while and most are incredibly lonely.  The loneliness is huge and I'm happy she has some company instead of suffering alone like some expect and like many widows do. Life threw her a curve ball and now it is up to her to survive that and move forward as best she can.  I hope all works out for her.  She doesn't need busybodies gossiping about her. Believe me when I tell you there is NO one way to grieve and you are not privy to what is written on her heart.", "YTA. You're right that it's in poor taste to post the dude on social media so soon. But she had already done it and is still with this guy 6 months later. What does shaming her now accomplish? It's better to just mind your own business.", "Grief is a nebulous, inexplicable thing sometimes. Sometimes it is quiet. Sometimes is loud. Sometimes it seeks attention and company, other it requires immense solitude. Sometimes it just needs to get laid. Sometimes it \\*\\*GASP\\*\\* needs a non-judgmental friend. It is always different for each person. Other people's grief responses are generally none of your god-damned business, even if your are family. Who or what is being harmed here exactly?\n\nIf the answer is your delicate sensibilities, decorum (whatever that actually means in practical terms), or your personal morality, then 100% YTA.\n\nHave the day you deserve. :) What you deserve is up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT. Typos.", "YTA. They were together for 10 and married for 2. But was your half-sister happy? You have no clue what that relationship was like behind closed doors. I\u2019m not saying she was glad that her husband passed, but maybe the relationship wasn\u2019t all that great.

At some point she will need to reflect on what type of job she wants to get to fund her lifestyle. And it might feel good now to have a new love, the high of a new relationship. But most people would be wary about getting into a relationship with someone newly widowed only 12 weeks before.  And the people who would be interested in this situation may turn out to be not great partners once the relationship settles in, or possibly using the situation to slowly normalise an abusive relationship. \n\nMost cases where widows more on very quickly in a healthy manner, their spouse was suffering from an illness for some time, the death was expected, maybe even welcomed, grieved before the passing. Or the person had some experience of life before their partner. Your half-sister has never experienced adult life single and this death was unexpected. I think it's fair to voice concern about the affects of delaying the grieving process, the importance of her making time to put energy into herself and express caution about the character of this guy. Especially if she has young kids. She's 29 so at the end of the day it's her life and her choice, but expressing warning shouldn't make someone an AH.", "NTA\n\nOn what side of reddit are we again. In what world is it socially acceptable to have a new bf 6 weeks after your husband DIED - with whom you supposedly were in a loving relationship", "NTA", "Exactly. The opposite view is that she was in a very happy marriage and her instinct is to try to recreate that as quickly as possible. It may not be the healthiest way to grieve but it's certainly not evidence of cheating . (it's equally possible, of course, that her husband was cheating, the relationship was over but that they hadn't shred that information with others and she saw no reason to do so after his death)", "Wow, that's a big leap to accuse the new guy of wanting to live off the woman's parents.", "For real. Right message, wrong messenger.", "It is not OP's sibling who died.  OP's sister lost her husband and has since met someone else. While it is true that the deceased's family may be hurt or upset by how quickly she seems to have moved on, OP doesn't say that  any of his family has said anything at all, either to sister or to OP, and OP also admits that she isn't close to her sister, and she went about this in the worst possible way, attaching her sister rather than gently mentioning that it might be kinder, and less likely to result in criticism, to be a little more discreet.", "This. NTA because if my BIL started dating six weeks after my sisters death I\u2019d be devastated and so would my parents. It is in bad taste and while I appreciate that she\u2019s young and would want to move on, six weeks isn\u2019t enough time to process things.", "Yeah, OP cares more about the \"friendlies\" thinking bad about her sister (and in a way thinking bad about HER personally) than she cares about her own sister's feelings.", "So what? She should stop her life to make her inlaws happy? YTA", "Their grief is not her responsibility.", "When you have kids and they are of age to marry, you do not gain a kid. Your kid is starting a family. We need to stop getting that twisted, YTA", "When my aunt died suddenly, her widow moved on fairly quickly. I admit, it kind of stung and we weren't exactly happy about it. But, ultimately, we understood that was his life. If he could find joy again, my aunt would have wanted that. So we got over ourselves, dealt with our grief in our way and didn't try to police his.", "I also lost my partner suddenly at 23. It\u2019s the most traumatic experience and leaves a hole in your heart than isn\u2019t simply erased by finding someone new. That person was an individual that they are ALL grieving. New partners aren\u2019t a replacement, they\u2019re people who will fit in your heart in a completely different way.\n\nOf course it\u2019s odd that your sister is seeing someone so quickly, and I understand it might be unhealthy and look bad. But that\u2019s for her to navigate in her own time. Grief is incredibly confusing and people cope, deal with and distract themselves in different ways."]}
