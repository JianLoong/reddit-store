It started one day in September as I was just walking around during PE and these group of girls (mainly 3 of them) - well, we\u2019ll call them Ashely, Monica, and Rachelle - came up to me and started talking to me. They started to compliment on the fact that I had dyed hair but it wasn't really compliments it was mainly all just a joke to get a quick laugh out of ppl. \n\nFlash forward, behavior like this continues to get worse such as: \u201cfake compliments\", getting in personal space, humiliating me infront of others, trying to make me go out on a date as a joke with their guy friends, harassing my other friend, following me and my other friend, taking pictures of me, and many other things. \n\nI told one of my closest friends about it and she said that it's been going on forever and that I should tell someone. I thought that snitching was a bitch move until one day my PE teacher caught them harrasing me again and asked about it. I was hesitant at first but said I would explain more after class and after class was over I explained what had been going on. \n\nThe next time i had PE they started giving me shit by saying \"they did absolutely nothing\" and that they were only \"joking\" and that they were going to \"apologize\" for it later. now I feel like what I did was a bitch move - but my friends say what I did was right. \n\nWhat do you think?

The bully is mad that she got caught for her bad behavior and now she's blaming you for it. If she hadn't behaved immaturely in the first place then there wouldn't be an issue. And the \"it was all just a joke\" is a common excuse bullies use so they don't have to accept the consequences of their behavior. If they continue to bully you then you should continue to report them. Also let your parents know about this. \n\nNTA", "Bullies rely on your silence to be an easy victim.  Well... Fuck them!  They deserve all the shit to come down on them like a ton of fucking pig shit.\n\nNTA, good for you for FINALLY standing up for yourself.", "NTA - Most bullies use this \"it was only a joke\" excuse, and it's a poor excuse for acting like an AH. Besides, you didn't report them. You were asked, and you opened up and told your teacher the truth.\n\nYou're never a snitch when it comes to bullies and protecting yourself from them.", "NTA!\n  \nSorry you are being bullied, it is the worst \u2014 hope things get better soon~", "NTA\n\nYour teacher caught them and asked you about it. You did not go to your teacher about it. You did not snitch on them.\n\nSorry that you're being bullied. That sucks.", "You are NTA! I\u2019m proud of you for speaking up for yourself. You should never feel like an asshole for making your mental health and well-being a priority. The thing about mean girls is that they\u2019re always going to find something rude to say about you. If you didn\u2019t speak up to your PE teacher, they\u2019d keep harassing you. TBH now that you told your teacher, they probably still will. It sucks, but I promise as long as you don\u2019t let the rude things they say or \u201cjokes\u201d they play get to you, you will be okay! Just remember that many people love + value you, and that these bullies are scums for making others feel bad in order to feel better about themselves. Keep your head up OP!", "NTA.  If someone is bullying you, you do whatever you need to within reason (not violence or like ruining someone\u2019s life of course) to make it stop.

Ignore them as best as you can and do not interact as they will only try to make you feel worse", "NTA", "NTA.   \nThey got found out, and are on a watch list now, and have been told to knock it off.

You\u2019re sticking up for yourself and you should be proud of that.", "Bitch about them everyday. Like EVERYDAY! Keep going. Every second you have until the teachers get sick of it. That will put a stop to it. That's what I did. That was 1988.", "NTA. Never feel bad or guilty about standing up for yourself! High school is a tough time to go through and the fact that some silly girls decided to pick on someone else and got caught serves them right! They\u2019re only telling you they would have said sorry, because they were caught. If they were actually sorry about what they did they would have apologized to you straight away.

I was bullied all through school, so don\u2019t hesitate to report any bullying to teachers or staff.", "Dear young OP, you are NTA and you did not snitch on them. Actions have consequences for those mean girls who bullied you. Bravo to the PE teacher who saw what they did and did something. \n\nYou did not do a bitch move at all. You done the right thing and you are not at fault. Those mean bullies are angry because they got caught red handed being meanies towards you so they played a stupid game and they won a stupid prize. You in the end won a clever prize and have a supportive friend and a kind PE teacher by your side as allies\n\nI am truly sorry that you were bullied yet I am glad you are getting help thanks to the PE teacher who did something. Moving forward, I suggest you ignore those three meanies. They are just three pathetic losers who deserve no attention. You have the right to not forgive them (remember choosing not to forgive them does not make you a bad person), refuse their apology and not accept their \"only joking\" excuse. Secondly, do not be afraid to continue speaking up and document every single bad behaviour they done to you. If they move on to threatening you or stalking you, you know what to do: report them for harassment to the school staff and the authorities. Those bullies need to learn that bullying people is not nice\n\nDo not feel guilty for speaking up and getting help. This is never your fault. You did the right thing to make it clear to them they need to stop with their bad behaviour otherwise they would have repeated to others or worse carry on with their bad behaviour when they enter university and the workforce. It is true that as long as kids who bully do not get their bad behaviour sorted, they will grow up to become adults who bully"]}
