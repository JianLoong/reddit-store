I didn't pay for the few days I'm here before I move but then again I think l feel it's fine since I frontend everything on the 20th and more at the beginning of last month", "The manager knows I'm here and offered me an upcoming place but I'd rather just leave. Communication goes a long way when you're honest with them", "I got a place and move out on Saturday. I didn't tell them why I was leaving, just that I was. Oddly enough the manager is upset I'm leaving, because I'm the only responsible one even though I'm not on the lease", "I have so much anxiety about living situations and it being before Xmas at the time didn't want any more stress. It took them a week to reply to me when I said I was moving so realistically they've only known for a week. Still, is ridiculous that adults act this way", "True but I'm told I'm to kind for giving them a heads up and fronting the rent.", "Because I'm stupid I suppose? I also did want a roof over my head until I got a new place which I managed to do lol", "Tbh I'm not really friends with them, just lived here. I don't even know what they wasted it on.
