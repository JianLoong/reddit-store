(How would she even make the eight hour journey comfortably?)\n\nWith that said, however, care taking can be extremely exhausting both mentally and physically. If your mom doesn't have much support, (by her own frustrating choice, I know), it would be good to find an alternative solution for Grandma so she can catch a break. Times like these call for a revisit to the living so far apart situation. If your mom wants familial support she has to make some compromises, too.", "NTA. First of all, you're not required to let *anyone else* live in your residence.\n\nSecondly, it would be bad for grandma for the reasons you explained.\n\nThird, you mother is getting paid to take care of grandma, and she wants you do do it for free.\n\nYou're not in any way being unreasonable, and especially should not feel guilty for not taking on a task that would result in grandma getting inadequate care and housing.", "NTA. There are nursing homes that offer short term care. This is where your grandmother should go.", "NTA. You're looking out for your grandmother's safety considering your schedule and inability to provide adequate and safe shelter during the time that your mother is asking you to watch her for. Moving your grandmother away from her care team is irresponsible, and even if your mom and grandmother aren't meaning to, they're setting you up for massive blame and guilt if something were to happen during that time -- even though it's admittedly a short time. Yes, your grandmother is family and yes, it's natural to feel a little guilty about your decision, but moving your grandmother to your house for ANY length of time is something that should require tedious planning, the approval of her care team and YOUR APPROVAL TOO!!", "NTA. If your grandmother\u2019s health is as precarious as all that, you are not qualified to be her caretaker (unless I am mistaken and you are a medical professional). Your mother could contact an agency that offers respite care and arrange for someone to cover for the days she will be gone.", "You are NTA, you have listed how this really wouldn\u2019t work out since you have no place for her to sleep and you will be at work.

If you're not equipped for her medical needs, it's not an appropriate arrangement", "NTA. This is going to sound horrible, but your mom just needs to chill on worrying about long cruises and cherish time left with her mother, because it doesn't sounds like she has too long.  Also what is she thinking What and how would she feel and how terrible would it be if Grandma passed away while her daughter your mother was way on a cruise a freaking cruise for goodness sakes!\nThat's something that would be traumatizing for you and your mother unless your mother is a nightmare but I don't know your full story I'm just saying.", "NTA, I am the full-time caregiver to my 90 plus mother. In the past three plus years I have not had more than 3 hours off.  That was for a root canal.  I can sympathize with your mom, but for grandma to be in such bad shape and to take a cruise, a trip that she cannot come home from easily if something happens is selfish.  If she must go, there is what is call respite care where she can book grandma into a nursing home for a short stay.

The fact that she made the choice along with your mother to not make the necessary arrangements to include you in her care team is, in and of itself, a move with the clear purpose of removing some of your responsibility despite your willingness to help.

Your grandmother will be in a facility for that time as it doesn't sound like she can be at home on her own and just have nurses come to her.  She needs a higher level of care like at at facility.\n\nYou are thinking of your grandmothers safety... but more importantly, your husband and kids come first no matter how much your mother and grandmother don't like that."]}
