I very much wish it wasn't real myself, to be fair, so I understand the skepticism. I think another part of the issue is that the wedding is going to involve a bit of travel for some people (seven hours drive at the longest, but plenty that are 5-6 hours away), and dog hotels and such can be expensive?", ">But she does call her cocker spaniel one of her kids, and has for 6-7 years so I guess I can see how she felt that it was perhaps unfair?\n\nI can't.  Dogs are generally pretty fricking awesome... but they're not kids.  Anyone who gets a wedding invite where kids are allowed and thinks \"Oh yay, my dog can attend\" is taking the piss.  That's not reasonable behaviour.\n\nI'd never harsh someone for just asking a question... chancing their arm... but their reaction to the \"no\" says nothing bad but things about them.", "Get real.   Kids and dogs aren't comparable.   That's just stupid\nIf the dog lovers refuse to come without their pets, so be it.   \n\nNTA", "I call my dogs my kids but I don\u2019t want to bring them to functions.", "\u201cyou will be missed!\u201d is what you say to these people. Do not let them bully/blackmail you into allowing dogs by threatening to not attend.", "It\u2019s not like you can take your dog into a fancy restaurant. And a wedding is a similar setting. Food service rules may not even allow them there but it\u2019s certainly not the first time that they\u2019ve encountered this. Personally I would uninvite the friend that stirred up this drama. They are the clear AH here", "I have 2 children: a human daughter and a feline son. This summer, we attended 2 weddings where kids were allowed. Guess what? We only brought the human daughter.", "I\u2019d be presently surprised if I could bring my goofy floofy allergy machines to a wedding, but one of the key words there is \u2018surprised\u2019. If it\u2019s not an assistance animal, it\u2019s neither expected nor needed at a strange location with strange people and strange behaviours.", "Nah, that's still ridiculous. Look, I am a person who considers my dog (and my cat) my \"kids\". They're both awesome, but that's not the same thing as them being on the level of actual human children. I can't imagine being invited to a wedding that allows kids and thinking \"yesssssss time to bring my dog\", that's just weird. I honestly don't understand people who want to take their dogs everywhere, it's a pain in the ass 99% of the time. Mine gets to go to Petsmart sometimes, to a specific breakfast place that has a dog-friendly outdoor patio and on our yearly roadtrip to visit my partner's family because my MIL explicitly invites the dog and begs us to bring her. \n\nUnless it's like... the most casual outdoor wedding and the hosts make it clear they WANT guests to bring their dogs, dogs do not belong at weddings.", "NTA. I call my dogs and cats my kids, but I leave their furry butts at home where they belong.", "I love this, that\u2019s exactly what they are! \ud83d\ude02", "\"Guestzilla\" !!.....my new favourite word! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "No. Do not tell them the venue said no dogs. You said no dogs.", "Maybe, but it's still waaaaay out there, and giving you a hard time about it such that you feel the need to do an r/AITA post is uncouth AF.", "Then wouldn't they also need to have their input... perhaps they already have animals or don't want to mess with pet excrement.", "My dog loves people and kids too but if she saw your dog, she'd go ape shit. Lol", "(slaps forehead) my bad.\n\nYour wedding is literally all about you two. You say what goes and doesn't. \n\nAlso some people complain louder than they understand, doesn't mean they don't get it.\n\nEnjoy your day and remember to breath. \ud83d\ude01", "I'm truly sorry for your distress. NTA for not inviting dogs. I have no idea where these people are from but they seen a bit divorced from reality with this bullshit.\n\nWeddings should be a happy occasion. I suggest you think about eloping. It will probably cause its own kerfuffle, but at least for that day you need not worry about making others happy. Some of my family was a bit upset, but after an explanation and some time for them to cool down, they got over it.", "You\u2019re really not (the ah).Maybe if you want to make it up to them (and there\u2019s no reason you should)- you can have a separate \u201cdog friendly reception\u201d at a later date at the same place.", "I don\u2019t think that counts unless it\u2019s publicly known for being a dog sanctuary. And can you imagine the distraction of having a bunch of dogs running around barking and doing dog stuff during the ceremony? The only way I can see it being acceptable is if these are genuine support dogs that they need to take every single place and even then I think it\u2019s pushing it. NTA.", "The fact that it\u2019s even a huge issue is nuts. Guess OP needs to clarify that only **HUMAN** children are included", "We didn't even bring our \"furry son\" to our own wedding. Kids would have been allowed if our guests had had any.", "All good! And thank you!", "Thank you, genuinely. Neither my nor my partners families are really the \"wedding\" types so there wouldn't really be much of an issue there. But we are both pretty strongly against doing the elopement option because like... we were excited, and still mostly are! But this is kinda harshing my vibe :/"]}
