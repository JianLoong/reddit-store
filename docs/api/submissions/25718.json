I saw my brother (35) after a few months and he looked me up and down and said \u201cYou lost your ass, used to be bigger\u201d and also said \u201cWhat happened to your jugs?\u201d then laughed. I looked at my mom and she didn\u2019t say anything. I just sat down. My family is full of outspoken and weird people, it\u2019s basically a norm. Nobody reacts to these sorts of comments. I think it\u2019s weird for anybody, especially family of the opposite sex to comment such a thing. After we left i told my mom that (my brother) is a perv.. she said \u201cNo he isn\u2019t\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t say that\u201d so i just kept quiet. AITAH for calling him a perv? Is this normal in other families?\n \nUPDATE: As of 30 seconds ago i texted my brother and told him \n \n\u201cRemember when you made those comments about my body last time i saw you? Do you wanna maybe not do that next time? A \u201cgood job\u201d or nothing at all would be lovely. THANKS.\u201d \n \nI\u2019m currently shaking. Hopefully he doesn\u2019t call my mom mansplaining and i get chewed out by her for standing up for myself. For once. In the past, if i ever talked back to him, he\u2019d beat me pretty bad, but now that I\u2019m an adult, if he so much as threatens me i have no issue filing a report.\n \nUPDATE 2: He texted me back and said\n \n\u201cI\u2019m coming over after work and we can figure this out. Bring mom.\u201d \ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f\n \nUm what??? Now he\u2019s trying to involve OUR MOM in hopes she\u2019ll take HIS defense and then probably call me out for feeling uncomfortable by HIS comment. This is what i wanted to avoid. I don\u2019t want this man coming to my place?? But he will anyways. I knew this was going to happen. He literally cannot defend his comment because in no way, shape, or form is that \u201cnormal\u201d or ok to blurt out to somebody. I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s trying to do by seeing me. \n\nI texted him back and said:\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to figure out i just don\u2019t want you to make comments about my body. A simple \u201cgood job\u201d or nothing is good enough and that goes for anybody. Thanks.\u201d \n \n\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\n\nUPDATE 3: He called my mom. Like i knew he would. He said if i didn\u2019t want to hear comments about my body, i should\u2019ve worn different clothes. I was wearing Hollister jeans and a T shirt. He also said \u201cIt\u2019s not weird at all you\u2019re just a stuck up brat.\u201d I told my mom not to let him come to my place because if he touches me again, I\u2019m calling the cops. I told my mom how his comments made me uncomfortable, she said \u201cAlright. I agree.\u201d but this started a huge fight with my brother.

Also, who says \u201cjugs\u201d anymore?!? \nMy brother teased me about being smaller-chested when we were both going thru puberty, but he\u2019s about your brother\u2019s age now and I\u2019m sure would sooner die than comment on my body parts.", "NTA\n\nthat's extremely disturbing to say especially to you're sibling.", "NTA.

Stick with yourself.", "ESH \n\nI don't think you're good at confrontation tbh. That passive aggressive text you sent will get pushback or ignored every time. People don't take you seriously when you speak like that. \n\nYour brother doesn't sound like he has a filter though. It's an awkward dynamic if not everyone is on board with unfiltered conversations. Probably wouldn't speak to my sister like that but I've seen other families be pretty blunt with each other. \n\nThink you went a little far calling him a perv though.", "This feels like bait. You sound unsure in the post and then immediately pile on your family in the comments when they agree with your obvious superiority", "NTA but overly sensitive and if you blow this out of proportion you'll be TAH.", "Ok, here is a question.  Lets say you had a sister, and she made a similar comment.  Would you find that \"pervy\" or just an observation?  Because I'm guessing a lot of your issue comes from the fact that he is related to you, but you'd be ok with a woman related to you saying a similar thing.  He likely doesn't see you in a sexual way.  But he notices things.  Just like if a guy noticed his little brother worked out a lot and got jacked, he may say something.  Or if he got fat, he may say he is developing man boobs.  Siblings comment shit like that.\n\nNow to be clear, I don't necessarily think he should have said it.  But I think you are making this into some sexual thing that isn't really there.  \n\nAlso, if he calls your mom and tells her what happened, how is that mansplaining?  \n\nIt sounds like your issue with your brother are far deeper than one comment.  \n\nESH.  You for calling him a perv, him for making those comments in the first place.", "ESH this isn't normal, but if that's the norm then why haven't you gotten used to it lol\n\nhe thinks it's normal, so telling your mom will only anger him because again, he thinks it's normal", "YTA.  He wasn't sexualizing you, he was roasting his little sister about her body changes.  Get over yourself", "I would totally comment on my sisters or brothers body like this, i admitt, and they would about mine. Thats just the way we speak to each others, no filters, nothing. We are siblings, we know each other for as long we are alive, we grew up together, we have seen our worst and our most awkwards moments / times. Since there is nothing sexual about our relationship, none of us would think the other is a perv for commenting each others body. \n\nSo what i'm wondering is, is sexualising your relationship with your sibling (so seing him as a sexual active guy and not just as your sibling) something new, you came up with or was your relationship always like this as long you can remember? \n\nBc its not normal to make a sexual connection in your brain when it comes to your siblings or parents.

That\u2019s why he\u2019s also saying he\u2019s going to come to my home today and told me to bring our mom.. he always needs her there to defend him despite being a grown 35 year old man who can stand up for himself. He should just accept my boundaries and move on.\n \nESH??? If calling him a perv was wrong of me, what term would you have rather me used? Outspoken? Unnecessary? lol I\u2019m so confused here", "Um i didn\u2019t ask for his opinion on my body changes for one.. and secondly, why do you think it\u2019s ok for a big brother to talk about his little sister\u2019s butt and breasts? \u201cget over myself\u201d lol ok but everybody in the comments are agreeing with him BTAH.. should we all get over ourself for pointing it out?", "Yeah you don't \"roast\" your little sister specifically about her ass and boobs, that's weirdly fucking sexual for a brother sister relationship.\n\nAlso besides that fact: if it makes her uncomfortable he was out of line and needs to apologize. Doesn't matter the nature of the comment but shitty Humor like that and that sexist \"boys will be boys\" attitude has been accepted for way to long", "He was sexualising her and it\u2019s gross.", "Creep get out pls", "If my brother said anything similar to me, I'd have told him to fuck off. But he wouldn't do that because he isn't a perv.", "Just because you and your siblings make comments about each other\u2019s bodies doesn\u2019t mean me and mine do too because we DO NOT.\n \nYou\u2019re asking me how long I\u2019ve viewed him as a \u201csexual active guy\u201d instead of my \u201csibling\u201d? Because I\u2019m uncomfortable he pointed out my butt and breast size? I didn\u2019t ask for him to make those comments but somehow I\u2019m wrong for feeling uncomfortable by it? Hence you actually suggesting i view him as something other than my brother..? That\u2019s sick.", "He focused on those area rather than her overall appearance, yeah that\u2019s fucking weird?? Also their entire family is fucked up bc did y\u2019all gloss over the part where she said he beat her? And her mother defends this? And he can\u2019t take a very reasonably response on board, just goes right to intimidation? \nThe dude is fucked up and OP has every right to feel that\u2019s inappropriate. \nNow maybe you feel comfortable commenting on your parents/sibling breast/penis/ass size on the reg, but many of us find that a fucked up thing to be commenting about to anyone, OP isn\u2019t weird for that sentiment", "that\u2019s chilling to even think about.. i have no clue anymore.", "thank you i agree", "The way your mother reacted makes me think there's more information there. Like she \\*knows\\* he's a perv and is in serious denial.\n\nIf could also just be garden variety golden child syndrome.", "That is really painful, and I'm sorry. This internet stranger is proud of you for your accomplishments!", "*spits water out* (And I wasn't even drinking something) You're telling us a nearly 40 year old man requested his mommy be present for such a tiny interaction...there's definitely more going on here. Perhaps you should distance yourself from these people. Men who are 40 going on 16 tend to be vortices of trouble. All their self inflicted problems become everyone's who stay in their vicinity.", "So your mom is an enabler. I'm sorry OP, it's weird,  creepy and wrong.  Good on you for standing up for yourself.  \ud83d\udc4d", "Does he sexualize her body too? I get the feeling that would upset her but maybe it would wake her up.", "It sounds like there are some bizarre family dynamics at play that were established long before you were born.", "This is the norm with a lot of mothers unfortunately! Love their sons and hate their daughters smh NTA. Block him ans. Keep it pushing", "I agree with you and your brother has no right to make comments like this. Unsolicited comments are usually rude. But 35 isn't almost 40, just say mid thirties please.", "I'm a guy in his 40s.\n\nI can understand that some family relations can be weird and awkward.  I feel if there was a closer age difference and more importantly a history of such comments ( coming both ways) that could be considered skeevy but on a line that can be moved due to comfort etc of either party.\n\n\n\nThere's a 15 year age difference. \nThat's just wrong.\n\nAs a man with a little sister with such a huge age difference, he's supposed to show you how men that age are supposed to respect young women such as yourself.\n\n\nThe fact he didn't apologize right away after.your text. And went crying to mother, shows he's a weak man.\n\nFuck it. You do you.\nDude forgets, or more likely doesn't have a clue about young woman, their body issues etc.\n\nMake sure you warn his partner ( or potential). But I also assume that he's probably single.", "My response to anyone calling me out in front of people about my body is to do the very same to them. \"Brother dear, have you gone up a cup size? And it looks like its time for some new shirts that don't make your gut look like a beach ball, huh?\"\n\nNot helpful. Not even civil. But, it redirects the dialogue and shuts them down.", "Sounds Perfect!", "I'm so sorry you have to deal with that kind of bullshit. It sounds like your mother has picked out a \"golden child\" and has failed to teach him the concept of words and actions having consequences.", "I would consider the fact he is most probably abusing his wife and that's why she hadn't spoken up. He happily verbally and physically abuses you with no consequences so he has learnt he can do that", "My brother's the same in a way. Not pervy, but he makes sexist jokes and if I try to tell him that it's not appropriate or even just give him a dissatisfied look, he'll blow up. It's because no one, mom, dad etc, have ever confronted him about his attitude. In fact, they kind of encourage it like your mom did. Sorry your bro is like that, it sucks.", "It's always wise to set your own boundaries, and letting people know is the easiest way to begin that process.  If he starts a huge fight, you're under no obligation to take part. You're allowed to feel however you feel, and you're allowed to express that.", "Totally! I wish you so much luck!", "Good for you! It also didn\u2019t register to me before how much younger you are than he is. My brother and I are like 2 years apart. He definitely needs to knock it off.", "That's crazy", "Ugh, he has a wife?", "No prob.  I think your brother needs to learn  where a over the top joke or remark is appropriate and where it isn't...you'd really hope he would have enough of an idea at 35 to be able to say \"I'm sorry, that sounded different in my head\", but clearly not.  It kind of makes you wonder what his interactions with other women are like.", "What he said was out of order to anyone let alone weird to say to a family member. And clearly a mommas boy that need to grow up", "I agree he is making this bigger than it should be by involving your mother.", "I'd call him rude, not a perv.  \n\nCalling something that has an implication of sexualization.", "If your sister, or an older cousin commented, would you have the same issue?", "I didn't say it was ok for him to roast you about your body changes, and yes, you DIDN'T ask for his opinion.  However, you called him a perv, and he clearly wasn't trying to ogle his sister, he was just being a sarcastic jackass.  Therefore, get over yourself calling him a perv or a creep. Those are comments that can DESTROY a guy's life, so why throw that term out so casually?", "Either way, we're all here in full support of you, and your definitely not the asshole in this situation, you definitely should reconsider your options and what's good for your children though much support and love to you \u2764\u2764\u2764", "I have no clue. I don\u2019t ask her about that stuff to avoid being screamed at..", "He\u2019s 35 and still acting like this, still bringing his mom in to fix all his problems, and is being treated like a child when in reality it\u2019s OP who\u2019s significantly younger & is the one who should be being protected here, not the creep. He\u2019s confident in his behaviour and confident that nobody will call him out. That screams that this is NOT new from him in the slightest", "You\u2019re so kind. Thank you so much. \ud83e\ude77", "Ugh, yeah, I thought that was incredi-strange myself. A 35 year old adult running to his mommy because of light criticism from his sister? Hmm\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s normal sibling rivalry, and then there\u2019s this\u2026", "I would consider the fact he is most probably abusing his wife and that's why she hadn't spoken up. He happily verbally and physically abuses you with no consequences so he has learnt he can do that", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT MADE ME LAUGH and it\u2019s so funny you mention that, he isn\u2019t a fit at all!!!! He\u2019s probably triple my weight.. but i never made a comment to him.. just shows how ignorant he really is.", "\"I'd comment on your beer gut and man boobs but  I'm not in the habit of assessing my physical attraction to my sibling.\"", "Thank you. I agree. She can keep him as a \u201cfavorite\u201d or whatever else, I\u2019ve known this and accepted it but he needs to learn to watch his mouth.. because what he said is NOT OK!!!", "I hope it gets better for both of us.", "Thank you so much!!!", "TYSM\ud83e\ude77", "If it walks, quacks and shits like a duck  it isn't a cinnamon roll. Stop bulwarking perverted chimo-ish behavior, especially for a known abuser, it just makes you look like an enabler, trust me I know. Defending the indefensible just puts you smack dab in the middle of perv-enabler-town. Stop while you are ahead, blaming the victim for clearly out of bounds conduct only makes you part of the problem...", "This is sensible. It sucks that you can\u2019t get the support and closure that you deserve, but since you know she isn\u2019t capable of being the parent you need, it is good, sensible self-defence to not invest your energy in trying to make her be better.\n\nThe same goes for your brother. You don\u2019t have to indulge his fucked up behaviour. You have told him nicely how to behave. From now on, you don\u2019t have to place nice. Meet any further remarks with \u201cwow, are you creeping on your own sister in public again? Get help, sicko\u201d. Then walk away from him. Don\u2019t see him if you can avoid it. Block his number. He\u2019s trying to overwhelm your defences, so just hold the line. You don\u2019t have to get creative, just get consistent. \u201cCreepy remarks again! Get therapy!\u201d until he gets bored of tantrumming.\n\nYou cannot fix gross, pathetic people. You can limit their access to be gross at you.", "As someone who pretty much gave up on voicing things due to either being yelled at or bulldozed over I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with it. Really makes it hard but now I just have a high tolerance for getting yelled at. I would recommend trying to limit your exposure to your family and also think about therapy or something to help you become more assertive and although don\u2019t go the way of your family learn your stern say it with your chest voice and use it in life because being afraid to talk really does destroy your ability to get your way in life. I know it can be difficult and I\u2019m still quiet when I talk at times afraid to butt in and I have to consciously remind myself my voice and opinions are valid and I am worthy of being heard even if the other side doesn\u2019t want to hear it. Best of luck and you really should try and cut back time with your family if they are that toxic.", "First of all good for you for standing up for yourself. I had a family member who would do the same- I would mention- \"Goodness, aren't you looking prosperous! \" every time. A little P/A goes a long way...", "NTA - Please do this and update us on his reaction. I'd like to also suggest you think about a couple of responses ahead of time so you're ready, \n\n\"It's nice to see that the weight I lost stayed in the family, it looks like you gave it a home around your waist.\" \n\n\"Brother, can you still see your feet? Can you still bend over and tie your shoes?\" \n\nAnd ths one I'd love to watch his face when you say this \"how much worse is your ED with all of that weight you've added?\" \" can you even find it under that stomach?\"", "Lol and he\u2019s fat af hahaha? He even got a woman or kids", "Kinda makes me wonder what his childhood was like, and what kind of guilt she might be carrying over it.", "That is the best saying I've ever seen \ud83d\ude02", "It's whatever man"]}
