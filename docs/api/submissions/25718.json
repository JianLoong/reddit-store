I saw my brother (35) after a few months and he looked me up and down and said \u201cYou lost your ass, used to be bigger\u201d and also said \u201cWhat happened to your jugs?\u201d then laughed. I looked at my mom and she didn\u2019t say anything. I just sat down. My family is full of outspoken and weird people, it\u2019s basically a norm. Nobody reacts to these sorts of comments. I think it\u2019s weird for anybody, especially family of the opposite sex to comment such a thing. After we left i told my mom that (my brother) is a perv.. she said \u201cNo he isn\u2019t\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t say that\u201d so i just kept quiet. AITAH for calling him a perv? Is this normal in other families?\n \nUPDATE: As of 30 seconds ago i texted my brother and told him \n \n\u201cRemember when you made those comments about my body last time i saw you? Do you wanna maybe not do that next time? A \u201cgood job\u201d or nothing at all would be lovely. THANKS.\u201d \n \nI\u2019m currently shaking. Hopefully he doesn\u2019t call my mom twisting what i said, and i get chewed out by her for standing up for myself. For once. In the past, if i ever talked back to him, he\u2019d beat me pretty bad, but now that I\u2019m an adult, if he so much as threatens me i have no issue filing a report.\n \nUPDATE 2: He texted me back and said\n \n\u201cI\u2019m coming over after work and we can figure this out. Bring mom.\u201d \ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f\n \nUm what??? Now he\u2019s trying to involve OUR MOM in hopes she\u2019ll take HIS defense and then probably call me out for feeling uncomfortable by HIS comment. This is what i wanted to avoid. I don\u2019t want this man coming to my place?? But he will anyways. I knew this was going to happen. He literally cannot defend his comment because in no way, shape, or form is that \u201cnormal\u201d or ok to blurt out to somebody. I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s trying to do by seeing me. \n\nI texted him back and said:\n \n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to figure out i just don\u2019t want you to make comments about my body. A simple \u201cgood job\u201d or nothing is good enough and that goes for anybody. Thanks.\u201d \n \n\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude41\n\nUPDATE 3: He called my mom. Like i knew he would. He said if i didn\u2019t want to hear comments about my body, i should\u2019ve worn different clothes. I was wearing Hollister jeans and a T shirt. He also said \u201cIt\u2019s not weird at all you\u2019re just a stuck up brat.\u201d I told my mom not to let him come to my place because if he touches me again, I\u2019m calling the cops. I told my mom how his comments made me uncomfortable, she said \u201cAlright. I agree.\u201d but this started a huge fight with my brother. He\u2019s really angry.\n \nUPDATE 4: I didn\u2019t expect to get so many comments, I\u2019m trying to respond to them all. You guys are so kind in helping me navigate this situation THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. I really don\u2019t have many options of help when it comes to my family, so this means a lot. \n \nMy mom told me that my brother called her again, she told him to \u201cknock it off\u201d. He\u2019s getting mad at her for \u201cnot understanding\u201d. He wants her to defend him but i don\u2019t think she is. I don\u2019t know why he included her in this\u2026 He is a grown man pushing 40 and shouldn\u2019t need our mom\u2019s help in order to say his fault and just accept my boundaries\u2026? i don\u2019t understand it. He\u2019s only mad because i said something.. i spent my whole childhood being abused my him, not anymore. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna come over but i\u2019ll update in case.

Also, who says \u201cjugs\u201d anymore?!? \nMy brother teased me about being smaller-chested when we were both going thru puberty, but he\u2019s about your brother\u2019s age now and I\u2019m sure would sooner die than comment on my body parts.", "NTA\n\nthat's extremely disturbing to say especially to you're sibling.", "NTA.

People don't take you seriously when you speak like that. \n\nYour brother doesn't sound like he has a filter though. It's an awkward dynamic if not everyone is on board with unfiltered conversations. Probably wouldn't speak to my sister like that but I've seen other families be pretty blunt with each other. \n\nThink you went a little far calling him a perv though.", "This feels like bait. You sound unsure in the post and then immediately pile on your family in the comments when they agree with your obvious superiority", "NTA but overly sensitive and if you blow this out of proportion you'll be TAH.", "Ok, here is a question.  Lets say you had a sister, and she made a similar comment.  Would you find that \"pervy\" or just an observation?  Because I'm guessing a lot of your issue comes from the fact that he is related to you, but you'd be ok with a woman related to you saying a similar thing.  He likely doesn't see you in a sexual way.  But he notices things.  Just like if a guy noticed his little brother worked out a lot and got jacked, he may say something.  Or if he got fat, he may say he is developing man boobs.  Siblings comment shit like that.\n\nNow to be clear, I don't necessarily think he should have said it.  But I think you are making this into some sexual thing that isn't really there.  \n\nAlso, if he calls your mom and tells her what happened, how is that mansplaining?  \n\nIt sounds like your issue with your brother are far deeper than one comment.  \n\nESH.  You for calling him a perv, him for making those comments in the first place.", "ESH this isn't normal, but if that's the norm then why haven't you gotten used to it lol\n\nhe thinks it's normal, so telling your mom will only anger him because again, he thinks it's normal", "YTA.  He wasn't sexualizing you, he was roasting his little sister about her body changes.  Get over yourself", "I would totally comment on my sisters or brothers body like this, i admitt, and they would about mine. Thats just the way we speak to each others, no filters, nothing. We are siblings, we know each other for as long we are alive, we grew up together, we have seen our worst and our most awkwards moments / times. Since there is nothing sexual about our relationship, none of us would think the other is a perv for commenting each others body. \n\nSo what i'm wondering is, is sexualising your relationship with your sibling (so seing him as a sexual active guy and not just as your sibling) something new, you came up with or was your relationship always like this as long you can remember? \n\nBc its not normal to make a sexual connection in your brain when it comes to your siblings or parents.

Still not openly about everything because I would be the one cut out and I managed to arrange things so as to be tolerable but it's exhausting. So good for you to have the courage to set boundaries and the more you do it, the less sh*t people give you because you radiate \"cannot f*ck with me\" vibes.

I try, i really do but i can\u2019t. I was a child. I was helpless. Also, he is married. They\u2019ve been together since i was a child. Long story short, They aren\u2019t happy. He doesn\u2019t let her eat certain foods, it\u2019s so sad. I don\u2019t know why. We have get together\u2019s and the poor woman eats like she hasn\u2019t in a very long time.

The parents screw up on the older kids, and *maybe* do a little better on round 2 - but then spend the rest of their lives terrified to set a single boundary with the older kids out of overwhelming guilt and shame. The older kids resent the younger kids for having better childhoods, the younger kids resent the older kids for taking their anger out on them, the parents throw up their hands and act helpless to stop it for fear of completely alienating their older kids, trusting that the younger kids will be fine no matter what because their childhoods weren\u2019t as shitty.", "This lines up perfectly\u2026 you literally just described my family in this one paragraph\u2026 woah\u2026. \ud83d\ude33"]}
