The baby is always going to be a part of you whatever name they got. To him thought, this is his first parenting decision, to shut him down like that when you don't really have a relationship to begin with is going to be extremely alienating.

Even if you clash (and you will eventually, but nothing you can't handle if you compromise) if will still be time to get it right and talk it over again. Maybe hybernate your surnames, his first name, your surname or vice versa - just because a name has sentimental value to him doesn't mean you have to agree to it, everything is the art of compromise and this affects both of you for at least the next 18 years, it is worth starting to practice this before giving birth.", "Here's my take for what it's worth. It sounds like he freaked\u00a0out in the beginning but was at least going to your appointments with you. You mentioned that neither of you wants to be in a relationship, so outside of your pregnancy related appointments, it would make sense\u00a0that he was keeping his distance. (Your comment about him all of a sudden being a better\u00a0person I think is out of line. If you had said you were in a relationship and\u00a0then he became distant, fair play for the comment. Slight ta for that.)\n\nHowever, it seems that with time he has been contemplating\u00a0his role and what he\u00a0wants moving forward, which is why he's become more present as you mentioned. I highly recommend an open and honest conversation regarding each other's expectations from your relationship and co-parenting moving forward. That will inform your next steps. If in fact, there is to be no relationship outside of co-parenting and you are going to be the primary caregiver, then absolutely give them your last name. If the\u00a0relationship is going to be anything else, perhaps consider a compromise of hyphenating\u00a0both of your surnames.\u00a0\n\nRegardless, NTA for any decision\u00a0you make as long as you have the open and honest conversation with him prior as previously\u00a0mentioned. Again just my 2 cents\u00a0to be taken with a grain of salt.", "NAH. The answer to this question depends on the level of involvement your child\u2019s father wants to have. If he wants 50/50 custody, a hyphenated last name is the appropriate solution because you would be equal parents. If he only wants visitation every other weekend, the child should have your last name to make it easier for you to handle the administrative aspects of parenting. Before having the discussion about the last name, come up with a parenting plan first. The parenting plan should be the guide for the last name discussion, not the other way around.", "Nta but understand this will be a fight no matter what. However considering the fact you are not married,  have no intention of pursuing a relationship and he has not been very supportive in the beginning or throughout the pregnancy. You can try to compromise and make a point to him you only get to choose one first or last name not both.
