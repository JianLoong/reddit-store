For one thing - your mom said she will just smoke while on the 2 hr drive.  JFC people.  Driving while stoned is driving impaired.  A recent study out of Canada (where it's been legal since 2018) showed: Documented marijuana-related traffic accidents that required treatment in an emergency room rose 475% between 2010 and 2021, the study found.

But when we go to my daughter and her SO's for Thanksgiving (they don't indulge) I don't bring any. Because it would be rude. Yes it's legal where she lives. That's not relevant. What's relevant is that I assume (I've never asked her) that she and her SO might not be comfortable with consuming it in their home. So I don't. The point of Thanksgiving is to spend time with people I love NOT to get high.  Your family has a serious problem with their priorities.", "NTA. \"It's only a day.\" Great, so they can suck it up and skip it for only a day.

Good job on not indulging this bulshit.", "NTA Weed smell lingers.

I've been a daily toker for close to 20 years and I can make the hour drive to my mom's place, dinner and the drive home without anything in my system. Does food taste better when stoned? Oh hell yes it does. Is that reason to disregard your house rules or skip the dinner? Absolutely not. It really ruffles my jimmies when people put pot before people.
