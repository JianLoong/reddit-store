I feel like he is already throwing away a life long military career for a girl that is beneath him. \n\nI figure if we don\u2019t give her the address he will assume she lost interest and probably already shacking up with another man (which less face it she most likely is) and he can focus on his future instead of this girl who will only screw it up. \n\nSome family has told me I\u2019m being an ass but I\u2019m just looking out for my son and his future.

I cannot believe someone can write this entire post and not conclude at the obvious: YTA\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\nYour son clearly doesn\u2019t seem interested in the military career, so you\u2019re being an AH to him by forcing him and living vicariously through him\n\nYou\u2019re incredibly judgemental, dismissive and derogatory of your son\u2019s GF. So you\u2019re TAH to her and her family \n\nWhy don\u2019t you like her? Cause so far there\u2019s: \u201cShe disagrees with our faith and opinions\u201d, \u201cshe is beneath him\u201d, \u201c(im an extremely judgemental person and I think) she\u2019s a tramp\u201d.\n\nThe first only falls negatively on you, as it seems you\u2019re the ones with opinions you can\u2019t keep in check. Get over it. \n\nThe second one is neither your call to make AND extremely derogatory\n\nAnd the third one is not even verifiable. She seems like your Bitch Eating Crackers for whatever reason and this is quite literally a You problem, not her.\n\nShe\u2019s not screwing up his future, she\u2019s screwing up your expectation for your son\u2019s future and you can\u2019t handle that. The only person sabotaging your son is you\n\nBUT, there\u2019s one more point. When he finds out,because he WILL find out, you\u2019re the ones that are (RIGHTFULLY) getting cut out of his life. And honestly? Unless you actively change your behaviour and attitude towards her and your son, this might be for the best.", "YTA, when he finds out (and he will) you'll have serious trouble on your hands.

Now your son will realize what a terrible parent you are and hopefully disown you.", "YTA. When your son finds out you did this (which he will) it will damage your relationship with him forever.

If he enlisted in the military, he is an adult.  He asked you to do something simple for him, just do it, whether you agree with it or not.  If the relationship with this girl is a mistake, he needs to find that out for himself and learn from it.  As far as having a lifelong military career, it doesn't sound like that is what he wants, so you shouldn't push it on him.

Or better yet, she\u2019ll get his address from one of his friends and can write to each other about how shitty of a father you are while he\u2019s in bootcamp.

Yeah YTA. You trust your son enough to join the military and go to ~~eat~~ war for this country but not enough for him to make his own decisions about his love life?? Really?

Your judgmental, sexist, slut-shaming, hypocritical a$$ can SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.  Didn\u2019t they teach you that at boot camp?  YOU are not the drill sergeant here, HE is.  JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED.  Didn\u2019t they teach you that at Bible study?  YOU are not God.\n\nGet it?  IT IS NOT YOUR PLACE.  WHEN your son finds out what you\u2019ve done, AND HE WILL FIND OUT, he will NOT drop his GF, HE WILL DROP YOU.  Do you want him to go NC with you for the rest of your life?  No?  THEN GET YOUR GODD*MNED (and yes, I do mean that) NOSE OUT OF HIS BUSINESS.\n\nAgain, you are NOT \u201clooking out for your son\u201d.  Don\u2019t f*cking claim that.  You are trying to CONTROL him, because of what YOU think is right.  If you were TRULY looking out for him, you would give her his address and then be there for him IF the relationship ends.  You aren\u2019t acting out of love, but of HATE.  THAT is why you\u2019re the AH.\n\nYTA", "Exactly. OP wants a clone of themselves. How dare they question things and possibly grow to form their own thoughts", "To add - It's not OP's move to decide on how his son should live his life. These aren't choices he should be making for him. OP sounds controlling and especially prejudiced. It especially rubs me the wrong way that he said the girl is \"bad\" for not being in their same religion. People are allowed to have different perspectives on life and views from you. Enforcing tradition and religion isn't the answer; let him and this girl explore all the questions life has to offer, and come to their own conclusion about what they believe. As long as they're good people and are happy, you should support them. \n\nYTA and I have no idea how you might think otherwise.", "We\u2019ll said! I just want to add; you know what *won\u2019t* help your son focus on his military career? Wondering why his GF of a year *isn\u2019t writing to him* and which other man she\u2019s \u201cshacking up with.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re so concerned about him focusing on his career yet you\u2019re the one providing the biggest distraction. Also, please update us when you discover that one of their mutual friends gave her the address and she informed him that you didn\u2019t bother to honor his request.", "The fundamentalists always like picking and choosing what rules to follow. I guess lying is okay here, right?", "I agree however your child being happy doesn\u2019t always mean you should be happy, some choices kids make aren\u2019t rational such as taking drugs or hanging out with the wrong friend group that will eventually put them in danger. But in this case we don\u2019t have enough information because we don\u2019t know what the gf is like maybe she is a bad influence for his child who knows.", "Well duh. And how dare the girl have opinions of her own! /s\n\nOP, you are a misogynistic asshole. Also, you're delusional if you think he won't find out. This is a reason good enough to go no contact with you. But somehow the parents always keep wondering why their children cut them off, because is couldn't have been anything *they* did, right?", "Truly, it\u2019s so gross.", "100% it\u2019s going to be really funny when he gets back and finds out what happened. They get married and move off to wherever he\u2019s stationed and then NC forever.", "Right!! It\u2019s just so short sited.", "Exactly; they're not goldfish, they're not going to forget each other in a short time and all it will take is one phone call or text for OP to lose control of the situation.\n\nOP might be military but clearly doesn't understand how the onboarding process works.", "This is inevitable.  OP needs to come clean to the son, and the girlfriend, and apologize.  This could permanently damage his relationship with his son.", "lmao so true - he is literally government property now \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 OP YTA.", "It\u2019s not his normal mailing address, it\u2019s a boot camp address, while he\u2019s there (2ish months) he wont have any way to communicate other than mail and the rare phone call and he only learned the mailing address when he got there", ">\tYou trust your son enough to join the military and go to eat for this country\n\nI know this is a typo but it\u2019s really funny.", "Ok, i tought i was the only one! \nLike, we are in 2022, not 1941!

I also didn't know which specific squadron I would be assigned to until I got there, meaning I didn't have my address until after I arrived.

If they are old enough to enlist, they are old enough to choose their relationships, their faith, and their future.", "Exactly this - the son obviously joined the military to escape these parents. And for OP to think a missing address will be enough to keep them apart is ludicrous. There are things like... I don't know, email and phones, for example... they can use to get back in touch after boot camp (if he isn't able to use either method during boot camp).", "\u201cBUT, there\u2019s one more point.

My sister wrote me almost every day. If he does have her address he\u2019d have to wait til he can write a letter, wait for it to go through the postal service, and wait for the reply.
