It can also feel like if they are there over half the time they should start chipping in for rent or chores, and some people are just uncomfortable around constant PDA. Usually, people only don't care about the SO being over a lot if their roommate is also gone a lot to balance it out. \n\nWe don't know from the post how often partners are over and how often they are in shared spaces.

You seem to be an amazing dude :)", "Sometimes you have to wonder, do people really not know the answers to these questions?  \n\nNo, you are NTA.\n\nGreg is TA.\n\nI am thankful you are not writing in to say you excluded your girlfriend at Greg's request! Because then we'd have to tell her to run away.  Good job staying NTA!", "Just leave him alone to drink Baileys out of a shoe.", "Idk\u2026 he is generally a very nice person and seemed very nervous to even bring up the concept in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s saying \u201chey can they not come over?\u201d It seems like a big deal for him to ask", "He just sounds like an incel", "Probably avoid the downstairs mixup though", "Or some bathtub mint julips", "I think the \"incel\" label is tossed around too much. Greg sounds more like an extreme introvert, possibly part-way on the spectrum. He doesn't have a good set of social skills, and needs to work on those more.", "Oh, Greg is definitely *a* catch, just not *the* catch. He honestly sounds more like something you chop up and throw in the chumbucket. NTA", "Lol. Ouch!", "You described him in a pretty bad light and are now surprised that people are responding this way?", "NTA tell Greg seeing him be such a depressing slob is really making you feel bad and you'd appreciate if he could not be around when he gets like that's.", "NTA. Remind Greg it's your birthday too.", "Greg needs therapy.\n\nNTA.", "Wrong question. NTA but could handle this better.  \n\nYou know this about Greg.  Do you value your friendship, and what is important to you?   Next time, beforehand - \n\nYou can offer to spend time with him - a lunch or a coffee, on your shared birthday.  \n\nOr\n\nYou can offer him, 'your choice - me and my gf will be here at the party, or we'll do something else for my birthday if you don't want her here.'  (That is, right now we're a package deal.) \n\nOr\n\nYou can just inform him, your gf is coming because she's you want her there. Then he can live with it, or leave himself.  \n\nUnless you're planning to make Greg your life partner, it is best for both of you to establish early on (now) your independence and right to make choices to make yourself happy.  If this makes him miserable, he needs the therapy - don't adopt his issues as your life problems.", "NTA Greg needs to seek help for his anxiety and other issues, or celebrate his birthday on a different day.  It's not acceptable to demand you don't invite your gf.", "You're NTA. It's your place, too. He shouldn't get to dictate who you all have over for guests.", "NTA. Greg doesnt get to gatekeep your birthday. \n\nAlso, WTF no wonder he is single.", "NTA - he doesn't get to control other people.", "Greg needs to get over it, you pay rent and live there too and it\u2019s also your birthday. Not just his.", "Hmm it\u2019s a wonder why Greg has trouble keeping a relationship/s. It\u2019s your birthday too, why is only Greg to be catered too? NTA", "NTA. Does your pal Greg seem to resent women who don't date him? Make remarks about how women don't like \"nice guys\"? \n\nGreg's behavior is very concerning.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your birthday too! You should be able to invite your own GF.", "Maybe Greg is more into you then a gf. NTA but I think your roommate has a crash on you", "Starting to see why he's single. NTA", "NTA. Greg needs to honor his birthday by acting like an actual adult instead of a sulky child. \n\nYour partner is not a symbol of Greg\u2019s romantic failures. She\u2019s an actual person and Greg needs to treat her like a person.", "I'm going to be the Minority Report on this: YWNBTA if this was clearly dealt with when initially raised, but YTA if you dodged/fudged the initial awkward convo with Greg. \n\nGreg sounds insecure, petty & juvenile, but the correct response when someone asks you not to bring the GF\\* is either 1) Call out your friend for being ridiculous and clearly explain that you are bringing the GF; 2) Dump Greg; or 3) Dump the GF. \\*At least if there is no obvious and very, very good reason for his request... INFO - do they hate each other for some reason?\n\nI just don't get how this situation actually happened. He made the unreasonable request beforehand and it should have been dealt with beforehand.", "If you agreed with G and told him you wouldn't and then did, then YTA. If you were upfront with G and told him your plans, NTA", "Bless you", "\ud83e\udd23", "I have several medical issues, some made me skeletal, hair falling out, skin bad....I never let my insecurities dictate control of those around me. I'm on meds that have me fat now. Still in constant pain. Skin still dry, chapping in places, but, hey. Life. I have BPD, and panic attacks among other things. I don't use those as crutches either. All my dating experiences left me either terribly abused, or cheated on. I quit dating, but know what? I love seeing my friends find and get their happiness in loving relationships. If your flatmate was any sort of person, he should be more happy you guys have found that happiness. There's more than just pairing up, after all.  \nBeing miserable like that will keep him from finding a happy and healthy dating life. I really suggest therapy and a look at himself, but not physically. It doesn't actually matter, contrary to what talk shows and movies say.", "I absolutely agree! Greg is definitely the issue in this scenario.", "NTA. You guys need to celebrate b'day separately or you need new flatmate.", "NTA - Its his problem and he needs to sort it out himself. Pushing it onto you is stupid and toxic.\n\nNext time, say you don't want to celebrate your birthday because you feel down so he shouldn't celebrate his since its also the same day.", "NTA. This falls well outside of reasonable requests.", "Greg might secretly be in love with you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday too. Greg needs to stop being pathetic and grow the fuck up.", "NTA. Not your fault he\u2019s too anxious to be around girls and making you guys suffer the consequences. Sounds like Greg needs to live alone if he wants no company over.", "NTA Greg is an adult and him being single is his own issue. He can\u2019t act like everyone else is single.", "NTA", "NTA Sounds like a Greg problem", "If you don't want to upset poor Greg, change your (not his) birthday party to a restaurant, bar, or your girlfriend's place. And don't invite Greg, because you don't want to hurt his feelings.", "Greg needs help and not for his friends to give up their partners.  Greg needs a therapist.\n\nNTA", "NTA understanding a bit why Greg is single now.", "NTA &nbsp;\n\nthere is an epidemic of people trying to make the world adhere to their internal issues.", "NTA\n\nIf Greg wasn\u2019t such a fun-sponge maybe he\u2019d have a partner.\n\nI can\u2019t believe his audacity in telling you not to invite your gf to your bday. Greg needs to grow up and realise that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him.", "NTA. Greg needs therapy.", "NTA. It's your birthday too and it would be weird for you to not have your girlfriend there. He sounds like he needs some help there.", "Greg needs to sort himself out if he is going to be OK in the real world.\n\nNTA.", "I rule you\u2026NTAH. Greg needs to grow the fuk UP.", "NTA", "NTA. Obviously", "Yeah, NTA. He needs to grow up and start working on his issues. If so, maybe next time he'll actually have a SO of his own to bring.", "You should a hit him right back with a your gonna ruin my bday if i can't invite my gf\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640", "NTA.  Greg needs to deal with reality.  Asking you not to have your gf at your own birthday is unacceptable.", "This. OP, if there is a quiet moment where you can talk to Greg and possibly gently suggest therapy, do it. He doesn't sound like a bad guy, but it sounds like he needs more help than he's getting.", "Problem is, no one wants Greg's thing \ud83e\udd23", "Throw it back!", "NTA. That was a ridiculous, unreasonable request", "NTA. \n\nGreg is working hard on setting himself up for being even more alone. Soon he'll have neither partner nor friends.", "NTA \n\nSounds like he is in love with you and not ready to come out yet", "You are all enabling very bad behavior and he needs theeapy", "NTA. Your roommates neuro-divergence is not your responsibility.", "NTA - Stop accommodating his childish behaviour and he might actually grow. His relationship status is not your problem.", "And paint him a real close up picture.", "Just because it was genuine, and difficult to ask doesn't make it reasonable. \n\nHe's asking you to treat him as more important than your GF, at her exclusion. It's completely inappropriate. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he were an incel based on the info you provided. \n\nAs others suggested, set boundaries around future birthdays and let him know that if it's a problem, he should celebrate separately.", "Because he should be nervous about it since it's a ridiculous thing to ask? \n\nThe only time it would be appropriate is if it was a specific person he had a safety concern with (i.e. your gf is actually trying to boil a rabbit on his stove), and then he needs to use his words to explain why.", "Right? Like, I wonder why he doesn\u2019t have a partner? Like, these qualities that make dating difficult for him\u2026 what could they possibly be?\n\nNTA, OP. It may be time to stop having joint birthdays if he can\u2019t handle letting you have your partner over. What a strange request."]}
