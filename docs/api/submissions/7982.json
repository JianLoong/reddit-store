And our partners visit us and are generally friendly with everyone.\n\nGreg is a great guy, but has some qualities that make dating difficult for him. In addition he is also a very anxious person. This has manifested in him getting down whenever multiple partners are at the place at one time. I get it, he feels like he has no one himself.\n\nOn a few occasions he has asked for people to not have partners over etc, which they have complied with or gone to their partners place instead.\n\nNow, Greg and I share a birthday, i\u2019m sure you can see where this is going.\n\nWe\u2019ve known each other a few years and have always done a joint birthday party. I wasn\u2019t with my GF last year and so I brought a girl i was seeing at the time. This upset him somewhat, because it\u2019s \u201chis day too\u201d\n\nBasically, Greg asked me to not invite my GF this time.\n\nBut I did, and he was obviously upset all day. Apparently I ruined his Birthday because I brought my GF, please bear in mind, other people with partners came too.

You need a new flatmate. \n\nGreg is miserable, and he wants you to be miserable too. \n\nHe should get a GF or leave you alone.\n\nNTA", "NTA. his triggers are not your responsibility. you're all being more than accommodating. he needs counseling.", "F*ckin Greg\u2026 YNTA", "NTA (you\u2019re a birthday person, you should be able to bring your partner even if none of the other guest so) but why are you having a joint party with this guy?!", "NTA. It's your birthday too. This was a weird request on his part.", "NTA what a shitty person to insist you not have your girlfriend around on your birthday.", "Definitely NTA!\nI get Greg\u2019s discomfort, but that discomfort should not manifest into outright emotional blackmail. He\u2019s being so controlling and gross imo.", "Are you sure Greg doesn't have a thing for you or your gf?\n\nHe needs to get over himself regardless.\n\nNTA and happy birthday \ud83c\udf82", "NTA, it's your birthday too. That's an unreasonable demand. If he's uncomfortable he can celebrate his birthday separately.", "NTA - sounds like you and Greg need to start celebrating your birthday separately. His request is not reasonable.", "Greg is completely unreasonable. He\u2019s projecting his sadness and insecurities on all of y\u2019all, y\u2019all shouldn\u2019t be letting him, now he feels entitled to control your relationship? This would infuriate me. \n\nI\u2019d suggest all of y\u2019all sit him down and talk to him about how he can no longer tell you guys when you can and can\u2019t bring your partners over, and encourage him to get some help.", "NTA\n\nGreg needs to go find himself a good therapist, because he has issues, and this is not an acceptable request.", "NTA.\n\nGreg's problem is something Greg needs to work on. His insecurities have already burdened your roommates, and it's time to stop enabling him.", "NTA...the world doesn't revolve around Greg. If he has a problem, he's free to hold his own party apart from yours.", "NTA.\n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t have done a joint party if you know he is going to be upset about partners.\n\nAlso is not you problem others insecurities..", "NTA\n\nBut no wonder Greg is single. He is miserable and controlling. Like it highly unreasonable to ask that. And you guys have indulged him. He is an incel walking.\n\nI'm sure him being single is his own fault and not just bad luck.", "NTA\nYou have every right to be happy on your birthday and every other day. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re being a dick. Greg needs to learn how to deal with his own shit.", "NTA", "NTA. Great guy this Greg. \"I don't have a GF so I don't want to see you have one either\". That would be unacceptable from a sibling or parent you live with, let alone from a flat mate.", "Yeah NTA and you should probably celebrate your birthdays separately from now on. It's your birthday to and asking to celebrate without your significant other is unreasonable. You maybe could have talked it out with him before tho and given him a heads up that you won't give into his request (sounds like you just ignored it).", "NTA. Of course you\u2019re gonna invite your girlfriend.", "NTA. Next year skip the joint party (or just do some quick drinks before parting ways). You should obviously spend your birthday with your partner.", "NTA. It's super frustrating to deal with someone who does absolutely *nothing* to improve their scenario but also you can't tell them shit without them blowing up about x,y, or Z. Fuck that. I know someone like this who is so fucking sensitive a simple comment will send him throwing his shit on the ground and storming off. Grown ass man.", "NTA. Greg needs to have a word with himself", "INFO: what are these \u201cqualities\u201d that make dating hard for him? I\u2019m guessing there is some overlap with the way he is treating you and your flat mates.", "NTA. He's being ridiculous. That's a double standard.  If he's that insecure he needs therapy.", "NTA We also have Greg in our friendgroup. However, we sometimes do not invite partners bc we do not want to give her the feeling to be left alone. Sometimes we bring partners, too. She would say it is ok  but we try to balance it out and be considerate.\nBut as I said, that is coming from us. She would never demand that. It is you birthday, too.", "NTA. It\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s problem that he doesn\u2019t have a partner, he can\u2019t expect everyone to not have their partners at their place just because he doesn\u2019t have one", "NTA, Greg needs to deal with his own issues. No wonder he is single, desparation and weird assumptions don't look appealing at all.", "NTA. he needs to get a grip.", "NTA and Greg has some issues he needs to work out. You basically said dude is an incel.", "NTA.  You would have been if you hadn\u2019t invited your girlfriend.  \n\nIf may have helped if you had explained to him that you were going to invite her and why.  Unless, of course, you did and he was upset anyway in which case, not much you can do.", "Greg is the asshole. And an envious one.
