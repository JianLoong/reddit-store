{"id": 19905, "submission_id": "14buhds", "title": "AITA for ruining our trip by not say or do anything?", "selftext": "My gf and I recently went on a 2 days trip for hiking. On the first day we did a moderate hike (2h) with most of the hike going down. Because of that I suggested we hike up (and take the cable car down) on the 2nd day to spare our knees and workout our leg muscle instead. She agreed and I found a trail that looks just about right for us (2h moderate level) considering her fitness level (moderate) and what I know she is comfortable with (no steep or challening trails like very narrow) I shared with her all the details (length, which route to go etc.) the night before and she was okay with it.\n\nOn the 2nd day when we were at the starting point she saw the mountain (where we were going to hike up to) she was a bit uncomfortable and expressed that it looks sort of high and steep. (Now I need to mention that she has a tendency of being overly cautious and let it get to her head. But I'm obviously not going force her to do anything she does not want to). So I asked her whether she'd like to hike down instead she said yes. So we took the cable car up. On the way up I saw a map with all the trails and noticed the most popular trail (with the best view) was 6h and suggested we take that one instead. She was hesitant as it would go on a ridge (but safe IMO as most people take this trail) but at the end she wanted to take the one we decided yesterday (2h) but going down now since we already took the cable car up.\n\nI was disappointed as I believed strongly we could manage the 6h trail. Now we were hiking down the trail instead as planned going up. So I told myself to suck it up go with it even though I wasn't really looking forward to it.\n\nBefore we started to hike down she asked if we were good and I said yes. Sensing that I was disappointed with the decision she asked if we can hug and I said I didn't feel like it. The hike then went on with each of us just minding our hike mostly. At the end she told me I ruined the trip by making it about me by letting my frustration out on her (I haven't done or said anything to her on the whole way down). I told her that I was not really enjoying the hike down so I wasn't really feeling all sunshine.\n\nShe assumes I was grumpy and blamed her for the situation (which I didn't say anything like that at all). It was just quiet hike down with nothing exchanged between us and now she blames me for ruining the trip.

That\u2019s it. And sometimes plans change because someone is more tired or scared than planned.\n\nFeeling disappointed is ok. Letting your disappointment sour the day is not. Did you seriously refused to hug her because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing the 6h trail? Dude, come on.", "YTA \n\nIt is not bad to be \u201coverly cautious\u201d when hiking. I\u2019m sure she knows her limits and while it can be great to push ourselves, safety is the priority in nature. Always match the hike to the athletic level of the least athletic person in the group. \n\nYou might not have said anything direct, but obviously you were visibly upset and barley spoke to her (if at all) on the way down. How could she not feel like you were blaming her? \n\nAlso, who the hell plans for a 2h hike and then goes \u201cactually let\u2019s do 6!\u201d I love hiking in all terrain and have done days long trips and even I\u2019d have to put a stop to that one. Only do what you\u2019re prepared for.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend knows her limits. Chances are if she gave in and pushed herself, that could have caused more problems, which by your reaction here would have left you being annoyed as well. There's a huge difference between a 2 hour and a six hour hike. \n\nWere you all even prepared for a six hour hike? Probably not.", "YTA. You acted like a grumpy child who didn\u2019t get their way. You two were planning on a two hour hike, it makes total sense she didn\u2019t want to triple the length of the hike on a whim. If you\u2019re hiking with someone else you need to not push them beyond what they\u2019re comfortable with and it\u2019s absurd that you couldn\u2019t enjoy the exact same hike because it was downhill instead of uphill. Apologize for your attitude.", "YTA \n\nAs a confident/competent hiker who has bitten off more than they can chew, you sir are an asshole for  pressuring your gf into hiking trials she wasn\u2019t comfortable doing not just once but twice. Even if she *could* have handled it physically, the fact she wasn\u2019t comfortable would have made it a dangerous or just unpleasant experience.\n\nAlso, if you were only planning on a 2hr hike, did you even bring enough gear for a 6hr hike? Along a ridge line? Those are two very different hikes. Based on facts presented, you don\u2019t actually know how difficult the 6hr one is and just because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s comfortably doable for even a moderate hiker.\n\nYou did ruin the trip, and your gf has every right to be upset with you. Hopefully her next hiking companion is an adult and not a pouty child.", "YTA just because you \u201cdidn\u2019t do or say anything to her the whole way down\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t sense your bad attitude. You said you were good and then let your sourness ruin the entire two hour hike. The point of the trip is to enjoy time together with your girlfriend and you did ruin it. If you want to workout your glutes go to the gym.", "YTA - sounds like you threw a little temper tantrum because you didn't get your way. It's a hike together, so she should be allowed to express her concerns about a pathway she's not comfortable with.", "*Sensing that I was disappointed with the decision she asked if we can hug and I said I didn't feel like it.* \r  \n\r  \nAnd then you didn't interact with her much on the way down.\n\n\r  \nYTA!  \n\nAnd an insufferable AH at that.", "Softly, YTA. Holding in your disappointment and not communicating that is a path to resentment especially when she provided an opportunity for you to discuss how you were feeling by asking if you and her were okay and requesting a hug. She could tell you were upset and tried to talk to you about it but you chose to suck it up which does neither of you any good. While its understandable you'd want to maybe have some time to discuss it later, this should be said. Telling her youre not okay right now and just need some time and you will talk to her about it later could have relieved the tension. Be honest with yourself and her, your need to communicate your needs will never go away in a relationship, it's best to practice doing it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Start respecting your girlfriend and stop throwing temper tantrums.\n\nYTA", "Super soft yta- I get why you were disappointed because the trip turned out really different than what you planned and were looking forward to. The problem is you gave in to her concerns when she was uncomfortable(good), told her it was okay(also good), then iced her (or pouted) for the rest of the day- not great. Even though you didn't explicitly say anything, she could feel it. I would guess you are more experienced and she is a beginner to hiking? Could have seen this coming, man, and just resigned yourself to an easy walk in the woods.", "Somebody did something like this on a backpacking trip I was on. I wound up needing to do a different route than planned, a route I knew one of them didn't want to do, and I offered to split off and take on whatever inconvenience I incurred for my change. They went off to discuss what they wanted to do (it was a couple I was with for that section of the trip). They said they'd change to stay with me, but the husband sulked the whole next day and it was really uncomfortable.

I\u2019m a vastly worst hiker than my partner. He chooses trails that I can do and then if he still have energy he does some solo trail and I just read a book in a refuge.\n\nSimilarly, I am a way better skier than him.
