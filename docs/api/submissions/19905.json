Because of that I suggested we hike up (and take the cable car down) on the 2nd day to spare our knees and workout our leg muscle instead. She agreed and I found a trail that looks just about right for us (2h moderate level) considering her fitness level (moderate) and what I know she is comfortable with (no steep or challening trails like very narrow) I shared with her all the details (length, which route to go etc.) the night before and she was okay with it.\n\nOn the 2nd day when we were at the starting point she saw the mountain (where we were going to hike up to) she was a bit uncomfortable and expressed that it looks sort of high and steep. (Now I need to mention that she has a tendency of being overly cautious and let it get to her head. But I'm obviously not going force her to do anything she does not want to). So I asked her whether she'd like to hike down instead she said yes. So we took the cable car up. On the way up I saw a map with all the trails and noticed the most popular trail (with the best view) was 6h and suggested we take that one instead. She was hesitant as it would go on a ridge (but safe IMO as most people take this trail) but at the end she wanted to take the one we decided yesterday (2h) but going down now since we already took the cable car up.\n\nI was disappointed as I believed strongly we could manage the 6h trail. Now we were hiking down the trail instead as planned going up. So I told myself to suck it up go with it even though I wasn't really looking forward to it.\n\nBefore we started to hike down she asked if we were good and I said yes. Sensing that I was disappointed with the decision she asked if we can hug and I said I didn't feel like it. The hike then went on with each of us just minding our hike mostly. At the end she told me I ruined the trip by making it about me by letting my frustration out on her (I haven't done or said anything to her on the whole way down). I told her that I was not really enjoying the hike down so I wasn't really feeling all sunshine.\n\nShe assumes I was grumpy and blamed her for the situation (which I didn't say anything like that at all).

You two were planning on a two hour hike, it makes total sense she didn\u2019t want to triple the length of the hike on a whim. If you\u2019re hiking with someone else you need to not push them beyond what they\u2019re comfortable with and it\u2019s absurd that you couldn\u2019t enjoy the exact same hike because it was downhill instead of uphill.

Along a ridge line? Those are two very different hikes. Based on facts presented, you don\u2019t actually know how difficult the 6hr one is and just because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s comfortably doable for even a moderate hiker.\n\nYou did ruin the trip, and your gf has every right to be upset with you.

Holding in your disappointment and not communicating that is a path to resentment especially when she provided an opportunity for you to discuss how you were feeling by asking if you and her were okay and requesting a hug. She could tell you were upset and tried to talk to you about it but you chose to suck it up which does neither of you any good. While its understandable you'd want to maybe have some time to discuss it later, this should be said. Telling her youre not okay right now and just need some time and you will talk to her about it later could have relieved the tension.

The problem is you gave in to her concerns when she was uncomfortable(good), told her it was okay(also good), then iced her (or pouted) for the rest of the day- not great. Even though you didn't explicitly say anything, she could feel it. I would guess you are more experienced and she is a beginner to hiking?

By this point he was getting frustrated, and declined (well within his rights to do so), and just retreated into his head to complete the hike. \n\nBut apparently wanting to just keep his thoughts to himself and not say something he might later regret is acting like a child.

The behavior he displayed sets unhealthy precedents in the future where she may not feel comfortable being honest about her boundaries and limits because she\u2019s afraid he will be upset with her. I doubt he\u2019s doing that on purpose, but he needs to learn self-regulation and communication.", "Happy Cake day ! He is allowed to be quiet.

I believe it would help you by getting her perspective more thoroughly, so you can understand why she is upset and how to prevent this in the future by making your thought process less self-centered. \n\nTalking about how you actually feel with her and talking in general, possibly finding compromises better so both of you have what you want to be satisfied, would also do good so there isnt resentment between you two.", "Thank you!

Talking for the sake of talking is not healthy communication. Seems to me like this is the first time he\u2019s shown her when he\u2019s disappointed and she can\u2019t handle it.

I'm way more athletic and outdoorsy, but my fiance wants to do everything together. In our first 4 years we had some days like yours, and both sides share some fault in these cases. While there's nothing wrong with your disappointment and your desire to close yourself off, it is not compatible with her emotional needs. She assumes a problem means there's something wrong with her or her actions which is tricky for you because you can't prove to her that you're upset at the situation and not her. She also wants to immediately make up to make herself feel better even if you aren't ready, and that feels performative and like you'd be giving up bodily autonomy.    \n\nOur couples counselor had to help us with this. I have learned to communicate more in the moment to ensure we understand the situation (both the context and our feelings about it). I'll also hug her when I don't feel ready. Yes, it's quite a compromise on my end, but it's a small price to pay to give my life partner some peace of mind. Often I do feel a little better because her hugs help me handle the disappointment. If you don't find this is the case, you're probably mad at her.   \n\nHer job is to stop interpreting those interactions to mean she isn't good enough or that I'm pissed at her. That's mostly for her and her therapist to figure out due to her lifelong history of feeling inadequate, but I help when I can. She also has accepted that I'll be doing the more \"extreme\" trips without her. It means we do far less hiking and kayaking together, but those aren't key activities to our relationship.   \n\nThese aren't perfect compromises. We're always tweaking the way we handle our differences. I'm usually bored out of my mind during her preferred hikes unless we talk, so we talk. Yeah I'd rather do other shit, but I'm still with her. She's also a little salty everytime I leave without her, but we both know she really just wishes we shared another major interest. It's probably healthier that we keep some things separate anyway. Balance and all that good stuff.\n\nIf you want to do things she won't do, plan to do them without her. If there's even a tiny chance she won't do it and you don't think you'll handle disappointment well, plan something more in her comfort zone.

Your refusal to offer her a few seconds of comfort likely felt to her like you were punishing her for not doing what you wanted to do, and it ruined the entire trip for her because now it'll be the main thing she remembers. As a female, when I need affection and/or reassurance from my husband after a disagreement or whatever, I would feel completely rejected if he refused and it would make me feel like complete trash. Expecting someone to suddenly switch to a 6 hour hike from a 2 hour is insane.

GTFOH.\n\nIf my SO wants to do an activity I'm not comfortable with, I'll be the first to say, \"I'm not feeling it today but by all means, go by yourself and I'll meet you at the top.\" Likewise, if they accomodate my needs and patiently takes the easy route knowing they would probably be happier taking the harder route, I'll be thankful, not bitter.\n\nTo say you ruined the trip because you sacrificed your desire for adventure to accomodate my lack of self confidence on our shared holiday? Yeah, that's not just lack of confidence in hiking but gaslighting that she didn't really want to be there in the first place but lacks the confidence to clearly communicate she doesn't really like hiking and if it's something you enjoy, confident enough to let you go and do on your own.\n\nIt's borderline ESH because OP could have spoke up themselves or communicated more fully how much hiking means to them, but so should GF that she doesn't really enjoy it before they plan a trip together to specifically to do so.", "NTA you tried to get over it and not let it affect the hike. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work as well  as you thought. \n\n+1 for trying to keep your disappointment to yourself, \n-1 for lying to her that you were good in the first place, \n+2 for informed options, \n+1 for accepting her comfort level.\n\nYou can always be honest that tell you were disappointed and you were trying to keep it to yourself and hide that from her.", "I hate sulkers.\nGood grief", "That\u2019s a good point I didn\u2019t actually catch that the one he wanted was 6h instead of 2h.

Again, he knew she would be and it's not like she just suddenly had these feelings, which even if this was out of the blue, it's her right not to do what she doesn't want to do.\n\nIf it were me and my hiking companion had these issues and even explained they were sore/didn't look 100% from the 2 hr hike the previous day, I would have offered to ride back down as well and then relax. Nature isn't forgiving and I would be worried about needing help on a 2 hr hike much less a 6 hr hike.

I do agree he was a bit assholish though.", "Also a 6h trail is a significantly harder hike than a 2h one,  I love hiking but would never do that long of a hike on a whim.

A conversation goes both ways. She didn\u2019t say anything either so she is just as much at fault. \n\nNot to mention that he took care of everything and made sure it would be comfortable and safe for her level. She got anxiety and sometimes you have to push through that a little", "Right. Any physical activity where you're bringing someone along unless the explicit agreement is to push each other to their physical limits, the rule is you go as fast and far as the entire group is comfortable. \n\nHiking may seem pretty manageable and often is but in truth it's high risk, especially if you don't do it often and don't truly know what you can handle. People often overestimate their ability and get in trouble, whether it's a lack of preparation with enough water, wrong footwear causing problems, or just flat out being in worse physical shape than they assumed.

He wasn't trying to make her feel bad, he didn't say she did anything wrong, he wasn't punishing her, he was just disappointed and didn't want a hug. Since we're all sharing our experiences, it's taken me years of therapy to understand I get to be mad and sad and frustrated too. I have as much right to feel negative emotions as everyone else does, and I can deal with them in my own time, as everyone else does, instead of just burying and dismissing it as fast as I can so I can manage someone else's feelings. \n\nSometimes two people want different things. He respected that she didn't want to do the hike even though he was disappointed. She sensed his mood and felt guilty, so she asked for a hug to make *herself* feel better.

We did an alpine start in Nevada one time at Great Basin, and I gave up 3/4 quarter of the way up. I had a nap, he went to the peak and collected me on the way down. \n\nI also once spent 11 hours at a caf\u00e9 at the foot of Mt.Olympus while he went up and down again. I had unlimited Greek salad ans books, and he had a terribly exhausting day, and we were both quite happy at the end.", "Yeah, I agree with this. There have been times that I'm not ok with a hug. No one should feel forced to be in bodily contact with someone if that's not what they want.", "Sure, but then don't deny you are in a bad mood. That's the reason why OP is the asshole. She communicated with him several times, as per his own story, and he did not communicate once.\n\nIt's okay to be in your feelings, but just *say it*. \"I'm disappointed, I was looking forward to this\". Maybe they could have talked it out and would have reached a compromise, like adults. Instead he decided to be grumpy and brooding, and got mad that she noticed.

Even if OP wasn\u2019t feeling a hug he could have reassured her that things between them were ok.", "I went to Colorado with a friend who is 10 X fitter than me.

Their partner was already doing something that they likely were less enthusiastic about but went along cause they wanted OP to be happy.\n\nLike I'm not very big on swimming. I still bring trunks and get in the water cause my partner likes to swim. If she gave me shit for not moving around enough or not getting out in deeper water than I feel okay in I'd be so fucking done lol. Like I'm only out here to spend time with you doing something you like! I'm actively trying to share this with you, why make it shitty for me?", "He offered this choice. She chose. Then he refused physical reassurance and all communication because she chose a thing that made him upset.\n\nHe didn't talk to her about being upset.\n\nHe didn't interact with her.\n\nShe tried to talk to him and he stonewalled real communication.\n\nHe took the less-preferred of his options and preferred of hers, and, instead of enjoying what he could, knowing he can't have it all his own way all the time, and making the best of it, he acted like a whiny, silly child.\n\nIf you are upset, you say so. It sounds like his gf would have expressed genuine gratitude for him doing it anyway. If he had actually allowed them to communicate. But, by his own admission, he was avoiding communication. He was using toxic coping mechanisms to her making the wrong choice of two options *he provided*. This is just a short path over a long path. Not the end of the world or the death of a puppy. Hopefully something a pair in a healthy relationship could talk about and work out compromise or other options.\n\n There was lots to still enjoy about the day: mainly, hanging out with his gf doing a thing she was enjoying.

No one has to hug anyone, but combine that with silent treatment and saying \"we're fine\" with your mouth and the opposite with your actions is shitty. Childish at best, manipulative at worst.

If the girlfriend came on here and said I was stuck on this hiking trip with my boyfriend who tried to change our plans and wasn\u2019t happy when I didn\u2019t go along with it.  I would still say NAH. If she went on to say she was too afraid to try to talk it out I\u2019d tell her she should leave any relationship if she didn\u2019t feel safe.  If she told us she was too pissed to talk and decided to blame him, I might tell her she\u2019s an AH.  We could speculate all day about her feelings, but we don\u2019t have that info here.  Going off what I know from the info provided I say NAH.  Some people need time to cool off before furthering a discussion without escalating it. For all we know she could have blown up at OP for trying to talk before she was ready.

Sometimes it\u2019s not. Depends on many factors related to specifics.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my way of handling things because I don\u2019t really mind confrontation, but if it\u2019s clear someone is not happy with me I would absolutely address it before it had time to fester.

I watched this poor man (who seemed fit enough but not especially muscular or tall) sigh like this had happened before, and hoist 70+ pounds of dead weight to carry him home.

It may be wise to plan a route she can solo. \n\nSecond, you should commend your girlfriend for speaking up and having a voice. She did the right thing.

On the way down, you said nothing and just focused on the trail. She already felt your energy and disappointment. Your body language speaks too. On a trek just increasing your pace and her behind you sends loads of message. You not talking sends loads of message. You were behaving immaturely to show you weren't happy.

Not a ton of extra space but I wouldn\u2019t take much more than water, a snack & maybe dry socks for 2h under a lift line where you can wave for help.", "You could be onto something here in regards to who has the power. She may not have felt safe telling him off until she was off the hiking path and back at base. It sounded to me the disagreement happened close to the cable car and that could have been an escape that didn\u2019t cause her to rely on OP.   Maybe his silence was petty and aggressive and hers was fear based.  We will never know her thoughts unless she posts also. Again tho if this is the case they have bigger problems than who ruined the trip and I would encourage OP to make sure their girlfriend did not feel scared of him in any way.   \n\nThe saltiness on her part was inferred from her silence, but it\u2019s true we don\u2019t know her reasoning.  Silence, while powerful, is not usually seen as aggression unless someone is conditioned to perceive it as such.  Many people regard silence as the person being passive or passive-aggressive.  In which case the silence from both parties could be seen as manipulative.", "Expecting someone who is clearly upset to talk to you and being upset they don\u2019t can also be called agressive behaviour. She feels guilty and she\u2019s upset and wants him to make her feel better. He\u2019s upset and wants to sulk a bit. They\u2019re not assholes, they\u2019re humans having feelings.", "If he'd just said, \"I'm disappointed in your choice and I'm not enjoying this, so I don't feel like hugging or chatting,\" that would be fine (or fine-ish, his overall actions of trying to push her into a harder hike still make him the AH). He would have at least been honest about what he's feeling. If he didn't want to talk about it on the hike, he could express that too. Emotionally healthy grownups don't give their partner the silent treatment or take their \"bad mood\" out on their partner. Or say they're \"fine\" when they're in a bad mood and act other than \"fine.\" He can't expect her to read his mind and just know he's not happy.
