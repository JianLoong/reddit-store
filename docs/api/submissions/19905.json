Because of that I suggested we hike up (and take the cable car down) on the 2nd day to spare our knees and workout our leg muscle instead. She agreed and I found a trail that looks just about right for us (2h moderate level) considering her fitness level (moderate) and what I know she is comfortable with (no steep or challening trails like very narrow) I shared with her all the details (length, which route to go etc.) the night before and she was okay with it.\n\nOn the 2nd day when we were at the starting point she saw the mountain (where we were going to hike up to) she was a bit uncomfortable and expressed that it looks sort of high and steep. (Now I need to mention that she has a tendency of being overly cautious and let it get to her head. But I'm obviously not going force her to do anything she does not want to). So I asked her whether she'd like to hike down instead she said yes. So we took the cable car up. On the way up I saw a map with all the trails and noticed the most popular trail (with the best view) was 6h and suggested we take that one instead. She was hesitant as it would go on a ridge (but safe IMO as most people take this trail) but at the end she wanted to take the one we decided yesterday (2h) but going down now since we already took the cable car up.\n\nI was disappointed as I believed strongly we could manage the 6h trail. Now we were hiking down the trail instead as planned going up. So I told myself to suck it up go with it even though I wasn't really looking forward to it.\n\nBefore we started to hike down she asked if we were good and I said yes. Sensing that I was disappointed with the decision she asked if we can hug and I said I didn't feel like it. The hike then went on with each of us just minding our hike mostly. At the end she told me I ruined the trip by making it about me by letting my frustration out on her (I haven't done or said anything to her on the whole way down). I told her that I was not really enjoying the hike down so I wasn't really feeling all sunshine.\n\nShe assumes I was grumpy and blamed her for the situation (which I didn't say anything like that at all).

You two were planning on a two hour hike, it makes total sense she didn\u2019t want to triple the length of the hike on a whim. If you\u2019re hiking with someone else you need to not push them beyond what they\u2019re comfortable with and it\u2019s absurd that you couldn\u2019t enjoy the exact same hike because it was downhill instead of uphill. Apologize for your attitude.", "YTA \n\nAs a confident/competent hiker who has bitten off more than they can chew, you sir are an asshole for  pressuring your gf into hiking trials she wasn\u2019t comfortable doing not just once but twice.

Along a ridge line? Those are two very different hikes. Based on facts presented, you don\u2019t actually know how difficult the 6hr one is and just because it\u2019s popular doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s comfortably doable for even a moderate hiker.\n\nYou did ruin the trip, and your gf has every right to be upset with you.

Holding in your disappointment and not communicating that is a path to resentment especially when she provided an opportunity for you to discuss how you were feeling by asking if you and her were okay and requesting a hug. She could tell you were upset and tried to talk to you about it but you chose to suck it up which does neither of you any good. While its understandable you'd want to maybe have some time to discuss it later, this should be said. Telling her youre not okay right now and just need some time and you will talk to her about it later could have relieved the tension.

The problem is you gave in to her concerns when she was uncomfortable(good), told her it was okay(also good), then iced her (or pouted) for the rest of the day- not great. Even though you didn't explicitly say anything, she could feel it. I would guess you are more experienced and she is a beginner to hiking?

Being angry at her for sticking with your own original plan, because now you dont want to do it anymore, and then giving her the silent treatment for the whole hike for wanting to stick to YOUR suggestion is ridicolous.\n\nHad you packed enough of what you would have needed for the additional 4h? I'm in no way an experienced hiker, but if you had enough in your pack for 4 additional hours, it sounds like you packed too heavy and bulky to begin with. Or you wanted to set out on a hike that was much longer than what you would have had resources for. Neither sounds like something an experienced hiker would do?", "Are you a child? You thought a 6 hour hike was moderate when she had already agreed on a 2 hour hike? That\u2019s insane. You did ruin it by giving the silent treatment because you didn\u2019t get your way. YTA", ">She assumes I was grumpy and blamed her for the situation (which I didn't say anything like that at all). It was just quiet hike down with nothing exchanged between us and now she blames me for ruining the trip. AITA?\n\nINFO: Did you actually blame her?\n\nShe's not the AH for having comfort zones. You're not the AH for being disappointed. The problem here isn't that you guys are assholes, but that you're not actually communicating with each other.", "There\u2019s a huge difference between what I\u2019d pack for a 2-hour hike and a 6-hour hike. If we got some place and saw there was an equally easy trail that was 2 1/2 or 3 hours, yeah, we might push it. Not if it was triple the planned time. That\u2019s when we say \u201cwe\u2019ll see how we feel about that on a different day.\u201d", "Yeah that's ridiculous and just shows OP's immaturity.", "Op would hate me. I get vertigo with the slightest bit of height so overlooks are a no go for me.", "And we are talking on a second day of hiking. Your expecting her to commit to a 6h hike the second day when 2 was the plan and be upset she didn\u2019t? That\u2019s three times the agreed upon time dude. And \u201cI know her better than she knows herself\u201d condescending attitude is a bullshit excuse to not listen to her.", "\"I haven't done or said anything to her on the whole way down\" but can't figure out why his wife felt the trip was ruined. OP is definitely an asshole.", "This.\nI go hiking a lot, with someone who is much more experienced than I am. The SECOND I say \u201cI don\u2019t like this\u201d, we turn back. There is no negotiation, no sulking, we just turn back.\nAnd if I don\u2019t feel like doing something hard, we go to the beach.\nBecause hiking, despite what people believe, can be dangerous and if people don\u2019t trust themselves, it is ABSOLUTELY FINE. \nWe once hiking for 20km to see a waterfall and I made us turn back 100m from the falls because it was steep and slippery and I freaked out.\nHe never said anything mean, we just turned back and lived to see another day.", "I was going to comment but this is the comment. So I'll just say YTA", "He's allowed to be quiet and not hug her", "I wondered this as well, who leaves for a 2 hour hike but is then prepared to be out all day? Also, could have been a lot longer than six if she struggled. Yep, definitely an asshole.", "Mine too. Passive-aggressive af.", "Yep I agree.", "It took me years of being on the receiving end of it to learn that when used often enough, silent treatment can be a form of emotional abuse called stonewalling. It's absolute shit to do to someone. If you need time to yourself before you can address the situation, *express that* to your partner rather than gaslighting them.", "Lmao l love the way you phrased it", "Yeah except she asked for a hug after asking if he was ok, he said he was then obviously wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s not like he said I\u2019m upset and she was like hug me! Sounds more like she wanted to hug it out and move on after he said he was fine, and enjoy the hike together. He could have easily said I\u2019m disappointed we\u2019re not doing the longer hike but he sulked the whole time instead of just being a normal person and saying what he wanted.", ">Her asking for a hug is weird to me. She's not five and should not be in weepy fits over you being mildly disappointed or annoyed.\n\nThank you, scrolled all this way to see if anyone else noticed this. He suggested hiking down to avoid her being overly anxious again, but the 6-HOUR hike was indeed a stupid alternate suggestion. I personally think ESH.", "He planned a 2 hour hike and then changed his mind mid hike and wanted the 6 hours. He's the one who wanted to change the plans, not her.", "Honestly this sounds like a hard YTA to me. It is so deeply shitty to ice someone out after first pretending to be ok with the situation.", "it\u2019s ok to be frustrated. It\u2019s not okay to punish your partner when they take you saying you\u2019re okay to mean you\u2019re okay", "Real big girl pants mean setting boundaries and knowing your own limits, and expressing them accordingly.", ">INFO: Did you actually blame her?\n\nNo I didn't. As I wrote in my post I said we're good as in I am not blaming you for this. But does not change the fact that this is not a hike I wanted to do so I wasn't feeling my best so I didn't felt hugging when she asked. That's all. After we didn't interacted much at all.\n\n>She's not the AH for having comfort zones. You're not the AH for being disappointed. The problem here isn't that you guys are assholes, but that you're not actually communicating with each other.\n\nI agree. I can communicate my needs or feelings better.", "This is why I've never been able to get into hiking and hate going. Everyone I go with always insists on difficult inclines I physically cannot do due to injury and then even if they accept the easier path they're either miserable or they make the group take a secret detour back to the hard trail and I end up unable to walk for the next few days after", "Also like, packing for a two hour hike is not at all the same as packing for a 6h hike in terms of snacks and water and stuff! You can't decide that change on a whim!", ">(Now I need to mention that she has a tendency of being overly cautious and let it get to her head. But I'm obviously not going force her to do anything she does not want to). \n\nHe's decided she's \"overly cautious\" and \"lets it get to her head\" when it sounds like she simply knows and honors her limits. \n\nHe says he's not going to \"force her to do anything she doesn't want to\" but then tries to change the agreed upon 2 hours to 6 hours! \n\nOP, I'd be exhausted by your seemingly passive aggressive and manipulative behavior. You even refuse to give her a hug? Add withholding to the list. YTA.", "Sure, but we are also talking about a 2hr hike which generally wouldn\u2019t be considered moderate", "Fuck that ! - YTA", "Yes, if he communicated his needs and explained why. \u201cHey, I\u2019m a bit overwhelmed at moment. I know it\u2019s not your fault if you don\u2019t feel safe doing the long hike. But I\u2019m a bit in my head at the moment and I feel frustrated. Just let me calm down for a bit\u201d\n\nOtherwise he is just withholding affection as a way to manipulate his partner.", ">So I asked her whether she'd like to hike down instead she said yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I was not in the mood because I did not want to hike down the 2h trail and we went there after all.\n\nBut you were the one who proposed it in the first place.", "Then, after refusing a hug, you stayed silent the whole trail, also known as sulking. You absolutely made things awkward because you didn't get your way", "And yet, here we are.", "Oops, you're right, thank you for the correction. Changes my soft yta to a definite yta (lol)", "you're right, thanks", "How did they punish them?", "I get vertigo with the slightest bit of height so overlooks are a no go for me.", "In that case, the wife was the asshole. Husband didn't want to do it, she made him when it wasn't necessary. His sour attitude is the natural consequence of her voluntelling him what to do.", "I really like this approach. It\u2019s healthy. You both get what you want and need.", "Yes, but there has to be a willingness to adapt. If that is not present in one of the participants then there is going to be conflict. Great that you two are congruent.", "True, we also don't know if she tried to talk to him", "Not telling someone what you want but expecting them to know, then getting mad but again not telling them you\u2019re mad and outright lying and saying you\u2019re okay then again expecting them to know you meant the opposite, then not speaking to them at all is punishment. He was punishing her by not speaking to her  and being grumpy and sulky because she should have known what he wanted and felt without him saying what he means.\n\nEdit: if he said I really wanted to do the longer hike and I\u2019m disappointed we can\u2019t, I\u2019d really like some time alone with my thoughts it would be fine. It\u2019s that he expected her to know that without him saying it that\u2019s the problem and punishment is silent treatment so she just has to guess and feel bad and question the whole thing", "Where did you read the \u201cwife made him do it, when it wasn\u2019t necessary\u201d? We have no idea what they discussed about. What if he felt responsible to accompany the person we are responding to but was still unhappy with his decision? What if the wife just said \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving this person alone on the trail, I\u2019ll go with them\u201d? We don\u2019t know.\n\nYou just made up an entire scenario out of thin air. The only thing we know is that the husband behaved like an AH.\n\n(But I checked your comment history and I have to say I\u2019m not surprise your first interpretation of this situation is \u201cit\u2019s the woman\u2019s fault\u201d)", "Because she would have been the driving factor in them both going", "Not true. \nWe know she did try. OP told so himself:\n\n> Before we started to hike down she asked if we were good and I said yes. Sensing that I was disappointed with the decision she asked if we can hug and I said I didn't feel like it."]}
