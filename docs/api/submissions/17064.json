He never means harm but it gets annoying at times.\n \nDuring dinner to cheer me up, my BIL decided to make some jokes. \nThey were light but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear them. \n\nIt was jokes like: \"It\u2019s kinda a good thing, can you imagine the kid looked like the dad and you had to see his face all the time\", \"Well at least you won\u2019t end up like those moms who have to rely on pills to stay awake\" ect\u2026\n\nHonestly it was maybe innocent jokes and made my mom and sister laugh but it personally made me upset. \n\nI told him to stop the jokes, that i didn\u2019t want to hear them.\n\nHe said in a joking tone: \"Wow is losing your humor a side effect when you lose a baby?\"\n\nWhen he said that I got so mad and sad that I left the table and went to my room.\n\nI heard my sister and BIL leave shortly after that. My mom came to check on me and  told me it was okay and she left me alone for the rest of the day.\n\nBut I received a text from my sister saying that I was disrespectful to stormed out like I did, that my BIL was only trying to cheer me up and make me laugh and I should\u2019ve appreciated his efforts\u00a0.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m feeling bad because I do appreciate them trying to make me feel better but the jokes of my BIL don\u2019t do that. \n\nApparently my sister also texted my mom and told her that they won\u2019t talk to me or come back until i apologize to my BIL and her for being disrespectful.\n\nAnd i wonder, AITA for getting mad at my BIL jokes when he was only trying to make me laugh ?", "created_utc": 1683906774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fowxm/aita_for_leaving_the_table_after_my_bil_made_joke/", "score": 1617, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is a time and place for humour to be used to help someone dealing with something difficult. This was neither. Additionally you had asked him to stop.

A heartfelt and sincere apology is needed and I personally wouldn't speak with your sister or brother in law until he gave you one.  I can't think of any circumstance where losing a baby is funny.

It was boder line bullying and most ladies I know would have called him an AH to his face and told him to f\\*\\*K off after the last joke. Tell your sister that you will respect them once they have some respect for you as what your BIL did was disrespectful and you expect an apology if they want to come to your house ever again.", "I love dark humor, I realy do, but this?

If my husband did that I would be so mortified and be pushing him out the door while apologizing *to* you.

Don't apologize and get rid of that A H of a BIL and spineless sister.", "Not just him, mum and sister both laughed at the 'jokes' they are A H too! \n\nOp is NTA and should take a break from the lot of them.", "True, I've made some dark humor jokes about my own situations and with some friends/family members with our situations but that's only between us. If someone gets offended, we apologize to the other person.", "And the sister too!\n\nNTA", "How dare your sister say YOU disrespected HIM?! What in the world is going on with her. In YOUR house, made inappropriate jokes, you asked him to stop. Instead he keeps going so you leave. You didn\u2019t cuss him out and yell at him, you removed yourself from this jerk\u2019s presence. The gaslighting that is going on here saying you were disrespectful. And \u201cwe\u2019re not coming back until you apologize?\u201d Bye, Felicia! This is a hill I\u2019d die on. No way do you apologize to those jerks! I\u2019m honestly more upset with sister. NTA", "My concern is if the sister is subtly emotionally abused by BIL. If he's this much of an AH *around* people, what does he say to sister to knock her down a couple pegs? I bet he was giving her a hard time and that's why she reacted the way she did.  \n\n\nI could be wrong and she's a major AH too... but you never know.", "It\u2019s only a joke when everyone laughs.", "It shouldn't work before then, either - I mean, sure, you may not know personally, but it is supposed to be up to your parents to ground you so you learn.", "Yea if anything, he should be apologizing to you.", "I've had people make dead baby jokes to me. But even they wouldn't make those jokes when someone had just lost their baby. There's a time and place and audience for dark humor and this is not one of them", "[removed]", "IN HER HOME\u2026WTF??", "And that\u2019s what determines whether it\u2019s a good joke. They are supposed to be funny. If the subject of the joke isn\u2019t amused, it\u2019s definitely not funny.", "I'm sorry but no one who makes jokes about a miscarriage in front of the person who had one means well.  The guy is a bully, plain and simple.", "In addition there seems to be some sort of hint indicating that the father left either while she was pregnant or after the miscarriage. So she's dealing both with the break down of a relationship AND the loss of a child. Sister should be taking a cold hard look at the kind of person she's married to.", "Sometimes I say something like that without thinking and don't always realize how messed up it was until someone explains it to me and/or once I blurt it out, I realize how bad it sounded after it came out of my mouth.\n\nEdit: I do apologize though once I realize it.", "Exactly. Someone explained that gallows humor means when the person on the gallows who's about to be executed makes a joke about it, THAT'S gallows humor. If it was the executioner or someone in the crowd making a joke about it, that's just cruel. The BIL was being an appallingly cruel bully.", "I laugh at anything that's absurd it gets difficult to hold it in when it's inappropriate.", "Same. Sister is disgusting", "That's bullshit. I get not trying to get involved, but here there is so clearly a right and wrong side that being neutral is choosing a side.", "There's absolutely nothing even potentially funny about the last comment.\n\nThe first few jokes sound like they could be meant to be funny, but obviously it's a topic to be careful about and very understandable you told him to stop. And then he lashed out at you in a super hurtful way going over the boundary you just set.", "BIL utterly failed to \"read the room.\"\n\nIf he makes jokes like that at work, he could find himself unexpectedly unemployed with no notice because most companies would consider him a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "Your mom should be willing to take sides in cases like this.", "And the second it is deemed unfunny, the correct response is an apology and change of subject. If he had done so it would have been nah imo, it is human to overstep at times, but at least make the effort to correct it and if she still needs to leave that\u2019s okay!", "True, makes you wonder what else he has said to op in the past.\n\nEdit: More words.", "exactly, in this context the only person who has permission to make miscarriage jokes is the person who had the miscarriage!", "Yea for sure.", "Exactly, does he make \"jokes\" like that to his boss? I don't think so.", "Well here\u2019s a chance to grow beyond your own experiences.\n\nMany people will just standby and watch a bully attack their victim, even in families.", "I like this comment. You absolutely cannot claim him. You would be insulting you and all the other dumbasses in the world, including me! Lol", "Why is it that every time someone is a jokester or prankster, they always end up being an asshole?", "You ain't even being original. Maybe, you're just not funny. Not everyone is.", "A very cool cross over \ud83d\ude01", "I mean, i doubt she was *trying* to hurt OP, and yeah you\u2019re probably right that she thought she was helping. It just seems very overbearing of her to do all of this when OP does not seem to need nor particularly want any of it, and it\u2019s gone pretty poorly (at least the inviting of people bit), and I worry that either OP can\u2019t express boundaries appropriately or that OPs mom might continue overstepping them in an attempt to help"]}
