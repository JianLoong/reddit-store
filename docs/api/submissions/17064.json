He never means harm but it gets annoying at times.\n \nDuring dinner to cheer me up, my BIL decided to make some jokes. \nThey were light but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear them. \n\nIt was jokes like: \"It\u2019s kinda a good thing, can you imagine the kid looked like the dad and you had to see his face all the time\", \"Well at least you won\u2019t end up like those moms who have to rely on pills to stay awake\" ect\u2026\n\nHonestly it was maybe innocent jokes and made my mom and sister laugh but it personally made me upset. \n\nI told him to stop the jokes, that i didn\u2019t want to hear them.\n\nHe said in a joking tone: \"Wow is losing your humor a side effect when you lose a baby?\"\n\nWhen he said that I got so mad and sad that I left the table and went to my room.\n\nI heard my sister and BIL leave shortly after that. My mom came to check on me and  told me it was okay and she left me alone for the rest of the day.\n\nBut I received a text from my sister saying that I was disrespectful to stormed out like I did, that my BIL was only trying to cheer me up and make me laugh and I should\u2019ve appreciated his efforts\u00a0.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m feeling bad because I do appreciate them trying to make me feel better but the jokes of my BIL don\u2019t do that. \n\nApparently my sister also texted my mom and told her that they won\u2019t talk to me or come back until i apologize to my BIL and her for being disrespectful.\n\nAnd i wonder, AITA for getting mad at my BIL jokes when he was only trying to make me laugh ?", "created_utc": 1683906774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fowxm/aita_for_leaving_the_table_after_my_bil_made_joke/", "score": 304, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is a time and place for humour to be used to help someone dealing with something difficult. This was neither. Additionally you had asked him to stop. Continuing to make jokes makes him even more TA. Removing yourself from the situation was the option he left you with since he wouldn\u2019t stop. \n\nDid any of them stop to consider how you actually feel about the situation?

A heartfelt and sincere apology is needed and I personally wouldn't speak with your sister or brother in law until he gave you one.  I can't think of any circumstance where losing a baby is funny.

If you not apologizing will keep them out, then by all means stand your ground unless you want to hear more of these lame jokes. A person cracking the joke needs to learn the audience and after you asking him not to continue, whatever he did is on him. It was boder line bullying and most ladies I know would have called him an AH to his face and told him to f\\*\\*K off after the last joke. Tell your sister that you will respect them once they have some respect for you as what your BIL did was disrespectful and you expect an apology if they want to come to your house ever again.", "I love dark humor, I realy do, but this?

I don't get it.\"\n\nPeople who mean to say something funny apologize when it falls flat and they are called out.

Joking about miscarriage immediately after said miscarriage is one of those things.\n\nTo make me sound horrible and give context, I have been known to drop a joke about deceased before in all contexts. Riding the line between AH and dark humor. Sometimes, it makes me an AH. When that happens, I immediately apologize when I realize my joke did not come off right. That is because even though I did something that is an AH move, I am not an AH. I feel remorse for hurting. And that apology happens after the first joke misses and people look at me like I said something stupid. \n\nTo demand an apology means your BIL is an AH. He didn't do something that was AH behavior.
