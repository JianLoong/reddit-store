He never means harm but it gets annoying at times.\n \nDuring dinner to cheer me up, my BIL decided to make some jokes. \nThey were light but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear them. \n\nIt was jokes like: \"It\u2019s kinda a good thing, can you imagine the kid looked like the dad and you had to see his face all the time\", \"Well at least you won\u2019t end up like those moms who have to rely on pills to stay awake\" ect\u2026\n\nHonestly it was maybe innocent jokes and made my mom and sister laugh but it personally made me upset. \n\nI told him to stop the jokes, that i didn\u2019t want to hear them.\n\nHe said in a joking tone: \"Wow is losing your humor a side effect when you lose a baby?\"\n\nWhen he said that I got so mad and sad that I left the table and went to my room.\n\nI heard my sister and BIL leave shortly after that.

It's one thing to try and lighten the mood with general humour, but not *about* the subject/situation you're trying to distract from with the humour. Jesus. Is he this clueless about everything?", "NTA\n\nThere isn't a single thing about miscarriage that is funny. Your BIL can fuck all the way off.", "NTA and OMG! BiL and sister are insensitive and straight up awful. \n\nI'm so sorry you are dealing with a loss like that. I don't think they should be allowed to visit anytime soon.

There is a time and place for humour to be used to help someone dealing with something difficult. This was neither. Additionally you had asked him to stop. Continuing to make jokes makes him even more TA. Removing yourself from the situation was the option he left you with since he wouldn\u2019t stop. \n\nDid any of them stop to consider how you actually feel about the situation? I can imagine this entire situation is emotional and confusing and on top of that hormones are hell. \n\nI would be upset with my BIL if he did this, but extra upset at my sister for being worried about her thoughtless BF\u2019s bruised ego instead of having empathy for you.", "NTA - your BIL is not only **NOT** funny but a real AH.

NTA\n\nFucking read the room!", "NTA - The comments by your BIL were 1000% inappropriate and disrespectful.

Their reaction proves just how out of touch they are. I'm sure it will be a gift waiting for them to apologize.", "NTA. Cruelty in the guise of humor is still cruelty. He\u2019s a disturbed a-hole and your mother and sister are a-holes for enabling his cruelty. I wouldn\u2019t allow any of them back into my home until they apologize. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting how they treated you. Kick mom to the curb, too.", "No, no, no. Your sister is a massive AH. She needs to check herself and her husband.

And your sister is total toilet water for allowing it to happen.", "I agree with your sister.  A heartfelt and sincere apology is needed and I personally wouldn't speak with your sister or brother in law until he gave you one.  I can't think of any circumstance where losing a baby is funny.  Anyone would know it was in bad taste and hurtful.  I can get that his way of communicating is humor.  For some people, that's how they deal with uncomfortable situations.  But you asked him to stop.  If his objective is to cheer you up, continuing after being told to stop is not appropriate.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing worse than an asshole is an asshole who gets pissed at the folks they upset.\n\nIf it were me, your sister & BIL would either back off of their ultimatum and they would apologize or I\u2019d never have to deal with them again.", "NTA.

If you not apologizing will keep them out, then by all means stand your ground unless you want to hear more of these lame jokes. A person cracking the joke needs to learn the audience and after you asking him not to continue, whatever he did is on him. It was boder line bullying and most ladies I know would have called him an AH to his face and told him to f\\*\\*K off after the last joke. Tell your sister that you will respect them once they have some respect for you as what your BIL did was disrespectful and you expect an apology if they want to come to your house ever again.", "I love dark humor, I realy do, but this? The art of dark humor is knowing when and with who you can share it, so everyone has fun. This was just horrible, I don't have words for it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would not apologize, but if you peel him away from Sus, tell him you don't need jokes, you need support or whatever.  \n\nBTW, my husband is a joke sl^t - never met a joke he didn't like.

Sometimes sadness and trauma have to be processed so we can move forward. But we move through it at our own pace and we even have setbacks sometimes.

And I would have gone back to bed. Everyone could see themselves out - including your mom.\n\nNTA. Apologize? For toughing out one of harshest things that can happen to a human being? Your sister is not being logical.", "NTA\n\nBIL just needs to be the center of attention. You asked him to stop, he was the one who felt the need to continue.", "Nta\nYou asked him to stop. He did not. Very unsympathetic sister and bil to your feelings. Dont ever apologize so they do stay away. They sound toxic", "I hope you find peace and comfort in this difficult time.

They're misogynistic, gaslighting, and abusive comments hurled under the banner of \"it's all a joke\".\n\nWhen these things happen we have to ask the person saying them....  \"Explain to me why it's funny.  I don't get it.\"\n\nPeople who mean to say something funny apologize when it falls flat and they are called out.  People who aim to be mean, calculating, and abusive double down on \"it's just a joke\" and act offended at being called out.\n\nYour mother, brother-in-law, and sister sound incredibly narcissistic.  They are projecting their bad behavior (and the blame) onto you.  But that's not real.  It's not the truth of the matter.  Don't accept it.  See it for the awfulness that it is and discount their opinions, their \"attempts\" at \"helping\", and a bit...  Their feelings on this matter.  Or any matter involving you which they automatically discount.\n\nThere's no need to accept hurtful things from people simply because they have been labeled \"family\".  From your post...
