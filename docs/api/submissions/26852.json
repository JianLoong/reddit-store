She is in a constant state of overwhelm and very easily irritated, constantly complaining how it's all too much. I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high. \n\nShe insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves. \n\nAlso she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work! \n\nI'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair.

There are things a parent has to do for children in the mornings- your youngest is eight. Cereal is nothing but sugar, a lot of moms don\u2019t want their kids to eat that every day. Two hours of screen time is generous, not strict. You sound rather checked out.    YTA", "YTA\nI really wanted to be on your side for this one but nope. Your children are 8 and 10 of course they need help getting up and need a more substantial breakfast than cereal. The 12 year old I could see beginning to get up on their own (emphasis on beginning).

You need to read some books on parenting fr and help your wife out.", "YTA , help her out. Kids require a lot of work that you signed up for when you decided to have kids. Her \u201chigh standards \u201c are literally bare minimum. Every morning she is setting them up for success with no help from you which is why she\u2019s so overwhelmed. Getting three kids ready in the mornings and making sure they are well fed before sending them off to school is such a blessing. The screen time is so reasonable and good that she is encouraging them to be outside and have more of a child hood.

An 8 year old and a ten year old with ADHD are not ready to totally get themselves ready in the morning, and you\u2019d know that if you didn\u2019t sleep through the morning routine every day. Two hours of screen time a day is a totally reasonable boundary. And family time and enriching activities are also important.

Her rules and actions seem sensible. Three young kids getting up and getting themselves to school on their own sounds like a zoo. And morning is a great time to have fun and productive parenting interactions. Two hours of screen time is plenty, and it should not be permitted to displace other activities with strong positives such as reading and free play.

Your wife is essentially trying to enact boundaries and maintain a routine for 3 kids, while you are not backing her up. It has to be monumentally frustrating for her to manage 3 middle/elementary school age kids on her own. A lot of that stress is probably because she IS asking you to help, and because you don't see why you should have to do these things, then she's stuck organizing and corralling the kids by herself. \n\nShe probably wants to take the kids to the museum because it's fun for the kids, and you're doing that non-committal \"I don't see why we have to do this so I don't want to do it\" so then it's all about YOU and not about the kids at all. It's majorly invalidating her feelings and her position as a parent.\n\nWhat are you doing right now, in terms of helping the kids, that makes you an active and engaged parent? While I read this post, I could just see the situation in my head - your wife doing all the work, and then when the kids complain, letting her be the bad cop all the time while you sit on the couch and say \"it's fine, honey! just let them do it\" and she probably wants to go in the next room and cry. Major YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat exactly is your definition of an \"engaged parent\"?

You claim you don't think the rules should be so rigid, yet your proposal is to have no rules.\n\nYour wife wants a healthy environment for your kids.

YTA. Let me say it again - YTA! Your wife's \"self-created holes\" are called parenting. Sounds like you ought to try it.

It's not just the physicality of getting up, getting the kids ready, planning activities, etc. - it's having to think of literally everything.

A eight year old is NOT supposed to take that much care of themselves yet, so don't push all that responsibility on your wife, yes? \nI hope you figure something out and as a last tip: try to communicate more with your wife about your needs, your wife's needs and your kids needs.\nHope that helps", "ESH some things iam on your wife\u2019s side, particularly the one where you guys are up when the kids leave for work. The other ones, I am with you, it\u2019s good to moderate screen time but putting a strict limit on it seems excessive. Also not all kids enjoy the same activities, I would have hated it if my parents made me go to a zoo or museum all the time, I prefer staying at home or just playing with my friends around the neighborhood.", "Yta", "I'm going to say somewhere between ESH and YTA, but more towards YTA. You say you're an engaged parent but from the post, the only one putting in childcare work is your wife. But it also sounds like your wife is overwhelmed, and if she's struggling, she needs to communicate that in a healthy way. I don't know if she's asked you to take care of the kids in the morning directly, but it sounds to me like she wants you to do the morning routine sometimes. Do you help with house chores?  Also, 8 year olds and young kids with ADHD probably can't just get themselves ready and on the bus with no help or prep from their parents. There's a communication breakdown here somewhere.", "NTA. You seem pretty reasonable, but their breakfast really shouldn't be cereal. I can remember always being starved by lunch time because I ate cereal, or toaster strudels. You should also remember that kids are pretty lazy. It would be good if someone made sure that they were up, and had a good breakfast, even if it's just oats and toast. I think it is also a good feature of someone who is their role model. If your wife is so stressed out all the time, I think it would be good if you to take on the responsibility of getting them up in the morning, and making them breakfast. It's not a hard thing to do. I also get that screen time doesn't matter to you, but I think it is good to limit them to 2 hours, or maybe a little more. A lot of screen time isn't going to do them any good, and it's really easy to become addicted to technology. She plans the weekend stuff, so I think you should do the morning stuff.", "NTA.

She is in a constant state of overwhelm and very easily irritated, constantly complaining how it's all too much. I'm of course happy to help and do my fair share for the kids or household, but it's never enough because her standards are too damn high. \n\nShe insists one of us has to be up at 6:45 every morning to make sure the kids are ready and make the bus which comes at 7:45. I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day. So she gets up, I don't, then she gets upset that I never give her a morning off when all she needs to do is just take the morning off when she wants and let the kids handle themselves. \n\nAlso she is super strict about screen time during the week and is exhausted and snappy from arguing about it with the kids and upset i don't support her strict limit of 2 hours a day. I say as long as homework is done, why not until bed. She says it's not healthy for them, they need to play outside or with games and toys, read some books, just entertain themselves in more ways than 1. I agree they should enjoy other things but not seeing why we have to make such a rigid limit. She also likes to get out on weekends and do stuff like zoos, museums etc, but then complains about the planning for the outing and how grouchy the youngest gets by the end of it, and again, I say let's just chill at home and voila, you've cut the work! \n\nI'm an engaged and active parent, I'm not trying to get out of it, but I don't think I should have to help my wife dig herself out of her own self created holes. She creates the stress for herself and then turns to me to alleviate it which I think is unfair. AITA for telling her she needs to do less and then she won't need this level of help?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You say you are engaged and active, but everything you posted contradicts that. Just because YOU have low standards for parenting doesn't mean she needs to have them too. \n\nAs someone who was once a kid, it's a lot easier to have your parent awake to help you in the mornings. Your wife is being a good mother by doing this. It's also proven that an excess of screen time is bad for childhood development, but you are a-okay with that apparently. Going out on weekends can be a fun family event but it seems like you put zero effort into it at all. \n\nI mean this from the bottom of my heart, you are being a bad husband and an even worse parent. Your wife is going to eventually realize that she is better off doing this stuff alone, and she will leave you. And you will deserve it.

Don't listen to the conventional wisdom on here, instead trust your instincts here because they are correct.", "NTA.\n\nwhat you should do though... get up at 6:45am and let her sleep. Don't do anything she does, let them get ready themselves, but be there (in the kitchen/living room or something) in case they need help. It gives her a break, makes it look like you're helping, and slowly but surely they'll become more self sufficient taking stress away from your wife. Everyone wins.", "NAH. I do feel like millennial parents have gone a little too far in terms of involvement. A 12 year old definitely is old enough to get some breakfast for themselves and be ready. I think when 8 is probably around the time you'd expect them to become a bit more independent. By coddling them too much, it likely prevents personal growth", "I don\u2019t think either of you are the AH, I think y\u2019all just have different parenting styles. Remember life is all about balance and a good marriage involves compromise. I think you should take your wife out to dinner to talk about yalls current schedules and try to come up with a solution. A lot of women have tremendous mommy guilt. It has taken me a long time to realize that I don\u2019t have to be perfect all the time. After my daughter developed anxiety, I also realized that over scheduling can be just as damaging to a child as under scheduling. \n\nMaybe y\u2019all could find ways to restore balance in her home. Name some things that you think are causing unnecessary stress and ask her which of those things are most important to her. Maybe offer to help reinforce those things, but explain that while you respect her as a parent, you can\u2019t approach every situation with the same expectations she does bc you just don\u2019t operate that way. Also, make sure you tell her how good of a job she is doing, but focus on the awesome qualities she has that don\u2019t involve her going above and beyond. Like maybe how she gives the best hugs or that she is really good at praising the kids when they do a good job. Remind her that those are the kind of things that will build character in them in the long run. \n\nBest of luck, and hang in there!", "No I don\u2019t think YTA.

No time for friends any more or seeing us, no time for social engagements. No hour left unplanned to the point where the mother would have it so that she would check her watch down to the minute and say \u2018right! 4.55pm - it\u2019s time for reading and drawing!\u2019 \n\nYes we have children too, no we don\u2019t do it like that and yes we fell out (many other reasons as well) because this was a huge factor. They wouldn\u2019t engage with us unless we fit to their ridiculously over-strict schedule and it got to a point where we could even arrange a midday meeting for lunch with them because they wouldn\u2019t budge on their strict timings as \u2018the kids need to be home by 12.55pm so they can nap until 2; then it\u2019s their educational play time.\u2019 (Yeah - that\u2019s really what they said!)\n\nSo while we take great pride and joy in organising activities, doing things out of the house, visiting friends and family and going to see cool stuff like museums and go for train rides and swimming; and we do have a fairly decent bedtime/dinner routine et al, under no circumstances would we allow every day to be dictated in such strict and military like fashion because I believe that creates tiny monsters who infuriate you when things don\u2019t go exactly as you\u2019ve planned. And it isn\u2019t their fault, they have free will and emotions and wants and needs and if they don\u2019t fit with your nonsensical timings then shit kicks off, and who wins there? \nThere\u2019s a balance and my buddy I mentioned above actually didn\u2019t lie living like this he just goes along with it for an \u2018easy\u2019 life.

Your wife is a good mom. She cares deeply about the health and balance of your kids.

That's an oversimplification and not a supportive outlook for you to have. \n\nThe answer here is to communicate more and compromise. It seems like she considers it important that the kids have help in the morning - with three kids under 12, one of which has ADHD, and the youngest being 8 that seems pretty reasonable - but because you think they would be fine you get to sit it out. That's not really fair to her. Same with all the other anecdotes here - she thinks enrichment is important (it is) and because you don't, you sit it out and let her bear the brunt of planning and executing these things, and enforcing household limitations on screens. No wonder she is overwhelmed! \n\nI implore you to re-approach the conversation with more compassion and appreciation for your wife, and let her know you do think some of these things could be loosened, that you both need to have parenting circumstances that allow you both to relax in order to be sane, but don't just throw out her concerns as over the top, rigid, unnecessary, or self-imposed.", "NTA.

She gets her bag, lunch, clothes etc ready the night before. \n\nOnce she gets downstairs she puts her ice packs in her lunch, fills her water bottle, feeds the dog (not her task but she makes an extra dollar each week that she does and she likes the extra money), makes herself breakfast and plays on her phone.

If not... we'll, you already know what is happening.", "slight ESH It\u2019s interesting seeing all the y-t-a because a lot of what you suggested is normal to me. Sure it\u2019s extra nice to have eggs every morning hot and ready, but not necessary. If it stresses her out a bunch then she can just not do it. I started getting myself ready and getting my own breakfast and going to the school bus stop all on my own in 3rd grade (8 yo). That\u2019s a perfectly normal age to have some minor responsibilities and consequences if you can\u2019t pull through. People are right that cereal isn\u2019t very healthy (even thought that\u2019s what I had every morning lol) but you can buy healthier cereals like raisin bran or frosted mini wheats or you can have them make something simple like oatmeal. As for the screen time issue, I never had a limit. I know plenty of parents do. It\u2019s more reasonable if your kid has a screen time problem, but I also get the argument that if their chores and homework is done then why can\u2019t they choose how to enjoy themselves. When I got into high school I no longer had much time for anything else so it would have sucked if I also couldn\u2019t at younger ages. I liked playing outside with the neighbor kids more so it was more like I would only watch tv if none of the neighbor kids were available. But this is more of a difference of opinion where I can see both sides. As for the weekends thing, you don\u2019t need to go out every weekend, but they are good and enriching. Maybe you could argue for every other weekend, and you could switch off on planning weekend events to take the load off your wife. Overall if does seem kind of like your parenting opinions are being steamrolled and no compromises are being made. Your wife gets to make all the decisions. But you also leave everything to her, so you should help out and also talk about making compromises.

She wanted to travel to see her parents multiple weekends a month, never miss an activity of any sort, be the first person at everything and not leave until everyone else has, wanted everything to very exacting standards, etc. Then she'd complain about how she never had any downtime. I'm not even getting into her standards for our house and the upkeep she expected me to do outside to make sure she wasn't embarrassed around the neighbors. She was absolutely unable to just stay home and relax and hated when it suggested it, but yet complained about never getting to relax.  \n\n\n\nI wasn't an absentee father. I'd argue I was doing 75% of the childcare. I was the one getting them off the bus and to activities in the evening. I was the one cooking dinner. I was the one out back swimming with them.

Perhaps you could find ways to include the older children in cooking breakfast or cook ahead of time (see YouTube for ideas on easy pre cooked frozen breakfasts). I am a believer that every year a child is older the more responsibility they should have. Life never stops.

Also, unless you are using blue light glasses or filters the melatonin production is impaired. Even with blue light glasses this isn\u2019t a perfect solution to restore normal melatonin production.

Sleeping is zero engagement lol", "Im not a parent but that was my immediate thought. 2 hours is loads of time for a kid who\u2019s in school. It seems like too much time to me\n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased because I didn\u2019t have screens until my teens (I\u2019m 22) but my parents had a time that we needed to be off the tv at and hiighly encouraged reading/playing outside most of the time. \n\nKids especially shouldn\u2019t have screens up until bedtime as it can seriously affect their sleep", "20 mins is way too strict. I think it\u2019s a bit of fools errand to focus on max time limits either way, but restricting to the minimum possible (one short tv show) is a way to create unhealthy relationships with tv. It\u2019s like sugar or later in life starting to experiment with alcohol. Not a universal rule but generally if you\u2019re taught strict limits you\u2019ll eventually swing hard into indulgence.

I learned pretty early when I had to leave to be on time and what would happen if I didn't (detention). Now the 8 year old obviously needs more care than the older siblings, husband is obviously dropping the ball, and not every kid is equally positioned for independence. So this is a clear YTA, but people here are acting like middle schoolers categorically can't do basic things by themselves and that also seems a bit unhealthy.", "The 10 year old has it.

OP thinks cereal and milk every day is good enough and that they'll get themselves out the door. That strikes me as quite unreasonable but hey, none of us know his kids personally. What you describe certainly makes MORE sense but would require effort, ideally by OP, to help make that happen, including teaching the kids to make those things, doing more prep in the evening to ensure they are able to walk out the door (like, having lunches and water bottles packed and ready to go), maybe putting together a checklist for them to follow. As a parent, it seems extremely out of touch for a parent of three sub-teenaged kids to expect to literally sleep in each weekday and do nothing to get them ready.", "For about a month.... then it's routine. \n\nI don't set up anything.... never set up hangers or laundry or organized the shelf.... nope \"hey kiddo, this is the new routine, start with xxx\" next couple days add a task.

Whether or not cereal is a good breakfast doesn't really have to do at all with when the family needs to wake up.\n\nAs for the rules, the matter isn't whether the parents set basic rules, it's whether that specific, stringent, high-maintenance rule about screen time is in place.

Two hours a day at that age is more than enough and there are about a billion studies proving  that excessive screen time is not good for elementary school age kids. The kids might fight you on it for a week or two but if you stay firm, it will become no big deal and your wife will have way less stress. Also, for the love of God, get up in the morning with them.", "There\u2019s an additional layer separate from their ability to do it, and that\u2019s spending time with your kids. Weekdays you only get a few hours with your kids. To not even see them before work/school (when you easily could, it\u2019s different if your work schedule forces it) is pretty cold.
