He didn't understand why I was upset because he was there too and when I said I was getting a motel for a few days (said out of anger but still said)  he then said he would leave instead and has his bag packed and ready to go but I'm regretting everything I said and begged for another chance but he is set on leaving because apparently there is not coming back from this. \n\nPretty cut and dry im the bad guy I won't deny that but he has also pulled the im going to leave card many times before so I don't understand how me threatening to do it was the final straw.

He did not respect your boundaries and sense of safety! \n\nIssue 2: your reaction of threatening to leave before giving him a chance to explain.

And you're right, he wasn't. That's incredibly bizarre behavior from a GROWN man, and at 42, he's grown. I feel really sad that you experienced this, but even more so that you feel like it's your fault. He's spinning it on you so you'll grovel and feel bad and accept more bad behavior from him. I mean this in the kindest way possible because I want better for you; honestly if he left you, he'd be doing you a favor because he is endangering you.

I\u2019ve had the privilege of being homeless, I would never take a comment about a 40 year old man with 3 roommates dating a 20 year old being creepy as an attack on men, projecting.", "Literally what are you talking about. Incomprehensible gibberish.\n\nMe: \u201cyou are acting like a child by saying this stuff\u201d\n\nYou: \u201ceven if I was a child, I could still say what I\u2019m saying\u201d \n\n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f yes, you would act like how a child acts if you were a child. Incredible insight. Truly you are set to go to a T1. \n\n> I was homeless, I\u2019m not insulted \n\nWhat is the point you are trying and failing to make, exactly? You were homeless, comma, and so you wouldn\u2019t take that as an attack on men\u2026 what the hell does that have to do with anything i or you said. That doesn\u2019t relate to anything at all. \n\nWho cares if you were homeless? \n\nAnd why are you saying I took that as an attack on men? Are you trying to put words in my mouth? I can\u2019t even tell. You\u2019re not very good at expressing yourself. Perhaps T2 is more your fit \ud83d\ude02"]}
