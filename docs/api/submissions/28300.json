Can you work towards setting aside money to buy a second home (main or vacation)? If main then you could rent this one. Depends on your finances but yes this isn\u2019t a time to sell if you have a good interest rate.", "INFO: how do you split finances? What payments does she make towards the house? Where would the money from this remodel come from? Who makes the financial decisions in the home regarding utility suppliers etc? What is her financial situation like? Do you plan on having children in the future? Have the two of your discussed what your actual beliefs around marriage are and are you sure they both line up?\n\nIf money for the remodel of the house is coming from marital income, you're asking her to invest her money into something she doesn't own and will never have a stake in.\n\nMarriage certificate or not, she is essentially a tenant in your home. That is going to create an inevitable power and stability imbalance in your marriage. Not selling your home is a smart financial decision for you in the current climate, but it may not be the best decision for your relationship. \n\nIs there an option for her to buy her way onto the deed as a short term compromise until the economy is stable enough to look at selling up and buying one together? Is she in a strong enough financial position to get a small property to rent out until you can both your dream home together? \n\nI'm reluctant to offer an actual judgement on this one. You both have very valid points of view. I would just encourage each of you to consider the situation from each other's perspective. Imagine what it would be like to live in - and possibly consider eventually raising children in - a home that you have no chance of owning, and you probably never will get to own your own home. If you are considering children in your future, your wife could be looking at a few years' setback in her career, meaning she's sacrificing her potential earnings for the family. \n\nThe thing about building a life with another person is, you both need to figure out what personal sacrifices you're willing to make for the good of the marital unit. And I'm not saying that means you need to sell your home and get a new mortgage in a terrible economy, but I am saying you should really consider *all* your options, maybe with a financial advisor, and see what agreements you can both come to.", "I'm in a similar situation as your wife. But I'd never ask my wife to sell. Our neighborhood is good, payment low, and good equity, and let's us do the traveling and such that we enjoy, since our house payment is so cheap. NTA", "You'll probably double your mortgage  payments with interest rates being what they are.  Your offer to redecorate or remodel is more reasonable.\n\nNAH\n\nIt's understandable that she wants to live in a place where she's had some say in it.\n\nHowever, \"In *this* economy!\"", "NAH. I absolutely understand where your wife is coming from- I would not want to make a mutual home from something my partner chose by themselves, bought themselves, and I moved into. I\u2019m guessing her name isn\u2019t on the title as well, which might make her feel insecure about her own future. That being said, you\u2019re right that the housing market completely stinks right now.", "NTA. The housing market is pretty bad and it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to try to buy anything else. I think your remodeling suggestion is a good one", "NTA.  Why not invest in a vacation home together so that she can own a house.", "NTA - You would be crazy to sell right now.", "NAH - 30 years ago, my bestie moved into her husband's house that he had since his previous marriage. She has never been able to remodel in any fashion. It's HIS HOUSE. \n\nI totally get where your wife is coming from. It's not hers. It doesn't feel like hers.", "NTA\n\nYour post history indicates that you may have some financial struggles with your current expenses.  Frankly, you can't afford the higher interest rates of a mortgage today, not the costs of moving.\n\nAdditionally, your history indicates that your marriage may not be on the most stable footing right now.  And all marriages have those periods, so I'm not making any judgement.  However, if you sold a house in just your name that's a premarital asset and used the money from that sale to buy a house deeded in both your names, that would legally give your wife half of all your equity.  \n\nIf the two of you buy a house together, your wife needs to be prepared to pay half the down payment, half the mortgage, and half of all expenses.  If that's not what she's wanting, then don't sell your house.\n\nAnd reading between the lines, I'm concerned that your wife may be using your emotions to manipulate you.  Please consider getting some individual and/or couple's counseling.", "NAH. You both have valid concerns. How about offering to sell half of the house to her? If she doesn't have the cash, you could work with a lawyer to draw up a contract where she'd be paying 100% of the mortgage for as long as it takes for your stakes to be equal. And in case of divorce, she'd walk away with a stake commensurate with what she contributed up to that point.", "NTA.\n\nIf your wife can't articulate why she doesn't want to live there anymore other than with a bullshit reason, I would say hard \"no\". The housing market is terrible at the moment.", "Nta", " NTA.\nIt's being smart financially..", "She wants you to sell because if you get divorced she will have no claim to your current property. If you sell and buy a new house it will be considered a marital asset and she will own half", "OP, you do call it \"my house\" in the headline...is there anything that makes her feel that it isn't her home, too?", "NTA,\n\nIt'd be silly to sell in this current market. Bring home some wallpaper sample books or have them redecorate the living room. Unless they make a lot of money and want to buy a big house just to have a big house.", "NTA. Don\u2019t sell your house. You shouldn\u2019t even have moved her in there in the first place. You should have rented it out and bought something separate together that you could live in. Then it would have remained a pre-marital asset.", "Is the house in both of your names? \n\nDoes she like where the house is located? Is it the right size for both of you? Does she have her own space? If you\u2019re planning on children is it in. Good school district? Is it close to her friends? Your friends? Both of your friends? Your ex\u2019s friends? Have you ever lived with an ex there? \n\nI\u2019m not making a judgement right now, until more info  but as someone who\u2019s lived in a house I\u2019ve *hated* for 18 years, I\u2019m sympathetic with your wife.  I don\u2019t necessarily think this is a good time to sell unless you\u2019ll have enough equity to buy a new house without a mortgage because  of interest rates. Otherwise, I do think after five years of marriage, if she still doesn\u2019t like this house that you really shouldn\u2019t get to make a unilateral decision to keep the house because you like it or want it as your nest egg. Save up and get a second house (when interest rates are better). Pay off this house and buy one you both like or buy when interest rates are better. \n\nBut I do think houses are a two yes, one no in the long run. There is literally nothing that could be done to make me love my house. I appreciate I *have* a house. But I hate it. I get more bitter every year. I know I\u2019m here forever. I tried really hard to love it and to think of things I could do to make me like it better. It is hard to maintain positivity if you live in a place (town, country, city) or a space (house) you dislike, loathe, or hate. It just wears on you.", "NTA.  There is no way I would be voluntarily entering the housing market right now if I already had a perfectly good house.", "After five years, she still doesn't feel like it's her house? I think she just wants to be on the deed, and I wonder why. NTA.", "NTA- Not with the current market as it is for sure and, even if it wasnt this bad, you still wouldn't be the NTA (as long as that wouldn't affect your ability to pay your half of the new place).", "NTSA.. shes being dumb.. i know someone that did that and a few months later, they had to get a roommate to help out because that woman is a SAHM", "Under 1K a month with taxes and insurance is ridiculously cheap nowadays. You\u2019re NTA, and frankly, she\u2019s being a bit unreasonable.", "NTA. She\u2019s being unrealistic about a solvable problem. You\u2019ve offered a reasonable solution. Her plan would harm you financially in a significant way.", "NAH \n\nboth understandable points of view, try to talk to your wife and find a compromise that works for her - if she doesn't already then suggest that she takes joint ownership of the house. If its in your budget then you could also consider some remodelling or changes to the floor plan of the house.", "NTA\n\nI have a separate home from my boyfriend, when we marry, I will keep my home and he will keep his, one of us will use our non-lived-in property as a rental.  If we ever decide to sell, we will sell both and purchase together, but never in a housing market like exists today.  \n\nRemodeling is a good option.", "NTA. Sounds like she wants a financial stake in case the marriage doesn't work out. That's kind of a reasonable ask from her point of view, but still a poor financial decision to sell.", "Oh lord. Financially that is a horrible idea.  \nQuestion: did you live in the house with another wife/partner at any time? Have you let your wife have free reign over decorating the house so she is reflected in the house? \nBut lord selling and rebuying right now is a horrible idea.", "NTA", "Nah.", "Shes emotional about a business decision NTA", "Agreed!", "What a lame excuse.", "NAH.  This should have been addressed at the time you got married.  However, both of you have legitimate points, but with prices and interest rates, it is better to stay there.", "NAH although the market shouldn't matter too much, but if it's a strong buyer's market it might take a long time to sell so conditional offers you make might fall through. Ie. If you buy and sell comparable properties that should be similar prices it's the realtor's fees, lawyer's fees, etc. that add up.\n\nHave you made specific suggestions that would make the house feel like hers? For example, she could pick out paint colours.", "NTA methinks she wants to be able to get 50% of the house If she divorced you. Right now she can't since you bought the house and paid it off before she came into the picture. Once you buy. New house, 50% of it goes to her in a divorce.", "NAH. If you have the money, you rent your house, buy a new one, and move to it. Then your wife gets the house she wants, you get to keep your nest egg home, and your rent will allow you to pay your mortgage AND offset the increased payments of the new mortgage. You do this until rates fall, then refinance. In the long term it\u2019s a wash.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t have to sell to move.

For 5 years and historically low interest rates up until last year she has lived in the house you own and she has not been able to build equity or choose a house she might like to live in.

Although honestly I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019d be willing to move even if the market was better. \n\nIs her concern that she isn\u2019t part owner?\n\nYou could also make a definitive timeline regarding buying: Say interest rates don\u2019t improve, and pricing doesn\u2019t come down you agree to move in 1 year regardless. Rent it out if you want to keep it. \n \nMaybe you need to more proactively encourage changes. My husband would always say decorate or do what you want when I moved in and he truly meant it.

And talk to her first to see if this would even help because if after 5 years she doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s home, she may never. \n\nNTA but I think ultimately Moving into something together and renting or selling it is the fairest option.

I think that if you're married to someone, you should have rights to the home you're living in. If you think of a house as your own hard work, then why even get married and open up your life to another person?", "If she has contributed in the past 5 years, she likely has a stake in equity at least.

I did not have interest by \u201cdefault\u201d because we were married. If he had only used rental income for maintenance, then I would\u2019ve had no claim to it. I only pulled that card to prove a point when my step-MIL got in his ear and he started getting greedy about assets. I think she was pissed when she found out I owned the majority stake in the home we bought together. I paid the down payment with money I saved up before we got married. Suddenly, he was trying to nitpick the value of my car (I had to commute 50mi/day while he worked from home) and my stock investments. I went back to the month before we got married and did FIFO accounting for *everything.*\n\nOften, what you owned before marriage remains yours.", "Premarital asset.....", "Why not?", "It's worse than that trust me. She just became a licensed realtor and has never owned a house.", "So redecorate.", "But op already offered to make any changes she likes", "Exactly. It's not the stupid decorations. Redecorating doesn't erase the fact that my husband made a home here already with someone else. They made a home together, and it's always gonna feel off to me. Like I'm intruding on what they built together and all that goes with that.", "My point was that I am 100% positive that this is a conversation they have had multiple times over the past 5 years. Mortgages are higher now but up until 3.5 years ago they were at historic lows. \n\nIt might not make financial sense now but it would 100% have made financial sense a year and a half ago if they were to buy a new house. \n\nOP, think long and hard about what it is that you want here because there is a BIG difference between something making financial sense for you personally and something making financial and emotional sense for you two as a couple.

She gets to spend years as her husband's tenant.", "As i said, selling is not the only option. If she can't bear being in this house, then they both can rent a new place and rent this house out.

They never married but the courts saw her as common law even though he basically stopped even going there, stayed at his parents.  Was too passive to get the paperwork together to legally evict her.\nShe claimed.common law because she lived there, moved everything in but was in his name.

I've even tried to explain to her how much real estate she's going to need to sell as an agent in order to have that kind of income. She's been in the country for 20 years but just hasn't had much real world experience. It's a work in progress and thankfully I have a lot of patience to spare because she is a very good woman and mother.", "You literally are, though, lol.", "She wants to pay 1% towards a new house and get 50% of the equity. Lol.\n\n\nShe can save the money that she gets for living for free in his house so in case they divorce she can buy her own house.", "I saw it happen, I wss around this person for 12 years.\nAnd then studied law in my 20s.  \nSo, yeah, it can happen and it did.  \nYou also don't know our system here so unless you do, you cant really tell me that anything does or doesn't add up.\n\n1\n Eviction is extremely difficult to do here, tenants or squatters have the upper hand.  It is very normal for this process to take years.  Currently know people in my jib who have tenants that havwnt paid a dime in rent in 18 mo ths and although he's filed, he can't do a thing until it's approved to go through and only then can the cops attend and forcibly remove them.  Not even the condo board has been able to get them out and they've destroyed the unit, cops are there daily, it's pretty bad.  Feel so bad for him, it was his retirement investment.\n\n2. Common law is a real thing here and often times treated as a marriage.  If she can prove she lived in this apartment, which she could as she fully.moved in, and coukd show that the apartment was in his name, they wss enough to submit paperwork to go after his assets.  His family owned companies, which is why he was likely targeted for this.  For reference, the toronto vreal estate market is one of the most expensive in the world.  So she got a multimillion dollar property for zero.  Just had to sleep with the guy once and squat in his apartment.\nShe also got his Porche Boxter too.  \nNever married.  Not even dating.  When my grandma left that particular building, the ONS was still there and Tony was always complaining to my mum on the phone that he was scared to buy another place in case she went after that too.  He had to actually get a legal agreement from her that was similar to a divorce but not technically, to say she was done going after him so he could finally buy a place to move to without fear of her petitioning for more money.\n\nThe laat I heard from him was maybe about 8 years ago amd he was still paying alimony to her.  This whole debacle happened originally in 1996."]}
