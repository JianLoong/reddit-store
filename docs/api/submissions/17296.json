My mom is big on doing themed birthdays and we literally rented a tiny castle in my town. She also made me a huge purple sparkles and tulle dress to wear that day. It's not an odyssey to sewing because at the time she barely knew how to sew so it's very easily broken but it's everything a 9-year-old girl could want. I treasure the dress and the birthday party as great memories. I loved dressing up as a kid and had a lot of costumes, I gifted most of them except for this one.\n\nMy parents are divorced and I live with my mom. I don't really have a great relationship with my dad's new girlfriend and family. I've felt many times like they don't respect any boundaries or personal space I might need to adjust.\n\nI have a brother who is 9, he lives in both houses and has a great relationship with my step-sister, 8.  Sometimes when he is at moms house she comes here because she gets invited with the rest of my brother's friends. The dress is in his costume rack and I don't mind his friends putting it on to play while they are in the house, because I like that it's used and that it creates the same joy as it once gave me. My stepsister loves using this dress.\n\nYesterday was my step sisters birthday, my dad called me in the morning and told me she had just decided she wanted instead a costume party, so he was wondering if I could lend her my purple dress.\n\nI told him I didn't feel comfortable lending it to her for her birthday because 1) the party would be outside and it's a long dress that could get ruined and he or his girlfriend isn't well known for taking care of other people's stuff. (I didn't say that to him) and 2) honestly it's my birthday dress, I don't mind other girls using it for playing at my house for an hour or two but if she also uses it for her birthday then it stops being my birthday dress, it's just a dress used for birthdays. This might be a little selfish but it's the truth.\n\nHe was shocked? I refused and told me he already told everyone to wear a costume and the birthday girl couldn't be the only one without a costume, I told him to use another costume or rent one, but he said she didn't have costumes and ones for rent are ugly. I stood my ground and so did he, he eventually showed up at my house trying to convince me in person and my mom put a stop to it, she told him he couldn't make choices so last minute and expect everyone to agree with him, they got to an agreement where in the next birthday she would make my stepsister a new dress for herself and he ended up renting another dress. But even after that, he sent me a text telling me he is disappointed in me because he raised me to be able to share. I feel bad for her but I don't feel like it's my responsibility to save her poor planed birthday.

I dont even think its selfish. You are gracious enough to allow kids to use and play in the dress which is obviously important to you when they are in an environment you feel comfortable doing so. You do not even have to do this and you definitely do not have to allow further concessions. It isnt just some dress you once wore that no longer fits or has purpose for you. Its sentimental. Your dad should have respected your answer.", "NTA. You do share. Kid's come over and you let them play with it under your supervision. Lending out to a children's birthday party isn't 'sharing'. And how did everyone else manage to get a costume but he didn't think to ask you ahead of time?", "nta. It's very nice of you to let her play with it at all. If you are interested in ever having kids it would be a nice keepsake to pass down.", "Nta and if I were you I would stop letting the dress be used for play as it could get ruined just as easily in that situation.", "NTA.
