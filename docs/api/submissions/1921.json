I get around 120 dollars a month. I have allergies and can not eat school food, so this money is for me to buy food to eat at school.\n\nMy close friend (15F), Amy, is the complete opposite. She comes from a single mother who is not wealthy. She and I have stopped being friends multiple times as sometimes it feels like she only likes me for my money. She'll say she has no money and she'll pay me back. From this school year alone, she owes me 94 dollars already. We met when I was 9 and she was 10.\n\nAs I've mentioned before, I'm from Miami. Youth Fair opens in March and Santa's Enchanted Forest today.\n\nI have another best friend, (16F), Abigail. Our families were already friends. She comes from a middle-class family. She's always paid me back. Our families go to the parks every year together. This year is our last year at the same school, however. As I will be attending a boarding school in a different state next school year. This will be our last year going to the amusement parks together, so we both bought the seasonal passes as well as the express passes.\n\nSeasonal passes let you in as many times as you want. Express is just to skip the long lines.\n\nAmy is aware that it is my last year and is aware that Abigail and I always go to the parks. Abigail's parents arent strict and neither are mine so we are going alone whenever we want. Amy's mom is very strict and would have to come with us. No problem. We can go once with her and just go just us the rest of the time. Amy asked if she could come this year to \"make memories\" and I said it was fine. No, she was not originally invited.\n\nUntil she started asking when I'm going to buy the tickets for her and her mother. I told her I thought she would pay but that it was fine and I would pay for both of them. I had to ask my father for extra pocket money as I ran out of the 100 for the month already when I bought a birthday present for Abigail. Both tickets would be 90 dollars. I was planning on buying them Single passes, which is just to go for one day. I sent Amy a screenshot of me buying the tickets and asked if that day was good for her. She called me cheap. It would cost me 150 $ to buy her what me and my friend have. I told her that if she was going to be rude about it I could just not go with her and that buying her mom a ticket was good enough already. She said I could buy the single tickets, ONLY IF I pay for her with all the games and food.\n\nNow see, I did that last year. My whole group, around 6 of us, went to the Youth Fair. Everybody, EXCEPT AMY, paid for themselves. She insisted I pay for all her food and games and for merch, which I did.\n\nI told her no, and that I was no longer inviting her. She kept calling me and when I picked up, she yelled cuss words at me and said I'm a horrible friend. She believes I'm being TA but Abigail believes I just stood up for myself.\n\nWIBTA if I didn't pay for my friend at an amusement park.\n\nEdit: I don't want to go into too much details but the monthly allowance I get covers school activities, snacks, clothes, etc etc. I try to not go over it and usually save a lot of the money!

Single mother, modest income, occasionally mum wasn\u2019t sure where money for this or that would come from but we made it work. \n\nYou sound like a very considerate young person and conscientious of your privilege. You have tried very hard to include your friend, and I\u2019m sorry that she has taken extreme liberties with your generosity over the years.\n\nDoes Amy\u2019s mother know that you were paying for her ticket, and what the tickets cost? I\u2019m old enough to be your friend\u2019s mother and frankly I am astonished that, if she knows a teenager is being pressured to pay for her and how much, she is not more ashamed of herself. \n\nI\u2019d suggest moving forward if you wish to stay friends with Amy, make it clear you will not be paying for her outings any longer but do hang out at free events and bring packed lunches, meet up at libraries, grab a $4 coffee together. It sounds to me like this friendship has run its course however, I don\u2019t know that Amy is ever going to get that chip off her shoulder and either accept or get herself out of her low income bracket as she grows up if her solution is that everyone else should pay for her.", "Wow i wouldnt even have bought the mother a ticket.

Just cut her off already", "NTA. You offered to buy her and her mom tickets with money you needed to ask your dad for. That was a nice gesture, and would have allowed them to participate. She has zero right to call you cheap or demand more as if she\u2019s owed something from you. \n\nWealth disparities can be hard, but they don\u2019t give anyone permission to be an entitled AH, which is exactly how she was acting.", "NTA she has no right to expect you to pay for anything for her, never mind her mother, especially when she invited herself. Cut her off.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not just about the upgrade from $45 to $150 for the annual pass. Then she'd need to have mom have the annual pass too. Then she'd need the fast pass upgrades. Then she'd need spending money in the park. She's not your (or, indirectly, your parents) financial responsibility.", "NTA, on what planet should a teenager be paying for a friend\u2019s parent to attend a theme park. \n\nYou are 15 and it\u2019s extremely generous of you to pay for your friend, but being asked to pay for her Mommy is ridiculous!

You should stop giving her your money and paying for things for her. You should spend your money on you. You can buy gift for friends when appropriate (holidays, birthdays, special occasions).

Girl, you're not rich. You're a kid. Your parents have discretion over how they use their money, including giving you some.

I have This month I got 120 to pay for food (which I cannot eat school food because of many many allergies + I'm lactose intolerant) I don't spend all 120 in a month obviously. I'll only spend a max of 60 a month on stuff I need (clothing, food, etc). It is my parent's way of trying to teach me how to finance my money. I didn't mean to show off, which I'm sorry if I did, but I was trying to show the difference in what me and Amy come from", "Thank you! I have decided to lessen my contact with Amy. I would have felt bad asking my father for more money anyways because this is the first time in around 7 months that I've gone over my allowance in a month", "Hmmm, if Amy\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t know then I\u2019m not sure how I feel about you telling her. I personally would let it go unless Amy\u2019s mother confronts you or your parents about the rescinded invitation. If so, all I would say is \u201cI offered to pay for a ticket for Amy and Amy\u2019s mother, but I could not afford to pay for season passes. Amy believed this meant that I should pay for all her food and games, as I had done last year, but this year I am not able to afford to pay her way AND buy her mother\u2019s ticket as Amy has asked me to.\u201d \n\nIf Amy\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t like theme parks and otherwise would not have gone, then your friend has been manipulative with everyone around her to get what SHE wants and is unlikely to change. \n\nI would cut ties with Amy. Be prepared, Amy might lie to her mother and say they\u2019re not going now because you were a horrible b**** who promised the tickets then gave them to someone else. When dealing with a manipulative person, you will always be the worst person in the world to them when they don\u2019t get their way. The only thing you can do is maintain your boundaries, act graciously, and you will know that you\u2019re not the horrible monster they are saying you are. You\u2019ll find that when you know this about yourself, it doesn\u2019t matter what petty lies people spread about you, and what people you don\u2019t think about might think about you.\n\nP.S. Yes, we are doing very well now. My mother and I both worked hard to educate ourselves in financial literacy and I developed my skills in my area of expertise so now I work a low six figure job that earns enough for my own child and my partner and I to live comfortably. Amy has the chance to do this for herself if she really wants to, but she will have to accept her situation and propel herself forward to achieve it.", "My point is that she shouldn\u2019t accept it from you, even if you offered.", "Beware of people who pressure you to do things in order to fix their feelings. It's an emotional manipulation tactic, that easily slides into abuse. Listen to your gut. When you feel uncomfortable in a situation, it's likely there's a boundary needed to protect your safety, privacy, or comfort. Being pressured to give more feels bad because your boundaries of comfort with your finances and your feelings are being violated. You offered what you were comfortable giving. Demanding more violated that boundary. \"That's all I can offer. Sorry that's not enough for you.\" would be maintaining that boundary.\n\nYou want your friendships to be positive, supportive, and right-sized for you. None of you are adults, with the resources, authority or responsibilities of adults. You should be equals, kids dependent on your parents for access to resources. Her putting you in the position of \"making up for\" the disparity between your parents and hers is pushing you into a parent/provider role that is wholly inappropriate. Her making you responsible for her jealousy and greed is also pushing you into an impossible role- being responsible to fix her feelings by doing the thing you are not comfortable consenting to.\n\nThese things are complicated, confusing and upsetting when they happen. Try to start paying attn to your feelings of discomfort and looking for what in this situation feels wrong to you. It's always okay to withdraw your consent and participation in situations that seemed okay and desirable, but have now taken an uncomfortable turn. It's okay to decide to no longer do something you've done before, but now don't want to do."]}
