I get around 120 dollars a month. I have allergies and can not eat school food, so this money is for me to buy food to eat at school.\n\nMy close friend (15F), Amy, is the complete opposite. She comes from a single mother who is not wealthy. She and I have stopped being friends multiple times as sometimes it feels like she only likes me for my money. She'll say she has no money and she'll pay me back. From this school year alone, she owes me 94 dollars already. We met when I was 9 and she was 10.\n\nAs I've mentioned before, I'm from Miami. Youth Fair opens in March and Santa's Enchanted Forest today.\n\nI have another best friend, (16F), Abigail. Our families were already friends. She comes from a middle-class family. She's always paid me back. Our families go to the parks every year together. This year is our last year at the same school, however. As I will be attending a boarding school in a different state next school year. This will be our last year going to the amusement parks together, so we both bought the seasonal passes as well as the express passes.\n\nSeasonal passes let you in as many times as you want. Express is just to skip the long lines.\n\nAmy is aware that it is my last year and is aware that Abigail and I always go to the parks. Abigail's parents arent strict and neither are mine so we are going alone whenever we want. Amy's mom is very strict and would have to come with us. No problem. We can go once with her and just go just us the rest of the time. Amy asked if she could come this year to \"make memories\" and I said it was fine. No, she was not originally invited.\n\nUntil she started asking when I'm going to buy the tickets for her and her mother. I told her I thought she would pay but that it was fine and I would pay for both of them. I had to ask my father for extra pocket money as I ran out of the 100 for the month already when I bought a birthday present for Abigail. Both tickets would be 90 dollars. I was planning on buying them Single passes, which is just to go for one day. I sent Amy a screenshot of me buying the tickets and asked if that day was good for her. She called me cheap. It would cost me 150 $ to buy her what me and my friend have. I told her that if she was going to be rude about it I could just not go with her and that buying her mom a ticket was good enough already. She said I could buy the single tickets, ONLY IF I pay for her with all the games and food.\n\nNow see, I did that last year. My whole group, around 6 of us, went to the Youth Fair. Everybody, EXCEPT AMY, paid for themselves. She insisted I pay for all her food and games and for merch, which I did.\n\nI told her no, and that I was no longer inviting her. She kept calling me and when I picked up, she yelled cuss words at me and said I'm a horrible friend. She believes I'm being TA but Abigail believes I just stood up for myself.\n\nWIBTA if I didn't pay for my friend at an amusement park.\n\nEdit: I don't want to go into too much details but the monthly allowance I get covers school activities, snacks, clothes, etc etc. I try to not go over it and usually save a lot of the money!

It's an emotional manipulation tactic, that easily slides into abuse. Listen to your gut. When you feel uncomfortable in a situation, it's likely there's a boundary needed to protect your safety, privacy, or comfort. Being pressured to give more feels bad because your boundaries of comfort with your finances and your feelings are being violated. You offered what you were comfortable giving. Demanding more violated that boundary. \"That's all I can offer. Sorry that's not enough for you.\" would be maintaining that boundary.\n\nYou want your friendships to be positive, supportive, and right-sized for you. None of you are adults, with the resources, authority or responsibilities of adults. You should be equals, kids dependent on your parents for access to resources. Her putting you in the position of \"making up for\" the disparity between your parents and hers is pushing you into a parent/provider role that is wholly inappropriate. Her making you responsible for her jealousy and greed is also pushing you into an impossible role- being responsible to fix her feelings by doing the thing you are not comfortable consenting to.\n\nThese things are complicated, confusing and upsetting when they happen. Try to start paying attn to your feelings of discomfort and looking for what in this situation feels wrong to you. It's always okay to withdraw your consent and participation in situations that seemed okay and desirable, but have now taken an uncomfortable turn. It's okay to decide to no longer do something you've done before, but now don't want to do.", "NTA. Why exactly does Amy think you, her teenage friend, are obligated to buy her things all the time?! She is not your child. You are not her parent. You're also a kid. If and when you CHOOSE to pay for her so you can enjoy time with her, that is a GIFT.

I'm talking no electricity needing an ice chest to keep medicine cold. \n\nI never expected nor demanded any of my friends to do anything for me.\n\nNever expected them to buy me stuff,  buy me ticket,  or go on cruises with me or go on trips with me, not any of it. \n\n I had rich friends. I'm talking multiple cars, big house, summer vacations, fancy dresses etc...

My problems, weren't their problems. \n\n Eventually as our friendship grew and their trust in me grew they started buying me things here and there.

I never asked for them to help, never expected them to pay etc.... \n\n There's a movie I want you to watch it's called princess and the frog.

My friends were usually less fortunate than us, and my mom was everyone\u2019s mom. She was the mom who all my friends loved. She was young, fun, took us to do things. But I remember my mom got me an expensive lap top for my 13th birthday because I liked to write, and during my birthday party my friends shut themselves in my room with my laptop and ignored me. This happened every time they came over. Eventually my mom quit allowing them over because they did the same thing when we got the new PlayStation, in high school I had similar friends. My mom and I got Starbucks every morning before school as a treat. Especially since I loved hot chocolate or hot tea and I had chorus first period so hot tea was great for my throat.

OPs parents giving them money does, in fact make her money. \n\n\nOP, NTA don't listen to this person and stop talking to that \"friend\"", "NTA, Amy is a user and she is just gas-lighting you because you finally set some boundaries and stood up to her.  She will only get worse....you did good.", "NTA, you are not her friend but a cash point", "Why do you think Amy is your friend? Nothing in your post makes me think she sees you as anything but an ATM. \n\nMy advice, drop her like a hot rock. And go NC on all your devices. You won't regret it.\n\nYou are not the asshole! But she is, a big user AH!", "NTA. Normal, well adjusted people do not act like that. I would ghost that \"friend\" as soon as possible.", "NTA. She still owes you money, let her know you won't be buying her anything until you're paid back.\n\nShe can also start looking for a job if she wants fun money.", "NTA she is only friends for money", "You need to tell Amy's Mother. Amy is bulling you. Calling you mean names and trying to guilt you into spending your money on her. Listen what Amy is doing is bad. Amy's Mother needs to teach her that what she is doing is wrong.  And then after you need to block her. Amy is not a good friend.", "Would it be easier for one of your parents to clarify the situation with Amy's mum instead?", "NTA,\n\nWhat you have here is not a friend its called a \"mooch\" about damn time you stood up for yourself. I would suggest cutting her off completely. DO NOT PAY A SINGLE PENNY NO MATTER WHAT EXCUSE SHE USES /NEW WAY TO MANIPULATE YOU.   \nIn your life, you will find a lot of mooches, better to learn earlier in life how to deal with them.", "INFO Why were you ever paying anything for Amy? Why does Amy feel so entitled to your money?", "NTA. She\u2019s an entitled brat. She\u2019s using you and doesn\u2019t seem to actually care about you. \n\nI grew up poor. We were homeless a few times. I had a few decently wealthy friends, but I never once expected anything from them. In fact one friend stopped being my friend because I couldn\u2019t afford to do all the fun things they wanted to do so they found friends who could. And that\u2019s fine. \n\nShe should be grateful that you do these things for her. You sound like a good friend. But she sounds very toxic. It\u2019s best to step away.", "Amy is not your friend and you're NTA."]}
