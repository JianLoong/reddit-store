If each kid had to pay for the trip and that money was put towards the block of rooms, then Sam still wouldn't have been able to go if she couldn't afford it.", "Sure. My point is about the rule. Sam's finances are a separate issue to which OP has given us no insight (and she may well have no knowledge of that herself).", "<<They think that if I did, Sam would be nicer to us.>> \n\nYeah because she's was so nice before this?  Appeasing a bully does not change them for the better, it just encourages their behavior.\n\nOP=NTA", "Nah, totally not the butthole here op, it is as you said, you booked the room, and your father paid for it using his points, also, you said you have to use a CPAP machine, which, you stated you do not want any one to find out about, even if she was 17, she should have gone to the school and asked for help to get her own room, why should it be on you to make sure Sam got to go on this trip, I hate to say it like this, but it sounds like Sam just wanted a free room, without asking the school for help, that is not your fault op.", "Were there any other 18 year olds who could have gotten their own room so she could have bunked with another 17 year old? Maybe she should look at the way she treats people since no one wanted to share or switch rooms with her", ">A lot of people believe that you can actually manage people like this by doing what they want.\n\nInteresting that none of the other girls were willing to do anything--they just think OP should.  Definitely NTA.", "Same. Went to the east coast (I'm from the west coast) for 9 days the summer after 8th grade with my school. There were no adults in the rooms with the kids at all. They had their own rooms. They would put tape on the outside of kids room doors that would break if you opened it so that they could see if someone snuck out. Mind you, this was 20 years ago but still.", "Damn my class still went and we were terrified the whole time.", "NTA It was your room, not sams.", "Just say the truth and forget about it, \u201cshe\u2019s not really a friend, she\u2019s mean and that\u2019s why no one wanted to room with her. So I have neither the motivation nor the responsibility to answer to her or you for her situation. I had a great trip so I know I made the right choice.\u201d Don\u2019t be defensive, go on offense and squash it. NTA", "NTA. Bullies have consequences. And now since she didn't go because you wouldn't share with someone who was not at the very least polite to you, she is being mean to everyone now, not just you?", "She should have bunked with one of the other girl pairs. Hotels have cots and pull out couches for similar situations. If she had talked to another girl group and the hotel, she might have even gotten then to set her up with a third bed. Did she even talk to the school? I can\u2019t believe the school has never experienced this before. If she\u2019d rather have a full bed than go on the trip, that\u2019s up to her.", "Yeah these dynamics usually have a default scapegoat that takes the blame. The abusive person runs the show but others work for them. The friends suck too, but I think they are being manipulated", "Fun fact, I was stopped at the same intersection when one of the shootings occured"]}
