Your friends should stick up for you but based on this it sounds like they\u2019ve remained silent so far, making them shitty friends", "NTA. Dude is intentionally excluding you when he bent over backwards to pick a new date to accommodate the other person. Seems strange he couldn\u2019t verify the date works with everyone before locking it in. If your friends remained quiet in all of this then they\u2019re likely fine with it and that\u2019s a whole different problem."]}
