Nate and Jen are extremely well off. They both have high paying jobs and earn around $350k between them. Maddie and I are middle class. I own a small house and Maddie goes to a private school. Maddie has a good life but it doesn\u2019t compare to her cousins. \n\nMy brother and Jen rented a house for us and paid for the rental, all of the food, and all of the activities. The only thing I paid for was gas when driving myself and Maddie to the house. \n\nI also have to say Nate and I don\u2019t get along very well but I have a great relationship with Jen, mostly because of how they are with the kids. Nate tells the kids they don\u2019t have to be nice to anyone, never encourages them to share their toys, and doesn\u2019t discipline his kids. Jen is the opposite. She constantly tells the kids to share with their cousins and will punish them if they\u2019re being rude to the other kids or adults. \n\nNow to the vacation. They rented a 3 bedroom house. Nate and Jen had the master bedroom, I had the second bedroom with a double bed, and all of the kids were going to share a room with 2 bunk beds (4 beds). \n\nThe first night was pretty rough. The kids brought tons of toys but refused to let Maddie play with them. Jen came in and told them that before they left she told them they\u2019d have to share their toys so they either share or she takes them away. They were a little rude but mostly fine the rest of the night. The second night Jen went out to dinner with an old friend and Nate and I were home with the kids. We were getting the kids ready for bed and an argument broke out between the kids because Laura and Danny decided they don\u2019t want to share with Maddie and told her to sleep on the couch. I expected Nate to tell them that the bedroom was for all of the kids but he told Maddie that she either has to sleep with me or on the couch. \n\nI asked if he was serious and he said yes and that his kids weren\u2019t comfortable sharing with Maddie and since he paid for the house, he has a right to kick Maddie out of the room. \n\nI told Maddie to get her bag and that if she doesn\u2019t have a bed, we\u2019re going home. Maybe an hour after we left Jen came back and asked why Maddie and I left. I told her what happened and she asked me to come back and promised that she\u2019d take care of her husband and the kids because she wants her kids to have a good relationship with their cousins. \n\nI said no and shortly after we got home I got a call from my brother yelling at me for causing a scene, creating problems between him and his wife, and being ungrateful for a free vacation. He got our parents involved and they\u2019re agreeing that it\u2019s a free vacation and I can\u2019t be picky.

He is using his money (perceived power) as justification to be abusive to a child. Just because someone pays for things, doesn't give them permission to treat people like crap. It sounds like he wanted no part of OP and her daughter being there but wife wanted them there. That's why he waited until she was put of the house to be abusive. He expected OP and daughter to take it, but instead wife rightfully yelled at him.\n\nNTA, and OP's parents should be ashamed of themselves for condoning this behavior.", "I think you have to be a decent human being first to raise them \ud83e\udee0", "It\u2019s not \u201cfree\u201d when there\u2019s strings attached. In this case, OP and his daughter were treated like second class because they didn\u2019t pay for the vacation.\n\nNTA.", "Nailed it!!  The kids are clearly a reflection of their brother. Your parents are clearly a part of the reason why your brother is the way they he is. \n\nNTA", "If she does not get Nate to work with her parenting style, they will likely wind up with friendless, lazy, entitled kids. He is doing them a huge disservice teaching them to act like brats. Poor Jen. NTA", "It sounds more like Jen and Nate aren't arguing about the Iranian yogurt. They have opposing parenting styles and he's making her the bad cop. This is just one example of that issue. NTA. Kiddo comes first. Period. Good job OP.", "NTA. You stood up for your kid after your brother made unreasonable demands. It\u2019s striking that he expected you and your daughter to just take it because they paid for the vacation. Paying for a vacation is not a license to treat a child poorly.", "I mean picky? She just chose to leave. NTA\n\nI mean you don\u2019t really have to share your toys if you don\u2019t want to, but human decency is something else.", "And who knows, what if one of his \"angels\" want to have OPs room? Would he let them sleep them both on the couch or floor because \"he paid and he can decide\"?! That he treat his niece this way, horrible. \n\nNTA", "The cost of the vacation was being treated like garbage. Nope. No thank you. NTA.", "NTA. Tbh I don\u2019t feel sorry for Jen. I\u2019m sure she knew what kind of man she was having kids with, but she liked him and their lifestyle together enough to go ahead with it and convince herself that her being a good parent would be enough. I feel bad for the kids as well, but once they start becoming adults, they\u2019ll lose that as they gain the responsibility to figure out how to be good people on their own.", "And sounds like Nate is golden child.", "Not a vacation but a power trip. NTA", "Parents of op and Nate: IT's perfectly acceptable that for getting this free vacation that you and your child can be abused during the vacation and rules changed willy nilly by the other children.", "Right?? And Nate is the one who caused his own problems with his wife\u2026 NTA.", "They (dad and kids but dad is more responsible) are so awful they have to pay people to go on vacation with them and then they are so rotten that the people leave in disgust \n\nNTA", "EXACTLY! NTA\n\nHe said that if they don\u2019t want her in their room, She can sleep on the couch or with you, he forgot there is option 3 of sleeping in her own bed. Just because something is free doesn\u2019t mean you have to take it on any terms. \n\nAlso, good for you for not letting your daughter be bullied. She\u2019ll remember the bullying of being kicked out of a room and forced to sleep on the couch much more than any memories of a good free vacation. The vacation is not free if she is the punching bag - it has a huge psychological toll.", "I agree with everything you said, but is it the mom or the dad that was on vacation with the daughter? I didn't see op identify themselves either way. I may have missed it though.", "I'm stubborn and petty sometimes, so OP shouldn't listen to me. I would have told them that it's all good and to not worry because it would never be a problem again. I would leave it at that. Then, I would never go on vacation with any of them (except maybe Jen) again.", "I feel sorry for the kids too! They're being entitled little sh\\*ts for sure, but it's almost impossible  for them not to be, with their dad completely undermining every lesson mom tries to set. \n\nI have sympathy, but Jen is also a little bit to blame here -- she may be trying but at the very least, she's being ineffective and a massive pushover with regards to her husband. She has to know what he's doing, and that all the \"now kids, I told you to share\" in the world is not going to make an ounce of difference in a situation like this. \n\nApplaud OP for being NTA here though, and showing her daughter that she matters as a person no matter what and can't be \"bought.\"", "I agree and I see divorce coming down the road if brother doesn\u2019t shape up.  At $350k combined income, his wife has options.  She doesn\u2019t have to put up with her husband\u2019s douchebaggery and leaving him might be the only way she can show her kids that his behavior is unacceptable.", "I think OP is a woman, but overall, I'd say it's a good point. NTA", "Especially a *child.* Imagine inviting a kid on a vacation and then taking her bed away and telling her she has to sleep on the couch like she\u2019s a second class citizen. Fucking vile.", "Yeah, there is a lot of space between heartless bullies and having boundaries.  I agree we need more detail.", "Yeah, sharing is nice, but it kinda reads that because Nate's kids have the better toys they should share with Maddie all the time, which isn't very fair to Nate's kids. I mean, kids deserve boundaries, and it legitimately seems like the argument was about having to share so much with Maddie. Be honest, are they friends with Maddie?", "Literally the point was that op left the vacation when she was getting treated badly.", "We have no indications that any type of \u201cmooching\u201d, as you call it, was happening before or during this vacation. What are you on about?", "Bro typed this whole thing out and thought he was right \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80. You aren't a clown you the whole Damm circus", "Found Nate.", "The only one with entitlement issues is the OP's brother. He thinks that just because he provided a vacation for his sister and her daughter, one that HE AND HIS WIFE OFFERED, that he is somehow entitled to utter obedience in whatever ridiculous scenario he's concocted. It's to make himself feel powerful.\n\nAnd you're either the OP's brother or somebody who has the same tendency to think that just because you have money that it means everybody should bow down to you and accept everything you have given them, no questions asked.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I had no idea it's call \"picky\" when you decide you no long want to allow someone to shit all over you....", "Lol. Nice pun.", "Haha I see what you did there.", "Guess who was the golden child! Nate probably always got his way.  Of course, the parents think OP should accept Nate's abuse.", "I don't think that's a petty answer at all.  I think that's perfectly valid to react that way.  OP and kid were treated very poorly.", "1. this clearly isn\u2019t new behavior. 2. actually she left when daughter was told to share a bed with her. the day prior (and it seems like many times in the past) they have been mean and refused to share/play with her.", "Bratty cousins isn't mistreated IMO. \n\nMainly tho, it's clear the brother is consistently an issue. If she's not able to deal with that - that they have different views on sharing, largely - then why go? \n\nShe thought he was magically going to be a different human all of a sudden? \n\nAnd really - having her child sleep with her to me is just not a horrible thing. She could just say, your cousins aren't great at sharing but we're going to have a sleepover! \n\nBut bc she hates her brother's attitude, she's going to go over the top in deciding that sharing a room is the hill she's going to die on. If that had been the suggestion to start, she probably wouldn't have been offended. It's that her brother used the \"i paid i get the say\" card - which sucks but she didn't have to let it ruin the trip. I mean that's the issue IMO. \n\nDid everyone's cousins and siblings always share perfectly with them? I mean it's weird that ppl are calling this abuse.", "Don't listen to that clown. You're NOT mooching. If someone invites you and said I will pay for everything, don't worry. Then, they set that standard.", "You were invited as a guest not for your child to be a punching bag for 2 little AH in training \n\nLet me guess, has your brother always treated you like crap and now by extension your child? \n\nAnd why? Because he earns more? He doesn\u2019t have enough money to fix his biggest problem, his personality", "Yet he acts as if you begged him to come along and he pays for you, NTA.", "I can read between the lines.

Taking someone up on there offer is not entitlement. You are delusional and ridiculous.", "and the times before? she knew how her daughter would be treated by her cousins. she specifically stated she and nate don\u2019t get along for this reason. she continues putting her child in these circumstances and only intervened when her comfort was compromised", "Shrug. it\u2019s my opinion which is the entire reason for this forum.\n\nbtw it\u2019s their not there ; )", "I think that Jen has put a stop to most of the bullying, as op stated that she usually disciplines her kids, and that op has a close relationship with her, which it\u2019s most likely why they went."]}
