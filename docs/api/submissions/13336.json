Nate and Jen are extremely well off. They both have high paying jobs and earn around $350k between them. Maddie and I are middle class. I own a small house and Maddie goes to a private school. Maddie has a good life but it doesn\u2019t compare to her cousins. \n\nMy brother and Jen rented a house for us and paid for the rental, all of the food, and all of the activities. The only thing I paid for was gas when driving myself and Maddie to the house. \n\nI also have to say Nate and I don\u2019t get along very well but I have a great relationship with Jen, mostly because of how they are with the kids. Nate tells the kids they don\u2019t have to be nice to anyone, never encourages them to share their toys, and doesn\u2019t discipline his kids. Jen is the opposite. She constantly tells the kids to share with their cousins and will punish them if they\u2019re being rude to the other kids or adults. \n\nNow to the vacation. They rented a 3 bedroom house. Nate and Jen had the master bedroom, I had the second bedroom with a double bed, and all of the kids were going to share a room with 2 bunk beds (4 beds). \n\nThe first night was pretty rough. The kids brought tons of toys but refused to let Maddie play with them. Jen came in and told them that before they left she told them they\u2019d have to share their toys so they either share or she takes them away. They were a little rude but mostly fine the rest of the night. The second night Jen went out to dinner with an old friend and Nate and I were home with the kids. We were getting the kids ready for bed and an argument broke out between the kids because Laura and Danny decided they don\u2019t want to share with Maddie and told her to sleep on the couch. I expected Nate to tell them that the bedroom was for all of the kids but he told Maddie that she either has to sleep with me or on the couch. \n\nI asked if he was serious and he said yes and that his kids weren\u2019t comfortable sharing with Maddie and since he paid for the house, he has a right to kick Maddie out of the room. \n\nI told Maddie to get her bag and that if she doesn\u2019t have a bed, we\u2019re going home. Maybe an hour after we left Jen came back and asked why Maddie and I left. I told her what happened and she asked me to come back and promised that she\u2019d take care of her husband and the kids because she wants her kids to have a good relationship with their cousins. \n\nI said no and shortly after we got home I got a call from my brother yelling at me for causing a scene, creating problems between him and his wife, and being ungrateful for a free vacation. He got our parents involved and they\u2019re agreeing that it\u2019s a free vacation and I can\u2019t be picky.

In fact, for being called out on his behavior, he blamed you for it. that's not healthy and you will be better off setting boundaries to keep that kind of toxicity away from you and Maddie. \n\nI almost feel worse for Jen because she has no partner in her marriage, at least on the child rearing front.

When we invite people along on our vacations we are fortunate enough to be able to afford, we treat them as guests, not an afterthought who should 'just be grateful'.

It doesn't require handing over one's dignity at the door in order to appear grateful.  What would you have done instead as a parent?
