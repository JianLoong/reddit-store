Nate and Jen are extremely well off. They both have high paying jobs and earn around $350k between them. Maddie and I are middle class. I own a small house and Maddie goes to a private school. Maddie has a good life but it doesn\u2019t compare to her cousins. \n\nMy brother and Jen rented a house for us and paid for the rental, all of the food, and all of the activities. The only thing I paid for was gas when driving myself and Maddie to the house. \n\nI also have to say Nate and I don\u2019t get along very well but I have a great relationship with Jen, mostly because of how they are with the kids. Nate tells the kids they don\u2019t have to be nice to anyone, never encourages them to share their toys, and doesn\u2019t discipline his kids. Jen is the opposite. She constantly tells the kids to share with their cousins and will punish them if they\u2019re being rude to the other kids or adults. \n\nNow to the vacation. They rented a 3 bedroom house. Nate and Jen had the master bedroom, I had the second bedroom with a double bed, and all of the kids were going to share a room with 2 bunk beds (4 beds). \n\nThe first night was pretty rough. The kids brought tons of toys but refused to let Maddie play with them. Jen came in and told them that before they left she told them they\u2019d have to share their toys so they either share or she takes them away. They were a little rude but mostly fine the rest of the night. The second night Jen went out to dinner with an old friend and Nate and I were home with the kids. We were getting the kids ready for bed and an argument broke out between the kids because Laura and Danny decided they don\u2019t want to share with Maddie and told her to sleep on the couch. I expected Nate to tell them that the bedroom was for all of the kids but he told Maddie that she either has to sleep with me or on the couch. \n\nI asked if he was serious and he said yes and that his kids weren\u2019t comfortable sharing with Maddie and since he paid for the house, he has a right to kick Maddie out of the room. \n\nI told Maddie to get her bag and that if she doesn\u2019t have a bed, we\u2019re going home. Maybe an hour after we left Jen came back and asked why Maddie and I left. I told her what happened and she asked me to come back and promised that she\u2019d take care of her husband and the kids because she wants her kids to have a good relationship with their cousins. \n\nI said no and shortly after we got home I got a call from my brother yelling at me for causing a scene, creating problems between him and his wife, and being ungrateful for a free vacation. He got our parents involved and they\u2019re agreeing that it\u2019s a free vacation and I can\u2019t be picky.

The kids (7 of us including me) slept in the living room. Side note - we weren\u2019t kids really, we were all in our early 20s taking a massive family vacation/reunion type thing. \n\nAnyways. There was one couch, it turned into a full bed but guess what happened? Little miss princess, younger than me and one other cousin decided she wanted the couch for the entire trip.

She wouldn\u2019t let us turn it into a bed because that would mean she would have to share sleeping with someone on it. We all slept on the floor and our agreement was to take turns sleeping on the couch, we were there for 7 nights and there was 7 of us so each of us would get a turn on the couch. But nope. This spoiled brat of a cousin (who was an only child btw) got the couch all 7 nights. And when it came time for dinner, we\u2019d all take votes on what we wanted to eat that night.

Disagreement _within a normal/healthy range_ about how/how much to punish your kids can be resolved, but if the other parent is determined to take a lazier, easier shortcut that allows the kids to be as obnoxious as they want, it's going to be well-nigh impossible to keep them on the straight and narrow.\n\nI really feel for the Jens of this world. My husband made the right noises before we had kids but I had no way of knowing he'd live up to any of it. Many don't, and worse. It's not like there aren't things I wish he'd do/not do (and vice versa, I'm sure) but we've been enough on the same page to stay mostly happy, sane and consistent with our girls. *Neither* of us would allow them to behave like Nate's kids.", "She is, I daresay, *morally obligated* to leave him and take the kids. Clearly, he thinks he's a real alpha male and the shit and he is teaching his kids that they are too. That they should only look out for number one and that what they want is all that matters. She needs to get her kids away from that kind of influence NOW.

It likely wasn\u2019t the kids decision to invite others and give up their stuff.  Also, if you invite guests to your vacation home they\u2019re probably bringing the beer and wine to share, as good guests do! Are OP and Maddie contributing to the toys and fun for everyone to share?", "I mean that could be the case. OP has not said. It's not clear if this is continuation of them not wanting to share their toys or something else.\n\nI didn't know that classic sleepover bullying was a thing, no less when parents of both kids are around. Left completely unexplained I don't think it's right to assume why they did not want to share or that it was inappropriate. Most kids don't act like monsters for no reason whatsoever. It's entirely possible that Maddie was being rude to them, bullying them, taking their toys, etc. \n\nI wouldn't assume that either, which is to say there's really not enough information here besides OP painting an evil caricature of her brother.", "Please ignore this dumb comment. Nate is being an awful human and terrible uncle. Your parents are really wrong too.\n\nThe only person whose opinion matters is Maddie\u2019s. One day she will remember how you stood up for her against her AH rich uncle and his snotty kids, and she will remember that you\u2019re a strong mom who always protected her.\n\nYour parents opinion and Nate\u2019s - and even Jen - none of that matters. \n\nNTA", "What was the argument about?

They knew going into the vacation she\u2019d be there and as such should have been expected to treat Maddie properly, which includes sharing with her and including her. If we can\u2019t set expectations for proper behavior with children because they didn\u2019t choose the circumstances, then we can *never* have any expectations for them because they don\u2019t choose their circumstances. You can just as easily say \u201cthey don\u2019t go to school so they shouldn\u2019t be forced to talk respectfully to teachers.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t choose to have siblings so you can\u2019t expect them not to bully their siblings.\u201d And on and on.", ">Most kids don't act like monsters for no reason whatsoever.\n\nYeah.

She said what they were fighting about (that\u2019s what \u2018because\u2019 means) you just aren\u2019t interpreting it that way. I think group ganging-up dynamics in young kids and adolescents are very common and easy enough for kids to fall into that we don\u2019t need to assume Maddie was being a bad kid or need to act like there\u2019s simply not enough info to know. Especially since the older child, Laura, is more than old enough to know that she should seek an adult\u2019s help if Maddie is acting shitty. If Maddie was being annoying or rude and she didn\u2019t want her to sleep in there, she could\u2019ve petitioned her dad directly instead of arguing with Maddie. \n\nHere\u2019s what almost certainly happened. Nate and Jen plan a vacation. Jen suggests inviting OP and Maddie. Nate says \u201cis she going to pay?!?!\u201d Jen says \u201cwe\u2019re already paying for the house anyway, let\u2019s treat her. I\u2019d love to have Maddie along.\u201d Nate is miffed and spends weeks or months, however long it was planned, openly complaining about how his sister was leeching off of him and asking bullying questions like \u201cdid she even OFFER to pay??\u201d The kids come into the vacation already against Maddie, whom the immediately set about excluding. Their mom already prevented them from one cruelty, refusing to share. So, when they don\u2019t think the adults are paying attention, they try to kick her out of the bedroom. This gets escalated by Maddie. A fight ensues between OP and her brother. Bada bing, bada boom. Pretty classic interfamilial conflict.", "Op would have only been entitled if they demanded a bed for their child.  Op is their parent.  Clothing, food, and a bed to sleep on is what many people consider the bare minimum required of a parent.  Op decided that if their was no bed for their child, then they would go home to their bed.\n\nIt would be different if there was no bed for Op\u2019s child.  Then, of course, stick her on the bed or with her parent.  There were two free beds.  There were two free beds and Op\u2019s brother wants the kid to sleep on the couch.  Op has every right to object and leave.

Large businesses are playing the parents now.  In most states you have one year to charge shoplifters.  What people do not realize is that they can aggregate the amounts for that year.  Once it is over the felony amount, they hit them with charges.  A lot of the rich parents were in for a shock as they never got in trouble for the minor shoplifting and vandalism.  They thought it was funny their kids were doing the same thing until the kids got charged with a felony.", "That\u2019s going a bit extreme.\n\nI\u2019m just saying, to some people (and not saying this is OP!) \u201csharing\u201d means they get to roll up with nothing, take whatever it is immediately when they want it regardless of who is using it, and do whatever they want.", "Could be.... or since we're envisioning possible scenarios, perhaps Maddie asked Danny to play with his Nintendo Switch for the 50th time and Danny was sick of it.\n\nThe writing is unclear if the fight is about sharing toys or sharing the room. There's so much written about sharing toys that I'm inclined to think that was yet again the conflict, but it's hard to say.\n\nNate also says his kids were uncomfortable sharing the room with Maddie. Let's assume for a moment that it's true and that there's a valid reason because why shouldn't we? We take everything OP has shared at face value.

To be okay with one of their grandkids being othered in this way (because \"free\" vacation....really?), and suggesting that OP and that grandkid suck it up, is all kinds of wrong.  \n\nThis kind of dynamic, where one or more family members get treated badly, and when it seems to be enforced by other family members, is absolutely worth breaking.\n\nOP can have a wonderful vacation with her daughter, without any of the crap that her parents and brother insist on dragging in.  OP should also insist that (outside of vacations, which hopefully won't happen again for some time, if ever), when they get together as a 3-generation family, neither she nor her daughter are othered - I feel like that has happened before to them.\n\nI also feel sorry for Jen....and her kids, who are being encouraged to be awful to their cousin to please their father.", "And why INVITE them if you are going to treat them this way?

OP's vacation seems like hard work to me.", "350k is absolutely rich. Sure, it isn't like Jeff Bezos rich or old money aristocrat rich, but it's quite literally FIVE TIMES the median household income in the US (70k). It's literally the second highest tax bracket for US federal taxes. I don't say this to be mean to you, but you are 100% in a bubble if your family makes $350k but you don't think you're rich. People from wealthy families often do this because there's always someone they know that's way richer, so they don't understand how far above the rest of us they are. If you are going around and telling most people that aren't in your income bracket that your family isn't rich when your dad makes $350k a year, you're going to come across as a super out of touch rich kid. When I went to college in like 2015, my parents filed their household income as $60k (which was around the median then) and we considered ourselves pretty middle-of-the-road middle class. We weren't struggling to make ends meet and we occasionally went on modest vacations (usually they doubled as trips to see family or to tour a college or something like that later on). $350k yearly is rich.", "But FAMILY!?! \ud83e\udd23"]}
