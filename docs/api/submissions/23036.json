You can put dollar limits on how much you'll contribute to her upkeep, you don't get to say \"Why are you buying the Zesta saltines when the Premium are $0.50 off this week!?!?!\"", "YTA. Might be controversial, I\u2019ve been the daughter in this situation so my opinion is probably biased but I think what you\u2019re doing is food shaming and overbearing. It may come from not understanding her situation well enough, or perhaps having too high of expectations for her. Have you asked her if she has time to cook as often as the first year? Study load increases from 2nd year onwards. Calling it decadent and wasteful is harsh- isn\u2019t it better that she\u2019s eating at least? She isn\u2019t going out to expensive restaurants, or wasting the money on trivial things. Food is a necessity. \n\nMy own parents offered to help me with money when I moved out (I was 17 at the time), and they would complain I was spending too much on delivery or junk food but when I explained that it was either I organise the junk/ easy food or not eat at all because I didn\u2019t have the time/energy with my studies, they were more understanding. However, their initial response caused me to eat less, or avoid ordering at all because I\u2019d felt bad about my inability to cook for myself and the fact that I had to ask them for help. I\u2019d worry that putting this kind of pressure or restriction on something like food could spiral into a larger problem, and I can maaaybe see how in this situation it could come across as restrictive or that you\u2019re implying she \u2018indulges\u2019 too much which ties in with the weight based reaction from her. \n\nDelivery twice a week and pizza is not that bad - pizza can be reheated and eaten for follow on meals for example. Pizza can also be cheaper than a lot of grocery meals too as they have student deals (this is in Aus though- not sure if it\u2019s the same in the US). The mental drain of preparing a meal on top of an increased workload is sometimes just too much.\n\nI think being so strict with the grocery list and accompanying her to the grocery store is toxic and goes back on your trust of her. I think a gift card is a fantastic idea, it enables her to keep her autonomy without her feeling trapped or like you\u2019re trying to dictate what she can/can\u2019t eat. If she chooses to use it on junk food then that\u2019s on her, but it\u2019s not fair to offer support and help and then put restrictions on it because it\u2019s not turning out exactly how you expected. \n\nI hope this helps offer an alternative perspective! I said YTA for some of your wording, high expectations, and controlling behaviour. I understand you\u2019re parents, but gifts and support like this shouldn\u2019t have parameters, as long as she\u2019s able to eat and she\u2019s healthy as a human, that\u2019s what should be important.", "NTA. Adults buy things themselves if they want to splurge. Is she an adult, or a child? I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to ask her.", "On the fence with this one. I get that you want her to make good choices and it\u2019s your money and you don\u2019t have to help her but it kinda seems like  you\u2019re trying to dictate her diet and implying you don\u2019t trust her ability to make decisions as an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s a little controlling on some level but I get it and you\u2019re NTA. \n\nHowever, I do have to ask how you know what she\u2019s been buying if she\u2019s over two hours away.

(We're not going to even *talk* about how many beers and seltzers it probably includes...)", "Okay, that helps put it into perspective. To be very honest with you, I am 26 and I'm going to assume that you are probably a bit younger than my mom and I will say (sorry for generalizing) women in your generation have a tendency to talk about food in a way that can be judgement and damaging to their daughters. It can be very subtle but I have plenty of girlfriends and we compare notes \ud83d\ude06. I do not think it's your fault, i know MY  mom doesn't mean any harm to me there but I have still felt it. but it IS a pattern.\n\nConsidering your daughter has a full ride and you describe her as generally responsible and she really is not asking for much - I would give her $250 at the start of each semester (about $50 per month) and tell her it's up to her to budget it. I'm assuming that scholarship has strings attached and school will continue to get harder as she progresses.\n\nI would honestly just leave the food thing alone and let her manage herself, and just let her know what the budget is. I'm sure it's stressful to ask ad hoc like that, not knowing what the limit is. \n\nBTW I do not think you're an asshole, I just think the best thing is to drop it.", "I want to be on your side really bad but this attitude will really damage your relationship with your daughter. She's definitely under immense pressure if she's maintaining a full academic scholarship. She's paying her way through school with her hard academic work and the money from her summer job. $50 a month is very little for her to ask of her parents to help her through this time in her life. And socializing is very important. Please give her a break.", "Well to be fair they did offer and she\u2019s on university and a lot of parents help their kids out during this time because they are focused on their studies", "Agreed, but that only works if she has a car at college. A lot of kids don't.", "40 hours a week ON TOP OF school?  If so, that's A LOT!\n\nSomeone told me that you need to plan for 3 hours of homework every week for every unit you take. So if she's taking 15 units AND working 40 hours, that's an 80+ hour week. ~~If that's the case, YTA.~~", "Wait, is she in school full time and working a 40hr/wk job? Because that's a lot. Not saying you should be paying for door dash taco bell, that's just wasteful, but if she's doing both school and work I can understand needing easy options. Maybe talk over what would fill those needs, like a stash of frozen pizzas/burritos?", "I don't know if you order McDonald's DD or Uber or not, but I can buy one meal at McDonald's through door dash for $30 or go to the restaurant and order myself for $10. It's wasteful if it's not needed.", "Having fast food delivered twice a week is definitely very wasteful. \n\nIf you're going to eat food that unhealthy to begin with(no judgement, but lets be real about it), then you may as well just buy frozen meals at the grocery store which are still like 1/4 the price at the end of the day.\n\nAlso kind of x to doubt on the whole being busy thing... yea school is work but it's sure as hell nowhere near as busy as having a full time job with a family.\n\nThe fact that OP's daughter made this work perfectly fine for the first year confirms that it's not a matter of being unable to make it work. It's just being lazy/taking the easy solution.", "As long as she has some semblance of a healthy diet, if she needs to rely on the occasional processed prepackaged meal, that's not a huge problem.", "True walking distance would be the way though.  Ordering take out all the time gets expensive.  Or get food from campus", "It's only 40 hours a week during the summer.", "It's 40 hours a week during the summer.", "Whoa seriously? In UK I can get a mcdonalds delivery for around \u00a38-9 (burger, chips, coke & delivery).", "But does she have the time to handle cooking herself some meals? I\u2019m all for healthy eating habits, but even as an adult who sometimes gets overwhelmed with work, I can\u2019t always cook if I\u2019m too busy.", "I think this still has the same underlying issue. I think it's awesome that you're willing to help your daughter with expenses while she's in school.\n\nAnd I'm okay with saying- we're willing to pay for this and not that. But you raised her- you presumably taught her healthy eating. How to make good food choices.\n\nYou need to trust that you did that.\n\nYes, by all means talk to her about whether she needs things like cookbooks to make it easier to cook for herself so she can make a healthy meal for 1 or 2. \n\nBut the end is you still need to trust your child.", "So why isn't she paying for her fast food trips then?", "When I was her age, getting taken grocery shopping by my mom was enough to make me cry tears of joy. If I knew she was driving in to take me, I\u2019d meticulously meal plan and make my list ahead of time. She\u2019d also buy me a few snacky/junky treats too. \n\nMy part time retail paycheck wasn\u2019t stretching far enough and I was always super grateful for the help, especially because I knew money was tight for my mom, too. \n\nI would treat myself occasionally (maybe once every week or two), but this was pre-DoorDash, so I would pick it up myself, so it wasn\u2019t as big of an expenditure. Granted, I was in a very walkable city, so I didn\u2019t have to walk more than a mile to pick anything up. Shit, even as an adult in a DINK household where we make pretty damn good money, I still don\u2019t order delivery more than once a week. More than that feels like I\u2019m throwing my money away. \n\nIf she feels like you\u2019re judging her food choices, I agree that grocery store gift cards are a great idea!", "NTA - But it does sound like she is using junk food as a coping mechanism.", "Info can you send her a gift card to a local grocery store?  Or a chain, like Walmart thats near her?  Does she have a meal plan on campus? Does she have transport to the store?", "Why not just get her a gift card to her local supermarket?  Do you really need to make a 4 hour round trip just to control what food she buys?  I can see not giving her cash for her Door Dash habit-- such a total rip off, but what's wrong with letting her have some amount of choice in what she buys from the grocery store.", "INFO: Have you tried to talk to her about why she\u2019s eating like that and not cooking, or have you just told her she\u2019s eating wrong and has to change? \n\nThere might be issues with sharing a kitchen with someone, managing dishes and cooking and schoolwork, or something else you\u2019re just not seeing. The way you\u2019re going about it does lean more into shaming than helping, especially because you didn\u2019t tell her beforehand that you had those restrictions for paying for her food.", "On my last visit to college DD, I asked if she wanted me to take her to dinner or buy her groceries. She chose groceries.", "I would have loved that when I was broke!", "NAH. I understand you don\u2019t want her ordering junk, but insisting on doing the grocery shopping for her is micromanaging. Send her grocery store gift cards.", "NTA, its your money", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t get to tell your adult daughter what she gets to eat. If she wants to go buy a cart full of nothing but coke, cake and ice cream, that\u2019s her business.", "NTA.  Fast food twice a week isn\u2019t that bad, but having it delivered is ridiculous.", "NTA, not wanting her to constantly waste money on junk and get unhealthy isnt fat shaming.", "YTA for thinking it\u2019s so you can control her \u201ctaking care of herself & making good financial decisions\u201d you want to control how you\u2019re money is used, that\u2019s fair. Your kid is a kid and they should have an opportunity to make bad choices and do dumb stuff and still have parental support/love. \nYou need to make clearer boundaries - you have raised your kid to expect financial help from you they are throwing a tantrum because they can\u2019t get what they want. The fact that they were honest with you about how they used their money and you are using that information to control what they eat, is YTA moves. There\u2019s something fishy in this situation, I doubt you would miss the money, if you\u2019re willing to go shopping for her, this isn\u2019t about money. It\u2019s about control. \n\nThat she is not prepared to work full time and cook for herself, is a lack of training and preparation on your part. That she\u2019s calling you names, shows that she could do that and get away with it before and have it work. \nYTA for wanting her to learn these live lessons but not prepare her with the tools needed. \n\nNTA for wanting to take your kid grocery shopping instead of giving them money.\nBut that\u2019s not what this is about.", "u/HourDare7683,\n\n>She knows how to cook, how to budget and meal plan.\n\nI'll get to your fundamental question in a moment. First I want to thank you for good parenting. I'm so sick and tired of kids showing up on cooking subs and Facebook groups moving out or graduating college who can't feed themselves. \n\nSo you have a behavior problem with your daughter, not a knowledge problem. \n\nNTA. Not even close. \n\nSpeculation on my part, I wonder if the \"fat shaming\" comment is because she is gaining weight and feels bad about it, but not bad enough to change recent behavior. \n\nI think you're being good parents and responding to poor behavior. She's been lazy. That may (*may*) indicate a time management problem on her part that you should (<-opinion) be alert to. \n\nA thought for your quiver is to set up an account at her local grocery story with your credit card for curbside pickup (the silver lining of COVID). She can shop from home and then go pick things up and you get receipts. \n\nShe knows better but isn't acting better. \n\nYou really don't need my support, but frankly there is simply no excuse for DoorDash and UberEats et al for college kids. \n\nBest wishes.", "Only problem is that this might get spent on booze. Unless it\u2019s possible to put restrictions in grocery cards somehow", "I agree with you but when i was at uni i found ot significantly easier and quicker to boil some pasta and add pesto, or throw some veggies and a piece of fish on a tray and bake it, than ordering food.", "Twice a week is not living off it. Let's exclude breakfast and just say 14 meals a week, 2 of them being a quick delivery while studying is not that big a deal.

YTA, not because you  (OP as \"you\" henceforth, not you, deefop) won't give her money, but because you *are* kinda fatshaming her, deciding what she gets to eat. if you were **actually** concerned about the spending of the money, you would've stated it like \"it's getting expensive paying for all this take-out so often,\" but you didn't.", "You missed the /s right?  From what I read so far, OP doesn't mention the daughter's major. Some majors are more intense than others. \n\nI was a music education major. 18-21 credits were the norm, but the kicker was, my most time intense classes were only one credit and were 7-12 hours a week (orchestra, wind ensemble, marching band).
