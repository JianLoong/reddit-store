Except that it clearly doesn\u2019t, at least not this particular Sunday, and I don\u2019t think your husband\u2019s father is being unreasonable. Again, if it were the actual birthday I\u2019d agree that the kid\u2019s day is way more important than football, but it\u2019s not- you\u2019ve set up this weird awkward situation that\u2019s just completely unnecessary. I\u2019m not that into football either but I understand it\u2019s like a holiday for a lot of people, and while you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t hold it against people who don\u2019t come you also say that *your husband and his father are already fighting over it*.

I think it\u2019s inconsiderate to schedule something on days where you know many of the people coming will have plans making attending your party either not possible  or very inconvenient.

An hour and a half may seem like a lot but if people want to have things prepared at home, etc it's not much when travel is factored in. Should have thought of timing quite a while ago. Or made it earlier. That is a long time for a kids party. Goodness. \n\nAt least you say you won't be upset if people skip it.", "Assuming this is the US, YTA.

You scheduled the party fine, but some people have their own game day events that they want time to prepare for. Some people take the Super Bowl very seriously after all.", "YTA - it's a very selfish, \"my child or your own interests\" kind of attitude.  People who are avid football fans live for this day.  They live for this party.  They either want to host their own party or attend someone else's.

Your stubbornness just seems selfish and thoughtless.", "YTA.

Your reasoning for this is that \u201cSundays work better for our family\u201d but go on to explain that your husband\u2019s parents are terrible people for not wanting to exchange Super Bowl Sunday for a child\u2019s birthday party. You seem to lack both rational thinking skills as well as an ability to see more than one side of a pretty simple situation. You should reconsider the party- maybe have it on his birthday since it\u2019s the day before- if it\u2019s not too late.", "YTA. Why wouldn't you have the party on a Saturday? Like a normal birthday party...", "YTA. The Super Bowl is important to a lot of people, including some of your family members, and all in is more involved than just turning the game on.\n\nAt the same time, family members will put their 3 year old relative ahead of the Super Bowl anyway, so you're inconveniencing them.\n\nIf this isn't excessively difficult to change, you should.", "Yta. You have plenty of time change the date to Saturday still.", "Honest. Yta.", " I hope my Eagles (from Phila area) are in but I actually enjoy the party the squares, the food, the commercials and halftime more than the game lol.

My bday is right after the possible date to fall on Sunday, and my sisters birthday is during the possible dates. So 3 people in my family have had to postpone our bday weekend because of the Superbowl, but then the following week is Valentines Day. \n\nIt sucks, but we coordinate so it\u2019s not interfering, so that we don\u2019t end up with no one at our party.

Maybe he\u2019ll love football and won\u2019t mind sharing his birthday as he grows up, but it\u2019s still nice to have a birthday where everyone isn\u2019t distracted and talking about the big game, even if it is earlier in the day.", "Why not one day early on Saturday?

Just because *you* treat it like a holiday doesn't mean that's how a majority of Americans are.", "I do too.", "Yes, I am aware. That doesn't change my opinion that the above comment is an exaggeration.", "Fair enough, I'm not from the US so maybe I'm underestimating the social and cultural importance of the Superbowl. To me it's a kid's birthday party and a match \ud83e\udd37", "I hate football, and I spend most Super Bowl Sundays making/eating snacks and having someone try to explain the rules to me. I'm still happily ignorant, but I make some great finger foods!", "That's not really in the post though. The post is pretty vague about your MIL and FIL's objections and says nothing about your husband. If that's the issue you want voting on, then you gotta actually describe that situation.", "You: \u201cit\u2019s ok if people don\u2019t come, no hard feelies.\u201d Also you: \u201canyway we\u2019re pretty fuckin upset dads not coming, I mean what the fuck?\u201d", "That's unfair. FIL isn't saying the game is more important than the boy. He's saying his son should know how much he enjoys celebrating SBS and that since the date for the game is beyond anyone's control that his son and DIL would be considerate enough to pick a day where there's no conflict.\n\nYou're making him choose and that's underhanded. No, the times do not coincide but you can't be dim enough to not realize the pregame celebration is important too.\n\nThe more I read this, the more it sounds deliberate. Making a point, disregarding others' enjoyment, I don't know. but this whole thing would have been avoided if you'd just given it some thought.", "I mean there\u2019s no reason to set up that dichotomy. Your FIL and mom can love your son far more than football and also be irritated that his birthday party was unnecessarily set up to conflict with Super Bowl Sunday. As a non-football fan, you didn\u2019t see this as a conflict. But a 530 kickoff means the parties will start earlier, as football fans will want to greet each other, set up squares etc, and settle in to watch before the game starts. The timing is much closer than you thought, especially with travel time and because Superbowl parties are often potlucks. Beyond that, it is a significant social event for many people so the day is limited- I wouldn\u2019t want to go to a separate party on Christmas Eve even if my plans didn\u2019t directly overlap. \n\nNAH but I do suggest you move the party to 12-3 if that works with nap time and don\u2019t make this an index of love.", "Cool this changes my vote to YTA for wording the post to describe a situation different from the one you\u2019re actually in. It sounds like you\u2019re deliberately stirring the pot and also your actual post doesn\u2019t reflect the husband thing. Please repost it correctly and let\u2019s go from there", "Whoa. The idea that \u201cfootball is more important than his grandson\u201d is the issue here, and not \u201cis the Super Bowl conflicting with the party\u201d.\n\nThe Super Bowl is a moment in time that allows grown adults to partner with other grown adults, and cheer like teenagers for \u201ctheir team\u201d, eat party food, watch the commercials, and have a moment that is enjoyed by a large percentage of the USA. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s once a year. And it\u2019s a planned date.\n\nTo equate football with the Super Bowl, isn\u2019t fair, nor is it helpful.\n\nYour husband is wrong on this one. I would move the party, because a child\u2019s party isn\u2019t going to have the same vibe as the Super Bowl, nor should it.\n\nYour son deserves everyone\u2019s full attention, and that will not happen in Super Bowl Sunday.", "These are the bad vibes a scheduling like this creates. This is all on you, this type of stuff is 100% inevitable with this scheduling, which you should know.\n\nBe smarter in the future and don't double-schedule common social event days, it will ALWAYS create bad vibes in one way or another.  Don't force an \"us vs them\" scenario.\n\nThis is exactly why \"they're free to choose\" is a cop out excuse.  No, they're not.  People will get upset like this.", "How would your husband fell better when all tell him he is wrong?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut very well: Tell your husband he is wrong.", "Have you also had a store bought superbowl cake stand in as a birthday cake?", "Ugh that's even worse. I'm sorry D:", "Not all Americans celebrate Christmas but you still know many people do and should work around that.", "I am in the US and don't get the \"social and cultural importance of the Super Bowl\"\ud83d\ude02. That said, I know many people who treat it like a holiday, and it really can be an all day event.", "There is also the issue those parties usually start hours before with socializing and BBQ and pregame fun.", "Would you feel the same if your football (soccer) team was in the final of the World Cup? That\u2019s similar to how many Americans view the Super Bowl. I couldn\u2019t care less but I know many who do.", "It's the biggest of a year and an occasion to have a huge party.  People who don't like football like the halftime music performance and commercials.  Yes they literally watch for the commercials", "OK, I cancelled my downvote from above. Super Bowl Sunday is a big deal. It's not just a game, it's an event. Even those lukewarm towards the sport enjoy the party atmosphere. People will plan gatherings for before, during, and after the game. Lots of delicious food and drink and sometimes games. Think a New Year's Eve party where midnight is three hours long. For a lot of people the game itself is secondary, especially if your team isn't playing. It's the food and fun and camaraderie. For a 5:30 game, people will start the party at 1 or thereabouts so it really is a conflict for anyone having a party.", "And the cooking! The cooking can take hours! We usually start cooking at 10am and cook all throught the day.", "Laughable example.\n\nAll Americans know when Christmas is. Most businesses are closed. People who don't care about the Superbowl don't even know what day it's on, and the country mostly operates as normal. Not even remotely comparable.\n\nMore like The Superbowl is like Labor Day. And I KNOW no one would be throwing a tantrum over a Labor Day Birthday party", "Lol Christmas is an actual holiday. Supebowl is nowhere near the level of Christmas. Apples and oranges.", "My birthday falls on labor day wknd I def had childhood tantrums over it", "The country looses 3.5 billion dollars in productivity tge day after.  I would not call it a normal day.", "I said the country still operates as normal. Businesses don't close down. Stores and restaurants are still open. Most people still go to work and school. You typically don't get Holiday Pay for working it. \n\nIt's not anywhere *near* Christmas."]}
