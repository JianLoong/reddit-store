I know there is an hour and a half in between, but I'm thinking about people who are hosting their own super bowl parties that will need that time to get ready.", "INFO: is Feb 12 your son's actual birthday?", "Yes my bday always fell on Super Bowl Sunday and my mom would throw parties and no one ever came. Ever, empty pizza place,empty gymnastics rental,empty lazer tag, empty arcade. You should reschedule. Adults love any excuse to sit and drink nonstop and watch sports.", "NAH\n\nSo long as you don't get fussed about people not coming or leaving early.", "You can have the party when you want.\n\nHowever, people may not come. I have friends that make a big deal about the Super Bowl.

It\u2019s not just about when the game starts. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call you an AH, yet. That is dependent on how you will react if people don\u2019t come to your sons party?\nYou\u2019ve picked a day a lot of people are likely to have other other plans.  Providing you are fine with the party being smaller due to that, go forth, you do you. If it\u2019s going to upset you that people dint come because they have plans to have a get together with friends that day for the superbowl, well, the Super Bowl isn\u2019t going to move, whereas your party can.", "NAH, but you might try to have it another day anyway, to keep things easy.  (For a lot of people, the Superbowl is an all-day event.)  At 3, the child's probably not old enough to care about it being on the actual day, and would rather have all their grandparents there.", "NAH\n\nBut you have got to know that people have to get ready and they start their Super Bowl parties well before kick off. It is kind of inconsiderate because it puts people in a hard place. I'm not even a football fan, but I understand the Super Bowl is a big deal, no matter what teams are playing.", "People need time to cook and clean up their house before their own super bowl party and 1.5 hours generally speaking is not enough time to do that in. You have your party, but realize that others probably wont be there. You arent an asshole unless you start berating people and making them choose. Then you would be.

If that was his actual birthday and you were simply insisting that he be allowed to celebrate his birthday on his actual day, I\u2019d agree with you 100%. But it\u2019s not, and as you\u2019ve said,  you *chose* Super Bowl Sunday, because \u201cit works better for your families to have parties on Sundays\u201d. Except that it clearly doesn\u2019t, at least not this particular Sunday, and I don\u2019t think your husband\u2019s father is being unreasonable. Again, if it were the actual birthday I\u2019d agree that the kid\u2019s day is way more important than football, but it\u2019s not- you\u2019ve set up this weird awkward situation that\u2019s just completely unnecessary. I\u2019m not that into football either but I understand it\u2019s like a holiday for a lot of people, and while you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t hold it against people who don\u2019t come you also say that *your husband and his father are already fighting over it*. YTA for inaccurately describing the issue at hand and for choosing to schedule a three-year-old\u2019s birthday party on a day you knew would be problematic and lead to friction within your husband\u2019s family.", "YTA just do saturday no conflict.", "NTA, both are nonsense engagements anyone could miss, and not be bothered. What does it matter?", "Soft YTA. Because people have probably already made plans, and especially people who have kids will feel torn between taking their kid or hosting something for the Super Bowl if they\u2019ve already planned something. \n\nAnd the phrase \u201cit\u2019s ok for some people not to come\u201d is a guilt trip and my hunch is, you probably already know that. Because if you threw a fit about it, you\u2019re making it an easy decision for them not to go to your thing.", "Kind of YTA , but not in a terrible way. I think it\u2019s inconsiderate to schedule something on days where you know many of the people coming will have plans making attending your party either not possible  or very inconvenient. While only a few have openly expressed concern, I\u2019d be willing to bet there are others who don\u2019t appreciate the timing.", "YTA. You just don't do birthday parties on big things like that. An hour and a half may seem like a lot but if people want to have things prepared at home, etc it's not much when travel is factored in. Should have thought of timing quite a while ago. Or made it earlier. That is a long time for a kids party. Goodness. \n\nAt least you say you won't be upset if people skip it.", "Assuming this is the US, YTA. The Super Bowl is an almost holiday-like social event, even for many of those not into football.  From the parties, to the commercials, to the half time show, its what people will be talking about for a week, and will be planning around all day that Sunday.\n\nYou KNOW FROM THE START it will conflict with schedules and rub people the wrong way.  None of this is a surprise.  And you have this \"family first\" moral high ground hanging over everything making things worse.  And there are people who genuinely might like to go to both, but now have to put one over the other. \n\nToo oblivious on your part.  YTA.", "Yta look, I regularly call it The Stupid Bowl and watch the puppy bowl.  But to many, many people it's a big freaken deal.  It's also a date that is set waaaaaay in advance so  a quick Google would have told you the date.", "NAH. You scheduled the party fine, but some people have their own game day events that they want time to prepare for. Some people take the Super Bowl very seriously after all.", "YTA - it's a very selfish, \"my child or your own interests\" kind of attitude.  People who are avid football fans live for this day.  They live for this party.  They either want to host their own party or attend someone else's.  They don't want to eat birthday cake, sing songs, fill up on food and then head to the party they wanted to really attend.  Why not have it the day before?  Your stubbornness just seems selfish and thoughtless.", "YTA. You\u2019ve scheduled a 3-yr-old\u2019s party on a day that is not your son\u2019s birthday but *is* a huge party day for a lot of people, including your husband\u2019s family (the child\u2019s grandparents). Your reasoning for this is that \u201cSundays work better for our family\u201d but go on to explain that your husband\u2019s parents are terrible people for not wanting to exchange Super Bowl Sunday for a child\u2019s birthday party. You seem to lack both rational thinking skills as well as an ability to see more than one side of a pretty simple situation. You should reconsider the party- maybe have it on his birthday since it\u2019s the day before- if it\u2019s not too late.", "YTA. Why wouldn't you have the party on a Saturday? Like a normal birthday party...", "YTA. The Super Bowl is important to a lot of people, including some of your family members, and all in is more involved than just turning the game on.\n\nAt the same time, family members will put their 3 year old relative ahead of the Super Bowl anyway, so you're inconveniencing them.\n\nIf this isn't excessively difficult to change, you should.", "Yta. You have plenty of time change the date to Saturday still.", "Honest. Yta.", " I hope my Eagles (from Phila area) are in but I actually enjoy the party the squares, the food, the commercials and halftime more than the game lol.  Would give a child\u2019s b-day party even though relative a nod but wouldn\u2019t be too happy about it.  Would be muttering about why not pick a different day etc.  YTA", "My middle child was born during the Super Bowl half time show 8 years ago. My bday is right after the possible date to fall on Sunday, and my sisters birthday is during the possible dates. So 3 people in my family have had to postpone our bday weekend because of the Superbowl, but then the following week is Valentines Day. \n\nIt sucks, but we coordinate so it\u2019s not interfering, so that we don\u2019t end up with no one at our party.

If only there was a way I could invite them but they wouldn't come...\n\nYTA if you knew others would want to watch the game. It's not a big deal to you but if it is to them why make them choose between their grandson and the game. Yes, there's a time gap but most people have their own gatherings and food.

Maybe he\u2019ll love football and won\u2019t mind sharing his birthday as he grows up, but it\u2019s still nice to have a birthday where everyone isn\u2019t distracted and talking about the big game, even if it is earlier in the day.", "Why not one day early on Saturday?

As stated in another comment, I know many people who celebrate their birthdays on Christmas and have a joint party/gathering.

As stated in their edits, OP even compromised and moved the time of the party. \n\nHave you given any thought that OP chose Feb. 12th because that was the day that worked best for their family (partner and themself)? So, while the date may be an inconvenience, if people view the Super Bowl as more important, that\u2019s fine and OP is okay with that.

I wasn\u2019t talking about it being religious or cultural. \n\nIn case you didn\u2019t read it in my original comment, NAH. Because again, OP isn\u2019t holding it against anyone that shows up. Sending out an invitation does not make you an asshole, especially if you\u2019re expecting (and are okay with) some people not being able to come. As you said, some people care more about the Super Bowl than Christmas, great! From what we know, only two of the people (out of however many were invited) are upset about the date. OP also compromised a bit and moved the party back (which I\u2019m guessing means starting it earlier/ending it earlier).  So it doesn\u2019t make them an asshole.\n\nYou could also raise the question that why is a football game more important than a grandchild\u2019s birthday party? The argument could be made for both sides that the events happen every year, so what would their reasonings be?", "Just furthering the technicality, there are soccer games that are \"bigger\" than the Superbowl outside the US that happen annually (CL Finals for sure, any meaningful el Clasicos as well)", "If you looked at her comments then you should know that Sunday isn't even the kids birthday\n\nOn top of that the date for the super bowl was announced a well ahead of time if I'm not mistaken and some people are even claiming the date for next years has already been set\n\nMy main question is why she making such a gigantic deal out of this birthday party in the first place to the point of inviting 30 people the kid is 3 years old could you not just host it sometime I am after work during the week or friends and family who want to come", "No, it's the day after the kid's birthday, a day that works best for everyone but the ILs.\n\nTbh, the pearl-clutching and acting like OP has violated a High Holy Day is fucking weird, man. It's a game - the season finale, yes, but even so. It's a game that precisely nobody in the OP or the entire comment section will have any effect on. No one here or in OP's circle is playing in it. Of the people who DO watch it, the vast majority probably won't even remember who played in a few years. \n\nSo, if this party is at a time that works for everyone else (it is), and OP has made concessions so that people can make it in time to watch the game (she has), and she's not actively harming anyone by throwing a party (remains to be seen - could be a real rager /s), then I'm not going to begrudge her. The kid probably won't remember, either, but OP and her husband will.\n\nConclusion: football fans are pushy AF and think their favorite show is the most important thing in the world."]}
