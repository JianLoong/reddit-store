I told my dad to spend the time with his sister instead who isn\u2019t too far and he agreed he would. With that term I agreed to house him for a part of his trip but on the condition he also respects my mental health and does not trigger it. \n\nWell I ended up having one of the biggest panic attacks of my life after a long time of not having one. At the end of my dads trip I told him I would likely not do it again cause of how traumatic it was. He said he was hurt but understood and next time he could stay with his sister as this time he rarely did. \n\nNow early 2023. My dad sends me his itinerary with a stay of 5 weeks long. I didn\u2019t know he was coming. So I asked who he plans to stay with and if he had talked to his sister. He said he hasn\u2019t and wants to stay with me again. \n\nI pretty much repeat what I told him the last time about how it\u2019s too much for me mentally and to ask his other daughter if he wants to stay with one of his girls. He refuses again cause she lives with her fianc\u00e9. He said that when I have a bf he would respect me not helping. \n\nWell shortly after I get into a relationship. The guy doesn\u2019t live with me full time but is in my place a lot. I told my dad that I now can\u2019t take him based on what he said before. He then tries to push me cause my bf doesn\u2019t live there full time and that now his trip is a waste as he won\u2019t see his girls. I said that\u2019s not true that he has another daughter with more space that can help but doesn\u2019t want to. I did offer all my weekends and all my work from home days to go to his sister or my sisters to spend time with him but that wasn\u2019t good enough for him.\n\nI stood firm and got a text yesterday from him in the group chat with my sister. He says he is cancelling his trip cause he won\u2019t be able to spend the time with his girls and that he will just come next year instead. I said  I am sad he isn\u2019t coming, but coming next year won\u2019t solve the issue as I don\u2019t plan on moving to a bigger place, I have my bf and my mental health probably won\u2019t change; so I told him he would still have to stay with his sister. My sister tells me I\u2019m rude to which I told her if she wasn\u2019t happy with the outcome to open her doors.

But when you are a parent I was under the impression that your child\u2019s happiness and well-being comes before yours.", "Thank you for that advice and the kind words. \n\nHonestly I am not going to reach back out and suggest anything more, he knows where I stand. \n\nHe will just push until he somehow breaks me down through guilt trip so I\u2019m not even going to give him that chance.", "Quit bargaining with him. Straight out say NO and he done, your not the ass!", "NTA. You are not your dads vacation plan. Protect your mental health. \n\nHugs.", "YTA - this is your dad!\nHe raised you, fed you, provided security and shelter through your childhood. What is 4 weeks or 5 weeks?\nSeriously - he is your family, bonded by blood. I don't know how to say it in any other way.\nRespect him, take care of him, love him", "I\u2019m done talking and explaining. We on to radio silence now \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "Thank you. Hugs right back :)", "Yeah I think you are missing the part where he left me at the age of 12 because he wasn\u2019t happy in Canada. When you have a parent your child\u2019s needs come first not your own. \n\nAlso my parent divorced at a young age so he didn\u2019t raise me, he hardly knows who I am as person. \n\nAlso he wasn\u2019t generous with child support so I didn\u2019t have much security in the area I lived growing up. In fact there was lots of crime. \n\nAlso BPD is a diagnosis that stems from childhood trauma and abandonment. This man has traumatized me to the point of having a mental health diagnosis that is hard to treat and rarely can be overcome because he couldn\u2019t meet my needs as child. \n\nAlso I think you are missing the part where he has another daughter and his own sister who don\u2019t have mental health trauma from him to the degree to which I do. \n\nRespect is earned not given. And if cant respect my boundaries, he can\u2019t respect me. And in that case why respect him?\n\nI really hope you aren\u2019t a parent yourself because if this what you expect from a child you literally traumatized then you are pretty entitled.", "Don't be too presumptuous that he won't just show up on your doorstep as a \"surprise\". I decided to come after all, or just show up next year so you can't say no.", "I don\u2019t think he would. But I am ready to drive him back to the airport or his sisters.", "Good for you! \n\nIf your dad and/sister start up again remember that you\u2019re NTA for your boundaries. And use the block button to keep your own peace if needed. \n\nBest of luck!", "Thank you for the tip that is definitely what I will do if it continues on."]}
