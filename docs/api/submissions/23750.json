Earlier today, Tim texted me telling me to meet him at our condo (the home we're moving out of) over his lunch break. (The place we're moving to is about 45 minutes away.) Tim then said he had to be quick as he had a 1pm meeting. We met at the condo at 12 and that's when he told me he needed me to stay there until he got off work at 6pm. I told him I could not as I'd only packed 1 bottle and light snacks for the baby, needed to go grocery shopping and he knew I needed to be at the new house because internet was due to be installed today. \n\nTim got angry and said that common sense, especially when we're moving should have told me I needed to stick around. That I'm being stupid by wasting gas, I drive an SUV, and he had planned to pack the back of it full. I told him that he'd never mentioned to me that he needed me to stay, and his lack of communication is not my fault. Plus he already new I needed to go grocery shopping and meet the internet guy at the new place. He spent the rest of the afternoon texting me how I'm lazy and irresponsible for not staying at the condo, that he could have put a lot in my SUV and it's unfair he's trying to fit so much in his car. I kept reiterating that his lack of communication is not my fault. Tim called me petty and told me to grow up and actually think things through.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Tim and I didn't swap cars because I have a very hard time getting the infant carrier in and out of his coupe.

NTA btw.", "NTA.  Start reading narcwise.com. Its eyeopening when  you learn  your spouse is indeed a narcissist. Yours fits the pattern. Its the best step toward saving you  & your kids a lot of un-needed heartbreak & self doubt.", "Oh hey, my dad is like that too! Arguing with those people over anything is a lost cause. From experience, I can guarantee you that he angrily mutters about it at work, and will do so throughout the week too.\n\nJust as I can assume from experience that he angrily mutters about work at home. People like that are so incredibly exhausting to deal with, it's a struggle every day to not lash out against them when they make everything your fault amd talk down to you constantly.", "Why are you with him at all? Does he have any redeeming qualities that aren't 'well he's nice the other 30% of the time!'", "Sounds like my step father. I hate him. I hated living with him. His own son hates him. He blamed everyone for nor reading his mind, now that I'm older and independent he respects me kind of. Please divorce this man, my mom didn't and her two kids have really bad people pleasing trauma, hate confrontation and are afraid of disagreeing. This got me in bad relationships, crazy partying and shit like that. Divorce him!", "He wanted you to do absolutely nothing in an empty condo for 5 hours with small children? No. That's a power play, not a reasonable request.

I thought it was car seats/ anchors for infant car seats. I figured once the base was swapped, she could easily get the baby (in a carrier) out of the car at the destination. \n\nHer not being able to get the baby out of one of their cars makes it harder to swap than I realized.", "NTA", "NTA. Why are you with this guy?", "NTA. Who the fuck does your husband think he's speaking to? You're his *wife*, not some random arsehole on the street. A pathetic 'man'", "Tim can suck rocks. \n\nHe\u2019s a HUGE AH. \n\nHuge. \n\nHe called you: stupid, lazy, wasteful, irresponsible, petty, in need of growing up, and don\u2019t think things through\u2026.\n\nSays the man who expects a wife to spend SIX HOURS at the condo when he knows the internet guy is scheduled at the new house and the family needs food. Says the guy who texts his wife to complain and whine and say mean things all afternoon. \n\nSays the guy who\u2019s wife has EDS and is recovering from a dislocated shoulder and clavicle. And has a baby and another child to watch. But yeah, she\u2019s the lazy one. My eyes just rolled so far in they\u2019re stuck. \n\nNTA \n\nYou sure you want to buy a house with this guy?", "Ugh my husband does this crap too serially so men think we r freaking magic? Like we had mind reading abilities? If u need something from me just tell me if it\u2019s something I can manage of corse but if I have other things I need to do I\u2019m sry but I can he sounds like a bully and the way he\u2019s speaking to u is not ok", "I still don\u2019t understand why he needed you at the condo all day? He wanted you to pack?", "NTA but your husband is one\n\nIm also a suspicious one. Did your husband need to know exactly where you were for the afternoon instead of you grocery shopping and heaven knows what else?\n\nHe's controlling and abusive.", "NTA he seems to expect you to be a mind reader which you are not. No one is. You have your own stuff to worry about and he can't expect you to pick up the slack for his lack of communication skills. Actually he can expect it, but that may indicate a level of dickishness on his part.", "NTA how are someone else's plans common sense?", "Unfortunately, from OP's other comments, it seems like this is just a regular Wednesday because hubby is actually a giant festering pustule wearing a human suit. I could be wrong though....", "Excuse you, but I certainly do my fair share of moving stuff. I can't go as fast or lift as much weight as Tim, but I did packed all his clothes, my clothes, the kids clothes, toiletries, toys, kitchen stuff and home decor.

I've never thought about it in those terms before but you are so correct", "I knew what you needed to do, I don't understand what he was expecting you to do while you sat around there until 6pm since he was upset when you told him you couldn't stay since you needed to be home for internet and shopping. And I don't understand what he wanted you to do with him at noon during his lunch break.", "The problem was that OP's husband is a narcissistic abuser and fully expected to demand she drop everything and rearrange her entire day at his whim, because being able to make unreasonable demands and force her to cancel plans and inconvenience herself and their kids for his sake makes him feel powerful and he's essentially addicted to that feeling. He was trying go on a power trip and she denied him that high, so he got mad.\n\nThis guy is red flag city and if OP loves her kids at all, she needs to work on removing them from this environment. My dad was like this guy and it's really not a healthy way to grow up.", "He wanted me and the kids to eat lunch with him and drop off some tools.", "That\u2019s not what I would advise you to do for a prompt recovery. Honestly you seem to have as much body issues as elderly people.\n\nI wish moving was as easy as packing clothes.", "Moving can cause unusual stress and related bad behaviour. I wonder if the verbal abuse is permanent or if it\u2019s a single instance.\n\nEither way the moving was planned really bad on both parts. Sounds like it will be a learning experience for both of them.", "I've never been diagnosed,  just been told by numerous doctors that I've got hypermobile joints.

He doesn't get I deal with chronic pain, pots, mcas, anxiety, depression and ptsd no matter how much I explain it. Feels like if I just put it out of my mind it should all go away.", "He didn't want me to waste gas in the SUV. New place is 45 minutes from the condo, so once I went grocery shopping and dealt with internet install and drove back it would be an hour and half of driving. Tim wanted me to cancel internet install for the day and wait for him at condo then go grocery shopping at night.", "That part, I have no idea. I still don't understand why he wanted me to sit with a 9yo and 8 month old in an almost empty condo for several hours", "You're an ass and obviously haven't read OPs comments. YOU DON'T \"RECOVER\" FROM A CHRONIC ILLNESS. You're a condescending moron. Get fucked.", "My husband is very much the type to say, pop an advil and go do something, don't be useless and put everything on me, if you can't use one arm, use the other one, times wasting here", "Doesn\u2019t matter. If someone becomes abusive because they\u2019re stressed , they\u2019re still being abusive.", "Yes, EDS. I swear at this point most of my ribs are permanently out of place.

This is the man you want raising your children and modelling masculinity and relationships? I get that leaving is often easier said than done, but my heart breaks for you and your children.", "I think it's time to find resources to leave.", "many of the issues you describe are passed down thru families, how do you think he'll treat y'all's kid if she gets sick when he treats you this badly? it'd probably traumatize her to be treated like that and you know that's exactly how he'll treat her. what happens when she gets injured or ill and he refuses to take her to the doctor or the hospital bc he thinks she's just a lazy liar? what happens if you need medical attention desperately and he won't help you get it?", "Listen. Seriously, please listen. Drag him to therapy, and have a therapist listen to his arguments about all this stuff. Explain to the therapist what happened with you not reading his mind about staying at the condo. Lay it all out exactly like you have here. And see what the therapist says. Because I can bet real money, that therapist is gonna tell you what I'm telling you now. He is manipulating you, and if this is his normal behaviour, he is emotionally/psychologically abusive. None of this is ok. He is either a literal child mentally, or perhaps even a narcissist? I know people throw that word around a lot, but this is all classic narcissist behaviour/beliefs. Have your husband explain his side to the therapist and watch as he storms out/refuses to return because the therapist isn't validating his side of the argument. If the therapist is worth their salt, they will challenge him, and he will throw a tantrum about it. You can bet on that.", "Oh, honey, please please consider how you want the rest of your life to go. You don't have a cold, you have a serious disease that affects every part of your life! Will he be a support, or a hindrance as you get older? What if one of your kids has EDS? Will you let him downplay it then?", "I think you need to at least consider the possibility that he did this for no other reason than to inconvenience you, fuck up your plans and your ability to control your own day, and fuck with your head.\n\nThis is a thing abusers do. They do it a lot.", "I\u2019m having new informations right now about the situation so my mind is fluid and actively changing along the way.", "Sounds like everything is badly planned. Next time you both should hire movers or rent a truck to reduce the stress level your husband is not handling well.", "He feels it\u2019s unfair to move stuff after work at 6pm by himself with little help. Sounds like he has valid human emotions instead of being dead inside like a serial killer. Only a Reddit user would jump to conclusion that stress can always be controlled. Humans can act poorly and it\u2019s how they learn after their actions that\u2019s important. So it\u2019s VERY important that it\u2019s not permanent abuse.", "I have watched this give my stepmom problems for 30+ plus years. My dad is a saint for how lovingly he has always cared for her. I have so much compassion for you!! \n\nWhich your husband *does NOT*, and I am furious on your behalf.", "You owe OP an apology for being so crass and absolutely judgemental. Smh", "Username DOES NOT checkout.", "You\u2019re honestly just not smart enough to engage with any further. Bye. Connard grossier.", "It\u2019s a fact that she\u2019s recovering from shoulder dislocation so your comment isn\u2019t valid. Try being less emotional and more open to conversation. Being riled up won\u2019t get you any good conversation. Look at your behaviour", "Well if my speech isn\u2019t fantastic it\u2019s because my birth language is French.", "We\u2019ll se if you ever have to move stuff from one house to the other with an handicapped partner how pretty it\u2019ll be. It\u2019s already huge with a functioning partner.", "Honestly you seem to have as many stupidity issues as stupid people.", "It\u2019s a fact her EDS means she\u2019ll deal with things like dislocations for the rest of her life. You owe OP an apology for your bullshit statements.", "Leave me the fuck alone you abuse apologist.", "I wonder if you have any idea what being stupid is. Being stupid is doing actions that don\u2019t advantage you AND others. Being a bandit is doing actions that advantage you but disadvantage others. One could be ignorant but everybody is ignorant in some way unless they have a big ego if you know what I mean. In this particular case I see the husband having to move stuff from one home to the other can be stressful so he acts out just like you do right now. Sounds like you have similar personality traits. The best version of her husband would manage his emotions and stress. So the best solution to this is either renting a truck, planning better or hiring movers. Guess what? That would be intelligent but it was done how? Stupidly\n\nI wonder how many writing mistake I make. Excuse my French.", "Tell me more about my stupidity issues that you see in me and other people?", "Eds doesn\u2019t mean anything to me since my birth language is French so I overlooked it. Still, without him moving the stuff (after work on top of it) she would be stuck. She owes him a little patience for his stress related offenses, right?", "That\u2019s foul language for someone that wants to argue about morality.", "Oh, you're still on about this?? Get over it. Have a good night!!", "You could have looked up what EDS means since OP gave the full name of her condition. No, she does not owe the abusive bastard a little patience. YOU owe OP an apology.", "Leave me the fuck alone you disgusting abuse apologist. Foul language isn\u2019t immoral and you\u2019re still a disgusting abuse apologist."]}
