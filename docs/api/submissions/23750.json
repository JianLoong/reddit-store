Earlier today, Tim texted me telling me to meet him at our condo (the home we're moving out of) over his lunch break. (The place we're moving to is about 45 minutes away.) Tim then said he had to be quick as he had a 1pm meeting. We met at the condo at 12 and that's when he told me he needed me to stay there until he got off work at 6pm. I told him I could not as I'd only packed 1 bottle and light snacks for the baby, needed to go grocery shopping and he knew I needed to be at the new house because internet was due to be installed today. \n\nTim got angry and said that common sense, especially when we're moving should have told me I needed to stick around. That I'm being stupid by wasting gas, I drive an SUV, and he had planned to pack the back of it full. I told him that he'd never mentioned to me that he needed me to stay, and his lack of communication is not my fault. Plus he already new I needed to go grocery shopping and meet the internet guy at the new place. He spent the rest of the afternoon texting me how I'm lazy and irresponsible for not staying at the condo, that he could have put a lot in my SUV and it's unfair he's trying to fit so much in his car. I kept reiterating that his lack of communication is not my fault. Tim called me petty and told me to grow up and actually think things through.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Tim and I didn't swap cars because I have a very hard time getting the infant carrier in and out of his coupe.

He says bad things but she\u2019s handicapped and certainly not helping.", "I hire movers much much easier", "So are you waiting for him to start hitting you or what?", "Cool cool cool, is he always like this?  And by \"like this\" I do very much\nmean verbally abusive.", "Why are you putting up with this ridiculous behaviour? I'm not saying dump him, but I am saying you need to let him know this is unacceptable and that changes need to be made.", "Soooooo\u2026why are you with him if he treats you like you\u2019re an idiot and can\u2019t take accountability for his own actions? NTA btw.", "NTA.  Start reading narcwise.com. Its eyeopening when  you learn  your spouse is indeed a narcissist. Yours fits the pattern. Its the best step toward saving you  & your kids a lot of un-needed heartbreak & self doubt.", "Oh hey, my dad is like that too! Arguing with those people over anything is a lost cause. From experience, I can guarantee you that he angrily mutters about it at work, and will do so throughout the week too.\n\nJust as I can assume from experience that he angrily mutters about work at home. People like that are so incredibly exhausting to deal with, it's a struggle every day to not lash out against them when they make everything your fault amd talk down to you constantly.", "Why are you with him at all? Does he have any redeeming qualities that aren't 'well he's nice the other 30% of the time!'", "Sounds like my step father. I hate him. I hated living with him. His own son hates him. He blamed everyone for nor reading his mind, now that I'm older and independent he respects me kind of. Please divorce this man, my mom didn't and her two kids have really bad people pleasing trauma, hate confrontation and are afraid of disagreeing. This got me in bad relationships, crazy partying and shit like that. Divorce him!", "He wanted you to do absolutely nothing in an empty condo for 5 hours with small children? No. That's a power play, not a reasonable request. There is no reason on the planet that you couldn't have done the shopping, met with the internet guy, and then meet your husband after work.", "Your husband is not only abusive but he\u2019s kind of a dumbass", "\u2026.why", "Dislocated shoulder and clavicle are most likely from EDS, btw. My stepmom has it, and she dislocated key joints *while sitting down*. It's horrific. \n\nWouldn't it be great if the husband moved car seats for her, though?", "I second this comment.", "Worse: he decides ones perfect & ones the outsider", "She told him the night before about her plans for the day. Grocery shopping and being at new place for internet hookup. He\u2019s an a$$. She\u2019s not", "She\u2019d still have to do it when she got where she was going though.", "I came for the posts i stayed for the other pov clapback posts", "Oops! I thought it was car seats/ anchors for infant car seats. I figured once the base was swapped, she could easily get the baby (in a carrier) out of the car at the destination. \n\nHer not being able to get the baby out of one of their cars makes it harder to swap than I realized."]}
