Earlier today, Tim texted me telling me to meet him at our condo (the home we're moving out of) over his lunch break. (The place we're moving to is about 45 minutes away.) Tim then said he had to be quick as he had a 1pm meeting. We met at the condo at 12 and that's when he told me he needed me to stay there until he got off work at 6pm. I told him I could not as I'd only packed 1 bottle and light snacks for the baby, needed to go grocery shopping and he knew I needed to be at the new house because internet was due to be installed today. \n\nTim got angry and said that common sense, especially when we're moving should have told me I needed to stick around. That I'm being stupid by wasting gas, I drive an SUV, and he had planned to pack the back of it full. I told him that he'd never mentioned to me that he needed me to stay, and his lack of communication is not my fault. Plus he already new I needed to go grocery shopping and meet the internet guy at the new place. He spent the rest of the afternoon texting me how I'm lazy and irresponsible for not staying at the condo, that he could have put a lot in my SUV and it's unfair he's trying to fit so much in his car. I kept reiterating that his lack of communication is not my fault. Tim called me petty and told me to grow up and actually think things through.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Tim and I didn't swap cars because I have a very hard time getting the infant carrier in and out of his coupe.

There's loads of information online about living with narcissists. Check Dr Ramani, she's ace. I hope that things will go well for you and your child.", "Your husband is an abusive narcissist. Reading through the comments and seeing this is a pattern for him confirmed it for me.\n\nSource: This is exactly like daily life with my ex.\n\nIt doesn't get better. Trust me.", "Yta.", "you dont need to worry, youre innocent. you dO need to worry about what a nob your husband is.", "Wouldn't it be lazyer(?) If she stayed there and didn't get shit done?", "You do realize men can be abusive AND move heavy objects, right? The two are not mutually exclusive.", "Lazier. \ud83d\ude42", "I\u2019m sorry you have children with this man.", "I was willing to cut him a little slack because moving his hellish and everyone is stressed out of their minds, but if this is just how he always is, ew. NTA. I hope he has some good qualities.", "Why are you with him?", "he sounds so sad", "Did you bring the lunch?", "The issue is likely not the moving of seats, but one of the kids is still in an infant seat.... The kind you take out of the car every ride and carry the kid around in. \n(Just FWIW.)\n\nAnd yes, EDS is awful.\nAnd exhausting! Which makes the whole thing even weirder!", "And you decided he\u2019d make a great life partner because\u2026", "> I just put it out of my mind it should all go away.\n\nMaybe you should put him out of your life and make him go away.", "I know Reddit goes to \u2018break up\u2019 quickly but honestly, why are you with this dude?", "From one chronically ill woman to another, why are you with him?\n\n\nYou and I both know that your conditions are real and that wishing they weren't doesn't make it so. It is abusive and harmful for your husband to stubbornly refuse to acknowledge the lived reality of your daily life and the limitations of your body.\n\n\nI know it is scary to be alone, especially when children are involved, but this is no way to live my love. You shouldn't do this to yourself. You need to love yourself enough to leave this relationship, I'm sorry but it's true. Staying with this man will disable you further and could very well drive you to an early grave, as well as modelling horrendous behaviours for your children both in your husbands abuse and in your willingness to endure the abuse.\n\n\nIf you are strong enough to live with EDS, mcas, pots, ptsd, anxiety, depression, etc. Then you are strong enough to be a single parent and walk away from this awful man. I am saying this with all the love and compassion in my heart. Please do not stay.", "He should've taken lunch with him to the condo....", "Does he love you", "I can not for the life of me understand why people have children which partners who treat them like this."]}
