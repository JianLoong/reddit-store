You the MVP.", "NTA.

Sometimes you gotta stand up for what's right. If that means ruffling a few feathers, so be it!", "NTA\n\nIf you\u2019re not using the equipment you shouldn\u2019t be on it taking up space. Everyone deserves equal opportunity to USE the machines at the gym. You wouldn\u2019t throw your sweatshirt on a machine to hold it while you chat with a friend, so don\u2019t park your ass on it to chat either.\n\nMy gym has a strict no sitting and texting on machines policy, same should go for sitting and chatting. It\u2019s just plain rude to hog equipment when other people are waiting on your machine. Everyone should be expected to politely finish their sets, wipe down equipment, and move on.", "NTA.
