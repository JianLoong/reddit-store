And it\u2019s the sort of thing that happens all the time.\n\nThe amount of cluelessness around gym etiquette is astounding and getting worse. \n\nThe bottom line in this case is that if you\u2019re in the gym and it\u2019s busy and/or you\u2019re occupying a piece of equipment and either not using it or using it for some purpose that can be done somewhere else, then get off of that piece of equipment so someone else can use it.\n\nFor example, we have two incline bench press racks at our gym. One was being used by a guy doing incline bench press. Cool. The other one was being used by a guy standing on the spotter\u2019s platform and using the barbell as a brace on which to perform bicep DB curls. \n\nThere were at least five other unoccupied stations at the gym at that moment, which would have allowed the guy to perform that very exercise including two preacher curl racks. Instead, he used the one remaining incline bench press, preventing anyone who wanted to do incline press from doing incline press.\n\nAnother example I just witnessed was on a busy Saturday morning. The gym was packed. A guy took up three separate benches/machines for 40 minutes to perform his circuit. He would stick a towel through the handle on the adjustable elevation swing-arm fly machine, his water bottle on the cable row machine, and then another towel on a flat bench. He would then rotate through his three stations. His full rotation took about ten minutes. He did it four times. He even took a couple of trips to the bathroom during the 40 minutes he occupied all three. Every other fly machine, flat bench, and cable row machine was taken during the 40 minutes he occupied all three.\n\nAnother recent incident: we have a fake grass carpet \u201crunway\u201d in our gym for people to perform sprints or pull the weighted sled and similar. Bewilderingly, the gym installed \u201cland mines\u201d right next to the runway. If one of them is being used, it cuts off about a third of the carpet runway. Young kid with his two girlfriends starts using the land mine while girlfriends set up next to him doing DB work. He and his girlfriends had the option of setting up on one side of the land mine so that they only cut off one third of the runway, or on the other side, so that they cut off about half of the runway. They set up on the side of the land mine that left only half of the runway useable.\n\nI wanted to use the sled and wanted as much runway as possible. So, I asked the guys\u2019 girlfriends if they could please move to the other side of the land mine, thereby freeing up runway space. They did. I then did a down and back on the  two thirds of the runway that were now open with the sled. \n\nAfter finishing, the guy confronted me. He said it was rude to ask them to move. I replied that I didn\u2019t think so. It was an easy request that only required them to pick up their 20-lb DB\u2019s and move to the empty portion of runway on the other side of the land mine. They were in between sets when I made my request. It got ugly and the guy ended up threatening me. I filed a police report. It seemed like an easy and no-big-ask request for something they should have done to begin with (though I can understand not thinking of it when they first set up).\n\nAnyway, IMO, people ought to have to watch a video on gym etiquette or pass a test on it or something before being allowed to work out at a gym. Bad gym etiquette is rampant and getting worse. \n\nI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a function of \u201ckids these days\u201d or whatever (the guy taking up the three stations was at least in his 60\u2019s), but man, I don\u2019t remember bad gym etiquette being this bad 15 or 20 years ago.

Leg press seems to be their favourite hangout in my experience. \n\nYou've done a good thing if she's less selfish in the future.", "i keep my sweet little pretty mouth shut, do my reps, keep my eyes to my dang self, and GTFO.\nif i wanted to play hero on the stuff i c @ the gym, oo wee", "NTA- yeah it wasn\u2019t your business but you saw something that was wrong and stood up and said no. We need more people like this and good on you! Society tends to ignore these people and that let\u2019s them think they can do whatever they want. Some people need reality checks and someone\u2019s gotta be the one to give it to them. Today it was you.", "as a gym rat that'd probably get pepper sprayed for doing that, thank you hahaha NTA", "NTA!!! People like yourself make me feel more comfortable at the gym in all honesty!", "NTA. I call this gym-ettiquete \"If you see something, say something\" unwritten rule.", "NTA. I once sat behind someone who sat through an entire green light without driving, ignoring the irritated honks of others she was holding up. \n\nI wonder if they are related. It is rude to intentionally inconvenience others like this. Maybe being called out will teach her some shame.", "meh...YTA...but only for your delivery.  This behavior is annoying, and something should have been said. I don't think it matters that you didn't know the other girl. \n\nYou let your annoyance build and you went a little overboard with your language.  You probably should have asked the gym to post clear rules for use (or non-use) of the machines.", "Why would someone even do that? Gym equipment is the least comfortable place to sit, except maybe a crumbling asphalt curb. I work out solo with a trainer and even when he tells me to relax after a set, I\u2019m jumping off the machine because it\u2019s so heinously uncomfortable when I\u2019m not actually working.\n\nI bet OP\u2019s nemesis also leaves her laundry in commercial machines, stands in public doorways while checking her FB, parks her cart in the middle of the aisle, sits halfway through a green light while checking her makeup and in all other ways is the kind of menace who makes public spaces impractical.", "And before you sit down at a machine she's using, soak your shirt so it looks like you sweat a lot", "I hope it inspired onlookers to speak up. I know that anxiety about making others mad. Seeing someone assert themselves without the world ending can be really helpful.", "Not at the Y!!!", "NTA I like to think I would have done the same thing", "NTA. We live in a society with a social contract. Thank you for speaking up for the shy girl after the lady steamrolled her. If she wants to sit and chat with her friends they should do so over coffee or in the locker room.", "Just wanted to say, I appreciate people like you, I really do. NTA", "I haven\u2019t gone to the gym in 2 months because I moved but this last year when I was going there\u2019s always be people on the incline and decline presses (criminally) that would always be on their phones for 20+ minutes. Anytime I saw that I would just walk up to them ask em how many sets they got left and if they get huffy I just say \u201ccool I\u2019ll wait\u201d and stand next to the machine they\u2019re on and they tend to hurry up a little bit", "NTA. Use it or lose it. Either come to work out or stay on the sides and talk. Don't do both. You did the right thing. Being the gym mom is a hard choice but you were awesome.", "based gym chad", "You are NTA.\n\nWell done!\n\nThe gym rat who uses the gym as an excuse to chat while idling on a machine, is.", "NTA!!!!", "Gyms need more \"no camping\" signs.  Everyone needs a cool down, but if you're able to chat, then you're cooled down enough usually.", "Why are so many people concerned about being \"rude\" to rude people? They need a taste of their own medicine.", "Florida Man over here bringing the heat \ud83d\ude02 I would expect no less. \ud83d\udc96", "At worst esh fits better", "I think the gym owners would prefer people that don't use the equipment because it puts less wear on them.", "ESH - you did embarrass her a bit, while it is rude of her, unless it\u2019s something you\u2019ve brought up before, you kinda came out the gate swinging with that one but I understand why.", "Why are you so fixated with putting everyone\u2019s ages in this story?? It\u2019s not relevant at all and makes you seem like a judgmental AH.", "You should've used a Sopranos voice.", "NTA", "\\> now this lady proceeds to glare at me anytime she sees me in the gym.\n\nLook her straight in the eyes while you do your sets", "I used to work at a gym and had to break up petty arguments between people over these damn machines all the time. Someone walks away for a second but leaves their towel on the machine while they get a drink and someone throws their towel on the floor and starts using it. Someone is rotating between multiple machines and gets into it with someone who didn't realize and jumped on one on the off rotation. Someone was thinking about maybe using a machine while someone else hopped on. \n\nI have been screamed at and spit on by women and men of all ages for asking them to be conscientious of their fellow gym goers and share the freaking machines. I've even had to break up orgies in the sauna with guys on the DL. I've replaced shower curtains that people kept poking holes in to creep on others. I have seen swarms of roaches and cleaned all manner of bodily fluids off of mirrors, floors and walls. I will never go back to working at a gym ever in my life. I would sooner be homeless. \n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA. This is what should be encouraged tbh. I understand resting BETWEEN sets, but if you're not using the machine and there are literally people waitin? Use the thing or leave.", "NTA", "NTA, fire all weapons I reckon! This is the absolute worst kind of behaviour - I\u2019ve never actually seen someone say no if they\u2019re just sitting on equipment chatting, but that would make my blood boil.", "I didn\u2019t even think about reporting her to management because that\u2019s not y\u2019all\u2019s job, right? I thought they were more in charge of logistics: membership/basic gym questions, keep things clean, monitor safety (though de facto it seems like you were also the schoolyard teacher at your old gym \ud83d\ude02) What are your thoughts?\n\nIt\u2019s a shame you had to deal with this so frequently. I\u2019ve mostly only run into AHs lacking this kind of etiquette in college gyms\u2026 real lifters are generally respectful and conscientious. I\u2019ve had people be space cadets and not realize they\u2019re holding something up\u2026but they\u2019ll usually apologize and move/offer for you to work in.", "The ages reflect that we\u2019re all adults, and that there was an age/potentially power differential between the women.\n\nI think you may be projecting your own ageist biases upon my story. Time to reflect on implicit/explicit biases?\n\nI\u2019d further recommend coming in a little less hot when providing feedback, using more productive language, and perhaps less cuss words. \ud83d\ude09\n\n*whoops, there I go being condescending to disrespectful people again. Sigh.", "Most people never grow up. They keep acting like they're in high school. Most people are entitled dicks. Especially people that can afford higher end gym memberships."]}
