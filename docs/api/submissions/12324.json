Those poor gym staffers. I can\u2019t imagine being the type of person to expect them to manage such silly squabbles (if she felt harassed or unsafe that would of course be a totally different a story and should be brought to their attention\u2026but that wasn\u2019t the case by a long shot). The poor kid seemed so uncomfortable bringing it up to me.", "I think she was shocked that I said something and removed herself. Ive been told that I come across as pretty assertive and confident in public speaking/new situations. The shy girl barely made eye contact with her and was soft spoken, I think she felt more comfortable brushing her off because of that. Which  frustrated me because aside from general gym etiquette\u2026women need to support women, especially when it comes to building confidence in the weight room. \n\nRe: paying too much attention: when you go to the gym daily at the same time you start to see familiar faces.

Just because other people are more timid doesn't mean you have to be as well.", "NTA - you did the right thing, people like this lady act like they do  is because people don't cause a fuss out of a desire to avoid awkwardness and confrontation, so they never get called out.\n\nThe more people who point out bad behaviour does help curb it.\n\nYou did the right thing and the gym should have had your back.", "NTA. People like your friend boil my blood, sitting back and watching people be shit is exactly why this world is so f-ed up right now. Her attitude stinks, as does chatty lady. You, you are a good egg!", "Thank you so much. Hogging the equipment to simply catch up with mates or look at your phone, are why I stopped going to the gym.", "I think you're in the clear. NTA. I appreciate you telling her that her behavior is inappropriate. If she glares at you, that's because she's thinking was that NPC speaking to me because she's an asshole.", "NTA - Were you being rude? Yes. We\u2019re you being appropriate? Also yes.", "ESH\n\n\nYup, you should have been more polite.\nAnger and aggressive language would indeed provoke anyone, no need to escalate immediately.", "Are you me?!

However, once I'm on my time, the filter is off and you'd swear I worked down on the docks \ud83e\udd23\nNTA by the way. Equipment hogging is a pet peeve of mine.

No you should not have used an F bomb. And maybe it would have been good to talk to an employee first and see if they would address it. But you said this lady was a repeat offender.

If you said it to her out of the blue then yeah, but someone else asked and she said no while continuing camp time.", "NTA and I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, if she wants to glare at you, oh well", "NTA, sometimes people need to be called out for being jerks. You were not over the top.", "NTA. I just quit a gym like this and joined a new one because management would not do anything about people taking endless selfies and TikTok\u2019s instead of actually exercising. It was so disruptive and I could never get a good workout in. My new gym doesn\u2019t allow it.", "NTA in any way, shape or form.

You could have said the same thing in a manner that makes.you look civilized.", "As a fellow female, I can tell you for sure that using more diplomatic language is far less effective and is a big waste of time.

Some people just feel that they're so privileged that they own the damn place. They don't. Good for you.", "NTA, but it probably would have been smarter to use slightly less harsh language. The lady sitting on the machine 100% deserved everything you said, it's just that now you've created a more awkward situation for yourself than you had to.", "NTA. There are plenty of people like her at my gym and also the ones who just sit there texting.", "NTA, u stood up for someone who could not do it herself and its commendable as not many ppl do it. gym machines are for working our & not resting places or places to engage in conversation.", "As a gym goer, I thank you.

I know its a hyperbolic circumstance to apply this expression to, but \"the only thing necessary for evil to triumph in the world is that good men do nothing\".

We must always protect others especially the weaker ones. The \"it doesn't happen to me so none of my business\" is cowardly.", "NTA. More people should be like you and call out rude behavior, even if it means being a little rude yourself. Inconsiderate people deserve to be told off.", "NTA.\n\nShe's a subspecies from people who talk on their phone at a food counter and have the audacity to tell the staff to hold on whilst they finish their conversation   They have remarkable tendencies to hold up.the line and make others wait.", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for someone who wasn't able to stand up for themselves.", "NTA you did what community is supposed to do.  We are supposed to hold ourselves and each other to agreed upon community standards.\n\nThat\u2019s how society works.", "NTA. That was really nice you did that for that girl. That lady needs to know what she is doing is annoying and selfish", "Repeat offenders at the gym get noticed.", "But it\u2019s not a silly squabble. What she\u2019s doing is basically reserving a machine until she\u2019s ready to use it which most gyms don\u2019t allow. I find it hard to believe this is the first time she was approached and asked if they can use the machine she was sitting on. \n\nTell management every time. I\u2019d even loop in a friend or two to make additional complaints.", "Think of it like this: the gym wants people to use their gym. People will not want to use the gym if people are using their equipment as lounge seats. You bringing it to their attention means that people who want to work out at the gym will use that gym", "Clearly qualifies as \"it takes a village\".", "She should have talked to a employee about it first.", "Do you know that it stands for .\n\nF-- fornication\nU-- under\nC-- consent\nOf the\nK-- king\n\nFun fact", "Have you ever thought that maybe you shouldn't use it way too freely?", "Why? Did that woman talk to an employee every time she hogged the machine? OP was totally in the right."]}
