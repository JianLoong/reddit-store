When that happens, it's worth trying a little bit harsher language.  She's glaring at you now, because her only other option would be to realize that she was wrong, and she's  *certainly* not going to do that.", "NTA.  If the lady wants to sit on a machine and occupy it so others can't use it, she can buy one and put it in her home.  It's a community gym and people need to share.   You pointing that out to someone shouldn't be required and definitely doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA - and each time she glares at you look at your watch as if you're timing her. She'll be a little more mindful of hogging space.", "NTA - the lady doesn't own the gym so she doesn't have a right to hog the machine to the detriment of everyone else.\n\nI think every gym has at least one of these types.  Good for you to call her out.", "In the future, you can report her to the gym... and THEY can deal with her.  NTA though.", "NTA. I hate gym squatters. I ask people to move all the time at my gym.", "NTA\n\nA gym is a business.

Otherwise they will brush you off. Rude people anywhere sucks. Rude people at the gym need to be called out. More people should call out rude behavior. It would make the world a better place.", "NTA. Be sure to express to management what this woman is doing. It's rude of her to take up space and machines that could actually be used by other people. Thank you for calling her out!", "NTA. This was a clear warning for her, i hope she will try ti be more considerate of othe people in the gym next time. She can glare as much as she wants, this only says that everytime shr sees you, she is aware, and thats a good thing in my opinion.", "NTA. The gym I go to has one piece of equipment that for some reason all the little older ladies seem to sit down at and half-heartedly push the pedals while chatting or playing Candy Crush for an hour plus. Meanwhile, it's one of the machines that my cardiac rehab team suggested I use. So an hour goes by and I've done all the rest of my workout and want to get my last 30 minutes in on the machine, and the same lady is still sitting there, babbling away. Drives me bananas.", "YTA wasn't your place. If she's a \"repeat offender\" why has it not been discussed with management? Why do you spend so much time watching what she does?", "OP's my hero.\n\nThere's a woman like that at my gym.  She supersets multiple machines with 5+ minute rests at 5pm in the gym, and uses eg the only leg sled and one of the three racks (to do half squats, no less) for 30+ minutes during peak gym hours.  No worries though, she's friends w/ the gym staff so screw everyone else.", "I wouldn't say that saying someone's behavior is f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* up is cursing them out.  it's just using a curse word.  for it to be cursing them out I would expect curse words directed at them, describing them.", "The management usually does nothing", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
