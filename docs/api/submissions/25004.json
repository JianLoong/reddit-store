A zero tip is a little harsh but if he overcharged you then he essentially forfeited his tip to the bar owner and potentially lost out on you coming back because he screwed up twice.

That's the kind of service for a tip, not having to ask multiple times", "Off topic but are tabs very common in the US? Here in Aus most people just pay individually for each drink, tabs are pretty uncommon.", "I assume this is the US? Is the tab just the total and nothing else?\n\nI've honestly never seen a caf\u00e9/pub/restaurant bill that _wasn't_ itemized. It seems outlandish that I'd get a bill with just a sum scribbled/printed in there. Not that I don't trust the establishment, but the register automatically makes it, it's not someone painstakingly typing it, is it?\n\nI feel like if everyone asked for one all the time, it would become standard for you guys as well. So definitely keep asking.", "Slight YTA.  It sounds like the barkeeper was busy, and was either getting around to it or it slipped his mind.  You should have asked again for an itemized receipt.  You may feel even without tip you ended up paying more bc the bill was unexpectedly high, but none of that goes to the barkeeper.  You deserved to have the assurance you're paying the correct amount, but unless he was trying to gouge you (seems farfetched), the barkeeper also deserved a tip.", "ESH. Just a crappy situation for everyone involved. You're not wrong for wanting an itemized receipt, but as a service worker I can tell you that might be a pain the ass. Time I should be spending helping other customers so I might keep my job.", "NTA. If they can\u2019t provide an itemized receipt, I don\u2019t find it unreasonable to assume that bill is inaccurate. IMO it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t even need to be asked for. An itemized receipt should be the norm.", "The bot counts your comment as Y-T-A because it counts the first acronym in the comment. Change it", "NTA. A zero tip was not harsh enough. The tab looked high, and the bartender couldn\u2019t back it up? Sounds like a rip off.

I asked for an itemized receipt, he said he would give me one. \n\nSeven minutes later he still hadn\u2019t given me one.", "I\u2019ve never had an itemized receipt from a bar.  Probably considered dive bars.  You know going in it\u2019s gonna cost a lot of money.  Good bartenders work their ass off.  They also have to deal with old regulars who are jerks and make snide comments.", "In the US, tipping a bartender isn't mandatory, but it is definitely the expectation.", "In most southern US states, tipped wages for a bartender is less than $3/hour. Topping is absolutely mandatory. In many small shit hole bars, you don't even get paid hourly, you just get your tips.", "Being in the rural South of America, sometimes we\u2019re raised to just accept when people try to deny service, it\u2019s just best to accept denial of service. \n\nDunno. I just wanted a detailed receipt. And the bartender wouldn\u2019t give me one. \n\nSo I felt no desire or obligation to tip.", "I asked for an itemized receipt. He kept noticing me and recognizing me when I tipped my hand for something. \n\nHe legit didn\u2019t give me a receipt when I asked for one.", "Yeah I agree with a slight YTA. If it was busy, I feel like you got to ask twice before you get mad.", "It\u2019s 3 drinks over an hour of time.

I don\u2019t think he forgot or was that busy or couldn\u2019t ask a colleague to help other customers so he could get you the receipt - he was deliberately not getting you one because he couldn\u2019t justify overcharging you and didn\u2019t want to get in to trouble.\n\nHere in the UK, pretty much all receipts are itemised (or at least I\u2019ve never been anywhere here where it\u2019s not standard) It was quite reasonable for you as a customer to request an itemised receipt and within the bartender\u2019s job remit to provide one so his failure to provide you with one so you don\u2019t have to tip him.", "I've never *not* had an itemised receipt at a bar.

When I asked for an itemized receipt, multiple times, and wasn\u2019t given one, I don\u2019t think I should give a tip if no one can prove what service the tip is based on.", ">Topping is absolutely ~~mandatory~~ a **social convention**\n\nFTFY", "This might sound rude, but that's not my problem. Why should I pay for another persons income? Where I'm from tipping is not expected. I worked as a waitress for a few years, and was paid well. But for the last few years it seems that they are trying to bring the tipping culture here. If you pay by card you have to check if you want to tip and how much. I don't like this. Why should I tip someone for bringing me my drink to the table. If I like the service, maybe. Usually you just round up the price. For example, if the drink was 4,60\u20ac you can round up to 5.", "Ok, let's assume it is \"mandatory\" to tip.
