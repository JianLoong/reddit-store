It\u2019s not hard for him because he barely does anything, AND he doesn\u2019t have to clean and cook on top of it. Not to mention, he doesn\u2019t seem willing to let it change. NTA, you should definitely stand your ground.", "NTA, he wants 0 responsability, 0 task to do, and his free Time, while you have to do everything so he can have that, that's a Big redflag.", "NTA\n\nDon't work evenings, it will burn you out before you know it. You already work full time being a mom and you need that quiet time in the evening to decompress, not to mention you and your partner to have time together without the kids. \n\nJust don't apply to evening jobs, it's that simple. Don't even continue the discussion with him, tell him you won't do it and that's that.", "NTA, but your husband sure is. Just another case of the expectations for what women can handle being so much more than what men can handle. I only work weekends and am a stahm during the week. I genuinely cannot imagine working every day until midnight and then having to get up early every day to take care of my kids. I know some people do it. There are single moms and dads who work 3 jobs. But you\u2019re not a single mom, no matter how much your partner wants to treat you like one.", "In short:\n\n\nHe wants you to work evenings because then you would do 100% of the house work and if you work both full time during the day, he would have to do equal work...\n\n\nBut if you work full time in the evenings, he expects childcare and 100% house work...\n\n\n\nDon't let youself be fooled.", "NTA. Your partner wants you to accommodate him but will not accommodate you. He specifically sought out a younger partner to have the power imbalance that now exists because he assumed you would always cater to him. \n\nHe will not take this well so please be sure you have an exit strategy for you and the little ones in case it becomes necessary.", "NTA. What does your partner do? It seems like you're the main one taking care of the kids, the house, and cooking meals while he only works his job but doesn't help out around the house. Do not listen to him and do not take an evening job, you will be so tired and burned out and possibly lash out at the kids due to feeling overwhelmed and overworked. Either he needs to get another job to help support your income needs or you guys can get a babysitter and you both can go to work.", "Info: When you're applying for jobs are you explaining that you'll also be looking after your kids? This could be part of the issue.\n\nCould you put the kids in nursery whilst you work during the day?", "NTA. He wants you to put in the extra work while he continues barely putting any effort into his children and home.", "NTA. Looking after kids is a full time job in itself.", "**NTA** \n\nYou would literally be working day and night.", "Absolutely NTA. An evening job is a terrible idea for you. \n\nI think you also need a childcare plan for if you do get a job working from home.", "NTA, you will get burnt out and resentfull. He is an AH for even suggesting you spend all day with the kids, then work full time at night. When do you get to relax? Or even sleep?!", "You are definitely nta. I worked nights and weekends with my baby while staying home for a year and I was so burned out. Your husband doesn't sound like a partner here. I'd have a real conversation and work together to make a plan to divide the work. If he won't agree to help, then I would really think if he's the right person. Your kids are young but they notuce a lot more than you think.", "NTA  \nit's not fair to ask you to be on the clock 24-7 and this would be exactly that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why?\n\nI feel like there is a missing reason here if the plan is to get a job that pays well so the kids can go to nursery.\n\nOr if you work evenings is he thinking you'll do childcare in the day because he will be doing childcare in the evening? It'll save money, but then you'll barely see each other!"]}
