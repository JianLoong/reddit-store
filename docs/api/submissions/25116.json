She thinks I should have married a 'REAL' American even though my wife has her citizenship now.", "selftext": "Sorry this is long, my (m32) wife Sophie (made up name) (f30) is amazing...  She puts up with me and we share raising our two girls 6, 8 years old.  She is a SAHM/W and does most of the house cleaning, shopping for the family, runs errands, helps to homeschool our girls with a neighborhood group.  She's educated with a degree in math and intended to teach until she had our first daughter and realized she'd rather have more influence over HER girls education over other peoples kids.\n\nShe is (in my opinion) absolutely beautiful, she's funny, doesn't wear much make up or fuss with what she wears.  I want to call her a 'natural beauty' but don't really like that term, she's just a beauty.  We have some usual disagreements but nothing major, we always talk them out.  I, to use the phrase, out punted my coverage when I married her.  I got the better end of the deal in my mind.\n\nI work full time as a chemical engineer and work for the military under contract.  I work mostly regular hours except when I need to leave to oversee a military test.  I make more money than we need, we're fairly frugal with some really nice things.  Decent, solid vehicles, a nice big house on a really big bunch of land in the country (one of the luxuries), our 401k's are funded.  She spends what she wants or needs to spend.  And we're happy, that's the most important thing.\n\nNow here's the fly in the pie.  My mom is a DL as my oldest daughter says, a Drama Llama who always has to have something to be angry about for whatever reason.  She picks on Sophie for not being a 'real' American even though she got her citizenship awhile back.  She is from England, and has a amazing accent which I love, and there just isn't much else anything wrong with her that's major.  My mom has stepped up her complaints because my daughters can mimic an English accent really well which I find really funny.\n\nMy mom also complains that I do most of the cooking after work (I do because I like it and I'm better) even though Sophie cleans up most of the time.  We share things outdoors, flower and veggie gardens, mowing, cleaning up things.  I deal with the cars.  One of the few things my wife does on her own is going to the gym 2-3 times a week, the library since she loves to read, and a women's coffee club.  I don't limit her, she can do what she wants as long as I'm home with the girls.  We really do have a fun marriage.  Yet my mom finds something about her to complain about every single time we visit.  \n\n**\\*Edit\\***  In response to a lot of comments I and 'Sophie' haven't just let her comments go unchallenged.  My girls are fully aware about how inappropriate their g-mas comments are.  So I think this upcoming week I'm going to have a cup of coffee with mom and just tell her it's time to completely knock off the snarky comments or she just won't see us, period.  \n\nSophie is pretty classy and doesn't stoop to my moms level and respond in a negative way.  However my oldest girl picked up some British insults from when my wife talks to her family on the phone that I had to look up, my daughter told my mom she'd 'lost the plot' which my wife fell over laughing about, later she told me it meant, completely stupid...  true but I had to tell my daughter not to do it... lol...

One day I flat out told her that If she doesn't have anything nice to say about people then I don't want to hear it.  It took many years of her kids telling her the same thing, but when I spoke up it hit her hard.  She wanted me to apologize but I refused.  When she tried to complain to her kids they backed me up.  Since then whenever she would start to say something she would look at me and just stop.  Her kids were delighted.  She still thinks, after 41 years of me being married to her son, that I am not good enough, but she is far less critical when speaks to others.
