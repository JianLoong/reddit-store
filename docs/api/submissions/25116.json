She puts up with me and we share raising our two girls 6, 8 years old.  She is a SAHM/W and does most of the house cleaning, shopping for the family, runs errands, helps to homeschool our girls with a neighborhood group.

I want to call her a 'natural beauty' but don't really like that term, she's just a beauty.  We have some usual disagreements but nothing major, we always talk them out.

My mom is a DL as my oldest daughter says, a Drama Llama who always has to have something to be angry about for whatever reason.

She is from England, and has a amazing accent which I love, and there just isn't much else anything wrong with her that's major.  My mom has stepped up her complaints because my daughters can mimic an English accent really well which I find really funny.  \n\nMy mom also complains that I do most of the cooking after work (I do because I like it and I'm better) even though Sophie cleans up most of the time.  We share things outdoors, flower and veggie gardens, mowing, cleaning up things.  I deal with the cars.  One of the few things my wife does on her own is going to the gym 2-3 times a week, the library since she loves to read, and a women's coffee club.  I don't limit her, she can do what she wants as long as I'm home with the girls.  We really do have a fun marriage.

Also, feel free to point out that despite your wife's change of citizenship her grandchildren are half-English as well.

Really, would she prefer you to be married to a real American girl not from your state with a heavy accent (nothing wrong with that, just if it's the accent she's after...)? \nIf you want to stick it to your mom you can take some ancestry DNA test and then start commenting about what should mommy do as a real polish/Irish/Italian - whatever you see there.", "YWNBTA. \n\nTell your mother she's creating a future that doesn't include your wife, you, or your children unless her behaviour changes.", "You would not be the AH at all.  Your mom needs be told that if she can't say something nice about your wife you do not want to hear it.  You will need to be firm with her and if she starts to go off on your wife remind her that you are not going to listen to it.  My MIL criticized everyone, especially me.  One day I flat out told her that If she doesn't have anything nice to say about people then I don't want to hear it.  It took many years of her kids telling her the same thing, but when I spoke up it hit her hard.  She wanted me to apologize but I refused.  When she tried to complain to her kids they backed me up.  Since then whenever she would start to say something she would look at me and just stop.  Her kids were delighted.  She still thinks, after 41 years of me being married to her son, that I am not good enough, but she is far less critical when speaks to others.  You can't control what comes out of her mouth but you can control what you will put up with from her.  Tell her you will spend time with her if she does not stop.", "NTA.

You're an awesome husband. Keep standing up for your wife!

Not your wife's citizenship,  not who does what around the house, nothing.\n\nGood for you for supporting your wife, but yes, you have to do more that just hint or ignore your mom's comments.", "NTA.

However...\n\n>compared to her other DIL's, my wife is awesome\n\nI would not recommend saying this part out loud, at least not to to your mom, or in any forum where it could get back to her.\n\nIf your mom thrives on drama as much as you say, that sort of comparison is just asking for trouble. It will just give her new fodder for her drama. Plus, if you say it while calling her out, you risk having her latch onto that statement and ignore everything else you're telling her.\n\nBesides, your wife sounds pretty great all on her own.
