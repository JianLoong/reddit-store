If she's mad about it, then she should move out. It's reasonable and a sound tactic to create consequences for not moving out, and you must be pretty nice for her to feel comfortable enough to not even be looking for another place.  \n\n\nHowever, I'm guessing her living there is informal, meaning she's not on the lease. I could be wrong, but you can give someone written notice and in either case (she's on the lease or she's not on the lease), it very likely doesn't have any legal standing.  \n\n\nWhat I'm saying here is you can tell her she has to pay that rate, but there isn't any way to MAKE her pay that rate. She could simply refuse to pay you at all, and it would be very difficult to recuperate that money regardless of the actual lease. (Or maybe you own the property and she's living there.)NTA, and I would consider being more of an asshole if these ultimatums don't move her.", "NTA, she is not entitled to a lower rent. You gave her plenty of time and a fair warning", "NTA- She should have been gone.", "NTA. You gave her plenty of notice. She's supposed to be out soon.", "Totally NTA- you were extra kind to her because you were in a relationship. Now that the relationship is over, you don't owe her kindness, just civility, the same as you would a stranger off the street. And she has some nerve expecting a discount when she can well afford to pay the market rate.\n\nedit: maybe the rent increase will be incentive to get her rear in gear with finding a new place.", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to profit off her. She isn\u2019t your GF anymore so she is there in the capacity of a tenant. If she doesn\u2019t like it, she can go. \n\nHowever I\u2019d say that you should just tell her to get out under any circumstance. You don\u2019t want to be living with your ex for any price.", "If she can afford it and you gave her notice I don\u2019t see the problem", "NTA. If she thinks it's so unfair she can move out. She seems to be happy profiting off you by paying a reduced rate.", "INFO, were you charging her rent while you were dating? Were you two not splitting the rent evenly?", "you should've just kicked her out. it's not your problem if she isn't ready. now you need to give her another notice.", "INFO you said you owned the house and y\u2019all split the mortgage in half.

I should definitely put the rent and other roommate details in writing though.", "Guessing OP owes the place and they likely spilt the mortgage in half.", "That's right. It is my house and we were splitting the mortgage. I bought it while we were dating and had been fixing it up for a couple years before she moved in. She's been living here for almost a year. The $800 is half the mortgage, but most of my housing expenses are loans from the renovations.", "Semantics. You say charge but cost sharing is a normal thing amongst couples. \n\nUnless you're saying girlfriends should be entitled to not have to pay?", "So you\u2019re one of those that think when two people live together, they shouldn\u2019t each pay rent?", "Yeah, is that uncommon? She was helping me cover ongoing housing expenses. We both agreed it was reasonable when she moved in.", "Yea wait that\u2019s weird", "No, I'm in a fairly HCOL area. Market rent for my house would be $2500 according to Zillow", "Where do you live?!

She's actually legally has equity in your house in many, many places. You might want to check that out and pray she doesn't find out if that's the case.", "Not uncommon at all. No free rides in my opinion.", "And this is a house you own?", "Ah alright then", "Thought so\u2026 think it fair that you hike it up since u can\u2019t have someone take over until she leaves.\n\nHave you checked what you can do legally to make her leave or pay the increase rent?", "That's a fair concern. Not to get too into the weeds, but I'm towards the beginning of 30 year mortgage and she's been living here less than a year. 95% of what she paid is going towards interest on the loan. If she wants to sue me for the <$1000 of equity she accumulated, she can go ahead.", "To make her leave, I'd have to start the eviction process, which I'd rather avoid. Plus I'd feel like an ass if I evicted her before she had anywhere to go.\n\nI looked it up and I'm well within my legal rights to raise the rent.", "It doesn't matter if it's going towards the interest on the loans. And how can it be <1000 if she's paying 800$ a month for almost? Half? A year?", "Very reasonable amount considering interest.", "It has to do with the amortization schedule of the loan. I've accumulated $2024 of equity in the house since the time she moved in. So IF she was entitled to equity, she would have $1012. Technically you caught me exaggerating : )", "There is almost no concern for her having equity. \n\n\nAlso, you have a lease. A verbal contract at the minimum with month to month tenancy. \n\nShe was not paying half the mortgage. She was paying a cash amount that happened to be equal to half the primary mortgage as rent. \n\nIf you have other loan payments for remodeling costs plus insurance and taxes; she was not paying even close 50/50. \n\nThere is a lot of Reddit drama over splitting living costs when one person is the owner.", "Info: how is this legal? You have her a 30 day notice to vacate and even if she isn\u2019t out, I\u2019m not sure you can legally increase her rent by over 50%. Asking a question!", "NTA- You gave her a deadline, she was too slow at finding a place, and by the deadline she was still there. You gave them plenty of time to find a place.", "NTA good news is you're not married to her or have any kids. So now you can start off fresh and kick her out.", "NTA raise the rent to $5000 if you have to. It doesn\u2019t take that long to find a new apartment especially if you mentioned she has the budget for a luxury one. \n\nYou broke up. It\u2019s weird she hanging around but you don\u2019t owe each other anything anymore. Seems like a really unhealthy living environment, you both need to let go", "NTA but make sure you have everything in writing and that there are no laws in place that cap rent increases. This situation could get very messy - you are better off asking her to move into a friend's house on the originally agreed on date, otherwise you may find it impossible to get her to leave.", "In my location a landlord can increase rent for any reason so long as there's a legitimate reason (market conditions, not retaliation, etc.). Pretty sure charging market rate would be considered legitimate.", "You need to sit down and have another conversation. Tell her that she needs to be actively trying to find a new place. That she needs to leave ASAP. That you don\u2019t really want to evict her, but you will if you feel she\u2019s not trying to find a new place. \n\nAgree to a hard out. I know you already gave her a date, but agree to a new date. Tell her you\u2019ll increase the rent each week she goes beyond the move out date. That might be the incentive she needs to quickly get her own place.", "In many US jurisdictions, your sending a rental increase notice will nullify the 30 day notice. If you want her out then start the eviction. If you are not prepared to move forward with an eviction then don't start the process.", "It takes months to evict someone, and you are being nice and letting them walk all over you because they have no intention of leaving.  \n\nIf they had, you would have said they have been applying, saying they have bad credit or some other excuse.\n\nP.S. You are being an AH to yourself by not standing up for yourself better.  I'm not going to judge you because I have the same damn problem.", "Sometimes the amount increase is not. Usually it\u2019s a certain percentage. Then breaking up is not a legal reason, for where I\u2019m living anyway.", "Btw, I\u2019m in the US.", "Would your price hike to $1200+ be market rate for a single room sublet within a house? (Which sounds like is the actual living situation.) Or is that the market rate for a 1br apartment or an entire 1br house/townhouse?", "Maybe it was the wording seeming weird to that person? I think it\u2019s weird to call it \u201ccharging rent\u201d maybe (when she was a GF) but the act of her paying for housing was not weird, unless you\u2019d been having her shoulder an unreasonable amount (you weren\u2019t).", "I believe she's trying to find a place. She's been visiting apartments every week, stressing over location, amenities, and money. She's just really bad at actually making a decision.\nWe've had ongoing discussions about getting out asap. For better or worse, it would be illegal for me to raise the rent in that manner.", "The market rate to rent the whole house would be $2500 according to Zillow. So $1250 would be the price of a room within the house.", "Info, what are the landlord tenant laws in your jurisdiction? Where I live, you could not raise the rent so much with so little notice. Stick to the law and NAH.", "NTA\n\nYou're not together anymore, she's just another tenant. You're perfect in the right to charge her market rate\u2026with a month to month agreement, in writing.", "YTA - cost sharing is fine, but you get to keep the asset, so I think you need to have some compromise here. I think keep her on the same rate that she was on until she finds a new place - her money helped you build wealth.", "NTA, and check local laws. She's not technically a tenant as much as she's a lodger. Different rights so make sure you know the correct steps to take next", "The laws are pretty favorable to the landlord in my state aside from when it comes to eviction. There is no cap on how much rent can be increased, but one legitimate reason for a price increase is market rates. Same thing about notice, no specific duration, it just needs to be \"reasonable\". It's way too subjective imo... I let her know as soon as it became evident she wasn't going to be out by the deadline. So afaik I'm sticking to the laws.", "I see what you're saying, but I see it differently. She saved more on rent living with me than I saved sharing housing expenses with her. I could hypothetically rent out the room she's in for the market rate, why should she get special status now that we're broken up?", "What if you just let her know it's your next step?\n\n\"If you don't move by July 31, I will begin legal eviction proceedings. At the end of that process, you will not only be homeless, but no reputable landlord will even consider renting to you. Leaving on your own is your best option. You have two weeks to sort yourself out and go.\"", "I need info, do you own the place, is this an apartment or a house/condo? If it\u2019s an apartment, are you both on the lease? I assume not based on the way you\u2019re talking about giving her a 30 day notice. Legally, I\u2019m not sure what you can do based on the information you\u2019ve provided", "You\u2019ll need to have a lease", "I see - you're calculating this as though it's two equally-footed roommates splitting rent on a multi bedroom rental home VS calculating it like a home owner renting out a spare bedroom & allowing access to common areas. I would argue these are technically different situations with very different \"market rates,\" but no point in quibbling as you know your area better.\n\nI'll just say, asking for more money is likely going to hinder the ex in getting out of your house. She probably needs 1-3 months rent on a new place up front, plus moving expenses. Increasing the rent by nearly $500 seems unhelpful if the goal is to get her out. Also, I wonder if by imposing additional rent, you are tacitly extending the lease?... And I wonder if you must then restart eviction proceedings at step 1 should you choose to go that route? Things to consider. \n\nAs to whether YTA? Yeah, kinda seems like it. This seems retaliatory and counterproductive unless the additional money is actually required for you to keep the mortgage afloat. (Doesn't sound like that's the case.) And I think your \"market rate\" argument is untested. I come from a high cost of living area myself (Los Angeles) & personally wouldn't pay $1200 to rent a bedroom in a house with a stranger roommate who is also my landlord. (I'd be interested in an update to see if you end up getting someone to pay that much if you end up renting out later.) I wouldn't assume laws are in your favor regarding the steep rent increase unless you're an attorney/have gotten formal legal counsel on the matter.", "NTA give her another 30 days and if she isn't gone the day after start eviction proceedings.", "Thanks for the comment. I just looked it up, and we would fall under landlord-tenant relationship under the circumstances.", "What do you actually pay?", "> She says she doesn't think it's fair because I'd be profiting off her.\n\nIs she... Unclear on how a capitalist market functions? Is she aware that her next landlord will also be profiting off her?", "YTA. Your girlfriend may have issues with procrastination but you are taking advantage of her foible.\n\nAs you don't have a written lease (or sublease), there is nothing that compels your ex to pay the higher amount you plan on charging her for a bedroom. She may have squatter's rights.  You may have to go through a formal eviction if she chooses not to leave on your timetable. I was in a similar situation once and even though I wasn't on the lease, I had rights. I couldn't be dismissed or put out like yesterday's trash.\n\nYour girlfriend is right that you are profiting from her living with you. You profit by having $800 of your rent paid thus freeing $800 that you would otherwise pay. You don't state what the total rent is but $800.00 is still a significant amount to pay every  month for a bedroom.\n\nAlso consider that if you want to be rid of her, dunning her for a higher payment will mean she may have less to put towards first and last months' rent on a place of her own.", "Evict her asap.  She's taking advantage of you and giving you nothing in return.  NTAH.", "Knowin\u2019 how he made her feel.", "Totally agree- jointly paying a mortgage then she gets ditched and he cashes in on a house she paid for half of? Yuck. \n\nSound like she\u2019s had a lucky escape.", "Do you live in the same house or apartment? Usually this makes her a lodger not a tenant.", "Start bringing people around to tour her room. Also this justifies having her pay market rent if she drags out our past your move out date. If others will gladly pay what you\u2019re asking, then she should either pay market rate or move out. I personally would push her harder to move out. She can rent an Airbnb and put her stuff in storage if she can\u2019t get it together to find a place by the move out date.", "Really? My previous house in MI was $2500/mo and it is a fairly low COL area. $2500 would get you a run down 1 maybe 2 bedroom house in my current medium COL west coast city. I used to pay $2k a decade ago for a bedroom in a shared house in a high COL west coast city. You should see what people in NYC pay. I consider $1250 a month fairly inexpensive rent for a bedroom, especially in a medium or high COL city", "It's kind of a vague question. Not including utilities, I pay about $2900 between my mortgage, renovation loans, and ongoing renovation costs. I bought a fixer upper, so the renovations cost almost as much as the mortgage. \n\nWhether I'm charging her $825 or $1250, it doesn't amount to half of what I'm putting into the house.", "As much as I'd like to think it's worth more, the house is still being renovated. The indoor common areas are in good shape, but the back deck is a work in progress and not currently usable.", "The best way to know is to start looking for new housemates. This would also be a useful wake up call that she needs to gtfo when she sees that plenty of people are glad to pay $1250 in rent."]}
