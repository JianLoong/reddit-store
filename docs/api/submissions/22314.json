Remind her she has one week to have her stuff out of your place.\n\nMarket rate sounds fair if you don't mind her being a roommate, but make sure you get it in writing with strict penalties if she's late on rent.", "I don't understand not being motivated to move out after a breakup. If she's mad about it, then she should move out. It's reasonable and a sound tactic to create consequences for not moving out, and you must be pretty nice for her to feel comfortable enough to not even be looking for another place.  \n\n\nHowever, I'm guessing her living there is informal, meaning she's not on the lease. I could be wrong, but you can give someone written notice and in either case (she's on the lease or she's not on the lease), it very likely doesn't have any legal standing.  \n\n\nWhat I'm saying here is you can tell her she has to pay that rate, but there isn't any way to MAKE her pay that rate. She could simply refuse to pay you at all, and it would be very difficult to recuperate that money regardless of the actual lease. (Or maybe you own the property and she's living there.)NTA, and I would consider being more of an asshole if these ultimatums don't move her.", "NTA, she is not entitled to a lower rent. You gave her plenty of time and a fair warning", "NTA- She should have been gone.", "NTA. You gave her plenty of notice. She's supposed to be out soon.", "Totally NTA- you were extra kind to her because you were in a relationship. Now that the relationship is over, you don't owe her kindness, just civility, the same as you would a stranger off the street. And she has some nerve expecting a discount when she can well afford to pay the market rate.\n\nedit: maybe the rent increase will be incentive to get her rear in gear with finding a new place.", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to profit off her. She isn\u2019t your GF anymore so she is there in the capacity of a tenant. If she doesn\u2019t like it, she can go. \n\nHowever I\u2019d say that you should just tell her to get out under any circumstance. You don\u2019t want to be living with your ex for any price.", "If she can afford it and you gave her notice I don\u2019t see the problem", "NTA. If she thinks it's so unfair she can move out. She seems to be happy profiting off you by paying a reduced rate.", "INFO, were you charging her rent while you were dating? Were you two not splitting the rent evenly?", "you should've just kicked her out. it's not your problem if she isn't ready. now you need to give her another notice.", "INFO you said you owned the house and y\u2019all split the mortgage in half. Did y\u2019all live in the house Together? Or where you just paying half the mortgage and letting her pay half on a property you own?  Do you currently live in the house with her or what?", "I\u2019m sorry pause rewind, you were charging your gf rent?", "Where did you get $1250? I don\u2019t think ppl pay that with roommates? That sounds more like soemthing she\u2019d have to pay if she was staying at the house by herself. Or did you make it that high to scare her out?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not something either of us wants to go through. I should definitely put the rent and other roommate details in writing though.", "Guessing OP owes the place and they likely spilt the mortgage in half.", "That's right. It is my house and we were splitting the mortgage. I bought it while we were dating and had been fixing it up for a couple years before she moved in. She's been living here for almost a year. The $800 is half the mortgage, but most of my housing expenses are loans from the renovations.", "Semantics. You say charge but cost sharing is a normal thing amongst couples. \n\nUnless you're saying girlfriends should be entitled to not bag to pay?", "So you\u2019re one of those that think when two people live together, they shouldn\u2019t each pay rent?", "Yeah, is that uncommon? She was helping me cover ongoing housing expenses. We both agreed it was reasonable when she moved in.", "Yea wait that\u2019s weird", "No, I'm in a fairly HCOL area. Market rent for my house would be $2500 according to Zillow", "Where do you live?! In my city, a one bedroom (550 sq ft) is now $2800/month.", "I'm going to school in Victoria this fall and I'm looking at $1200/room before utilities", "Yeah, that's what was happening", "If she's been paying half the mortgage as your gf without a written lease.. She's actually legally has equity in your house in many, many places. You might want to check that out and pray she doesn't find out if that's the case.", "Not uncommon at all. No free rides in my opinion.", "And this is a house you own?", "Ah alright then", "Thought so\u2026 think it fair that you hike it up since u can\u2019t have someone take over until she leaves.\n\nHave you checked what you can do legally to make her leave or pay the increase rent?", "That's a fair concern. Not to get too into the weeds, but I'm towards the beginning of 30 year mortgage and she's been living here less than a year. 95% of what she paid is going towards interest on the loan. If she wants to sue me for the <$1000 of equity she accumulated, she can go ahead.", "To make her leave, I'd have to start the eviction process, which I'd rather avoid. Plus I'd feel like an ass if I evicted her before she had anywhere to go.\n\nI looked it up and I'm well within my legal rights to raise the rent.", "It doesn't matter if it's going towards the interest on the loans. And how can it be <1000 if she's paying 800$ a month for almost? Half? A year?", "Very reasonable amount considering interest.", "It has to do with the amortization schedule of the loan. I've accumulated $2024 of equity in the house since the time she moved in. So IF she was entitled to equity, she would have $1012. Technically you caught me exaggerating : )", "There is almost no concern for her having equity. \n\n\nAlso, you have a lease. A verbal contract at the minimum with month to month tenancy. \n\nShe was not paying half the mortgage. She was paying a cash amount that happened to be equal to half the primary mortgage as rent. \n\nIf you have other loan payments for remodeling costs plus insurance and taxes; she was not paying even close 50/50. \n\nThere is a lot of Reddit drama over splitting living costs when one person is the owner."]}
