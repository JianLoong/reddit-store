She has one girl, Molly 16 (not her real name obvi)  and two boys Tim(12) and Eric(10). GF (call her Carrie) moved in with me a few months ago, since my house has room for all of us, and things have been really good. Her kids are great, although the boys are more messy than I'm used to we've been adjusting. \n\nNow, Molly is Carrie's go to babysitter. Any time we go out, or if she has to work late or go somewhere she has Molly watch the boys. She's been doing this since Molly was about 12. Molly is a great kid, she's super smart, responsible, and hard working. She's in AP classes and she got her first job recently. But, she also doesn't go out very often. \n\nMolly was invited to a party at her friends house this weekend. Carrie said she could go. I took Molly shopping for a new outfit for it, just a new T shirt and some earings from hot topic, but she was super excited. It's the first party she's ever been invited to. I made sure she had my phone number and knew if she wasn't having fun(or things got weird, but I'm pretty sure they're just watching anime and ordering pizza. I've met the friend before) we would come get her. \n\nNow. \n\nCarrie likes to go this sports bar sometimes to hang out with her guy friends. I am not a sports person, so she usually goes on her own and I do whatever. This normally isn't a problem, because the kids will either be with their dad, or Molly will watch the boys for a few hours. Except this weekend, Molly had plans. When Carrie tells her she needs to cancel her plans because Carrie is going out, Molly get's upset. I've never seen the two of them argue before, but Molly is almost in tears trying to convince Carrie that it's not fair. \n\nHere's where I might be the AH. \n\nI stepped in, and told Carrie I could just watch the boys if she wanted to go out. I've helped raise my nieces and nephews since I was like 14, I already know them, it seemed like a simple solution. Carrie sends Molly to her room and then starts telling me off for butting in and undermining her authority on her daughter. She told me Molly needs to be ready to be responsible for her brothers at any time, since she's the oldest. I disagreed, I don't think that's a fair expectation, and Tim is as old now as Molly was when she first started baby sitting. \n\nCarrie snapped at me that they aren't her kids, and I pointed out that they aren't my kids but she brought them to my house, so does she expect me to not be involved in their lives or have opinions? \n\nSo. Am I the asshole for undermining her?", "created_utc": 1678222294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11laxxx/aita_for_offering_to_babysit_my_gfs_kids/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She uses her child as free babysitting whenever demanded and uses you for your home but doesn't allow you to be a partner in raising the children in your home?", "NTA You made an offer to watch the kids so Molly didn't have to. While GF doesn't have to accept the offer, I don't think it undermines her authority. Your GF, in my opinion, is massively out of line forcing Molly to babysit, especially when another option is available. First your GF is literally forcing her daughter to sacrifice her childhood, not do to an emergency but so she can go out and enjoy herself. Second, while having her daughter help while she still lives with her parents, including babysitting, isn't inherently wrong, saying that as the oldest she has to be ready to take care of her siblings at any time, is giving a child the parents responsibilities. Molly should not be expected to put her siblings over herself.", "NTA, and your girlfriend is a terrible parent. She\u2019s parentifying that poor child. And forcing her to babysit so that she can go out to the bar, when the child had preexisting plans? That\u2019s just awful. I would seriously reconsider being in a relationship with someone like this.", "NTA\n\nCarrie is being very selfish and has lost perspective. This may be about her not wanting Molly to grow up. \n\nYour offer to help is generous and seems like the obvious solution. Carrie took it as criticism instead of support. She got very defensive over her parenting. \n\nIt would help to know how long you have been together. If you plan to stay with each other, you'll become a parenting team, and your thoughts and ideas should not be dismissed out of hand like this.\n\nGood Luck!", "NTA\n\nWhat is Carrie's problem?\n\nYou just volunteered to babysit. It's not like you are trying to parent the sons or trying to make the sons see you as their mother. I didn't see you undermine Carrie at all.\n\nNow if Carrie still forces Molly to babysit, then that's the final say. You offered your services, and I don't like how Carrie made you out to be the bad guy.\n\nThey are in YOUR house. So you WILL have some say in how things are run technically with the kids. I hate to say this, but I don't think Carrie is a good mother and a good GF to you.\n\nEDIT: I feel like Carrie is using the OP for housing. What parent only dates someone else for a year and decides to move into their house with the kids this quickly? Why is the OP able to live with Carrie, but not allowed to watch the kids?", "NTA. All you did was offer a solution. Poor Molly, your girlfriend is making extremely poor parenting decisions and she will be lucky if Molly doesn't end up hating her.\n\nYour girlfriend is parentifying Molly, which in extreme forms can be considered abuse. It is so selfish for her to demand Molly cancel her already established plans just so she can go to a bar with buddies.  It is normal for you to think you would have a parental role since the kids are all living in your home. Although you should have discussed this before they moved in, you do need to discuss the role you will have with your gf.", "NTA. Does Carrie pay Molly to babysit? Or is she just expected to give up her spare time for free? Carrie made her plans after Molly made hers. It is COMPLETELY unacceptable to make Molly stay home and watch her brothers after already being given permission to go out.", "NTA what a shitty thing for a mother to do: give her teen permission to go have fun when it sounds like this is a kid who never goes out and then turn around and say nope, I have plans, now you she to cancel. I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing that to my daughter. You were in the right. Let\u2019s see if Molly ever comes home after she leaves the house if all she is going to be good to her mom for us a babysitter. Not to mention, if you live together, why would molly have to cancel??? If you will be home, what\u2019s the big damn deal??", "NTA, and I'd push back on the part where your girlfriend says \"Molly needs to be ready to be responsible for her brothers at any time, since she's the oldest.\" No, the parents need to be responsible for their children at all times. Tim and Eric aren't Molly's kids. Why should Molly be relied on like another parent? Good on you for sticking up for Molly. Keep pushing back on your girlfriend's bonkers expectations for Molly.", "NTA.\n\nCarrie is foisting her parental responsibilities into Molly, and that is abuse. I would not tolerate abuse in my home.", "Nta for advocating for Molly!!", "NTA\n\nCarrie is TA, she's parentified her daughter. They're not her kids, they're Carrie's. Tbh, I feel like Carrie was never intending to let Molly go and this was the plan from the get-go", "NTA what your gf did was really cruel and invalidating to her daughter.", "NTA those are Carried kids not Molly's. The kids are their parents responsibility and forcing the eldest sibling to look after the younger ones especially at the expense of their own life while you go enjoy yours and to top it off there is a capable and responsible 'babysitter ' available at no charge or notice. It's just stupid.", "NTA, but your gf is by prioritizing her entertainment over her child's, after giving permission. All Molly is learning is that her needs/wants come last it seems.", "NTA\n\nI think your suggestion was a perfect solution. Awesome show, great job!", ">I stepped in, and told Carrie I could just watch the boys\n\nIf you said it like that, then you're totally NTA.\n\nYou weren't undermining here, you just made an offering so that Molly wouldn't have to miss the party. You can't decide things and pass over your GF, they are her kids, but there's absolutely nothing wrong about making an offer to help everyone.\n\nAlso, this part sounds bad to me \n\n>She told me Molly needs to be ready to be responsible for her brothers at any time, since she's the oldest\n\nIs Molly supposed to leave aside her own life because her brothers could need her? Is she going to be on charge of them even when both are older enough to live as adults? This is too much for anyone.\n\nAs long as you didn't tried to impose your idea over Carrie, then you did good.", "Definitely NTA, for several reasons. First, Molly should not have to always be available to play fill-in mom whenever her mother decides she wants to go have fun. They're not her kids, and not her responsibility. Second, Carrie is risking her future relationship with her daughter as well by proving herself to be untrustworthy and unreliable. Kids remember stuff like that. Don't make promises you can't keep. Third, at 12 and 10 most children can take care of a lot of things themselves, so the boys would basically just need supervision. Why does she expect and trust her 16 year old daughter to keep an eye on her children, but not her grown adult longterm partners? This whole situation is a mess.", "NTA. She's got some nerve...", "OMFG, IS SHE SERIOUS? \nyour children are not your built in baby sitters or responsible for raising your other children.\nThat kid just wants to be able to hang out with her friends for once and your gf tells her she can't because she wants to do something she can do whenever, I'm really glad you steped in that women is an entitled mother. She is not immune to criticism when she is raising her kids wrong.\n\nI'm the older sister (20) in my family and I'm 12 years older than my younger sibling, which obviously makes me the designated baby sitter. But my mother always compromises with me, if I want to go out one weekend then I'll stay home to watch my sister on another weekend she wants to go out. We plan around each other, because she recognizes that I'm not necessarily obligated to watch her child and that I'm doing her a favor. I get to live rent free in her house as payment soo, but when I was underaged my mother payed me to watch my sister cause paying me like 10 bucks was cheaper than any babysitter. I was the only option and I still am. Which is why she can't kick me out \ud83d\ude1c./j\n\nBut this lady has an alternative babysitter? You.  like your an adult that can handle keeping an eye on some tweenish boys, I really don't understand her point, this honestly sounds borderline abusive like she's just trying to control her daughter, seeing as she has no reason to actually keep her home other than because I say so, or because I'm your mother you do as I say. That's not a valid reason. Can she seriously not hang out with her for one weekend so that her daughter can have some fun and freedom? NTA. That poor girl I feel so bad, it's a tough situation for you because standing up for this girl can cause a rift between you and your girlfriend. But your not in the wrong at all.", "NTA\n\nTechnically speaking, the parent is always right and no one else should be parenting their kids and all that. But Carrie is being objectively unfair to Molly, especially by saying that Molly should ALWAYS be available to help. This is just not right. I'm sad for Molly and I don't even know her.\n\nIf you stay in this relationship, I'm fairly sure you will be exposed to more and more examples of Carrie being unfair to Molly and probably being a \"my way or the highway\" type of person in general - including to you.", "NTA\n\nBut, she\u2019s right in the fact that she\u2019s the parent.\n\nHowever, she is treating her daughter as a co-parent and that is not ok. It is not a siblings job to be ready to look after their siblings at any time. That\u2019s a parents job", "NAH. \n\nCarrie is right...these are her kids, not yours. So, all decisions are hers.\n\nHowever, \\*I\\* would not live with (or be in a relationship with) someone who treats their kids like this, or who doesn't trust me with their kids. So, \\*I\\* would tell Carrie she needs to find another place to live, and start the eviction process...whatever that is in your state.", "NTA. But next time definitely pull your GF to the side and offer privately. Speaking as a parent, it's important that you guys always present yourselves to the kids as a team.\n\n>She told me Molly needs to be ready to be responsible for her brothers at any time\n\nThis, however, is absolutely wrong. Molly is not a mother of two, she is a 16 year old girl. If she wants to babysit and agrees to do it that's great, but your GF's lack of pre-planning doesn't constitute an emergency that Molly should be forced to handle.\n\nTheir childcare needs should **Never** come at the cost of her emotional and social development.  Your GF might as well light Molly on fire to keep the boys warm.\n\nEdit: I'm no psychologist but I would think this qualifies as emotional incest, so you might consider doing some research into what that looks like.", "NTA. She\u2019s literally abusing molly.", "Anyone else a little weirded out with the age gap?", "[deleted]", "ESH, but mostly Carrie. It\u2019s totally unfair to tell Molly she can go to the party and then make her cancel just bc mom wants to go to the bar. It\u2019s not her job to drop everything and watch her little brothers when she has plans that Carrie already approved unless it\u2019s an emergency. You watching the boys seems like the perfect solution to me. Everyone gets to do what they want to do.

Sure, you probably should have piped up before the fight ensued between them, but that still doesn't make it undermining. Undermining would be if the daughter stayed to babysit, your girlfriend left, and THEN you told the daughter to run to her party behind the parent's back. If you're in a committed relationship with this woman and the plan is for it to be long term, she does need to come to terms with the fact that those children are technically your step kids and you should have the right to some discussion and solutions in a respectful way. Plus having a babysitter for a 10 and 12 year old is completely unnecessary. Hope GF isn't perpetuating sexist roles like my mom did with me and my two younger brothers...

You didn't just 'have an opinion', you jumped in while she was parenting her daughter and said yes where she said no. If you really want to be a parent, you have to be sitting down and discussing parenting philosophy outside of disagreements.

Older kids aren't parents to their siblings in the first place.\n\nI'm just very suspicious of any parent who rushes to move into their partner's home (which is YOUR home). It's not you that moved in with them, it's all of them packed inside your place. I'm questioning what was wrong with her place? Was she kicked out?", "The way she treats Molly is very serious. Molly is not her built on babysitter and at 16, should be focusing on school and having fun. Carrie sounds like an entitled ahole.", "She said the rent was going to go up near the beginning of the year, more than she could afford on her own. My mortgage is cheaper than any rentals around here, and there's room enough for all of us (3bed 2bath, the boys share) so she moved in. The kids are only here for about 1/2 of the time.", "Sorry, I was just speculating and of course don't know Carrie. Just that this isn't something that normal parents do with their minor children this early in a relationship (a year is early to move in with someone).\n\nSorry if I was thinking too hard about this", "You don't have to be sorry! I came here for outside perspectives, you're just giving me yours", "NTA. If she keeps this up she better be prepared to lose Molly when she turns 18. Teenagers need to be able to be teenagers not a 3rd parent.", "NTA, you just got between a bully and her victim", "I would kick Carrie out but allow Molly to move in as soon as she turns 18. NTA", "NTA. Your gf is treating her daughter horribly.", "Marinara flag on  the field. \n\nSo she as a mother can leave to go have fun and dump her responsibilities on a minor but her CHILD must be available to be responsible for her siblings at a moments notice(PARENTIFICATION)? There is so much to unpack but you need to talk to your GF about how she treats her daughter and why she doesn't trust you to watch her kids.\n\nSince the oldest boy is 12 and you'll already be in the house why cant she use this as an opportunity to see how responsible he is to look after the himself and the younger one.", "YTA her kids her rules\u2026 -andy", "NTA but Carrie is, it is abusive to force a child to care for other children at the expense of their own childhood. Carrie is the one who had children, they are her responsibility to watch when Molly goes out, not vice versa. She also brought the children into your home, if she doesn\u2019t like what you have to say she should leave.", "NTA.\n\n> She told me Molly needs to be ready to be responsible for her brothers at any time, since she's the oldest. \n\nAbsolutely not", "Truth. I find it very telling that at 16 Molly is going to her very first high school party. It sounds like she's been on a tight leash, maybe because mom would have been so young when she had her?", "I agree with everything you have said.", "Your girlfriend is a hobo-sexual. Someone who dates for housing.", "NTA\n\nThere's a big difference between having your kid occasionally babysit and demanding they cancel premade plans because the parents wants a night out. Carrie sounds like one of those people who thinks her children's wants are less important than hers because she's the adult. It sounds like she's probably relying on her daughter to babysit more than is fair.", "OP are you planning on having some bio kids too? Is this how you want your kids to be treated? If Molly was your kid and your wife was going out to party after promising Molly she could go other for her first party, would you be furious? Because right now you have a front row seat to how your kids will be treated and the view isn\u2019t pretty. Carrie also isn\u2019t receptive to feedback about her shitty behavior- she is a \u201cit\u2019s my way always\u201d kind of person. This isn\u2019t a great situation for you even if you don\u2019t progress in the relationship towards marriage or more kids.", "NTA. You weren't going with Carrie regardless, right? So you, a perfectly appropriate adult, will already be home no matter what. Why does Molly even need to be there, to protect them from *you*?  Oh wait, they already live with you 24/7. \n\nI think Carrie just decided she doesn't want Molly to go to the party but is too weenie to tell her why, and now she's mad at you for accidentally proving that the pretext she came up with was a crock. It's kind of rich that she's asking you to support her decision-making when *she* can't even own her decision-making.", ">Carrie snapped at me that they aren't her kids, and I pointed out that they aren't my kids but she brought them to my house, so does she expect me to not be involved in their lives or have opinions?\n\nINFO: can you clarify what you meant by this? It was at the end of your post", "Home-o-sexual.", "nta and your gf sounds controlling", "The only AH here is Carrie and I don't like her.\n\nMolly needs to live her life and boys can look after themselves for a few hours.\n\nIf Carrie is forcing her daughter to give up these very important plans, Carrie's plans must be more than going to watch \"sports\". Where is Carrie going without you that is so important? I smell a rat.", "NTA, it just sounds like the whole classic lesbian abusive relationship stuff is starting already.", "> This may be about her not wanting Molly to grow up.\n\nYeah, I definitely think this has to be the result of Carrie feeling somehow threatened by this party. OP doesn't usually go to this bar with Carrie, so OP would probably be home anyway. A 10-year-old and a 12-year-old who are already in the house with a 26-year-old don't also need a 16-year-old to affirmatively babysit them. I think Carrie just doesn't want Molly to go and  pulling some excuse out of thin air.", "I say this as a mom: this is atrocious.  Carrie has issues with women and is punishing her daughter.  Now that you stood up for Molly, expect her relationship with you to change, too.", "NTA- what your GF is doing is very unfair to her daughter and extremely sexist. Like you said Molly was at the Sam age as Tom when she started looking after her brothers but Tom is to young to look after his 10 year old brother, now that is some grade A BS. \n\nThe only thing your GF is doing is damaging her relationship with Molly and you.", "NTA your gf sure is though. Making her daughter cancel her plans so she can go out?! Expecting her daughter to be her 24/7 baby sitter is wrong!", "Nta- mollie never signed up to be a parent, Carrie did. Forcing her child to be \u201cresponsible to her brothers at any time\u201d show me that not only is she being a crappy partner to you but a crappy mom. \n\nThe fact that a bar is more important to her than a big night for her kid makes me worried she has a drinking problem.", "NTA. Everyone else has made my points l. But I've one other question you should consider - does Carrie always favour the boys? Do they get away with more than Mollie does? I know it might be hard to tell as you've only dated a year, and the age gap between the kids. But your point about the older boy being the same age as Molly when she started babysitting made me wonder. And if Carrie makes excuses like 'but Molly is more responsible', etc. Just consider that it's been because she's had no choice in the matter for at least 4 years to be the responsible one. I really hope I'm wrong but I hope her childhood hasn't been all about her brother's.", "She wanted Molly to cancel her set plans since she could go chill at the bar? \n\nThat sounds like a control issue more than a scheduling issue. There seem to be bigger problems here. Being \"ready to be responsible for her brothers at any time\" means in an emergency- not because mom also wants to go out on the same night. Molly deserves time out with her friends. She's not a teen mom and it sounds like she does plenty to help out. \n\nNormally, I'd say step-parents shod stay out of parent/child conflicts, but Molly deserves an advocate here because what her mom is doing is not right."]}
