S/O has 4 other (teen) kids.\n\nHe bought tickets to one park for all of us but said he only wants to do one park because tickets are too expensive for him to buy another days worth for everyone. \n\nHowever.. I really wanted to take my baby to two parks. I\u2019m thinking of buying a ticket and taking my baby by myself since this is the trip for *his* birthday. And he\u2019s free, so I would only have to pay for me. \n\nHis older two (18+) can buy their own tickets as they work, it\u2019s just the younger two. I feel like they have two parents who can buy their tickets for them\u2026? Or at least go half with me. I can\u2019t afford four extra tickets on my own.\n\nSo, AITA? This is my first (& only) child and since baby\u2019s birth was really traumatic for us both I really wanted to make his day special even if he can\u2019t remember it.\n\nEdit: idc if he cant remember, babies still deserve to have fun and at least have those photo memories.

I don't think this applies to your stepchildren in your head, even if you take care of them.\n\nIt is clear that you feel your baby should be prioritised over your stepchildren, and that is a big no.

OP clarified their family situation and now i know that there are not one, but two completely different families.

It includes nobody. \n\nYour kid isnt going to remeber this. It would be more fun with everyone because you could take turns with the baby and experience more.

Of which yeah the lines for those are equally ludicrous.   \n\n\nGood memories should be formed together as a whole so I would say you all decide if you want to go a second day and pick a park. If the teens want to go to a park on their own that's up to them if they buy their own tickets. TA move would be if everyone else is stuck in Downtown Disney or the hotel and you and baby are the ones walking around the park, Tbh I don't even think there is anything meant for a child that young in a majority of the parks save for maybe Animal kingdom but that would be bringing a baby to a very very expensive zoo essentially.   \n\n\nTLDR: work it out to make it possible for everyone to go to a park for a second day and you guys can scatter around the park and meet up for meals and shows if you want.

Admit it, it's fine, you are not a bad parent for wanting to go to Disney and enjoy whatever is there, nobody will judge you for that alone. You know, deep down, that the baby doesn't give a fuck about the trip and the first birthday, it's a baby, it only cares about food, sleeping and the occasional pooping. Again, this is for your own enjoyment.\n\nAlthough nobody would judge you for wanting to do Disney-ly things at Disney, if a trip to Disney WITH YOUR FAMILY was already organized logistically and financially, yes it is an AH move to add one day more to the trip, spend more money because you want to see Grogu say hello to you. Grogu will be there next year, organize the trip better then to accomodate better to your likes and your family's comfortability (mostly financially, I guess they are old enough not to go I'd they don't want to next time). That's my main reason for the judgement. \n\nOn second place, I'm not sure how popular is this, it's very hypocritical to use the poor child as an excuse to do fun things. You are allowed to have fun on your terms. But if you want to celebrate your 1yo kid's birthday in a relevant manner FOR THE KID, idk but him some cool diapers, cheaper and actually makes sense for the child. You are using your child as an excuse to make your family vacation about you and that's unfair to your family.  You are supposed to be a team with your partner and from the way you talk about his family it doesn't seem like you care that much. He is also the father of the child (I assume) and you didn't even consider letting him go to the park, you were willing to go alone.

There's nothing necessarily wrong with that but using your kid as an excuse for your desires isn't great.\n\nI think if you are all going on a family vacation to celebrate the baby then it doesn't make sense for you to leave the other kids out to go to another park.

All of these people saying they don't know why anyone would want to take a baby to Disneyland, etc. are just rambling about nothing since that's not your question and their opinion on that part doesn't matter. I took my kids to Disneyland starting at 9 months for my older and 5 months for my younger. My parents took me for the first time when I was 9 months, too. As a Los Angeles native, this is super common; most of my friends did the same since we think of DL as our local park. You know what else I did with my kids? I took them to museums, including kids' museums, to fairs, to the beach, to the snow, to restaurants, and many other places because it was a good way for them to learn to be in public. I also walked them right out of those places if they fussed or cried and they not only learned how to behave in public but I was frequently complimented on their behavior as well as thanked for removing them from the situation. Consequently, they never screamed or made a fuss on airplanes, in movie theaters (which we didn't do often, but still), at museums, or in restaurants. Ever. After one flight, people passing us as they deplaned said they hadn't even known a baby was on the flight! ***And NONE of this matters, either, because your question is whether you're an AH for wanting to take your baby to a special place for his birthday so that *you* can make a beautiful memory and the answer is an emphatic NO.*** You can spend the first day with your boyfriend and his kids at DL and then go the second day to DCA with your baby. If you're doing them on the same day, it might be trickier but perhaps your boyfriend would be willing to buy tix for his two younger kids and they can go over to DCA with you. Or, you take your baby to DCA alone at a time that you coordinate with your boyfriend and that's when he takes his kids on the bigger rides like Matterhorn, BTMRR, and Space Mountain. I think you can make it work but if his kids are pretty young and feelings are going to be hurt, I'd recommend that you consider the bigger picture. It's a lot of visual and audial stimulation for a one-year-old and you might want to do only DL with your bf and his kids and then take your son to DCA on a different day when it's just the two of you and you can spend as much time as you want in the areas that are appropriate for him and make memories on that day.
