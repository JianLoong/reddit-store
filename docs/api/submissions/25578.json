Obviously this was pretty tough, leaving the place I had lived my whole life right before my junior year. After a few weeks of me being gone, my best friend (16M at the time, like me) brought up the idea of having a shared Instagram account. We were already keeping in contact through other means but things disappear from snapchat, and videos/photos shared through text are never displayed in an aesthetically pleasing way. Instagram, on the other hand, is kind of like a digital scrapbook.\r  \n\r\n\nWe made the account and both had the login details. It was just a place for all our memories, new and old, to live. We would both usually post weekly photo dumps with obnoxiously long captions to keep each other in the loop about mundane things that may or may not come up over facetime, or old photos and videos we found. A ton would get posted when we were together, which was usually at least a month and a half out of the summer and the entirety of winter break. \r  \n\r  \nFor a long time, it was just our personal accounts following it, but we did allow some of our mutual friends to follow as well later. Most of these friends were from back home, but some from California followed after my best friend came to visit me there. This felt really cool, like having two coastal friendship groups that blended together despite the distance. Basically the account was for him, myself, and anyone who knew us BOTH well enough to get this unfiltered look at our relationship.\r  \n\r\n\nHe and I are now both 21. I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for the past eight months, and we moved in together pretty recently. My best friend surprised me for my birthday so he had been staying with us for a day out of the week he was going to spend with me when my girlfriend came to me and asked why I had a \"secret\" Instagram. Apparently the account had been recommended to her because people she follows, follow it. \r  \n\r\n\nI explained the situation and she seemed annoyed. She requested to follow it the next day, so I just ended up blocking her on the account so it would stop showing up in her recommended. She and my best friend don't really get along, so I knew he wouldn't want her following the account. Finally, he came to me and said she had come to him personally and basically demanded to follow the account while I was out getting breakfast for us. \r  \n\r\n\nThe whole thing felt very juvenile and really upset me, so I asked my girlfriend to leave for his remaining visit since she was making him uncomfortable.

She\u2019s TAH.\nAsking her to leave the apartment she lives in makes YTA.\n\nWhat you three aren\u2019t able to have a grown up conversation about this? Over an instagram account? WTF?", "ESH. You all sound almost comically immature and deeply tiresome.\n\nThe Instagram account sounds cute but I have no idea what you expected would happen when you blocked your girlfriend. Like, what was the plan there?", "Yta this really escalated and this conflict wasn\u2019t healthy. You should have left with your friend.

Under no circumstances should the person living here have to leave their own home to accomodate a guest. If the guest has an issue, they can go stay somewhere else, like a hotel.  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, she's got pretty big flaws from what I can read in this post. But you don't freaking kick someone out of their own home for like a week because your friend/guest who's staying there for free is feeling uncomfortable.", "yta it\u2019s her apartment too you have 0 right to kick her out of it jesus", "Yta. Times a million. Even if you hadn't let some of your friends follow the account, there's no reason you shouldn't have at least told her about it.\n\nBut to have any additional friends on it, and then BLOCK HER?! Are you kidding?\n\nThen you want her to leave because your friend is uncomfortable? Wtf?", "YTA - For thinking you have the right to kick her out of her own place. The two of you are serious enough that you Live together but she isn\u2019t allowed to know about a secret Instagram account? That you say Other Friends of yours follow? That is weird. Is she IN any of the pictures? You say you both do weekly photo dumps to each other\u2026since you live with her  is she in any of your photos? If so, that\u2019s also super weird and Not okay to have pictures of Her on an account she is blocked from. \n\nThis sounds like a shining example of a bunch of kids trying to play house and failing. I would suggest all three of you grow up.", "YTA\n\nShe's your gf who loved in with you.  Well if I found out my partner had another account I wouldn't be mad but I would want to be able to follow it.  But no, you blocked it?. Look, it doesn't matter if they don't like each other.  She's your girl right? Then treat her like it.   I don't even blame her for going to the friend.", "YTA.  I was leaning towards an ESH because your girlfriend does sound immature, but the blocking pushed it solidly in your court.  You could have just let her follow the account and then had a talk about why you felt the way she addressed was immature/juvenile/insert whatever here.  \n\nYou're allowed to have things with your friends and a separate relationship with them, but having a separate Instagram account that you let all your friends EXCEPT her follow is extremely weird.  You and your friend seem unhealthily co-dependent and the fact that he doesn't like her or want her to follow the account comes across as possessive.\n\nNothing screams a juvenile relationship to me like blocking your partner on social media after a fight.  It's clear you both have a ton of growing up to do.", "ESH. This shared IG account is really sweet (sorry, but that's the term that comes to mind). Your gf doesn't have to be part of it, but you know that it's going to be something that will alienate a serious partner if they can't get along with your friend. \n\nYour gf just learned that she's not as important as your friend in your life. I'm including you in the judgement only because you kicked her out of her own house. You and your friend should have left.", "Does she paid rent? If so  YTA, you are the childish one acting like some big secret as you clearly value the friend over the gf, broke up, if I were her I will only come back to pack.", "ESH, none of you can sit down and have a mature conversation?", "Everything was fine till you got to the bit where you kicked her out of her own house thats what makes YTA imo", "ESH, this all sounds very juvenile, both her actions and your response. Why did she have to leave her own appartment? Why couldn't you have had a conversation over this? Why did it need to be taken to this extreem? Why do she and your best friend not get along?", "YTA", "Childish af", "> so I asked my girlfriend to leave for his remaining visit since she was making him uncomfortable.\n\nThis is what firmly moves this into YTA territory. Ignoring everything else you kicked her out from **her home** over an unannounced guest.\n\nHer reaction over this account wasn't great but she is not a random roommate, she is your girlfriend, of course she is going to be interested in that part of your life. And don't downplay that the account isn't serious, your reactions shows that this is very serious to you.", "ESH.

Seems suspicious", "yeah seriously!!!! wtf??", "Exactly. \n\nAnd did OP just kick his girlfriend out of the apartment they were living together for his friend?\n\nWhat the heck??", "I definitely tried, because I completely agree with you. An instagram account shouldn't be causing this much turmoil. When she first asked me about it, I told her basically what I typed up here - it's an account we made when I moved away and only mutual friends of us both follow it. It's nothing serious, it's not like we vet our followers or spend much time thinking about it. I thought we would move on.\n\nMe asking her to leave was a final straw since she was making the guest we had welcomed into our place uncomfortable. Trying to intimidate someone into letting you follow an instagram account is more than a little ridiculous and isn't behavior I had seen from her before.", "Sounds like OP lit a fire on top o' a mountain and is now using the fumes to gaslight his gf.", "Lol thanks for the laugh \ud83d\ude02", "I appreciate your input. Definitely agree that I could've done a lot better in this situation. \n\nJust to clarify some things: we don't let ALL friends follow except for her. I have quite a few friends where I live who don't know him, and he has friends back home who don't know me well or at all, so they wouldn't follow us there either. It's just for our mutual friends who we know well and trust. Because she knows me but doesn't know him very well, she falls into the earlier group I mentioned.\n\nAlso, I didn't block her as some petty move. The account is private, so there would be no reason for that. I did it in hopes it would stop showing up in her 'recommended follow' section. She tried to follow the account the day after we had the conversation where I explained it, so I assumed it was still bugging her and I was trying to lessen that.", "If the account is not that serious then I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re causing big arguments over the fact she wants to follow it. Also it\u2019s not a guest she welcomed it\u2019s your guest who showed up without asking if he could be there as your post says he came and surprised you for your birthday. It\u2019s her home not his and she shouldn\u2019t be forced out of it for him", "Unless you\u2019re hiding something, not letting her follow the instagram account is childish. If she says things on the account that crosses a line then you have a conversation about it.\n\nExcluding a girlfriend from this part of your life isn\u2019t going to work long term.\n\nI mean why doesn\u2019t he like her? Why would you invite him to stay at your apartment when they don\u2019t get along? Why does she have to leave and not him? So many things you\u2019re leaving out of this story.", "To be fair, your actions make it seem like you have something to hide.", "YTA.  You forgot the critically important part where you rejected her following that account. That shouldn't have been a big deal. What's the harm in her following ?  That you wanted to keep her from seeing the account is what blew this up. \n\nHow long is left on the lease ?", "Yta. \n\nYou should get his stamp of approval for your next girlfriend since his friendship is important enough for you to KICK HER OUT OF HER OWN HOME. \n\nPlus, without him approving of the next girlfriend following the Instagram, you are likely to run into the same problem again.", "Why is it so important that you trust anyone following this account and why don't you trust your gf ?", ">If the account is not that serious then I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re causing big arguments over the fact she wants to follow it.\n\nWhen I said it's not that serious, I assumed people were getting the impression that my friend and I spend time agonizing over who follows us like it's some sort of secret club when that's not the case. Because this whole post is centered around this conflict, it makes it seem like this is a pivotal thing my life hinges or something.\n\nBut just because it's not that serious doesn't mean it isn't important to me. This is something we've had going for five years now that started during one of the hardest years I've ever had. \n\nI don't want to cause any big arguments - I specifically tried to rectify the situation peacefully through a conversation - but I also don't want to turn this thing that's positive and important to me into something negative by allowing her to follow it when she and my best friend don't get along very well. I know it would make him uncomfortable and that would put a damper on the whole thing.", "agreed op gives weird vibes and i would absolutely not be down with my long-term boyfriend having a private instagram that most of his friends follow that he posts on weekly but i wasn\u2019t allowed to follow", "Do you ever talk post about her or post pictures of her on the account?"]}
