Instagram, on the other hand, is kind of like a digital scrapbook.\r  \n\r\n\nWe made the account and both had the login details. It was just a place for all our memories, new and old, to live. We would both usually post weekly photo dumps with obnoxiously long captions to keep each other in the loop about mundane things that may or may not come up over facetime, or old photos and videos we found. A ton would get posted when we were together, which was usually at least a month and a half out of the summer and the entirety of winter break. \r  \n\r  \nFor a long time, it was just our personal accounts following it, but we did allow some of our mutual friends to follow as well later. Most of these friends were from back home, but some from California followed after my best friend came to visit me there.

My best friend surprised me for my birthday so he had been staying with us for a day out of the week he was going to spend with me when my girlfriend came to me and asked why I had a \"secret\" Instagram. Apparently the account had been recommended to her because people she follows, follow it. \r  \n\r\n\nI explained the situation and she seemed annoyed.

Finally, he came to me and said she had come to him personally and basically demanded to follow the account while I was out getting breakfast for us. \r  \n\r\n\nThe whole thing felt very juvenile and really upset me, so I asked my girlfriend to leave for his remaining visit since she was making him uncomfortable.

An instagram account shouldn't be causing this much turmoil. When she first asked me about it, I told her basically what I typed up here - it's an account we made when I moved away and only mutual friends of us both follow it. It's nothing serious, it's not like we vet our followers or spend much time thinking about it. I thought we would move on.\n\nMe asking her to leave was a final straw since she was making the guest we had welcomed into our place uncomfortable.

Definitely agree that I could've done a lot better in this situation. \n\nJust to clarify some things: we don't let ALL friends follow except for her. I have quite a few friends where I live who don't know him, and he has friends back home who don't know me well or at all, so they wouldn't follow us there either. It's just for our mutual friends who we know well and trust. Because she knows me but doesn't know him very well, she falls into the earlier group I mentioned.\n\nAlso, I didn't block her as some petty move. The account is private, so there would be no reason for that. I did it in hopes it would stop showing up in her 'recommended follow' section. She tried to follow the account the day after we had the conversation where I explained it, so I assumed it was still bugging her and I was trying to lessen that.", "If the account is not that serious then I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re causing big arguments over the fact she wants to follow it. Also it\u2019s not a guest she welcomed it\u2019s your guest who showed up without asking if he could be there as your post says he came and surprised you for your birthday. It\u2019s her home not his and she shouldn\u2019t be forced out of it for him", "Edited because I read your response about why you want the Instagram account private.\n\nThe other questions still stands though.\n\nI mean why doesn\u2019t he like her? Why would you invite him to stay at your apartment when they don\u2019t get along? Why does she have to leave and not him? So many things you\u2019re leaving out of this story.", "To be fair, your actions make it seem like you have something to hide.", "YTA.  You forgot the critically important part where you rejected her following that account. That shouldn't have been a big deal. What's the harm in her following ?  That you wanted to keep her from seeing the account is what blew this up. \n\nHow long is left on the lease ?", "Yta. \n\nYou should get his stamp of approval for your next girlfriend since his friendship is important enough for you to KICK HER OUT OF HER OWN HOME. \n\nPlus, without him approving of the next girlfriend following the Instagram, you are likely to run into the same problem again.", "Why is it so important that you trust anyone following this account and why don't you trust your gf ?", ">If the account is not that serious then I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re causing big arguments over the fact she wants to follow it.\n\nWhen I said it's not that serious, I assumed people were getting the impression that my friend and I spend time agonizing over who follows us like it's some sort of secret club when that's not the case. Because this whole post is centered around this conflict, it makes it seem like this is a pivotal thing my life hinges or something.\n\nBut just because it's not that serious doesn't mean it isn't important to me. This is something we've had going for five years now that started during one of the hardest years I've ever had. \n\nI don't want to cause any big arguments - I specifically tried to rectify the situation peacefully through a conversation - but I also don't want to turn this thing that's positive and important to me into something negative by allowing her to follow it when she and my best friend don't get along very well. I know it would make him uncomfortable and that would put a damper on the whole thing.", "agreed op gives weird vibes and i would absolutely not be down with my long-term boyfriend having a private instagram that most of his friends follow that he posts on weekly but i wasn\u2019t allowed to follow", "Do you ever talk post about her or post pictures of her on the account?", "YTA.\n\nYou would\u2019ve not been TA if you just wanted to keep the account a secret, you and your gf are two separate individuals and are entitled to keep your respective secrets.

You describe it as a memory log of your friendship, so what exactly would be the harm in showing her the page and retelling some of your favorite memories? I\u2019m willing to bet she\u2019s more curious about the account, and what gets posted there, than whether she get all-access to it. \n\nI get that it\u2019s like\u2026 the insta version of a group chat with the boys, which is why I kinda understand not wanting to let her follow it or have all access to it. Can you imagine a bro adding their girlfriend\u2019s number to the boy\u2019s line of communication, just to keep an eye on it? But like\u2026 are you not showing her the contents for a reason? I have access to my boyfriends phone, but I respect his privacy because I trust him, and the reason I trust him is because he\u2019s so open about it. If I see him texting and ask what\u2019s up, he\u2019ll have no problem recounting the whole conversation to me, he\u2019ll have no problem browsing through chats where I can see them, even with the boys, he\u2019s scrolled through snapchat memories with me right there to pull up a funny moments to show and tell me about.\n\nThere are alarm bells going off in your girlfriend\u2019s head right now because you were not open about this insta. You\u2019ve progressed this relationship to the point of living together, and though you seem post to this insta regularly and intend to continue doing so, you\u2019ve never mentioned it, it\u2019s purpose, or how important it is and why. So every time you accessed this account, you made sure she was not around to notice? That\u2019s suspicious, and then when she runs across it, you still don\u2019t show her even a glimpse of it on your own phone? You just tell her what it is and assume she\u2019ll take your explanation at face value, when, in eight months, it never once came up before? \u2018Yeah, so my best friend is so-and-so, he lives far away, but we have this insta account we share to keep in touch. We post pictures of our lives and stay updated that way.\u2019 Really never came up in any conversation about this guy? That\u2019s a really unique thing about your friendship to just\u2026 never mention, and then seem so closed off about sharing when it\u2019s stumbled upon. Again, by sharing, I don\u2019t mean letting her follow it, but the least you could do is show it to her to calm her nerves about the situation. \n\nESH because she shouldn\u2019t have brought this to your friend, but you\u2019re not doing yourself any favors by your own actions leading up to this, during this, and kicking her out of her home was absolutely disrespectful.", "Yikes this whole situation is weird. ESH.", "ESH.... I don't think you're ready for a relationship if you hide, and you did, your Instagram account from your teenage years, when you were basically a child, from your SO.

At the moment the only information she has is that it's a secret account with 2 owners. Why is it so juvenile to ask to follow a \"normal\" account. Now OP is juvenile by having a problem letting his gf see the account. He's juvenile by kicking her out of the apartment (that she possibly lives in) just to keep the two people away from each other. And it's extremely suspect that OP thinks it's reasonable and not AH-ish behavior to kick your gf out of an apartment because she asked to follow an account. No other behavior other than just *asking*", "Exactly. They all seem very, very young. Not fully cooked.", "lol", "A guest who appears to have shown up uninvited to surprise OP", "Yeah I can see that, I find this whole thing annoying so that colored my response. \n\nBut I disagree that the information she has is that it is secret. Her assuming it was secret and reacting as if it were escalated this into a confrontation that might not have happened. Why the label secret? Unless she was lied to and they colluded to keep her from knowing about it, then it isn\u2019t \u201csecret\u201d. It\u2019s unknown. There\u2019s a difference and that difference evokes different emotions.\n\nI called asking to follow it juvenile because I personally think people in romantic relationships still get to have separate friendships. It isn\u2019t necessary to be involved in everything and is some ways it isn\u2019t healthy. I could care less if my partner had an instagram account with his best friend. And if he wanted to keep it private that also wouldn\u2019t bother me because I trust him. Jealousy isn\u2019t attractive or romantic, it\u2019s possessive and controlling.", "The Instagram thing is whatever kicking her out of where she lives and I'm assuming pays rent make you the AH by far.  You and your friend go get a room together.", "What many seems to overlook it that account is between friends such can be any communication. The fact that it is a social media usually at public reach doesn\u2019t trump the right of privacy. Her being your girlfriend doesn\u2019t grant her the right to snoop on your communication. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how or why people are added. It doesn\u2019t means anyone can include themselves when it\u2019s not publicly shared. \n\nEveryone have a right to privacy. Being with someone doesn\u2019t means you also have to share every interaction you have with someone else, or access to every communication. \n\nIt is nice to exclude her? Probably not. However if you aren\u2019t confortable sharing it with her, this ain\u2019t the person for you. \n\nNTA\n\n\nEdit. Btw this isn\u2019t only your account so it is also a matter of how your bf feel comfortable including her in a convo backing up years of friendship. Also she have some learning to do about accepting when someone doesn\u2019t consent.", "The posts from our teenage years, especially right after the account started, are embarrassingly dramatic. We were both going through a really rough time so the angst and the longing were real.\n\nMost of what we post even today are things we would never show or say to acquaintances or people who weren't so close to us. It's nothing particularly scandalous, but some of my favorite videos on the account are nonsensical 3am ones.\n\nOne of the most recent videos on there is one I took of my friend eating one of those tall vanilla ice cream cones in a jokingly provocative way. Just the shit that usually lives in your snapchat memories or that some brave souls post publicly without thinking of their digital footprint.\n\nThere's also just generally deep feelings put into the captions. This is essentially a shared spam account or a \"finsta.\" It's not for everyone and just because someone is close with one person behind the account doesn't mean they get to see private moments and thoughts from the both of us.", "Is your partner in every chat group you're in?", "And you can't trust your gf to see that ?\nThat's something you should have thought more about before moving in with her.", "Provocative? This now sounds like cheating, emotionally cheating at the least.", "I\u2019m sorry but the last part doesn\u2019t make sense.  You are excluding your girlfriend from an important part of your history and friendships because it would make your friend upset knowing that she is a part of it?  Not even a part of it, just a possible observer?\n\nThis woman is in your life and if you box her out of important things, then you aren\u2019t all the way in the relationship.  If it bothers your friend so much, that\u2019s his problem and he needs to get over it.  She is definitely being weird about the whole thing but I don\u2019t blame her for being upset that you are allowing your friend to exclude her from something important to you.", "Every one that he wants to be, yes. Oh, and I told him about ALL of them.", "It's about HIM trusting her. Like I said in the comment you're replying to - there private moments of us both on the account. If he met someone new who I wasn't fond of or just wasn't close to, I wouldn't give permission for them to see my personal shit. It's just about respecting each other and the boundaries we have.", "People in relationships don't have to be in each other's friendships.\n\nI find it weird that she won't let it go. \n\nIt's important to op. They update each other about their lives here. If the friend doesn't want their life updates shared with a particular person, that's their prerogative. \n\nAs a partner, she should be accepting that he has a friend group she isn't really a part of. Is it really a big deal? I sure as shit don't want to be in every chat group my partner has with her friends.", "It\u2019s a neat idea but whatever you put on social media even if it\u2019s set to private you should consider being ok with anyone seeing.
