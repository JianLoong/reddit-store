I\u2019ve heard the words bitch ass, fucker and worse words come out of your daughters mouth and being drunk right now. I don\u2019t need parenting advice from a terrible parent.\u201d \n\nSummer then asked autumn to make me leave.

First of all, she invited you judging her parenting when she started questioning you and your partner's parenting, secondly she's letting two 13-year-old children drink alcohol, one of whom isn't even her child. That's not just shitty parenting, it's child abuse, she needs someone telling her she's a terrible parent before it's CPS that's telling her.\n\nEdit: and frankly, you kinda owe it to that child's parents to let them know that your cousin is giving them alcohol. They have a right to know and to have an opportunity to keep their child safe from her. Granted maybe they *do* know which, if so yikes, but you should make sure of it if you can.", "NTA.  Summer has a stick up her butt.  I don't know why she decided to pick a fight with you over something this stupid.  While he could have said \"please\" in that situation, it was by no means required in that context because he wasn't even asking the question; he was answering it.\n\nQ:  Does anyone want a soda?\n\nA:  Sure!\n\nHardly anyone would have said, \"Please,\" in that situation.  He did thank her afterwards, communicating the gratitude that the situation demanded.  On top of that, if Autumn had been offended, she would have immediately called him out on it.  If this is how she's always acting, I guarantee that Summer's departure from that party improved the mood.  She's the one who should be apologizing to you.  She's not just a bad parent; she's a bad cousin.", "NTA - She should mind her own business.", "So, Summer lets her 13 year-old daughter and her 13 year old boyfriend drink alcohol?\n\nIf so, you are all A H for letting that happen under your noses.\n\nRegarding the initial question NTA.

She sounds unhinged. 13 is really young in America for parents to let their children drink and typically when that happens the kids don\u2019t grow up well adjusted at all.", "NTA, good luck to the kids in this mess of a family, they\u2019re gonna need it", "I'm on the fence, so I'll say soft NTA\n\nI definitely think there was a more tactful way to say what you said. However, it's also easy for me to say that, not being in the heat of the moment.\n\nAlso, I don't really see anything wrong with the kid replying: \"sure, I'll take one\" when asked.  If Autumn hadn't asked if anyone wanted a soda and instead it was your bf's kid asking for a soda, then I think a \"please\" would be more appropriate.", "NTA, Summer is.

Technically, a \u201cplease\u201d also, but most aren\u2019t going to get bent out of shape.) But no one cared about two 13 year olds, one not even related, openly drinking until parenting insults were being thrown?", "ESH\n\nSummer is the main AH for allowing 13-year-olds to drink (this is illegal, and potentially very harmful to their development) and for inserting herself into your parenting. It's not her responsibility to parent your kids or correct your style of parenting.\n\nYou are a minor AH for telling her she is a terrible parent (which it sounds like she is). You can make this point without straight-up lashing out at her. Just get rid of the last sentence of your retort and you're good.", "ESH - You were fine up until the \"terrible parent\". Refusing advice doesn't require an evaluation of the advice giver.", "Nta but you are really focusing on the wrong part of this situation. She let two thirteen year olds drink alcohol (while swimming none the less), and then she left with them. I could be making the wrong assumption here, but was she also drinking? Really hoping she didn\u2019t drive after drinking with two drunk teenagers while no one said or did anything to stop this.", "ESH. I don't think calling her a terrible parent to her face infront of her kid was the best choice. But she kinda did it first. And I agree with you that she's a terrible parent letting two 13 yearolds drink alcohol. That's a case for the social worker.\n\nAlso, there were multiple adults involved and none of you said anything when your cousin offered alcohol to the kids?", "YTA: You took things to eleven when she started at a two.", "I think this is more of an ESH technically, as you could have handled it without insulting her like that.\n\nIf I am being honest though, I would have told her as much myself, telling you how to parent over lack of a please when her own 13 yo AND friend are drunk? Ye, I would have told her where to stick her parenting advice too...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Based on the situation you described, it seems like Summer was being hypocritical and overreacting. It's not your responsibility to parent your partner's children, and your partner's eldest was not being disrespectful by not saying \"please\" when asking for a soda.

He was NOT in any way disrespectful and there was nothing for you to correct him for.

Homeowners can sometimes be held liable for issues surrounding booze. Especially driving and minors.  And consider calling the non emergent line of the police if it happens again.

There is a reason the law says 21 and over for drinking\u2026 what if either of these kids go out while drunk and ended up dead or in danger or what if an emergency happened at the house and their too drunk to notice.

You keep excusing that it\u2019s not your house. Who cares?! There\u2019s underage drinking. Regardless of where it is or that it\u2019s \u201ccommon\u201d it\u2019s still your responsibility to alert someone about what is happening once you know it. If you don\u2019t then everything else in your post is invalid. You\u2019re just as bad at parenting as the one you\u2019re writing about. Just because they\u2019re not your kids and it\u2019s not your house is a horrible excuse no matter what!"]}
