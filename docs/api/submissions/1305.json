The role was to play one of the rich high school girls at a boarding school. The show has been filming for 2 months.\n\nThere are about 20 other girls on this show. In the past 2 months since the show was filming, I've only had three DAYS of shooting. The younger girls (the ones who just graduated high school and are 18 in real life) have been shooting 3 to 4 days a WEEK, which means in total they've gotten 9-16 days of shooting, and much more screen time than me and dollars. \n\nThere are two other \"older\" girls on set playing hs students like me (they're 25 and 26) and they've also only gotten 2 or 3 days of shooting work in the past 2 months, I confirmed it with them.\n\nAITA if I call up the casting director and complain about not getting as much work as the younger girls? I hate not being prioritzed and being put as a backburner/treated like a granny just for being 26.
