My stepsister Abby (33F) has a 2 year old daughter, Lexi, with her husband Brad (34M). Brad has a daughter, Daisy (8) that he shares with his ex. My stepbrother James (22) has a boyfriend, Carlos (25).\n\nWe are all, along with our parents, on holiday at a beach resort. Two days ago, in the evening, Abby and Brad asked me if I would babysit Daisy the next day so that they could get some much needed respite and they wanted to go into town for the day. I said absolutely not. \n\nDaisy has behaviour issues. You can\u2019t go more than an hour without her crying and screaming about something. She\u2019s extremely territorial, she doesn\u2019t seem to have any impulse control, and she never has a nice word to say about anything or anyone.\n\nAbby and Brad begged, saying they asked everyone else but they had plans. I said be that as it may, I had my own daughter to look after, and I was on my own holiday. I asked why they didn\u2019t get a babysitter from hotel staff but Brad said leaving Daisy with a babysitter always results in them getting called home early, normally because Daisy has cried so much she\u2019s made herself ill. Eventually they let it go.\n\nThe day after, I didn\u2019t hear from Abby so presumed they\u2019d found a solution. It was a quiet day and at about 3pm we returned to our suite. Shortly after we got there, there was a knock on the door. It was Daisy. She said she was bored and wanted to come in. I asked where her dad was, and it turned out Abby and Brad had gone into town and left Daisy in the room by herself with strict instructions not to go outside.\n\nI walked Daisy back to the room as I tried to get ahold of Abby and Brad but the calls kept getting rejected. I left them several messages. I was so appalled, all I was really thinking was that they absolutely didn\u2019t deserve for me to clean up this mess for them. I took Daisy down to reception and told them that her parents had left her alone in the room and I found her wandering the place unsupervised. I left her at reception as they said they would bring her down to the kid\u2019s club until they could locate Brad.\n\nWe were all due to meet for dinner at 8.30, and when Brad and Abby arrived, they berated me for reporting them to the hotel. They said Daisy would have been perfectly safe if she\u2019d just followed the rules so they weren\u2019t at fault. They also said I should have just let her stay with me until they came back. I said they deserved what they got for doing something pretty hairbrained and dangerous and it wasn\u2019t up to me to help them avoid the consequences of their actions. I told Brad he was an irresponsible parent and he should have stayed at the resort.\n\nThings are now very tense. Opinions are split within the family.

As you say, his actions needs to have consequences. But it sounds like all adults in Daisy's life are failing her. It's no wonder she acts out and throws tantrums. It's not her fault at all. It shouldn't be your responsibility, but it has to be *someone's* responsibility to help her. Since her parents are failing her, just reporting to the hotel simply isn't enough.", "NTA.

At some point Madeleine disappeared and she has never been found. That case is what came to mind when I read about them leaving Daisy alone in the hotel room because one of the theories in the McCann case is that the parents wanted rid of their daughter.

I'm not saying they should do that, they should just parent their daughter properly instead of abandoning her and blaming misbehaviour on the child. Either way they chose the worst possible option.", "Are they getting this kid any professional help?", "Then your brother will be familiar with it as well. 8 year olds don't follow rules all the time, especially bored 8 year olds with behavioural problems. I have a difficult 8 year old, and I do not believe for a moment, even on the days when I've been approaching my limits, that if I left him alone in the house or anywhere else with unlimited switch or TV time he would obey the rules given to him all day. Actually I'd give him maybe 3 hours at most. It might be worth reminding your brother of the case. Even if her parents had nothing to do with it, they left her alone and she vanished. Your brother is an idiot and you need to ask him if he could live with the idea that by leaving her alone he facilitated her disappearance should it happen. You also need to think about informing her mother of his actions. This is the sort of thing she needs to know about.

She is just as much Daisy's parent as Brad is and 100% deserves to know about this incident. He left an 8 year old with behavioural issues alone in a hotel room, full of dangers and things a kid could get up to. He left her there in the morning and didn't come back until 7pm. Then, he saw no issue with leaving her and tried to blame it on his 8 yr old for \"not behaving\". His absolute blase attitude towards leaving his young child alone for hours at a time is appalling and I'm willing to bet him leaving Daisy alone won't be a one off occasion. \n\nThe ex deserves to know of the danger her child was put in and may continue to be put in the next time Brad wants a break from his kid & can't find a sitter.", "You absolutely need to let Daisy's mother know what her father did.", "My son is special needs and had behavioural issues at Daisys age.

I\u2019m the only person in his family he feels comfortable being himself with as I never made him feel \u2018wrong\u2019 for having additional needs. \n\nNow the family members who spent my sons childhood rejecting him for being difficult are angry that my son is no contact with them and they said they\u2019re happy to take him out for the day because now he\u2019s easy to handle. My sons view is, if they couldn\u2019t love him when he was a child, they don\u2019t get to love him now there\u2019s no effort on their part, to love him. \n\nMy son has built his own family with me and his friends and none of us find his special needs unlovable. \n\nDaisy will remember every one of these rejections from every person who has spent her life rejecting her. She\u2019s a child that requires extra patience, care and attention. She won\u2019t be a child forever but she will remember the treatment she received, forever.

I don\u2019t even know her last name.
