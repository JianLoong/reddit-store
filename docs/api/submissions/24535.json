My stepsister Abby (33F) has a 2 year old daughter, Lexi, with her husband Brad (34M). Brad has a daughter, Daisy (8) that he shares with his ex. My stepbrother James (22) has a boyfriend, Carlos (25).\n\nWe are all, along with our parents, on holiday at a beach resort. Two days ago, in the evening, Abby and Brad asked me if I would babysit Daisy the next day so that they could get some much needed respite and they wanted to go into town for the day. I said absolutely not. \n\nDaisy has behaviour issues. You can\u2019t go more than an hour without her crying and screaming about something. She\u2019s extremely territorial, she doesn\u2019t seem to have any impulse control, and she never has a nice word to say about anything or anyone.\n\nAbby and Brad begged, saying they asked everyone else but they had plans. I said be that as it may, I had my own daughter to look after, and I was on my own holiday. I asked why they didn\u2019t get a babysitter from hotel staff but Brad said leaving Daisy with a babysitter always results in them getting called home early, normally because Daisy has cried so much she\u2019s made herself ill. Eventually they let it go.\n\nThe day after, I didn\u2019t hear from Abby so presumed they\u2019d found a solution. It was a quiet day and at about 3pm we returned to our suite. Shortly after we got there, there was a knock on the door. It was Daisy. She said she was bored and wanted to come in. I asked where her dad was, and it turned out Abby and Brad had gone into town and left Daisy in the room by herself with strict instructions not to go outside.\n\nI walked Daisy back to the room as I tried to get ahold of Abby and Brad but the calls kept getting rejected. I left them several messages. I was so appalled, all I was really thinking was that they absolutely didn\u2019t deserve for me to clean up this mess for them. I took Daisy down to reception and told them that her parents had left her alone in the room and I found her wandering the place unsupervised. I left her at reception as they said they would bring her down to the kid\u2019s club until they could locate Brad.\n\nWe were all due to meet for dinner at 8.30, and when Brad and Abby arrived, they berated me for reporting them to the hotel. They said Daisy would have been perfectly safe if she\u2019d just followed the rules so they weren\u2019t at fault. They also said I should have just let her stay with me until they came back. I said they deserved what they got for doing something pretty hairbrained and dangerous and it wasn\u2019t up to me to help them avoid the consequences of their actions. I told Brad he was an irresponsible parent and he should have stayed at the resort.\n\nThings are now very tense. Opinions are split within the family. AITA for what I did?\n\nEdit - I\u2019ve seen a couple of people saying my family are nuts for thinking what Abby and Brad did was okay. No one thinks that. Parents think I was an AH for reporting them instead of just keeping Daisy with me. They agree what Brad and Abby did wasn\u2019t right.\n\nEdit 2 - for everyone wondering where Lexi was, Abby and Brad took her out with them.", "created_utc": 1691918304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pu9oh/aita_for_reporting_to_the_hotel_that_my_bil_left/", "score": 2275, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is an idiot and you need to ask him if he could live with the idea that by leaving her alone he facilitated her disappearance should it happen.

That is more scary to me then leaving a kid in a room, although that is also wrong. Where was their 2yr old in all of this? Why couldn\u2019t they take the oldest daughter too?

They're lucky you didn't report them to CPS instead of the hotel staff.", "Jesus. No wonder this kid has issues.", "NTA. They should honestly be happy that they didn\u2019t get reported to the police by the hotel. It\u2019s all on them. If your parents think you should\u2019ve kept daisy why didn\u2019t they volunteer their services to watch her?

Nope they brought the kids they can either make arrangements for them or actually watch them themselves.", "Why did you make this the hotel\u2019s problem? Yes Abby and Brad are AH\u2019s. They are more than that, they are unfit parents. There were 6 other adult members of your family present at that resort.

Therefore, as the supposedly responsible adults in their minor child's life, they ARE \"at fault.\" \n\nShe was literally wandering the halls alone! Anything could have happened to her!  You were right to take her to hotel staff when you couldn't reach her parents. You had already declined the job of babysitter.  NTA", "I'm going against the grain and saying you're all assholes here. Relative to your giant asshole in laws your assholery is easy to overlook - but you still count.\n\nDaisy needs someone to stick up for her, obviously. It's fine you don't want to be that person, she's not your \"problem\" right? but you did a pretty good job adding to her myriad developing problems with the way you summarily handed her off to hotel staff like a complete stranger who's stumbled across an abandoned piece of luggage. She's old enough to notice these things and it's this kind of experience that's going to help shape her concept of your extended family and her place in it. \n\nYour family were also assholes to the hotel staff who had to deal with the situation when they've got their actual jobs to do. Again, you didn't start it, it's totally the parents' fault, but next in line to put their own shit aside and manage those parents' abject neglect of the poor kid is not in fact the staff in a hotel.

An 8 year old shouldn't behave that way. It's a classic case of \"fear my parents will abandon me\". \n\n\nAlso, I would have reported them too. That's child abandonment and dangerous for the child.\n\nNTA. Those guys needed a reality check", "NTA. Here is the thing: they took her sister with them but left her behind.

Wtf", "By your tone I can tell you\u2019re something nasty YTA", "I mean obviously leaving a child this young unsupervised, especially away from home is completely irresponsible and would result in possibly losing parental rights in my country.

And you painted such a dreadful picture of Daisy  and yet she was fine to stay alone for many hours and then to be in hotel's care.

You're all assholes.", "NTA and what you said is correct. They had a responsibility and they left an 8 year old alone in her room. It's appalling. I think that reporting him to the hotel was a little dicey insomuch as it meant Daisy could have been put in a frightening situation, but she was put into a safe situation and her parents had to face consequences.

That child is not yours and therefore not your responsibility to ANY degree. If my partner and i want to go somewhere that we can't bring our son, we ask family to keep him. If no one can, WE DONT GO. He is our son and our responsibility if that means one of us have to be at his side 24/7 until he's old enough to be left alone (12 years old here) then so be it.

Even if kids are troublesome, they need to feel wanted and kept safe.", "NTA!  I can understand why Daisy has behavior issues.  What a way to tell a child she's not loved or cared for than by taking your youngest daughter out with you while on vacation and leaving your other child alone, in a hotel room.\n\nI think it's the best thing you did to bring her to the hotel desk.

I don\u2019t understand why no one else said this.", "That\u2019s my thought too.  Daisy knows her parents are separate, her dad has a new child with a different person, and every adult she knows rejects her.  How do they expect her to behave?  I feel sorry for Daisy.

Kids these days mostly don't have that kind of lifestyle, a lot of times because parents can and do get in some serious shit for the kinds of things parents from my day got away with. A seven year old riding a bike alone all through town/at the beach all day/into the night? That would have been negligence now. Kids can't even walk to a park by themselves/be in a backyard fenced in without constant supervision without being called on for abuse/neglect.\n\nSo an eight year old in 2023 is a wildly more unsuitable child to be left to their own devices than an eight year old from 1987. (Barring kids born on like, family farms or places where they're born into the same sort of 'you work with your family' type of mentality).", "\u201cBrad is an idiot, not a psycho.\u201d  \n\n\nAnd yet the outcome for his child will be exactly the same, regardless.", "Lack of empathy and impulsive behavior are symptoms of psychopathy. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No they are taken immediately all the time", "What plans of yours were so important that you couldn't watch her from 3 to whenever her parents got back / family dinner??", "It's honestly a red flag the childcare staff didn't.", "You need to report them.\n\nIf this is what he does when family are around, who knows what he does when they are not. \n\nHer behaviour is that of an abused child. \n\nPlease call social services.", "No, this is neglect.", "Yes, at least in my country, the United States, the biggest barrier to children gaining independent life skills is the judgement of others.\n\nThat's why I'm an advocate for free range parenting. If there is cultural shift so that teaching kids to be independent, more parents will feel comfortable giving children that freedom.", "It's a slippery balancing act. There's kids that get parentified by parents that 'need help' with their other kids to the point they hand over actual parenting to the oldest of the gaggle. Then there's kids that are babied. There's kids that have to get jobs at 12 to help with the family, and then there's 'kids' at 30 that are still getting handouts from their parents. \n\nI'm in Canada and it's not that different here than the states. But I wish there was more independence allowed without instantly having it be called negligence/abuse.", "You could look into psychopathy, narcissism, and antisocial personality disorder to see if you see any indicators.", "CPS or equivalent should be called though. What they did was seriously neglectful and dangerous, and I doubt it\u2019s the first or last time they will abandon this little girl.", "No therapist would report separation anxiety. \"Mandatory reporter\" means reporting signs of possible physical or sexual abuse, or self-harm or threatened harm toward others, not anxiety.", "I think you misunderstood - they wouldn't report the separation anxiety itself, but if it were caused by being neglected and left alone like this often, which would likely come out in therapy, *that* is something that would have to be reported."]}
