My stepsister Abby (33F) has a 2 year old daughter, Lexi, with her husband Brad (34M). Brad has a daughter, Daisy (8) that he shares with his ex. My stepbrother James (22) has a boyfriend, Carlos (25).\n\nWe are all, along with our parents, on holiday at a beach resort. Two days ago, in the evening, Abby and Brad asked me if I would babysit Daisy the next day so that they could get some much needed respite and they wanted to go into town for the day. I said absolutely not. \n\nDaisy has behaviour issues. You can\u2019t go more than an hour without her crying and screaming about something. She\u2019s extremely territorial, she doesn\u2019t seem to have any impulse control, and she never has a nice word to say about anything or anyone.\n\nAbby and Brad begged, saying they asked everyone else but they had plans. I said be that as it may, I had my own daughter to look after, and I was on my own holiday. I asked why they didn\u2019t get a babysitter from hotel staff but Brad said leaving Daisy with a babysitter always results in them getting called home early, normally because Daisy has cried so much she\u2019s made herself ill. Eventually they let it go.\n\nThe day after, I didn\u2019t hear from Abby so presumed they\u2019d found a solution. It was a quiet day and at about 3pm we returned to our suite. Shortly after we got there, there was a knock on the door. It was Daisy. She said she was bored and wanted to come in. I asked where her dad was, and it turned out Abby and Brad had gone into town and left Daisy in the room by herself with strict instructions not to go outside.\n\nI walked Daisy back to the room as I tried to get ahold of Abby and Brad but the calls kept getting rejected. I left them several messages. I was so appalled, all I was really thinking was that they absolutely didn\u2019t deserve for me to clean up this mess for them. I took Daisy down to reception and told them that her parents had left her alone in the room and I found her wandering the place unsupervised. I left her at reception as they said they would bring her down to the kid\u2019s club until they could locate Brad.\n\nWe were all due to meet for dinner at 8.30, and when Brad and Abby arrived, they berated me for reporting them to the hotel. They said Daisy would have been perfectly safe if she\u2019d just followed the rules so they weren\u2019t at fault. They also said I should have just let her stay with me until they came back. I said they deserved what they got for doing something pretty hairbrained and dangerous and it wasn\u2019t up to me to help them avoid the consequences of their actions. I told Brad he was an irresponsible parent and he should have stayed at the resort.\n\nThings are now very tense. Opinions are split within the family. AITA for what I did?\n\nEdit - I\u2019ve seen a couple of people saying my family are nuts for thinking what Abby and Brad did was okay. No one thinks that. Parents think I was an AH for reporting them instead of just keeping Daisy with me. They agree what Brad and Abby did wasn\u2019t right.", "created_utc": 1691918304, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pu9oh/aita_for_reporting_to_the_hotel_that_my_bil_left/", "score": 717, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That case is what came to mind when I read about them leaving Daisy alone in the hotel room because one of the theories in the McCann case is that the parents wanted rid of their daughter.

Actually I'd give him maybe 3 hours at most. It might be worth reminding your brother of the case. Even if her parents had nothing to do with it, they left her alone and she vanished. Your brother is an idiot and you need to ask him if he could live with the idea that by leaving her alone he facilitated her disappearance should it happen. You also need to think about informing her mother of his actions. This is the sort of thing she needs to know about.

If anything, these parents should be grounded from the family for the day for what they did. Beyond temporary embarrassment, are there really any reprocussions for what they've done? And has anyone spoken with Daisy seperately? Did your family explain to her why you did this or that coming to family sooner was OK when such an inappropriate situation was created? I hope you at least explained to her during this walk down that you're not punishing her for coming to you when she should have, that what she did is absolutely ok, and that this is about her parents behavior.  \n\nClearly, she needs people in her corner with these 2 and possibly her mother.

No-one wants HER, she is neglected in favour of their \"real kid\".", "I think once they saw I was calling back to back they realised and thought \u201cwell the jig is up anyway we\u2019ll just deal with it when we get back\u201d", "I\u2019m sorry, the heck does this have to do with me being emotionally mature? Brad\u2019s poor judgement means *I\u2019m* a bad person?\n\nOkay if you think I shouldn\u2019t have reported them but I didn\u2019t see a better option. Brad\u2019s parenting or lack thereof don\u2019t have anything to do with me.", "Exactly.", "Is Daisy seeing a child psychologist for her separation anxiety? Because extra TA to them if they are not engaged in treatment.", "[removed]", "It mortified me to read that.  Madelienne McCann's parents also decided to leave their daughter in a hotel room.  \n\nWhat consolation would telling her to follow the rules have been for the two assholes in this post if Daisy had been led away while outside the room?", "I don't understand what you mean?", "OP said their phone was on, they were just declining her calls but wouldn't decline from the hotel (because there would be consequences).", "\"Brad is an idiot, not a psycho.\" Are you sure OP? Because from here it looks very strongly like he is both.", "Would make it much easier for an opportunist to slip in and grab her if they see that the father isn't even checking in. Just the idea of leaving a child unsupervised for an hour or two when away from home is horrifying to me", "Heading to trial for something else. There's still not enough evidence for anything regarding the McCann case.", "I haven't kept up with it as much the past couple of years. As I said, they were theories nothing more and it does not absolve OPs brother of his own stupidity", "She absolutely needs to know for Daisy\u2019s sake", "Put those stiff manners away for a minute. If you were the mother in question, wouldn\u2019t you want to know what was happening to your daughter??", "Nothing can- in fact it makes it worse", "Until Abby and brad get it that they are responsible for her. When Abby decided to get with man who already had a child. That they can\u2019t abandon said child just because she is acting up. I highly doubt she would leave her child alone for 5 plus hours in a foreign country so she can sight see", "She\u2019s a member of your family that needs help and is unable to help herself. She\u2019s been crying out for help and all of you can\u2019t be bothered to help her. You have all stood by and let your brother punish your niece because she has additional needs that none of you are addressing and none of you have any interest in addressing because to address them would require you to care.\n\nI\u2019m not angry you reported your brother. I\u2019m angry at every one of you adults for not helping a helpless child. You don\u2019t need to be her parent to care, you just need to have a heart.", "She came to you lonely and bored looking for companionship and you turfed her out to the reception staff. Disgraceful. A child and you sent her away. At that point, you became the AH too.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Does she need a psychologist though? She\u2019s only eight and it\u2019s quite normal to be tearful/shy for some children at that age if left with strangers or people they don\u2019t know that well. Parents just have to deal with it until the child outgrows it, that\u2019s part of parenting.", "I was just thinking that for the next family get together, they can have a movie night and watch some true crime and documentaries about Madeline McCann", "They also drugged all the kids too to stay asleep", "Well, you can never be sure, can you. Even Ted Bundy was a good boyfriend. So, no I\u2019m not sure but that\u2019s not been my experience of him.", "They\u2019re not going to get it. So it\u2019s a waste.", "Had I kept her with me, Abby and Brad would have thought that it is okay to do the same thing over and over because I will always save them from any consequences. Then suddenly I\u2019m the emergency babysitter for a kid who has kicked me, bitten me, and can\u2019t be kept from crying for more than 45 minutes at a time. All while I also have a young child. No. Im sorry but no.", "It's normal for 3-5 year-olds to still be struggling with things like that. \n\nIt's normal for 8 year-olds to have problems when they have to stay overnight with other people, and maybe a babysitter if they've never done that before. But I wouldn't say it's normal to struggle with just being left at a club/with relatives/with other kids for a few hours. After all, she really should be used to school and family by that age!", "Being tearful/shy is one thing. Crying until she makes herself sick, screaming, and being such a brat that adults call her parents nearly 100% of the time seems a tad more concerning to me, and possibly worth a trip or two to a therapist.", "Wow. This girl is gonna end up so f'd up because no one will try to protect her.", "Your parents need to sit Brad down and explain that children with behavioural needs, need to be parented too. He can\u2019t just pick and choose which children he is prepared to be a father to and he doesn\u2019t get to opt out of parenting because parenting Daisy is hard work. \n\nYour brother needs to get a GP referral to child services for an assessment and he needs to get Daisy a referral to an occupational therapist. Your niece needs an adult to be her advocate. If you, her aunt, don\u2019t want to advocate for her needs and well-being, talk to your parents, Daisys grandparents. One of you needs to help this child get the medical help she desperately needs.\n\nYour brother also needs to speak to Daisys senco at school and ask them to refer her to the community social worker and community paediatrician. There is so much help for Daisy to address her behavioural problems but Daisy can\u2019t ask for that help. She needs the adults in her family to access that help and support. \n\nIf no adult in your nieces family want to help her access the medical and professional assessments and treatments she needs, I\u2019ll do it. Like I said, I\u2019m in England. I know from addressing my own son\u2019s additional needs, how to navigate child services and occupational therapy. \n\nJust somebody help this child.", "Its possible she *has* outgrown the issues but her parents haven't upgraded their mindset. If they last tried 2-3 years ago and it just kept happening, they might have just internalized and accepted they can't leave her with sitters, and just just stopped trying even tho she's 8 now and they can.", "Yeah, OP mentions multiple behavioral issues that don\u2019t sound like the parents are addressing. She needs a behavioral assessment. She could have ADHD, or some other diagnosis that therapy and medication could do wonders for her.", "Brad isn\u2019t my brother, he\u2019s my brother in law. Abby is my stepsister. My parents would not feel that it\u2019s appropriate to be having that kind of conversation with Brad.\n\nBetween Brad and his ex, Daisy has seen four psychologists, none of whom have diagnosed Daisy with any kind of additional needs.", "Brad needs the GP to refer her to child services. They diagnose conditions and disorders. Occupational therapists will work with Brad and Daisy on therapy and coping strategies.\n\nIt\u2019s not appropriate to abandon a child and walk away and yet here Daisy is with no one finding her well-being something to be concerned about."]}
