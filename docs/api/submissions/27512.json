This guy was trying to humiliate you, rather than just enjoying his own wedding. No doubt he was trying to \u201cput you in your place\u201d because you\u2019d done some time.", "NTA. People saying ESH are delusional. He stepped to you, aired out your business to a stranger, and put his arm around you which is a violation of personal space. The fact that it was his or his bride's special day didn't occur to him when he went out of his way to pick a fight with you, did it? Your sister can defend his bullying but it won't be long before she's a victim of it herself. See if she still adheres to that \"just let him say what he wants\" mentality. In fact, it sounds like he already did take it out on her and now she's pushing it back on you. \n\nI will say, you will want to build some thicker skin and learn to shrug off his taunts. This is going to be a messy marriage and you don't want to be their scapegoat.", "NTA, your BIL is.", "ESH except your sister who had to deal with this on her wedding day.", "NTA. Guy sounds like a prick and you don't need to put up with that shit.", "Definitely NTA. He's TA for deliberately ruining the wedding for his wife and everyone else there. He owes you an apology, as well as all the other guests! Mortifying.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister needs to grow a backbone and stick up for her family. especially if she knows that the two of you have some history and the brother's causing some bullshit. So what? The brother is an CO and that makes it okay for whoever? Fuck outta here.", "NTA . Austin was being an AH and was prolly trying to ruin any chance you had with Lily.", "The only reason your being downvoted here is because you said you did time, garuntee if you left that part out everyone would be like no totally not the asshole! funny how the hive mind works around this joint ( no pun intended there), Definitely NTA dude was being a dick causing trouble and trying to put you down. So what if you did time, you did it got out and your moving on, you dont need to be reminded of this every 5 minutes especially by a screw who will always look down on you when most of them are more corrupt and do worse shit then most of the prisoners there meant to look after.", "NTA", "You are the AH for not punching him in the nose. What your BIL did was reprehensible! What a friggin jerk. There was no need for him to say anything and then rubbing it in. Your sister is an idiot if she doesn\u2019t reign him in.", "NTA\n\nAnd do you see marinara flags all around your sister. I see an abusive CO who like to stir shit just because he can. I'd bet you aren't the only one that he stirs the pot with. I'll bet this is a nearly daily reaction by him. And I'd speak to your sister on the side and ask her. She will deny it probably. But ask her what would be her line in the sand that would make her walk away from an abusive husband, If he isn't a problem then it doesn't matter what the line is since \"he won't do it\" So she has no  excuse to actually draw a line. Insist upon her having a line. B4 it becomes a \"dead\"line. or a hospital line.", "BIL was the AH, definitely patronising, definitely wanted to ruin a good thing you had going with lily. Now whilst the overarching event of a wedding shouldn\u2019t give him immunity to criticism, the problem is your sister deserved to have that no matter what your BIL did (up to and including the AH behaviour he demonstrated).\n\nYour reaction is completely normal and warranted, if this was in any other event I would say you have 0 responsibility to control your reaction, a punch to the face for BIL would have been warranted medicine imo.\n\nYet here, at your sisters wedding, for the wish of her to have the two most important men in her lives appear to get along would have meant more to her than anything else. You let your anger for your BIL (which was understandable) surpass the love for your sister.\n\nYou could have taken it on the chin, and bring it up to her in private after the wedding, but by the sounds of your BIL, you might be there in a couple of years as a shoulder to cry on if her marriage to this AH doesn\u2019t work out. If that does happen, don\u2019t feel vindicated by the disdain you already felt for him and remind your sister you told him he wan an AH.
