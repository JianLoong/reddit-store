For the purpose of this only two are currently relevant. Let us call them Taylor(17F) and Riki(21F). The other three are still young, so they don't factor in yet. \n\nTo begin this, my parents got divorced when I was very young. My only full sibling is Riki, the rest are half siblings with three of them (the unnamed siblings) being on my mother's side and Taylor being on my dad's side. When Riki entered college I had already acquired a well-paying job and, due to my family on my mother's side being poor due to too many mouths to feed and a crippling spending addiction by my mother, Riki was unable to pay for college. She worked extremely hard in school and got multiple scholarships that covered around 85% of her tuition.   \n\n\nSo, beings that I was doing well, I supported her through college. I gave her a monthly stipend to pay for groceries as well as helped her with gas money whenever she needed. In addition, I paid for her rent a few times as she was short. Please note that she did take out loans as well, but she used them to pay for the remainder of her tuition, books, etc. I gave her that money with the stipulation that she maintains a 3.5 GPA average, which she did. She graduated a year early with Magna Cum Laude or Sigma Cum Laude. Honestly, don't know the difference.\n\nSo, here is where I might be the A-hole. Taylor is going to college next year and she texted me asking how much per month I would be giving her. A bit of background: Taylor's mother absolutely hates Riki and I. From the moment Taylor was born she made it clear that Taylor was her priority and we weren't worth her time. Multiple times she forgot about birthdays or Christmas with the excuse, \"You have two families, your mother can be the one to buy you presents.\" Please note that while my mother is an N-mom, she was always sure to treat Riki and my other three siblings fairly. Didn't really care that I was excluded since I look just like her ex-husband.   \n\n\nOnto the rest: the influence of Taylor's mom and her attitude towards myself very quickly rubbed off on her and she has been absolutely horrible to me since she could talk. An example of this would be slapping me across the face at a family dinner because I was getting food for my fiancee and refused to get her a plate. Needless to say, her mother insists I was in the wrong. That's the sort of thing I dealt with all the time, and still do.\n\nSo, I texted her back and told her that I wouldn't be sending her any money. Then, being petty, I texted her mother, \"She has one family, you can pay for her college.\"\n\nThat has started a whole storm of nonsense and has culminated in Taylor's mom making Riki cry and demanding that Riki take out loans to help Taylor in college. \n\nRiki is begging me to just give her some money to stop the fighting, but I refuse. I don't really care for Taylor, and I feel like this is just rewarding bad behavior. So, Reddit, please judge me. Am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, you don't owe them anything", "Is Taylor a good student?  Gotten any scholarships?  You may have a way around the entire issue.  If she can't maintain a high GPA and graduate in the same amount of time as Riki, then the deal is off.  Make a contract.  She has to pay back the money if she doesn't meet the terms.\n\nThat said, I don't think you should pay because when will it stop?  There are also three younger kids.  Will you be expected to pay for them also?", "NTA. You have a poor relationship with Taylor and her mom so it shouldn't be a surprise that you aren't helping her. \n\nThe only question now is what you plan on doing for your other half siblings. You could say that if you help  Taylor, you'll have to help the three other half siblings and you can't afford that so the bank of half-brother is closed. Or you could say you are saving for the other half siblings and can't afford to help Taylor.\n\nPlease let Riki know she's under no obligation to help Taylor. She needs to be working on setting up a firm foundation for her future.\n\nWhere's your dad in all of this?", "Really? No.  I would not help either. Let her take out loans etc.  stay firm and don\u2019t give out. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. Cut them off. Also Riki may have heart of gold but at a certain point people only treat you the way you allow them to treat you. Riki needs to learn to stand up for herself rather than be bullied and taken advantage of.", "Why would they ask Riki to take out loans for Taylor? How does that even make sense?", "Dad is currently calling to threaten me with physical violence, as well as leading the emotional blackmail against Riki. He sees nothing wrong with blatant favoritism, so long as it's in Taylor's favor.", "Would love to, but I get the feeling that being even more petty at this point is the wrong way to go. Unfortunately Riki is something of a heart-on-her-sleeve type person. it's hard for her to tell people no.", "Oh, not at all. He's called to physically harm me a few times if I don't give Taylor money. He sees nothing wrong with the blatant favoritism, He's also one of the principal leads behind emotionally blackmailing Riki.", "Believe it or not, that's among the more tame side of things that she's done. She once got a hold of an antique coin collection I had from my grandfather and used it as pocket change. Among those coins was a misprinted quarter. The slap was just the tip of the ice berg. And none of it was punished.", "I feel like that sentence should have ended at \u201cthey\u2019d be instantly cut!\u201d", "I know for a fact my step mother was the one who came up with the idea, she's alluded to how I need to start a college fund for Taylor multiple times since she heard that I was helping Riki. I ignored it at the time because I didn't think it would come to this. My dumb mistake.", "The sad thing is she's already been talking to me with the conversations being along the lines of, \"I have a job now, I can probably help her, right?\" And then followed by me vehemently opposing it. I'm worried she will end up caving. Trying to figure out how to avoid that atm.", "With your comment you actually vote YTA.", "That's fair, but I am 99% sure that Taylor's mom was the motive behind the text to begin with.", "Taylor is not at all a good student, hovers around a 2.5 GPA or so. Not bashing people with that GPA, but she also doesn't try for scholarships or anything. Hasn't applied for any, researched them, etc. Riki was researching grants and scholarships pretty much since day 1 of High school. The three younger kids on my mothers side don't expect the same thing I gave Riki. But realistically I would help them. Two of them have maintained a 4.0 thus far in high school and the third wants to go to trade school.", "My other 3 half siblings are all on my mothers side, and they're excellent students. 2 have a 4.0 thus far in high school and the third wants to go to a trade school(welding, I think?). I would help them, because they are putting forth effort in getting scholarships and such. Maybe that makes me a bad person, helping all but the one?", "I think its them trying to force my hand and give Taylor financial support but I can't be certain.", "Save all evidence of his threats and report him to the police.", "Report that, get a restraining order.", "Wow, OP, that really sucks. If possible, you and Riki need to get the hell away from these people. It seems like she is your only real family", "At this point petty may be the only way to go.", "Threaten to physically harm me, I should say.", "Jesus - get yourself and Riki away from these ghouls.  Permanently.", "Let Taylor know you were planning on selling your antique coin collection to pay for her college!", "Yikes. Nobody deserves that, and you definitely don\u2019t owe her anything based on your post!", "Yeah, probably the more likely reaction", "Please, please help Riki to develop a spine and get her to stop paying for *anything* for Taylor. See if you can get Riki into therapy so that she can learn how to be strong and say no to the emotional manipulation and guilt-tripping.", "I would remind her all the shit u guys went through, explain how much it all damaged you, and she giving to their demands is saying that everything that they did is ok. She will be giving a free pass for them to keep shitting on you. It's not something that's in the past ur half sister slapped u in the face after u were already grown-up. That is totally not ok. Ur sister WBTA if she gives the money.", "Gotcha, I fixed it, I thought asking a question with ? was more of a statement he was not.", "What would be most helpful to your Riki?  This is clearly stressing her out.  You mentioned counseling.  In the meantime, what can you do to help her?  Ask her if setting the same standards for Taylor that you did for her would be okay.  That way, it's fair across the board and you're not denying anyone anything.  Whether or not Taylor can meet those standards will be on her.", "I don't see the point of rewarding someone for being abusive to you. You can draw whatever lines you want if you are willing to deal with the fallout. \n\nAre Taylor's grades good? Nothing says you have to give a significant amount to Taylor and given there are 3 other children involved (and she's been an AH to you all her life), it's reasonable that her help, if any, would be limited.\n\nEven if Taylor and her mom  treat you better in the next year, you'd probably still know it's because they want access to your money.", "Would absolutely *love* to, but I am from a small town and the chief of police is, quite literally, my father's best friend. Best man at his wedding(both of them) type friendship. Nothing would happen.", "I want to, very much so. But Riki is very much more wanting to stay in contact with the family and she, for lack of better wording, is very much susceptible to emotional manipulation. She has a big heart.", "I think so too, but Riki has repeatedly begged me not to provoke them any more than I already have. If I wasn't sure that she was on this sub, I would post the screenshots of the conversations.", "Trying very very hard to. I had something of a clean break, haven't spoken to them until this whole thing flared up. But Riki is really easily manipulated by them.", "Oh that's evil, I love it. Have an award.", "I am trying so very hard to. But she can see the good in just about anything even if there is none to see. But therapy is a good idea, I'll run it by her to see what she thinks. Thanks for that.", "To be honest if I was in ur place I would feel a little betrayed by my sis if she end up givingthe money", "For people who read it, it is. But for the bot and people who just scroll, it is not :D", "Yikes. Get the eff away as soon as humanly possible. Do you have a home and enough resources separate from them? \n\nAnd, now that Riki has graduated, does she have a job and home separate from them as well?", "NTA. You are being emotionally blackmailed and the toxic family is targeting Riki as an emotional hostage. Your best move here is to go no-contact for a significant period of time. You can start limited contact again down the line. If it degrades to toxicity increase the no-contact period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for threats of violence, record everything. Perhaps contact a lawyer for an initial consultation about protecting yourself and Riki.", "Im fully set with a house and completely independent finances. The moment that Riki graduated I helped her get into an apartment as well as become financially independent. Which, sadly, they've taken advantage of by asking her to take Taylor on 'sister bonding experiences' which translates to take Taylor to get manicured and all that nonsense on Riki's dime.", "You both have everything you need to cut these literal abusers who would ruin your futures without a second thought out of your lives. Do it.\n\nDo what you can to empower Riki to make the decisive change too. But, if you've tried to a reasonable degree and Riki is still unable or unwilling to, you may need to let her face and realise their toxicity for herself instead of setting yourself on fire to keep her warm. They can't see that using Riki to get to you works, not even once."]}
