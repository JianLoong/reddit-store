You don't have to invite someone you don't like to your party, but you also shouldn't expect her SO to attend without her. It's a good thing he called and clarified the situation before the party, or it REALLY would have been awkward.", "YTA, not for not wanting to invite Ariana, but for not understanding that couples are generally a package deal. Choosing to go to your party when you\u2019re excluding Ariana is Rob choosing you over her, which he\u2019s not going to do", "Rob has already spoken for himself. Why are you asking AITA to second guess his decision? He chose not to come to your party because you excluded his GF. No amount of internet strangers validating your decision can alter the outcome. But FWIW, yes, YTA excluding half of an established couple doesn\u2019t tend to go well.", "YTA \u2026 although could understand why many people might say N.A.H.\n\nFirst and foremost, by not inviting your friend\u2019s girlfriend, you are effectively forcing your friend to choose between his friendship with you and his girlfriend \u2026 he apparently chose correctly.\n\nSecond \u2026 when you first extended the invite to him to come to the party, you should have made it clear that his girlfriend WASN\u2019T invited \u2026 instead, they (reasonably) thought they had plans for the Saturday before Halloween and then found out the night before about her exclusion.\n\nThink you better assume that your move effectively killed the friendship.", "You say \"Also it got worse when me and Ariana got into an argument a year ago during my Halloween party that led us to REALLY disliking each other.\"\n\nThat's pretty damn vague. Was she completely in the wrong? Was it a clash of personalities? Or were you in the wrong?\n\nTo be honest though, even if you provide more context on that, I'm still leaning towards ***YTA***. Will other friends at this party be allowed to bring their long term partners? If the answer is yes, then Rob should be able to as well. What happens if you get married in a few years, and they're still together? Is Rob not going to get a plus one to your wedding, because you're still bitter about some stupid Halloween party?\n\nGood on Rob for sticking up for his girlfriend!", "YTA, I wouldn't want to go to a party that was actively excluding my partner either. \nIt's fine to have separate friend groups and activities but if they've been invited every other year and then you're all of a sudden like \"lol no not her, only you,\" of course they won't want to come.", "I can't understand how you didn't foresee these exact results.  It really isn't very difficult to get along with someone with a different personality; you simply give them a lot of space.  It seems like there is some reason that you dislike Ariana.  Are you sure that you aren't jealous?", "YTA for putting your friend in a position expecting him to pick you over his own girlfriend. For the sake of your friendship, find a common interest with the girlfriend or learn to ignore what annoys you about her or accept that your friendship to Rob has ran its course.", "YTA - You can invite whomever you want to your party but you must be pretty naive to not have seen this outcome. If you keep putting your friend in these situations, you may not like the outcome. \n\nGiven your main complaint is that she\u2019s \u201cgirly and chatty\u201d\u2026 you sound like you\u2019re just bitter and jealous of Ariana.", "Yup, YTA.", "YTA.  You are that stereotype girl people hate.", "YTA.\n\nto be clear it's not because you didn't invite her. If you don't want to invite somebody, nobody is forcing you to.\n\nit's because somehow you think you have the right to be *angry* at someone because they chose to not attend a party where you have specifically excluded their SO. if you told me I wasn't allowed to bring my gf, I would choose not to attend as well, and you would have zero right to be angry with me for that decision.", "YTA. Your goal here was to have your friend attend your party and separate him from his S.O. It would have been polite, caring, and respectful to your friend to invite both or neither. You created unnecessary conflict and possibly messed up the both of them from accepting other invitations because of the miscommunication.", "YTA. obviously. did you really think he would choose you? you arent the one\u2026satisfying him. he\u2019s going to choose his girlfriend, lol. as he should. when you\u2019re in a relationship, that\u2019s your partner. you don\u2019t choose to go to a party they aren\u2019t invited to. you\u2019re naive if you thought he would. you sound jealous and like you have more than friend feelings for this dude.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a random party, it was for a once a year event. If your friend has been with Ariana for 2 years, it makes sense he\u2019d want to be with her.", "YTA. Of course you are not obligated to invite anyone that you don't want to invite. However, your friend was doing what he felt was right in his relationship and you should respect that. A 2 year relationship sounds like he may be pretty committed to her so you might want to consider trying to be more friendly with the gf or else understand that things like this will probably continue to happen.", "YTA. Doesn't sound to me that she's done anything unforgivable enough, to warrant exclusion. You've just had a clash of personalities, and some conflict as a result. So it's not very mature to exclude her. \n\nAnd I absolutely believe you played a huge part in the 'personality clashes', just from your attitude re: Rob not attending. You SERIOUSLY expected him to tell his SO on a holiday, that she was excluded from the usual celebrations. And that she could stay at home for the night, on her own, whilst he and everyone else are celebrating (at the very place that excluded her). It's like you wanted her to feel marginalised and alone - and send her a catty message, that you're more important to her boyfriend than her feelings. \n\nThen you were actually surprised when HE decided for himself, that wasn't appropriate. Good for him. It sounds like you're playing petty 'power games' in excluding just her, and are trying to drive a wedge between them. This is all very immature for 25 - it's more like mean girl high school behaviour. You think you're Queen Bee, because you throw a Halloween party, it seems. Good for him, for not letting you use him as a way to 'punish' her. \n\nI do also wonder if you have a thing for him. It's just weird you think you and your party should be more important to him, than his SO's feelings. It's like you're competing. Whatever's going on here, however, it's all very immature of you.", "YTA.  If you have yet to discover that throughout your life there are going to be people you don't like, but you should be civil and polite to them regardless, you are in for a rough time.  Other people have said that you can invite whoever you want to your party.  But that really isn't true.  Just like when you were a child and had a birthday party you could not have invited every kid in your class except the one you didn't like.  (Well maybe you did and that is your problem now.)  \n\nAnd you also have to realize that as you get older and people pair off into couples, there are certain situations where you can't expect them to be willing to ditch each other.  They get to decide - not you - when they are a package deal.  And for social events like a party, they are usually going to be a package deal.  So if you want to continue seeing your friend at your parties you have to grow up and be mature enough to deal briefly and pleasantly with someone you don't particularly like.\n\nSo you have a party with 20 or 30 people.  Be honest, how much time would you have to actually spend with his girlfriend?  You could have met them at the door, said \"Hello, so glad you could make it - help yourself to drinks.\" And then moved on.  Sometime during the evening you could probably catch your friend alone for 5 or 10 minutes to catch up.  Then say \"Bye. Great to see you. Thanks for coming\"  when they left.  Would that have killed you?", "I wouldn't say you're an AH per se, but it was naive. Of course he's not going somewhere his serious girlfriend isn't invited. If I were you, I'd have sucked it up for a night if you really wanted your friend there. You don't have to like her, but she is part of his life, and they are a package deal.", "NAH borderline YTA. \nYou aren't obligated to invite someone you don't like to your party, but it is rude to exclude long term significant others from an invite. \nYour friend isn't obligated to go to a party his girlfriend is excluded from. Either you need to learn to forgive and include his girlfriend or you will lose him as a friend. Btw there's nothing wrong with being \"girly and chatty.\" Calling someone \"too much\" sounds like a you issue.", "YTA\nYou can invite anyone you like, but you had to of known the boyfriend would take it as an insult if you didn\u2019t invite his girlfriend. No surprise that he doesn\u2019t want to come now.\n\nThis comment \"I asked if she really couldn\u2019t be alone for one night.\" puts it into AH territory in my view. his response was perfect and told you everything you needed to know about why what you did was wrong.\n\n(ETA more thoughts)", "YTA.\n\nI am a very sociable person. I've hosted and attended more parties and what not than 4 if your most socialable friends will in their lifetimes combined. Halloween is an inclusive party holiday. When you invite Stephanie you're also getting Steve and when you invite Steve you are getting Stephanie. When you invite Jessica and she shows up with her 3 besties it's not only okay, it's expected.  It's a party, FFS.", "YTA. Unless she trashed your house last year or did something truly awful and inappropriate, you don\u2019t exclude your friends\u2019 partners. You don\u2019t have to be BFFs with them, but if you want your friends to stick around, you\u2019re polite to their partners. That\u2019s what mature adults do.", "YTA", "Yta", "Well you are NTA for not inviting her, but YTA asshole for not accepting the consequences of that.\n\nYou are free to choose Who is allowed In your party, and he on the otherhand is free to choose to not attend. \n\nI dont really care about what happened between you nd ariana, but if you *really* cant be In the same room with her, its time for you to say goodbye to your oldest friend.", "NAH. You don\u2019t like the gf so you didn\u2019t invite her. He chose to be with his gf instead of attending a party she wasn\u2019t invited to. It may just be that your friendship is diverging, which happens to the best of friendships.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your post gave off real 'pick me' vibes. :-/", "YTA you can decide who to invite, and they also can choose not to come. Easy as that.", "She wanted him to pick her over his girl friend. Which is ridiculous. Sounds like he was her back up plan. Someone to hangout with until she found someone better, until then, she should be his number 1.", "But they\u2019re just best friends, she doesn\u2019t want him, she just doesn\u2019t want him to have someone else so he can want her/s", "Yeah no.\n\nThat rule only extends to partners.

Why would you be surprised thst he wouldn't cone without his gf? The fact you did makes your motives suspect.\n\nHe seems like a decent boyfriend who sided with his long term SO. You seem like someone who had a stupid expectation. Is there a deeper reason? I hate assuming things, it happens way too much on AITA. If you really wanted your friend there you would have set aside your dislike of his gf. It is your choice who you invite but actions gave consequences. The consequence if yours should have been easy to predict.\n\nAs some Redditors are fond of saying play stupid games and win stupid prizes. And you did. YTA for thinking he would still come. Don't expect the friendship to continue.", "A well reasoned idea. I felt her actions were suspect in some way. Kicking myself for not thinking of this."]}
