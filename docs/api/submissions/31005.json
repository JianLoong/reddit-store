I\u2019m also invisibly disabled (autoimmune disorder plus a genetic disorder that exacerbate each other).  My MIL made a couple snide remarks when his parents came to help us move in together, because she thought I was being lazy.  When I told my husband, he took his mother aside and explained that I was not helping on doctor\u2019s orders, because in my prior 2 moves, I\u2019d gotten injured.  It\u2019s pretty normal to expect each partner to handle their own problem relatives, or at least be the primary person handling them.", "NTA.

This being said, after reading all of your responses to other postings, it's apparent he doesn't doubt your illness whatsoever for him to do everything in support of helping you.  However, one thing that's not mentioned is have you asked him how he's holding up in all of this?  Yes he's helped taking you to doctors appointments, to the hospital, pharmacy runs, change of clothes, and keeping a stock of vomit bags in the car.  Yes caregiver burnout is rampant and maybe he isn't defending you as vehemently as he should, but if they are overbearing as they appear to be, he's likely just saving the energy he has to keep supporting you.  I suffer from RA, only gotten worse and seeing my mother go through it I'll avoid relying on others until it's absolutely impossible.

It's clear he doesn't agree with them because if he genuinely thought you were lazy and faking your illness, I assume he wouldn't be with you.
