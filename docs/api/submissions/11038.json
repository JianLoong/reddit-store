{"id": 11038, "submission_id": "11cxlds", "title": "AITA for throwing my brother a baby shower and taking away from the Mother to be?", "selftext": "I (29F) have a brother, Mike (35M) who is expecting a baby with his soon-to-be ex-wife, Amber (30F).  Mike and Amber met because Amber and I were best friends in high school.  They started dating when she returned from college 8 years ago and they have been married for the last 5 years.  Amber is 6 months pregnant and about 6 weeks ago my brother discovered her affair.  \n\nShe claimed it started after she discovered she was pregnant and is over but my brother demanded a paternity test, which she did hoping it would save the marriage.  Ultimately, Mike opted for divorce anyway but has not filed yet because he wants to wait until the baby is born to make sure he retains his parental rights and so they can work out a parenting plan.  She thinks it is because he is having second thoughts about the divorce. I do not hate Amber and understand she will be my nibling's mother and will be in our lives forever.\n\nSo now to the issue at hand, their (co-ed) baby shower was planned for the end of March and it is making for a very awkward situation.  Everyone knows they are getting divorced and why and she has lost a lot of friends over this since my brother is a really good guy and well-liked.  I was helping her mother plan the party since she was my best friend and he is my brother but now a lot of friends and family do not want to attend the (joint) shower.  \n\nI told her mom I would host our family that weekend since we have so many that are coming in from out of town.  We have a really big family and they love to celebrate so we have relatives flying in for the weekend, including our sister.  Now many of their friends want to attend my party (which is fine with me) and her mother has received many cancellations. I do feel bad for her and her mom and now her mom is calling me the AH and thinks I could have picked a different day (I can\u2019t because so many family members have already made arrangements). \n\nIt\u2019s also not about the gifts but my brother is going to need supplies for the baby as well and my family doesn\u2019t feel comfortable gifting them to mom knowing that dad will then have nothing. Her mother also feels like I am taking the gifts from her daughter and the baby but I feel like if the gifts go to the dad, the baby benefits just as much as if the mom were to get them. \n\nMy husband thinks a \u201cman shower,\u201d as he is calling it, could be seen as petty but doesn\u2019t think it makes me an asshole for doing it.  My family and friends are very excited to celebrate my brother and the new addition and are grateful they don\u2019t have to awkwardly attend a shower with her there.

Your brother will be a new dad and he deserves a shower and support and baby gear as much as any mother.", "NTA. The baby will probably move from one parent's house to the other, so each parent needs a set of supplies. And after everything your brother has been through, it will be a nice, positive event for him.", "NTA. Fuck Amber and the affair partner she rode in on.", "Going with NTA because this marriage is all but officially/legally over. Mike as a divorced dad will need plenty of equipment,  furniture and supplies for the baby. At a joint shower he would be seen as a heel if he started taking gifts or splitting gifts because too many would think only the mom should benefit from the joint shower. By having his own daddy diaper/baby shower then it's clear to everyone in attendance and even those not that any gifts will be going home with him for the child and his home alone.", "NTA.\n\nMen and women are expected to parent equally these days. No one would care if the mother held an birth shower, independent of the father's involvement, due to what is going on between them, they shouldn't care now.", "NTA - Showering your brother with gifts is love in action; that is the core of what the family is doing. This can help him heal from the infidelity and strengthen him to secure parental rights.  This birth is deeply important to him.  It does not matter what other's think of a 'man shower' -- Love on!

I don't love that she is upset with me because we have always gotten along well and it was really nice that my SIL's family and my family got along so well.  I'm so shocked that this is even happening that I am questioning my own actions  because I hate seeing people I love hurting.", "Yes. It's an extra special woman who has unprotected sex with her husband at the same time she's cheating.", "Paternity test was already performed\u2026he is the dad. Affair partner also confirmed the affair started after the baby was conceived.", "Yes, everyone is aware. Once my brother found out he told our whole family and she had to confess to hers. It has been devastating to her mom and dad and I think that might be why they are taking it out on me.", "Like why am I throwing a shower for my brother? Because my whole family is planning on attending a baby shower for this baby and they honestly do not want to attend a shower with her there and then have her talk all the gifts that they buy and either cause a situation where my brother has to fight for these items or buy new ones so he can stock his home with baby supplies that he will need since they will be splitting custody.", "I get that! Yet, none of this is on you. This all comes down to your ex sil messing up in the worst way. You're just dealing with the blow back -- and that's honestly not fair to you or your family.", "It is hard to see the people you love hurting. But it wasn\u2019t because of your actions. Your brother was hurting before your baby shower (and plan making) because his wife cheated. His wife is now hurting because he doesn\u2019t want to be with her because of HER cheating. And MIL is hurting because her daughter doesn\u2019t get all the attention because her son in law wants to divorce her daughter because of HER cheating. See how it all circles back to her? That is not your fault and you shouldn\u2019t make it your problem. I really love you are taking care of your brother like this. That is sweet. And I hope you can maintain a relationship with the mother of the baby/ SIL and her mother because that would be best for your nibling.", "She is the child's mother, this is you & your family's life for a minimum of 18 years. You can't do this for every event, without causing stress to the child & their relationships & it should start with the shower. \n\nYes, she cheated. Yes, she sucks. But that's secondary now to the child's needs & you're starting off on a very bad footing.", "I am not the the parent, that is for them to work out and a major event like a first birthday is more than a year away. Right now everything is very raw and everyone is still in shock. I couldn\u2019t imagine sitting in a room with both families together pretending all is right in the world. What are they supposed to do, open gifts together and be like \u201coh, WE can\u2019t wait to use this with baby\u201d knowing that there isn\u2019t a WE anymore? \n\nA shower tends to focus of the parents-to-be since the baby is not there yet. If they decide to co-parent peacefully, they can take the lead on that when wounds start to heal. My brother is trying to set boundaries with her right now since she is convinced that he will change ks mind. Holding the shower together would reinforce this for her and that can cause harm too.", "The child will have two households, but will likely spend the majority of time with the mother for the first year, particularly if being breast fed. \n\nHaving written that, both households will require all types of things for the child. \n\nIf there is only one baby shower, the one the MIL is planning, many people may not give anything. Anything that is given, rather than being split, would be kept by MIL and the mother of the baby. This would leave the father with nothing.\n\nBy having two baby showers, those that would not give gifts, due to the mothers affair, may well give items to the father.\n\nThat way, at least the father will not need to buy everything, and if there are gifts that would be more useful to the mother, perhaps the father might give them to her - as they are for the child\u2019s use.", "There is a \"we\", the child's parents. Whether they have 50/50 custody or not, they'll be co-parenting and being a member of the family you have a part to play in that. \n\nI just think this is the wrong thing to have done, you're setting your families up in opposition & I think it'll cause problems down the line."]}
