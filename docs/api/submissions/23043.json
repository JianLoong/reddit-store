Unfortunately, she had a miscarriage around 10 weeks. When my son called me on the phone, I was so shocked that I just blurted out, \u201cWhy? Did she fall?\u201d\n\nShe did not fall, by the way. I didn\u2019t realize I was on speakers during that call and my daughter-in-law overheard my reaction. \n\nWhen she got pregnant again, they didn\u2019t announce until well into the second trimester. Due to my daughter-in-law ending in a very unexpected C-section, my son requested my help to come over. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry for them, washed the baby, etc. Despite all my hard work, she was still very cold towards me and treated me rather poorly. I finally asked her why and she admitted that she was furious when I sounded \u201cvery blaming\u201d when I asked if she fell that\u2019s why her previous pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. \n\nI told her that I asked if she fell not to blame her in any sense but out of concern for her. I said that I am aware there are other reasons that miscarriages occur as members of my immediate family have suffered the same. I was very sad to hear the news. All of us were so happy, excited about her first pregnancy then next day heard the sad news. We all called to speak to her directly and see how she was but were told she was not ready to speak. We tried to give the space and time she needed for the situation.\n\nI don\u2019t think she believed me though. \n\nAITA for asking if my daughter-in-law fell that\u2019s why she had a miscarriage?", "created_utc": 1690227453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158kmvg/aita_for_asking_if_my_daughterinlaw_fell_when_i/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There doesn't have to be a \"reason\" or \"event\", it can just be a non-viable pregnancy.  Now that you know this you can refrain in future from trying to pin down a reason, lessening the danger of making an already grieving person feel blamed.", "Info - why was your first assumption that she fell?", "I mean, that's a pretty tone-deaf thing to say right when learning the news. You could have asked if she was okay or something. You know, like a person.", "First of all, I can see how you were asking this out of concern for your daughter-in-law. But as someone who has suffered multiple miscarriages, when people are trying to find a reason for your loss, it feels like they are blaming you. Very few miscarriages are due to a traumatic event like a fall. Most simply occur because the embryo is not viable or developing properly. She will likely never know the reason for her loss and that will haunt her. Regardless of your intentions, you hurt her feelings during one of the most painful and agonizing moments of her life. You unknowingly compounded on her pain, and she deserves a sincere apology for that.", "YTA\n\nYou were told she miscarried and your first words were why?  \n\nHere is a tip for you.  When someone gives you some big news, traumatic news, something obviously huge in their lives, it it perfectly acceptable and preferable to take a small deep breath and small pause - this is where you think about what to say in stead of spewing out the first thing that pops into your head.", "Yta.  This is one of those situations where you need to tuck your tail and profusely apologize.  Not because you had any bad intentions but because this situation is so painful that it just doesn't matter.  Pride doesn't have a place here.  Don't make excuses don't apologize through your son- speak to her directly, genuinely and lovingly.  \"I am sorry i said something hurtful during a terrible time in your life and there is nothing I can do to reverse that stupid remark- just please know I realize how insensitive it was and wish I could.\"", "YTA. Miscarriages happen a lot more than people realize due to a variety of things, not just from something physical.\n\nWhen you asked if she fell, you basically put the blame on her like it was her fault. You could have asked ANYTHING other than that in that moment. \"Is she okay? Is there anything I could do to help? I'm so sorry!\" would have been much better.", "Question - have you ever actually apologized for that being your first reaction? If not, do so ASAP. Either way, YTA for this being the very first question out of your mouth after hearing about her miscarriage.", "I think a \"I'm sorry, I just blurted it out, it was thoughtless.  I know nothing was your fault. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel worse\" would have gone long way to smoothing things over.", "Very soft YTA. You obviously didn't mean to hurt or blame her, but in the aftermath of a miscarriage she must have been feeling *so* raw and vulnerable, and possibly wondering to herself whether she did something to cause it. Even if it was your initial reaction to ask 'why,' you should have taken a beat and thought carefully before you said anything other than 'I'm so sorry.'", "YTA. \n\nThere is such a deep amount of shame when women lose a baby (unwarranted, yes, but it\u2019s there). To ask if she fell is so immensely insensitive as it suggests she herself was at fault. \n\nAre you unaware that miscarriages are super common? Why would you assume she fell? Not only do I think your response is assholey, I think it\u2019s just really peculiar\ud83e\udd14\n\nIt might take her some time to feel comfy around you. Pregnancy, motherhood, loss- these are things that are so tremendously connected to a person\u2019s sense of self and womanhood and you don\u2019t mess with that. Hopefully this may guide how you respond to such news in the future.", "I want to say NAH. Your response was unhelpful to say the least but it wasn't said out of spite. You also didn't know you were on loudspeaker which suggests to me that if you did know your daughter in law was on the line, you may have reacted differently.\n\nBut you do need to repair the damage with her. You need to accept that you hurt her feelings and that it is on you to make things right.", "YTA\n\u201c Despite all my hard work, she was still very cold towards me and treated me rather poorly.\u201d\n\nYea. Also, AYFKM with that take?! Because that seems to show you just expect her to get over it because\u2026you did some chores. \n\nYou said something that gutted her and seem more defenvie than remorseful about it. You may not have intended to be hurtful but wow, you stepped in it and you need to find the words to have a hard conversation and own up to it.", "YTA. You don't need to know why anyone miscarried, nor do you need to ask any questions AT ALL. Just say you're sorry and ask how you can help.", "Wait that was your first reaction? Did she fall? \n\num yes YTA its very tone deaf. \n\nAnyone would first respond with a heart breaking \"I'm sorry\" or \"is she okay? are you both okay?\" not \"did she fall?\"", "You gave her a long explanation instead of the appropriate apology when she expressed how hurt/insulted she was by what you said. You still owe her an apology.", "YTA \n\nYour intentions don\u2019t seem to be malicious but the response wasn\u2019t OK either", "YTA. You basically asked \u201cWhy, what did she do?\u201d\n\nLearn to hold your tongue. You\u2019re a grown adult.", "Lol. The majority of miscarriages are from genetic abnormalities of the embryo, not the mother falling. YTA.", "YTA. You were looking for a reason, it didn't sound like concern. Concern would have sounded like:\n\n\"On no. I'm so sorry. :( Is daughter-in-law okay? Can I do anything to help?\"\n\nNot: \"Why? Did she fall?\"\n\nIt sounded like you basically implied \"why, what did she do?\" Not okay. Don't be so nosey about \"why\", ask if she's okay. Be there. Talk about details later if necessary. \n\nIf she did fall, he would have told you.", "Op have you actually apologised to her? No matter your intentions your words caused her a lot of pain. She\u2019s not going to forgive you because of your justifications. You need to say you\u2019re sorry and actually be sorry.", "Yikes.  YTA.  I understand that shock can make us say weird things, but seriously, your very first thought was to essentially blame her for losing her child?  Doesn\u2019t matter that it wasn\u2019t your intention, that is what you said.", "NAH. You made a mistake.", "Soft YTA. It was a reaction but by god it was the wrong one.", "YTA. Falling would be the least likely cause for a miscarriage at 10 weeks. Clearly your tone made her feel as though she had done something wrong, while, it wasn\u2019t intentional, it\u2019s what she perceived. I think your best bet is to continue to try to make it up to her by explaining what an idiot you are, and that you blurted out the first thing that came to your mind. You may have to say that a lot to make her believe it.", "YTA\n\nIt definitely sounds like you thought that she caused the miscarriage. And if you haven't apologized, you are doubly TA.", "NAH\n\nA lot of pregnancies end in miscarriage during the first trimester. It\u2019s normal to be shocked and ask blurt out why when we hear shocking and painful news. I don\u2019t think we should be judged by how we react to react to hearing surprising and painful news. It is also very normal to feel a sense of ownership or fault when miscarrying. Just have a conversation about how you didn\u2019t mean to hint that it could have been her fault in any way, which it sounds like you did.", "NAH\n\nYeah, you did mess up with your reaction. It's pretty obvious that you meant zero harm, though\n\n...problem is, logic and reason go out the window when it comes to trauma and loss. The combination of physical and psychological impact on her, means that she had every right to be hurt by your kneejerk question\n\nYou're doing the right thing in supporting her. She will see that you care through your actions. That is all you can ask", "YTA. Falling is probably the least common reason for early miscarriage. If my MIL said that to me, I\u2019d assume she\u2019s trying to find a reason to blame me.  \n\nSure it was nice of you to care for them after her c-section, but that doesn\u2019t make you a hero or vindicated. she doesn\u2019t owe you forgiveness for saying something so cold and out of pocket during something so traumatic. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re in their lives still. If I were her, you\u2019d be no contact.", "YTA. It was not your place to guess why a miscarriage occurred. Your place was to express your grief and sorrow and extend assistance and comfort. People say things in the spur of the moment but what makes you the AH here is your inability to see your DIL\u2019s discomfort and apologize to her. Miscarriages happen, sometimes due to a direct event and sometimes due to just\u2026nature and biology.", "YTA\u2026.the first thing you thought when you found out she miscarried was to basically ask if it was because of something she did. You are obviously old enough to know better than that.", "Yta don't ask", "\u201cWhy? Did she fall?\u201d\n\nThat is probably one of the most mind boggling things I've heard in reaction to that situation.  I'm not trying to be insulting.  But wow.  I mean we can't always control what comes out of our mouth's.  But that was a dumb one to define dumb ones.\n\nAnd if you say something stupid, well it's not that far fetched that someone will take it the wrong way.  That you didn't \"mean it like that\".  You put your foot in your mouth and we can't just pretend that didn't happen, well meaning or not.\n\n\"When she got pregnant again, they didn\u2019t announce until well into the second trimester.\"\n\nThat's common.  We lost two and by the third we kept it very close to the chest.  It felt like we were holding our breath until he was born.  So that probably has little to do with you and your ability to say dumb things.  But I can't imagine it helped.\n\nYTA\n\nI don't know what to say.  You said something incredibly dumb and they took that and were offended.  You can throw your hands up in the air all you want as if it was helpless or you can humble yourself and just admit you said something incredibly stupid.  See it from her point of view instead of just wanting it to go away and giving excuses.", "YTA. \n\nSometimes people put their foot in their mouth. I think you\u2019re aware it was a shitty thing to say. The appropriate thing to do would be to apologize, and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. She has every right to be upset, because you seemingly never acknowledged that what you said sucked. \n\nThe fact that you got on Reddit and asked if you\u2019re an asshole, is what makes you the asshole.", "You are the AH. Your first thought shouldn\u2019t be \u201cWHY\u201d it should be \u201cis she ok?\u201d", "YTA. Seriously?", "YTA. Asking if she fell implies that she caused the miscarriage. I don\u2019t blame her for being cold towards you, she feels you blame her for the first miscarriage. You have a long road ahead of you to gain her trust back.", "YTA i would be absolutely heartbroken and furious if my father in law blamed me for a miscarriage. And that\u2019s me sitting here without the grief of the loss and the hormones running rampant. God i hope you sincerely apologised and grovelled for doing that to her at possibly the worst time of her life.", "yup YTA. your knee jerk reaction was to try to blame her for a completely common occurrence and the fact that your instinct wasn't to inquire about your daughter in law's well being or her health speaks volumes.", "YTA\n \nAccept data offered with no inquiry just support. When or if the parents are ready to offer more information you hear more. You may never hear anything.", "YTA. That was an ignorant comment. Sometimes miscarriages happen for a certain reasons and sometimes they just happen for no reason at all. Instead of explaining yourself, just apologize. Admit that you out your foot in your mouth and you realize you poured salt in a very open wound. Maybe you can get her something nice like a gift certificate to a spa to accompany your apology.", "YTA", "YTA. That question was way out of line. My interpretation is \u201cyou must of lost the baby by being negligent and therefore she was responsible for it passing\u201d your question is an outright blaming her for losing the baby.\n\nDo you not understand how cruel that was. Heck, she is much nicer than I would be. I would tell my husband, your son, that Hell would freeze over before you would be allowed anywhere near me or my babies. \n\nOn the insensitive scale of your question 1 out of 10 with 10 being totally inappropriate, you reached a 20 for me. \n\nWhat is even worse, is your clueless attitude about it. Or maybe that snarky question is really meant to hurt her mentally and emotionally. And that makes it evil, and you as well. \n\nEvidently, you have no fondness of your DIL. And that is something you need to fix. It is a you problem. Please seek therapy, and face reality that your son has grown up and you are not his priority in life anymore. That his wife is his number one now. And isn\u2019t that wonderful. Find a hobby to get over it. \n\nAfter therapy, if you can accept her with love, find a way to beg her for forgiveness for your way out of line inappropriate behavior and that you want to start a new with accepting her. And treat her how you would want your daughter that you truly love and would expect her in-laws to accept her. If you cannot, please walk away. She deserves better than you. \n\nShe holds the key to your son forever loving you as a son, and a key to her children\u2019s hearts in allowing you in her life.

And go No Contact with you.\n\nAnd I\u2019m in my 60s with 8 grandchildren, and three lost in miscarriages. Not once did I ever ask my DILs how did it happen.

When my DILs talks about the ones they lost, I let them.", "Yes, YTA", "YTA, not for blurting out what you did -  it was an emotional response and I get it. You weren't trying to blame, you were concerned. Unfortunately, that's not how it was taken.\n\nBut YTA, because when she explained it to you, you should have said \"yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful with my words in the future.\"", "NAH, could have phrased it better, but intent matters, no asshole here.", "NTA There's no script in real life.", "YTA\n\n\"Why?\" Isn't a decent first reaction when  told of a pregnancy loss. It's always going to sound like you're trying to assign blame and \"why\" doesn't matter in that moment. \n\n You should actually be quite embarrassed that your first thoughts & first words weren't \"Oh, Honey,  I am so sorry!\" ,\"Is Jennifer OK?\" and \"How can I help?\" , not necessarily in that order.\n\nYour daughter in law heard implied criticism at probably the absolute lowest, most vulnerable moment of her life.  Not condolences,  not concern,  just \"how did she cause this\".\n\nYour intent isn't relevant,  the impact is.", "I'm expecting to be downvoted to oblivion but I'm gonna go with NAH only because your intentions were good. You asked out of concern for her as opposed to blaming her, which I think a lot of people are overlooking. You should still apologize and give her the time and space she needs to heal, but I also don't blame her for being hurt by that comment.

In none of that did you actually apologize for your comment.", "YTA, maybe learn to think before you speak. That was some next level miscarriage-blaming, whether you realized it or not. Jfc, I can't believe you are so clueless you had to go to an AITA forum to figure this one out.....", "YTA. Why doesn\u2019t matter.

Idk why mother in laws think they need to know the reasons for miscarriages. Like someone said 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. I had a miscarriage and went to my obgyn appt with my mother in law. ( I don\u2019t remember exactly why but I am guessing she wanted to tag along). My mother in law kept asking the NP why I had a miscarriage. For me, it made it sound like she wanted to blame me. The NP got very uncomfortable and kept explaining sometimes miscarriages happen without any reason.", "The issue here is intent vs. effect. Your question added to your daughter-in-law's grief.

I didn\u2019t realize I was on speakers during that call and my daughter-in-law overheard my reaction. \n\nWhen she got pregnant again, they didn\u2019t announce until well into the second trimester. Due to my daughter-in-law ending in a very unexpected C-section, my son requested my help to come over. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry for them, washed the baby, etc. Despite all my hard work, she was still very cold towards me and treated me rather poorly. I finally asked her why and she admitted that she was furious when I sounded \u201cvery blaming\u201d when I asked if she fell that\u2019s why her previous pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. \n\nI told her that I asked if she fell not to blame her in any sense but out of concern for her. I said that I am aware there are other reasons that miscarriages occur as members of my immediate family have suffered the same. I was very sad to hear the news. All of us were so happy, excited about her first pregnancy then next day heard the sad news. We all called to speak to her directly and see how she was, but were told she was not ready to speak. We tried to give the space and time she needed for the situation.\n\nI don\u2019t think she believed me though. \n\nAITA for asking if my daughter-in-law fell that\u2019s why she had a miscarriage?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: At any time, such as after she told you why she was upset, did you apologize to her for saying that? Something like, \"DIL, I am so sorry for what I said. I was shocked and upset and did not mean to imply you were at fault and will not say anything like that in the future.\"", "The intent was concern but the impact was that she felt you were insinuating that it was her fault. YTA\nThe only way to make it up to her is to show you trust her with your actions.", "Very soft YTA in my opinion. You talked without thinking, it happens, but it was still very hurtful for them.", "YTA, but not maliciously so. I get that it was just one of those things you blurt out, but implying that your DIL somehow caused the miscarriage, even by accident, was just not a good move. It\u2019s just way too sensitive a topic, plus your DIL was likely still dealing with the physical aftermath and had little energy to deal with a comment like that. (I know someone who still remembers an insensitive comment her in-laws made almost 40 years ago about a loss, even though she\u2019s long since forgiven them and knows they weren\u2019t trying to hurt her.)\n\nI\u2019d apologize, sincerely, without trying to defend yourself, and just be sensitive going forward.", "I think people need to let others know they're on speaker. Not because they may say something about another person but because they may be sharing personal details about themselves.", "YTA.\n\nI can totally buy you blurted out the first thing that came to mind - but if there was no malicious intent, I think you need to think hard and examine why that was the first thing that you thought of. \n\nEither way, your intention means little when someone is hurt. If you step on someone\u2019s toe you apologise, yes? Same principle. Offer a sincere apology, not an explanation.", "You're not an AH, you're just an idiot. We all say stupid things from time to time. Just learn from it and move on.", "YTA. But gently.  You weren't thinking,  it just came out.  It was hurtful, but just admit you were wrong,  sincerely apologize and learn for the future.", "Yes.  It's none of your damn business.", "Yes.  It's none of your damn business.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou didn't mean any malice, but it was a tone deaf and really out of touch thing to say. \n\nI think most younger women know miscarriages can just happen for no reason, so to hear a close relative say that at a sensitive time, it would feel like the person saying it is sort of looking for a reason to blame. \n\nI hope you can patch things up!", "Unfortunately, YTA here. The intent doesn't really matter because it's how it landed in this situation that matters. You said what you said and now it's up to your daughter in law to decide if she's able to move past it. Hopefully you learn something from this experience and you'll be more mindful if you ever find yourself in a similar situation.", "You blamed her for her miscarriage, something that was not her fault, and you haven't made an attempt at meaningful amends.\n\nApologize. You were a massive, massive AH and you've damaged the relationship. No amount of dishes is a substitute for meaningful accountability. YTA.", "\u201cDespite all my hard work\u201d \n\nJesus Christ lady.  Keep this shit up and you\u2019ll soon be posting on the estranged parents board whining about how your hateful daughter in law has poisoned your son against you and you never see them. \n\nYTA.", "NAH\n\nTry to work on that brain-mouth filter, but it does sound like a mistake and your efforts afterwards speak for your overall good intentions.", "Did you apologize? It doesn\u2019t sound like you apologized. If you hurt someone, you apologize, or you\u2019re the asshole. It doesn\u2019t matter if you meant to. \n\nYTA.", "NAH. You weren't looking to cast blame and didn't even know she could hear you. Unfortunate that she could and took it that way, though it's understandable. All you can do is apologize and try to explain and reassure her that you don't hold her responsible in any way for what happened to her and are nothing but sympathetic towards her.", "YTA why would your first gut reaction be to ask if she fell? Very few miscarriages occur due to falls compared to occurring because something was wrong with the baby. Yeah, that was a completely rude thing to ask. Your first gut reaction should have been to show sympathy and to make sure she's phyically ok (as in not in the hospital) and if there was anything you can do... run errands, cook food etc.", "YTA. When a person tells you that he or she has just lost a baby, the only appropriate response is to express condolences and offer support. Not only could your chosen response be interpreted as blaming, it is also alarmingly flippant and dismissive. Your apology seemed disingenuous because your original reaction betrayed a lack of compassion for the situation.", "YTA. You don\u2019t need to ask questions or look for reasons when speaking with grieving people. You\u2019re supposed to listen, more than anything. Your DIL probably didn\u2019t want you at the house after her c-section, but your son likely insisted. It was nice of you to help. Not knocking that. I\u2019m just saying that you need to tread carefully and tactfully when dealing with grieving folks. With miscarriages, we don\u2019t always get a reason why! Don\u2019t look for things to blame. Listen. Be gentle. Grieve with them.", "YTA (for this purpose, anyway, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re REALLY an asshole). Miscarriages are so common in the 1st trimester, that\u2019s why most people wait to announce. Most women I know have had at least one miscarriage. No real reason. They didn\u2019t fall. Weren\u2019t in accidents. Did everything \u201cright.\u201d \n\nSo, I can see why your comment sounded ignorant at best and accusatory at worse. \u201cOmg. Is she alright? I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d *maybe* even a \u201cwhat happened?\u201d (But even that is a little invasive during such a sensitive moment). Would\u2019ve been better than, \u201cdid she fall?\u201d \n\nThat said, it was a spontaneous statement made while you were in shock. You didn\u2019t mean anything by it. And it sounds like you\u2019ve been incredibly helpful. So hopefully she can move past it.", "YTA because it seems like you didn't apologize after realizing you were on speaker which is why the issue was left festering until after her next pregnancy. You should have apologized immediately, as soon as you realized you were on speaker for assuming, not even accusing, and just asked if she was okay. You sounded like you were prying and wanting the details of what happened instead of showing concern for her. \n\nAnd you know who wants all the details of a highly traumatic event? People who judge do. \n\nI believe you 100% when you said you were concerned and not accusing her. Your words were still the problem because it sounded like wanting all the details rather than actually caring about how she was.", "Sounds like your daughter in law has issues of her own.\n\nNTA", "Yes indeed. What an awful question to ask. 1. It\u2019s highly accusatory 2. It was early in the pregnancy, 99.9999% of falls won\u2019t shake loose a pregnancy at the 10 week mark. 3. It\u2019s none of your business 4. How could you possibly believe that question would bring comfort?  \n\n\nI fear you are one of those people who - when someone shares a death in their family - are compelled to blurt out a request for details.\n\nHow\u2019s dey die!? \n\nCringe. \n\nYTA.", "Light YTA because it sounds like you had a big foot in mouth moment and are reasonably apologetic and didn\u2019t actually mean harm when asking that question but sadly may have hurt your DIL\u2019s feelings in the process. Is there any chance of having a big heart to heart sit down and having a huge heart felt apology or do you feel that\u2019s long gone at this point?", "I had a MC earlier in the year and honestly, I personally didn\u2019t know how common that they were or how they happened.  I\u2019ve since realized that most of the time it\u2019s a chromosomal issue and baby wasn\u2019t healthy.  It would still hurt if someone asked if I fell.  I don\u2019t think you said anything that someone else wouldn\u2019t say, it just kind of came out.  You said it out of pure innocence but seeing that you\u2019re the MIL, it\u2019s been taken in the wrong way.  People asked me if I drank too much caffeine, had smoked, MIL asked me if I had a Dr that specialized in pregnancy for older women\u2026anything that was said was hurtful as my hormones were out of whack and I was super depressed \ud83e\udd72", "When I had my first baby, my OB said\nsomething like there\u2019s almost nothing you can do to induce a miscarriage and nothing you can do to stop one.

What do you need?\u201d\n\nYTA", "INFO: \nDid you ever apologize directly to her for your comment since it happened and before she told you she was still upset about it??", "ESH.   \n\nYeah, asking \"did she fall?\" was not the best thing to say.  Perhaps you made the statement out of concern.  Maybe she heard it as blaming.  It wasn't the kindest thing you could have said.  But we sometimes blurt out dumb things when we hear shocking news.  I can understand you didn\u2019t mean anything by it, but I can also understand why she was hurt by what you said.  Y a bit T A there.\n\nBUT enough time has passed since this unfortunate remark that your daughter in law has had a whole pregnancy and produced a whole non-premature baby.  She has nursed this grudge long enough.   \n\nWhat you said was thoughtless.  It isn\u2019t as though you said something intentionally cruel.  It\u2019s past time to let bygones be bygones.", "YTA", "NAH. \n\nWhen your son informed you of his wife\u2019s miscarriage, traumatic news for you to hear, you responded without thinking. You meant no malice by it, and it came from a place of concern for your DIL. \n\nYour DIL experienced a very traumatic event and was grieving the loss of her baby, for which she most likely was already blaming herself. Those feelings led her to interpret your words as you blaming her for the miscarriage, which compounded her pain at that time. \n\nYes, you could have been more intentional and sensitive with what you said, but she could also have understood that their news was traumatic to you, causing you to blurt out the first response that came to mind without thinking.", "NTA", "Ngl, with all the abortion bans and whatnot this comes across very accusatory, if someone tells me they experienced a loss, the response should be sympathy, not how did it happen (not relevant at that point) \nYTA.", "I will never forget or forgive the person who said to my sister: what did you do to deserve getting cancer at such a young age? \nSimilar ignorance here.", "With the understanding that it wasn\u2019t your intention, I\u2019m still going with a YTA here. asking for a reason to something that often has no discernible reason and is quite common and utterly heartbreaking to a hopeful mother, feels like blame, even when it\u2019s not your intention.\n\nWhen I called to tell my mom about my second miscarriage, she made an offhanded comment about my job being stressful, implying that maybe that was a contributing factor. At the time, that hurt incredibly and then after it just made me very mad. It\u2019s an emotional time, and looking for a reason without being invited to do so is just added salt to the wound.", "How exactly saying \"did she fell?\" Is blaming? She was asking if it was bc of an accident, no one falls on purpose", "I am aware of this. I just had a spur of the moment reaction and spoke too soon.", "It was just the first thing that came to my mind after the shock of the news.", "I can understand be shocked but the words OP uttered to me is a how tf did you come to having those words be the first ones out of your mouth?", "Asking if she fell is like the first step to asking if she\u2019s ok. Did she fall? Did she break anything? Is she ok?", "Yeah, it was a surprising and upsetting situation and I think OP just blurted out the first thing that came into her head. Which was not great, but it could have just as easily been \"Oh no, what happened?\" or something like that. \n\nSo I completely understand why the DIL might have felt a bit attacked by the comment, especially in a time where she was already probably struggling with feelings of self-blame. \n\nShould OP have chosen her words better? Yes, certainly. But we all say things in an extreme moment that we later wish we hadn't, or realize weren't perfectly composed. \n\nI think the only thing OP can do at this point is just reiterate, \"I'm so sorry that you felt like I was blaming you for your miscarriage. That was absolutely not what I meant, but I completely understand how it might have sounded that way. I said something thoughtless in the moment, and I wish I could have chosen my words better. Please let me know what you need from me.\" And then just give her some grace, and space, and let her (hopefully) come to you.", "My mother said something similar to me 9 years ago, and our relationship has never recovered.

Given how traumatic a miscarriage is, having someone immediately assume it's your fault would probably be pretty anger inducing.  \n\n\nHowever, son screwed up too, by not telling his mom she was on speakerphone.  First rule of speakerphone is you always talk about speakerphone.  Don't have people audible to an audience they're unaware of.", "\u201cDid some chores\u201d?? OP stepped up as asked in an emergency, and deserves a modicum of grace.

The question was an instant reaction out of concern.  Calm your little prissy pants down.", "If it was out of concern why didn\u2019t she ask if she okay? Thats a reasonable question to ask out of concern. Not did she fall. If op has the knowledge to know falling is not the only reason to miscarriage then why did she ask that question?", "Thank you.", "I don\u2019t think looking for an explanation is necessarily victim blaming. A fall would have been an accident. As someone who\u2019s had multiple miscarriages, I sometimes wish I had a simple explanation like that.", "Because the why is no one's business. Just express sympathy and let them tell you what they want to tell you.", "Because she was probably already blaming herself and didn't need to hear MIL think it was due to her clumsiness.", "I assume you've never had a miscarriage?

It\u2019s an odd reaction - like it\u2019s the same as if she said \u2018what caused the miscarriage?\u2019\n\nEasy to feel blamed when someone is asking \u2018why did your miscarriage happen\u2019. It\u2019s inappropriate when they happen spontaneously and often for no reason", "It\u2019s like asking someone whose child died\n\u201cOh no, did they slip away from you for just a moment?!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so *completely random*. Falling is such a weird, random, rare reason for a miscarriage to happen. Like.. it happens. But not nearly enough to be the reason you immediately jump to.\n\nAnd just like a child slipping away for a moment or a total accident happening, it\u2019s usually preventable but also sometimes just an unfortunate accident that happens even to the most careful of people. And even if neither were immediately the parent\u2019s fault, it seems like your immediate assumption is that there must be some preventable reason this occurred.", "Whose mind goes straight to did she fall though?  Most miscarriages are due to genetic defects, through no fault of the parent.  Why things, did she fall?  That makes it seem like it was something that she caused, even through no fault of her own. \n\n It's like the old shows where people would say go throw yourself down the stairs to get rid of it. Or soaps where someone pushed someone down the stairs to cause a miscarriage.  Just don't.", "She\u2019s suggesting an avoidable cause, ergo blame. Also it\u2019s none of her business.", "It is so inappropriate to ask this though regardless.", "Because it implies it could have been avoided through precaution. Most miscarriages are predetermined at the embryo stage (genetic abnormalities that guarantee a embryo/fetus will at some mark fail to thrive), they're not triggered by external disturbances. They *can* be but that's not the norm, and if some specific accident triggered it, it's not something subtle and it will be mentioned if you need to be told about it.\n\nTo be clear, I don't think what OP said was intentionally malicious, but it was rooted in inaccuracy and somewhat inappropriate/rude, in the same vein as you wouldn't respond to someone having a heart attack with \"oh no, did he eat too much bacon this morning?\".", "*CHECK EDIT \nI wonder if you could accept, without posting to Reddit, that sometimes your intentions don\u2019t always matter\u2026 \n\nN T A , but, have some humility even without wearing a badge that says asshole. \n\nYour apology should not include any justifications or intentions because they didn\u2019t matter here.

I can see why your DIL was upset, she was devastated  at the loss of her baby and your first words were wondering if she did something to cause it.", "I speak from experience when I say that even though it\u2019s out of our control, many women feel immense guilt/blame when they miscarry because you feel like your body failed you, your baby, your husband, and the whole damn family basically.\n\nShe likely was absolutely devastated, dealing with that, and perhaps also feeling guilty even though it was absolutely not her fault. She then heard you ask if she lost the baby due to a fall, which for sure would have added to those feelings. \n\nYou may not have intended it that way, but your words increased her pain.
