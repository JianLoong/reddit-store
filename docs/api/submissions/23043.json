Unfortunately, she had a miscarriage around 10 weeks. When my son called me on the phone, I was so shocked that I just blurted out, \u201cWhy? Did she fall?\u201d\n\nShe did not fall, by the way. I didn\u2019t realize I was on speakers during that call and my daughter-in-law overheard my reaction. \n\nWhen she got pregnant again, they didn\u2019t announce until well into the second trimester. Due to my daughter-in-law ending in a very unexpected C-section, my son requested my help to come over. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry for them, washed the baby, etc. Despite all my hard work, she was still very cold towards me and treated me rather poorly. I finally asked her why and she admitted that she was furious when I sounded \u201cvery blaming\u201d when I asked if she fell that\u2019s why her previous pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. \n\nI told her that I asked if she fell not to blame her in any sense but out of concern for her. I said that I am aware there are other reasons that miscarriages occur as members of my immediate family have suffered the same. I was very sad to hear the news. All of us were so happy, excited about her first pregnancy then next day heard the sad news. We all called to speak to her directly and see how she was but were told she was not ready to speak. We tried to give the space and time she needed for the situation.\n\nI don\u2019t think she believed me though. \n\nAITA for asking if my daughter-in-law fell that\u2019s why she had a miscarriage?\n\nEdit I\n\nI now see that I was acting like the passageway of excrement. I guess I now understand why I was never invited again to their house to see my other newborn grandkids after that. They only introduced their new babies when each turned over half a year old. I don\u2019t think I will apologize regarding the fall comment since the first birth happened seven years ago and it\u2019s just weird if I suddenly bring the topic now that they have a new baby again. I might be accused of pandering like my daughter-in-law has accused me of gift-bombing previously. Thanks everyone for the wake up call.\n\nEdit II\n\nMy son did his best to be there for his wife for two weeks. One week was the baby and mom inside the hospital due to complications. My son just then started a new job and couldn\u2019t take longer days off so I volunteered to stay a bit more when he had to go back to work.", "created_utc": 1690227453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158kmvg/aita_for_asking_if_my_daughterinlaw_fell_when_i/", "score": 5516, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There doesn't have to be a \"reason\" or \"event\", it can just be a non-viable pregnancy.  Now that you know this you can refrain in future from trying to pin down a reason, lessening the danger of making an already grieving person feel blamed.", "Info - why was your first assumption that she fell?", "I mean, that's a pretty tone-deaf thing to say right when learning the news. You could have asked if she was okay or something. You know, like a person.", "First of all, I can see how you were asking this out of concern for your daughter-in-law. But as someone who has suffered multiple miscarriages, when people are trying to find a reason for your loss, it feels like they are blaming you. Very few miscarriages are due to a traumatic event like a fall. Most simply occur because the embryo is not viable or developing properly. She will likely never know the reason for her loss and that will haunt her. Regardless of your intentions, you hurt her feelings during one of the most painful and agonizing moments of her life. You unknowingly compounded on her pain, and she deserves a sincere apology for that.", "YTA\n\nYou were told she miscarried and your first words were why?  \n\nHere is a tip for you.  When someone gives you some big news, traumatic news, something obviously huge in their lives, it it perfectly acceptable and preferable to take a small deep breath and small pause - this is where you think about what to say in stead of spewing out the first thing that pops into your head.", "Yta.  This is one of those situations where you need to tuck your tail and profusely apologize.  Not because you had any bad intentions but because this situation is so painful that it just doesn't matter.  Pride doesn't have a place here.  Don't make excuses don't apologize through your son- speak to her directly, genuinely and lovingly.  \"I am sorry i said something hurtful during a terrible time in your life and there is nothing I can do to reverse that stupid remark- just please know I realize how insensitive it was and wish I could.\"", "YTA. Miscarriages happen a lot more than people realize due to a variety of things, not just from something physical.\n\nWhen you asked if she fell, you basically put the blame on her like it was her fault. You could have asked ANYTHING other than that in that moment. \"Is she okay? Is there anything I could do to help? I'm so sorry!\" would have been much better.", "Question - have you ever actually apologized for that being your first reaction? If not, do so ASAP. Either way, YTA for this being the very first question out of your mouth after hearing about her miscarriage.", "I think a \"I'm sorry, I just blurted it out, it was thoughtless.  I know nothing was your fault. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel worse\" would have gone long way to smoothing things over.", "Very soft YTA. You obviously didn't mean to hurt or blame her, but in the aftermath of a miscarriage she must have been feeling *so* raw and vulnerable, and possibly wondering to herself whether she did something to cause it. Even if it was your initial reaction to ask 'why,' you should have taken a beat and thought carefully before you said anything other than 'I'm so sorry.'", "YTA. \n\nThere is such a deep amount of shame when women lose a baby (unwarranted, yes, but it\u2019s there). To ask if she fell is so immensely insensitive as it suggests she herself was at fault. \n\nAre you unaware that miscarriages are super common? Why would you assume she fell? Not only do I think your response is assholey, I think it\u2019s just really peculiar\ud83e\udd14\n\nIt might take her some time to feel comfy around you. Pregnancy, motherhood, loss- these are things that are so tremendously connected to a person\u2019s sense of self and womanhood and you don\u2019t mess with that. Hopefully this may guide how you respond to such news in the future.", "I want to say NAH. Your response was unhelpful to say the least but it wasn't said out of spite. You also didn't know you were on loudspeaker which suggests to me that if you did know your daughter in law was on the line, you may have reacted differently.\n\nBut you do need to repair the damage with her. You need to accept that you hurt her feelings and that it is on you to make things right.", "YTA\n\u201c Despite all my hard work, she was still very cold towards me and treated me rather poorly.\u201d\n\nYea. Also, AYFKM with that take?! Because that seems to show you just expect her to get over it because\u2026you did some chores. \n\nYou said something that gutted her and seem more defenvie than remorseful about it. You may not have intended to be hurtful but wow, you stepped in it and you need to find the words to have a hard conversation and own up to it.", "YTA. You don't need to know why anyone miscarried, nor do you need to ask any questions AT ALL. Just say you're sorry and ask how you can help.", "Wait that was your first reaction? Did she fall? \n\num yes YTA its very tone deaf. \n\nAnyone would first respond with a heart breaking \"I'm sorry\" or \"is she okay? are you both okay?\" not \"did she fall?\"", "You gave her a long explanation instead of the appropriate apology when she expressed how hurt/insulted she was by what you said. You still owe her an apology.", "YTA \n\nYour intentions don\u2019t seem to be malicious but the response wasn\u2019t OK either", "YTA. You basically asked \u201cWhy, what did she do?\u201d\n\nLearn to hold your tongue. You\u2019re a grown adult.", "Lol. The majority of miscarriages are from genetic abnormalities of the embryo, not the mother falling. YTA.", "YTA. You were looking for a reason, it didn't sound like concern. Concern would have sounded like:\n\n\"On no. I'm so sorry. :( Is daughter-in-law okay? Can I do anything to help?\"\n\nNot: \"Why? Did she fall?\"\n\nIt sounded like you basically implied \"why, what did she do?\" Not okay. Don't be so nosey about \"why\", ask if she's okay. Be there. Talk about details later if necessary. \n\nIf she did fall, he would have told you.", "Op have you actually apologised to her? No matter your intentions your words caused her a lot of pain. She\u2019s not going to forgive you because of your justifications. You need to say you\u2019re sorry and actually be sorry.", "Yikes.  YTA.  I understand that shock can make us say weird things, but seriously, your very first thought was to essentially blame her for losing her child?  Doesn\u2019t matter that it wasn\u2019t your intention, that is what you said.", "NAH. You made a mistake.", "Soft YTA. It was a reaction but by god it was the wrong one.", "YTA. Falling would be the least likely cause for a miscarriage at 10 weeks. Clearly your tone made her feel as though she had done something wrong, while, it wasn\u2019t intentional, it\u2019s what she perceived. I think your best bet is to continue to try to make it up to her by explaining what an idiot you are, and that you blurted out the first thing that came to your mind. You may have to say that a lot to make her believe it.", "YTA\n\nIt definitely sounds like you thought that she caused the miscarriage. And if you haven't apologized, you are doubly TA.", "NAH\n\nA lot of pregnancies end in miscarriage during the first trimester. It\u2019s normal to be shocked and ask blurt out why when we hear shocking and painful news. I don\u2019t think we should be judged by how we react to react to hearing surprising and painful news. It is also very normal to feel a sense of ownership or fault when miscarrying. Just have a conversation about how you didn\u2019t mean to hint that it could have been her fault in any way, which it sounds like you did.", "NAH\n\nYeah, you did mess up with your reaction. It's pretty obvious that you meant zero harm, though\n\n...problem is, logic and reason go out the window when it comes to trauma and loss. The combination of physical and psychological impact on her, means that she had every right to be hurt by your kneejerk question\n\nYou're doing the right thing in supporting her. She will see that you care through your actions. That is all you can ask", "YTA. Falling is probably the least common reason for early miscarriage. If my MIL said that to me, I\u2019d assume she\u2019s trying to find a reason to blame me.  \n\nSure it was nice of you to care for them after her c-section, but that doesn\u2019t make you a hero or vindicated. she doesn\u2019t owe you forgiveness for saying something so cold and out of pocket during something so traumatic. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re in their lives still. If I were her, you\u2019d be no contact.", "YTA. It was not your place to guess why a miscarriage occurred. Your place was to express your grief and sorrow and extend assistance and comfort. People say things in the spur of the moment but what makes you the AH here is your inability to see your DIL\u2019s discomfort and apologize to her. Miscarriages happen, sometimes due to a direct event and sometimes due to just\u2026nature and biology.", "YTA\u2026.the first thing you thought when you found out she miscarried was to basically ask if it was because of something she did. You are obviously old enough to know better than that.", "Yta don't ask", "\u201cWhy? Did she fall?\u201d\n\nThat is probably one of the most mind boggling things I've heard in reaction to that situation.  I'm not trying to be insulting.  But wow.  I mean we can't always control what comes out of our mouth's.  But that was a dumb one to define dumb ones.\n\nAnd if you say something stupid, well it's not that far fetched that someone will take it the wrong way.  That you didn't \"mean it like that\".  You put your foot in your mouth and we can't just pretend that didn't happen, well meaning or not.\n\n\"When she got pregnant again, they didn\u2019t announce until well into the second trimester.\"\n\nThat's common.  We lost two and by the third we kept it very close to the chest.  It felt like we were holding our breath until he was born.  So that probably has little to do with you and your ability to say dumb things.  But I can't imagine it helped.\n\nYTA\n\nI don't know what to say.  You said something incredibly dumb and they took that and were offended.  You can throw your hands up in the air all you want as if it was helpless or you can humble yourself and just admit you said something incredibly stupid.  See it from her point of view instead of just wanting it to go away and giving excuses.", "YTA. \n\nSometimes people put their foot in their mouth. I think you\u2019re aware it was a shitty thing to say. The appropriate thing to do would be to apologize, and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. She has every right to be upset, because you seemingly never acknowledged that what you said sucked. \n\nThe fact that you got on Reddit and asked if you\u2019re an asshole, is what makes you the asshole.", "You are the AH. Your first thought shouldn\u2019t be \u201cWHY\u201d it should be \u201cis she ok?\u201d", "YTA. Seriously?", "YTA. Asking if she fell implies that she caused the miscarriage. I don\u2019t blame her for being cold towards you, she feels you blame her for the first miscarriage. You have a long road ahead of you to gain her trust back.", "YTA i would be absolutely heartbroken and furious if my father in law blamed me for a miscarriage. And that\u2019s me sitting here without the grief of the loss and the hormones running rampant. God i hope you sincerely apologised and grovelled for doing that to her at possibly the worst time of her life.", "yup YTA. your knee jerk reaction was to try to blame her for a completely common occurrence and the fact that your instinct wasn't to inquire about your daughter in law's well being or her health speaks volumes.", "YTA\n \nAccept data offered with no inquiry just support. When or if the parents are ready to offer more information you hear more. You may never hear anything.", "YTA. That was an ignorant comment. Sometimes miscarriages happen for a certain reasons and sometimes they just happen for no reason at all. Instead of explaining yourself, just apologize. Admit that you out your foot in your mouth and you realize you poured salt in a very open wound. Maybe you can get her something nice like a gift certificate to a spa to accompany your apology.", "YTA", "YTA. That question was way out of line. My interpretation is \u201cyou must of lost the baby by being negligent and therefore she was responsible for it passing\u201d your question is an outright blaming her for losing the baby.\n\nDo you not understand how cruel that was. Heck, she is much nicer than I would be. I would tell my husband, your son, that Hell would freeze over before you would be allowed anywhere near me or my babies. \n\nOn the insensitive scale of your question 1 out of 10 with 10 being totally inappropriate, you reached a 20 for me. \n\nWhat is even worse, is your clueless attitude about it. Or maybe that snarky question is really meant to hurt her mentally and emotionally. And that makes it evil, and you as well. \n\nEvidently, you have no fondness of your DIL. And that is something you need to fix. It is a you problem. Please seek therapy, and face reality that your son has grown up and you are not his priority in life anymore. That his wife is his number one now. And isn\u2019t that wonderful. Find a hobby to get over it. \n\nAfter therapy, if you can accept her with love, find a way to beg her for forgiveness for your way out of line inappropriate behavior and that you want to start a new with accepting her. And treat her how you would want your daughter that you truly love and would expect her in-laws to accept her. If you cannot, please walk away. She deserves better than you. \n\nShe holds the key to your son forever loving you as a son, and a key to her children\u2019s hearts in allowing you in her life. Because honestly, if your son wrote in, we would all tell him to support his wife and cut you out. And go No Contact with you.\n\nAnd I\u2019m in my 60s with 8 grandchildren, and three lost in miscarriages. Not once did I ever ask my DILs how did it happen. I supported them and heck cried with them and let them know that they are loved and are in God\u2019s hands. They were fortunately blessed later with a couple of children each. When my DILs talks about the ones they lost, I let them.", "Yes, YTA", "YTA, not for blurting out what you did -  it was an emotional response and I get it. You weren't trying to blame, you were concerned. Unfortunately, that's not how it was taken.\n\nBut YTA, because when she explained it to you, you should have said \"yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful with my words in the future.\"", "NAH, could have phrased it better, but intent matters, no asshole here.", "NTA There's no script in real life.", "YTA\n\n\"Why?\" Isn't a decent first reaction when  told of a pregnancy loss. It's always going to sound like you're trying to assign blame and \"why\" doesn't matter in that moment. \n\n You should actually be quite embarrassed that your first thoughts & first words weren't \"Oh, Honey,  I am so sorry!\" ,\"Is Jennifer OK?\" and \"How can I help?\" , not necessarily in that order.\n\nYour daughter in law heard implied criticism at probably the absolute lowest, most vulnerable moment of her life.  Not condolences,  not concern,  just \"how did she cause this\".\n\nYour intent isn't relevant,  the impact is.", "I'm expecting to be downvoted to oblivion but I'm gonna go with NAH only because your intentions were good. You asked out of concern for her as opposed to blaming her, which I think a lot of people are overlooking. You should still apologize and give her the time and space she needs to heal, but I also don't blame her for being hurt by that comment. Congrats on being a grandparent!", "Imagine you called your son to tell him that your husband passed away in a car crash, and in the background you hear your daughter-in-law whisper to you son \u201cOh no! Was (your name) driving? What happened?\u201d \n\nEven though you didn\u2019t mean to be cruel, it was cruel. And you should have apologized when she said that was why she was upset with you. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat you said was victim blaming. People miscarry all the time, in fact according to March of Dimes up to 30% of pregnancies end in miscarriages and of those up to 70% are from genetic or chromosomal abnormalities.", "YTA miscarriages happen for a variety of reasons unrelated to physical trauma - you\u2019re comment was entirely rude. In none of that did you actually apologize for your comment.", "YTA, maybe learn to think before you speak. That was some next level miscarriage-blaming, whether you realized it or not. Jfc, I can't believe you are so clueless you had to go to an AITA forum to figure this one out.....", "YTA. Why doesn\u2019t matter. The only question is how are you guys and do you need anything from me and dad?", "YTA. Do you not realize you never asked about her? Not - \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cIs there anything you need?\u201d \u201cAre you ok?\u201d \u201c:I\u2019m here for you.\u201d Just.. \u201cdid she fall?\u201d Like wtf lady\u2026. No empathy,. No apology. No wonder..  have made any move to atone for your callous response. No? Oh ok.. great job MA", "YTA. She is right, it sounds very blaming when she just had a miscarriage. Idk why mother in laws think they need to know the reasons for miscarriages. Like someone said 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. I had a miscarriage and went to my obgyn appt with my mother in law. ( I don\u2019t remember exactly why but I am guessing she wanted to tag along). My mother in law kept asking the NP why I had a miscarriage. For me, it made it sound like she wanted to blame me. The NP got very uncomfortable and kept explaining sometimes miscarriages happen without any reason.", "The issue here is intent vs. effect. Your question added to your daughter-in-law's grief. Whether you meant anything by it or not, the effect is still bad. You need to apologize, because mean it or not, YTA.", "ESH except the poor woman who miscarried. Why would your son put you on speakerphone to give you such sad news?  And why wasn't your first response \"I'm so sorry.  Let me bring over some meals so you don't have to worry about that\"\n\nAs for the \"fall\" comment itself, it might be helpful for you to understand that \"fall\" was a euphemism for a traumatic abortion for a very long time...   self induced, or spousal.  Please lose that term.", "NTA", "YTA if you haven\u2019t apologized (not just given an explanation) bc you obviously messed up by blurting that thought out. That was a *very* inappropriate reaction to the news.\n\nETA: You should probably be digging deeper yourself to figure out why that was your first thought\u2026 bc yes, it does sound like you were asking if it was her fault. There\u2019s a reason that was what \u201cslipped out.\u201d", "YTA - she's correct in that your immediate reaction was to blame her in some way. You know others that have suffered miscarriages - was your first thought to interrogate them as to HOW it happened? Totally tone deaf and hurtful.", "NTA.  Your intent was to express your concern for DIL's condition.  How anyone could interpret your comment as accusative is beyond me.\n\nEdit: Ladies ... please accept my apology for failing to grasp that the miscarriage changes the emotional dynamic.  A doting mother would feel guilty about any event that resulted in her baby being harmed.  I should have known that.", "NTA. she had a massive overreaction to an innocent question. asking if she fell is not blaming her.", "YTA. Do you think it was her fault she had a miscarriage? Anything can cause a miscarriage. Up to 12 weeks is when most happen, although it can happen at any time. Apologize. Asking if she fell makes it sound like you blame her for it", "Flat out yes YTA. You should have been apologizing and groveling for WEEKS. Honest mistake or not - you must be aware of how cruel it was, or you wouldn\u2019t be here.", "Soft YTA because it very \u2018pointing a finger\u2019 but if it happened exactly the way you said and it was a knee jerk reaction then I can understand why she was angry but I can understand why you just blurted it out. However I think maybe if your son had any inclination that it was a problem that you had really upset his wife then he should have addressed it long before now (can understand your DIL not doing it) so you could talk it out. I hope you can sit down and discuss it and move forward.", "NTA- it sounds like your reaction was purely off the cuff and that you were truly concerned. I think your daughter in law should be grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for them and let it go already. I never received nearly anywhere near that amount of help with any of the 3 babies I brought in the world.", "NAH, it was unintentional, you were genuinely concerned for her well being and you explained your mistake after the fact. you need to just think for a second next time and she needs to let it go", "Nta, that's honestly not an unreasonable thought. Like I interpreted that as \"is she ok? What happened?\" But it felt different to her.", "NTA. Everybody acting like they have phd\u2019s in embryology and holding you personally accountable for not knowing everything about human pregnancies can go suck a dick (and maybe not get pregnant)", "NTA but it is up to you to fix this with your DIL.

Just apologize without explanation and continue to be more cognizant of your words.", "NTA you were just concerned about what happened. obviously you know miscarriages happen for many reasons. i\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA. Not everyone responds in the most tactful way when dealing with situations they don\u2019t deal with on a daily basis. You\u2019re human, these people are jerks.", "NAH\n\nYou had no malicious intentions, but you did cause her pain. Acknowledging the pain we cause even by mistake is important. This was no doubt a truly traumatic event that was compounded by what she thought was a criticism of her. It's just an open wound that needs a little more time and care to heal.\n\nGive her a few days and then reach out again. Repeat that you are so sorry for the pain you caused. You had no intention to cause it and feel terrible about it. Emphasise that you care for her and want to help you both move past it. Don't give any further explanation as you've already said your piece, and it could sound like you're making excuses when you're not.\n\nAsk if she wants you to give her space or if you can plan a call or get together soon. I'd recommend giving clear timelines as it will stop her thinking you're ignoring / avoiding her, such as, 'can I call you in a fortnight to check in?'\n\nYour relationship is absolutely salvageable if you both put in a little effort. Let your apology sink in and keep trying. If she continues to be rude, sadly there isn't much you can do other than know you did your best to repair something you never meant to damage.", "NTA. It was pure concern and a rather simple and common explanation for what happened. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t blame her for initially reacting poorly, she did just miscarry, it\u2019s ridiculous to keep a grudge over something so small and innocent.", "I had extremely bad news given to me before over the phone and said something random that in hindsight I wouldn't have said.

Sounds like he asked you and she wasn't consulted", "YTA.", "Unfortunately, YTA. Even though it was not your intention, it did ultimately hurt her feelings hearing that from you. I know you want to defend yourself, but genuinely apologizing is probably the best course of action you can take. She may take it, may not, in the moment. In most cases, time will heal.", "INFO: did you actually apologize? Like say the words I'm sorry. \n\nThis whole posts comes like you are trying to justify your intentions. You said something bad in a moment of shock. That is understandable. But it's not unreasonable that your DIL read into it the way she said. If you refuse to apologize for your impact because your intentions were good than you are TA.", "As someone who\u2019s had several miscarriages, this isn\u2019t the best nor the worst thing I\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s a little tone deaf, but not entirely blame-y. It\u2019s human nature to want explanations for things, which is part of why miscarriages are so difficult. I never got real answers for mine. I\u2019m going to say NAH, but please make every effort to understand your DIL\u2019s feelings.", "ESH. I do think you were the AH for asking if she fell. But, it seems like you're aware of that now. I think she's an asshole for allowing you to help with her baby and not bothering to mention to you she was upset before you (finally) asked.

Apologize for hurting her in that moment.  But oh my god - stop overanalyzing and ascribing malicious intentions to every single statement.  As someone who has experienced pregnancy loss, I can't even imagine reacting personally or negatively to that statement...let alone trying to police that relationship years later.", "Yikes! Im prepared to be downvoted for this but when I first read the post, I thought it was said out of concern. I read it as \u201cwhat happened, DID SHE FALL? how can I help?\u201d Like if she fell, is she in the hospital? does son need support caring for her right now. Did she slip? Is her head okay? Idk I read it like an immediate response out of concern, I didnt take it to be OP trying to blame her. As someone who has suffered several miscarriages, I could understand someone wanting to know what happened so they know how to support me physically and emotionally. \n\nAlso, OP is close enough to ask how it happened in my opinion.

Unfortunately, she had a miscarriage around 10 weeks. When my son called me on the phone, I was so shocked that I just blurted out, \u201cWhy? Did she fall?\u201d\n\nShe did not fall, by the way. I didn\u2019t realize I was on speakers during that call and my daughter-in-law overheard my reaction. \n\nWhen she got pregnant again, they didn\u2019t announce until well into the second trimester. Due to my daughter-in-law ending in a very unexpected C-section, my son requested my help to come over. I cooked, cleaned, did laundry for them, washed the baby, etc. Despite all my hard work, she was still very cold towards me and treated me rather poorly. I finally asked her why and she admitted that she was furious when I sounded \u201cvery blaming\u201d when I asked if she fell that\u2019s why her previous pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. \n\nI told her that I asked if she fell not to blame her in any sense but out of concern for her. I said that I am aware there are other reasons that miscarriages occur as members of my immediate family have suffered the same. I was very sad to hear the news. All of us were so happy, excited about her first pregnancy then next day heard the sad news. We all called to speak to her directly and see how she was, but were told she was not ready to speak. We tried to give the space and time she needed for the situation.\n\nI don\u2019t think she believed me though. \n\nAITA for asking if my daughter-in-law fell that\u2019s why she had a miscarriage?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get that it was just one of those things you blurt out, but implying that your DIL somehow caused the miscarriage, even by accident, was just not a good move. It\u2019s just way too sensitive a topic, plus your DIL was likely still dealing with the physical aftermath and had little energy to deal with a comment like that. (I know someone who still remembers an insensitive comment her in-laws made almost 40 years ago about a loss, even though she\u2019s long since forgiven them and knows they weren\u2019t trying to hurt her.)\n\nI\u2019d apologize, sincerely, without trying to defend yourself, and just be sensitive going forward.", "I think people need to let others know they're on speaker. Not because they may say something about another person but because they may be sharing personal details about themselves.", "YTA.\n\nI can totally buy you blurted out the first thing that came to mind - but if there was no malicious intent, I think you need to think hard and examine why that was the first thing that you thought of. \n\nEither way, your intention means little when someone is hurt.

The intent doesn't really matter because it's how it landed in this situation that matters. You said what you said and now it's up to your daughter in law to decide if she's able to move past it.

Very few miscarriages occur due to falls compared to occurring because something was wrong with the baby. Yeah, that was a completely rude thing to ask.

When a person tells you that he or she has just lost a baby, the only appropriate response is to express condolences and offer support.

I\u2019m just saying that you need to tread carefully and tactfully when dealing with grieving folks. With miscarriages, we don\u2019t always get a reason why! Don\u2019t look for things to blame.

Also it\u2019s none of her business.", "It is so inappropriate to ask this though regardless.", "Because it implies it could have been avoided through precaution. Most miscarriages are predetermined at the zygote stage (genetic abnormalities that guarantee a embryo/fetus will at some mark fail to thrive), they're not triggered by external disturbances. They *can* be but that's not the norm, and if some specific accident triggered it, it's not something subtle and it will be mentioned if you need to be told about it.\n\nTo be clear, I don't think what OP said was intentionally malicious, but it was rooted in inaccuracy and somewhat inappropriate/rude, in the same vein as you wouldn't respond to someone having a heart attack with \"oh no, did he eat too much bacon this morning?\" It's just the wrong room for your brain to go, or at least socially inappropriate to be voiced.", "*CHECK EDIT \nI wonder if you could accept, without posting to Reddit, that sometimes your intentions don\u2019t always matter\u2026 \n\nN T A , but, have some humility even without wearing a badge that says asshole. \n\nYour apology should not include any justifications or intentions because they didn\u2019t matter here.

Your intention didn't match your impact and you have to recognize that when apologizing, not just denying how she felt. \n\nWhen asking questions of someone who has experienced a trauma, you're supposed to ask \"what happened?\" or \"how can I support you?\" as opposed to \"Why did that happen\", \"what's wrong with you?\", or \"what did you do?\" The first questions ask for facts or how one can help as opposed to implying someone or something is incorrect or someone or something is to blame. \n\nThese are minor language changes that can make a huge impact. If someone is traumatized, they will hear the (perhaps unintentional) blame of the language a lot louder than you meant. Unfortunately some people are aware of the differences and use them intentionally as well. \n\nIn regards to this case, the fact that your DIL assumed the worst of you makes me wonder if perhaps she has reason to. Do you ask questions that imply blame in other areas of her life? You also mention that you helped with the baby due to your \"daughter in-law ending in a very unexpected C-section\" (which could sound like you were inconvenienced by her?) and your phrasing \"despite all my hard work\" implied that you expected to be praised and thanked.

When I found out I was pregnant,  I thought it wasn't great timing because my due date would be the same week as my son's second birthday.

But also about stokes, cancer, and death. I know because we\u2019ve had conversations like that. And we\u2019ve said stupid stuff and panicked stuff and dark stuff. And if it was the wrong thing at the wrong time, maybe more grace is given because we have history to prove it wasn\u2019t malicious. \n\nLike, no one is disputing mom said something dumb. She knows it was dumb. People say dumb things in shock. I actually don\u2019t remember what I said to my sister when she told me her baby was stillborn at 8mo. I hope it was the right thing, but if all the things I expected to hear at the moment, outside the bus station in SF, it was not that, nor had anything in my life prepared me for that. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing. About 35 years earlier, my mom had a still birth at about the same time. After falling. Kind of. I don\u2019t know. No one really talked about it in the 80s. It was like something hushed I heard in passing when I was like 11. There was definitely a fall within days or hours before. I think there\u2019s debate about whether that causes the fetal death\n\nSo shit, I may have asked that. You know?  Because it\u2019s my only association with stillbirth. Or at least thought it for a second. Because we instinctively need bad things to happen for a reason or else it\u2019s chaos. So who knows what weird little thing is trapped in OP\u2019s brain that made that idea pop in her head. Feels like a fear she has while she was pregnant. Or something she heard her aunt tell her mom about at age 7 that she\u2019s never realized she was fixated on. Look, my dad, who was kind of reliving it all in the same hospital three decades later, was having his own PTSD moments while trying to support my sister and said his OWN weird shit.

I was 10 months old. My eldest sibling was 10 years old. Mom and Dads 5th child lived only 3 days, dying from a severe form of Spina bifida. My siblings and I were staying with Dads parents. Sibling heard Dad come in late at night. Asked if baby was here and was it a boy or girl. Daddy paused..\"girl\" and went into his parents bedroom. Sister heard a few low whispers and then an odd sound...she snuck over and peeked in...Daddy was knelt beside his parents bed, his head in his mothers lap, sobbing, as both his parents hugged him and did their best to soothe him. Amy, the baby, had been stillborn. His parents first concern wasn't the loss of a grandchild, it was the broken heart of their son.", "Just because the DIL took that insinuation doesn't mean the MIL intended to insinuate it.

OP didn't even realize DIL was on the line, and clearly held her in no blame.\n\nDIL probably had *a lot* of crappy feelings around that time, and OP was careless in her words, but not malicious.\n\nShe should have apologized for the careless reaction at a delicate time, but she doesn't need to be raked over the coals for it.\n\nThey both need to eat crow a little here.

If someone trips no one says \"why did you do that?\" Maybe it's a bit old generation to think something physical may have happened to cause the miscarriage but nothing from OPs post implicates she even remotely thinks it was DILs \"fault\". We HAVE to stop attaching emotions WE feel towards other people's actions or words and assuming we have all the answers. OP has to apologize at this point if only because of how DIL feels about it but DIL needs to be a little bit more open to realizing maybe the comment didn't mean what she thought so to hold a long grudge against OP (especially if it's apologized for and addressed) starts to become a bit immature (unless there is way more going on here with their relationship).

Most peeps want to say something more.\n\nAnother rule is don't tell someone something really heartbreaking on speakerphone.  She might have assumed she could ask questions bc DIL was not on the line.  At any time, for whatever reason, when you call on a speakerphone, the first thing you should say is that you're on speaker, and then who else is listening in.

Someone walked into the back crying.\n\nSomeone had walked up and killed her, her husband and their toddler. Shot out the room of the home they were in.\n\nI'd seen her two days ago. Less than twenty-four hours before she was murdered. We talked. Everything was normal. Then she was gone.\n\nAnd in that moment, I froze. I had no words. No sympathies to tell her.

It was just random violence.\n\nNot sure if my former coworker remembers that or if that whole day was a blur.  But, I remember that time I just... left. Nobody else did. I can't ask her. I still feel awful.\n\nWe don't have reasonable reactions when we hear something incomprehensibly awful. Nobody expects to get a phone call and be told their son lost his child.

These kind of abnormalities happen randomly and no one should really be to blame, but if you were looking for someone to blame here ir could only have been my husband. \n\nNo one ever asked me something as ridiculous as if I had fallen, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t have forgotten it either. YTA.", "I don\u2019t know if it just me but your whole post/ edits seem kinda I don\u2019t know\u2026 passive aggressive. Still trying to make yourself the victim. Like you don\u2019t actually want to acknowledge or agree that your in the wrong. My mother is like this and she is a narcissist. There may be a deeper reason I believe as to why you haven\u2019t seen those babies, but maybe I\u2019m totally wrong. Can\u2019t base everything off of one post. From my experience though your words here hold a lot of red flags.", "It was a weird response for sure.  I can see where it made your DIL uncomfortable and of course since you didn't realize you'd hurt her you didn't apologize.  But now you know so the ball in your court.", "When I lost a close friend to suicide, I remember so many people asking me, \u201cwere there any signs?\u201d. It pissed me off and, though I know it wasn\u2019t malicious, felt very blame-y. Reading this situation and her reaction, though very different circumstance, reminds me of that.\n\nYTA OP (a soft one), intent doesn\u2019t matter. Impact does. You weren\u2019t malicious, and definitely not intentionally assholish, but I think her feelings and response are valid .", "It doesn't matter WHY or HOW it happened. It was a loss that was shared with you, with the assumption you would be concerned for her well-being (which does not include inferring her falling was the cause). To assume was callous. You should be grateful they even let you be a part of their second child's life.", "I'm going with a gentle YTA and here's why.\n\nI lost my son at 20 weeks into the pregnancy due to an umbilical cord accident. It was gruesome and traumatic. One of my visitors asked me if I did something to cause it, such as raising my arms above my head.\n\nThat's simply not possible, and I felt like I was being asked if I was at fault for causing my sons death. I'm still not past it nearly 6 years later.\n\nI'm sure you meant no ill will in your question, but please understand her perspective. It felt as if you were asking if she were at fault.", "Not going to go so far as call you an AH, but it was wildly insensitive to imply she may have caused it (imagine the guilt she\u2019d feel).  In the end, the why is irrelevant and frankly none of your business unless they want to volunteer the info.  I hope it never happens again, but in the future, realize there are things you may not be entitled to know.  Offering love and support is all that can and should be done", "There's always so much missing information from these posts. I'm guessing there are issues surrounding this situation.", "YTA It sounds like you've gotten your medical knowledge from old soap operas.", "The thing is that a lot of women already feel somehow to blame when they have a miscarriage.  Traditionally miscarriage is not talked about and how common it really is has been understated.  Miscarriage happens in at least 20% of confirmed pregnancies.  Most of the time it's a genetic anomaly in the embryo.  The idea of mom falling and harming the baby is pretty out of date, medically speaking.  It sounds like you've justified but not apologized... whether you meant it to be or not, what you said was hurtful.  Apologize without justification... it may help.\n\nI had a miscarriage with my first pregnancy and when my husband told his parents I was pregnant the next time, his mom said, \"Well, tell her not to do whatever she did last time.\"   We have a lot of issues in his parents anyhow but I have NEVER forgotten this.  What you said isn't in a class with that, at least!", "This is a situation where you need to think before you speak", "Having a miscarriage and being asked \"why?\" \nWhat cruel shit is that?

Gotta be more careful with our words. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #ThinkBeforeSpeaking", "My MIL asked me if it was my food habits or if I didn\u2019t enough vitamins that caused my loss. What in the world could I have eaten to cause my loss?", "\"My brother has cancer.\"\n\n\"Why? Did he smoke?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "By OP's account she blurted it out in shock. To get a call and learn that your for all intents and purposes grandchild has just died and the mom was in an accident it's understandable if she was so shocked and her mind started rambling What happened? What was the accident that caused the miscarriage? what accidents cause miscariiages?! Of yeah falling that happens oh god! Did she get hurt?!  did she fall?! Except the last part slips past as she is trying to process it all.\n\nI think DIL is still sensitive about the whole thing as is the norm. Mom should give her space follow her lead and later if it's appropriate and would help assure her again that that remark was not an accusation and she has never for one sec thought she was at fault or did anything wrong. She was in shock, worried she about DIL and the question got blurted out.", "Agreed. I don't believe OP meant to imply any blame (though many, many comments seem to be assuming that) but an explanation is not the right response. Admit it was an ignorant, insensitive comment and that while you didn't mean to sound as though you blamed her, you are so very sorry that you allowed a personal reaction instead of focusing on her well-being and grief. Ask how you can repair your relationship with her and perhaps get to the point where she feels she can tell you when you've overstepped.", "Just bc you have no problem dealing with something, doesn\u2019t mean that it should be the norm for everyone.", "Most miscarriages that are from genetic defects occur earlier. OP states they already had a healthy dating ultrasound, so most people breathe a little easier after that. \n\nFalls are accidents, and OP was in no way asking if they they were DIY aborting the baby. \nThe fact you liken someone intentionally ending their pregnancy to miscarriage is more concerning than a shocked and grieving mom/grandma/MIL asking if she had an accident that led to the loss of what had, until then, been a healthy pregnancy.", "Her refusal to apologize, make me think this is not a nice person", "That does not mean that she was not hurtful, though.  Hopefully she will be able to learn to ask after the person experiencing loss rather than trying to satisfy her curiosity about the cause of the tragedy.  It is a good lesson.", "In addition to the helpful response above, I'd add two more points (that I think others have also covered in other comments): \n\n1. Pregnant women are often policed to make sure they're \"behaving\" with coffee, cheese, sushi, etc. Older generations would also believe things like \"don't lift your arms above your head, it'll twist the cord\" or \"don't eat grapes, it'll turn your milk sour\". The implication with all this is that \"doing things right\" will result in a healthy pregnancy - and if you don't have a healthy pregnancy, it's because you did something wrong. If the wife was careless and had a fall, she did something wrong.\n\n2. \"Having a fall\" is a very loaded term, historically. When it was unsafe to or impossible to access abortions, women would \"fall down the stairs\" to try to induce miscarriage. Someone angry with a pregnant woman could tell her to fuck off with \"get out of here, before I push you down the stairs\" - an implicit threat to the baby. \"A fall\" is concept loaded with misogyny, and actually responsible for only a tiny percentage of miscarriages these days. So why would OP ask only that specific question?", "It took me a good 12 months of grieving and I\u2019m still not over it and it happened 11 years ago this year. \n\nIt takes time to accept what happened but you never forget.", "How horribly insensitive. I am sorry for your loss.", "*hugs*", "Yeah, I feel like the son is TA in this case more than OP. I mean, of course ideally OP shouldn't have said or even thought that, but lots of people's first reaction to hearing that something bad happened to someone they care about is to try and understand why it happened and we don't always think about the implications of things when we're dealing with bad news, or realize that movies/TV are not accurate to reality. OP's son shouldn't have had that conversation with his wife listening in on speakerphone (or even hearing his side of it, IMO.)", "I had to tell my sister and my niece the same thing (my niece is an adult, but they live in the same house). It's not because I'm worried about being heard calling one of them names or whatever, but more that I don't know who else is in the house if I'm discussing something personal about me. Like, fuck that. My niece has different carers several times a day, and anyone could be there. No way do I want them to know about my Project Zomboid obsession!"]}
