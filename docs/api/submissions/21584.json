{"id": 21584, "submission_id": "14t7xn0", "title": "AITA for Calling Out my Big Brother About the Way he Treats the Daughter he had from a Previous Relationship", "selftext": "I, Jem (24F) recently called out my big brother Jacob (31M) for the way he treats his daughter Andy (6F) and ex-girlfriend/baby mama Elle (32F). For context, Elle and Jacob were in a 10 year relationship before having Andy but broke up when Jacob moved abroad for work but now has a new girlfriend Cheska (31F) who also has a child from a previous relationship. Elle used to work as a nursing assistant but had to stop in order to take care of Andy, making Jacob the sole provider.\n\nMy mom (62F) still keeps a close relationship with Elle and Andy and they would come to our family home on weekends to sleep over but my mom doesn\u2019t really have a relationship with Cheska. It all started when Cheska saw my mom hanging out with Elle and Andy at the mall and told Jacob how upset she was that my mom is still close with Elle. One day on video call, Andy told us her mom couldn\u2019t come with her for sleepovers at the Family home anymore because her dad (my brother) wouldn\u2019t give her money if she did. That infuriated me. \n\nI immediately messaged my brother how awful it is that a 6 year old child is already thinking about finances and would sometimes even have to ask my mom (her grandma) for McDonald\u2019s money when his new girlfriend would always flaunt the jewelry and money my brother would gift her on social media. Cheska also handles the money Jacob earns from his business here. I told him to tell Cheska to stop whining. He called his daughter a liar because he does give financial support (as if $300 a month is enough for a growing child) and me disrespectful and ungrateful because he helped pay a year of my college tuition. I told him that just because I\u2019m calling him out for his behavior doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ungrateful since him paying my tuition and how he treats his daughter are two separate issues. \n\nI also told him to tell Cheska to leave my mom out of it and that she should\u2019ve understood why my mom still keeps a close relationship with both Elle and Andy because she has a daughter herself. He continues to tell me how ungrateful the whole family and that we should never talk bad about Cheska. We are now no longer on speaking terms.\n\nWhile Jacob does help out when it comes to emergencies,my dad did spend his entire life savings just so Jacob could move abroad and my mom would even get out of her way to give out free lunches and snacks to Jacob\u2019s employees. I don\u2019t understand how we could be ungrateful.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for calling him out? Or was it the right thing to do?", "created_utc": 1688737953, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t7xn0/aita_for_calling_out_my_big_brother_about_the_way/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
