They should understand that it is HER family. It might be different if it was their mother but it isn't.\n\nThere is no reason why you should put your life on hold for three years for people who do not respect you but beware if you evict them they may do damage to the property to get revenge .\n\nIf you want to keep the peace tell them they either have to pay rent or leave .

You divorced your wife. You were never married to her sister, it\u2019s not your responsibility to house her and her wife! That\u2019s insane. Look at current rents in the area. Figure out what it would cost to have both of them rent it. Then bring the rental agreement to your ex and tell her when she gives you security, first and last months rent and signs the agreement then she can stay.

When my ex mother-in-law dies, they'll move back into their house MiL spent money to fix and update, leaving me with 3 more years of wear and tear on mine. It wouldn't have pissed me off quite as much until I found out my mother-in-law paid off their old credit card debts to the tune of $30k, then they both bought new cars. I drive a 15 year old car. Told the ex, and she just said \"Well they both work so they can make the payments.\" Yea, since they don't pay rent and don't have credit card payments anymore.

When they ask me to fix things, I tell them that's why I wanted to sell it so I wouldn't have to fix things. It's like they almost demand thinga be fixed as if they pay rent. I just tell them to fix it yourself or pay someone to fix it.

I get trying to be the nice guy and wanting to burden them during this stressful time but if the ex-wife has no legal ownership of the property then either get them to start paying some form of rent or start the eviction process( which is crazy because they have no rights to the property since they don't have a lease but I'm sure there's some type of squatters rights or something)", "Oh, and the best part is my mother-in-law spends her last bit of money fixing my ex sister-in-laws house to her liking. New floors, new appliances, new windows, new heat and air.", "How did they gain entry to begin with? They actually talked you into giving them keys?\n\nNTA. You can ask them to leave, but be prepared for them to refuse and/or be petty about. I strongly suggest you talk to a lawyer to find out what sort of legal situation you've walked yourself into. You wouldn't be an asshole for taking legal action to force them out either, whether or not you first ask nicely.\n\nAs for your children and other protesters in the family.... It is your house. You've been gracious enough to let them stay 3 years rent free!!! At this point, they can buy the house when you put it up for sale if they want to stay there. They could even try to make you some other offer you might be amenable to (pay rent or whatever), though it will be up to you whether you accept it. Hell, your kids and your sister's entire family could pool their resources and buy the house from you so ex-SIL can live there. You aren't even putting them out destitute on the street. They have their own damn house! At that point, it's a question of what your ex's family should do with your ex-MIL, which is your ex-problem (not your problem).", "So they moved into a home that they had no legal right nor permission?
