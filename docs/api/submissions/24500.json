You've been extremely generous and tolerant - way more than I would have been.", "Sell the house, if you keep it and let them live there you're not going to get any rent from them and the house will fall apart.  Evict them if you have to...  NTAH.", "NTA.  Evict them.  Contact the county and get it on record.  If they balk, if they damage anything, go after them.", "YTA for being a homophobic jerk. \u201cWife/husband/whatever they call it,\u201d seriously?  I don\u2019t believe your version of events", "It's in ok shape, I was in there the other day to fix a broken window pane. I bought it years after the divorce. My uncle moved to Phoenix permanently so I bought it from him. When he died, he left me his house there, but I live there in the winter.", "Don't want to be a landlord. I've been there and done that. It was the reason I wanted to sell it.", "I don't care how they live their lives. I'm just mad it's on my dime. You don't know me. I don't know you. What if I called you a bigot just for the s asked of it. I am the only owner. I get along with my ex and she took advantage of it.", "They probably would have fallen off the porch and sued me. Still might.", "That's the problem. Mommy is living in her daughters house. SiL was living in her own house with her mother until they got married and ticked the old lady off. Just happened that my son moved from my house about the same time. In that weekend they decided that they couldn't live together so ex said \"He won't mind if you live in his house until she dies. You can take care of mother it'll be real handy.\" To be fair, my ex helped out with my folks a lot when they were alive. But not this long.", "I did that to squatters on another rent house in the 80s.  Sent them a coupon to eat at a steakhouse on a certain date.  While they were there, had 3 buddies help me load everything up in the back of a wheat truck and parked it in my shop. When they called me and wondered if I did that, I told them they could call the sheriff to get their stuff back. Sheriff came out and told me I couldn't do that. I told him, too bad. He said it was funny and a civil matter.", "It's all mine. She thought it wouldn't matter to me because I have plenty, and they don't have any.", "I'd sell that place, cash money, tomorrow! Sheriff's deputies would be moving them out, next week. I did it to my brother. IDGAF! \n\nSquatters be damned! GTFO.", "That many people, I mean adults, living in a house should be able to pay rent. Get them out of your house.", "They are your EX everything for a reason, you owe them nothing.", "Ask exes to pay market-rate rent. Then tell your kids that the rent will go directly to the kids\u2026are the kids willing to forego their share?", "I\u2019m pretty sure that they will sell their house if your ex MIL die and they\u2019ll continue to live in your house without paying a rent. So don\u2019t waste your time anymore and evict them ASAP.", "You're an idiot. No fucking way! How do people get roped into this shit? Were you born yesterday? \n\nHad a guy try to sell us a trailer he didn't even own. We found out how much was owed on it and we bought it from the bank. Title transfer and all. Dipshit lost $10K. That's what he gets for trying to fuck us! \n\nIt's way past time to get nasty! Move in. Move their shit out! Change the locks. Shut off the utilities. I'mma nasty person when people try to steal from us. I'll make your life a living Hell and giggle about it! \n\nWouldn't take me long to run those people out!", "Then tell your ex to pay market value for the house if she wants it but end the free ride.", "Lol, I'm just saying. Rip the band aid off and do it fast because they will try everything to stay. Especially since they think they got hooks in you.", "Then she can buy it for them, or they can buy it.\n\nThe presumption on the part of your ex is next level.", "Love it. They will too!", "Don't know your situation, but that's pretty cold. I need to be that way.", "No. Her house has been refurbished and is nicer. If they do that,  I'll wait until they close on it and the other people move in. Then I'll send them papers. They'll have to find another whole another house to live in.", "I thought about moving into her house with my ex MIL. See how that goes.", "They would be really surprised to find me living in *my* house with a shotgun and changed locks. They shit would be in the front yard! Pretty sure that would be legal in every state, as the homeowner and they've never paid rent, or had a lease. Much less paid property taxes. \n\nWhat are they gonna do? Call the cops? Cops are gonna say it's a civil matter. \n\nThey gonna sue you for what? Squatting in your house for 3 years? How do they even have utilities? \n\nShut that shit down! I could take care of those people in less than 3 hours. You may not be an AH, but you damned sure better grow a spine!", "They couldn't buy a tent.", "Or give them the right of first refusal...", "That was me being nice. Yeah, be cold. Get it done!\n\nYou've been used and abused for 3 years. I would fuck with these people for shits and grins. I can be very creative. They would run after a week. I would be their worst nightmare!", "So it\u2019s HER house but she doesn\u2019t want to live there with her spouse because your ex MIL can\u2019t stand this and it\u2019s on you to give your house whom are next door to them in order for them to take care of your ex MIL.\nWhat is this nonsense ?", "Yes I could do that too but nothing beats being an ahole in a small town. At least the utilities are not in my name.", "He is a banker and understands fully how stupid it is. I don't talk about their lifestyle, just how they took advantage of the situation. You'd think everyone would be mad at the old lady who can't get along with them.", "You got it. Was supposed to be for a short time. Old lady still going strong.", "Nta Get them out quickly. You never mix business & family. When my sister (her family) moved in our house after we moved out, they caused over 12k in damages (beyond normal wear n tear). They paid 0 towards that. And treated us like the bad guys.", "NTA, but you may find yourself in a bind depending on squatter\u2019s rights where you are located after three years of the living there. I would advise speaking to a lawyer well versed in landlord tenant law and plan on going through the formal eviction process.", "Call a lawyer. Now. You may not be able to evict them easily.", "NTA - if they\u2019ve been living there rent free how do they not have enough saved up to get their own place ?  \nAsk everyone who is calling you an AH that", "You are not the AH. Do not ask permission from ANY of them. It is YOUR house, not your children, not your ex-wife,  especially NOT the freeloaders! YOURS! So send them a certified letter telling them they have 4 weeks to get out. Do this AFTER you have made arrangements with a realtor, making sure the realtor knows not to show it until after the end date you gave freeloaders. If you have to, get a lawyer! If you have to hire someone to move everything off of your property. And before I get well-meaning haters, no, I do not know anything about the laws pertaining to all this, so I assume it may need to go through steps. Hence, the lawyer.", "NTA. Why did you let your ex wife control your property? Give them notice, get it ready to sell and sell it.", "I was wondering if I was the only one that noticed that! OP knows very well two woman married are wives to each other. It\u2019s like they couldn\u2019t resist a little homophobic jab. I was on their team until I got to that. Immediately made this face \ud83d\ude2c and didn\u2019t really care for the rest.", "I only mention it because that is why they don't want to live in her own house as a married couple with her mother. She is the homophobe. Sorry if I don't know what the proper term for same sex married couples are. I guess I should just say spouse, but it wouldn't explain her mother's problem with it. \n Seems to me you are not a very tolerant person. I try to get along with everyone, which has gotten me in this situation. If it wasn't for the ex MIL not accepting nor wanting to live with a same sex married couple, there would be no problems. She could live with her wife in her own house. They want to live their lives drama free. Why does the LGBTQ+ community think everyone is out to get them? Believe what you want. YTA", "Its not your job to make your ex & her family happy. If they dont want to live together, they can pay rent elsewhere like everyone else. If your kids dont like it explain that they are welcome to pay for their new place. These ppl arent your responsibility (most of them never were)", "We both know that you already know that when a woman gets married she goes from Miss to Mrs and is called a wife. You\u2019ve used deliberately degrading language to describe them multiple times. \n  \n  I\u2019m not making fun of you for not knowing, I\u2019m pointing out you\u2019re pretending not to know so that you can get a shitty jab in, and it\u2019s obvious. Totally different and imo, makes you TA.", "So since it's your house that they live in and you want to sell.  If they aren't paying any rent or minimal rent, you can evict them but you have to follow the state laws where the house is at or they buy it at the appraised value.", "It's not like your ex-wife or ex-MIL is living there. It's an ex that is even more distant.", "What the fuck did I just read? Your ex wife let them live in your house, like she have any claim on the place? What was she thinking? \n\nNTA. They are there illegally and they should be thankful you're only want to evict them and not charge them for trespassing (which you could totally do)", "OP. A married woman is called a wife. Yes, even when she's married to another woman. What even was the point of saying \"her wife/husband whatever they call each other\"? Aside from homophobia, that is.", "It doesn't matter what anyone says just tell them to move out or buy it from you. It's **your** property. I'm sorry for saying this tho but your kids are kinda stupid if they support your ex-sister in law.", "WTAF, it\u2019s your house! You ex wife literally had no place to just tell somebody else they could live there. I\u2019d be fuming. Call her out on this and firmly tell her it\u2019s not happening, tell her to get them out or you will enforce an eviction. Why would you even think you were the AH in this situation SMH. NTA", "Too much irresponsible living. As I said before, her mother paid off her cc bills so she would have no monthly payments. Then they went and bought new cars. I heard that SIL consolidated her wife's credit card balances with hers, so MIL probably ended up paying her DIL old purchases she was too broke to pay. Neither have a cent to their names except for the house she owns, and let's her mother live in.", "Right! They should have plenty saved up by now! Lol", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t sell, they have you looking like a chump."]}
