I use the bread by myself, I want to get through the whole loaf before it goes freaking green, hard or stinking of vinegar. Therefore its cheaper to get a branded bread that I know lasts 7 days, otherwise Id have to buy 2 loaves of bread because they only last 3 if youre lucky and id end up having to throw a lot of crap away. Branded stuff is regularly on sale, and even cheaper if you look online and buy things in bulk.
