{"id": 27039, "submission_id": "16kszub", "title": "AITA for standing by my fianc\u00e9 after my family excluded him from yet another family event after they had invited him and said things would be different this time", "selftext": "So my family threw my sister a gender reveal and asked all the siblings partners to be part of the reveal excluding mine even though he had been the longest in the family and we\u2019re getting married soon and the others are just dating. \n\nWe then had a farewell to a cousin and again my fianc\u00e9 was sent around like a delivery boy once the farewell celebrations had started. More events had occurred and each time it was noted by both of us. The fact that it seemed like they didn\u2019t really want him around. \n\nNow I know you\u2019ll gonna be like but maybe they don\u2019t like him or he\u2019s rude or something. So in order to propose he done the old school thing and asked for my parents blessing and they gave it happily. After a few family events experiencing the shift I spoke to my family to let them know what\u2019s been going on as maybe it was done unconsciously. And they promised to try harder. \n\nThe next was the final straw was my sister\u2019s baby shower. We helped with the decorations and then my fianc\u00e9 was told he needed to bbq for everyone but the bbq was set up at the back of the house and the event was happening in the front of the house. When we asked if everything can wait for the food to be finished and then start the celebrations we got told yes. This man prepared everything or at least what we thought was everything, because the moment he\u2019d finish and the celebration started more food was brought to be bbq\u2019d. I got dragged to MC the baby shower and had to leave him until he was done. \n\nI felt bad and tried to get my brothers and even my sisters brothers in law to go assist in speeding up the bbqing process but they refused. He could hear the laughter and jokes being made but unfortunately was not there for anything. Once done mc\u2019ing I pulled my mom to the side and said this is what I spoke about and it\u2019s not fair that it\u2019s been happening and nothing seems to change. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 wanted to leave without causing an argument. And so we did an Irish goodbye to most people but greeted those who were on the way out and made up an excuse of me not feeling well to leave so that it doesn\u2019t take away from my sister\u2019s day.\n\nWe\u2019ve decided to limit contact and just take time to think about how to go forward. My mom has now turned the table saying it\u2019s my fianc\u00e9\u2019s fault we left early and that we aren\u2019t attending any other family gatherings and not mentioning anything they\u2019ve done prior.", "created_utc": 1694930666, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kszub/aita_for_standing_by_my_fianc\u00e9_after_my_family/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a family of gaslighters. People who cause a problem and then tell you how it's your fault or how it's your fault that it hasn't been solved. Luckily the solution is simple, as well. Tell them you're not giving them another chance to do it to you again because you're not coming over anymore. And then wait for symphony of more gaslighting telling you that you're being immature/overreacting etc. Pay it, and the immature people saying it, no mind. One of two things will happen. 1) They will eventually see the error of their ways, apologize and actually back it up with change for the better. 2) You have a few less narcissists in your life causing unnecessary drama. You win either way.", "NTA. That's pretty weird. Whether they have a reason or not, if you and your fiance don't enjoy spending time with your family then just don't. If they won't acknowledge or change their behavior than there's not much else you can do.", "You didn't mention it but could there potentially be a Racial, economic background difference, or homophobic (don't want to assume you are F-M couple)prejudice going on from your family \n\nBut definitely NTA , you highlighted your concerns politely, were ignored again and made a polite exit without causing any drama", "NTA   \nThis sounds really weird. Do you have any more examples? Why do they need to try harder for him when it sounds like it's easy for them to invite everyone else?", "I don't understand why you're tip-toeing around this.  YTA because you should have stood up for your fiance the first time he was excluded.  This is your family and they're never going to care as much about their relationship with your fiance as they do about their relationship with you.  So it's your job to deal with any problems involving your family.\n\nYou need to tell people that if your fiance is not welcome, you're not either.  He is your partner and he needs to be shown basic respect.  That means being included.  \n\nThen stand by it.  If he is excluded again, leave the gathering and take a break from the family until you see evidence that things will be different.", "You have to find out why they keep excluding him. There has to be a reason, whether it's valid or not, but there is a reason.", "NTA. There is something more going on here OP, you need to get to the bottom of it before you get married because it's either something they know about him they're not telling you or they have an issue they know they are wrong about they're keeping from you (like is your fiance from a different racial/cultural background?)", "NTA. They know what they're doing. They may start to miss you when they have to do everything for themselves.", "YTA for letting this go on for so long. You family has been treating your partner like cr*p on multiple occasions and you have done little to nothing but talk about and still go along with their demands. \n\nI am telling you, this will only stir resentment in your partner and will surely bleed into your relationship. \n\nGiven your family\u2019s history of your partner\u2019s treatment, why did he agree to do the BBQ?", "Nta I would have improved the bbq by adding lots of red hot chilli sauce to everything! Oh its too hot? don't be such a wuss! It's texan/Mexican style!", "NTA, but some of this isn\u2019t outright excluding, right? He\u2019s invited to things, but then asked to do things which removes him from engaging. It\u2019s still not fair, but it\u2019s an important distinction because since your family sounds pretty selfish, you\u2019ll need to be clear about what the problem is.\n\nIf they\u2019re going to invite him, maybe he sets a boundary that he will only be there as a guest which means declining all asks/demands to run the event. If your family gets upset, so be it - better than your partner.", "Why did it take you this long in the first place? You\u2019re supposed to have your husband\u2019s back\n\nIt\u2019s your family your circus to deal with go LC/NC until they learn manners and sincerely apologize to your husband", "ESH\n\nYou family treats your fianc\u00e9 like shit. You & your fianc\u00e9 stay there and let them continue to treat him like shit. \n\nBoth of you need to stand up & demand respect or walk.", "It sounds like this is as much about a lack of respect for you as it is for your fianc\u00e9. You are quite right to be distancing yourself from your family since they have decided to treat you like this.", "It\u2019s not unconscious, it is deliberate. NTA", "YTA - If you don't say no then you are an enabler.", "ESH", "Seems like if your fianc\u00e9 was an AH like them they would appreciate him more, rather they must think he is weak and can just be pushed aside.  Stand firm with your family and at first sign of disrespect call it out.  Tell your mom they are the ones who are causing this and have her walk you through why their behavior is acceptable.  In the future for any family events only go in as guests and offer no help and do not offer up your fianc\u00e9s help.  If he is not invited you do not go.\n\nEdit:  NTA", "NTA.", "NTA", "Send them an invoice for bbq grilling services", "Based on your other post about your sister, I feel like there is a lot missing here. Does your fianc\u00e9 not get along with your sister\u2019s couch surfing baby daddy, and they\u2019ve chosen him over your fianc\u00e9 since he\u2019s an old family friend? Your family doesn\u2019t sound supportive. I don\u2019t think going LC or NC with them is a bad idea at all.", "NTA for standing up for fiance BUT you are an asshole for letting it go on for so long. \n\nYou MC'd the whole time knowing he had been left out the back like an unwanted butler. I would've told my whole family to fuck off from the start.", "\u2b06\ufe0f Exactly this! OP should have either stand with her partner while he Bbq\u2019ed and refused to MC or stated he wasn\u2019t grilling because he should be with her. They want him to play errand boy, well, they have an errand girl as well since they\u2019re a couple. OP needs to get a spine and SHOW her family she has his back. Talk is cheap and actions speak volumes.\n\nedit: misspelling", "Not unwelcome but Seen as a servant/cook/delivery boy. \n\nNTA op but either \n\n 1. stop going to events completely\n\nor \n\n2. go and warn them you both are GUESTs so you will do NOTHING. The house can fall down and you don't lift a single finger, either if you period \n\nwhen they ask say NO , we are guests if you need a maid/cook/Chauffeur/delivery boy you should have Hired someone .", "Probably because putting on big gatherings can be hard & OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9, who was raised to be helpful when you\u2019re in someone\u2019s house, doesn\u2019t want to say \u201cNah\u201d. This is actually pretty standard behaviour, if you want to look good to the in-laws, be helpful. All this has crossed a line though.  How rude can you be???", "This. Why didn\u2019t you leave in the middle?  You\u2019ve allowed this to continue, so your family will continue to use you and your fianc\u00e9 as the help.  \n\nStop attending events!  It\u2019s clear your mom has no intention of interest in changing this dynamic so it\u2019s time for you and your fianc\u00e9 to create your own family with friends."]}
