I got into college first, got a boyfriend first, got my license first, etc.\n\nI\u2019m very close to my grandparents, and I tell them about all of my successes. I can tell that it makes them happy and that they love hearing about what I plan to do next. I even wrote my grandma a very personal poem for her birthday, to help her feel better about her dementia, and she tells me all the time that she loves it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before my cousin noticed my grandparents fawning over me at family gatherings. Apparently, it was so off putting to her that she felt the need to privately ask me about it. She said something along the lines of, \u201chow come grandma and grandpa always brag about you whenever the family is together? Do you feel like you\u2019re better than me or something, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re always bragging to them about how great you are?\u201d\n\nI asked her to slow down, questioning what she meant by that. I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than you. I just like telling grandma about how my life is going, especially because she always asks.\u201d She got snippy with me, saying that I always act like my hill is higher than everybody else\u2019s, whatever that meant. She also didn\u2019t neglect to add the fact that I was essentially \u2018cheating at life\u2019 and that my fake diploma wasn\u2019t going to get me anywhere. (I\u2019m homeschooled).\n\nI snapped back at her, saying that if she wanted to be grandma\u2019s favorite so bad, she can try harder at life like I did, instead of wasting all her time and money on Shein.

She says your Shein comment was unnecessary and insulting? What did she think of everything she said leading up to that moment??? She sounds full of jealousy. Ignore her and concentrate on yourself. It's good that you have a great relationship with your grandparents. Don't let others ruin that for you.", "I live in a sort of rural area. Every once in a while I wake up in the middle of the night and hear a catfight.\n\nJust distance yourself from this situation. \"I won't be talking about that.\"\n\nMild YTA for getting involved in this conflict. You can, and should, walk away.", "Honestly, it sounds like she is already very self-conscious about her apparent lack of successes. I guarantee you she has a voice in her head constantly comparing herself to you. It sounds like you are already aware of the unevenly distributed attention (\u201cif you want to be the favorite so bad\u2026\u201d). While I don\u2019t think you should dim your light for the sake of anyone else, I would said that the comment you made is rubbing it in her face. I think you are both asshole-ish here. She mocked your diploma and started this, you made the above comment.\n\nIn the future just remember that she is likely struggling a lot with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy. If this happens again, consider something like \u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u2019 and walk away. Nothing feels better than not engaging. It leaves the other person frustrated beyond belief, and hopefully as she matures this instances will stop happening.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's TAH on telling you you shouldn't share things with your grandparents.
