A few weeks after opening the club, the teacher asked us if she could open more classes and bring in more teachers so that other kids can benefit. We had no problems, until now.\n\n*Important, the club is not part of any school, but most consider the club as an extracurricular activity. The students are of different economic levels and ages and no one pays.*\n\nLast Saturday, our sons with their friends came to our house after their class and told us that the teachers plan to enforce a dress code starting this Monday; formal attire every class, but the main problem is with one specific rule, the hairstyle; no fancy colors or styles and must be short (specifically for boys).\n\nWe understand the dress code if they give a concert, but still, cutting their hair is a bit much and they are not willing to do it.\n\nI went to talk with the teachers about the dress code on Sunday and they told me about it. The truth is that many parents are pushing for the dress code. I was blunt and told them that if they enforce it, my sons are not going to participate anymore and if they are out, we are going to stop the sponsorship.\n\nThey freaked out and told me that many kids will suffer and the dress code was a petition from most parents. I responded that if that was the case, they have time to ask those parents for next month's rent or they can pay it (this month is already paid) and they need to find a new place.\n\nTrue to their word, they started enforcing the dress code this Monday and my kids and their friends drop out; we let them know that they need to find a new sponsor. To be honest, we only pay because our kids and their friends are part of the club and we are going to find a solution for them, but I do feel bad for the other kids that probably have nothing to do with it.\n\nMore info:\n\nMy husband I and don't intervene with the club (our fault), we let the first teacher to take care of it, that's why she never told us about the petition going around and probably thought that we weren't going to say or do anything. And as far as we know, none of the parents except for the parents of our children's friends know that we sponsor the club.\n\nWe also thought the dress code was aimed for the low-income families, but no, most of them signed the petition. So we're pretty sure it's aimed specifically at our sons and their friends, not the first time for this kind of things. My husband is almost sure who could be the ones who started the whole thing.\n\nWe have yet to find out the real reason why the teacher (and the others) accepted the petition. This nonsense go against what she and the others wanted to achieve.", "created_utc": 1675820698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wjsnr/aita_for_stopping_sponsorship_of_a_club_because/", "score": 466, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really am wanting to know what happens.", "NTA dress codes are classist and will definitely affect those from lower income families and any dress code that requires physical body modification like cutting hair or in other cases being clean shaven is an unacceptable ask.

If you have a database of names and addresses, take it with you-- the teachers aren't entitled to keep it, since you're the main sponsors.\n\nHave a written dress code in the new club: something like 'wear your clothing and hair how you want, within reason'.

Take you money and support a better program. NTA", "NTA. This was a very generous endeavor you helped to provide the kids. However if the managing teacher (I presume a band director) was willing to cowtow to conservative parents and this was explicitly unacceptable to you yet the teacher followed through with it, then the teacher must deal with the consequences. They messed up. \n\nPresumably they established the policies of the club you sponsored and reserved the right to make changes. You have every right to withdraw your support or even disband the club entirely if it's being led in a way you do not support. You were pragmatic in allowing the club to continue on without you. The teacher can ask the other parents to sponsor the program or do the fundraising work themselves.\n\nIf you and your kids are still interested in such activities, I'd be willing to bet other schools' band directors, or former/retired band director would be very excited to direct another club with your financial support! If you do that, I recommend y'all sit down and draft formal club policies that students and parents sign so this doesn't come up again. Be sure to include an explicit dress code section saying what is prohibited, even if it's extremely lax or has next to nothing listed in that section. The fact that a dress code policy is included and does not dictate male hair length or bans certain types of articles of clothing will prevent this silliness from coming up again, because the parents will need to sign off that it's acceptable to them. Also include a statement indicating that your club practices inclusion and lack of judgement (be sure to call out judgements based on appearances).\n\nA slightly different option is to wait it out, let the club fail without you, then approach the band director after the fact and talk out the situation. The goal here would be to restart the program without room for this kind of thing to happen again. Make the same agreement as in the previous paragraph; sit down together and draft a club policy document to be signed by all people/parents who choose to participate. If they will not sign, they cannot participate. If they participate and complain about boys' hair length, they can be told they signed the policy and their only option is to drop the club, as it is a privately organized club. \n\nNTA.

Typical nonsense from people who never contribute a penny yet they expect to be catered to. Start a new club.", "NTA.\n\nNever understood the dress code rule of short hair. Why? My nephew has awesome long hair. It is also part of his culture. Wouldn't making him cut it, or ban him from practice, be a form of discrimination?\n\nAnd just... Why? It is hair. Oh no the horror!", "I'm going with NTA. It would almost be n-a-h because in the long run they took it over, but to be shocked that you wouldn't continue to pay if they started a rule that would cause your kids to stop participating moves them to AH territory.

If their appearance is good enough for school, it\u2019s good enough for a music club that you bloody keep afloat.", "NTA looking forward to an update.", "NTA. I'm mixed race and tend to wear wigs or have my hair in braids and one occasion I did have locs. My grandmother came to the school because a teacher was complaining about how much I allowed an autistic boy to touch my hair. My parents have gotten calls (post abuse for those who have seen my removed posts. It only went on to the end of middle school when I returned from foster it got better) for how my boobs showed through some of my shirts. My mom pointed out how a popular kid was wearing the exact same thing. Personally I think the hair rule was a dick move by the school. Some people HAVE to have there hair a certain way during to texture, culture, religion or even mental health reasons", "NTA but I'm heavily invested in seeing how this plays out. Please give us an update in a month or so. I'll buy popcorn for everyone", "NTA", "NTA. You get what you pay for and if they don\u2019t want to pay for it then they don\u2019t get it. You have every right to withdraw funds from something that doesn\u2019t fit your values. OP I am begging for an update on how this turns out.", "NTA have your kids and friends have a club...in your garage or basement. Thay can start a band:)", "NTA That's a really weird rule to even be created for a non-school sponsored club. Hell, even in my school symphony band we didn't have any rules besides formal wear at performances. I had bright colored hair and friends with mohawks, liberty spikes, etc.", "NTA.\n\nIt was pretty standard for the musos at my sons' school to have long hair, and be a little unconventional. This is in Australia. Where are you that's so image-conscious?", "Whatever the reasoning behind this petition you\u2019re NTA.\nYour kids started the group and nobody should be imposing new rules on them.\nThe motivation is not your concern, protecting your kids and their friends and insuring they still get their lessons is the only thing you need to worry about.\nLet the petition people figure out their own stuff.\nGood for you for standing up for the kids", "NTA: They want the students to look like dolls instead of who they are, they can pay.", "NTA, this is a total no-brainer.", "NTA- I see in your comments it's alternative kids you think they've aimed this at. I fully endorse your position that an extracurricular in a creative area is about letting kids express themselves, not stopping them. And here's my idea: Find some alternative musicians who want to set up an afterschool, and sponsor them for an inclusive club that enables creativity and expression. SO MANY alternative, metal and punk musicians are classically trained. This \"teacher\" could be crushing the spirit of the next Mariachi El Bronx!", "Exactly this. My 9yo does musical theatre. She wanted to sing, dance, perform in some way for a long time but I didn\u2019t want her doing ballet or anything that involved her having to look a certain way - ie perfect hair, make-up*, clothes and weight. The performing arts school I found for her is amazing, the kids turn up to class wearing all sorts of mismatched outfits, scruffy hair etc, but they have fun and are learning a lot about acting, comic timing, projecting their voices etc.\n\nThe only time appearance matters is at the concerts, and even then it\u2019s not over the top.\n\n*Stage make-up accepted, but the dance schools are next level batshit.", "Especially if they impose rules targeted at ops children and friend circle", "PLEASE publicly say that you do not agree with this classiest move and that as THE sponsor you will remove funding as it does not align with your values and tell us how the scramble because I know the parent that wanted it actually just wanted to get rid of your little alt boys and thinks you probably have fuck all money", "Pretty sure you don't want to work with whatever teacher was happy to impose the dress code.", "And yet, when it was brought to your attention and you let them know you didn't agree with it and would not be supporting the club financially going forward, they went and did it anyway.\n\nNTA.", "You said in another comment that you think this dress code was specifically targeting your sons\u2026 and yet they thought you weren\u2019t going to do anything when they target your sons?\n\nSo they thought that you cared enough about your sons to create and sponsor this club but then don\u2019t care enough about your sons to support them when they are being targeted?\n\nThat makes no sense.", "Do you know this independently from the teacher that told you? Its certainly plausible that it is true, but I wouldn't want the teacher to be pulling one over on you", "When they say agreed was it so you want a dress code yes or no.... or was it do you agree to this outlined dress code that will be required? Depending on the wording, I bet several thought they were agreeing to rules already in place since they were just joining the music club.", "I grew up around a lot of indigenous people so that was my first thought too.  And yeah there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ask anyone let alone an indigenous person to cut their hair.  I don\u2019t get why people are so weird about hair, if it\u2019s not on your own head why care??", "No fancy colours or styles. I lean more to homophobia/transphobia being the issue", "My family was so poor and I was a different size than my mom. I had actual panic attacks trying to find clothes for choir, including a hysterical breakdown from the time I tried to wear one of my moms dresses for a concert, we got it zipped, then i inhaled and split the zipper. I was a 32e back then and tiny other than my chest, but my mom was anorexic so I already had major body image issues. \n\nShe absolutely would support dress codes like that, even though I was a wreck. \n\nSilver lining: I didn't even have a phone to call anyone (our service was shut off for not paying) to ask to borrow something and the concert was a leave from school thing so I was sure I was going to miss state qualifiers, but a friend brought an \"extra\" dress because \"she couldn't decide what to wear\". Pretty sure she knew I didn't have a dress but didn't want to embarrass me. What a rockstar.", "They probably thought they'd be provided perhaps?", "The real question is who started the petition. NTA", "No, I haven't spoken with those parents but the petition for the dress code came from them and not the teacher, she showed me the form. I don't think she is lying.", "That's what I was thinking.  I don't see most parents signing up for more regulations regarding their kids.", "I think this is important. Most parent don\u2019t have enough time to deal with these! maybe the wording sounded like are you okay with dress code, and they basically said okay cool as long as kids have club we don\u2019t care!", "It was unnecessary ever, people are just finally starting to realize that.", "NTA. I think this is fantastic. I\u2019m female and wore black lipstick and half my head shaved through most of high school back in the 90s. My mom wielded the clippers. Nobody cared at my school. Good for you not making your kid stick to stupid, regressive, controlling tactics by other adults.", "This is very unusual, but you did the right thing. Clubs have to know that if they enforce bigoted rules like this, they are going to piss people off, including sponsors and benefactors.\n\nWhat do your sons play? Can they join the youth orchestra in their area instead?", "And the club started for THEM!", "This.", "My thinking is that, if they aren't just doing it to get rid of certain kids, they want to make the club look more prestigious. As /u/circe1818 points out, low income American schools are more likely to have strict dress codes and uniforms. It's a whole thing.", "I don't know what they were told. But I don't think so because they sent their kids well dressed on Monday.", "My husband is almost sure who they are. We just have to confirm it.", "Only Anglo Saxon Jesus. Actual Jewish Jesus most like;y had short curly black hair as was the custom. \n\nNTA. enforcing a dress code and hair length restrictions on an after school club is just ridiculous. A music club is supposed to be fun and a place to express creativity. Unnecessary rules stifle creativity.", "Which the bible says is an abomination on men.", "Actually, he didn\u2019t.", "Oh man, I can't imagine trying to impose a 'formal' dress code on the music kids at our school! I mean, they're all very good about wearing required concert dress (white top - no t-shirts; black bottoms -no jeans; black shoes -no sneakers; black tops and bottoms for choir) for, you know, actual PERFORMANCES, and they are good about having TIDY hair for performances... But that doesn't mean we don't have seven colours not found in human genetics, lengths from buzzed to butt and back again, braids, dreads, spikes, curls and afros. And that's not including the beads, feathers, clasps and other ornaments that show up regularly. \n\nAnd you know what? The only time it's ever been a problem is when someone's hair actively interferes with making music - so, yeah, when your beads are banging into your violin every time you play, that hair needs to be pulled back; and if your spikes are so long they're interfering in your choirmates being able to see the teacher, that's an issue to be discussed. \n\nOther than that... As long as it doesn't have offensive language/images on it, and we're not seeing any nipples or genitals, have at it!", "Only a handful of people know that we sponsor the club. I don't know what are they'll do when they find out.", "I'm betting that the parents who want this rule don't realize that OP pays for the club.", "It's probably pretty easy to bully people into thinking they need to adhere to a dress code.", "They fucked around and are about to find out.", "Do you think it might be a conservative religious thing? Like they feel like your son and his friends style of dress is \u201cnon-traditional\u201d so they\u2019re trying to force their version of morality on them?", "But the teachers knew - the fact that they implemented rules aimed at OP's kids and then expected OP to continue to bankroll this club is pretty ridiculous. \n\nThe parents, if they didn't know, are in for a rude shock, and honestly, great. Forcing boys to cut their hair short because they don't like them being a bit alternative is shitty and they should experience some impact from their behaviour.", "Yeah, I don't know what the teachers were thinking. Maybe they underestimated how much OP cared about letting their kids have their hair how they want."]}
