The students are of different economic levels and ages and no one pays.* \n\nLast Saturday, our sons with their friends came to our house after their class and told us that the teachers plan to enforce a dress code starting this Monday; formal attire every class, but the main problem is with one specific rule, the hairstyle; no fancy colors or styles and must be short (specifically for boys). \n\nWe understand the dress code if they give a concert, but still, cutting their hair is a bit much and they are not willing to do it.\n\nI went to talk with the teachers about the dress code on Sunday and they told me about it. The truth is that many parents are pushing for the dress code. I was blunt and told them that if they enforce it, my sons are not going to participate anymore and if they are out, we are going to stop the sponsorship.\n\nThey freaked out and told me that many kids will suffer and the dress code was a petition from most parents. I responded that if that was the case, they have time to ask those parents for next month's rent or they can pay it (this month is already paid) and they need to find a new place.\n\nTrue to their word, they started enforcing the dress code this Monday and my kids and their friends drop out; we let them know that they need to find a new sponsor. To be honest, we only pay because our kids and their friends are part of the club and we are going to find a solution for them, but I do feel bad for the other kids that probably have nothing to do with it.", "created_utc": 1675820698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wjsnr/aita_for_stopping_sponsorship_of_a_club_because/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not and they failed to listen to you so now they can find other sponsors or disband.", "NTA. You said it,  if \"most\" of the parents want a dress code  (which wtf? Aside from being decently dressed,  why does a club like this need a dress code?) Then \"most\" of the parents can pay the rent/fees.", "NTA. This new rule clearly conflicts with your philosophies, and philosophy is central to sponsorship. They can find another sponsor whose philosophies align with their own. Meanwhile, invest yourselves in a new/different project so you can continue to benefit youths who need it. Thank you so much for your kindness and generosity.", "NTA. FAFO. Take your money elsewhere.", "NTA.  Start a new club.......  I don't know what this obsession with dress codes is....who cares if your hair is purple?  Does that stop you from learning?    And what is 'formal attire'?  Do they have to wear suits and evening gowns?  \n\nI'm curious - did they actually show you any 'petitions' from other parents?  Have other parents ever said anything to you?  Because that sounds like they are blaming someone else for their decisions - the old 'I was just taking orders' defence......", "NTA - they pushed your sons out of the club, and subsequently, your money too.", "I guess why does a teacher get to impose anything for this, it\u2019s not at school, it\u2019s not school sponsored and you are paying for it. NTA", "NTA- an enormous part of the arts is self expression, so to stifle creativity within a music group seems off. If you set out to build a community for all, then all should be welcomed as they are. What terrible parents to try and dictate what they think other children must conform to. Not to mention this puts a severe disadvantage to poverty stricken students that could benefit from there community you\u2019re striving to create.", "Easy NTA, they shouldn't have even attempted to put that rule into effect without talking to you first. they fucked around and found out.", "NTA but I WILL NEED an update in about a months time.  I really am wanting to know what happens.", "NTA dress codes are classist and will definitely affect those from lower income families and any dress code that requires physical body modification like cutting hair or in other cases being clean shaven is an unacceptable ask. However I feel like you could have just fired that teacher since you pay for everything .", "NTA. You are doing this for your kids, that doesn't obligate you to continue to fund this once your kids are done regardless of the reason.

Regardless of their reason for not participating.", "NTA: They want something you disagree with you have full right to pull your money. But also, who really wants to dictate children's haircuts and styles. That seems ridiculous. This is a time in a child's life where they should be able to experiment and such. \nToo many places I have worked won't allow for non natural hair colors. So if you never got to have fun as a kid, you don't get to either as an adult, I find that sad.", "NTA.  A dress code and hairstyle enforcement seems like it could become exclusionary real quick.", "I went to a grade school with a dress code and hated it.

Enforcing a dress code, especially mandatory hair cuts, for a music club that has nothing to do with any school is ridiculous. Who cares if the other parents are pushing for it? It\u2019s still ridiculous. So I think you\u2019re right in that if the those parents want to push this ridiculous dress code, they can pay for it. You were doing something good and drew your line in the sand for continuing to sponsor it. They crossed that line so your sponsorship is gone.

If you have a database of names and addresses, take it with you-- the teachers aren't entitled to keep it, since you're the main sponsors.\n\nHave a written dress code in the new club: something like 'wear your clothing and hair how you want, within reason'. That way all the kids know they won't have to dress up or do anything with their hair, and the poorer kids won't be worrying about losing out because of the snobs.", "Oh heck no!  Why do these other parents and the teachers think they can put stipulations on how you spend your own money?\n\n\"Thank you for your time.  Best of luck to you in your new club!\"  **poof bye**\n\nNTA", "NTA dress codes are classiest and that\u2019s literally the consequences of their own shitty actions on enforcing something that stupid", "NTA\n\nWhile I see both sides of this coin if you disagree with the narrowness of the dress code withdrawing support is absolutely acceptable.  Thirty days notice is a little quick but not necessarily wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt was not the club you started.", "NTA, you both sound like incredible parents!", "Don\u2019t you know that long hair on boys disrupts their hearing and hence their musical ability?! s/\n\nI don\u2019t know what variety of bigoted, homophobic, racist, and/or classist insanity this is and don\u2019t care. Take you money and support a better program. NTA", "NTA. This was a very generous endeavor you helped to provide the kids. However if the managing teacher (I presume a band director) was willing to cowtow to conservative parents and this was explicitly unacceptable to you yet the teacher followed through with it, then the teacher must deal with the consequences. They messed up. \n\nPresumably they established the policies of the club you sponsored and reserved the right to make changes. You have every right to withdraw your support or even disband the club entirely if it's being led in a way you do not support. You were pragmatic in allowing the club to continue on without you. The teacher can ask the other parents to sponsor the program or do the fundraising work themselves.\n\nIf you and your kids are still interested in such activities, I'd be willing to bet other schools' band directors, or former/retired band director would be very excited to direct another club with your financial support! If you do that, I recommend y'all sit down and draft formal club policies that students and parents sign so this doesn't come up again. Be sure to include an explicit dress code section saying what is prohibited, even if it's extremely lax or has next to nothing listed in that section. The fact that a dress code policy is included and does not dictate male hair length or bans certain types of articles of clothing will prevent this silliness from coming up again, because the parents will need to sign off that it's acceptable to them. Also include a statement indicating that your club practices inclusion and lack of judgement (be sure to call out judgements based on appearances).\n\nA slightly different option is to wait it out, let the club fail without you, then approach the band director after the fact and talk out the situation. The goal here would be to restart the program without room for this kind of thing to happen again. Make the same agreement as in the previous paragraph; sit down together and draft a club policy document to be signed by all people/parents who choose to participate. If they will not sign, they cannot participate. If they participate and complain about boys' hair length, they can be told they signed the policy and their only option is to drop the club, as it is a privately organized club. \n\nNTA. Good luck, and once again, very cool of you to support the arts and the kids!", "NTA.  Dress codes are such bull$hit", "NTA. Typical nonsense from people who never contribute a penny yet they expect to be catered to. Start a new club.", "NTA.\n\nNever understood the dress code rule of short hair. Why? My nephew has awesome long hair. It is also part of his culture. Wouldn't making him cut it, or ban him from practice, be a form of discrimination?\n\nAnd just... Why? It is hair. Oh no the horror!", "I'm going with NTA. It would almost be n-a-h because in the long run they took it over, but to be shocked that you wouldn't continue to pay if they started a rule that would cause your kids to stop participating moves them to AH territory. They should have anticipated that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Looks like the teachers and other parents have now reached the FAFO portion of their musical training.  They can take the money they'd spend on attiring their children in \"dress code\" clothes and use it to pay the rent. I'm sure you can find a new place to practice and acquire a music teacher not so subject to undue influence.", "NAH. They are entitled to enforce a dress code if they want.

Please update and let us know if they fall flat in the next month or two, or if they beg you to come back.", "It sounds like they don't really want your sons and their friends in the class but they still want the money. It's frankly a little ridiculous that these parents have this much say in a dress-code, and that the club ever thought they could exclude your sons (or make them cut their hair) and you would still pay. It's unfortunate for the kids who have nothing to do with it, but a learning experience for the parents who want to have their cake and eat it too.", "I'd bet because it's at least partially targeted at getting rid of OP's kids and their best friends, and the other parents didn't realize that OP was the one holding the purse strings because \"there's no way they have much money if they let their boys dress like *that*\". And now they're going to find out the hard way because the teacher was too much of a coward to tell them some hard truths."]}
