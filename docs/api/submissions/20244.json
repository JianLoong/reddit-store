Most likely step-mother is only a legal term. That is her dad's partner. She had nothing to do with raising OP, therefore is not a maternal figure in her life. This means, she most likely will not have a maternal relationship with OPs daughter, as they've only been married a year. \n\n>She is your dad's wife and she has been since your daughter was born, and yet she is called by her name\n\nOP stated in the post that they have only been married for a year, together for three years. This means Kelly wasn't even in the picture during most, if not all, of her pregnancy. Marriage doesn't equal formal titles if all parties don't agree on it. \n\n>while someone who he only dated for a year and was never married to him gets the title of grandmother.\n\nHe may have only been married to her for a year, but OP states that they've been close for the past six years and are currently best friends. She was there throughout OP's entire pregnancy and her daughters entire life for support. Meaningful relationships create formal titles, not familial ties or blood. \n\nMy dad has been dating a woman for three years almost and has no title with my kids. They call her by her name. I call her by her name. They've been committed and living together since before my youngest was born, yet she is still just \"name\". \n\nMy kids have lots of people that they refer to as aunty/uncle that are not related to my husband or I, but that we have close relationships with. \n\nKelly is not entitled to anything, as from the post she has no \"role\", other than that of OP's dad's wife.", "Because we just clicked.
