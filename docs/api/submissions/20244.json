This is the equivalent of BDE, she wants all the attention and praise and connections to sink her claws into him.\n\nScrew that. Your private life IS YOUR PRIVATE LIFE.

It\u2019s not like they did this to hurt her. It was a nickname and a joke that was already in place. To get upset about it, and take offense is absurd because when you come along into any situation, the world is not suddenly going to adjust to your existence. You adjust to the surroundings, and the ways that people have already established in the environment. To expect others to do it for you when you\u2019re just one person is very self-centered unfortunately. Please do not apologize to her.

In my family and area, spouses who aren't the \"natural\" family have to earn their title. My sister calls someone a uncle that I wouldn't introduce that way, even tho he is by marraige. My children call people their aunt who has no relationship to them, even tho they have 2 aunts and 1 great  aunt... kinda seems like the other person made themselves part of YOUR family, has Kelly made the same efforts the other person has? Are you not allowing Kelly to be part of your family?", "NAH - You can have your daughter call someone whatever you and that person are comfortable with your daughter calling them. However, I do think that your actual step-mother has a point in being upset. She is your dad's wife and she has been since your daughter was born, and yet she is called by her name while someone who he only dated for a year and was never married to him gets the title of grandmother. I could see how her feelings would be hurt by that. Would you feel comfortable sitting down with Kelly and coming up with a name that might make her feel more involved/respected in her role? I think that's the best solution.", "NAH\n\nI think Kelly has cause to be upset since they did marry your father and are her step-grandmother. \n\nI think it was a running joke that might just need to stop to protect Kellys feelings.", "ESH Everybody Sucks Here but your father.\n\nKelly is making more of this than is necessary at this point.\n\nBut your daughter never had a relationship with Celine at all, so it is very odd that you've encouraged your kid to call her \"la meme\" in the first place. Kelly has been your father's partner for the whole of your child's life, unless I have something wrong in this timeline.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
