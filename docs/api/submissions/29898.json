And unfortunately for the employers who take advantage of this law, that works two ways. No law requires you to give any notice. You can quit in the middle of the day and walk out then and there if you want to.\n\nAnd I actually think it was very big of you to give any sort of notice at all, given the circumstances.\n\nNTA, and be well.

As is when they become verbally abusive, but the health reason will sound better to future employers.", "NTA two weeks is standard procedure. Hell they are lucky they got that much. \n\nWe have hired people that come in seem ok with the work and work for a few weeks and then they go to lunch and boom never came back. We\u2019ve also had some that go through the drug and background tests and on the first day they watch the safety videos and come out of that saying they can\u2019t work here.

They dont deserve any advance notice, and loose any sympathy because of their behavior.\n\nGood luck and get well!", "There is no law on the books requiring workers to give a 2 week notice.

Two weeks for a notice of quitting is normal and even considered the standard for most minimum wage jobs.  That's plenty of time for them to adjust their schedule, and I don't even see why it would be *your* responsibility to find a replacement.\n\nHonestly, don't go back if you don't have to.

As stated by this poster you employer is not required, and would not give you notice if they fired you, or even randomly decide to cut your hours. In fact I willing to bet that over the course of your employment your hours have been cut without notice. \n\nBased on how they treated you, when you had the courtesy to give 2 weeks (which is not as many have pointed out legally required), and knowing you are unwell, they are going to make your time left miserable and wouldn\u2019t give you a glowing reference if that is why you are tempted to stay the 2 weeks. \n\nEmployee\u2019s in hourly in service jobs like cashier, fast food worker, and similar usually low paying jobs that deal with increasing abuse due to issues out of their control, rarely give notice (I have family in hr for target and a large call center), your employer instead of appreciating that you did yelled at you.

As most employment in the states is at-will an employer also isn't required to give you a two week notice prior to terminating you.\n\nOP is not in the USA.

Other countries have different Industrial Relations laws and may in fact require employees legally to give notice on quitting employment. Giving posters a blanket reassurance that they don't have to give their employer notice is making some huge assumptions and is not factually correct."]}
