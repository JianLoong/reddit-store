Does your sister not like her husband?\n\nNTA", "NTA. You've tried to tell her politely that you're not interested in fostering/adopting. She continues to push the issue and run it into the ground.", "Absolutely NTA. You enforced boundaries, your sister refused to respect them and you responded definitively.", "NTA - Simply put, you wouldn't be a good foster parent because you don't want to be one. Foster kids go through a lot, and if you truly don't want to be there for them, you would just be part of their problem.\n\nUltimately, though, your family needs to realize regardless of how a kid comes into a family, they are special, not a mistake. How cruel is your sister that she sees a baby as a mistake?", "NTA.\n\nUltimately, your reasons don't even matter.  You are not obligated to take responsibility for other people's children, and your sister has no right to keep trying to pressure you into it.", "NTA Your sister and family are being ridiculous. How you have a child is between you and your wife. No one else gets to have a say.", "Your life your decisions ffs. Big NTA. In fact your sister is a huge AH for trying to push you into doing something you do not wan to do.", "NTA\nFirst, it's literally none of her business how you decide to expand your family. Second, what's wrong with idolizing your wife? Isn't that how a loving union supposed to work?", "Nta. When and how a family or person decides to have children is a very personal decision.", "NTA at all. She kept pushing an issue that\u2019s none of her business. Your irritation is justified. Taking in foster kids is a completely different ballgame than having bio kids. It\u2019s perfectly normal and reasonable to decide to do IVF.", "NTA. Everyone's path to building a family is different, and (assuming no one is stealing babies) there is no right or wrong way to do it. Your sis can care for those kids without trying to slough them off on others.", "NTA. Having a biological child, from birth on, is an entirely different thing than having a foster child. I was a foster child once. They come with a lot of context, to put it mildly. And the relationship is also very different.", "The way you chose to build your family is not her business. She cannot dictate the way you have children.\n\nNta", "NTA - she\u2019s not the one living your life, doesn\u2019t get to make calls or force opinions of something so personal on you.\n\nOn top of that, why would you recommend someone whose heart clearly isn\u2019t in it, to be a foster parent/adopt a child from these circumstances? I\u2019m sure she has good reason think you\u2019d be a kind and empathetic parent for a child in need, but if it\u2019s not something you want, Jesus Christ these kids have been through enough to be placed with someone who doesn\u2019t *want* to be their parent.", "NTA\n\nThis would make me want to go low or no contact. This is absolutely none of her business. How a couple wants to have a child is a very personal decision and she needs to butt out of this. It\u2019s great that she adopted, but it\u2019s really out of line to demand other people to when they want to expand their family.\n\nBut I\u2019ve heard this on reddit too many times before, and sadly she probably won\u2019t stop, lots of couples who have fertility issues can be downright obnoxious and expect friends and family to do EXACTLY what they do and armchair diagnose reasons as to why the person they are trying to convince won\u2019t do it(idolizing your wife is the problem in this case, which is certainly false) classic signs that she unfortunately is still probably very troubled that she can\u2019t have biological children and seeing you and your wife having your own infuriates her.\n\nEDIT: spelling and general clarity.", "NTA  If you don't want to foster kids, you won't be approved as a foster family. Why don't you just tell your sister that the next time she brings it up? Just say, \"I'm sorry,  we won't be approved.\" Leave it at that.", "NTA. How you build your family is none of your sister's business. She's rude to keep pushing the issue.", "NTA.  Go no contact with these people. You don't need them in your life.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nEveryone who goes through infertility hears this sort of nonsense if they're open about their struggles. \"Oh, you should just adopt, there are so many kids in need!\"\n\nWell, yes. There are. And the person telling you that can adopt them. You know that and you've likely weighed the options and decided it's not for you. Everyone's journey is different. Nobody should be a foster parent or adopt unless they want to. Foster kids especially already have so much trauma. Your sister's choices are her choices. Yours are yours. And neither is better than the other. \n\nWe chose IVF to have our daughter too, and then tried frozen cycles with our leftover embryos (unsuccessfully) to have a sibling. We personally chose not to pursue further treatment once we used all the embryos. We've considered fostering now that we've gotten past all the treatment and come to terms with the way the family looks now but haven't moved on it. Maybe you will too, maybe you won't.", "INFO\n\nDid you say \"I dont want foster kids, I want kids who look like my wife\" in front of or within earshot of her foster kids?", "NTA. This is your personal matter and she has no right to intervene.", "Definitely NtA. Being a foster or adoptive parent isn\u2019t for everyone! It\u2019s Greta that your sister and her husband can be, and I commend them for it, but it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else in their lives should also be! They\u2019re pushing their beliefs on you way too much. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting a child that looks like your wife and there\u2019s was no shade thrown at your nephews. Sound alike your sister is still mentally and emotionally dealt with the fact that she can\u2019t have her own children and her being pushy about her beliefs is her way of compensating for it. She right and everyone else is wrong type of mentality. I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology either. I think she owes you one for being so pushy and abrasive. Good luck with your IVF journey!", "NTA, it\u2019s completely your choice how you want to add to your family", "It's a little close for me but I'm going to say NTA. You left the conflict when you were very angry. Well that's what you're supposed to do. You should not gone for the jugular in the end. And it goes without saying that your sister has been doing the same thing regularly. When someone repeatedly does something that is hurtful or disrespectful, it is unsurprising that they receive the same in return. I hope you have both learned something from this.", "I am confuse because you kid isn\u2019t biologically yours either? She\u2019s your wife\u2019s kid and a donor\u2019s, you are the surrogate. You already adopted so both of you are wrong. ESH", "ESH, but mostly your sister. You could have gone about it better than saying you want kids that look like you and your wife, but her obsession with bringing it up is weird, especially calling it a mistake. Good on her for adopting, but that's her life and she needs to respect that you can make your own decisions for your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your sister (and the treat of the family) can fo.  I will say that we are training to foster at this very moment.  We took in a young lady in need before as well.  These kids need good people.  But there is a shortage of good foster families. If you ever have it in your heart, consider it.  BUT, a foster parent guilted or pressured into it is NOT a good foster parent.

Adoption and even just fostering have deep rooted trauma and mental health potential. They are fantastic avenues, but they are not the only avenue nor are they the best one for everyone. I think your sister is somehow struggling with a tiny (or maybe not so tiny) voice in her mind that there was another option she may or may not have considered. That doesn\u2019t make her choice wrong nor does it make your choice wrong. And, yes there is a huge need for wonderful parents for all of the foster children, but that doesn\u2019t mean any family that wants kids is a good fit for foster kids either. To be fair, I have been one to say, and will continue to say, those who are staunchly pro-life need to show that support by somehow helping the foster system either through fostering or donating time and money to the foster system and fighting for better systems, but that doesn\u2019t mean that fostering and adoption should be the only option for those with fertility struggle or that require alternative means to get pregnant", "NTA Bottom line, it\u2019s your choice.", "NTA, your sister was pushing it and being very holier-than-thou, you tried to be polite and turn the idea away, but she persisted.

I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate if you\u2019re anti abortion under all circumstances and then not willing to consider fostering and/or adoption - it ties into the idea of so called pro life people only caring about the unborn not the living \n\nAdoption and fostering are both wonderful things to do if done for the right reasons - but I\u2019ve also seen many cases of people who were adopted sharing stories about how they struggled to come to terms with.", "NTA its wonderful sister chose to go that route. but it's not right for you and your wife. \n\nYou did not say anything against you nephews by wanting you child to be your wifes and look like their mother. \n\nYou sister is projecting on you because she sees the difficulties the children face daily in the system and decided you could help like she did.

OP has to nip that immediately.", "\"And the person telling you that can adopt them.\"\n\nLet's be fair here, the person telling OP this HAS adopted/fostered kids in need. This isn't some random person who also had bio kids but needed to spend money or some cf person, this isn't a \"gacha\" *here* like it is often for conversations like this. Yes, the sister needs to stfu about it, she's in the wrong, but she has adopted kids. That's a thing she's actually done.", "If her sister was dumb enough to confront her in front of those kids, that\u2019s on her sister.  The OP\u2019s honest responses don\u2019t devalue foster families.  But, it\u2019s hard for kids to see that.  Her sister should know not to bring that up in front of her kids knowing the OP will push back and likely say something the kids can misconstrue.", "What\u2019s wrong with the OP being honest about procreating?  Should she have beat around the bush?  Humans have always had the desire to pass down their bloodlines and there is no shame in being honest about it.  She did nothing wrong here at all.  It is disappointing that we put so much stock on genetics when it comes to defining a family, but as a man who was abandoned by his bio, but had one of the greatest men step up and fill that void, I say blood doesn\u2019t mean anything the ME. But that\u2019s just me.", "I mean, true. I was most speaking in general about this particular gotcha, although at least sister has put her money where her mouth is. \n\nAlthough if anything, I'd think the sister should know that it's not for everyone. I know people who have adopted out of foster care as their first choice, too, and although they've spoken highly of it and have been encouraging, they've also recognized that it's not for everyone."]}
