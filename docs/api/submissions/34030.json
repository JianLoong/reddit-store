I don\u2019t keep in contact with my own shitty family and I was happy to be in contact with him every few months. I live alone with my mom coming to stay sometimes for weeks and my bf comes weekends. I\u2019ve been with the bf for months and before that we knew each other too. So I tell my bf right away that the brother wants to come and visit me probably because it\u2019s the month of the anniversary of the death, and my mom will be here too and we don\u2019t see each other that way, etc. His issue is me keeping in contact with my dead boyfriend\u2019s family. I told him he\u2019s never gone through the same thing so he doesn\u2019t understand. But he says if I keep in contact that he\u2019s walking out.

He\u2019s being controlling and insecure. But in my experience, it is hard for people who have never lost a great love too soon to understand what a partner who has is going through. This is often because it forces them to think about what they would do if their partner died and they just can\u2019t face it so they\u2019d rather try to get you to pretend it didn\u2019t happen either. And of course the fear of not living up to someone else whose memory is now sacred. It\u2019s awful and small and wildly insecure, but it\u2019s common. You may find more understanding men among those who have also lost a person.", "NTA. Bf needs the boot.", "and don't let it bump him in the arse on the way out.  He is a complete git.", "Yeah he\u2019s no good OP. Glad you caught this red flag early on. If he\u2019s like this about this sorta thing, it\u2019s not gonna be a healthy relationship. He\u2019s jealous of a dead person. Let him walk out, it\u2019s for the best.", "Agreed and it seems that OP hasn\u2019t shown any signs of loving him more than as a brother which makes her reasonable. But I guess OP should consider talking to Bf so as to try and explain the difference in love that she has to bf and brother.", "What is a LW?", "I don\u2019t think he has a problem with it in that regard. From what OP wrote I think he doesn\u2019t like the fact that OP still communicates with the family of an ex (regardless of how he\u2019s an ex; you\u2019d think he\u2019d have more sympathy). OP NTA, I think you should find someone who has a bit more empathy towards you and what happened."]}
