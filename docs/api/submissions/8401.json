{"id": 8401, "submission_id": "10mayvj", "title": "WIBTA for moving out and effectively making my roommate homeless?", "selftext": "\nSorry for the long post. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. \n\nMy boyfriend Evan [M32] and I [F22] moved into an apartment with our friend Sarah[ F28] and Dana [ F31] last November. Evan and I work during the day while Dana and Sarah bartend, and work evening shifts usually getting home around 11pm-2am.\n\nIn the morning, it\u2019s very chilly and the house is drafty, so at night before bed I\u2019ll turn my heat up and also turn the bathroom heat up a little so it won\u2019t be freezing when I go to get ready. Despite me telling Sarah not to turn it off and that I\u2019ll turn it down before I leave, she turns it completely off. I\u2019ve had several shaking cold morning after I knew I turned the heat up. It\u2019s infuriating. I should be able to be warm in my own home, and this is only one of the many reasons we started to consider moving out. \n\n( She also survives off of our groceries, walks in on us even during the deed,goes out to get drunk every night then comes home loud at 2-3am,asking for bill money 2-3 weeks ahead of when it\u2019s actually due,etc.)\n\nThis month, we got a higher than normal electric bill. Last night, Sarah came home late and was screaming about how the bill was 500 dollars (although she\u2019d only be responsible for 125) and that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t pay that right now\u201d. \n\n(I also left notes by the thermostats asking indirectly for people to leave it alone, or at least between a reasonable temperature.)\n\nShe screamed fuck this note and threw them off the wall and was slamming doors and talking shit on the phone, knowing we could hear her through the extremely thin walls. The bill is not even due for another 2 weeks. She basically threw a tantrum and kept me up when I was trying to sleep for work. \n\nToday, she gave a half ass explanation, saying she freaked out because she has all these bills and rent due and probation fines she didn\u2019t pay, and basically listed off reasons she didn\u2019t have money and overall brushed it off.\n\nSo the roommates and I were discussing maybe just getting our own place that\u2019s more quiet, bigger and has no Sarah. Somehow Sarah found out we were possibility planning on moving out and said if we did she\u2019d basically be homeless and got pouty, stomping around the house and eventually leaving the house without another word. \n\nI know she couldn\u2019t afford the apartment on her own. On the one hand she needs to be an adult and it not our responsibility to cover her so she can go out every night but if she\u2019d really end up homeless I\u2019d feel kinda guilty.

Sarah is 28 and works, yet is complaining she can\u2019t afford the bills or her fines or her own groceries. You\u2019re NTA because she cant get her crap together.", "NTA. Sarah did this to herself. Move out.", "So she's annoying as all hell, then finds out you're leaving because she's annoying as all hell, then proceeds to be annoying as all hell... Again! You're NTA And I really suggest getting out as soon as possible because this is not going to get better and you might just find yourself with some bills related to her.\n\nOh, and it's not that she can't pay her bills.... it's because she's going out drinking and drinking up all her money!\n\nEdit typo", "Normally, I'd say if your heat is causing the electric bill to be higher, then the portion of the bill you pay should be bigger.  But, since it sounds like Sarah eats your food, maybe that works itself out. I'd say it depends on how much she eats and how much extra heat you use (when she isn't turning it off)\n\nOther than that, YWNBTA so long as you give her appropriate notice and no lease is broken.\n\nTime for Sarah to stand on her own two feet.  You can't feel responsible for another adult who should be able to  take care of themselves.  She can find other roommates or a smaller apartment.", "NTA. It\u2019s an unpleasant living environment.", "Not your circus not your monkey. She'll have to find other roommates and hopefully she'll stop being annoying.", "Sounds like Sarah needs to get her shit together.  That\u2019s on her, not on you.  She\u2019s been a horrible roommate and you owe her nothing you aren\u2019t legally obligated to.  That sounds cold and heartless but this woman sounds like she needs a wake up call and you all moving out just might be it or she\u2019ll get some other roommates and the cycle continues.  Either way not your problem!", "NTA. She is almost 30, i know everything is pretty expensive right now, but she should be able to budget and save for her monthly costs accordingly. She willingly moved somewhere knowing what it would cost to live there, if she didn\u2019t have the money she should\u2019ve chosen somewhere else, or been honest from the beginning that it was out of budget and maybe the 3 of you would have been willing to pay say $50 more a month each to lessen her stress a bit and make the living situation work. \n\nI had a roommate who would eat all of my groceries and open things before I even got the chance to, and eventually I had to sit her down and say if she doesnt like going grocery shopping and wants me to do that for the both of us I have no issue but that if she\u2019s eating my groceries she\u2019ll also be paying half of the grocery costs, regardless of if she doesnt want to eat/doesnt like certain things I get. I started automatically venmo requesting her each time i went to the store. I also would keep a lot of nonperishable items in my room in an organizer because i was over her eating everything i bought. Eventually she started buying her own stuff. \n\nI also stopped paying her half of things. There were months she said she couldn\u2019t afford wifi or electric (wifi was $13/month each) and i would call her out on the fact that if you can afford to go to the bars every night spending $50 on alcohol, buy fake lashes, vapes, etc. then you can afford wifi, and told her i was done paying her half and she owed me what i had been paying. Bills come before alcohol or fun things. \n\nGet a lock on your door, either one of those under the door locks or one that slides in between the door frame and door itself since most apartments won\u2019t allow you to change locks/door handles without approval. If you do change it make sure to keep the old one to change back. Also get a space heater for your room. That\u2019ll solve the thermostat issue if she refuses to leave it alone. \n\nLastly, if you do end up moving, do it with proper notice to her. If you wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck paying 4x your normal bills randomly then don\u2019t do the same to her, even if she is shitty. Give her at least 2 weeks to a months notice, just like you would the leasing office. Also make sure to pay out whatever you owe to break your portion of the lease. If she decides to stay and your name is still on bills and she doesn\u2019t pay them then your credit will suffer as well. \n\nSounds like she needs some real help with alcohol addiction, budgeting, and maybe mental health issues.", "NTA. Her future is not your responsibility.", "Asshole or not, doesnt matter... leave that place fast", "Like we say in my country: \"you aren't an elephant to have a big child\". \n\nIn short: she is not your responsibility, go and live your life w your partner", "ESH\n\n> at night before bed I\u2019ll turn my heat up and also turn the bathroom heat up a little so it won\u2019t be freezing when I go to get ready\n\nOh my actual god.\n\nGet a thermostat you can **program** and stop wasting all that heat *while you're fucking ASLEEP*.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you do make them your problem they are not Evan's or Dana's problems so don't even think about including them in this. My advice is walk away unless she starts making serious changes in her life choices and attitude, even then I would be really hesitant to get involved so as soon as your lease allows I'd be seriously thinking of moving out. Yes she is your friend but at her age she is not acting at all like a friend should.", "NTA.  If she wants people to enable her irresponsible behavior and finances, the least she can do is be pleasant to live with.  I'd say if you feel extra guilty, give her 90 days official notice so she can shop for another set of roommates or find a place. Anything beyond that \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA, but assuming you\u2019re either not on the lease or in a month to month rental situation?  Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem sustainable. She can\u2019t afford her own food, let alone utilities but is drowning her sorrows in alcohol.", "NTA you don't owe her a thing.

However, it's not your responsibility to ensure that she has a place to live. Definitely understand why you would move out.", "YWNBTA. She FAFO. She made herself intolerable. Now she will have to live with the consequences.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your child, so why is she acting like one?", "I find five year old adults exhausting. \n\nMove somewhere without Sarah and enjoy your life. Either that or tell her to sling her hook so you can all stay where you are.\n\nNTA but remember to smile at her when you, or she, leave.", "NAH. She does not respect your privacy, reasonable requests nor do her fair share.  If it makes you feel any better? People like her don\u2019t stay homeless.  She will find someone else to leech off of. They always land on their feet. Usually at someone else\u2019s expense. Do what you need to do. She will be fine.", "Lol on top she\u2019s 28, but acting like an immature teenager who\u2019s squatting her parents basement (throwing tantrums\u2026 yikes).", "Usually, I'd be in agreement, but OP says in the post it's a rental, so she doesn't have a choice to change it", "They pop right off. I've absolutely swapped thermostats in rentals. You stick the shit one back on when you move.", "ESH. Running heating overnight so you won't feel cold first thing in the morning is a waste of everybody's money. Can you not put he heating, or some heating, on a timer?", "Nta. I wouldn't want to live with an alcoholic."]}
