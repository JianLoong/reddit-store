He said it was to be closer to his school which at the time I understood because he was commuting almost an hour and a half and his friend only lived 15ish minutes away. He still came and stayed at my place on the weekends and I would go there sometimes when I got off work on weekdays. \n\nTurns out he had been cheating on me with his friend for most of our relationship. I ended the relationship a few weeks after I found out  (I thought it just started after he moved in, not the entire relationship so I thought maybe we could wirk past it.) \n\nAnyways, once I found out the extent I called it off. For the most part I either tell people who ask why we broke up that we just didn't  work anymore or that he just cheated. \n\nI did however tell my immediate family the whole truth because I didn't feel like I should have to keep it from them and I needed them to understand how and why it ended, and it felt unfair to me that I should have to keep that to myself. It wasn't  made public by any means and the only people who know the truth are my family. \n\nHe apparently  reached out to my sister to \"see how I was doing\" a few days ago and she went off on him, she couldn't  recall all that she said but she mentioned  that she knew everything and now my ex is blowing up my phone and trashing me on his socials because I outed him and hes not even gay. \n\nSo basically my question aita for outing him.", "created_utc": 1691358700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15k1rom/aita_for_outing_my_ex/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason you broke up wasn't because he cheated on you with a man, the reason you broke up is because he cheated. He didn't say \"don't tell anyone\". You didn't exactly post it on Facebook. You just told your immediate family, and as they are your support system you had every right to do so because he involved you in his sexual identity crisis and had it a way that was maximally hurtful to you. It is not your job to run PR for his internalized homophobia.", "NTA. Seriously? I understand outing someone is a huge asshole move, as others have explained, but wtf? He cheated. Plain and simple. Not even just a one time thing. He outed himself in my opinion. Could\u2019ve just broke up with you before he cheated, or before you found out. That\u2019s on him. I don\u2019t sympathize with a cheater.", "NTA.  He cheated with another man - for your entire relationship - so he is gay or bi - he is not straight, now is he.", "NTA. Unless telling your immediate family/support network would possibly endanger him, then he's out of line. He cheated on you with a man, he can't say it's unfair to him when he made this mess. You're already being polite/nice by being vague with other people.", "NTA - You didn't out him. People asked you what happened and you responded with the truth that he cheated. You didn't leave him because he was with a man, you left him because you believe in mongamy and he was with another person...just so happened that the other person he decided to cheat on you with was a man. You would of left him just the same if it was a women. You have the right to tell the truth, not your fault he decided to cheat on you with a man which resulted in him outing himself. He doesn't get to cheat and then expect you to lie for him as to why you broke up. You get to have support from your family in your time of need.\n\nAlso he might be more bi or have internalized homophobia which isn't your fault. Don't let some cheating loser bring you down.", "NTA, he cheating on you, you're not abligated to keep that a secret.  Maybe he shouldn't have cheated.", "NTA. He shouldn't have cheated in the first place.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI would say your sister is. You were cheated on and felt close enough with your immediate family to tell them the details i.e he cheated on you with someone they knew of. The fact your sister felt comfortable enough going off on him & expressing she knew those intimate details was not okay.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter who he cheated with, he still cheated.", "NTA you are allowed to talk to your family. If you had run around and told everyone, that would have been messed up. But you were seeking solace in your family and no one can fault you for that. He's obviously uncomfortable with sexuality and while that is sad, it is not your problem.", "He's gay. \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter who he cheated with, but that he cheated. Unless you made a specific big to di over it being same sex, it\u2019s the cheating that broke the engagement\u2026not that it was a same sex AP.", "NTA.. but you\u2019re walking a fine line. It\u2019s very not-cool to out anyone, it could put them in danger, and it also just sounds like speculation if he says he\u2019s not gay.. however.. he did cheat. And it\u2019s not like you told the whole world or his own family that he\u2019s sleeping with a man, you just shared what happened with your family.  \n\nAlso that\u2019s very weird he reached out to your sister after CHEATING on you\u2026 hope you\u2019re doing okay.", "Yup absolutely the asshole. I keep seeing everyone being so stuck the cheating thing. Let's take a minute and think about why a gay person might not feel comfortable being open about having a same sex partner ie safety. So cheating is a way for this to happen safely. Now was a shit thing to do? Yes. The person who will suffer the most is the gay person. YTA x a million. You never out some.", "YTA. **Never** out someone without consent. There are usually many reasons that families don\u2019t know about someone\u2019s orientation. It may just be that they\u2019re not ready to come out, but that\u2019s not your choice to make. Plenty of people are fine with others being LGBTQ+ but will react *horribly* if they found out their kid was.\n\nEDIT: Really disturbing to see how many people think that it\u2019s fine to do this just because someone cheated. That doesn\u2019t make it right to put them in danger. Wild shit.", "ESH. It\u2019s never ever ever okay to out someone. It can be very dangerous. You could have said he cheated without saying who it was with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not like OP\u2019s sister told anyone, she only confronted the cheater when he called. Ex had no right to call OP\u2019s sister. Only an idiot would call his ex gf\u2019s sister after cheating on her & not expect to get yelled at. NTA OP", "So bi people dont exist?", "NTA BTW.", "I agree which is why I posted, I absolutely did not tell his family for that reason. I only talked about it to my immediate family, I also didn't go to my family saying he was gay and that's why we broke up, I was hurt and I told them he cheated on me with his roommate/ friend who has been around my family on many occasions and who they all knew well.", "How would you have preferred her to answer the questions then?", "Nope. He outed himself when he cheated and got caught. It isn\u2019t OPs responsibility to lie for him or, frankly, to protect him.\n\nSource: am gay; do not use my sexuality to manipulate others into hiding my shitty behavior.", "What danger is he in? He's the one threatening OP. Just because he's LGBT doesn't mean he gets to treat a person like shit and have them cover for him. He should have thought of that", "So she should have lied to her family?", "*Holding a giant eraser.*\nWhy, what have you heard?", "Oh yes. That exists too. Pardon me.", "O think you didn't need to tell them with who he cheated, just that he cheated... Wouldn't have been a lie and wouldn't have outed him...", "Seems like you have good intentions. I wouldn\u2019t dwell on it too much. Just learn and avoid it in the future. Peace. :)", "Not at all. It\u2019s none of their business. A personal need for revenge doesn\u2019t outweigh someone\u2019s safety.", "Nope. Just tell them nicely that it\u2019s not their information to have.", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "Please point out where she was looking for revenge?  I must have missed that.", "She said she was feeling angry. There\u2019s only so much you can do with that info. Either way, it\u2019s never cool to do this shit.", "Gotcha she had no right to privately seek emotional support from her immediate family.", "You do not have to tell them about it being with another man. You literally only have to say he cheated. It\u2019s not that hard to be considerate of others\u2019 safety even if they\u2019ve treated you badly.\n\nETA: Why are you even so upset about this? If you check my comment, OP even admitted to second guessing the admission. You don\u2019t need to give a play by play to get emotional support.", "I mentioned who it was because I considered the roomate a close friend, he was friends with my fiance since I met him so over the years I had gotten close to him and so had my family. He's come to every holiday dinner for the past 6 years as well as just random family get togethers. It would have been odd for him to just stop coming over around the same time we split. I wasn't even really thinking at the time that I was outing him. And I wasn't trying to get revenge at all.", "Fair enough! I get that you weren\u2019t thinking about it, but it\u2019s always worth taking an extra minute in sticky situations like this.", "Could have just said he took your ex's side... wouldn't have been a lie...\n\nYou were emotional and trying to get support, but you could have had that support without outing anyone... \n\nFor it's ESH..."]}
