Eventually he wound up living alone , I kept looking out for him in his old age and last thing I said is that he doest have to be alone, and he still has family, he shrugged it off and he said his family was all dead.

You would have to ask yourself - had you not been raised by your own family and adopted out, would they have tried to find you after 'turning their lives around'?", "That's horrifying! They didn't have you at the hospital and decide to give you up and tell them that. They didn't leave you at a fire department, or ask your grandma grandparents if they wanted you. They purposely had you in a third world country so that they wouldn't get caught abandoning you! They knew what they were doing and they planned it out! The only thing that backfired was that the country actually cared enough to figure out who you were and get you to your family. I bet they were horrified when they realized that! \n\nThey fully intended for the family to never find out that they abandoned you both!

They didn't give you guys up for adoption or leave the hospital with contact info for the rest of the family. They abandoned you. Which, being the addicts and messed up people they were, might be something that could be moved past if they'd tried to make things right once they got their lives together. But they then waited another 9 years before popping up like 'hi, let's be friends'.\n\nThe fact that you even managed to be cordial with them is impressive, honestly.

It is bad enough that they abandoned you, but even worse that they did so in a completely foreign country.", "NTA. Hard decisions come with a lot of thought and plans to mitigate the damage. Leaving your newborns in a hospital in a foreign country with no effort to arrange guardianship was not a hard decision, it was a selfish one. \n\nIf your bio parents want to build a relationship with you, they need to take responsibility for how selfish and awful they were, not feed you lies to make themselves look better.", "NTA they are worse than animals so who cares, a dog would fight to the death for their puppies but they were perfectly happy to leave you and bro to fate unknown.", "NTA.

They are lucky that you even talk to them.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who was estranged from her biomom, I would encourage you and your brother to get into therapy and talk this through. You're absolutely not wrong to have said what you did or even if you don't want any kind of relationahip with them moving forward, but it's complicated when other people do. You need to vent outside your family, figure out your boundaries, and rehearse communicating those in order to protect yourself and your relationships with your other family.\n\nFor your own sake, I'd also encourage you to consider that what your biomom said may have been true from her point of view. She made a really bad decision. A disqualifying decision. But she might have genuinely made a hard decision in a really dumb way. Addicts aren't exactly known for their critical thinking or problem solving skills. But she should absolutely be prepared to hear that you don't and may never trust her if she truly wants to make amends.

Even if it is true, that is some thing you do not need to hear at this point, only if you asked them and wanted to hear what they had to say which I don\u2019t think was the case. This is about your feelings and your twins feelings only at this point. Unless you want to go there with them, they should keep it to themselves and deal. You\u2019re right to think if it was so hard, why they never tried to right their wrong. I can\u2019t believe they went there with you.

They were addicts then. Their families didn't embrace their relationship. What they did was in fact in your best interest. \n\nI understand you feel abandoned. I can assume you have gone through periods of asking why you weren't enough, periods of asking why they didn't try, periods of saying and feeling hatred.

It sounds like they are trying to do that work now, and while you're absolutely within your rights to feel the way you do and don't need to trust them or accept them back in to your life, I do think you should refrain from telling them how you think others in the family do or should feel about them, because they're all adults who can speak for themselves. your story about the reasons behind your bio parents' choices is your own story, colored by the people who raised you - the family who tried to split them up and disowned them - and it almost certainly does not look like their story.

The trauma stays with you forever and shapes your life in so many different ways either way but I think a child knowing the parent and  hoping for a parent to be there for them and never being able to count on them is so much worse.

It didn't affect much to the South. \n\nSri Lanka has a very good healthcare system and has the best HDI ranking in South Asia. Even during an economic crisis, Sri Lanka's poverty rates are still way lower than India. \n\nThey're very under developed in many areas, but health care and social systems aren't among them.", "They may want to assuage their guilt by having you absolve them. You do not owe them that and you may even suffer psychologically from doing it. It\u2019s really up to you. NTA, at all. Even if you rejected them completely it would be ok ethically for you to do so.", "Are they too old to have other children now? Maybe they couldn't have a do-over baby, so they've decided to try with you and your brother/s", "If they're lying to you, they're not there to be respectful and loving after 24 years, and I would definitely agree with your post that they're lying about leaving you two being difficult. I'm not saying \"don't try,\" but rather, set clear boundaries for yourself. They might be doing a long con expecting care and housing in their old age, or they could be regretful. I do wish you the best of luck, but I hope you stay prepared for less than that.", "Easier term is Global South or Developing Country", "I don't think they were in the right mindset to do that. We have reached the records in Srilanka and it was clear that my father was high from god knows what and my mother was in a manic episode during that time. I am just glad that my mother has stopped drinking and using drugs during  pregnancy so we weren't born with fetal alcohol syndrome or other issues.", "because they are their brother and sister, and they probably feel partly responsible for their siblings' behavior growing up.", "Ok_Tour3509. That 3rd paragraph has great examples of things to say to family and questions to ask bio parents", "That\u2019s at least something. She at least gave you that.

I don\u2019t see that you have anything to gain from it. You\u2019ll just have to struggle to figure out a way to let them in your life which is completely unfair to you. It\u2019s also ok to tell your family you don\u2019t want anything to do with your birth parents. That you don\u2019t want them talking to your birth parents about you and if they can\u2019t abide by that then maybe limit your contact with your family until they understand you\u2019re serious about it. \n\nI believe in the power of apologies. But sometimes you can\u2019t unring a bell. Things are just the way they are. Even if your brother can empathize with them it doesn\u2019t sound like they were properly sorry for you and your brother the babies they left behind. They seem more sorry they have to live with the guilt because they know they\u2019re bad people. You do what\u2019s right for you.", "Ok I am going to say something challenging and I don\u2019t mean to invalidate but more push an idea for the sake of empathy\u2026.ok you say you were suicidal and struggled to cope especially due to a. diagnosis\u2026.addiction is seen as a DISEASE, they were sick, mentally ill. It does not condone what they did to you, but grace and forgiveness can also help heal this disease when there is demonstrative change. They clearly are not the same people they were. The statement \u201cit was the hardest thing ever to give you up\u201d isn\u2019t to illicit sympathy, I think. Rather to understand \u201cyou were not easily rejected, i feel guilt\u201d you don\u2019t need to forgive but I think empathy for the family members doesn\u2019t hurt.", "You don't have to understand their perspective until you want to. You got done dirty (to put it insultingly mildly)and this is a huge adjustment and a lot to process. I think the most you should do is not burn the bridge, but you don't have to repair till or if you feel like it. I dont mean you cant be blunt or honest, just nothing intentionally cruel that could destroy any chance of reconciliation. Some day you might be open to a relationship so it would be good to keep that option available. As for guilt, sometimes it can be about control. There is a steve Carrell movie with hollywood's glorious god Timothy challamet that talks about it a bit. See they couldn't control your mom's drug use, they couldn't force her to get clean or get help. They could have taken her to rehab  after rehab but unless she wanted to get clean it was pointless. It can be like watching someone walk into a burning building and just standing there watching them do it. But if it's their fault they have control, if they could have prevented it, there is hope they can fix it. maybe it brings them guilt but if they have control they can still do something. But its just a theory.\n\nHowever you also can't control your family, and how they feel or act. Maybe it might help to simply focus on your relationship with them and not talk about mom, keep them seperate. instead of focusing on why they are doing what they are doing you focus on yourself and your feelings and mental health.\n\nAnd definitely call up a therapist especially if you have had suicidal ideation. this is a lot to process and deal with and I'm sure just being able to talk about how you feel in a safe space where you can whatever you want will help immensely.\n\nI'm sorry you guys are going through this I can't imagine how hard it is but take care of yourself and hang in there.\n\nAlso you might try watching/reading my sweet boy (i think thats it name?). It's an autobiography of a father whose son was addicted to drugs and what that was like. Not to try and gain sympathy for your folks but if you feel understanding what they might have been going through would you it might be worth a read.", "You feel however you feel.  Your brother isn\u2019t turning against you for how he feels.  I\u2019m not usually one to jump straight to the therapy train, but in this case it would probably be beneficial especially if they\u2019re going to stick around.", "It was probably difficult to be the youngest child in a family where the siblings were already adults and the parents were already older and that may justify some bad behavior or distancing, but not abandoning newborns in another country.", "Ribbed, but not for anyone\u2019s pleasure", "The dildo of consequences is often seasoned with a fine coating of 40 grit sand and chili powder", "You're right it's a disease. It's also an explanation not an excuse. The terribleness of addiction does not diminish or negate the horrible thing they did. It does not make it better or not their fault. Their actions still have consequences. Op isn't a bad person or asshole for being angry and unforgiving of them. And he has very little reason to trust them. They are not entitled to forgiveness just because they got their act together and we're in a real state at the time.\n\nIt's very easy to say \"don't spend your life in hatred show a little empathy\"when aren't the one ditched in a hospital and abandoned your whole life then have them show up and say \"can we be a family now?\"\n\nEmpathy is nice, but they are not entitled to it. And because of what they did they have to earn it.", "I have noted the film and will try to watch it today. Thanks for the suggestion.", "Yes, thank you. Caboose baby here - with a pretty feral GenX upbringing, to boot  - and have yet to steal 50k or abandon newborns in foreign countries. \n\nThere's still time tho", "OP isn\u2019t an asshole, and they\u2019re not ENTITLED to forgiveness, but I do think understanding helps healing, at least internally, even if it doesn\u2019t change your behaviour and you continue to maintain boundaries. You can not accept behaviour but it helps to have it explained to know it wasn\u2019t you as an individual who was rejected."]}
