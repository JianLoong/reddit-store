Eventually he wound up living alone , I kept looking out for him in his old age and last thing I said is that he doest have to be alone, and he still has family, he shrugged it off and he said his family was all dead.

You would have to ask yourself - had you not been raised by your own family and adopted out, would they have tried to find you after 'turning their lives around'?", "That's horrifying! They didn't have you at the hospital and decide to give you up and tell them that. They didn't leave you at a fire department, or ask your grandma grandparents if they wanted you. They purposely had you in a third world country so that they wouldn't get caught abandoning you! They knew what they were doing and they planned it out! The only thing that backfired was that the country actually cared enough to figure out who you were and get you to your family. I bet they were horrified when they realized that! \n\nThey fully intended for the family to never find out that they abandoned you both!

They didn't give you guys up for adoption or leave the hospital with contact info for the rest of the family. They abandoned you. Which, being the addicts and messed up people they were, might be something that could be moved past if they'd tried to make things right once they got their lives together. But they then waited another 9 years before popping up like 'hi, let's be friends'.\n\nThe fact that you even managed to be cordial with them is impressive, honestly.

It is bad enough that they abandoned you, but even worse that they did so in a completely foreign country.", "NTA. Hard decisions come with a lot of thought and plans to mitigate the damage. Leaving your newborns in a hospital in a foreign country with no effort to arrange guardianship was not a hard decision, it was a selfish one. \n\nIf your bio parents want to build a relationship with you, they need to take responsibility for how selfish and awful they were, not feed you lies to make themselves look better.", "NTA they are worse than animals so who cares, a dog would fight to the death for their puppies but they were perfectly happy to leave you and bro to fate unknown.", "NTA.

They are lucky that you even talk to them.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who was estranged from her biomom, I would encourage you and your brother to get into therapy and talk this through. You're absolutely not wrong to have said what you did or even if you don't want any kind of relationahip with them moving forward, but it's complicated when other people do. You need to vent outside your family, figure out your boundaries, and rehearse communicating those in order to protect yourself and your relationships with your other family.\n\nFor your own sake, I'd also encourage you to consider that what your biomom said may have been true from her point of view. She made a really bad decision. A disqualifying decision. But she might have genuinely made a hard decision in a really dumb way. Addicts aren't exactly known for their critical thinking or problem solving skills. But she should absolutely be prepared to hear that you don't and may never trust her if she truly wants to make amends.

Even if it is true, that is some thing you do not need to hear at this point, only if you asked them and wanted to hear what they had to say which I don\u2019t think was the case. This is about your feelings and your twins feelings only at this point. Unless you want to go there with them, they should keep it to themselves and deal. You\u2019re right to think if it was so hard, why they never tried to right their wrong. I can\u2019t believe they went there with you.

They were addicts then. Their families didn't embrace their relationship. What they did was in fact in your best interest. \n\nI understand you feel abandoned. I can assume you have gone through periods of asking why you weren't enough, periods of asking why they didn't try, periods of saying and feeling hatred.

It sounds like they are trying to do that work now, and while you're absolutely within your rights to feel the way you do and don't need to trust them or accept them back in to your life, I do think you should refrain from telling them how you think others in the family do or should feel about them, because they're all adults who can speak for themselves. your story about the reasons behind your bio parents' choices is your own story, colored by the people who raised you - the family who tried to split them up and disowned them - and it almost certainly does not look like their story.

The trauma stays with you forever and shapes your life in so many different ways either way but I think a child knowing the parent and  hoping for a parent to be there for them and never being able to count on them is so much worse.
