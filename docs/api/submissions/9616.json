I didn't say much else because this is my niece's decision and her own feelings on her name, not my own.\n\nSome of my husband's other family members were told about this by SIL and they all agree with SIL that I was wrong.

She may not like her name for many reasons (asthetics, historical connotations, gender identity, etc.) and it doesn't matter why. It's HER name. She's at that precarious age where she has opinions but family still sees her as a kid. Keep being the person she's comfortable being around. There may be something bigger happening and she needs a safe person.", "NTA.\n\nAll you did was give her very sound advice.\n\n>I didn\u2019t say much else because this is my niece's decision and her own feelings on her name, not my own\n\nLiterally like you said, this will be HER decision and HER feelings. Honestly, your SIL sounds like she will continue to call your niece the name she hates even after she changes her name. SIL should be more considerate to her daughter's feelings and not focus on her own. Niece didn\u2019t like this name for over a decade so this isn\u2019t some phase neither", "NTA they should treat your niece as a human being with preferences and feelings and let her choose what she wants to have as her name instead of blame you for letting her know her parents' choices over her own identity are reversible!", "She's 15 and has apparently always hated her name. If SIL hasn't gotten the message yet, she probably never will. Shame.\n\nGood on you though for supporting her. NTA.", "NTA. This isn't a \"phase.\"  She's always hated her name. It helps to tell her she has options.  Quite frankly, I'm really sad that your sister-in-law hasn't helped facilitate this change already. It would be such a great opportunity for her to show some compassion and love towards her daughter and solidify their relationship by allowing her to choose a name that she's always wanted. If she forces her daughter to wait until she's 18 to change her name, it's quite likely her daughter will resent her for it. That might be worth mentioning to sister-in-law.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\n\nYou didn't go to her and give her this new info. She didn't always love her name, and you didn't, so you talked crap and told her to change it.\n\n\nThe fact is that your SIL hates the name her husband picked for her son, called it hideous.  She wants her daughter to keep hers as a form of control over her, as something that she loves.  The thing is a person's name is there identity, and if someone doesn't love their name and feels that strongly about it, they shouldn't keep it due to their mothers feelings.\n\n\nRemind your niece that she isnt responsible for her mothers feelings.  She could always change her middle name and go by that and keep her first if she changes her mind.\n\nI'm named after my great aunt and great great grandmother.  My great aunt hated her name, so she always went by her middle name.  When she died, her given first name was listed as an initial only.", "NTA she\u2019s 15 not 5, you were just making her aware of her options", "Nta, 15 years is old enough to determine what you do or don't like, and she hasn't liked the name since she was 6, that's a whole decade, all you did was inform her of her options. I mean she probably would've figured it out herself anyway.", "NTA - Your niece has clearly been sitting on this issue for a while and this isn't something new that you just brought up out of the blue. Your SIL needs to chill out and realize that she can't control everything and inevitably if your niece does want to change her name when she is old enough there is absolutely nothing she can do about it. If I was your SIL instead of getting annoyed at her confiding in someone she trusts I would be thinking to myself about why my daughter doesn't feel comfortable coming to me about this and how I can support her when it's obviously upsetting her.", "NTA parents pick names because of their own personal reasons but that doesn't mean their children have to like their name. My niece at 13 decided she really didn't like her name. We all now call her by the name she picked. It's not hard to respect your children. You didn't do anything wrong. Chances are that SIL is probably a little jealous that her kiddo went to you. It's important for kids to have someone to talk if they don't feel comfortable talking to their parents and you are one of those people. You have given appropriate information to a child that can help make their life a little better.", "NTA and it\u2019s important to have understanding adults good on you", "INFO: When you say \"traditional\" what do you mean? Does that mean the name is culturally relevant? Or is it an old name?", "NTA\n\nLet them be mad. Never stop being there for her, no matter what they say. Your niece needs you. Your support makes a huge difference. Names are a big part of our identity and to struggle with that is no small thing. Don't let them dismiss her.\n\nShe's surrounded by people who are doing nothing while she struggles with her identity. Having one person that validates her when everyone else is against is so grounding and can help her. \n\nI used to struggle with my name. I did eventually learn to love it, but having people get mad at me for not liking it prolonged my struggle. I was told by most that \"it's a beautiful unique name\" and that I should be thankful I'm not another \"insert common 90s name.\" Having a supportive listening ear helped my struggle end.", "NTA.
