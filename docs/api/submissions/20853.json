As I am sure you have already observed the last couple of weeks, the immediate postpartum period is such a hellscape for so many birth parents. Pain, bleeding, looking a mess, horribly fatigued. My family came to meet our newborn at 4 days old and I wish I had a little bit more time for just our little nuclear family.\n\nIt is very reasonable to want some time to heal and be alone with your newborn.

Please stand by her and continue to respect her wishes.\n\nThe early postpartum period was hard for me with my husband\u2019s large family giving us zero space after our child\u2019s birth. I love them all but I was going through so much and really suffered just trying to people please. Maybe your wife will come around to allowing just grandparents to visit? We did that with the birth of our second child and it was so much better. You could try a compromise but ultimately her requests should be respected. Look into the Fourth Trimester to help put things into perspective.", "NTA. You are the parents now, you get to make the decisions for your family whether *your* parents like it or not. Sometimes with first time grandparents, this is a hard pill to swallow, but stand your ground, they will have to adapt.\n\nReading this brought SO many memories back from when my sister gave birth. She got this shit from both sets of parents. She allowed them 20 minutes in the hospital to meet the baby, and then told everyone \"no visitors for a month\". I saw their jaws literally drop. They couldn't fathom it. How *dare* she, is what their faces said. Whatever. You know what happened? My sister and her husband got the month to themselves, the grandparents stewed in that time but ultimately I think they realized eventually that if they want to see that baby, they have to comply. I hope your parents come to that same realization. You may get some passive aggressive comments about it along the way, but that's their problem, not yours.", "She gets what she needs. If your parents can't understand that, they are TA.\n\nAnd you are best off starting this journey with firm boundaries.

You are being a great husband and therefore a great father to your newborn.", "NTA\n\nBut you can probably try and communicate this more effectively to your family.

Just keep an eye on her to let her heal properly and make sure she doesn\u2019t develop PPD.", "NTA. You are doing the right thing. You obviously understand you are on team wife-son now, not team parents. \n\nYou mother is raising drama because she expects you to fold. Do not. You will set the precedence your boundaries are meaningless and she can do whatever she wants because 'grandbaby.'

Remember this in the future and stand very strong in the boundaries you and your wife set. \n\nKeep your spine shiny and support your wife and son. They are your focus.", "NTA - it literally isnt about them. This is about your wife, your baby and you. Honestly follow your wife's wishes please.

And so it could be risky for a while to have a lot of people over", "NTA for prioritizing your partner\u2019s comfort and health as she recovers from birthing your baby. Your parents will have to get used to the fact that you have started your own little family now and will be putting their needs first. I am wondering if your partner used the wording of not wanting others to be around while she is \u201cso weak\u201d because that to me implies that she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be around her when she isn\u2019t in a state to defend herself or something. I know some people also take it as a pride issue of not wanting to be seen as weak so that could just be it too. Either way you\u2019re NTA and I hope you continue to think of the health, safety, and comfort of your partner and child over the wants of others (even your other family members).", "NTA.\n\nBut newborns change SO fast.

Extra help in those first few weeks was a godsend for us.\n\nNTA\u2026.. but dang!", "You and her need to find a compromise that works. It\u2019s not wrong to want to see family and it\u2019s not wrong to want to protect yourself as your wife is doing. She won\u2019t know how she feels. There\u2019s a real chance of postpartum depression, and the idea of someone passing her baby along might be too much. It could cause resentment with the party that is passing the child along. Where I draw the line is if it\u2019s selective. If she\u2019s able to watch her family and be around the baby but not yours then there\u2019s a problem, but if it\u2019s across the board, I find it pretty fair.", "NTA. Honestly, I would feel devastated if I couldn\u2019t see my newborn grandson, on the other hand times have changed and new moms want time to \u201cbond\u201d without interruptions and time to heal without the burden of hosting anyone. Personally I would have loved to have someone bring a meal and do a couple loads of laundry while I napped. Send your mom lots of photos and maybe plan a party to introduce the baby to your families. If your wife is amenable, ask your mom to help you plan.", "Sorry your partner is so uncomfortable with people seeing her in a compromised state. My daughter had an unplanned c-section. She welcomed any and all help in the beginning weeks of her recovery. It allowed me and her in-laws to assist her and her husband. We always asked, \"What would you like us to do today?\" Maybe your partner doesn't think people would really help her or listen to her needs. Or she does not know how to accept help. My granddaughter's  birth was almost 5 months ago and I am doing laundry for the family right now. I", "ESH. My wife & I had the same experience with our first. He was over due. They tried four more than 24 hours to induce birth and it ended in an emergency c-section as things started to go sideways. \n\nI can really understand a couple days of privacy. But a *month*? And why would the baby need privacy when mom is \"weak\"? \n\nMom is beyond exhausted and needs weeks of recovery, you can support her by allowing family to visit the baby separately and to visit mom in limited time/quantity with you kicking them out when she's had enough. The extended family sucks by playing victim, but their objection makes more sense than a month of seclusion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
