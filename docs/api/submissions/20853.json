It\u2019s about your wife needing you and supporting her decision in waiting.", "\u201cAnd honestly if it where only up to me, I would probably invite them, *just so I can avoid this drama*.\u201d\n\nRead that again. And again. In your own words, you would have them over not to share your joy or because you want them there, but to avoid drama. That cannot and should not trump your partner\u2019s recovery.\n\nNTA. Keep holding firm on this boundary. Let your partner recover in privacy.\n\nCongrats on the birth of your son!", "NTA\n\nAs parents you need to do what you need to do.\n\nIf they can't understand this, it's them being the ass. You gave them an opportunity to meet the baby and they are acting like unsupportive pricks.", "NTA. This is about you, your wife and your baby first and foremost. She isn't withholding the baby forever. She wants time to adjust to normal life before visitors come. You absolutely should have your wife's back on this, what she is asking isn't very unreasonable. Good for you for backing her, you're parents are the ones being unreasonable.", "NTA. I had 4 c sections Been married to my husband for 32 years and one very big  reason is cause he always has my back.  So have her back \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. Your wife just had a major surgery. She\u2019s allowed to not want people around while she also figures out how to parent a newborn and recover. Your parents are AH\u2019s for thinking your son has anything to do with them.", "NTA. As I am sure you have already observed the last couple of weeks, the immediate postpartum period is such a hellscape for so many birth parents. Pain, bleeding, looking a mess, horribly fatigued. My family came to meet our newborn at 4 days old and I wish I had a little bit more time for just our little nuclear family.\n\nIt is very reasonable to want some time to heal and be alone with your newborn. Sounds like this period is almost up- maybe your wife would be comfortable with something more like 3 weeks? That\u2019s only 1 more week!", "NTA and not selfish\u2014your wife needs rest and you both need time to adjust to having a baby in the home. At the end of the day, the reasoning doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s your baby and you get to set the boundaries. Your relatives aren\u2019t entitled to time with the baby.", "NTA.\n\nReading this took me back to when we had our first child in 2018. Becoming a mom, especially through a traumatic birth experience, is life altering and your wife is asking for space and time to adjust. Please stand by her and continue to respect her wishes.\n\nThe early postpartum period was hard for me with my husband\u2019s large family giving us zero space after our child\u2019s birth. I love them all but I was going through so much and really suffered just trying to people please. Maybe your wife will come around to allowing just grandparents to visit? We did that with the birth of our second child and it was so much better. You could try a compromise but ultimately her requests should be respected. Look into the Fourth Trimester to help put things into perspective.", "NTA. You are the parents now, you get to make the decisions for your family whether *your* parents like it or not. Sometimes with first time grandparents, this is a hard pill to swallow, but stand your ground, they will have to adapt.\n\nReading this brought SO many memories back from when my sister gave birth. She got this shit from both sets of parents. She allowed them 20 minutes in the hospital to meet the baby, and then told everyone \"no visitors for a month\". I saw their jaws literally drop. They couldn't fathom it. How *dare* she, is what their faces said. Whatever. You know what happened? My sister and her husband got the month to themselves, the grandparents stewed in that time but ultimately I think they realized eventually that if they want to see that baby, they have to comply. I hope your parents come to that same realization. You may get some passive aggressive comments about it along the way, but that's their problem, not yours.", "She gets what she needs. If your parents can't understand that, they are TA.\n\nAnd you are best off starting this journey with firm boundaries. Which means not allowing yourself to be bulldozed into 'compromise'; doing that will only teach them that bulldozing pays off. *Not* a lesson you want to be bestowing, right now.", "NTA... thank you for standing up for your partner.", "NTA.\n\n1. You don't have to \"share your happiness\" all the time. And that does not make you selfish.\n\n2. This is the time for your wife to recover and for you to bond as a family. You do not have to share that with anyone. If anyone is too self centered to not respect your boundaries, then it is their problem not yours. And your wife is the one who just delivered a baby by having major abdominal surgery. She gets to decide when she is ready for visitors. \n\n3. You are doing the right thing. You are being a great husband and therefore a great father to your newborn.", "NTA\n\nBut you can probably try and communicate this more effectively to your family. From the post it doesn't sound like there is any animosity between anyone involved, more so a misunderstanding.\n\nAlso good job backing up your partner, especially in this situation. Don't budge on that.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t singling them out.\n\nYour wife clearly finds them understandably hard work. \n\nSet those boundaries NOW!", "NTA. It's your baby, only you and your partner get to decide who sees him. Apart from that, reasonable people would understand that you'd want this time for your immediate family rather than for extended relatives.", "NTA.  Your wife is certainly not up to even attempting to entertain anyone at this point nor does she need additional noises or people popping their heads in to converse with her.  Just keep an eye on her to let her heal properly and make sure she doesn\u2019t develop PPD.", "NTA. You are doing the right thing. You obviously understand you are on team wife-son now, not team parents. \n\nYou mother is raising drama because she expects you to fold. Do not. You will set the precedence your boundaries are meaningless and she can do whatever she wants because 'grandbaby.' She is making it very clear that she does not respect wife, she only cares about 'grandbaby.' Remember this in the future and stand very strong in the boundaries you and your wife set. \n\nKeep your spine shiny and support your wife and son. They are your focus.", "NTA - it literally isnt about them. This is about your wife, your baby and you. Honestly follow your wife's wishes please. You are not being bad for not allowing them to come over!\n\nEdit: also be in mind that a newborn doesn't have the best immune system yet. And so it could be risky for a while to have a lot of people over", "NTA for prioritizing your partner\u2019s comfort and health as she recovers from birthing your baby. Your parents will have to get used to the fact that you have started your own little family now and will be putting their needs first. I am wondering if your partner used the wording of not wanting others to be around while she is \u201cso weak\u201d because that to me implies that she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be around her when she isn\u2019t in a state to defend herself or something. I know some people also take it as a pride issue of not wanting to be seen as weak so that could just be it too. Either way you\u2019re NTA and I hope you continue to think of the health, safety, and comfort of your partner and child over the wants of others (even your other family members).", "NTA.\n\nBut newborns change SO fast. In 4 weeks, your bundle of joy will be different. And they will miss enjoying it. And can\u2019t get it back.\n\nDoes that mean you should cave? Not at all.\n\nJust trying to explain why they are so disappointed. \n\nPS - Not saying this is the case but Reddit has jaded me\u2026be sure this isn\u2019t the start of pattern of your wife excluding your parents. This is as common as the Just No MILs. (And be sure your parents are not turning in to Just No ILs either).", "NTA if she refuses to see family it\u2019s up to her as odd as it might be", "I find it fascinating that someone weak and recovering from a surgery, whilst caring for a newborn, would refuse any and all help and company.\n\nLook, in the end it is your decision, you and your wife. \n\nI personally think it is a silly decision, but you\u2019ve every right to make it. Extra help in those first few weeks was a godsend for us.\n\nNTA\u2026.. but dang!", "You and her need to find a compromise that works. It\u2019s not wrong to want to see family and it\u2019s not wrong to want to protect yourself as your wife is doing. She won\u2019t know how she feels. There\u2019s a real chance of postpartum depression, and the idea of someone passing her baby along might be too much. It could cause resentment with the party that is passing the child along. Where I draw the line is if it\u2019s selective. If she\u2019s able to watch her family and be around the baby but not yours then there\u2019s a problem, but if it\u2019s across the board, I find it pretty fair.", "NTA. Honestly, I would feel devastated if I couldn\u2019t see my newborn grandson, on the other hand times have changed and new moms want time to \u201cbond\u201d without interruptions and time to heal without the burden of hosting anyone. Personally I would have loved to have someone bring a meal and do a couple loads of laundry while I napped. Send your mom lots of photos and maybe plan a party to introduce the baby to your families. If your wife is amenable, ask your mom to help you plan.", "Sorry your partner is so uncomfortable with people seeing her in a compromised state. My daughter had an unplanned c-section. She welcomed any and all help in the beginning weeks of her recovery. It allowed me and her in-laws to assist her and her husband. We always asked, \"What would you like us to do today?\" Maybe your partner doesn't think people would really help her or listen to her needs. Or she does not know how to accept help. My granddaughter's  birth was almost 5 months ago and I am doing laundry for the family right now. I", "ESH. My wife & I had the same experience with our first. He was over due. They tried four more than 24 hours to induce birth and it ended in an emergency c-section as things started to go sideways. \n\nI can really understand a couple days of privacy. But a *month*? And why would the baby need privacy when mom is \"weak\"? \n\nMom is beyond exhausted and needs weeks of recovery, you can support her by allowing family to visit the baby separately and to visit mom in limited time/quantity with you kicking them out when she's had enough. The extended family sucks by playing victim, but their objection makes more sense than a month of seclusion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This isn't hard to understand at all.", "Problem is, if you have visitors you have to be \u201con\u201d.

But in the end it turned out fine. We're ordering groceries online. I'm doing all the house chores and taking care of her and the little one and while it's been hard the first few days I think we've found our rhythm now.", "A lot of times, when family comes over to help with the baby, all they do is cuddle the baby thinking that's helping and take away from mother child bonding.

It\u2019s one thing if they\u2019re supportive and are there for the parents as well as the grandchild but you are right more often than not people become self-centered, and it can go wild pretty fast, but I also believe third to parents involved in a birth, and there should be compromises.
