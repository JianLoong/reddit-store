As I am sure you have already observed the last couple of weeks, the immediate postpartum period is such a hellscape for so many birth parents. Pain, bleeding, looking a mess, horribly fatigued. My family came to meet our newborn at 4 days old and I wish I had a little bit more time for just our little nuclear family.\n\nIt is very reasonable to want some time to heal and be alone with your newborn.

Please stand by her and continue to respect her wishes.\n\nThe early postpartum period was hard for me with my husband\u2019s large family giving us zero space after our child\u2019s birth. I love them all but I was going through so much and really suffered just trying to people please. Maybe your wife will come around to allowing just grandparents to visit? We did that with the birth of our second child and it was so much better. You could try a compromise but ultimately her requests should be respected. Look into the Fourth Trimester to help put things into perspective.", "NTA. You are the parents now, you get to make the decisions for your family whether *your* parents like it or not. Sometimes with first time grandparents, this is a hard pill to swallow, but stand your ground, they will have to adapt.\n\nReading this brought SO many memories back from when my sister gave birth. She got this shit from both sets of parents. She allowed them 20 minutes in the hospital to meet the baby, and then told everyone \"no visitors for a month\". I saw their jaws literally drop. They couldn't fathom it. How *dare* she, is what their faces said. Whatever. You know what happened? My sister and her husband got the month to themselves, the grandparents stewed in that time but ultimately I think they realized eventually that if they want to see that baby, they have to comply. I hope your parents come to that same realization. You may get some passive aggressive comments about it along the way, but that's their problem, not yours.", "She gets what she needs.

You obviously understand you are on team wife-son now, not team parents. \n\nYou mother is raising drama because she expects you to fold. Do not. You will set the precedence your boundaries are meaningless and she can do whatever she wants because 'grandbaby.'

Your parents will have to get used to the fact that you have started your own little family now and will be putting their needs first. I am wondering if your partner used the wording of not wanting others to be around while she is \u201cso weak\u201d because that to me implies that she doesn\u2019t trust your family to be around her when she isn\u2019t in a state to defend herself or something. I know some people also take it as a pride issue of not wanting to be seen as weak so that could just be it too.

Extra help in those first few weeks was a godsend for us.\n\nNTA\u2026.. but dang!", "You and her need to find a compromise that works. It\u2019s not wrong to want to see family and it\u2019s not wrong to want to protect yourself as your wife is doing. She won\u2019t know how she feels. There\u2019s a real chance of postpartum depression, and the idea of someone passing her baby along might be too much. It could cause resentment with the party that is passing the child along. Where I draw the line is if it\u2019s selective. If she\u2019s able to watch her family and be around the baby but not yours then there\u2019s a problem, but if it\u2019s across the board, I find it pretty fair.", "NTA. Honestly, I would feel devastated if I couldn\u2019t see my newborn grandson, on the other hand times have changed and new moms want time to \u201cbond\u201d without interruptions and time to heal without the burden of hosting anyone. Personally I would have loved to have someone bring a meal and do a couple loads of laundry while I napped. Send your mom lots of photos and maybe plan a party to introduce the baby to your families. If your wife is amenable, ask your mom to help you plan.", "Sorry your partner is so uncomfortable with people seeing her in a compromised state. My daughter had an unplanned c-section. She welcomed any and all help in the beginning weeks of her recovery. It allowed me and her in-laws to assist her and her husband. We always asked, \"What would you like us to do today?\" Maybe your partner doesn't think people would really help her or listen to her needs. Or she does not know how to accept help. My granddaughter's  birth was almost 5 months ago and I am doing laundry for the family right now. I", "ESH. My wife & I had the same experience with our first. He was over due. They tried four more than 24 hours to induce birth and it ended in an emergency c-section as things started to go sideways. \n\nI can really understand a couple days of privacy. But a *month*? And why would the baby need privacy when mom is \"weak\"? \n\nMom is beyond exhausted and needs weeks of recovery, you can support her by allowing family to visit the baby separately and to visit mom in limited time/quantity with you kicking them out when she's had enough. The extended family sucks by playing victim, but their objection makes more sense than a month of seclusion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now is the worst time for his wife to hear side comments about her appearance, her weight, how she handles her newborn or her house. She\u2019s asking for 3-4 weeks, not 3-4 months!", "Sweet uncle! I wish my brother would make the effort with my son! And yes you get it, I\u2019ll tell my mom anything but I would never discuss with my MIL. I mean my mom would come over and ask if I took my laxatives and how my postpartum bowel movements were lol. I\u2019m not trying to deal with that in front of someone else. And I\u2019d share it with my bro too hahaha", "It's not, your subjective opinion about what is unreasonable isn't important here. What is however important is the person recovering from surgery and their opinion matters more than that of the MIL. In my family there have been people that wanted to have a month to recover not only physically but also mentally. And the last thing any of us would have done is pressure or push that person because we are not selfish enough to force a new mother to decide between her comfort and our wants. Even if it's just for a few minutes. What the mother says goes, because she carried the baby and did all the work and she knows her body and health better than we do, so when she says she needs time we respect that. Even if she doesn't have any other reason than she wants to. Because we are not entitled to meet the child on our terms but on the terms of the parents.", "The 3 months after a baby is born is now referred to as the \u201cfourth trimester\u201d. This is because the mother and baby are very much still operating as one entity, and because the mother\u2019s body is experiencing significant changes. \n\nNobody is entitled to visit someone\u2019s home while they are recovering from surgery.", "Oh we\u2019re in agreement that there should be zero pressuring or forcing anything. Boundaries are so important to establish from the get go.\nI just feel sad for in-laws who are treated as second class grandparents. \nI am biased tho, because am lucky to have wonderful in-laws who have lavished love on their grandkids and seeing that bond develop from birth has been an honour", "It was called the fourth trimester when I first started my family and I practised attachment parenting with every baby. \nGrandparents having a quick cuddle doesn\u2019t need to interfere with the mother-baby bond whatsoever. \nWe\u2019re not talking about entitlement to invade a home.", ">I just feel sad for in-laws who are treated as second class grandparents.\n\nHow do you even come to such a conclusion. For all we know her parents aren't allowed to come either and even if they where, it still wouldn't be the same because things need to be put into context as a whole. She would have people she is not comfortable with in her house while recovering, which is not the same as having people you trust around. And most people tend to trust their own parents that raised them, a lot more, than their in-laws which is completely reasonable.", "feel sad for generally, not specifically to this OP\u2019s case. (Not enough info in his story for me to care about his in-laws.) My comment that you\u2019ve quoted references earlier comments on this post where in-laws, specifically MILs are treated like second class grandparents who matter less because they didn\u2019t raise the baby\u2019s mother.", "They are not treated as less. They are treated like they aren't the new mothers parents, which they aren't. That is not unfair, that literally how the world works, the way you're related to a person matters. I like my boyfriends mother, would I want to see her when I'm struggling and in pain? No, because I'm in a vulnerable position and I do not want people I do not have a certain level of comfort with near me. This is not exclusive to child birth. If my boyfriend had a surgery and needed time to recover the last thing my parents would do is feel as if they are second class because he would rather not see them. Because they have empathy and understand that it's logical that he feels different about his own parents."]}
