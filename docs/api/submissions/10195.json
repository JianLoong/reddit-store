Has the weeks and months went on, I started to ask constantly why I couldn't meet his boyfriend, I started to worry it was some insane age gap between them or something.\n\nYesterday my brother jokingly took my phone and ran off,  so I jokingly took his phone, which he'd left unlocked. I got curious and looked in his pictures, I saw pictures my ex, I was confused why'd he have pics of my ex smiling, then it hit me. I thought my ex was straight so I needed confirmation, I unblocked him on Instagram to see tons of pictures of him and my brother clearly in a relationship.\n\nI confronted my brother about it and he said, \u201cI'm sorry, this why I didn't want to tell you.  I didn't intentionally try to date him, he started hanging out with a friend of mine and it went from there.

It\u2019s not like he\u2019s seeing a man you had a fling with. You were in a TWO year relationship with this person. That\u2019s a major betrayal. \n\nYour family wants you to sweep it under the rug for the sake of peace. But this is the type of behavior that gives you grounds to go full NC with your brother if you wanted. Don\u2019t let other people manipulate you in to thinking that you\u2019re wrong for having an emotional reaction to this.", "INFO: How old is the ex?\n\nMy first read is that he's dating your brother to mess with you. What kind of age is compatible with 32 AND 22?", "100% NTA\n\nNot only did he break your trust and date an ex behind your back, he is bringing toxicity back into your life. That is not someone I\u2019d want spend vacation with, let alone pay to do it. \n\nObviously he knows he\u2019s in the wrong. How did he think this would go? That he\u2019d just hide who he is dating forever? That you\u2019d just get over it eventually? \n\nAlso, the fact that he pointed out he was hot just adds a layer of superficiality. So he\u2019s willing to f up his relationship with you cause your ex is hot??\n\n(Edited wrong word)", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he was doing and doesn't care about your feelings.\n\nThat's why he's such a child he can't own up to it.\n\nHe's the definition of toxic gay, so it's probably makes sense that he's with your toxic ex. Let em be happy together while you enjoy your vacation without him.\n\nAnd if your family is mad at you? They don't have to come either! Go on your own and protect your peace.", "INFO\n\nhave you considered that it may be time to distance yourself from your family entirely?\n\nIt seems they don't have a problem with your brother dating your ex...much less your toxic ex", "Does he know the issues you had with your ex? I'm more worried for your brother then anything else. Don't uninvite him from the trip but explain what happened in your relationship and warn him of the signs he should look out for.", "NTA.\n\nI'd do more than cut him from the trip. I'd cut him from my life. The betrayal is unreal.", "Info: Is the ex coming on the trip too?", "Nta. You don't date your siblings exes or your friends exes. Morally that's wrong.", "INFO:  Since you don't detail what \"toxic\" means, does your brother actually know why you broke up and all of the issues you had with him?  Does the rest of your family?\n\nThere's a 10 year age difference between you and your brother - so was he actually really privvy to all of the details about your relationship and subsequent breakup since he would have been a teenager when you started dating this guy?  How old were you all when you were dating this guy and broke up?\n\nDepending on the answer to the above, I'm thinking the solution lies more in the realm of either more conversations between you and your family are needed or you uninvite yourself instead and treat yourself to a vacation of your choosing and leave them to take and pay for the annual vacation on their own.", "**OOF.**\n\nOk, your brother is wrong for all of that.\n\nBut unless there is precedent, you should continue the tradition, and do not dis-invite him. **BUT** you absolutely should talk about it BEFORE you go on vacation. Tell him your feelings, and let him know if you think you can even hang out with him without getting upset. It might be good to delay the trip, or maybe he will voluntarily not go, if the two of you need more time.\n\nNow, if it turns out that he was more sneaky than it has already appeared, family vacation may need to be cancelled this year so that you can do something for yourself.", "YTA, it's none of your business who he dates, and as long as the ex isn't around you it's not your problem", "NTA 100%. He obviously values his own gratification over loyalty to his family. A simplistic view I know, but inescapable given the circumstances.", "I'm gonna say NTA here, it's pretty bad form to be dating a sibling's ex, especially doing so in secret. He should know this. He probably does know this, if he was hiding it from you.\n\nBefore uninviting him from the trip, though, perhaps consider sitting him down and talking about the situation. If he seems like he understands your issues, and wants to change and grow, maybe bring him along on the trip. But on the other hand, if he doubles down, or anything like that, then there's no sense risking him ruining your vacation, especially on your own dime. And, of course, him bringing your ex along is out of the question, obviously.", "NTA.  He had to know OP was going to find out and potentially be upset so once this became a lasting thing he really needed to step up a say something.  Classic case of actions meeting consequences.", "NTA at all", "ESH. Everyone's families are different,  but as someone who has lifelong good relationship with my siblings,  I'd have a hard time not forgiving my siblings anything (but then,  they are not toxic people. I get not all family relationships are so healthy).  Anyway: is that ex important enough to get between you and your brother? Is your past gripes with that man so abusive you would deny your brother possibly the man of his life?  (A man lying to himself about his sexuality is unlikely to be a good partner to anyone and he may well be a better person  once he's gained self acceptance.)", "ESH. \n\nBad form dating your sister's ex. Your reaction was pretty douchey too.", "[deleted]", "ESH\nSucky to uninvited him.\nAlso sulky to date your sisters ex. This one is probably worse, but two wrongs done make a right.", "I'm sorry, what exactly is his offense here? Are you mad he kept this relationship secret? Considering how badly you reacted to finding out who he was dating, I completely understand why he wanted to hold off on sharing that information with you. Or are you mad because he's dating an ex of yours that you say you are much better off without? It's clearly not as though he's making you spend time around him, or as though you thought you were going to get back together with him. So what exactly is the offense that would warrant disinvitation?", "NTA uninvite the whole family and go on a amazing solo trip. Your brother has zero respect for you. Especially with his comment you know he is hot Ha Ha like making a joke put of it makes it better. \nTell the family they can play for their own family trip with your brother and your ex.", "ESH. Your brother and your ex suck more for dating when he was previously in a serious long-term relationship with you.\n\nBut you don't get a pass from me for invading his privacy and going through his phone without permission.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 why is this so funny to me", "YTA. Your brother is not morally obligated to share the details of his romantic life with you. \n\nMaybe my bias as a gay man is showing here, but it feels like there is a lot of privilege showing from people who have never had to worry about how family is going to react to knowing you're in a same sex relationship with someone. I had several relationships I never felt safe telling my family about. I was together with my current partner a full year before even mentioning it to my family. It took certain members years to warm up to him. So I find it very hard to agree with someone who completely takes it for granted that she has a moral entitlement to personal information about her brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stay away from the ex\u2019s of your brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s!", "NTA - Sit your parents down and ask them... In what world is it okay for a sibling to date a former partner?  Who would want to add that layer of trashy drama to a family dynamic?  If it was a sister instead of a brother would that make a difference?  Do they think there should be an exception for the situation because he was maybe closeted?   What about him being a terrible partner to you says to them that a) you'd want to be around him or b) he wont be terrible to your brother or has other motives dating someone 10 years younger?  If it was all so acceptable--why did brother (and them maybe) hide it for so long?   \n\nYour brother's immaturity SHINES thru with the \"..you know he's hot..\" comment.  Maybe your ex is taking advantage of that to do to your family exactly what is happening now.", "NTA. He had been dating your toxic ex behind your back for 6 months. He knew it was wrong and I\u2019m assuming he knew the relationship was toxic. He is willing to bring this person back in to your life without your consent and could easily end up giving you more problems with your mental health. He might not have brought him on this trip, but in the future he would have. He has betrayed you and clearly cares more about how your ex is hot than what he did to you. You need to go NC and probably go LC or NC with the rest of the family since they are defending him. They are undermining your trauma. No family is worth your mental health.", "You don\u2019t date a siblings ex. Especially without talking to you about it first and seeing if you\u2019d be okay with it (which no one needs to be). Also, unclear on the age gap here but seems like it could be wrong.\n\nSince you\u2019re paying for the trip, NTA, but since you\u2019re entire family is unsupportive, why not uninvite everyone and do something for yourself. Your family can\u2019t seem to see why this is not okay and would make you uncomfortable.", "Gross and incredibly disrespectful. NTA!", "Yeah, what is everyone else on about? You DO NOT date siblings' exes. Gross.", "and it was a TOXIC 2-year relationship that apparently cause quite a bit of mental distress for OP.  She finally gets rid of him, and now he's back - with her brother!!", "I didn't even think of that, you sleuth! I don't think it really impacts the judgement here tho. I imagine the guy is older.", "And he posts pictures on instagram, of course he wants her to find out. \nThey started dating after the ex suddenly started hanging out with a friend of the brother.

He has done nothing so far to re-introduce the ex back into her life.

I think it's extreme to just kick him from the trip over this. Especially when people can change after a bad relationship.

There's too little information on that aspect.", "Yes, your bias is showing.  OP is not the AH, but the brother and ex are.  You\u2019re hung up on the gay part and dismissing the toxic part.", "[deleted]", "He\u2019s bringing the toxicity back into her life by wanting to bring the toxic ex on the family trip.", "I mean, to be fair.. he took her phone first so it\u2019s his own fault she found out.", "Yeah it\u2019s like they also totally glossed over the part where OP says he has introduced many boyfriends to her in the past, but this one was suddenly \u201csecretive\u201d. He clearly only did it because he knew she would be upset and he wanted to wait until the roots were sowed deep so it\u2019d be more difficult for her to make her case", "Why? Because he didn't share details of his sex life with his family? Or because his sister doesn't like the guy that he never brought around or mentioned?", "So... her ex was a toxic horrible a hole to her for 2 years but it was not his fault cuz OMG he was just in the closet and OMG it's so hard in this day and age to be a gay man but it's okay cuz he's totally out now and dating her brother and the two years of crap and torture he put her through can easily be forgotten because he totally didn't mean it cuz he was just gay and using her? Plenty of people throughout history have been gay and in the closet and not been a holes to other people. Plenty of people.

Idk why I mis-remembered that significant others were coming on the trip. Sorry about that.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just a matter of time before the ex starts coming to family events and it will be rationalized as \u201cwell op knows I\u2019m dating her ex and nothing changed so obviously it\u2019s okay to bring him to thanksgiving\u201d and abusers do this kinda thing specifically to torment their exes. He went for the brother intentionally to hurt her.", "That doesn't follow. You're assuming this is a serious relationship with a long future. There's been no particular indication that's the case."]}
