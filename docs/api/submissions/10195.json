So, no don\u2019t let them be happy.", "Why is it her responsibility to put all this effort into maintaining her relationship with her brother when he didn\u2019t care enough to at least talk to her before getting with her ex? I am a strong believer in matching the effort of the other person on any relationship. It\u2019s mentally and emotionally exhausting to care more about a relationship than the other.", "I don\u2019t think OP sucks. \n\nOP was in what she considered a toxic relationship that drained her mental health. So, she got rid of him. \n\nNow, OP finds out that her brother has been in a relationship with her ex for months and he hid this from her and tried to blame her reaction to it as a reason he hid it. That\u2019s betrayal. \n\nShe has every right to disinvite him, because she is hurt and upset. And, why would you want to spend what is supposed to be relaxing and a break away from everything wirh someone who recently hurt you. Especially when you\u2019re paying for it on your dime.", "So he can screw her ex but she can't look in his phone? Redditt is crazy lol.", "Yeah, just let her be okay with her dating not only her ex but someone she described as toxic and mentally draining. \n\nHow about the brother just doesn\u2019t chase after her ex? He clearly hid it, because he knows it\u2019s wrong.", "I don't think it really impacts the judgement here tho. I imagine the guy is older.", "And he posts pictures on instagram, of course he wants her to find out.", "there's a lot of rule #1s lmao", "Yeah what got me too was the brother saying it wasn\u2019t intentional, I really care about him, he\u2019s hot and laughs ? There is zero care for her feelings knowing she\u2019d be hurt. \n\nHe basically told her sorry, not sorry.", "Yup! If brother wants to continue dating this man, that\u2019s their prerogative. OP has every right to have no/low contact with brother from now on though. If other family members have a problem with that, they can keep that opinion to themselves or be cut off as well.", "I would point out that OP didn\u2019t define what \u201ctoxic\u201d meant. It\u2019s entirely possible the relationship was toxic. It\u2019s also equally plausible (and common) in this day and age that \u201ctoxic\u201d is a buzzword being thrown around to paint someone as an abuser without having to provide any corroborating evidence or facts. \n\nNone of that excuses dating the recent ex of a close family member without sitting down and talking like adults. But \u201cOMG HE WAS SO TOXIC\u201d tells us absolutely nothing of substance, and was intentionally vague. So I don\u2019t find OP a reliable narrator either.", "And it sounds like they're pretty close, so OP probably would have told brother at least a little bit about their toxicity. Wtf op's brother?!", "Ex means was previously in a relationship. there's billions of people on the planet, don't date your sisters toxic ex is a simple concept to understand.", "So why did OPs brother hide it instead of talking about it openly?\n\nOh yeah, because he *knew* it would be an issue. Because it's a normal taboo to not try to fuck your siblings exes.", "And? Ex\u2019s are off limits unless discussed otherwise. Especially when it\u2019s a sibling wanting a relationship with an ex partner. The brother owed OP a heads up about the relationship. Brother chose to lie and hide the relationship which to me is an intentional act of betrayal. That\u2019s my opinion. \n\nI know not everyone feels that ex\u2019s are off limits, so they wouldn\u2019t agree that a brother dating his sisters ex boyfriend is a betrayal. That\u2019s their opinion.", "This. I worry for the little brother, think he is being used.", "What? He's not allowed to use social media because op might see it??", "27 smack bang in the middle.", "How long ago did the relationship end?", "Exactly.", "I admit some families are different. My relationship with my siblings is very important to me. Sometimes one of us messes up. We work through it. The one thing I know is I want my siblings happy more than I care about a past relationship that wasn't good for me. Again,  not all families have this dynamic. It's for the OP to decide what's important.", "Yes, and that's not crazy.  Once her and ex broke up she no longer had any control over who he does and does not date.\n\nGoing through someone's phone is always an invasion of privacy and always wrong.\n\nHope that clears it up for you.", "I really care about him, he\u2019s hot and laughs ? There is zero care for her feelings knowing she\u2019d be hurt.", "It may surprise her brother to know there are hot guys in the world his sister didn't have a toxic long term relationship with...", "Dude is fucking his ex's brother its not a far stretch to believe her when she says he's toxic.", "OP never used the word abuser though\u2026 if they felt the relationship was toxic then I\u2019m gonna take their word for it. It\u2019s perfectly possible for a relationship to be toxic but neither partners are abusive. They just don\u2019t go well together and it brought out bad traits. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t anything in this post that makes me feel the OP is an unreliable narrator. It just seems you don\u2019t like certain words being used which is fine. If you feel distrustful of people who use buzzwords, that\u2019s okay as well. But the world isn\u2019t going to stop using words just because you feel they are overused. \n\nI still feel OP is NTA. Even if the relationship wasn\u2019t toxic and it ended with both OP and the ex on good terms, it\u2019s still a betrayal if OPs brother is now secretly dating the ex. Had the brother spoken with OP before hand about the relationship that would change things. The brother doesn\u2019t need OP\u2019s permission to date anyone. However, the brother intentionally hid the relationship which is a dick move. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend a vacation with them either. \n\nIf I were in that position I would just opt not to go on vacation with any of the family and they can pay their own way.", "> that \u201ctoxic\u201d is a buzzword being thrown around to paint someone as an abuser\n\nor that it was mutually toxic", "I would also say that just because it's toxic doesn't mean OP is the victim, or at least the only victim - she could have been just as bad if not worse than him and it would still be a toxic relationship.", "[deleted]", "Disagree. OP YTA", "The OP is responsible for making it an issue", "That\u2019s not the issue here. If the brother and the ex have been dating for 6 months, I assume they have also talked. \n\nThe brother was clearly not ready to tell the family and the Ex posts pictures on what seems to be a public profile. It\u2019s not uncommon for a former partner to go through an ex social media profiles. If the Ex had really cared about his boyfriend, he would have respected that. Because it\u2019s actually possible to have a relationship without having to post about it on social media.", "But in this case, it isn\u2019t a minor mess up. This is a man that she was in a long term relationship with. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unforgivable, but he has to make some effort. I\u2019m very close to my sister and there is much that I wouldn\u2019t forgive her for as long as she puts in the effort to show me that she\u2019s sorry. I\u2019m close with my family but I refuse to be a doormat for anyone.", "She has no case.  She doesn't get to control who dates who and just because she previously dated someone doesn't mean she gets any control on who that person dates in the future.\n\nWTF is wrong with all of you?  Y'all have some really weird control issues.", "To be fair, OP just says the relationship was toxic between OP and their ex, and they are better off without him. Not that he was an asshole that treated her like shit. Different people can have different relationships. Also, gay and straight aren't the only sexual orientations that exist.", "Yeah, but forbidden relationships are sooo much hotter /s", "Maybe her brother is a little toxic too. Given his reaction to her feelings. \n\nAlso I noticed at the bottom it says \u201cI\u2019m uninviting my brother, along with him\u201d so not clear but is he looking to bring the ex/new bf with him now it\u2019s known? And if that\u2019s the case why would the family think that she\u2019s the AH.", "Yeah, exactly, sheesh.", "[removed]", "People can be bi, yo.", "Found the Ex.", "Well, there's also the fact that the ex was toxic to her. If someone was toxic to my sister and treated her badly, they would forever go on my shit list. The brother has no loyalty to his sister against someone who treated her like shit. That's the bigger issue, IMO.", "I didn\u2019t say she should have snooped, but I am saying that if he didn\u2019t take her phone she wouldn\u2019t have taken his.", "There's a period after \"my brother\", so I think \"along with him\" refers to \"along with my brother\" as in her brother and the rest of the family disagrees with her?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
