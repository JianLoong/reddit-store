I had several relationships I never felt safe telling my family about. I was together with my current partner a full year before even mentioning it to my family.

I find that hard to believe that someone who's gay suddenly finds out about it at this age and if that's true he probably started to know about this before he ended his relationship probably a good two years or more if I had to guess.\n\nMy gay friends found out their preference at childhood ages and one at 18 after their first sexual experience. That's why it's called coming out of the closet, not finding out you're in one. He knew it's not even a question in my mind.", "There are a lot of people who come out later in life.
