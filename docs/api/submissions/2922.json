I\u2019ve always been close with my cousin Ray (28M). I had a toxic relationship with one of his good friends when I was in my 20s. Let\u2019s call him Luke.\n\nRay and Luke met in college, they were teammates on the basketball team. Once they graduated, Ray moved back to our hometown, Luke followed and they got an apartment together.\n\nI met Luke through Ray and we started intensely dating.\n\nThen I got pregnant and he started acting strangely toward me, told me he wasn\u2019t ready for kids and it would get in the way of his future (which he thought was an NBA career \ud83d\ude44). I had a miscarriage, which was absolutely devastating and traumatic at the time. He ghosted me shortly after, stopped returning any calls or texts. \n\nI didn\u2019t see or talk to him again for years. That was 2015. In 2018, Rays little sister, got into a car accident. I went back home to be with family. At the hospital Luke apologized to me for how things ended and said he wasnt immature and didn\u2019t appreciate what we had. We started hooking up again, poorest of judgment of my part. Things were good until I realized he had a girlfriend, who was pregnant. He had kicked her out and she was living with her parents, but they were still together.\n\nOnce, I found about her I flipped out. All the unresolved emotions of the miscarriage and the fact that he was having a baby with someone else sent me over the edge. I found her on media and messaged her that we had been hooking up and that same night I slashed his tires.\n\nHe was livid I told her. We had a big blow up resulting in him getting in my face. Told me to delete his number and he never wanted to see me again. It caused a bit a rift between Ray and I, I feel like he didn\u2019t defend me. I get Luke is his best friend but I didn\u2019t think a 6\u20197 dude should be in my face yelling and I expected my cousin to do more.\n\nAnyway life went on. I followed Luke\u2019s instructions and haven\u2019t seen or talked to  him since. He never made it to the NBA, but did manage to have another kid with another woman. I have since gotten married to an amazing man and we have a one year old. \n\nWe spent thanksgiving with my husbands family last year and had planned to spend with mine this year.\n\nRay and his wife recently bought a house and want to host, awesome. Rays wife let me know Luke will be at thanksgiving, not awesome. \n\nThe thought of seeing or talking to this man makes me sick. I cannot think of anything more awkward than sitting at a dinner table with my husband and someone I had such a dramatic past with.\n\nRays wife tried to talk to him about it and he told her I need to \u201cget over it,\u201d I told her to tell him if that\u2019s the case he\u2019s choosing friends over family and I won\u2019t be there. \n\nI\u2019m so upset. It\u2019s not like this man is an orphan, he has a mother, a father, and not to mention 2 children he can spend the day with. Why does he have to spend thanksgiving with my family?", "created_utc": 1669077839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1flma/aita_for_asking_my_cousin_not_to_invite_my_ex_to/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be disrespectful to put your immediate family in the middle of a large extended family gathering where your feelings about Ray may fester and surface. \n\nYour resentment towards your cousin, the host, for not sticking up for you a decade ago or uninviting his good friend and former roommate may also be a source for unpleasantness during what is meant to be a festive occasion. It\u2019s too bad Ray didn\u2019t consider your feelings when he sent out the invites. \n\nSurely, you have (like most 20-year olds) shared the sordid love story with at least a few other people.

If you see cousin at other family events, be completely neutral. Do not talk about the Ex anymore, do not even acknowledge Ex is even alive. \nIt seems in today's society it's ok to cheat on pregnant girlfriends (expose you and pregnant girlfriend to stds)  and ghost women after they have a miscarriage, that's perfectly ok.  Out of all the grimey dirty stuff your EX has done to the female population and more likely continues do to, everyone is hyper focused on the fact that you slit his tires.  \nThis is exactly why being a woman is tight rope walk, and you really have to be careful what you say and do , or you are automatically over emotional and just too much to deal with. \nThe comments on this post should be enough for you OP to open your eyes to how you will be portrayed.

Ray was friends with Luke before you started dating him. His friendship doesn't end just because your relationship did.\n\nYou have a right to be upset and never want to see Luke again. You shouldn't have to. Ray should understand that.\n\nRather than let Luke create more drama and split your family apart, talk to your cousin and explain you respect his decision to have his friend at Thanksgiving, but you will not be attending and you have no intetion or desire to mend fences with Luke.. Tell him you will get together some other time when Luke is not there.\n\nAnd leave it at that. Don't harbor any ill feelings for Ray. It's not his job to defend you or stick up for you or even choose sides in an argument between a couple. I seriously doubt you are as blameless in this as you are making it seem. Every argument has two sides and very seldom is only one of them at fault. \n\nExamine your own motivations for the things you've done and be honest with yourself.\n\nThat said, this Luke guy is definitely an asshole, as he's fucking around on his pregnant girlfriend, regardless of whatever happened between you two.

Maybe his family can\u2019t stand him either", "NTA\n\nYour cousin has shitty taste in friends. Why would he still choose to hang out with someone like Luke? Don't go. Don't apologize for not going.

ESH all around though, besides your cousin, whose worst transgression was introducing you to his friend apparently.", "You lost me when you slashed his tires.\n\nYour cousin didn't defend your batshit crazy because your batshit crazy didn't deserve defending. \n\nRay's house.  Ray's guest list. Go or don't go.

The whole getting people pregnant then washing his hands off the responsibility seems to be a pattern of his. And him getting lhysically violent with yous is judt not okah. So it's completely justified for you to not want to see him.\n\nEqually though, your cousin is allowed to invite who he wants to invite to his house for thanksgiving.\n\nI think the best thing is to just take yourself out of the situation and not go.

IMO, that\u2019s worse than slashing someone\u2019s tires", "Supporting and accepting a friend as family who purposefully cheats and impregnated women then abandons them makes the cousin an AH to me.

There\u2019s no defense to slashing the tires, I was wrong. Ray knows I was wrong. Fairly certain Ray told Luke I was wrong. I was talking about literally defending me. Luke is a big guy.

I think by chosing to be the official thanksgiving host, he is commiting to putting family first. He is doing this for the family, and should think of their interests first.

He got you pregnant and ghosted after you miscarried, then cheated on his pregnant gf with you, but you need to \u201cget over it\u201d because your cousin apparently cares more about having his awful friend at thanksgiving than he does about having you there.

And for me, it would depend on the timing proximity between contacting the GF, the tire slashing incident and the confrontation with Luke.

Don\u2019t think much of your cousin though, even his wife tried to talk to him about Luke.2what kind of cousin would invite family and then someone like Luke to the dinner.
