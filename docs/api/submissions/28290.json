There was some drama with his mom and sister so she moved in with their grandparents. About 2 months of her living there she asked if she could live us. We kept saying no because we didn't want a roommate and didn't have an extra room to give to her. So she just started coming over every single day and sleeping on our couch and eating with us. After about a month of that we decided if she is going to be here anyways might as well charge her rent. We laid down some rule before she moved in and she agreed to them. No drugs(she does shrooms and other psychedelics) had to fix her cat and find home for the kittens she was already pregnant with, and she couldn't keep a kitten either because we already have 2 cats of our own and we didn't want more. She was fine with all this because it was supposed to be temporary. Here we are a year later and all her plans to move out have fallen through so she is no longer leaving and also broke all the rules she agreed too. We only charge her $350 to live here and have been feeding her on our $500 food budget this whole time. Well things have been tough and i cant stretch $500 anymore. We asked her to feed herself her and cats because we have been buying food for them too and she agreed but its been a week and she is still eating our food and her cat dishes have been empty for 2 days now. Their family also thinks we are being mean asking her to buy her own food since she already pays us $350. I tried to explain that $350 is the rent. We don't give our landlord $1800 and then ask him to feed us. My only job is to feed my child and boyfriend. Also a side note when she was looking for different places to live she said her budget was $800 a month so she could still afford her car/phone bills and good. We only charge $350 so by that math she should have more than enough to feed herself especially since her grandparents feed her lunch at work.\nEdit: alot of comments are saying to kick her out. We are renting the house from my bf and his sisters grandparents so we can't kick her out.", "created_utc": 1696526253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170nlxv/aita_for_asking_our_roommate_to_buy_her_own_food/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Go up on her rent, split the rent 3ways and Do a new food budget splitting it 3 ways also. That way everyone in the house is paying an equal amount.", "NTA\n\nCome on it's common decency to buy food if you're living with someone and eating meals with them. She should be buying her own food anyway and I assume if she wants fast food or snacks she does do that but you didn't mention all of what she contributes. She should also be buying her pets food because they are her pets. I think you need to re-evaluate your agreement with this person and make her sign something in writing because I doubt she'll go quietly if you ask her to leave. You need to set boundries and not budge on them going forward.", "Look, it\u2019s all fine to be kind and try to help someone, especially family but she is just taking advantage. Kick her out and give the cats to a good home.", "NTA. Raise the rent.", "NTA but I'm sorry, she is doing all this because you're letting her get away with it. \n\nWe teach people how to treat us.", "NTA. \n\nBUT alternatively, and it may just be easier if she keeps eating your food anyway, up what you charge her in rent and put the difference toward your food budget. So charge her 550 instead of 350, and add the extra 200 to your food budget. And if she doesn\u2019t agree to that or buying her own food, she can find somewhere else to stay.", "How much do you pay the grandparents?", "NTA.  Since you can't kick her out, find someplace else to move and leave her there.  Put locks on your fridge and cabinets or keep the food in your bedroom.  Quit taking care of this mooch!  I know you feel for the cat, so maybe it would be better off taken to a shelter.  She isn't responsible for herself, much less a cat.  I'd talk to the grandparents (owners) and fill them in or how she is abusing you.  And yes, it's a form of abuse.", "If you're renting from their family, why can't they lower your rent so you can feed her? If they're looking into your finances why can't you question why they charge you so much saying you can't afford to pay rent and feed her at the same time.", "Talk about burying the lead. So the property is the Grandparent's, not yours, and they are allowing both their Grandkids to live there after Sister decided she'd rather not live in the same household as them. Why are you even getting the rent from Sister instead of the Grandparents who own the home? Sister has as much right to be there as her brother in this case, the Grandparents are using the place to house their 2 Grandkids, and you are basically just part of the package of Grandson being there and really don't have much standing to demand anyone moves out.\n\nYou could try getting locks for the fridges and cabinets or smaller fridges you keep in your room so that Sister can't get in to the food to eat it, but I think that's just a temporary solution. Long term you and your immediate family are going to need to move out yourself if you aren't happy with how things are going. Presumably you and Hubby have the potential for 2 incomes and will be more able to afford other housing on your own. I'd say just not having your kid around Sister's drugs should be reason enough to leave. Find another place within your budget and don't let Sister in or allow family members to have keys, and she'll no longer be with you eating your food and creating an environment that your kid shouldn't be in. If you can't afford another place because the Grandparents are offering you a much better deal on rent, utilities, etc. then you should count dealing with Sister as part of how you're able to afford to live there overall. This is a take it or leave it situation because despite how entitled you are acting this is the Grandparent's house and not yours.", "This is honestly how I feel because I can't even afford to buy snacks for my child anymore. The $500 budget is running out in 3 weeks even with my son being in school now it still doesn't last I know all of it's not her fault because prices have gone up and I do feel bad that I can't feed her anymore. But for some reason she just doesn't care I guess she said she would buy food I think just to make us happy at that time. And we can't say or do anything without their grandmother getting upset with me and him.", "Don't worry i am feeding them i just take them to my room to do it so she doesn't think im not being serious. I would also like to mention we were spending $90 a month when her cat had kittens and she only bought one bag of food the whole time we had the kittens. One of my cats has to live outside now because he wouldn't stop hurting her cats.", "Exactly. She told her 'no' but the sister started coming around anyway. She dgaf about 'rules'.\n\nOP is NTA but definitely a sucker. Sister is a user. Good luck getting rid of her.", "She is my boyfriend sister, she is 21. He agrees with me and was the one to ask her to buy her own food but for some reason even if we both agree or do something together his family only gets mad at me. I \"brainwash\" him is what they say", "We can't since we are renting the house from his grandparents", "Yes I've recently noticed that all my life I have been getting bullied into submission even my boyfriend does it and I've just started noticing. They're obviously related because they both do it to me! They just keep asking until my no changes to a yes and her moving in is partially to blame on my boyfriend too. He thought since she was here every day anyways we might as well make some money off her to make up for the food she's eating he didn't account for the electric bill to double and didn't think she wasn't going to contribute anything towards the house at all. When our well pump broke she didn't offer to help fix it and just went to a friend's house to shower until we fixed it", "Since we are renting the house from their grandparents we can't ask her to move out.", "I don't want to up her rent because I really think she was lying about being able to afford $800 she was just trying to get her grandma to buy a house for her and her friends to live in. A third of the mortgage would be $600 and i just don't think she could do it, but i do think she can afford to feed herself dinner since her grandma brings her lunch at work.", "She only contributes $350 and that pretty much just pays the electric bill which is usually $380. She did buy a gallon of milk 2 months ago and a bag of cat food 5 months ago. We were paying for her fast food because she said she would pay us back but that never happened. And we usually do pizza once a month and I was getting two to feed everyone and I was only asking for $5 towards the pizza so i was still paying what we paid before but she never gave us that either. She doesn't contribute any money towards toilet paper or paper towels or trash bags which she uses. He won't even replace something if she uses the last of it or tell us that she used the last of it. I just try to make cinnamon toast this morning and the cinnamon was gone I've honestly never run out of cinnamon. This is the second thing of cinnamon I've ever had to buy in my adult life", "Its $1800 a month plus $380 for the electric bill", "Telling the grandparents would do nothing they got mad when I told sister-in-law she had to buy her own gallon of milk. I bought a gallon of milk Friday and then Saturday morning it was Halfway Gone not even kidding half gone. Her excuse was she made a big cup of coffee", "Honestly, our family of 2's food budget is close to $500, so stretching that for 3 adults and a kid is TIGHT. \n\nSince grandma has a favorite and it's not your husband, maybe it's time to put them on mute everywhere for a while and see if SIL can fit it into her 'busy' schedule to find a food pantry, or stop breaking promises and telling lies. Give yourself the breaks you can, and you're NOT responsible for anybody's feelings but your own and your son's (since he's so young).", "Oh my God my mom's been calling me a sucker my whole life she was right!", "Yup. OP has allowed this lady to take over her home.", "So what does your boyfriend do to fix that?  Or is he just ok with letting his family do that to you?", "Ask to lower the rent so you can feed her, if they want to question your finances you can do the same to theirs.", "she never had a plan to move out. \n\nher plan is to stay with you for as long as she wants and to pay you however she wants and to obay the rules she agrees with and tell you ok for the rest without doing. \n\nand that plan will stay in effect as long as her stay with you in nice and cozy. \n\nso you should up her rent to double the market value so she skedaddles.", "Yep, I recognize it because I was like this in my 20s and literally didn't see it until a few years ago with therapy. My partner would do the same. It was like he couldn't understand the word no, and would either throw fits, try to intimidate me or keep asking until I said yes. Give me the silent treatment until I gave in or guilted me.\n\nMy therapist helped me understand how wrong and borderline abusive it was. When I tried to establish and STAND BY my boundaries it was so hard for him because I always caved before. He couldn't comprehend, lol. Then I was told I was \"changing\" and \"being stuck up' and a whole lot of other bs. I was also tough for me to stand my ground.\n\nThe best thing I ever did was stand firm and eventually get away from that toxic mess.", "Your boyfriend bullies you and his sister bullies you, do you really want to be with this person and this family?", "Too bad.  Being over the barrel isn't a happy experience for anyone.  Maybe if you can find ways to make her life miserable, she will move on her own.  If all else fails, the fingernail pliers might help.  (just kidding)", "I don't think me and him are very confrontational people and we don't really know how to give consequences to an adult. We were honestly just hoping she would be okay with buying her own food and she would understand but either she thinks we're doing it to be petty or just doesn't care that we can barely afford to feed ourselves and our child. Me and my boyfriend basically don't eat until dinner. We have been skipping meals so that there's enough food to feed our child. I eat an apple in the morning then just wait for dinner and someone at work usually feeds him lunch", "Well he usually doesn't ask me for ridiculous things, he'll just beg me to buy a game or something or new controller for the Xbox when it breaks. I'm just super frugal and if the right bumper sticks a little bit just live with it man no grenades for you \ud83d\ude02", "I have been kind of doing things not to make her miserable but to be kind of annoying. Like I used to wait until she was awake to start my cleaning but now I start cleaning at 6:00 in the morning radio and all dishes laundry all the noises. I also stopped watering all of her plants for her because honestly there's just too many plants for me to water I have like 5 plants she has 50. It takes an hour \ud83e\udd23", "Silly, just be careful OP."]}
