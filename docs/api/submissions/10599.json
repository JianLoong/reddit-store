This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s uncommon and I wouldn\u2019t say that this woman is my \u201cfriend\u201d but we\u2019re definitely friendly as she\u2019s one of my wife\u2019s closest friends. Her kid is either 7 or 8 I\u2019m not exactly sure, either way I\u2019ve been around her before and she\u2019s mostly pretty quiet but she can be really whiny.\n\nMy dog is 2, he\u2019s a rescue I\u2019m not exactly sure what breed but looks like a mix between a golden and something lol. He was found in a field when he was a puppy and they\u2019re not really sure what happened to him before that but he has a really timid and skittish nature. He\u2019s super sweet but scared of his own shadow, he\u2019s great with people but super cautious and it takes him some time to warm up to them. I have never heard him bark, or growl. Only whimper when there\u2019s loud noises like fireworks.\n\nThe little girl came to our house and immediately was whining because of the dog and that\u2019s understandable because he\u2019s big and she doesn\u2019t have a dog at home. She quickly realized he was sweet and even got friendly with him after some encouragement from her mother and my wife. She started petting him and stuff and eventually she grabbed his ears and she like held them up and perked his ears up and he really didn\u2019t like that, he growled and then cried and came to me so I just told her not to do that anymore and just maybe to leave him be. \n\nLong story short after telling her the same thing like 2 more times my dog freaked out and barked and I guess it scared her and she hit the dog. And I\u2019m watching it happen so I yelled out of pure instinct something like what are you doing or stop doing that I don\u2019t really remember. He whimpered away and came to me and was like genuinely terrified. The little girl started crying and it was this whole big thing. \n\nAfter they left and it was all said and done my wife said she thinks I should issue an apology to her friend and her kid for yelling? She said I overreacted. Obviously I\u2019m going to but I truly don\u2019t think she deserves an apology. I told her multiple times & was mostly looking out for her safety as I had never seen my dog act like that.", "created_utc": 1677029642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118lc9d/aita_for_yelling_at_my_wifes_friends_kid/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And eight years old is plenty old enough to understand that. Regardless of how amazing your dog is or isn't with children they can still bite if they feel uncomfortable. Your reaction may have saved her from at best a nip from the doggo. \n\nI want to know where her mom was during this and why she wasn't telling the child no.\n\n\nNTA, but I'm willing to change my verdict if you don't pay the dog tax.", "NTA\n\nYou already told her to leave the dog alone/in peace. She didn't listen.\n\nHer mother didn't watch her properly.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You don't owe them an apology.", "NTA She was harassing the dog after you told her to stop.  Why wasn't her mom intervening?  She's the only AH for not telling her kid to knock it off.  Then she hits the dog?  Your reaction was appropriate.  It's not like you cursed her out or hit her.", "Absolutely not. You are NTA. The kid was acting badly and her mother should have put a stop to it. You talked to her multiple times and she would not listen. I wouldn't allow her over to the house anymore.", "NTA\n\nGiven your dog's history, you did not know how he would react when the girl hit him. The dog might have ran for the hills, or the dog might have bitten her.\n\nYou had told the girl several times to leave the dog alone. If she wasn't paying attention the first time, her mother should have intervened. You don't owe ANYONE an apology since the girl kept doing something the dog did not like and the mother did not intervene.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA \n\n\nWhy wasn't the parent watching the child? Why didn't they take the time out to correct her behavior?", "NTA\n\nIt's a parent's responsibility to teach a kid how to behave near a dog. If they don't, they shouldn't let the kid near the animal. No matter how gentle or well behaved, a dog WILL react when scared or hurt.\n\nThe woman should be apologizing to YOU.", "NTA", "NTA- you yelled out of concern that the dog may bite out of fear. You should explain to the Mom about what happened and encourage her to teach her daughter how to treat animals as the next dog may not give a warning before biting", "Light.... NTA but you should have removed the dog if you were worried about it nipping/biting, and addressed the issue with the mother. The child is old enough to know better, but if she can't be respectful, she needs to be taught, or removed.", "NTA", "NTA!  The kid was not listening, hit a rescue dog and got yelled at.  I have also have a rescue dog who acts almost exactly like yours and if he'd been treated that way I would have yelled too and not just at the kid.  Mine's known me 10 years and still braces like he's about to be hit when pet him so anybody even raising their voice, let alone a hand, will learn new words.", "NTA. Yelling is fine when there's real danger, and there is not a dog in the world that won't defend itself if pushed far enough. This was a real risk for both her and the dog. Don't let her physically interact with the dog again until she's older. This was incredibly unsafe.", "NTA. Where the hell was her parent in this situation? Nothing against your dog, but that little girl is lucky it didn\u2019t try to bite her. Sounds like the little girl doesn\u2019t get told no, or understand the consequences of actions.", "NTA-Mom should have been keeping an eye on her. You told her to stop. Mom should have made sure she complied.", "NTA, I wouldn't apologize. If the friend wasn't concerned enough to monitor her child, as the adult, you were more than patient with the situation. That kid is not a toddler who won't appreciate her actions. By that age, there are rules that are expected to be followed. Preschool or elementary school would have implemented rules to follow and consequences when they are not followed.", "NTA. You need to set boundaries with your wife\u2019s friend and her child- like *do not hit my rescue dog or you will be yelled at*. Also, why wasn\u2019t your wife backing you up???", "NTA. Spoiled brat can't take no for an answer, then abuses your poor dog. No apology necessary in my book!", "Your pet was mistreated and you need to apologize for stopping it? What the hell is your wife thinking?\n\nNTA. Don't apologize. And set boundaries with this friend and her kid.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at your child after repeatedly asking her to politely stop, ultimately preventing  her from being bitten by my rescue dog who is skittish\u201d", "NTA. Did your wife, at any point, back you up in asking the kid to stop messing with the dog or offer any help in de-escalating after things went sideways? Your wife and her friend behaved really badly: her friend should have gotten her child under control after she continued bothering the dog after being asked nicely not to (and had the reasoning explained to her), and your wife should not have made you be the \u201cbad guy\u201d here. Tbh I think *she* (wife) owes you (and your dog) an apology. If she feels it\u2019s necessary to apologize to her friend then she can also do that, but you did not personally do anything that I feel warrants an apology to the friend or her daughter.", "NTA, The mom should have stepped in after you had to tell the kid to stop multiple times.   Next time they come over, put the dog away.", "NTA\nMy 8-year-old sister knows to be gentle with dogs. She also knows that hitting a dog for not liking what you are doing to them is wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour wife and her friend owe you an apology. They should have been watching her. You did what you had to do to protect your dog. If they did what they had to do to protect that child, no one would have been yelled at.", "NTA. You will be the AH if you let your dog around kids again. It\u2019s giving very clear signals that it can\u2019t handle them and kids get mauled and good dogs get put down every day because of situations that could have been prevented. The kid is a kid and mistakes are gonna happen, but you need to protect your dog right now. I\u2019d apologize for yelling, but explain that going forward there will be new rules.", "NTA her mother should\u2019ve intervened. She was warned more than once, don\u2019t apologize.", "You are NTA. This was a teachable moment for both the child and pup. The child should have listened better after being corrected the first time. She also should never have hit the dog. She cried because your attention went to the dog, not her. You did nothing wrong, but I understand your plans for damage control.", "NTA. No apology necessary. They were guests in your home, you corrected her calmly several times, and Mom *should* have intervened on the first incident and instructed her child on the proper ways to interact with pets.", "I mean it was yelling or her getting bitten. \nI wouldn't apologize at all. And I wouldn't let this kid near my dog.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You need to make it very clear to your wife and whoever else need to hear it that the only apology required here is from them. And until you get it, they are not welcome in your dogs home.", "The kids should no longer be allowed over.\n\n\u201cI apologize, but due to your child\u2019s actions towards my pet and repeated disregard for his warnings, she is no longer welcome in my home. I never should have raised my voice at her, however I was caught off guard when she physically attacked my pet after having already been abusing it.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA the mom should have stepped in and corrected her child. An eight year old is not a toddler. I would have yelled too. That dog us a family member.", "YTA for not removing your dog to a safe space when there was an obnoxious brat tormenting him.", "I\u2019m going to be honest, YTA because you set your dog up to fail. You failed your dog and should have stepped in the first time that kid caused him distress. That\u2019s how kids get bitten and good dogs get put down.", "NTA for snapping. It was an accident and reflex. It's not like it was intentional. However, maybe apologizing for it wouldn't hurt either, since you didn't even mean to yell?", "NTA, the girls mom should have been making sure she was behaving. Still, an apology for yelling would be the bigger person move.", "I'm going to say this gently but YTA, after they second time of the girl hurting your dog you should have probably moved him to another room or outside, and explained to her that she is actually hurting him. At her age most children are starting to learn about empathy and she most likely didn't realize what she was doing. You are VERY lucky he's a good boy and didn't nip or bite her.\n\nA good way to fix it would be to explain that you're sorry you scared her with your yelling, that she hurt your dog and you panicked, and ask her to apologize to your dog. Remember that you are the adult here.\n\nEdit. Also ask her mom why she didn't do anything", "ESH. \n\nYou should apologize for yelling at her daughter (even though what she did was wrong, she\u2019s a young child). It sounds like your yell was inadvertent, anyway. That\u2019s the kind of thing where you scold someone else\u2019s child, without bringing anger into it. \n\nHer mom should apologize to you on behalf of what her daughter did. She\u2019s old enough to respect what adults say and know not to antagonize pets.", "NAH.  You yelled to stop a potentially dangerous situation. That's a safety thing. The \"yelling at\" you describe in your summary is merely raising your voice, unless more was said that you left out?\n\nThe 7-8yo is acting like a 7-8yo. \n\nWorst offenders but still not so bad: The parents were ruffled by someone yelling at their kid which is understandable, but they should have been there watching their child to ensure she is safe and teach her how to act around the dog. Since they didn't do that, then you had to step in.\n\nProbably good to smooth it all out tho.", "YTA- you should have showed the child how to gently pet the dog and explain she is timid and   Most dog certainly don't like their ears pulled- and it growled as a warning.  My chihuahua was a rescue, very timid and I watched her around children.  It's your job to protect the dog - you don't know what kind of abuse it had before - they can't tell you, and you have to be gentle with them to gain their trust.  There is no excuse for hitting your dog!  If she hit the dog, most owners would immediately tell the person - stop and don't do that!   A 8 year old is old enough to know not to hit a animal and the mother and kid owe your dog or at least you an apology. It's a shame the mother doesn't teach her child to be gentle around someone's pet but you need to tell her not to touch your dog - she is too rough with it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her mom should educate her child which she is not ding.", "I don\u2019t know - if a child is about to grab a burner, or pour a boiling pot on themselves, or step out into traffic - you yell if you have to. It\u2019s scary, and there is a reason for that. Hitting any animal could cause a reaction and you should not do it. Plus at 7-8 years old, this isn\u2019t a toddler. He didn\u2019t yell at her afterward, he yelled to get her attention (and probably the dog got startled too and was able to not react).
