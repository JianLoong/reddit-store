He is the one that actually knows what happens in his family. If he made the decision to donate it, he was within his rights.

In a sad way", "Everyone keeps saying it's his money. That's a fact, not an argument or a discovery. \nHe is here asking if what he did is right or not because he's not sure. \nI think he might have reacted strongly to his family entitlement.", "It still was better to give it away than to give it to them. I would've flushed it down a toilet before letting those entitled AHs lay a hand on my money (of course his solution was better because he got to help someone in desperate need). You think he should've given them the money despite them being entitled, because they're faaamily?? He asks because there are people like you who guilt trip him. He is not the one who is an AH in this story."]}
