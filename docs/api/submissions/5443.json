She insisted +1's were only for \"serious\" relationships, which she defined as over 1 year together or married... but there are two huge problems with that. First that she's judging others relationships by *her* standards (which, let's be honest, is rude as all f\u00d7ck! Time investment is **not** a good indicator of seriousness / commitment). And second that she was depriving all sorts of people of having someone to dance and hang out with by essentially forcing all sorts of guests to be there solo.\n\nWhen some people grumbled, she let it \"slip\" to one gossipy person how much the per plate cost was, and to a different gossipy person how much the dress was... All that did was create more upset really, because the reality is most guests weren't going to be spending the entire event at her side, nor appreciate having to socialize awkwardly with her other suddenly-solo but not mutual friends or having to dance alone or only during group dances...\n\nYes, it was *her* day, to run however she wanted, etc. etc. etc., but there were a lot of people who didn't go because of that. For me personally, it was an easy \"regretfully decline\" when she told me privately she was \"cool with\" giving me a +1 (because I asked her about it long before she sent the invites as my relationship was a bit atypical but serious so my partner and I could start coordinating) and then the invitation arrived without it... Because why was I going to travel a few states over, spend on a hotel and transportation, buy wedding appropriate clothing, a gift, etc., when she had decided my relationship wasn't \"real\" because it didn't perfectly fit her rules / view?\n\nSo, OP, while you made a point of referring to her as your stepsister, unless she's great friends with half the people there and/or you expect her to be way too busy helping you AAAAAAAAAAAAAALL night long, if she's been dating someone long enough that you've personally met her partner more than once...
