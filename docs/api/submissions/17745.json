We live very close to disney and a lot of my family and my wife\u2019s family comes from other places and stays with us for vacations and to see us, which i really enjoy having them over, thats far from the issue. \n\nIn a week, my father in law is coming to live with us to try to find a job, and is going to be staying in my extra room, which i have set up as a gaming room/movie room to enjoy with my wife. \n\nThis is not the issue, the issue is that, without discussing it with me, without asking me, and without telling me anything about it, my sister in law planned all of it. My sister in law is my neighbor but since they don\u2019t have a extra room in their apartment (because the other room is a nursery) she offered mine. My wife found out about it a few days later but i found out like weeks after it was all planned.\n\nWas i going to say no? Never. I love my father in law to death and i would do anything to help him, but NO ONE discussed this with me, no one asked me anything and i feel like i was not respected as the head of the household. \n\nI told my wife about how i felt and one thing lead to the other and we ended up having a big fight about it.

The first time it was sprung on me very suddenly (I hadn\u2019t even met him, my partner hadn\u2019t spoken to him in a decade, we were absolutely a last resort) it went disastrously until he finally moved out over a year later to go live with his girlfriend in another province.\n\nWhen he called us again I did give him a second chance but with stipulations. He was not to drink while living here at all (he\u2019s an alcoholic), he could either go work with my husband or had four weeks to find a job and while he was doing so we were allowed to check in with his progress, once he found a job he had to pay (very nominal) rent of $200/month (to help with increased utilities) and would be responsible for his own groceries and cooking his own meals, and he had 6 months to find a place for himself to live if he planned to stay. \n\nOnce rules were in place it was like living with a completely different person. He was pleasant and opted to go work with my husband (same company, different crew) because it was very good pay. Ironically the apartment he moved into was next door to who is now his long term partner (who I adore and think is great for him). We now have a great relationship with him and my kids adore him.
