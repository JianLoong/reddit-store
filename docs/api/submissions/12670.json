He has been like this for years, following being babied severely after his cancer diagnosis when he was 5. He has been in remission for years but he still uses it to his advantage. It's literally the excuse for everything at this point, including him refusing to pick up after himself. \n\nI was asked to travel hours out of state to go and grab my brother from his father's house after some stuff happened that prevented him from taking his flight home. I had no problem doing this. We stopped at an air bnb for the night on the way home. This house was freezing upon arriving. The heat wasn't on at all. I went and turned the heat on and within 5 minutes he shut the heat off and said he was \"stifling hot\" and threw a tantrum when I told him I was freezing my ass off. So, being exhausted and pissed anyways from driving so much, I just made a backhanded comment of \"sure, I will just freeze my ass off because of your entitled fucking bullshit\". I then went and took every single blanket out of the pantry and moved them to my bed (he was getting the couch). There were 3 blankets collectively. I then went to sleep.\n\nHe woke me up at one point and asked for a blanket and I said no. I'm not going to freeze because he won't let me turn the heat on without him losing his shit like a child and since he likes the cold, he should have no problem sleeping without a blanket. The air bnb wasn't even 62\u00b0. He called mum and whined about it and my mom says I'm an AH because \"ever since he got cancer his body temp runs higher and it's not fair that you can't understand and accommodate.\" This was following me having to clean up garbage and dirty clothes throughout the whole air bnb because he was up all night watching TV and couldn't clean up after himself because \"I don't have to do that, my legs hurt.\" AITA? No, I didn't ever give him the blanket. I told him to turn the heat on and he wouldn't.\n\nETA: I paid for the entire trip. All of this was on my expense. He didn't offer to help pay, though he had money. My mom didn't offer to help either. So I paid over $600 to do this for him. He's been out of chemo for 7 years, been in remission since his first round of chemo at age 5. His cancer needs to stop being used as an excuse. He no longer has cancer. I did get up and try turning the heat on twice. He got in my face and pushed me out of the way while screaming \"I said no, f*ggot\".", "created_utc": 1679232672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vli54/aita_for_forcing_my_brother_to_sleep_without_a/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he's big enough and angry enough to scream slurs in your face, how are you supposed to deal with that?\n\nI would categorically refuse to bring him anywhere ever again.  That behavior is wildly unacceptable and your mom enables and supports it.

You shouldn't have to endure abuse from a 14-year-old. It doesn't sound like he actually needed a blanket, he probably just didn't like that you had all three.

I don\u2019t think you were wrong in your actions to your brother.  You gave him options and he made a choice not to turn the heat on. That\u2019s his problem. Since you paid for the accommodations, you get control of the thermostat. If it were me, I would have given him the blankets and made him sleep in the car if he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off the heat. \n\nAlso, your mom is responsible for taking care of your brother. If he missed a flight, your mom should have been responsible for booking him a hotel room by the airport or finding another way to get him home. If he is old enough to fly by himself, then he can take care of himself in a hotel room for a night. \n\nIn the future, I wouldn\u2019t put yourself in the middle anymore.
