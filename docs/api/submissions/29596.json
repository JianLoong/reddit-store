Plenty of people find it tacky and gifts grabbing to have another baby shower after the first especially if children are close together and same gender. If you don\u2019t want to host maybe explain that unfortunately you thought you had the time to host but ends up you dont. Apologize and hopefully she accepts that.\n\nShe wants a baby sprinkle for she wants her pregnancy to be celebrated. I definitely think there are other ways for her to do that. Like a maternity shoot or a pregnancy spa day. Some people love to make casting of their pregnant belly. She needs to realize she could be an ah if she wants a sprinkle for gifts.", "NTA. This may be colored by the fact that I am someone who is VERY MUCH over being expected to attend every shower, sprinkle, gender reveal and whatever else kind of self indulgent party people getting married and having children want to have thrown for them, but I am fully with you. Two showers in two years in order to get unnecessary gifts is too much.", "NTA\n\nIf it's not a gift grab she will agree to a ladies brunch.  It can be a celebration of her pregnancy  and she can be the focus just no expectation of gifts.  If the only way she feels special is to get a lot of stuff then that's on her.", "NTA, and what the hell is a \"baby sprinkle\"? \n\nI'm generally against events where people receive unnecessary gifts and forces others to spend money for no reason (like bridal showers). a baby shower actually has a purpose where the parents receive necessities like diapers and a crib. but if she already has stuff leftover from the first baby then expecting people to buy you even more is not really okay.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t required to host anything for anyone. Tbh the pregnancy being unplanned isn\u2019t your issue and it isn\u2019t her social circle\u2019s responsibility to shower her with gifts because of it. \n\nI always found baby showers for second+ children weird outside of there being a large age gap or something. Even for the opposite gender is odd to me. \n\nIf she\u2019s feeling down and stressed because of the pregnancy (which is totally fair) a nice girls brunch or day out would be a great offer. If she\u2019s not happy with that she can plan her own sprinkle.", "INFO:\n\nHave you spoken to her about what she wants this baby sprinkle to be? Maybe she just wants a little celebration for her and the baby and isn\u2019t expecting anything gift-wise? In which case you could specify on invites that gifts aren\u2019t expected. Equally, maybe people could bring small token presents or things she specifically needs, if she\u2019s running low on certain items of clothes because baby number one had accidents, maybe she could just use some nappies for when baby arrives, little inexpensive gifts from close friends/family to celebrate.\n\nBaby showers also don\u2019t have to be all for the new baby. Maybe it would be nice for people to buy gifts for her? If she\u2019s had a tough time this pregnancy, maybe she\u2019d really appreciate some little token bits for herself, some nice slippers or bath sets. You could even just organise a dinner with a few close friends/family to celebrate the new baby and everyone could pitch in to cover her meal. \n\nI think it depends what her expectations are here. If she\u2019s expecting big, lavish gifts like the first time around I can completely understand your issue with hosting, but if she genuinely just wants to have a fun day with her loved ones and actually get to be excited about her new baby during a pregnancy that has seemingly been quite difficult for her, then I don\u2019t see why there\u2019s an issue.", "NTA. Sprinkles aren't usually thrown so close to the first shower, it's usually when pregnancies are further apart and/or unexpected so the parents have likely gotten rid of the essentials. Maybe you could suggest a nesting party? A group of friends/family get together at her house and deep clean everything, get the nursery ready, make or bring freezer meals, take a break for food and socializing, and finish up with whatever she needs done. I'm pregnant with my third and if we lived near family I would love to have this instead of any kind of sprinkle or shower.", "NAH\n\nBut a baby \u201csprinkle\u201d is meant to be much smaller than a full baby shower with smaller and more practical gifts.\n\nMaybe combine it with a girl\u2019s night out and do it in a restaurant where everyone gives her diapers, pacifiers, and whatnot if you don\u2019t feel like hosting. And split the cost of her meal.", "NTA. \"Sprinkles\" are nothing but a tacky gift grab. No one should feel obligated to subsidize multiple kids.", "YWNBTA. She needs a diaper registry and a spa day.", "I know that in general, one baby shower is sort of the rule, but this is an unplanned pregnancy, probably a young mother who will now have two kids under two. With the exorbitant cost of essentials, perhaps a little get together to restock diapers and baby wipes wouldn\u2019t be such a bad Idea. Anybody who feels otherwise isn\u2019t obligated to attend. I\u2019m going to say. NAH because you really didn\u2019t say she was doing anything to indicate she was being overly greedy and just looking for gifts. And I\u2019m just giving you the benefit of the doubt..", "NAH\n\nI have 3 kids, all boys. They are 2 and 3 years apart. I had friends who threw a baby shower for each of them, but I never expected gifts from the people attending. I am of the mindset that each pregnancy and each child deserves to be recognized and celebrated, regardless of whether \"stuff\" is needed for their care. There are lots of ways to accomplish this while still holding to a more traditional shower or sprinkle - diapers and wipes, freezer meals, everyone decorate a quilt square, etc. OR just a gathering of loving, supportive friends and family.\n\nAll that being said, if you don't want to host such a gathering, it's 100% ok to decline. There's got to be *someone* else who could do it if she feels strongly about it.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIt really is not very appropriate since she still has new clothes from the last shower she had.

Basically just a girl\u2019s brunch where mothers of multiples share funny/crazy stories of survival, everyone submit advice (maybe even a game of judging good and terrible advice?), and sweet sibling stories? Lots of blue, but emphasize no gifts so no one is offended?", "[deleted]", "I think the idea that a person should only get a baby shower for 1 baby is becoming outdated. A lot of people now believe that it\u2019s ok to want to celebrate each pregnancy. I think you should adjust your thinking about this and host her party. Or merge your idea of a brunch to still be centered around her. If people don\u2019t like that a persons having another celebration for an entirely different baby then they don\u2019t have to go. People can turn down invitations, I don\u2019t know why people seem to forget that. But also maybe make sure it\u2019s not centered around the idea of gift giving, it\u2019s just a party to celebrate your friend and her pregnancy. Put something on the invitation like \u201cgifts are not necessary, but if you want to get a little something then here\u2019s the persons registry and diapers are always welcome.\u201d Even if a person feels obligated to get a gift, they can still pick something small and cheap. If you care about this person and think she\u2019s deserving of your time and a little get together to celebrate her then forget about old school ideas of baby showers and throw her a party.", "MYA but what da heck is baby sprinkler? How much more baby made up days are crazy parents plannin to create!?", "NTA. Those in favor of going against the tradition and long standing etiquette of only having a shower for your first kid, unless your children are far apart in age, always use the line \u201cevery baby deserves to be celebrated\u201d. News flash there are ways to celebrate a child/pregnancy that are not an outright gift grab.\n\nMost people you are close to will bring you a gift when they meet your baby for the first time any way.  No need to have a party before the baby is born. If it was about truly celebrating every child, a small get together to meet the child in question after their birth fits that desire. We also celebrate the birth of every child every year on their birthday. \n\nI also frequently here people argue in favor for a baby shower/sprinkle for every baby by saying that parents still need items for each child. Since when is it the responsibility/obligation for others to facilitate your decision to have a child? If you can\u2019t afford a second child, don\u2019t have one till you can. \n\nI do however think it is a good idea to show love and support for expecting mothers you are close to. A day out of pampering for mom with the cost split between those who are close to her, or a girls lunch is a great idea. It should be up to those in attendance if the want to bring a gift for mom or baby, not an obligation like a shower or sprinkle implies.  \n\nThe purpose of a shower is to help prepare a first time parents/parents for parenthood. To help offset the extreme cost of having to buy at once the dozens of items new parents have to have out of the gate, and gift items experience parents know can be lifesaver that a newbie presents wouldn\u2019t even think about. It also to show parents they have a village of support and provide advice for first time parents. That should not be needed with a second child, yes celebrate the birth of every child, but asking someone to throw you a party for which the primary purpose is not celebrating the child, but instead giving you a gift of your choosing via a registry, is tacky, you can\u2019t convince me otherwise.", "Baby sprinkle?  Is that slang for christening?", "Anyone organizing\u2014in any way, no matter how indirectly\u2014their own celebration is just tacky. Or if it\u2019s immediate family.

You were willing to help her if it was a girl because then she would need all new everything for a baby girl. Since she is having a boy, another boy, she should have just about everything she needs except for diapers and maybe formula. If she wants to have a sprinkle shower, let it be on her and her family to host it. Call me old fashioned, but these babies sprinkle showers have gotten totally out of hand. Unless there is a six or seven year age gap between the children, it is up to the parents to supply everything they need. Tell her you would have done it if it was a girl, but since she's having another boy, she should have just about everything she needs and therefore you will not be accommodating her with any type of a shower.

And that\u2019s why I said I want to offer to host something else?", "You could even frame it as, you have so much stuff for the baby already, why don't we do something for you instead. Then suggest the spa, maternity shoot, girl's brunch etc.", "Maybe a diaper brunch or something? \n\nLess general gifts and more specific consumables that babies go through?", "I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s the cost of hosting or the focusing of attention on her or her getting more gifts that you\u2019re uncomfortable with. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re obliged to host anything and you should certainly not if you\u2019re not comfortable. But I would say that gifts of diapers are always appropriate no matter the spacing of babies. You don\u2019t have to do more than that if you do attend a sprinkle for her that someone else hosts. And her family and friends are welcome to give whatever they want - it\u2019s not your job to worry about their gifts.", "Even if you just did a brunch and asked friends to bring diapers and maybe their favorite book from childhood, that would be more than enough and such a sweet gesture!\n\nDiapers can be expensive and you can never have too many (until youe baby goes up  size during 3 specific minutes over night.)\n\nOr or or have a friend bring a pack of size 1 and a book that coordinates with that approximate age range, another friend do size 2 and a book that coordinates with that age range, and so on and so forth. That way she can  still get something meaningful but small, plus diapers.", "Can you tell me the difference between a sprinkle and a shower? I've honestly never heard the term baby sprinkle. Judging by your comment and others, my only guess is that it's just a smaller baby shower. Is that what you call the second party if you have two kids close together? Are you only supposed to have one actual shower even if you have more than one kid? I really don't get it.", "If I were invited to a sprinkle I would buy gentle wipes. Maybe a small gender specific toy tied in the bow of the ribbon. Sprinkles are to replenish disposable supplies. Wipes are useful for many different things.", "And, to her friend\u2019s credit, she ended up seeing her point and actually sent her the shoes that were the only item on the registry with a nice note. That was a good episode!", "I now wish I had watched all of SATC just to see this episode.", "Oh gosh. In my family my racist a hole of a brother is constantly celebrated cuz marriage and babies.\n\nApparently my life is not worth celebrating cuz I've done neither of those things?", "See, this I'd be fine with! My cousin had a 'sprinkle' for her 2nd (2 years after her first) and registered for EVERYTHING. Crib, stroller, whole 9 yards", "Where I am from there isn't anything wrong with having multiple sprinkles, it's more that it's a celebration of the baby that is coming and for the mum to be to put her feet up and be celebrated for the day. You can bring gifts if you want to, but it's not compulsory. In my extended family we often note on the invitations (for all sorts of events) that gifts aren't necessary, it's just about getting together to celebrate. I think it depends on the kind of people you associate with though I guess. I've definitely encountered those who treat these sorts of events as a gift grab.", "It\u2019s still possible to buy gender neutral items, can be harder with clothes past a certain age at times but it\u2019s still out there. All of the big stuff: strollers, car seats, high chairs, playpens, bouncers etc are easily available in gender neutral stuff. People that don\u2019t know the gender of the baby are able to fill a nursery with gender neutral stuff (I\u2019ve basically done that myself). \n\nWanting gender specific stuff is a WANT. Wants don\u2019t need to be funded by your community.", "So basically she admitted that it wasn\u2019t about celebrating the new baby or wanting to celebrate her pregnancy, but was in fact an actual gift grab. \n\nWhich in my experience a second shower is 90% of the time, even when I hear that classic line of \u201cEvery child should be celebrated\u201d from the gift grabbers mouth. Those close to you do In fact celebrate the birth of every child you have, they do it every year, on that child\u2019s birthday. \n\nNow, I also think that when you are close to someone who is pregnant, you should do something special for them during pregnancy. A pampering session for the MTB with the cost split by her friends.  Chipping in to hire a housecleaning company to come by once a week during those last few months of pregnancy. Chipping in for a meal service for the first few weeks after coming home. Stuff like that make sense, and people don\u2019t find them tacky or off putting as having multiple showers/sprinkles for which the purpose of the party is gifts, not celebrating a baby or lavishing love on a mother to be.", "So if people do think she's being greedy, the blame will fall on you for throwing it and inviting people, and might feel more socially pressured into going because they'll look like bad friends in comparison to you. \n\nShe's not soft, your friend, is she?", "In the invite include a list of items she will need for the new baby.  Diapers, wipes, lotion, and a donation with a link to a spa day.  If they bring other gifts it\u2019s on them, but to expect more is rude on the new mom.", "I honestly had to look it up; I thought it was some kind of non-/anti-religious term for a baptism.\n\nAnd, yes\u2026 dreadful.", "I\u2019m sorry if this comes off offensive but that all sounds exhausting, people talking about someone not going somewhere for years to come. And the whole baby shower/sprinkle thing too, but that could just be me tbh, they\u2019re not much of thing in my circles and have only started being a thing recently where I am.", "Personally I think that thinking a baby shower is only to get gifts is a very outdated way of thinking. Baby showers can be just a party to celebrate a new baby and the person bringing that new baby into the world.", "But the main reason of a baby shower isn\u2019t to get gifts, it\u2019s to celebrate a new baby and the person who is about to birth that baby.", "Lol ok.", "In the U.S., we only have baby showers for 1st time parents.", "Why are you and OP assuming this is about getting stuff?", "I see,  well I would just talk to her about your brunch idea. Maybe everyone could bring diapers and a gift and its kinda like a mini sprinkle", "I\u2019m mostly uncomfortable thinking about being the one to send the invites to people, a lot I know will have something to say about it behind our backs or will feel pressured to accept. \n\nI don\u2019t mind taking the money hosting would cost and doing something else like having brunch with a few friends and going to a spa day before giving her maternity photo shoot. If people brought gifts it wouldn\u2019t bother me or anything. It\u2019s more I don\u2019t want to imply I\u2019m expecting people to bring them which I feel like \u201csprinkle\u201d does.", "Baby sprinkle normally happens a few years after the first child or it is a different gender than the first.  It's a new thing that started popping up a few years ago.. honestly it just feels like a money grab and I stand by my statement in my original comment even tho it's unpopular.  You have one kid and want another but you don't plan for it?? Like wtf.", "Sprinkle is when you have kids close together. You still have big ticket items. Plus most of the stuff from your first. It\u2019s mostly for people who second baby a different gender or some just instruct if you bring a gift to do diapers, wipes, lotion or any no reusable item. \n\nLets say someone has kids ten years apart. Then it would be a baby shower for both if they have them.", "In my family it\u2019s just a ladies\u2019 get-together to celebrate the coming baby. We usually go out to lunch, or maybe someone hosts at their home. No wrapped gifts. Anyone who wants to gives a little money to the host ahead of time and she uses it to buy a gift card to Target or Amazon to help towards whatever she may need for the baby. It\u2019s mostly about the time together and the conversation and food", "In this scenario, I'd buy them condoms.", "I do diapers. I asked if there a certain size they want.", "I read a post here years ago, a woman said she doesn\u2019t want to get married or have kids and she was frankly tired of giving for everyone else\u2019s milestones while she basically got ignored. She loved her life and her profession but never got celebrated. It was right around a big birthday (30 maybe) and the comments suggested buying the big fancy dress, have it catered in a venue and basically throw yourself the best birthday party ever. I don\u2019t think most people don\u2019t want to celebrate their friends, I think we\u2019re all just trained to only celebrate certain things, until told otherwise.", "Well they can\u2019t celebrate you for those things. You still have a birthday, maybe you\u2019ve graduated from some place? Otherwise, what would you like them to celebrate?", "Did she gifted or sell her stuff? Then i could see but thats on her. I held on to mine for wasn\u2019t positive when on age gap we were shooting for. I did give car seat away to my sister though.", "I don\u2019t disagree. I think I was just more willing to be the scapegoat when I had the precedent of it being because the baby is a girl but I don\u2019t want to get dragged in now that\u2019s off the table.", "I mean it should be, but showers are very often gift grabs. The whole name comes from \u201cshowering\u201d someone with gifts.", "A baby shower has always been a way to get the things new parents need that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford any other way.  People would chip in for the big ticket items and give smaller gifts like onesies.  Celebrating the baby has nothing to do with the shower because the baby isn\u2019t even here yet it\u2019s all about the parents.  If you want to celebrate the baby then have a gathering after the baby is born and bring food to the new parents they will need it.", "I\u2019m also in the US", "Because that is the purpose of a \u201cbaby sprinkle\u201d. \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask for a celebration lunch for her pregnancy. She didn\u2019t ask for a gathering to congratulate her pregnancy. She asked for an event that comes with gifts.", "I think a sprinkle implies the purpose is gifts for most people we know. I\u2019m not sure what else to call it if it isn\u2019t centered on gift giving? That\u2019s also the reason she gave when asking if I would throw her one instead of her family this time when we thought it might be a girl. I just don\u2019t think me being the host will prevent people from talking as much when it is another boy now.", "I agree that it seems trashy and like a money grab. The term baby sprinkle is also fucking ridiculous. I get it now, but I first thought that OP was just mistranslating the word shower until I read through the comments.", "I have done that. Condoms, earplugs, carpet stain remover.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Not newborn! Lol so many chunky babies don\u2019t fit. Granted both mine fit for 3 months each but we still had way more newborn diapers than needed.", "My birthday, which was also me returning home after a 12 month international tour as company manager was at my brother's favourite restaurant, which I hated?\n\nHow about me? My achievements? What I value even though it's not forcing babies out of my vag?", "Gifts is just one part of a baby shower and absolutely doesn\u2019t need to be the main part. And yes you can celebrate that the person is having a baby and celebrate that a new baby is coming before they are born.", "No, and OP is definitely NTA in this situation. Especially considering the kid is going to be the same gender and with less than 2 years apart. At most, their friend might need smaller clothes if they didn't keep anything from the first and maybe a car seat.", "My kid had irritations to a couple kinds of diapers, so I\u2019m more hesitant about that now. I did donate to a diaper fund on Amazon for a coworker, though.", "Agreed!", "Do they know you hate the restaurant?", "That\u2019s honestly so much better because then the parent can chose the size and type AND doesn\u2019t have the possibility of a size two or higher waiting around the house a year to be worn.", "Yup."]}
