I mean, like a friend.", "https://www.facebook.com/Sheila.Gregoire.Books?mibextid=LQQJ4d\nWritten by Sheila Gregoire. Facebook link above \n\n\u201cHow do I talk to a woman about what she's wearing?\"\n\nI've received a number of social media messages from women lately asking how to approach a woman about her clothing choices. In some cases it's been a work situation. In others a ministry situation.\n\nIn several cases, the women asking the question have been appointed by others to be the one to deliver the message.\n\nThey don't want to cause shame, but what do they say?\n\nMy response:\n\n1. If you are going to approach a woman about her clothing, it must be because she violated a clothing code that is universally applied. So if she wore shorts to a function and men were upset about how long her legs were, but these men were also wearing shorts, you don't get to say a thing. The problem is not her clothes; it is the men's thoughts.\n\n2. To go along with that, the problem has to be the appropriateness of her clothing, not how her body looks in the clothing. In several cases, I've been told, \"she's really well-endowed, and that's distracting to the men around her.\" She cannot do anything about being well-endowed. Unless she is wearing something that is totally inappropriate, then if you were to mention anything to her, it would be based on her body, not her clothes. DO NOT SHAME A WOMAN FOR HER BODY.\n\n3. Ask yourself, \"is this really a moral issue? Is this really that important?\" If men are being made uncomfortable, why is it necessary to transfer that discomfort and shame onto a woman? Why not ask the men to deal with their discomfort?\n\nIf you are in a work situation and are being asked to deliver the message, UNLESS the woman is flagrantly violating a dress code that is universally applied and well known, I would refuse. Stand up for her. It is not your responsibility to be a man's message bearer. And do you really want to work in a place that treats a woman like this? \n\nAn attractive woman should not be considered a problem. A woman's body should not be considered a problem. Appropriateness in dress matters, absolutely. But then it's about a dress code, not her body, and not men's thoughts. Let's get this right.\n\nUPDATE: People are talking about the concept of \"appropriate\" int he comments. I'm thinking of work situations, where, for instance, some workplaces may not want jeans, or t-shirts, or shorts, or spaghetti straps, or casual clothing, or open toed shoes, or sneakers (except for Casual Fridays or something). Or the may want \"business/professional attire\" rather than 'after work/party attire.\" That's the kind of \"appropriate\" I'm talking about. I think those are valid for businesses to enforce--IF they are universally enforced; they are clearly defined; and they are gender neutral.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Sheila.Gregoire.Books?mibextid=LQQJ4d", "YTA and misogynist", "YWBTA.
