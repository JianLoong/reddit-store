I mean, like a friend.", "https://www.facebook.com/Sheila.Gregoire.Books?mibextid=LQQJ4d\nWritten by Sheila Gregoire. Facebook link above \n\n\u201cHow do I talk to a woman about what she's wearing?\"\n\nI've received a number of social media messages from women lately asking how to approach a woman about her clothing choices. In some cases it's been a work situation. In others a ministry situation.\n\nIn several cases, the women asking the question have been appointed by others to be the one to deliver the message.\n\nThey don't want to cause shame, but what do they say?\n\nMy response:\n\n1. If you are going to approach a woman about her clothing, it must be because she violated a clothing code that is universally applied. So if she wore shorts to a function and men were upset about how long her legs were, but these men were also wearing shorts, you don't get to say a thing. The problem is not her clothes; it is the men's thoughts.\n\n2. To go along with that, the problem has to be the appropriateness of her clothing, not how her body looks in the clothing. In several cases, I've been told, \"she's really well-endowed, and that's distracting to the men around her.\" She cannot do anything about being well-endowed. Unless she is wearing something that is totally inappropriate, then if you were to mention anything to her, it would be based on her body, not her clothes. DO NOT SHAME A WOMAN FOR HER BODY.\n\n3. Ask yourself, \"is this really a moral issue? Is this really that important?\" If men are being made uncomfortable, why is it necessary to transfer that discomfort and shame onto a woman? Why not ask the men to deal with their discomfort?\n\nIf you are in a work situation and are being asked to deliver the message, UNLESS the woman is flagrantly violating a dress code that is universally applied and well known, I would refuse. Stand up for her. It is not your responsibility to be a man's message bearer. And do you really want to work in a place that treats a woman like this? \n\nAn attractive woman should not be considered a problem. A woman's body should not be considered a problem. Appropriateness in dress matters, absolutely. But then it's about a dress code, not her body, and not men's thoughts. Let's get this right.\n\nUPDATE: People are talking about the concept of \"appropriate\" int he comments. I'm thinking of work situations, where, for instance, some workplaces may not want jeans, or t-shirts, or shorts, or spaghetti straps, or casual clothing, or open toed shoes, or sneakers (except for Casual Fridays or something). Or the may want \"business/professional attire\" rather than 'after work/party attire.\" That's the kind of \"appropriate\" I'm talking about. I think those are valid for businesses to enforce--IF they are universally enforced; they are clearly defined; and they are gender neutral.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Sheila.Gregoire.Books?mibextid=LQQJ4d", "YTA and misogynist", "YWBTA.

Men\u2019s nipples are often noticeable through clothing, but it\u2019s not taboo, so isn\u2019t seen as unprofessional.", "So a patient came in and was not wearing a bra but was otherwise covered?  Leave them alone. There could be any number of reasons for the choice not to wear the bra from a rash in the area to just not feeling comfortable in one. Unless their breasts were falling out the bottom or a sleeve, let the person dress how they wish.", "YWBTA. People do not need to wear bras and it would be wildly inappropriate to tell a patient they need to wear a bra so your coworker isn't uncomfortable with something that has zero effect on him. Like.... are y'all gonna deny her healthcare if she doesn't put one on? To what end?", "Think about it this way ...... excessively reveling clothes is suppouse to mean to low cut or too short. Bit what about a black shirt soo tight its a second skin or wearing a neon bra under a white t shirt.  \n\nDoes policy regulate if your underwear shows what to d", "YWBTA - but where on earth does a healthcare facility have a dress code for patients in the first place?\n\nWeird", "YWBTA This is a silly and intrusive request particularly in a medical setting. If a medical appt is my only outing I purposely go braless because I am asthmatic and have to gown up every time anyways. What a pearl clutching policy. I would be offended to have a dress code at the Dr period and would go elsewhere.", "Why is it your responsibility to tslk to her? If it bothers them, they should speak up. There could be a medical issue that stops her or a financial issue. Maybe just ask her to wear something that makes it less noticeable, like a dark T or heavier material.", "Yeah you would be. Change the dress code if it makes folks that uncomfortable but if she is following the rules she is fine.", "Ehhhh. Withholding judgement until info. \n\nINFO: Are we talking about a normal shirt and the chick is just braless, or are we talking a thing shirt that\u2019s borderline see through and braless? I think that would be one of the big things to notate.", "YWBTA", "No one should be required to wear a bra. MYOB", "I\u2019m so busy being stuck on the fact that they provide health care, but will turn people not dressed for a 9-5 away\u2026 What? So if I\u2019m not feeling well and stay in pjs I can\u2019t get treatment? \n\nAnd if my bra straps are wider than my tank top I can\u2019t get health care? \n\nWTF? This whole office policy is TA.\n\nAlso what\u2019s the legal policy about bras? Both were I live now and where I grew up it\u2019s legal for women to be completely topless - so while businesses can require a top (ala no shirt no service) I\u2019d think, at least where I\u2019m from, you can not legally force them to wear a bra.", "I am clearly a minority of one on this entire thread but I think the reason that undergarments are not specifically mentioned in the dress code is because common Sense would typically dictate that they wouldn't have to be because most people would put them on and try to look somewhat respectful in public... I personally think in certain settings it is appropriate to have and to enforce a dress code, and for visitors to respect that dress code for the sake of others in that setting. Respect for others, self-respect and all that. You should probably let this one slide but revisit the wording of your dress code.  NTA", "Seriously though...it just seems excessive, if I'm going for a regular checkup sure I would obviously be dressed but nine times out of ten if I'm going to the doctor it's because I'm miserable and want comfy clothes.", "That would make it worse. \"We don't care that you can't afford better fitting clothes, get out and go to the ER or something\".", "I can't wear a bra do to health problems. Should I just stay home? Never leave the house cuz I can't wear a bra?! How is that common sense?", "Human beings are naturally attracted to lots of different body parts.", "Just because she sucks, doesn\u2019t mean you have to suck.", "Yeah, I try to keep the peace, he usually only tirades when guys from the floor come shoot the shit with him and it veers towards gas prices or retirement. All of them are good workers but have an archaic set of social \"norms\".", "That is so weird and problematic. Why would you want to make it harder to get treatment?!", "This offices code makes me want to wear the most worn out flannel pj's I can find and a really see thru white tee. I would make sure to leave my jacket in the car and really swing my DDs around. What wankers.", " There's no reason to discuss the dress code.", "I\u2019ll swing these DDs so hard, someone\u2019s getting a black eye!", "Pretty sure I could!"]}
