We don't live together yet but we plan on moving in together around April (I'm finishing renovations in my house). She has a daughter (14) from a previous marriage. I don't really interact with her daughter that much, we'll say hi to each other etc but we've never actually spent any one on one time. On Tuesday my gf called me and asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and take her to lunch because she had to stay late at work. I was free so I agreed. I decided to take my bike because the weather was pretty decent (it was cold but it wasn't raining). So after I picked her daughter up we went for some kebabs and afterwards her daughter asked me if she could ride around with me for a bit before I take her home. I didn't know she was into motorcycles so I thought that this might be my opportunity to \"bond\" with her. So we drove around on some countryside roads for about an hour and then I dropped her off. \n\nThat same evening my gf called me and she was furious that I picked her daughter up from school on my bike. I told her that she never said I couldn't use my bike. We had a small argument and she called me selfish and irresponsible. But I still think I didn't do anything wrong.

My first motorcycle ride, I was 8 months old, in a child seat made for older children on bicycles, rigged up on the back of my dad's Honda CB. \n\nWhen I was 12, my uncle took me to school on his hog, and it wasn't a big deal to anyone.\n\nWhen I was 16, I lost a friend, one of the guys at my school, in a motorcycle accident. He was riding with his dad, they had helmets, they were being safe, it wasn't dark yet, it's a small town, not crazy traffic, but... the drunk teens in the pickup weren't being safe. They were all fine. My friend... well, a helmet only protects your head.\n\nMotorcycles are great. Being *on* a motorcycle, anywhere that anyone else might be driving, comes with a high risk. \n\nAnd it's up to a parent to decide if their kid gets to take that risk.\n\nPeople didn't think about those risks much when I was a kid, where I grew up. If this was the 1980s, or you had no access to the internet, I'd say there is no AH.\n\nBut it's not. It's common knowledge that there's a safety concern with motorcycles. It's common knowledge that some people are violently against motorcycles. You should have known to ask.\n\nIt is not common to assume someone with 2 types of transportation would choose the less safe option to transport a child. Your girlfriend had no reason to assume you would.\n\nYou're in the wrong for sure.\n\nBut beyond that, she told you you shouldn't do something with her child which you'd already done, and instead of just acknowledging her right to make that choice, you argued, and still think you did nothing wrong.

It\u2019s OBJECTIVELY unsafe, compared to a car.\n\nI had a dirt bike, four wheeler, and go kart as a kid. No one was allowed on them without parent permission.

Bikes are far more dangerous than vehicles, no matter what precautions you take. She is a minor and someone else's child, and I'm confused as to how many nta statements on here with the justification you were just doing a kind thing by trying to bond? People do bad/stupid things all the time with good intentions, and it doesn't mean they aren't an asshole at the end of the day. I have a really hard time believing an experienced bike rider would not see picking up an underage child of another person on a bike as an issue. Totally irresponsible. Motorcycle fatalities are 30 times higher than vehicle accidents and that's all that has to be said here.", "YTA\n\nMotorbikes are a risky form of transport. People in motorbike accidents are four times more likely to be injured, and 30 times more likely to be killed, than people in car accidents.

Both you and your girlfriend have different views on motorcycles. I don't think you're an AH since there was no malicious intend whatsoever. However, I would like to recommend trying to be more conscious regarding these kinds of things. Also, talk to your girlfriend, I'm sure she must have been scared for her daughters safety. Open dialogue! Good luck. \n\nI would like to add that my old neighbour was a Harley fan and used to take me and my brother on rides.

You know as a biker how stupidly people drive and how many bikers have accidents that aren\u2019t their fault at all. \n\nAs a parent, I would be furious if someone else had taken her on the back of a bike without permission.

Did you even have proper gear for her?", "YTA. \nWhile I think it was was, indeed, a good opportunity to bond with her, you didn't make sure she had the necessary equipment / clothes so she could ride with you.

I understand the risk, I've taken defensive riding courses and I've dropped my bike enough times over the years that I'm pretty good at the tuck and roll and know how to minimize injuries if someone hits me. A 14 year old who's never ridden before doesn't. If I'm in a car and someone bumps me from behind or cuts me off... oh well, ding on the fender and maybe an air-bag to the face.

Statically, bikes are extremely dangerous compared to cars. There's a reason EMTs call them Donorcycles.

Just apologize for the oversight and tell her you won't do it again without her permission.", "YTA.  Some people don't like motorcycles and don't think they're safe.

You should have checked with your girlfriend first, obviously.", "Yta not because of the trip but without the planing. I assume she didn't have any gear with her in school, because it was a spontaneous thing. As someone who was in an accident before I would never ride around without biker jacket, pants and shoes. The last one I learned the hard way.\nIt can happen really fast. Doesn't matter if your're experienced or not. It doesn't even have to be ypur fault but another driver could not see you which happens quite a lot on a bike and you could fall. The skin is the biggest organ and you have to protect it.\nOne condition to get my motorbike when I was 16 was that I always wear my gear and I'm so thankful for that because it saved me from a lot of damage.\nSorry for this long rant but in short: motorbikes are cool but only with proper gear.", "YTA. It sounds like you have a car and chose to take your motorcycle instead. Many people are uncomfortable with the safety of motorcycles, which I imagine you know. She didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t take your bike because she assumed you would be responsible enough to not take her child on your motorcycle when she hadn\u2019t said it was okay.", "YTA\n\nYou should have cleared it with gf first.  People are weird about motorcycles.  Maybe you had good reason to think gf would be okay with it.  Still should have checked first.

I assume you had no gear for a 14 year old at hand. As a motorcyclist\u2026 that\u2019s so irresponsible. You had neither the permission of her parent nor proper gear.", "YTA.

Motorcycles don't provide anywhere near the same occupant protection as a car, and your GF was trusting you with HER CHILD.

Please remember that your GF literally had to have a safe baby carseat just to take her daughter home from the hospital... and in her mind, that was yesterday in parent years.

You need to do serious damage control, dude.", "Mild YTA.\n\nDid you have an extra helmet? Or any extra gear your GF's daughter could use?\n\nAlso, it was stressed in the motorcycle safety course I took that any passengers should probably also have knowledge of motorcycle safety and maneuvering, like \"lean over the shoulder on the side the driver is leaning on instead of trying to counterbalance\" and things like that. A 14-year-old is not going to know these things, and it could have caused issues.\n\nFinally, you didn't have her mother's permission to take her on the motorcycle and should not have just assumed it would be okay.", "Mild YTA. I\u2019d never let my kid on a motorcycle and I expect the entire world to understand and agree that a motorcycle is an unnecessary risk, but I understand that is just not realistic. I\u2019m sure that how she feels - that of course you should know her kid isn\u2019t allowed on a motorcycle.  Conversely, you don\u2019t agree that motorcycles are inherently unsafe, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have one, so how should you know how she feels about them?\n\nOn balance though, I think you should know better than to take a minor on a motorcycle without explicit permission. \n\nYou should apologize.", "YTA. People have very strong feelings about the risks of motorcycling and you should never take someone's child out without their express permission.", "YTA but not a big one.

I hope you & the daughter get to have a lot more rides.", "It's got to be YTA, sorry. I get that you felt you were doing the right thing here, but motorcycles are dangerous enough even with full (read: racing) gear, and her mother (your partner) absolutely had a right to disallow her minor to ride on the motorcycle with you.\n\nThis is absolutely something you have to discuss BEFORE it happens.", "YTA\n\nBikes are dangerous and she\u2019s a minor.

She\u2019s not your daughter and a lot of people have safety concerns and rules regarding their children and two wheeled vehicles. You may be a great driver but you\u2019re sharing the road with people who aren\u2019t and that\u2019s a big safety decision to make without parental consent. When the thought to take the bike crossed your mind you should have called to ask her mother first.", "YTA. You claiming that your gf not explicitly banning you from doing something means it's okay is so childish. You put your gf's daughter in danger without her mother's knowledge or say.

To me, that's a pretty known norm amongst motorists, but maybe not where you live.

We don't live together yet but we plan on moving in together around April (I'm finishing renovations in my house). She has a daughter (14) from a previous marriage. I don't really interact with her daughter that much, we'll say hi to each other etc but we've never actually spent any one on one time. On Tuesday my gf called me and asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and take her to lunch because she had to stay late at work. I was free so I agreed. I decided to take my bike because the weather was pretty decent (it was cold but it wasn't raining). So after I picked her daughter up we went for some kebabs and afterwards her daughter asked me if she could ride around with me for a bit before I take her home. I didn't know she was into motorcycles so I thought that this might be my opportunity to \"bond\" with her. So we drove around on some countryside roads for about an hour and then I dropped her off. \n\nThat same evening my gf called me and she was furious that I picked her daughter up from school on my bike. I told her that she never said I couldn't use my bike. We had a small argument and she called me selfish and irresponsible. But I still think I didn't do anything wrong.

He was friendly with everyone in my circle, including my ex and my children. He started picking up my (then 13) year old daughter from and taking her shopping when I was at work. He started taking her out on the bike. Said he was serious about me and wanted to be a good step-dad. I objected. I love riding passenger, but I\u2019m an adult.

I didn\u2019t like that. They told me I was jealous. They\u2019d become friends. This is how grooming works. \n\nOne day, I went to go hug this guy, and my daughter looked jealous and hurt. I found that unsettling, and everyone said I was crazy again. \n\nI went through her phone, and you know what I found? \n\nI found out that my 30+ boyfriend was sending salacious texts and photos to my kid. I found out that she believed they were in love, they were sending heart emojis, and reminding each other to delete the texts because I was suspicious. He was grooming her. Apparently he enjoys the attention of little girls.\n\nThank GOD he never got to touch her. Thank GOD my intuition led me to go through that phone like a raving lunatic before it went ANY further. She\u2019s 20 now. Mostly fine, just dysfunctional enough to be witty and smart.\n\nI called a lawyer. I called the cops. We pressed charges. They were tame charges, but he pled guilty and now has a record. I made sure of that so if he ever attempted that shit again, there would be a history.\n\nThis post reminded me of exactly what we went through.

You just assumed that she'd even be willing to ride on an exposed motorcycle in traffic. A lot of kids wouldn't be willing to get on the bike so it was just chance she was willing and actually seemed to like it. \n\nYou made a lot of assumptions and took it upon yourself to make a lot of judgement calls about someone else's child without checking first. \n\nYou sort of put their safety at risk. You are obviously a motorcycle guy and you'll push back against this but bikes are way more dangerous than a car. In a car, if someone isn't paying attention and rearends you, you may have some auto body damage and a neck ache.

Based on the reaction of your GF the daughter doesn\u2019t have any experience as a passenger, and that in itself can be dangerous.   \n\nI\u2019d suggest apologizing and of course promising to never do that again.

He was stopped at a red light, when it turned green he advanced through the intersection only to be hit by a car pulling out of a parking lot - (so nothing unusual or dangerous on his part, still well under speed limit).

Knees in the breeze!", "You\u2019re TA for not asking your girlfriend if it was okay, but I do think it was sweet that she enjoyed it and wanted to ride around some more. Motorcycles are definitely way more dangerous than cars, and I will never get on one due to my husbands father dying from internal bleeding after a wreck. I believe if you had asked and she said yes, it would be completely different. Even if she didn\u2019t say yes, you could\u2019ve possibly waited a while and you may have gotten to experience that bonding at some point a little later on. You always always ask before doing something like this. I fully understand why she would be upset about it.", "Yta....this is coming from someone who frequently rides (as a passenger with my so,as a passenger). First and foremost you should always ask permission from a minors parent/s. Second, I highly doubt you had any protective gear in her size on hand. Did her helmet fit her correctly? Did she have on jeans, boots, and a jacket? I'd be mad too. Some parents don't want their minor child on a bike. Ours rides with dad sometimes but she has her own helmet, riding boots, and jacket.", "YTA as a motorcycle enthusiast, agreed that you need to check first. I hope you had her fully geared up at least - helmet and full gear. If not, you are mega asshole.", "YATA", "Soft YTA. I rode with my kids on the back of my motorcycle when they were young - we even went on a motorcycle tour as a family when my youngest was 9 years old. BUT, they had full gear on. Since you most likely didn't have full gear for the kiddo and you didn't get mom's permission that's what makes you TA. Heart was in the right place with wanting to bond to her but your head wasn't there as well.", "Whoops. You might be single now, chief. If you endangered the life of my child I probably wouldn\u2019t give you a call back.

Think it over, yta", "I\u2019m going to say YTA, not for necessarily taking her on the bike\u2026 but for the simple fact that you didn\u2019t ask her mom first if the bike would be okay. \n\nThis is still a pretty brand new relationship between you and her. You and her daughter are pretty much strangers at this point. It\u2019s very, very important that you do get that extra level of permission when doing anything with anyone\u2019s kids especially when it\u2019s just you and them alone, and ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s something that\u2019s new to the child. \n\nThis is not the time for assumptions, or unspoken permission. Clarify, clarify, clarify. \n\nIf you want to recover this relationship and move forward, apologize to the mom for not asking for clarification first, and resolve with her that you\u2019ll check in to make sure that it\u2019s okay before you introduce her daughter to new things or change routines. \n\nAdditional to this, if you want to take the daughter out on the bike, you NEED to get additional safety equipment that properly fits her. I\u2019m not going to rag on it since everything worked out this time, but before you put a child on a bike, you NEED to properly equip them for any danger. This can go a long way to making the mom feel more comfortable with more bike related trips.", "She never said you couldn\u2019t? No dude, she never said you COULD.

Funnily enough where I live we have spaces just for bike rides on Sunday mornings etc and it's with a lot of other bikers! These kinda things might improve your chances. Just remember, bikes aren't for everyone, people are justifiably afraid of being on them.", "Soft YTA. I completely see why you did it, and it was a great opportunity, but you missed the permission part. You shouldn\u2019t take minors on bikes without explicit permission. The only exception I find to this rule is when you exclusively ride a bike and don\u2019t own a car and then get asked to transport a minor from A to B (in the situation the parents knew this person only had a bike and didn\u2019t own a car, so obviously permission was implied). Anyway, apologize to your girlfriend and next time ask permission.", "YTA. Sorry, a motorcycle is not a standard mode of transportation. It is a dangerous hobby. I am a rock climber and I would never take another adult's child rock climbing without their permission.", "YTA, I don't get why you didn't just ask when you said you'd pick her up. This is not the kind of thing you do with a minor without parental permission. It's not like you took her for a quick lap around a cul-de-sac at a low speed, you were actually out on the road with her.

Common sense on both of those would\u2019ve avoided the whole hoo-hah.", "Yeah, sorry, also a motorcyclist, YTA - should've checked with your girlfriend (and, possibly, her ex-husband) before putting her daughter in danger.
