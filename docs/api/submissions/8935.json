We don't live together yet but we plan on moving in together around April (I'm finishing renovations in my house). She has a daughter (14) from a previous marriage. I don't really interact with her daughter that much, we'll say hi to each other etc but we've never actually spent any one on one time. On Tuesday my gf called me and asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and take her to lunch because she had to stay late at work. I was free so I agreed. I decided to take my bike because the weather was pretty decent (it was cold but it wasn't raining). So after I picked her daughter up we went for some kebabs and afterwards her daughter asked me if she could ride around with me for a bit before I take her home. I didn't know she was into motorcycles so I thought that this might be my opportunity to \"bond\" with her. So we drove around on some countryside roads for about an hour and then I dropped her off. \n\nThat same evening my gf called me and she was furious that I picked her daughter up from school on my bike. I told her that she never said I couldn't use my bike. We had a small argument and she called me selfish and irresponsible. But I still think I didn't do anything wrong.

My first motorcycle ride, I was 8 months old, in a child seat made for older children on bicycles, rigged up on the back of my dad's Honda CB. \n\nWhen I was 12, my uncle took me to school on his hog, and it wasn't a big deal to anyone.\n\nWhen I was 16, I lost a friend, one of the guys at my school, in a motorcycle accident. He was riding with his dad, they had helmets, they were being safe, it wasn't dark yet, it's a small town, not crazy traffic, but... the drunk teens in the pickup weren't being safe. They were all fine. My friend... well, a helmet only protects your head.\n\nMotorcycles are great. Being *on* a motorcycle, anywhere that anyone else might be driving, comes with a high risk. \n\nAnd it's up to a parent to decide if their kid gets to take that risk.\n\nPeople didn't think about those risks much when I was a kid, where I grew up. If this was the 1980s, or you had no access to the internet, I'd say there is no AH.\n\nBut it's not. It's common knowledge that there's a safety concern with motorcycles. It's common knowledge that some people are violently against motorcycles. You should have known to ask.\n\nIt is not common to assume someone with 2 types of transportation would choose the less safe option to transport a child. Your girlfriend had no reason to assume you would.\n\nYou're in the wrong for sure.\n\nBut beyond that, she told you you shouldn't do something with her child which you'd already done, and instead of just acknowledging her right to make that choice, you argued, and still think you did nothing wrong.

She is a minor and someone else's child, and I'm confused as to how many nta statements on here with the justification you were just doing a kind thing by trying to bond? People do bad/stupid things all the time with good intentions, and it doesn't mean they aren't an asshole at the end of the day. I have a really hard time believing an experienced bike rider would not see picking up an underage child of another person on a bike as an issue. Totally irresponsible. Motorcycle fatalities are 30 times higher than vehicle accidents and that's all that has to be said here.", "YTA\n\nMotorbikes are a risky form of transport. People in motorbike accidents are four times more likely to be injured, and 30 times more likely to be killed, than people in car accidents.

Open dialogue! Good luck. \n\nI would like to add that my old neighbour was a Harley fan and used to take me and my brother on rides.

I understand the risks and ride as safely as I can.  It is a risk I accept for myself but would not expose her to.   You know as a biker how stupidly people drive and how many bikers have accidents that aren\u2019t their fault at all. \n\nAs a parent, I would be furious if someone else had taken her on the back of a bike without permission.  No matter how cautiously they rode - it is no one\u2019s else\u2019s decision to make but a child\u2019s parents. \n\nDid you have a professionally fitted helmet for a 14 year old?

I understand the risk, I've taken defensive riding courses and I've dropped my bike enough times over the years that I'm pretty good at the tuck and roll and know how to minimize injuries if someone hits me. A 14 year old who's never ridden before doesn't. If I'm in a car and someone bumps me from behind or cuts me off... oh well, ding on the fender and maybe an air-bag to the face.

Statically, bikes are extremely dangerous compared to cars. There's a reason EMTs call them Donorcycles.

Just apologize for the oversight and tell her you won't do it again without her permission.", "YTA.  Some people don't like motorcycles and don't think they're safe.

Did you have a helmet for her?", "> I still don't think I did anything wrong.\n\nAhh, the anthem of assholes. YTA. You aren't her parent. You should have checked with your girlfriend first, obviously.", "Yta not because of the trip but without the planing. I assume she didn't have any gear with her in school, because it was a spontaneous thing. As someone who was in an accident before I would never ride around without biker jacket, pants and shoes. The last one I learned the hard way.\nIt can happen really fast. Doesn't matter if your're experienced or not. It doesn't even have to be ypur fault but another driver could not see you which happens quite a lot on a bike and you could fall. The skin is the biggest organ and you have to protect it.\nOne condition to get my motorbike when I was 16 was that I always wear my gear and I'm so thankful for that because it saved me from a lot of damage.\nSorry for this long rant but in short: motorbikes are cool but only with proper gear.", "YTA. It sounds like you have a car and chose to take your motorcycle instead. Many people are uncomfortable with the safety of motorcycles, which I imagine you know. She didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t take your bike because she assumed you would be responsible enough to not take her child on your motorcycle when she hadn\u2019t said it was okay.", "YTA\n\nYou should have cleared it with gf first.  People are weird about motorcycles.  Maybe you had good reason to think gf would be okay with it.  Still should have checked first.  Best talk some things out with gf, make sure there are no additional land mines just waiting to go off.", "YTA in that you should have discussed it first but honestly it really does seem like a good bonding opportunity for you guys so I hope she reconsiders even with some limitations", "Does your girlfriend enjoy riding your motorcycle with you?", "YTA. I assume you had no gear for a 14 year old at hand. As a motorcyclist\u2026 that\u2019s so irresponsible. You had neither the permission of her parent nor proper gear.", "YTA.

Just say sorry dude.", "YTA\n\nYou should have asked her first.", "You\u2019d be my ex so fast if this was my daughter. YTA.", "YTA. Motorcycles don't provide anywhere near the same occupant protection as a car, and your GF was trusting you with HER CHILD. You can't just spontaneously go on impulse of \"hey I feel it's a nice say for a ride\" when it comes to the safety of a child. Please remember that your GF literally had to have a safe baby carseat just to take her daughter home from the hospital... and in her mind, that was yesterday in parent years. You also don't mention if you of the kid were wearing helmets...PLEASE tell me that kid had a proper helmet on?\n\nShe's really rattled, and now has serious questions about your judgement about keeping her child safe. You need to do serious damage control, dude.", "Mild YTA.\n\nDid you have an extra helmet? Or any extra gear your GF's daughter could use?\n\nAlso, it was stressed in the motorcycle safety course I took that any passengers should probably also have knowledge of motorcycle safety and maneuvering, like \"lean over the shoulder on the side the driver is leaning on instead of trying to counterbalance\" and things like that. A 14-year-old is not going to know these things, and it could have caused issues.\n\nFinally, you didn't have her mother's permission to take her on the motorcycle and should not have just assumed it would be okay.", "Mild YTA. I\u2019d never let my kid on a motorcycle and I expect the entire world to understand and agree that a motorcycle is an unnecessary risk, but I understand that is just not realistic. I\u2019m sure that how she feels - that of course you should know her kid isn\u2019t allowed on a motorcycle.  Conversely, you don\u2019t agree that motorcycles are inherently unsafe, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have one, so how should you know how she feels about them?\n\nOn balance though, I think you should know better than to take a minor on a motorcycle without explicit permission. \n\nYou should apologize.", "YTA. People have very strong feelings about the risks of motorcycling and you should never take someone's child out without their express permission.", "YTA but not a big one.

I hope you & the daughter get to have a lot more rides.", "It's got to be YTA, sorry. I get that you felt you were doing the right thing here, but motorcycles are dangerous enough even with full (read: racing) gear, and her mother (your partner) absolutely had a right to disallow her minor to ride on the motorcycle with you.\n\nThis is absolutely something you have to discuss BEFORE it happens.", "YTA\n\nBikes are dangerous and she\u2019s a minor.

INFO Did the SD have a helmet and secure gear( not to get burnt , BUT also, there are MANY other injuries she could have incurred if you slid or were in an accident, even a minor one, without proper gear. This is a MINOR child. She had no choice. I doubt a minor can ride anywhere without a helmet( well fitted also needed) Edit: Just scrolled through. No responses yet from OP?!", "YTA. She\u2019s not your daughter and a lot of people have safety concerns and rules regarding their children and two wheeled vehicles. You may be a great driver but you\u2019re sharing the road with people who aren\u2019t and that\u2019s a big safety decision to make without parental consent. When the thought to take the bike crossed your mind you should have called to ask her mother first.", "YTA. You claiming that your gf not explicitly banning you from doing something means it's okay is so childish. You put your gf's daughter in danger without her mother's knowledge or say. You've damaged the trust in your relationship badly with this move.

Like did you take her helmet, a protective jacket, protective pants and protective boots? My husband rides bikes and won\u2019t even let me think about getting on his if I\u2019m not fully geared.", "YTA. You wanna go play sons of anarchy because it\u2019s a nice day out, do you.

We don't live together yet but we plan on moving in together around April (I'm finishing renovations in my house). She has a daughter (14) from a previous marriage. I don't really interact with her daughter that much, we'll say hi to each other etc but we've never actually spent any one on one time. On Tuesday my gf called me and asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and take her to lunch because she had to stay late at work. I was free so I agreed. I decided to take my bike because the weather was pretty decent (it was cold but it wasn't raining). So after I picked her daughter up we went for some kebabs and afterwards her daughter asked me if she could ride around with me for a bit before I take her home. I didn't know she was into motorcycles so I thought that this might be my opportunity to \"bond\" with her. So we drove around on some countryside roads for about an hour and then I dropped her off. \n\nThat same evening my gf called me and she was furious that I picked her daughter up from school on my bike. I told her that she never said I couldn't use my bike. We had a small argument and she called me selfish and irresponsible. But I still think I didn't do anything wrong.
