{"id": 4442, "submission_id": "zi0pq7", "title": "AITA for refusing to attend my father's funeral knowing his family is holding off on the service until I agree to attend?", "selftext": "My mom and dad had 4 children. My dad had a child while they were together. He passed his \"outside\" child off as his cousin's son. Eventually the truth came out and they divorced. We were 2, 3 (me), 4 and 12. The \"outside\" child was 8. After the divorce my father moved out. He started dating another woman in the neighborhood and cut us off. I was in middle school when I found out my dad was only a few blocks away. My father leaves the state, starts another family (has a daughter and a son) and moves on with his life. \n\nFast forward: my oldest sibling got married when he was in his early 20's. He invited our father, his mother, 2 of his brothers and the \"outside\" sibling. I was around 12. This is the first time I'm meeting these people besides my father. After the wedding my siblings and I went out of state to get to know my father's side of the family. While visiting we found out that our father's mother took summer vacations in our home state and was only a half hour away from us for several years, and she never tried to see us. \n\nA decade later our mom passes away. My father attends the service and again brings his mom, his 2 brother's and his son. Due to the time lapse I didn't know who they were. My father was extremely offended I didn't recognize him. After the service they leave and every one goes their own way. A decade later I get a call that my father passed away and his family wants his original 4 children to attend the service. I was told they will hold off on the funeral until we agree to attend. He died two weeks ago and his family is asking me to forgive him. The original 4 children are in our 40's and 50's. I feel him and his family had time to reach out to us BEFORE he died.\n\nAITA for refusing to attend his service? I don't know him. I've only been around him a handful of times. The last time we spoke was 9 years ago when he berated me for not attending his mother's funeral. I explained to him I've only been around his mother 4 or 5 times in my life and didn't feel comfortable attending. He said I was selfish. Several family members stated my other siblings will go if I go. I don't want to, but now I'm thinking my siblings might need closer and maybe I should reconsider.\n\n**Update** \nI contacted my 2 siblings who are close in age with me this afternoon. I asked them if they wanted to go to the service and if so, did they need me with them. They said they didn't need me to go, but they were considering going, but need the funeral date for work. They both drive trucks. I contacted my niece to find out if my oldest brother wanted to attend the funeral. She replied with \"we already went\". His service was this morning. \n\nHow did this happen you ask? Well, the only person I was talking to was my half-sister. She was the one relaying the information to me. And I was disseminating the information to my siblings. This entire time she has been blowing smoke up my behind to make a fool out of me. None of my father's siblings cared if the original kids showed up. My oldest sibling knew about the service and took my niece. He didn't see a need to tell the rest of us.\n\nWhy am I upset? Number (1) she made a fool out of me to my siblings and (2) all of them took the choice away from my 2 siblings. I don't know if they wanted to see our father before he was buried, but we'll never know because they were never given the choice to go. \n\nTo add insult to injury that heffa had the audacity to say we need to let the past be in the past and come together as a family. That is a hard pass.
