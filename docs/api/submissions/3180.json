He has trouble expressing how he feels and throws physical tantrums (hitting, spitting, grabbing people, etc.) whenever he doesn't get his way. He hates being ignored for over 10 minutes, so taking care of him is a handful. \n\nI'm a senior in high school and have this whole week off (conferences and Thanksgiving break). I missed two weeks of school because of personal reasons and have been working my ass off all week trying to catch up.\n\nNo one in my family celebrates Thanksgiving, so my aunt volunteered at the last minute to work today. Because of this, she couldn't find anyone willing to babysit Jack for 9 hours, so she made a sudden appearance at our house at 7am and explained the situation to me, then asked if I could take care of Jack for 8 hours. I refused and told her she should have either not volunteered to work, or volunteered earlier in the week. I told her I had to continue working on schoolwork, but she told me I could work while keeping an eye on Jack. I reminded her of Jack's neediness and said no work would be completed with him around. She then yelled at me and said that Jack was more important than my school work, but walked off with Jack anyways.\n\nShe sent me a text saying I was a \"selfish child that would get nowhere in life\" if I continued being \"immature\". She had apparently text my mother, too, because half an hour later, I got a call from my mother, who was pissed. She scolded me for forcing my aunt to miss work.\n\nI'm currently grounded for a month, I can't hang out with friends, and I have to do chores on the weekdays and weekends until Christmas Eve. I tried calling my aunt to apologize, but she hung up on me, so I sent a text, but it was left on read.\n\nI'm currently regretting my decision and want to know if I'm an asshole for not babysitting my cousin.", "created_utc": 1669351245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z442pz/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_cousin_on_my_day_off/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your aunt is an asshole here, but your mother might be the true asshole of the story. She has no business punishing you for this - poor parenting.", "So you were supposed to neglect your education because your aunt showed up with zero notice expecting you to care for her special needs child? This would be inexcusable unless it were a true emergency (e.g. someone needs to go to the hospital, house burned down, or something like that). Her failure to plan ahead is not your emergency. NTA.", "NTA. That's a lot of pressure to put on a 17 year old and very unfair to you.", "Obviously you are NTA, however your aunt and mother are both assholes. You are not obligated to take care of somebody else's child especially not one who's such high maintenance. Your aunt should have arranged for childcare. If your mother is so high and mighty on babysitting she should volunteer herself. Your aunt at least should have offered you some sort of compensation as opposed to trying to force it on you.", "Your main focus right now is your studies, not your cousin.

Your Mother was also completely in the wrong.", "NTA. You had school work to catch up on, and your aunt is an AH for assuming she could just show up and dump your cousin on you. Your mom is also an AH for grounding you.", "NTA.  No one should be forced to be free childcare for a special needs child.  They demanded then you said no, it doesn't matter if you had plans or not.  Then OP was insulted, shamed and bullied by 2 older females who fn should know better.  The punishment would make me never want to ever extend another courtesy for the Aunt because OP is being punished for not being a willing servant.", "NTA! She just showed up without even asking first?! This is a child that requires specialized care.

What jerks. \n\nDefinitely NTA, op.", "NTA, you really can't force kids on people like that!\n\nI'm mostly concerned about the boy though, he probably needs a lot of stability and care. Just throwing him around won't do much good I'm afraid.", "NTA. You aunt's poor planning and poor decision making caused her to miss work. He's not your child, you're a minor, and you had schoolwork. Your mom seems pretty vile for not only not caring enough about your education, but grounding you for this. I do feel maybe your aunt fed your mom lies to make herself seem better in this, but still doesn't excuse either of them.", " NTA-Your aunt forced your aunt to miss work. Her lack of planning is not yours to fix .", "NTA - Your aunt obviously showed up thinking you would agree and took it out on you when you didn\u2019t listen to her. That\u2019s on her. You are not obliged to care for your cousin and good for you for saying no. Your mom is a huge asshole for getting influenced by her sister and grounding you.

Your mom knows this. Why are they OK with you being assaulted by your cousin? Why were you even considered an option? Age 8 may be young, but children can still do some damage at that age.

You are also in no position of mandatory responsibility for him. You are simply regretting your mother\u2019s harsh response. Keep your nose in your books, to better quality for scholarships and grants. Then get the hell out of Dodge.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to care for your aunt\u2019s child.

And people with children too often assume that their relatives should drop everything to take care of their kids.\n\nI am sorry that your aunt put you in this position and that your mother is endorsing this attitude.  You should not have to apologize for having boundaries.\n\nYour mom is probably mad because your aunt was mad at her for not raising a more compliant daughter.  I think when everyone cools off a bit, you might try talking to her about how you felt your aunt was not being fair to you.   If she is going to volunteer to work, she needs to make sure you are free. And school is a student\u2019s \u201cjob.\u201d", "NTA\n\nWTF is up with your mom de-prioritizing her son's education? There's no excuse for that.", "NTA. You are not responsible for her kid and your parents are huge assholes", "NTA, I am so sorry this is happening to you.  You deserve so much better.  Your aunt is sickeningly entitled, & if your mom is enabling her.  Reading this as a mom makes me absolutely livid for you.", "NTA, and what the hell are they grounding you for? This is super ridiculous, I\u2019m sorry for you. \n\nFirst of all, why didn\u2019t your aunt call before she brought your cousin? I don\u2019t understand these people who are just bringing their kid and drop them off somewhere. What if you were not there or had plans to go somewhere? Anyways you already had plans, you had schoolwork to finish, which is important for your future. And they can\u2019t expect you to do your schoolwork while watching a child. \n\nIt is not YOUR problem that your aunt didn\u2019t plan ahead. She screwed up and you are the one being punished for it, which is unfair. Sadly there is not much you can do against it, so I\u2019m afraid you have to just get through next month.", "NTA, I wonder if your aunt gave your mom a different version of events.", "ah, NO  NTA -\n\nYour Aunt is an AH and your Mom is doing a great imitation of one as well.\n\nYour Aunt was responsible for missing work - you did not FORCE her to miss work, her being unprepared and volunteering to work prior to having a sitter secured is the reason she missed work.  She was incredibly rude and entitled in just expecting you to babysit just because you are off school - even if you didn't have homework to catch up on she should NOT have assumed that you would babysit. It is NOT your job - it is HER child. A child that requires a lot more time and effort to keep an eye on. You were under NO obligation -  YOU are a child, not even HER child - you are not a built in babysitting service. She didn't ask ahead of time she just expected you to do it.  WHY didn't your Mom babysit her nephew?  Was she working too?\n\nYou need to try to sit down with your Mom and ask her if you are expected to always do whatever someone else wants you to do? Are you not allowed to say NO or have any boundaries for yourself?  Ask Mom how upset she would have been and how much trouble you'd be in if you did not get all of your work done to catch up for school?  If that doesn't work you may consider showing your Mom this post and everyone who says you AREN'T the ah. Maybe that will wake her up and show her this was just so wrong on so many levels. \n\nYour Mom is being unreasonable and your Aunt is being an AH in calling your Mom, and not accepting your apology (that I really don't think you needed to give as you did nothing wrong so she isn't entitled to one anyway.)\n\nHang in there - you did nothing wrong hon. You ARE entitled to say NO, especially when the request was last minute and inconvenient.", "You did absolutely nothing wrong as this is not your child, not your choice and not your responsibility in any way shape or form.
