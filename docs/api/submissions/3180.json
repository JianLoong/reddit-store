He hates being ignored for over 10 minutes, so taking care of him is a handful. \n\nI'm a senior in high school and have this whole week off (conferences and Thanksgiving break). I missed two weeks of school because of personal reasons and have been working my ass off all week trying to catch up.\n\nNo one in my family celebrates Thanksgiving, so my aunt volunteered at the last minute to work today. Because of this, she couldn't find anyone willing to babysit Jack for 9 hours, so she made a sudden appearance at our house at 7am and explained the situation to me, then asked if I could take care of Jack for 8 hours. I refused and told her she should have either not volunteered to work, or volunteered earlier in the week. I told her I had to continue working on schoolwork, but she told me I could work while keeping an eye on Jack. I reminded her of Jack's neediness and said no work would be completed with him around. She then yelled at me and said that Jack was more important than my school work, but walked off with Jack anyways.\n\nShe sent me a text saying I was a \"selfish child that would get nowhere in life\" if I continued being \"immature\". She had apparently text my mother, too, because half an hour later, I got a call from my mother, who was pissed. She scolded me for forcing my aunt to miss work.\n\nI'm currently grounded for a month, I can't hang out with friends, and I have to do chores on the weekdays and weekends until Christmas Eve. I tried calling my aunt to apologize, but she hung up on me, so I sent a text, but it was left on read.\n\nI'm currently regretting my decision and want to know if I'm an asshole for not babysitting my cousin.", "created_utc": 1669351245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z442pz/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_cousin_on_my_day_off/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not your kid, not your problem. And If your mom was that upset no one would watch Jack why did she not volunteer?", "NTA. This makes me so sad. Assuming this insane punishment is a normal reaction from your mother, you should prepare yourself to get as far away as possible from her for college or whatever comes next in life without her financial assistance. I definitely envision her trying to trap you at home to continue assisting your aunt or with whatever else they might need. Your aunt and mom are going to be shocked when they realize you don't want a relationship with them in the future because of how they treat you like free labor now. Your nephew also isn't likely getting the support he needs if they are forcing him on you, so your aunt and mom are 100% the assholes.", "NTA but your aunt and mom are. Never babysit Jack again, even if they keep grounding you for it.", "NTA  As others have said your Aunt should have called ahead of time and asked. Your Mom should have respected your decision to work on your schoolwork. I also agree with trying to discuss it with your mother after a day or two. You may even consider writing your mother a note, text or email in which you lay out your view on the issue. In a written communication you can read-rewrite what you want to say. It also gives your mom a chance to read and then reread what you have to say. Try to be logical and not emotional. Do not be accusing but feel free to ask her what wrong you truly committed to earn a moth of restriction. \n\nSo (of course use your own word. This are just some suggestions)\n1) I was behind in my school work and had to use my time to catch up\n2) Aunt volunteered to work without asking me and she said no one else was willing to babysit.\n\t\tIf she had called me ahead of time she would not have waisted time showing up at the house.\n \t\tIt is a shame Aunt had to miss work but it is not my responsibility. I did not cause Aunt to miss work.\n\t\tI had not agreed ahead of time to sit for her.\n3) Cousin requires 100% of a sitters attention and can become violent; I could not do any of my schoolwork while watching him.\n\n4) Why are you mad at me? Please explain exactly what I did wrong. I\u2019m sorry Aunt called you and realize she probably yelled at you like she yelled at me. I realize you probably lashed out at me because you were responding to her anger. I was hurt that she would call me a \u201cshellfish child that would get nowhere in life\u201d. If she would say that to me I can only image what she would say to you. Do you feel like Aunt does that her son is more important than my schoolwork? I know he is her son and should be her first priority. But I feel my schooling should be my first priority. I feel that Aunt owes me an apology for yelling at me, texting a nasty text and trying to get me in trouble for doing what she wanted. \n\n\nIf I were you I would let both your mom and Aunt know that you don\u2019t want sit your cousin in the future. \n\nI have a good friend who has an autistic son. My son has Asperger\u2019s. So, my daughter who is 8 years older than her brother knows how to deal with some of the behaviors that are quite common and some that are not so common. My daughter used to sit my friends son, But when my friends son started hitting and getting aggressive with my daughter I put a stop to her sitting. I told my friend she could not sit her son any more because he was lashing out. I got upset because my friend was aware he was getting aggressive. He was hitting her. \n\nGood luck", "NTA at all. Your aunt is a disgusting person who\u2019s behavior is likely going to end up leading to you resenting Jack.

Mom was wrong for yelling at you, auntie was wrong for ASSUMING her emergency was YOUR'S to handle.
