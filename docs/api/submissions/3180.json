He has trouble expressing how he feels and throws physical tantrums (hitting, spitting, grabbing people, etc.) whenever he doesn't get his way. He hates being ignored for over 10 minutes, so taking care of him is a handful.\n\nI'm a senior in high school and have this whole week off (conferences and Thanksgiving break). I missed two weeks of school because of personal reasons and have been working my ass off all week trying to catch up.\n\nNo one in my family celebrates Thanksgiving, so my aunt volunteered at the last minute to work today. Because of this, she couldn't find anyone willing to babysit Jack for 9 hours, so she made a sudden appearance at our house at 7am and explained the situation to me, then asked if I could take care of Jack for 8 hours. I refused and told her she should have either not volunteered to work, or volunteered earlier in the week. I told her I had to continue working on schoolwork, but she told me I could work while keeping an eye on Jack. I reminded her of Jack's neediness and said no work would be completed with him around. She then yelled at me and said that Jack was more important than my school work, but walked off with Jack anyways.\n\nShe sent me a text saying I was a \"selfish child that would get nowhere in life\" if I continued being \"immature\". She had apparently text my mother, too, because half an hour later, I got a call from my mother, who was pissed. She scolded me for forcing my aunt to miss work.\n\nI'm currently grounded for a month, I can't hang out with friends, and I have to do chores on the weekdays and weekends until Christmas Eve. I tried calling my aunt to apologize, but she hung up on me, so I sent a text, but it was left on read.\n\nI'm currently regretting my decision and want to know if I'm an asshole for not babysitting my cousin.\n\nEdit:\n\n\\- My mother has been busy with work for the past 2 weeks. She worked on Thanksgiving and was already at her job 1.5 hours away when my aunt and Jack stopped by, which was why my mother was not able to take care of Jack.  \n\\- Jack doesn't go to school because of his aggression. My aunt tried sending him to a school with a Special Education program, but he assaulted the teachers and students the whole time he was there.  \n\\- For the record, I do not hate him in any way and do not blame him for his behavior.  \n\\- Jack's father is out of the picture, as well as mine. There are other people in my family, but they favor my mother and aunt over me and would side with them in a heartbeat.  \n\\- I talked to my mom an hour ago and she did get a text yesterday before my aunt tried to drop Jack off, but forgot to tell me about it.", "created_utc": 1669351245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z442pz/aita_for_not_babysitting_my_cousin_on_my_day_off/", "score": 1954, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make a fuss about how worried you are about your future so you\u2019re prioritising your schoolwork over everything else. Oh, and your parents have said you have chores to do, so you have to do them. Oh wait. It looks like you don\u2019t have any time at all to babysit. Ever again. Under any circumstances. Isn\u2019t that a shame?\n\nCompletely refuse to babysit again unless an agreement is drawn up and signed that guarantees you a minimum notice period, right to refuse, and reasonable payment at the going rate for a local babysitter. Don\u2019t let them take advantage of you just because you\u2019re \u2018family\u2019.", "No your not, you where using the time to catch up on school work  you are not obliged to babysit, especially if your at risk while doing so", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem. And If your mom was that upset no one would watch Jack why did she not volunteer?", "NTA. This makes me so sad. Assuming this insane punishment is a normal reaction from your mother, you should prepare yourself to get as far away as possible from her for college or whatever comes next in life without her financial assistance. I definitely envision her trying to trap you at home to continue assisting your aunt or with whatever else they might need. Your aunt and mom are going to be shocked when they realize you don't want a relationship with them in the future because of how they treat you like free labor now. Your nephew also isn't likely getting the support he needs if they are forcing him on you, so your aunt and mom are 100% the assholes.", "NTA but your aunt and mom are. Never babysit Jack again, even if they keep grounding you for it.", "NTA  As others have said your Aunt should have called ahead of time and asked. Your Mom should have respected your decision to work on your schoolwork. I also agree with trying to discuss it with your mother after a day or two. You may even consider writing your mother a note, text or email in which you lay out your view on the issue. In a written communication you can read-rewrite what you want to say. It also gives your mom a chance to read and then reread what you have to say. Try to be logical and not emotional. Do not be accusing but feel free to ask her what wrong you truly committed to earn a moth of restriction. \n\nSo (of course use your own word. This are just some suggestions)\n1) I was behind in my school work and had to use my time to catch up\n2) Aunt volunteered to work without asking me and she said no one else was willing to babysit.\n\t\tIf she had called me ahead of time she would not have waisted time showing up at the house.\n \t\tIt is a shame Aunt had to miss work but it is not my responsibility. I did not cause Aunt to miss work.\n\t\tI had not agreed ahead of time to sit for her.\n3) Cousin requires 100% of a sitters attention and can become violent; I could not do any of my schoolwork while watching him.\n\n4) Why are you mad at me? Please explain exactly what I did wrong. I\u2019m sorry Aunt called you and realize she probably yelled at you like she yelled at me. I realize you probably lashed out at me because you were responding to her anger. I was hurt that she would call me a \u201cshellfish child that would get nowhere in life\u201d. If she would say that to me I can only image what she would say to you. Do you feel like Aunt does that her son is more important than my schoolwork? I know he is her son and should be her first priority. But I feel my schooling should be my first priority. I feel that Aunt owes me an apology for yelling at me, texting a nasty text and trying to get me in trouble for doing what she wanted. \n\n\nIf I were you I would let both your mom and Aunt know that you don\u2019t want sit your cousin in the future. \n\nI have a good friend who has an autistic son. My son has Asperger\u2019s. So, my daughter who is 8 years older than her brother knows how to deal with some of the behaviors that are quite common and some that are not so common. My daughter used to sit my friends son, But when my friends son started hitting and getting aggressive with my daughter I put a stop to her sitting. I told my friend she could not sit her son any more because he was lashing out. I got upset because my friend was aware he was getting aggressive. He was hitting her. \n\nGood luck", "NTA at all. Your aunt is a disgusting person who\u2019s behavior is likely going to end up leading to you resenting Jack.

Because you, like mommy and auntie dearest, are guilt-tripping OOP for prioritizing her school work\u2014*her* job\u2014over being forced into a last-minute babysitter gig for a special needs child by a grownup who evidently doesn\u2019t know the word \u201cproactivity\u201d if it tripped her.", "I hate reading comments to a missing post.", "Your buddy sounds like helicopter Maverick!", ">Wow. Imagining that child\u2019s experiences and future makes me feel nauseous\n\nImagine their younger siblings' experiences and future, too. Their experiences included having a 7-year-old with a first-grade education as their daytime caretaker. And I doubt that when the adults came home from their day of work, or of doing drugs, or whatever they did during the day, they were attentive, responsible guardians.", "NTA, but why are you trying to apologize?\n\nYou should not feel bad, for working on your future, trying to make good grades.\n\nYour Aunt and your mother are T A.", "NTA but I would say to the aunt as \u201can immature and selfish child\u201d I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the right person to ever provide child care.", "NTA\n\nYour studies are defo more important than a cousin who is not your dependent! You aunt should definitely plan it better, not just dump him onto you willy nilly, no warning in advance! \n\n>She sent me a text saying I was a \"selfish child that would get nowhere in life\" if I continued being \"immature\".\n\nThis right here? It would make me count my days till I could leave! Your aunt was throwing a tantrum and being immature herself just because she didn't get her way! Attacking you like that is childish AF. The fact that your mother and the rest of your family did not take your side just shows how they see you.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your problem. You should make it in life and then when you see your aunt run it in her face that you made it.", "NTA and you didn't force your aunt to miss work.  Her lack of planning and her sense of entitlement to your time did. What a horrible take from your mom. I'm sorry that you got punished for this.  you really aren't qualified to take care of a child that got thrown out of a special needs school for abusing the teachers and students.  It's not fair that burden got put on you.", "NTA, adults that take advantage of older kid family members for free forced childcare are straight trash.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your mother doesn\u2019t have your back. Aunt is a fully grown adult and could have planned ahead, you\u2019re absolutely right. You didn\u2019t make your aunt miss work, she did that all herself.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re the only one with any common sense in this family. You do your schoolwork, do well in school, and GTFO as soon as you can.", "NTA.\nWow.. that is so wrong.", "NTA. \n\nNot your kid, you have no obligation.", "NTA.  Your cousin isn't your responsibility.  And your schoolwork is more important than anything right now..it's how you get away from your situation.", "NTA. The fact that you opted to catch up on missed schoolwork and communicated that you weren't in a position to care for your cousin indicates that you are in fact responsible by the way. On the other hand, your aunt scheduled work with no realistic plan for your cousins care which was irresponsible. Your cousin is your aunts responsibility not yours. You are the victim here. Do not apologise.", "NTA. Stay focused on your studies and get out of the toxic environment you live in. The AH is your mom for grounding you for saying no and standing up for yourself.", "I wonder if OP's mum has even gotten OP's side of the story? I wouldn't be surprised of the aunt twisted things or outright lied.", "It seems like the aunt is clearly not equipped to care for this child. OP should consider calling CPS.", "By focusing on her studies, it will allow OP to move away from these dreadful people.", "OP could call CPS for the fact that this woman clearly can't care for her own child.", "Plus OP is nearly 18 anyways and will legally be able to move out on her own.", "Plus it sounds like OP is equipped to care for the child anyways given the level of violence in the child.", "Exactly. I'm surprised the aunt even wants OP to babysit Jack at all, shouldn't she want a babysitter who's trained to work with special needs kids? Funny how she thinks Jack should be more important than OP's homework but apparently thinks he's not important enough to find professionals to help him deal with his outbursts.", "NTA your aunt is", "NTA and your mother is being very unfair.  You should never have to babysit an aggressive, violent child who is too much for the professionals at the special ed classes.  Never.   And certainly not when he's dropped off with no warning, no request, no question as to whether you're free and not busy with other things.  They are treating you like a servant and get mad when you refuse to be treated that way.  And now it turns out it's partly your mother's fault because she didn't tell you when she knew your aunt wanted you to babysit.  She should ground herself and take away her own phone since she obviously doesn't know how to use it.   I don't know what you can do about those unfair punishments.  Hopefully showing her the results here will open her eyes a bit.", "NTA- your aunt is wrong in so many ways. You will acchieve many things because you understand how to prioritize and you stand up for yourself. Your parents and aunt are all assholes, sorry.", "He was kicked out of school for assaulting teachers and his mother expects a highschooler to take care of him?\n\nWTF?\n\nNTA, OP. This kid needs specialist care, if what you said is the case. you can't just hand a child off to any random babysitter if the teachers at a spec-ed school are unable to control him. Your aunt is closing her eyes as to the requirements of her child. I can kinda understand her predicament based on my understanding of US social care, but that doesn't make it ok for her to dump a serious problem child onto a teenager.\n\nWhy are her kid's needs more important than yours? You're still a kid, too and your needs are no less important. Your schoolwork is your future. Don't sacrifice it for adults who should know better.", "NTA.  Your Aunt is trying to bully and take advantage of you.  Shame on your mom for siding with her.", "NTA in any way shape or form. Your aunt (& mother) are putting parenting responsibilities on you, and you\u2019re not a parent. When someone needs childcare, you ask.  And if the answer is no, you get over it. They aren\u2019t owed something just because they asked. You being punished for not giving in to their demands is wrong, and I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re making you feel this way.", "OP could even threaten to call CPS on the aunt and point out that she can legally move out in less than a year.", "True. Sometimes, distance is the best solution.", "I am not speaking towards whether the grounding was legitimate or not. I don\u2019t think she should be grounded. So I don\u2019t know why you are being intentionally obtuse. She will get grounded if she says no. So she might not want to say no anymore because it will happen either way but one way she is grounded and one way she is not. It is not that complicated. Mom is clearly an AH, but she still has to live with her until she is able to move out. Ffs she will either be not grounded and babysit or grounded and not babysit. She can literally choose between those two options. Which sucks but once again is her reality.", "If you sort by Oldest\u2014>newest, the first comment is the automatic copy of the missing post. It\u2019s a doozy.", "I didn't say you were. I said that she may have weighed the chance of being grounded against the severity of what she's being asked to do and decided that being grounded was worth it.", "I have a feeling that mom is the type to ground her and make her do it anyways.", "Ugh. Heartbreaking. Parents like that make me so sad & angry."]}
