He was trying to get around the rules. It\u2019s not your job to protect him from his stupid actions. Knowing he was trying to circumvent policy and not acting could have gotten you in trouble and he is TA for putting you in that position.", "NTA. Tom knew it was against company policy and used you to get his wife\u2019s company the potential business.  If you hadn\u2019t said something and the contract went through and this was later discovered, you could have been the one in trouble.", "NTA, your co worker is the jerk here because he used you to further his own ends. You are protecting yourself by sharing what you know. A guy like Tom would probably be happy to put blame on you if a scheme of his backfired in some way. I would be very cautious interacting with him from now on", "Nta.\nMost companies have very strict ethics and compliance when it comes to suppliers because no one wants to deal with any potential investigation or lawsuit for breaking laws. \nIf there had been a disclosure at the beginning there might not have been a problem, but because he specifically didn't tell you that Sam was his wife, that makes the waters muddy. \n\nYou did the right thing, and if he gets in trouble that's his own fault.", "NTA he knew what he was doing was against company policy, especially because he want to your manager first then to you...", "NTA.

It's not a matter of \"snitching\" or \"telling on him.\" You are responsible for your own welfare & livelihood. And Tom is responsible for his.  If you truly thought your job record was at risk, then you did what you thought was best and what you thought was right.

You absolutely did the right thing.", "\\+1 on this. I've worked in places that dealt with this much more severely (federal contracting).
