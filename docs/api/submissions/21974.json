Rest easy knowing that as long as there's nothing she can legally do to get the house, there's also nothing she can do to manipulate you into giving it to her.", "NTA, but now you and your brother own the house. Just because the divorce says she is *allowed* to live there doesn't mean you can't evict her.", "NTA at all!  And frankly - unless it's written in a legally binding contract somewhere that she gets life use of the house until she's dead, I would consider letting her know that if she doesn't cut the shit, she will be receiving an eviction notice.", "NTA. It would be your home to do what you want. If she wants it she has every right to buy it from you though.", "NAH, not till all the facts are known. Your mom can grouse all she wants to but your dad is leaving the house to their children when he dies with her still having life estate (I think it\u2019s called) to live there.
