Last week we were supposed to stay 3 nights because there was a meeting at the company. My husband asked me if I was willing to go and I said yes.\n\nMy MIL got 2 rooms ready. My husbands room for him and another room for me and the baby. Josh asked why and my MIL said \"well you have to get up early tomorrow and the baby won't let you sleep\". My husband said that it was not needed and we would sleep together like always. In the evening me and Josh went to bathe Sarah MIL said that it was inappropriate for Josh to bathe Sarah because she is a girl.  While having dinner Josh took Sarah from me so I could eat and BIL complimented on how helpful Josh was. Then the wife of BIL commented \"usually moms do this whatever\". (SIL doesn't like me cause I have never been like them while SIL and BIL still live with MIL and FIL).\n\nFinally we went to bed and Sarah woke up in the middle of the night. Josh woke up and said he'd take care of her. A few minutes later MIL and SIL stormed in to my room and said \"Wake up Sarah is crying\" I said \"josh is taking care of her\" and she said \"aren't you the mother? Josh has a meeting in the morning\". Then Josh came in the room with Sarah asleep and he told MIL and SIL to leave.\n\nWhen we woke up at 7am Sarah was gone. Me and Josh ran downstairs and MIL had taken Sarah to the garden. I ran in tears and got my baby and MIL said \"well all you do is sleep\". Josh told MIL she should have let us know even if it was just with a note. At the breakfast table MIL and SIL both commented on how I let my husband do everything. I snapped and said \"well I didn't make this baby alone. The father is right here and parenting is done by both parents. If needed he will be sleepless he will feed her bathe her and dress her. Josh doesn't mind helping out so why is it any of your concern? You should ask yourselves what you were doing in the room of a married man without even knocking the door instead of commenting on how bad of a mom I am. I told SIL \"if you know it so much better go f\\*cking make your own child\" Keep your noses out of my marriage and mind your own goddamn business.\n\nI left the table and Josh came with me and told me to pack my bag and we would go to our home. We have 2 workers in our home who live with us and help us out with everything. Josh brought me home went to the meeting and came back. He even apologized for taking me there when he knew his mom. My phone has been blowing up with YTA messages from people. Husband, SIL (husband's bio sister), BIL and my family are on my side.

Good on you and your husband for voicing your opinions and for him being so visibly supportive in the house of his family.\n\nA strong marriage has TWO participants, it's nice if others are supportive... But I've never seen the over-involvement of others turn out well.", "Or showing this entire separate way of doing things threatens their deep rooted belief that theirs is the best way. Some people do anything to prove to themselves that they are not wrong.", "I wouldnt say exactly jealous but more angry and sad and frustrated. Here they are, fulfilling all duties they think they need to fulfill, adhering to (their own) female standards of suffering, protecting the male from all of that and \"sacrificing\" themselves and having male persons who expect that from them, and then OP comes around and actually has a helping husband and gets to rest a bit and take turns cartering to the baby, as it should be, not being a single mom to a baby and an adult men. That makes all their work unnecessary, questions all their identity of a sacrificing female person and they realise OP is no less of a woman and leads an \"easier\" life without getting \"punished\" for it, its possible. That probably challenges their whole world view of gender roles and their own identities.", "We live in a very big city. They live on one end we on the other it is a 1hr drive without traffic. I don't see them much anyway. Josh sees his brother and dad at work almost every day but I do like FIL and BIL they are not judgmental lol. I love Josh and he knows that I am not comfortable around MIL and SIL which is why he always asks me if I want to visit or not before saying yes or no to them.

We drink alcohol for example and I was raised really free by my parents. I always was allowed to wear whatever I wanted go where I wanted and have fun. My husband accepted me the way I am and he and I are very much the same. Even though he was raised differently we are still the same when it comes to having fun drinking alcohol etc. My husband does go to the mosque to pray on special days and he participates with ramadan. I however don't but I would wake up and make him sahuur every night for example. Wouldn't put alcohol on the table during ramadan and we respect each other the way we are.", "Actually, such behavior is not always related to religion, but to mindset.\n\nSometimes its like something related to the culture or environment such people live in. Like in some eastern asian non-religious families there are real traditional patriarchatical view on the gender roles in marriage.\n\nOr there are such examples in some western non-religious families, even in usa, where somehow it is expected for women to become a SAHM when they give birth to the children without any concern whether wife wants it or not. \n\nIn these 2 examples the main reason is not a religion, but some \"traditional\" view on gender roles. And its not always directed to the women, but sometimes men also. Like, frown upon a paternal leave from work to take care of newborn children, because its financially more advantagious for the family budget. Or when men are demanded to have higher salaries than their partners.\n\nIn overall, its messed up.", "What does that has to do with being Muslim\ud83d\ude02", "That's sweet, it's good you have such a relationship with your husband", "It is, she said 'they are religious' and their whole attitude refers to Muslim, which OP told me that they are Muslims indeed, what you say is not the case here but yep it's still a thing in general.", "I just replied to the comment above to give them an idea of our lifestyle and the differences between my husband's family and us.

A man leaves his parents and becomes one with his wife. There is no religious mandate that says that a married couple need to live with their parents. It happened in Biblical times because help was needed with farming and raising of animals but even then most couples eventually started their own farms.\n\n*My MIL got 2 rooms ready. My husbands room for him and another room for me and the baby. Josh asked why and my MIL said \"well you have to get up early tomorrow and the baby won't let you sleep\". My husband said that it was not needed and we would sleep together like always. In the evening me and Josh went to bathe Sarah MIL said that it was inappropriate for Josh to bathe Sarah because she is a girl. While having dinner Josh took Sarah from me so I could eat and BIL complimented on how helpful Josh was. Then the wife of BIL commented \"usually moms do this whatever\".    A few minutes later MIL and SIL stormed in to my room and said \"Wake up Sarah is crying\" I said \"josh is taking care of her\" and she said \"aren't you the mother? Josh has a meeting in the morning\".* \n\nSo MIL and SIL think that you are failing in your 'womanly' duties because Josh actively parents his child? Are they stuck in the 1840's? You do not have to justify the way you parent and the type of marriage that you have. Don't be afraid to tell your MIL that she should not be provoking her child to anger (Ephesians 6:4) by meddling in his marriage. Do MIL and SIL really think that God approves of them meddling in your marriage? Tell them a good Christian marriage has just two humans in it- the husband and wife. The only other entity in the marriage is God. Therefore each time they meddle in your marriage, they are disobeying God who put your marriage together (Matthew 10:9). It is not their place to tell you how to parent.\n\nIf Josh can find employment elsewhere, he should leave his family's  company. I would block all the busybodies phone numbers (it's also a sin to gossip and spread rumors), especially your MIL and SIL. Josh needs to tell them that you two have found a way to parent your child. They don't have to like it but they will have to respect it. And if they can  not, they they will be put in a time out.
