He works at his family company with his dad. 1 month ago I gave birth to our beautiful daughter Sarah. My MIL is very religious and old schooled and even made a whole fuss when we decided to live in our own home when we married. Last week we were supposed to stay 3 nights because there was a meeting at the company. My husband asked me if I was willing to go and I said yes.\n\nMy MIL got 2 rooms ready. My husbands room for him and another room for me and the baby. Josh asked why and my MIL said \"well you have to get up early tomorrow and the baby won't let you sleep\". My husband said that it was not needed and we would sleep together like always. In the evening me and Josh went to bathe Sarah MIL said that it was inappropriate for Josh to bathe Sarah because she is a girl.  While having dinner Josh took Sarah from me so I could eat and BIL complimented on how helpful Josh was. Then the wife of BIL commented \"usually moms do this whatever\". (SIL doesn't like me cause I have never been like them while SIL and BIL still live with MIL and FIL).\n\nFinally we went to bed and Sarah woke up in the middle of the night. Josh woke up and said he'd take care of her. A few minutes later MIL and SIL stormed in to my room and said \"Wake up Sarah is crying\" I said \"josh is taking care of her\" and she said \"aren't you the mother? Josh has a meeting in the morning\". Then Josh came in the room with Sarah asleep and he told MIL and SIL to leave.\n\nWhen we woke up at 7am Sarah was gone. Me and Josh ran downstairs and MIL had taken Sarah to the garden. I ran in tears and got my baby and MIL said \"well all you do is sleep\". Josh told MIL she should have let us know even if it was just with a note. At the breakfast table MIL and SIL both commented on how I let my husband do everything. I snapped and said \"well I didn't make this baby alone. The father is right here and parenting is done by both parents. If needed he will be sleepless he will feed her bathe her and dress her. Josh doesn't mind helping out so why is it any of your concern? You should ask yourselves what you were doing in the room of a married man without even knocking the door instead of commenting on how bad of a mom I am. I told SIL \"if you know it so much better go f\\*cking make your own child\" Keep your noses out of my marriage and mind your own goddamn business. \n\nI left the table and Josh came with me and told me to pack my bag and we would go to our home. We have 2 workers in our home who live with us. Josh brought me home went to the meeting and came back. He even apologized for taking me there when he knew his mom. My phone has been blowing up with YTA messages from people. Husband, SIL (husband's bio sister), BIL and my family are on my side. FIL doesn't pick sides and SIL, MIL and their religious old school friends/ family are blowing my phone up.

You and your husband have a marriage (and a style of parenting) that works for the two of you wherein the responsibilities are much more balanced than how he was raised.  Nothing about it is any of your MIL's or SIL's business.", "NTA - it's good that your husband has your back in this.  I think it's time for some boundaries with his family, I'm guessing he'll be on board with this.  Let him deal with his mother and SIL, you focus on your family - you, your husband, and your daughter.", "Josh is a keeper, and frankly,  it's a miracle he turned out so normal.

Be cordial to them but try and avoid them whan possible. They are another group of religeous people that try and push their crazy beliefs on others when they should just practice their own crazy dogma and leave others alone. When having to comunicate with them be polite and if they push your buttons, ignore and remove yourself from their fun and games. You are better than to let them get you all upset, be smarter than them. Keep your head held high.", "Definitely NTA.", "No. NTA. This family is full of lunatics. The end.", "NTA. They sound awful.", "NTA his family sounds like a cult", "NTA, Cut them all off now. It is only going to get worse!!!!!", "NTA.", "NTA. But the way I read this is that they are deliberately fucking with you. Take your time and deal with their actions accordingly, but only after you and your husband are on the same page. Good luck.", "NTA!!  And great to hear your husband is standing up for you!!!", "NTA.  Marriage and parenthood are team efforts.  You and Josh should do what works best for you and your li'l family.  MIL and SIL seem atrocious!", "NTA but I always read these stories about people *sending* other people to harass a person when they have a problem.\n\nIf some numbnut that I didnt know dared to send me a message about my personal matters I ring him up and tear him a new one, is that an american thing ?", "NTA.... Good on you and your husband for voicing your opinions and for him being so visibly supportive in the house of his family.\n\nA strong marriage has TWO participants, it's nice if others are supportive... But I've never seen the over-involvement of others turn out well.", "Or showing this entire separate way of doing things threatens their deep rooted belief that theirs is the best way. Some people do anything to prove to themselves that they are not wrong.", "I wouldnt say exactly jealous but more angry and sad and frustrated. Here they are, fulfilling all duties they think they need to fulfill, adhering to (their own) female standards of suffering, protecting the male from all of that and \"sacrificing\" themselves and having male persons who expect that from them, and then OP comes around and actually has a helping husband and gets to rest a bit and take turns cartering to the baby, as it should be, not being a single mom to a baby and an adult men. That makes all their work unnecessary, questions all their identity of a sacrificing female person and they realise OP is no less of a woman and leads an \"easier\" life without getting \"punished\" for it, its possible. That probably challenges their whole world view of gender roles and their own identities.", "We live in a very big city. They live on one end we on the other it is a 1hr drive without traffic. I don't see them much anyway. Josh sees his brother and dad at work almost every day but I do like FIL and BIL they are not judgmental lol. I love Josh and he knows that I am not comfortable around MIL and SIL which is why he always asks me if I want to visit or not before saying yes or no to them. They are gonna extend the company and Josh is considering taking over the other building which is close to our home and that way he is and closer to us and he doesn't have to be in uncomfortable situations like these lol", "We all are but me and husband aren't practicing. We drink alcohol for example and I was raised really free by my parents. I always was allowed to wear whatever I wanted go where I wanted and have fun. My husband accepted me the way I am and he and I are very much the same. Even though he was raised differently we are still the same when it comes to having fun drinking alcohol etc. My husband does go to the mosque to pray on special days and he participates with ramadan. I however don't but I would wake up and make him sahuur every night for example. Wouldn't put alcohol on the table during ramadan and we respect each other the way we are.", "Actually, such behavior is not always related to religion, but to mindset.\n\nSometimes its like something related to the culture or environment such people live in. Like in some eastern asian non-religious families there are real traditional patriarchatical view on the gender roles in marriage.\n\nOr there are such examples in some western non-religious families, even in usa, where somehow it is expected for women to become a SAHM when they give birth to the children without any concern whether wife wants it or not. \n\nIn these 2 examples the main reason is not a religion, but some \"traditional\" view on gender roles. And its not always directed to the women, but sometimes men also. Like, frown upon a paternal leave from work to take care of newborn children, because its financially more advantagious for the family budget. Or when men are demanded to have higher salaries than their partners.\n\nIn overall, its messed up.", "What does that has to do with being Muslim\ud83d\ude02", "That's sweet, it's good you have such a relationship with your husband", "It is, she said 'they are religious' and their whole attitude refers to Muslim, which OP told me that they are Muslims indeed", "I just replied to the comment above to give them an idea of our lifestyle and the differences between my husband's family and us. Also I did mention me and my husband aren't practicing muslim if you are referring to us being bad muslim idk", "Muslims usually live together", "If you\u2019re not practicing that means you\u2019re not Muslim. But I was referring to her behaviour towards you guys. That has nothing to do with being Muslim or not."]}
