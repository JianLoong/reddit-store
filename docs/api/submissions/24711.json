I do agree with your conclusion about whether labels are visible, it is usually a difference between having wealth, or having lots of money. IMO...\n\nWealth doesn't display itself through clothing because it's assumed that a garment that is tailored and well made came from somewhere other than an outlet store. As much as it annoys me the quality is superior, and often obviously so. Wealth recognizes wealth and they aren't concerned with how non-wealthy people see them.\n\nPeople with enough money for luxury items but aren't wealthy have different motivations for what their clothing displays. It feels good to be set apart from the crowd, special and successful enough to have a LV bag, because we're all brainwashed (myself totally included) that it adds value to our very selves. But that doesn't work if nobody sees the item that denotes you are special - the logo has to be obvious, or really, there isn't a point.\n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with your sister's desire to feel that way. Mock all you want, but those of us with time for reddit ALL have our favorite ways of setting ourselves apart. And yes they're all stupid.

You're justifying it and rewriting the narrative a little, I'm guessing.\n\nI'd apologize. Some more. I'd say I never meant to make her feel any less important or worthy as your girlfriend's family.
