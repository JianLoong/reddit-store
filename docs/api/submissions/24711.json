I do agree with your conclusion about whether labels are visible, it is usually a difference between having wealth, or having lots of money. IMO...\n\nWealth doesn't display itself through clothing because it's assumed that a garment that is tailored and well made came from somewhere other than an outlet store. As much as it annoys me the quality is superior, and often obviously so. Wealth recognizes wealth and they aren't concerned with how non-wealthy people see them.\n\nPeople with enough money for luxury items but aren't wealthy have different motivations for what their clothing displays. It feels good to be set apart from the crowd, special and successful enough to have a LV bag, because we're all brainwashed (myself totally included) that it adds value to our very selves. But that doesn't work if nobody sees the item that denotes you are special - the logo has to be obvious, or really, there isn't a point.\n\nI don't think there is anything wrong with your sister's desire to feel that way.

And the \"fuck you\" rich people you come across will probably look down on you... not because you don't have that kind of money but that you care and are trying so hard to look like you do.\n\nI also understand that none of this matters. What anyone spends on their clothes is actually no one's business.\n\nMy parents are immigrants and struggled hard while we were growing up and are quite comfortable now. My mom gifted me a Coach handbag with a HUGE brass logo on it (at least 6\" across) I'm not shitting on my mom for being crass. I know that she got this at the coach outlet at extreme markdown and final sale, and she also understands that coach is a high quality brand. It's also a beautiful bag on its own, the perfect size and color and the leather is so soft and nice. I use it for her benefit sometimes but I try to wear it with the logo inward-facing or under a draped sweater. I know I shouldn't care but stresses me out a little to think it looks like I'm putting on airs. It really isn't my style to carry a flashy logo bag.", "It\u2019s called stealth wealth. Truly affluent people don\u2019t need to advertise their wealth. If there are logos, they ar small and discreet. But usually there are No Logos.", ">my sister spent months saving up for her bag and now she thinks it\u2019s tacky\n\n**Cough**itistacky**cough**", "I don't like things that are obviously branded either. 'Oh look I can afford xyz' Plys, why am I paying YOU to advertise your stuff?", "My fianc\u00e9 comes from generational wealth & I\u2019ve been around a lot of people with money ,I\u2019ve never seen them have something with flashy logos. \n\nIt might have like a charm of the brand or an indented monogram but you would never know what brand unless you really know about designer brands. \n\nThough I do agree that buying simple things like jackets or t shirts,belts from brands is pretty stupid. The day I learned my partner spent $400 on a BELT! I wanted to ch0ke him with the belt\u2026 cause why?! You can buy the exact same one on Amazon for $20!", "Having studied my previous Masters degree in this bizarre industry, I\u2019d say your observation is pretty accurate, at least with wealthy people in the western world. \n\nThere tends to be a noticeable difference between old money and new money wealth and how it\u2019s spent, which is a weirdly interesting and a bizarre thing to study in class. Like we had an old lecturer who was well connected in the world of luxury brands and he made it very clear on that brands like LV and Rolex aren\u2019t considered \u201creal\u201d luxury to them, they\u2019re called mass market luxury because of the noticeable use of logos and more affordable price point comparatively. He also frequently called LV, \u201csecretary bags\u201d, which was awkward for two or three people in our class who wore theirs that day though he\u2019s the type of rich that just doesn\u2019t care but I digress. \n\nSo I\u2019d say NTA, I don\u2019t think you meant any harm, honestly, it awesome that she saved up and was able to reward herself, but talk to her and remind her that\u2019s something to be proud of and you didn\u2019t mean it to be insulting, if she likes the bag that\u2019s what\u2019s most important, it shouldn\u2019t matter what other people think.", "So your sister spent months saving up for an ugly bag that 90% of the people who see it are going to think it's fake. Smart move. You can actually look this up though, 90% of all LV bags out in the public are fake... That means 90% of the people carrying them are carrying fakes and are going to assume that everybody else is too. Lol \n\nBut you're right, and I just mentioned this in another thread....Have you ever seen what Simon Cowell wears? Even on his own TV show that makes him millions of dollars he wears a Hanes t-shirt almost every day. That man probably has more money than every single one of us on this thread combined.

Your sister makes a comment about the label and you call her \"catty\".

I don't know if your sister was being \"catty\" or not, but let's not mince words here. You were absolutely criticizing her. \n\nSo, yes, YTA.

Can say that this is true.  Not wealthy at all, the family is solidly middle-class, mom is a teacher dad is an adjuster. I have a learning disability, and when I was diagnosed in the 80's you would have to get 2 grade levels behind before the public school would even step in to help.  So my parents asked moms parents for money to put me in a private school.  There were 2 in the area one Old Money and the other New Money.  New Money was more expensive Old Money was a little cheaper but had better LD classes, New Money School also would not accept me cause they had \"certain standards\" to uphold.  \n\nSo Mom went out and bought me new nicer clothes cause my stuff was not up to snuff and she thought I would be out of place with these kids. The Old Money kids were great people nice and welcoming but every single one had on old ripped clothes, no new fashion (for that time period) like I did. Dad saw what they were wearing when picked me up and told my Mom to take all my new stuff back and let me wear my normal stiff. Nobody had logo clothes but everything was name brand but worn to it being comfortable.    \n\nAt one time we had a Russian language teacher from the USSR, she took photos of us and sent them to her sister in the USSR who showed them to her class of students (kids around our age) they thought we were poor Americas and raised $100 to send to us.  It took the Russian teacher 3 months of letters to explain to her sister we were actually from very wealthy families.", "Nta and you were right", "Of the few wealthy women I know that do go for the LV bags, they tend to have many of them and use them indiscriminately for whatever occasion.

It's fine to wear ostentatious outfits but, when they are that way due to logos, it's d\u00e9class\u00e9.", "Not missing letters!!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", ">That doesn't really answer my question\n\nSure it does.\n\nHis little sister genuinely didn't see why anyone would buy a piece of designer clothing if it's not heavily branded.  He was teaching her that some people who purchase designer clothing are purchasing it for the quality.  He was also teaching her a little something about taste.  It's not his fault that the lesson stung.", "\u2026and that is the very definition of \u201chaving style\u201d \ud83d\udc4d", "Yup!  If it makes my DH's eyes glaze over with lust, I know it's a winner!", "Tacky people", "Maybe you're upper middle-class", "Shut the front door!! I love it!", "I think they were calling LV bags in general \u201csecretary bags,\u201d not any specific design since as far as luxury brands go, LV is high end but not *super* high end. Like, there\u2019s a lot of middle class people with LVs. Whereas I doubt many who aren\u2019t super wealthy have say, an Herm\u00e8s Birkin.", "But they weren\u2019t even real. Just why spend money on fake clothes just so we can see the logos. \nI love North Face coats actually. I live near the Alps and they are amazing. I got one second hand and it works like a charm in the winter. Just back home I can\u2019t say it\u2019s second hand cause that\u2019s a crime apparently", "It's likely she was taking a dig but I'd rather confirm that. I do think it's possible that someone could have a harder time seeing the point of something expensive if it doesn't have the visible status to go along with it. \n\nI consider her the bigger AH because he made a dig that was pretty in kind to what she gave. And she started it. She escalated way higher than I think is warranted by calling him a gold digger.", "Oooh I'm blushing! \u263a", "> Just back home I can\u2019t say it\u2019s second hand cause that\u2019s a crime apparently\n\nLOL, that's ridiculous.  Patagonia actually has a program where they buy back vintage items they made, recondition them, and resell.", "Agreed. If I want a nicer purse I\u2019ll go Coach outlet style without the logo plastered all over. Just give me simple clean leather please."]}
