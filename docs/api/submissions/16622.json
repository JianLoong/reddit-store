Thank you all for the comments, it seems the majority think I am NTA.  But to answer a few questions:\nYes she did have a role in the wedding, she signed the witness book, walked down the aisle first with the flower girls as they were young and scared to go down alone. I said she could do a speech as well if she wanted but she declined.  There were other things too. \n\nYes the wedding is over and she didn\u2019t end up wearing a white or ivory dress, her dress was white with red flowers with a bright red hat and I just decided to pick my battles. \n\nFinally for the person who said that I am dragging this up after the wedding is over and IATA for not letting it go, she keeps bringing it up saying I was a bridezilla for not letting her choose her outfit and that I wanted all the attention on me.  It had me doubting myself as my sister also agreed with her. None of my other friends and family thing I was a bridezilla and all said they had a smashing time at the wedding.  The day was about my husband and I, I do not crave the spotlight at all.
