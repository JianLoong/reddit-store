She's not a selfish cow like her mother.  You sit and color with her and her new coloring books and crayons and tuck her into bed with her new stuffed animal.\n\nYou did good, uncle.  You are adulting just fine.  NTA.\n\nETA:  Niece's mom, OP's sister, is not the obnoxious aunt in this situation.  The misunderstanding is entirely mine.", "NTA\n\nAunt is a very rude AH. Your gift was fine. Let your family know what she said (but don't imply you're asking them for money). They may be able to have a direct talk with your aunt about being an AH.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt needs to learn some manners. The only AH here is aunty.", "NTA, I\u2019m genuinely confused by this. Why would you ask family to give you money for her gifts?!\n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s time thing else at play, like she thinks your parents should be spending more on her daughter\u2019s kids or she gave her daughter money to spend on a different niece\u2019s kid.", "NTA.\n\nAre your family usually this materialistic? The point of a birthday party is to gather family and celebrate, not to compete and out-gift each other.\n\nIn my family, just one gift is enough but you actually got your niece THREE gifts and that's still not enough?", "NTA, your aunt sure is though. Gift giving is supposed to be at the discretion of the giver. It is extremely rude to demand better gifts from anyone. No one should have to put themselves into debt to give a gift. What should have happened was a \u201cThank You\u201d. So, since she won't do it, I will. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule and very tight budget to go and pick out some coloring books and crayons for your niece.", "NTA. Your aunt is shallow and delusional. The kid is 2. What did she expect? A playstation? Give me a break.", "NTA - your aunt is an inconsiderate AH. She has no idea how much rent and college cost. If you did the break down for her she would still ignore it. She just wanted to feel superior. I\u2019d go extremely low contact and if she bothers to notice, demand an apology. She was basically bullying you, I know she\u2019s family, but confronting her and standing up for yourself is how you handle bullies.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt sucks. You spent $30 on a two year old! That's plenty! I bet what you got was appropriate for her age and she will enjoy playing with. $30 is plenty when you are only 21 years old and are having to be careful with money due to studying and working. I would take a step back from this aunt. It's disgusting that she expects a lot of money being spent on her two year old in the first place, let alone from someone who just doesn't have much to spend despite working and studying as much as you do!", "What?!  NTA. \n\nFirst, that\u2019s just tacky of your aunt even if you\u2019re a quadrillionaire. You don\u2019t say that stuff to people. Second, you are a 21 year old college student so obviously you can\u2019t just drop a ton of money on stuff like this. \n\nYour aunt is way out of line. You did great.", "NTA.. Your aunt is, though. It's not about how much you spend, but the thought that goes into it. At your niece's age, those were perfectly nice gifts. \n\nNext present get her the loudest, most obnoxious toy you can find, that goes off at the slightest touch and doesn't turn off. How do you like me now, auntie!! Hehehee", "NTA. $30 is a fine budget. I\u2019m over 40 and $30-ish is still my budget for nieces and nephews. \n\nYour aunt needs to mind her own business.", "NTA.\nHowever, your aunt is captain of the AH Team.\n\nYou\u2019re self supporting on 30 hours a week, so she ought to be glad you got your niece got anything at all.", "NTA   the child is two.  They think wrapping paper is fun\n\nYour aunt is an asshole.  Tell her to bugger off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My own niece is 3 and she gets excited when I just video chat her. She\u2019d be thrilled for some coloring books (I got her a paint set once and she tore that up literally and figuratively lol)", "NTA. Your aunt is an AH for saying anything about the gift. Your niece is 2, and won\u2019t remember what you gave her. Your aunt needs to mind her own business.", "When my niece was 2 you know what she played with - the empty boxes her larger gifts came In. We joked and said we all should have just wrapped employ boxes. She\u2019s 2 - she doesn\u2019t care how expensive something is. You are definitely NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour aunt is a major AH. 2 year olds love all the stuff you got your niece. It's not your aunt's place to make you feel like garbage. You did your absolute best. At 2, all your niece cares about is toys, doesn't really matter what they are or the cost. I'm sure your niece is thrilled with what you got.", "NTA- tell your aunt to mind her business. This kid is 2 and likely would prefer playing with a can of soup and an empty box anyway. It is always the thought that counts, you did the best you could. I'm annoyed for you, cool gifts are wasted on a 2-year old. When that kid hits 9-10 you can swoop in and be the cool uncle taking her cool places and helping her solve life's problems. Those are the things that will matter.", "NTA. Your aunt is the asshole. You got what you could.", "NTA. Personally nibblings under 5 get a gift under $20. 5-13 get $30, usually some sort of small gift around $10-15 and $10-15 cash. 13 and up get $40, usually a gift card for $20 and $20 cash. A 2 year old isn\u2019t going to care how much you spent & a 21 year old shouldn\u2019t have to be breaking the bank for a kid that isn\u2019t theirs. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll absolutely love the coloring books and crayons.", "NTA You got exactly what a 2-year-old would love.  Tell your aunt to kindly mind her own business unless she is going to pay your bills, she has no say in how much you spend on a 2 year old's gift.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure your niece loved the present.  \nNot much point spending more on a 2 y/o", "NTA. One year during the 2008 recession  while husband and I were both working and students we were so broke we did a cute pic of my kids and a wrapped baggie of candy from the dollar store because that\u2019s all we could afford. I could tell my SIL was pissed but I could care less. You give what you can and don\u2019t worry about it. Next time give her nothing and when she asks tell her well I have nothing up to her standards so I have nothing so she won\u2019t be disappointed.", "News flash, your aunt sucks. I bet the kid loved it. You post reminds me of when I was growing up. My family was kind of wealthy and my mom would buy me fancy toys. However, I never was really into the over priced crap she got me. I always seemed to prefer the cheap stuff my nanny got me. The amount you spend on a gift is irrelavent. It's the thought you put into it for the person. To illustrate this, My mom for my 15th birthday got me an expensive set of golf clubs... I didn't play golf. In summation, I'm qualified to tell you the price of a gift is irrealavant. Also, not everyone is rich enough to go to F.A.O. Schwratz. I don't know if that is still a thing anywhere anymore. NY?", "NTA\n\nYour Aunt is commenting on things that are absolutely none of her business. She is a vile old bag and if she really had to say something, should have been thanking you for an awesome and age appropriate gift for your niece.", "NTA. But why are you making student loan payments when you're still in school? Aren't they deferred until you graduate (or drop out)?", "Her mother wasn't the one who said this. It was our aunt (my niece's great aunt). My sister (her mom) was actually very understanding", "I pay my interest every month (around $300). Probably should've been more clear.", "Ah, my mistake.  Your aunt can go sit in the timeout corner.", "You should now ask that Aunt for cash. Like once a month..", "Pfff, f her!", "\"Sure, Aunt, I'd love to spend more on gifts, so how much do you want to give me so I can do that? $1000 sounds like a good start, what do you think?\"\n\nYour niece will care much more about whether you sit with her and help her enjoy her gifts.", "That's what I was going to say.  If aunt doesn't like the  presents she can give op the money to buy them", "Ooooo, this is a great idea. And when she complains remind her that she was one who told you to ask family for money.", "Exactly!!! Just ask her for $50 each time that niece has a birthday. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to be the reason the niece is disappointed by cheap gifts, are you? You must not think much of her.\u201d", "Every family gift giving occasion."]}
