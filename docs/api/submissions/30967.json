I was diagnosed at seven years old, and after that, my family always treated me like I was several years younger than I was. I was deemed incapable of looking after myself, never allowed to walk or take the bus to school or go out on my own (to the shopping centre, for example) without my parents in the same building. My mother in particular insisted on singing a lullaby to me every night for eleven years. \n\nI moved out as soon as I hit 18, and had to miss out on the chance to go to university so that I could work full time to support myself (most of my family, including my parents, cut me off for being \"ungrateful). I have been in therapy to help me process these issues, but they are very deep-seated.\nI met my girlfriend (F24) two years ago at the local library. She asked for my number and we hit it off right away. I have told her about my issues, but not in great depth.\n\nThree weeks ago, the lease on her apartment was up and we decided to rent a place together. We went half on everything, the deposit, the utilities and the rent. We also share a bed. I get up for work at 8 AM every week day, because my boss supports me in my newd for routine so my shifts always start at the same time. My girlfriend has odd shifts, and can wake up between 5:30 and 9 AM. I have no issue with this, I would just roll over and go back to sleep, but her alarm tone is what I don't like.\n\nIt's a lullaby. Not the same one my mother sang, but it makes me uncomfortable with how similar it is. Four times so far, her alarm has gone off before mine, and I couldn't go back to sleep because I was emotionally upset. Yesterday, I had a meltdown after she left the house, and had to call off \n work. \n\nThis evening, when I was calmer and she hadn't had a day of work that would maybe make her too tired for an important conversation, I brought up that I'd her to change her alarm tone, because it makes me feel infantilised again. She sighed, and said that she liked it because it was the same song as her grandma's music box and woke her up gently. I tried to explain why I disliked it so much, but I was rapidly losing my composure. I stuttered for a bit, then she got angry and told me \"If you don't want to feel infantilised you should man up\" (I am nonbinary, but assigned male at birth) \"and get over it, it's just an alarm. Grow up.\"\n\nShe went to stay with her mother for the night. I still love her, and don't want to break up, but I told my sister who I still have contact with, and she said it was a stupid thing to fight over, and I should have just left it alone.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit 1: She plays this music at other times too, sometimes in the evening, and I have no issue, if I'm uncomfortable I can go to a different room. It's just in the mornings as soon as I wake up, when i can't emotionally regulate as well.", "created_utc": 1699954388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uyov5/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_change_her_alarm/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a part of her routine for as long as she\u2019s needed it. \n\nShe has fond memories of lullabies. It makes waking up easier for her, and her sleep schedule is irregular so it\u2019s already more difficult for her to wake up at different times. \n\nAnd what if you have kids in the future? Will you ban all lullabies from your household forever? You will not allow your kids to be sung to sleep by any lullaby simply because you have bad associations with 1 singular song? \n\nNo one should \u201cman up\u201d or subscribe to sexist terms. But yes you\u2019re wrong for banning an entire genre of music from being played by your girlfriend simply because you have bad associations with 1 singular song of that genre.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same song, it\u2019s just the same genre of music. You have to learn that one song is not representative of an entire genre and that other people can have positive associations with a genre you\u2019ve had a bad experience with.", "INFO:\n\n* Did you actually explain to her what happened after she left, that this was not simply a case of *feeling* infantilised but that it actually triggered for you to the point you had a meltdown and left unable to work for the day?\n\nBecause if you didn't, it is possible all she's heard is you find it upsetting and want her to stop with something that she finds comforting. \n\nYou've said that you told her about your issues didn't go into great depth. So it is more than possible that she doesn't understand how disturbing this is to you.  \n\n* Have you actually asked how long she's had this as an alarm tone?\n\nFor all we know, she's woken up to this tune for years. It could be a habit as well as a comfort to her. \n\n* Have you been addressing the triggering nature of the type of music with your therapist?\n* If you've not already discussed addressing it with your therapist, will you now?\n\nLook, I have an issue with the terminology she used when she told you to \"man up\" but you need to appreciate that lullabies will be something you will encounter in future, in shops, in clips of certain tv shows, in friends' houses, possible in your own home if you have kids in future. You need to work on addressing it to minimise the impact on your future, whether your future is with this girlfriend or not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I don't see the issue in you asking. The issue is if you are demanding, not considering alternatives and/or not hearing her. If you didn't properly explain it to her, that you would have come across as an AH to her. \n\nAnd like I said, I have an issue with her terminology \"man up\" and her response as a whole. You said she was angry when she said this - well, you're going to have to work out whether in her anger she revealed a little red flag of her real feelings, or if in her anger she misspoke/chose the wrong words to relay how she really feels. The whole grow-up-and-get-over-it idea isn't good, but if you've minimised with her the extent of what you went through then she may well be thinking you are making a mountain out of a molehill.", "YTA. I'm sorry but your issues with lullabies are exactly that, your issue. It's not even that your issue is with a single lullaby but all lullabies. It maybe fair to ask her to change her alarm temporarily while you sort this out through therapy or other means, but not permanently. Your girlfriend's alarm has sentimental meaning to her.\n\nAlso, if you admit you can barely keep your composure in a conversation about a lullaby alarm then that's just more reason to deal with your trauma. This seems to be really triggering for you so I wish you the best in working this out.", "YTA. This is a YOU problem. If the lullaby bothers you, then discuss it in therapy and work on it. She should not have to change something that helps her because you don't like it. She doesn't need to change anything. You were way too demanding and unreasonable.", "NAH. But I think you should address this in therapy. If every single lullaby is going to trigger you this extremely you need to solve that because there\u2019s going to be so many instances where you\u2019ll accidentally hear a lullaby. Have you tried EMDR?", "\u201cI have told her about my issues, but not in great depth.\u201d This is where the solution lies. If you tell her the core of the problem, and the fact that it only bothers you in the mornings, you two might be able to find a solution. Also, keep working with your therapist on realizing this one song is indeed different from the one your mom sang to you, like Calm_Brick_6608 so eloquently explained. NAH.", "Aside from all the other comments, I just want to say that the whole 'man up' comment makes your partner an AH. Next to keeping up the whole 'tough masculinity' trope, saying such a thing to someone that is already having difficulties with not feeling true to one's AMAB gender is a major AH move.\n\nI hope you don't feel like you have to man up- your emotions and triggers are valid and working through them is a slow and sensitive process. It sounds like your partner doesn't seem to understand the severity of your trauma's and doesn't care much to seek a middle ground. \n\nI'm proud of you for moving out and choosing yourself first even though you get so much extra emotional trouble for it. I hope you know keeping guard over your triggers and communicating your needs and when something becomes to much is completely fine and healthy. Healing is more important than new relationships, and if your partner is not on that same page, it might be better to move on.\n\nEdit: Removed 'too' after 'makes your partner an AH' because I think your NTA here.", "I think you've gotten pretty solid advice on this so far, but I'd just add that it's important to recognize when you're losing your composure and to call a pause before it goes further downhill.  Some conversations require a second cup of tea.", "NTA for asking. But this whole thing went down pretty badly. \n\nI understand you got upset, which is why you had trouble verbalising your issue clearly. It happens to us all sometimes. She went above and beyond a civil conversation with what she said and how she has behaved. No one needs to 'man up'. Men have feelings too and you have very negative ones attached to this sort of noise. \n\nIn saying that, she does not have to change it because it brings her good memories. Idk if a compromise can be made somehow.", "NTA. I've been in a relationship for almost 20 years, and wow what the heck is with these responses? If my SO started having hypervigilance because of my morning alarm, I would simply change it because I care about them. They would do the same for me.\n\nIt does seem like there are some conflicting access needs here because the gf needs an alarm that wakes her up gradually. Well, so does OP. So idk what the rest of y'all are so angry about, it seems reasonable to discuss a mutual compromise that everyone can agree to.\n\nMy SO and I actually ran into a similar issue with what music to fall asleep to. I prefer podcasts, they prefer listening to the same song on repeat forever. We figured out the Enya Pandora station works for both of us. This is just life when you choose to share it with another person.\n\nOP, it sounds like talking this out with your mouth words might be difficult. It might be helpful to write down what you are trying to communicate. You said your gf doesn't know all the details about what you experienced. I'm hoping that (unacceptable name calling aside), she maybe just didn't understand how this impacts you. For example, if you started with the title of this post \"this alarm makes me feel infantilized\" and then lost words. ..I could definitely understand her response being to perceived toxic gender norms. My hope is that she's not so attached to an alarm that she's ok with sending you into a PTSD spiral. If she is, then you have bigger problems and it's probably good to find out now.", "NTA. You tried to talk to her reasonably and she lashed out in a way she knew would hurt you in a very personal manner.\n\nThis right here:\n\n>I stuttered for a bit, then she got angry and told me \"If you don't want to feel infantilised you should man up\" (I am nonbinary, but assigned male at birth) \"and get over it, it's just an alarm. Grow up.\"\n\nYeah, that's a ***huge*** red flag, get the fuck out of this relationship.", "Sleep in earplugs, so you don't hear her alarm, just your own. \n\nNAH.", "Info: when you say you rapidly lost your composure, what did that look like? Were you being rude or name calling? What your partner did in saying \"man up\" is a substantial red flag, I'm just wondering if the heat was matched on both sides.", "The comments on this post are so rancid holy shit. If OP had a boyfriend everyone would say boyfriend is an asshole and he clearly does not care for OP's emotional needs.\n\nChanging your alarm in order to not cause your LOVED ONE distress is such a small simple thing, I would not think twice before doing it and I feel sorry for all potential partners and friends of the people commenting on this post. You sound like shitty people to be around.\n\nOP, your girlfriend sound not only like a selfish person, but she does not respect you. You don't talk to someone you love like this then leave. I know you are attached and breaking up is very hard since you're living together but it might be the best scenario for you. If she is not willing to understand you and try and HELP instead of dismiss your feelings (resulting from fucking trauma, which you can't help) she is not the kind of person you want to spend your life with.\n\nI hope you have close friends that do care about you and that will support you and tell you how this behaviour is horrible, unlike your sister. God, I can't imagine someone behaving to my little sister the way your girlfriend did and then me blaming HER for it", "NTA\n\nIf you're both in bed and you both have to hear it, it's not *her* alarm.  It's an alarm that is notifying both of you, she just happens to be the one setting it.   \n\nYou're in the same bedroom, certain things must be agreed upon. door open or closed?   fan?  heavy or light blankets?  perfect darkness or little light?  noise, including any music either wants to play in bed.  That last one is where you're at.  Setting an alarm is setting music to play.  If your girl doesn't like crunk, don't play that in the bedroom forcing it on her.

Soft ESH. This reads as an immature argument over a non-issue. \n\nThe lullaby is triggering for you and you need to deal with it. Should she have been more compassionate? Absolutely. Does she need to understand more about autism? 100%. Is it actually her problem? Not really. \n\nWhen I had a miscarriage, all I saw everywhere were babies. My friends were all announcing their bundles of joy and the whole thing was very triggering for me. I had to sit down and deal with them. I got upset. That\u2019s okay! \n\nOne of the things I\u2019m most grateful to my parents for is their attitude of \u2018the world isn\u2019t going to change so you need to deal with it\u2019 towards my disabilities and autism. It\u2019s harsh but ultimately, realistic. You get the disability aids. You rearrange your schedule. You make a plan for when you\u2019re overwhelmed and you get on with it. \n\nAs harsh as my post may sound, I truly wish you the best of luck! You are doing wonderfully well to be independent at such a young age and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get there with your girlfriend :3", "Leaning to NTA.\n\nThis is a difficult one because I firmly believe that when it comes to triggers, we are definitely in charge of how we deal with them ourselves. They show us something that we need to work on **but not** use to control other people's actions. It seems as though you are working through said issues with a therapist, however, which is fantastic - keep going, proud of you.\n\nI think working on your ability to remain composed when discussing your feelings and why they're raw is important here. Approaching with kindness always wins.\n\n**BUT**\n\nit is unacceptable for her to use your NB/Gender.  I would say this is a massive red flag that when there's a disagreement, she may resort to very personal attacks that have the propensity to destroy the relationship instantly.\n\nShe's the AH.", "NTA. This is beyond simple 'bad associations'. The mistreatment and trauma you endured probably does rise to the level of C-PTSD, and lullabies are a trigger for you.\n\nIf you don't have a therapist, and you can afford it, I think you should get one. If you do have a therapist, it might be a good idea to have them explain to your girlfriend how CPTSD, triggers, trauma, etc. work and how that's related here. Alternatively, write a letter to your girlfriend so that you dont have to explain things on the spot and you can get your thoughts out more coherently.\n\nLastly, if it's \"just an alarm clock\", why is it such a big deal for *her* to change it? The negative effect for her of having a different alarm tone would be a lot less than the negative effect her current alarm is having on you. You literally had a meltdown and had to call off work because of it.", "Wow I\u2019m surprised at some of these comments.\n\nI would never want to make my partner feel uncomfortable or upset ever.\nIt\u2019s just an alarm tone and adults need to compromise in relationships.\n\nNTA but she is for that comment and running home to mummy at the first sign of conflict.", "ESH\n\nHer response was terrible, absolutely mean and uncalled for. Telling you to \"man up\" is unacceptable. \"Grow up\" is pretty crappy too. You said you don't want to break up over this but you really should consider it. \n\nHowever, I don't think you handled this well either. Have you asked her to change a lot of other things to appease your autism? That could be why she didn't react well. She could be feeling like this is one thing she has to wake up nicely but has to change her life AGAIN for you because you can't deal with something. \n\nLook, I get trauma and how weird and it is and the associations. But I am trying to wrap my mind around how your mother singing you a lullaby is that traumatic. Infantilizing people with disabilities is not okay but, unless there was other trauma like physically hurting you or other emotional abuse I can't see how you can't try to reframe this in your mind as your mother caring for you. The reasons she did it is crappy, but was the actual act of sing to you that bad? \n\nI have had some trauma that I had to reframe because it was really affecting my life. The more I thought about how I hate it, the more it bothered me, the more reactive I got when it happened. Reframing that, yes, it was bad for me, but it isn't for most people & essentially I needed to get over it really helped deescalate the situation for me. Now, it bothers me but usually not enough to say anything or effect my day at all.\n\nI understand it's hard work & I am really hoping you luck in the future.", "I'm autistic too, and I also sometimes have strong reactions to things that remind me of past traumas. \n\nYTA, though.\n\nShe would be infantalizing you if she made YOUR alarm a lullaby because she thinks you're acting immature. She is simply continuing a practice for herself that she has done for years. You want to deny her a comfort to make yourself more comfortable. If the mere sound of any lullaby makes you this upset, you need to get into some talk therapy. \n\nEarly morning meltdowns suck, and they make the rest of the day suck. But you can't ask your GF to deactivate a key part of her personality. Maybe you need to sleep in separate rooms until you can get the emotional disregulation under control.", "YTA. If it was the same lullaby I\u2019d be on your side but you\u2019re talking about an entire genre/area of music. \n\nBut beyond that you admit that your girlfriend doesn\u2019t know the depth of your issues. You don\u2019t have to spill your guts about everything on the first date but your behavior seems a bit unfair and dishonest. If I moved in with someone and found out their issues and expectations were far beyond what they presented and that they were so easily triggered I\u2019d be pissed. \n\nPart of healing and treatment is being aware of when you are and are not ready for a relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were ready for a serious live-in relationship in the first place.", "NTA?? Idk about y\u2019all but if I told my partner their alarm triggered me they'd change it like, yesterday. And I'd absolutely do the same for them. I also would never tell my NB partner to \u201cman up\u201d.\nHow can you say you love someone but still be unwilling to sacrifice something so small? For just a friend or stranger sure. But someone you may spend your life with?? No wonder no one can manage a relationship lmao. So needlessly selfish.", "She should not have used the phrase \u201cman up.\u201d   But she\u2019s right. You\u2019re basically saying you aren\u2019t mature enough to handle something infantilizing. Like, which is it?  Are you a child that needs to be catered to?  Or are you an adult who exists in the world and needs to own their own trauma response?", "NTA. Neurotypicals don't seem to get this, but you're waking up every single day to bad memories. Your girlfriend should not want to do that to you. This is a very easy accommodation for her to make that will make a large difference to you. You tried to explain that in an understanding and thoughtful way, and as we autistic folks often experience, your explanation was brushed off and you were infantilized again. She was an AH, but hopefully if you educate her more an your autism and your different needs she will be more accepting. \nI repeat: NTA. You can't change how your brain works, and a lifetime of trauma can't be brushed aside.", "I say YTA, the lullaby was not set to your phone and it isn\u2019t the same song, it\u2019s a different song. That\u2019s not infantilising you, if she\u2019d set YOUR phone with the alarm then THAT would be infantilising. To me stating that you having to hear an alarm that doesn\u2019t belong to you is infantilising you is the same as some people grossly mislabelling something as parentification or gaslighting when actually it\u2019s nothing of the sort.\n\nYou demanded to change something that she feels dearly about, again your words a song that is *not* the song your mother sang to you, but a different song *her* grandmother sang to her. I understand that autism is a spectrum and there are many ways to manage it but this is one you will have to manage by finding the disconnect between one song and another. Because my main thing here, again is the fact that it isn\u2019t the same song.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have been treated the way you had with your family but in order to make the relationship last you need to disconnect your hate for a song that you weren\u2019t sang to as a child. Best of luck", "I don't think you're TA, because you can't just switch off your reaction to this. But some people need to wake up a certain way. I have a hardcore dance track with a slow buildup, because I need it so start calmly and get more and more aggressive. I've tried just slower songs but I sleep through. I've tried hard music from the start but jolting me awake suddenly leaves me tired and moody all day. This works. And it sounds like being woken with a lullaby is the way your gf wakes up. You're going to have to find a way to deal with it to stay together. Or maybe consider separate rooms.", "In all fairness, soft YTA - she is right, and this is something you need to deal with instead of demanding that the world accommodate you. This is an unreasonable expectation, and it means something equally important to her. Whilst we do need some accommodations in order to be able to get through life, a diagnosis of autism is NOT a crutch to demand unreasonable things of people just because you don't want to unpick and learn to deal with some of your issues. It's a framework to allow you to better understand your limitations and build workarounds that suit your needs. By refusing to cope with this issue, you are actually infantilising *yourself*. Whilst I hate the term \"man up\", she's not entirely wrong in the general intention. This is something you have to come to terms with and she shouldn't have to bend on this.", "\nIt sounds like you have a bit of PTSD that is triggered by a certain type of music. If I were living with you, I would absolutely change my alarm to another type of music. In my mind, your extreme negative reaction would trump my lullaby haze. It's a no-brainer to me and a fairly easy compromise. I'm sorry your gf doesn't see it that way. It also sounds to me like she has empathy issues. A clear sign of that is that she actually got defensive and said, \"man up\" and \"grow up\" to you when you were trying to explain what was going on for you. Oy! The ability to compromise and empathize are both important factors in any healthy relationship so if you notice that your gf has issues with either as your relationship evolves, you may want to invite her into your therapy sessions. As far as the alarm goes, maybe wear ear plugs? Definitely talk about this whole scenario with your therapist, though. NTA", "YTA. This is a you problem. If you expect the world to tip toe around you then prepare for a life of disappointment. While I don't necessarily agree with the \"man up\" language I do agree with the \"grow up\" portion. Your whole point of this post is to complain about being treated like a child when you in fact act like a child. See a therapist and sort your life out.", "NTA. Sounds pretty reasonable and if she cares about you she would have at the very least addressed it in a kinder way. She sounds like a bit of an AH. Is this something that's ever come up before in your relationship? She may not really understand you very well which is unfortunate as you've just moved in together.\n\nYou may need to have a deeper conversation with her about your personal struggles and find out if she is willing to be understanding and patient or if she just isn't capable at this stage in her life.", "NTA Her reaction to something that would be a slight inconvenience to her but big accommodation for you is weird and over the top. Like what, partners should care about each other's comfort.", "YTA. You don't seem ready for a relationship, my dude. It's not even the same samn song! Get therapy and let her find a proper adult partner, not one who throws tantrums over an alarm.", "NTA\n\nIf it's a big deal to you then it is a big deal. That's how relationships work. She was TA for dismissing what you said. It's not that you dislike the song, it triggers you and you had a full meltdown because of it. No partner should want to trigger their loved one like that.\n\nThat you should eventually get over it, maybe? But that's not the point. The song upsets you to the point of disrrupting your day, she should see that and change the song while you figure your trauma out.", "YTA. \n\nI am autistic. Everything I\u2019m about to say should be heard with that being considered. \n\nThe world does not, and will never revolve around your triggers. There are reasonable accommodations and unreasonable ones. This is not an autism issue, this is not a reasonable accommodation. This is an issue with your childhood that can and should be worked through. Seek some help for your mental health issues regarding your childhood. Not everything is because of your autism. This is not an autistic issue. The issue is being made worse because of your autism, but the issue is not your autism. \n\nWhat you need to stop doing is infantilizing yourself. You do not get to ask people to change the things they like because it makes you uncomfortable. Your meltdown was because of unresolved childhood issues, not because of an inherent issue with your autism symptoms. You need to learn the difference. You are still responsible for your mental health even if you\u2019re autistic. There are things you can work through, and things you can\u2019t. This is something you can work through. \n\nDo not be *that* autistic that thinks they\u2019re entitled to a life with no discomfort. You still have to deal with uncomfortable feelings.

My husband spent money on a dinosaur ringtone and after 3 mornings of being startled awake I told him to change his alarm if he wanted to continue sleeping  in the same bed as me.

I dont have any advice on how to talk with your girlfriend, but I understand how you feel.", "NTA, your girlfriend really shouldn't have misgendered you, that super wasn't cool (unless you and she have already discussed what gendered terms you're okay with her using for you, which I hope you have).\n\nMy suggestion, other than making new memory associations with this specific song (play it while you're calm and alert and maybe having some good food, or watching a show you like - just something that you *like*, and be sure to stop the moment you're uncomfortable), will always be open and honest communication. However you can do so comfortably, over the phone, not looking at each other, etc., you need a real conversation about the issues you're having right now. Use \"I\" statements. Otherwise it's just problems on problems in the future.", "NTA, but not at all surprised that the top comment is calling you an asshole and defending your gf. This sub has a problem with being biased towards women. Guarantee you if a woman had posted this about how a man's alarm tone made her have a meltdown and missed work and when asked to change it said something sexist this sub would say he's the asshole. Since she's a women though she must have an infinite amount of reasons that make her being brushing you off and being sexist completely ok.", "NTA. \n\nI'm autistic as well and also have quite a bit of childhood trauma. I also live with someone who is not autistic and our routines have clashed against one another many times throughout our almost 8 year relationship. \n\nMy advice for you is this: talk to her in depth about your autism and how it affects you personally. Discuss your traumas and your triggers openly with her. Nobody else in the world has the exact same combination of traumas and triggers as you, so unless you talk to her there is no way she'll know. \n\nYou will find many clashing moments in the future living with someone else, whether they are also neurodivergent or not. The lullaby situation is just the first problem you've encountered that has revolved around your trauma. Make sure to open ways for honest communication as soon as possible with your partner. Check in often, discuss issues as soon as they happen, and be open and honest about your feelings and your mental health.\n\nAt the same time, make sure you're in touch with your therapist and discuss with them your relationship insecurities, questions, and miscommunications as often as you can. You will most likely need to learn how to deal with the parts of your partner that you do not like that much but are important to her, like the lullaby and how it reminds her of her grandma. \n\nIf the lullaby ends up staying, I would recommend you discuss this in length with your therapist to find out exactly why it triggers you so much and how you can work on it. I'm not a medical professional but EMDR has done wonders for my PTSD and my very vivid flashbacks. \n\nI would like to end by saying that if I were you, I would avoid coming to AITA in the future to discuss things that affect your mental health or your traumas. People can be cruel in these whereabouts and the last thing you want is someone putting you down without having the first clue about what being autistic feels. \n\nSending a virtual hug to you.", "NTA.

The issue is that if she really care about you, she should care that it upsets you so much. And I\u2019m especially concerned that she told you to man up.

Even without explaining the reason (which is very valid btw) that's something a loving partner should be prepared to just do for you. Her reaction to your request is weirdly strong and especially the 'man up' comment sounds very deliberately hurtful and over the top given the topic.

If she has to get up earlier, she uses a different alarm. You sleep in different beds if she has to get up earlier. Or maybe you could sit down with your girlfriend and see if you can form a different memory with her particular melody (during a different time of the day, of course). Ask her about her grandma, about the music box and all her happy memories there. Maybe find it on spotify and listen to it in an environment that seems to match the music and that you enjoy. Make it about appreciating your girlfriend's life and her story.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA, you were trying to tell her what was wrong and her reaction was uncalled for.

I was diagnosed at seven years old, and after that, my family always treated me like I was several years younger than I was. I was deemed incapable of looking after myself, never allowed to walk or take the bus to school or go out on my own (to the shopping centre, for example) without my parents in the same building. My mother in particular insisted on singing a lullaby to me every night for eleven years. \nI moved out as soon as I hit 18, and had to miss out on the chance to go to university so that I could work full time to support myself (most of my family, including my parents, cut me off for being \"ungrateful). I have been in therapy to help me process these issues, but they are very deep-seated.\nI met my girlfriend (F24) two years ago at the local library. She asked for my number and we hit it off right away. I have told her about my issues, but not in great depth.\nThree weeks ago, the lease on her apartment was up and we decided to rent a place together. We went half on everything, the deposit, the utilities and the rent. We also share a bed. I get up for work at 8 AM every week day, because my boss supports me in my newd for routine so my shifts always start at the same time. My girlfriend has odd shifts, and can wake up between 5:30 and 9 AM. I have no issue with this, I would just roll over and go back to sleep, but her alarm tone is what I don't like.\nIt's a lullaby. Not the same one my mother sang, but it makes me uncomfortable with how similar it is. Four times so far, her alarm has gone off before mine, and I couldn't go back to sleep because I was emotionally upset. Yesterday, I had a meltdown after she left the house, and had to call off \n work. \nThis evening, when I was calmer and she hadn't had a day of work that would maybe make her too tired for an important conversation, I brought up that I'd her to change her alarm tone, because it makes me feel infantilised again. She sighed, and said that she liked it because it was the same song as her grandma's music box and woke her up gently. I tried to explain why I disliked it so much, but I was rapidly losing my composure. I stuttered for a bit, then she got angry and told me \"If you don't want to feel infantilised you should man up\" (I am AMAB) \"and get over it, it's just an alarm. Grow up.\"\nShe went to stay with her mother for the night. I still love her, and don't want to break up, but I told my sister who I still have contact with, and she said it was a stupid thing to fight over, and I should have just left it alone.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Moreover, even if you'd already taken said decades of stutter specific therapy, it's entirely possible you'd still have stuttered there and then, because - again - stuttering isn't something people can control.  Getting it to happen less often doesn't mean that it can be prevented from happening in any specific instance.\n\nShe minimized your trauma, got angry over something outside your control, expressed disdain instead of compassion when you were losing composure, and managed to work in a call for you, non-binary, to get more in line with toxic masculinity while she was at it.

On top of that, a lot of autistics are more sensitive to stimuli and literally cannot just shut it out (because that is not how their neurodivergent brain works).

It is an additional mental load that I need to take on. It was getting to the point where anything that was even a bit hard to manage was suddenly my responsibility to deal with. We decided to write out a chart of 0-100% that is posted on the wall of \u2018I need help, I can\u2019t do it\u2019 at 0% to \u2018I don\u2019t need help, I can do it\u2019 at 100%. 50% is \u2018I can do it, but I\u2019d like support.\u2019 \n\nThe issue may not be the alarm, it\u2019s probably at the 100% for you. The problem is all of the other requests/demands because those are probably at 0-75% but you are throwing them all into 100% because it\u2019s easier. It\u2019s not on purpose necessarily, it was a hard conversation my husband had to have with his therapist, but it was an important one.\n\nI really honestly suggest you make a chart like my husband and I did and do the hard work of evaluating all of the things you truly \u2018can\u2019t do\u2019 (ie: emotionally regulate hearing a lullaby) vs things you \u2018can do, but you\u2019d like support\u2019. Then, if the support section is too big, evaluate again what you really need support for.\n\nI am not placing a judgement on this post.

It doesn\u2019t have to be the specific one, but smelling a body wash in that same register (\u201cmen\u201d scented body washes) make me feel weird. Turns out that when I talked about it to my therapist, he identified it as a form of cptsd, and that kind of scent being a trigger. \n\nTherapy might not make the discomfort fully go away, but it can help make it more manageable, and make you more able to work towards a compromise with your girlfriend", "This.

I don't disagree that avoiding lullabies forever might be impossible or that a compromise wouldn't be ideal, but her response to OP confiding in her about their trauma was absolutely disgusting, transphobic (specifically enbyphobic), and heartless.\n\nThere was absolutely no empathy or understanding from her according to this post, and that's a bigger red flag for me than anything about the lullaby itself.

And to explain autism to her. \n\nYes we are responsible for our triggers but half of that is learning to avoid them. If a parter can\u2019t compromise on not doing something triggering they aren\u2019t the partner for an autistic person. Neurotypical people will never understand what sensory disorders are like. They don\u2019t get how visceral our reactions to sounds, smells, textures, etc can be. And in a half asleep state it IS impossible to utilize coping mechanisms because, duh,  half asleep. \n\nI implore any neurotypical people to watch [this](https://youtu.be/W3h8CMcS7gc?si=gvgt2I-yC7vvPcqh)", "Yeah if my husband said something silly upset him that meant something important to me, I'd WORK WITH HIM AND NOT BE A CNT to make us both happy and content. \n\nDo yall not understand how relationships work. NTA", "I'm boggled by this type of response all over this post. Reddit's obsession with who has or hasn't what 'right' or other strikes again.\n\nIf two people are in a relationship, then it's reasonable to expect they care about each others comfort and emotional well-being! And be willing to make adjustments and compromises to support each other! \"This currently triggers me, could you consider changing it?\" Is an utterly reasonable request. Especially if it's just about a morning wake up song and not an all the time ban like OP clarified. Making this request without having to clarify \"not for all time forever and ever amen btw, just while it's relevant and harmful to me\" seems like common sense. Giving up something small that's nice but not essential and finding something else that works is a no brainer when the other option is continuing to trigger someone you claim to care about. There are other soothing and gentle little diddies that one can use as an alarm. Get you some birdsong, homegirl. Turn on one of Chopin's nocturnes. Joe Hisaishi's Ghibli tunes will blast your tits clean off with some soothingness.\n\nRecommendations aside. Being partners means meeting each other where you're at. Sometimes it means being inconvenienced, or changing something you otherwise like so that everyone is happy. If currently something is causing the other emotional harm, there is nothing unreasonable about them starting a conversation to address it so everyone is thriving. Relationships are a constant game of balance and compromise and having these conversations as we grow and change.  Sometimes that means maybe going without a small but nonessential thing we like, because we recognize our partner's wellbeing is more important in the long run than a song to wake up to.\n\nAddressing trauma and trauma responses takes time. They can't just flip a switch to 'fix' it and thus not mildly inconvenience their partner's preferences. Besides which, OP is already in therapy, which means they are in the process of doing so. They are doing everything right in that regard, then. They may be in the process for years, or months, or the rest of their life. Childhood trauma is HARD to deprogram, and only possible when the people in our lives care enough to support us and meet us where we're at. That the girlfriend reacted how she did with misgendering, insults, and to \"grow up\" is mean and shows zero empathy for or concern for her partner. Even if it is because OP has not explained the depth of their trauma to her so she can't completely understand (and I think if this relationship is to continue and flourish then they must share the depth of their trauma in full with her) - even then, her response was mean and unsympathetic. \"Man up\"? \"Get over it\"? It makes me doubt her character that she reacted with anger to her partner when they were trying to explain but began stuttering and 'losing their composure', which might mean becoming upset and distraught as much as it might mean becoming angry. We don't know. We do know her reaction was inappropriate.\n\nIt just seems like a situation that would be best served by OP openly communicating their past and associations with the music and their feelings/meltdowns. For the situation to improve and relationship to continue healthily, they would need to reach a point of understanding and find a compromise that keeps them both happy and safe - and gf would 100% need to apologize for the misgendering and trying to enforce toxic masculinity, as well as being callous (and if OP's becoming upset was anger and aggressive language, then they would need to apologize as well.) \n\nCommunication and compromise makes relationships work. shortsighted beliefs like 'no one has the right to ask me to mildly inconvenience myself or change my habits ever' is a chronically online and specifically on Reddit take which will tank every romantic, platonic, and familial relationship if given the chance.", "Your partial right, but the way she treats him and her lack of interest in compromise is showing that she doesn't care about his feelings,  she tells him to man up, that's rude and sexist.", "Asking wasn't unreasonable.

My recommendation is to discuss this with the therapist and then Talk about how you feel with the GF. If she keeps demeaning you then don't have sleep overs. You don't work things out with mean people, you leave them. I have a hard time emotionally regulating in the morning too. And sounds trigger me emotionally sometimes.", "OP, I can understand where you both come from. I would perhaps suggest offering a compromise to where if she needs to wake up before you uses a different alarm tone and if she wakes up after another. I have an iPhone so I apologize with being unfamiliar with how others work, but I am able to have different alarm tones or songs for different alarms. My partner has a sensitivity to one alarm/song so I use it when he is gone. \n\nI do think she should apologize for telling you to \u201cman up\u201d however do not expect one (sorry to say as I do not know if she will get defensive about this). Please talk to her about this when your emotions can be better regulated. There are some phrases that I grew up hearing and/or saying. I used to love using the phrase \u201cyour mom\u201d to be a jokester. One of my now best friends in the world, told me about a couple years after knowing them and ALWAYS using that phrase that both parents had actually passed away. I was obviously mortified about the use of your mom directed at him so often so I apologized and said I would stop. Next day, I said it again as a natural response and I can\u2019t begin to tell you how horrible I felt since I knew now. I apologized again and I have not used that phrase and it has been 5 years. Did it bother them that I used the phrase? No. I cared enough about that friend to make changes to what I was so used to sayin. It isn\u2019t always easy to change and there may be slipups, but if she truly cares after you explain how you felt she should make an effort and hopefully apologize.", "Hey so I\u2019m autistic too and I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from on this. My mom still infantilises me to this day, and I am 23 lol. I do understand your frustration because there\u2019s times I run into things where someone does something that feels like something my mom does and will make it really hard for me to work through because of that, but I think focusing on who is an AH isn\u2019t the right approach to this? I think the right approach is to think about is to work with your therapist on how to better handle things which are similar to what you went through but not actually the same if that makes sense? \n\nMy autism does a lot of false equating and for me a lot of what helps is to pinpoint what the issue was, such as your mom\u2019s infantilisation, and that the lullabies were a sort of tool she used for that but weren\u2019t the problem in and of itself, and that the lullaby itself doesn\u2019t have the ability to be infantilising, and your gf isn\u2019t playing it to try and infantilise you. These are probably all things you know, but at least for me, these are just the kinds of things I try to remind myself of whenever I run into a situation like this comes up :) I hope this helps!!", "A woman should think good and hard before telling a man to \"Man Up,\" for the fact that it is mutually exclusive with them processing their emotions in a healthy way. The expectations that a man 'Man Up' dovetails flawlessly with the idea that a man should never acknowledge their emotions, save for anger, and should rely on force and aggression to solve their own issues.\n\nTo tell a man to 'Man Up' is an open endorsement of Toxic Masculinity - and you can't cherry pick the parts of Toxic Masculinity that you like for yourself.\n\nNow -- this is made all the worse by the fact that *you are not a man and do not identify as such*. So there's an inherently transphobic element to it that is extra disrespectful.\n\nNot to say this misstep is worth burning down everything -- but it definitely concerns me.\n\nShe's totally in the right as far as the lullaby is concerned - it's a song she plays *for her* and not *for you*, so there's really no sense in which it could be *infantilizing you*. So I do think that's something to try and work through. Not to say it cant trigger some latent frustration and resentment in you, but that's a problem you need to work on rather than one she should accommodate. Whether you can or can't move past it, you should at least try and understand that there is no sense in which this is *infantilizing* you, because it is not *for* you. It can make you feel feelings, and maybe even to an extent that you can't fully control. But that's a separate thing.\n\nSo you could benefit from trying to internalize the idea that just because you are hearing this music, it isn't about you on any level.

And that's okay. He loves me. But we've found it easier to talk about how to do those accommodations in ways that don't feel like an eventual annoyance or burden. We've also talked about ways of creating extras in our relationship that help him feel accommodated so it doesn't feel one-sided. \n\nFor example, something like this I won't bring to his attention unless I've tried three things to solve it on my own. This way he knows if I've brought it up I've put in the effort to be an adult and work out my own problems.

There's a big difference between things you genuinely need accommodation for, and things you need to actually deal with in order to grow as a person. This is certainly one of the latter. I used to have horrific RSD that would make me sulk like a bastard any time I was told to do something, and that was a REAL problem when I started work.

Changing her alarm tone to something that still works for her but doesn't trigger OP seems like a relatively simple thing to do, and the fact that she hasn't even tried to find something else makes me think she's the AH.\n\nIt's also possible that since the traumatic memory was hearing a lullaby in bed and then having to go to sleep, that the current scenario of hearing the alarm while in bed and then having to go to sleep is triggering but hearing a lullaby out and about might not be.\n\nAlso, based on the post, OP's mom sang the same lullaby every night, so chances are it's not *every* lullaby, just ones that sound similar to the specific one their mom sang.", "I'm incorporating gender-up into my vocabulary right this moment.

My partner and I were in fact able to choose alarms that woke us up and conditioned ourselves not to wake up to the other persons.

It's not. \n\nYes and no, you yourself were just arguing that sleeping in the same bed as a partner comes with sacrifices, so you're not applying the same standard. You're applying the standard of \"make sacrifices to sleep in the same bed\" to OP and the standard of \"you get to listen to what you want because you like it\" to OP's partner. What criteria exactly are you using to make this distinction? Why does OP have to sacrifice and their partner doesn't?

My partner and I have gotten into arguments over music before (I don\u2019t like loud aggressive music it makes me anxious) but I don\u2019t expect him to never play these genres around me. Being in a relationship means negotiating your own personal preferences and deciphering major wants vs needs. My partner plays his music while he gets ready, we play mutually liked music in the car.

It was such a chaotic and annoying noise. I can't believe Apple created such a terrible sound. The first time I heard it I wanted to get out of bed and throw the damn phone out of the window. The sound of the alarm made me angry in general, but also angry at him for choosing it. I never brought it up to him because he's a heavy sleeper and if that horrible noise got him out of bed then I'm not going to tell him he can't use it. But man, I woke up really fucking angry every time that alarm went off. I learned to just accept it and I woke up less annoyed by it over time but I never felt positive toward it. Being surrounded by things I love when that horrible sound started didn't make me hate it any less. I didn't tell him how much I hated it until after he switched to something different. \n\nAll that's to say that, yes, OP is laying next to someone they love but that's not necessarily enough to recondition your response to a sound you hate.
