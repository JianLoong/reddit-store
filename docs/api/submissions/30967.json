I was diagnosed at seven years old, and after that, my family always treated me like I was several years younger than I was. I was deemed incapable of looking after myself, never allowed to walk or take the bus to school or go out on my own (to the shopping centre, for example) without my parents in the same building. My mother in particular insisted on singing a lullaby to me every night for eleven years. \n\nI moved out as soon as I hit 18, and had to miss out on the chance to go to university so that I could work full time to support myself (most of my family, including my parents, cut me off for being \"ungrateful). I have been in therapy to help me process these issues, but they are very deep-seated.\nI met my girlfriend (F24) two years ago at the local library. She asked for my number and we hit it off right away. I have told her about my issues, but not in great depth.\n\nThree weeks ago, the lease on her apartment was up and we decided to rent a place together. We went half on everything, the deposit, the utilities and the rent. We also share a bed. I get up for work at 8 AM every week day, because my boss supports me in my newd for routine so my shifts always start at the same time. My girlfriend has odd shifts, and can wake up between 5:30 and 9 AM. I have no issue with this, I would just roll over and go back to sleep, but her alarm tone is what I don't like.\n\nIt's a lullaby. Not the same one my mother sang, but it makes me uncomfortable with how similar it is. Four times so far, her alarm has gone off before mine, and I couldn't go back to sleep because I was emotionally upset. Yesterday, I had a meltdown after she left the house, and had to call off \n work. \n\nThis evening, when I was calmer and she hadn't had a day of work that would maybe make her too tired for an important conversation, I brought up that I'd her to change her alarm tone, because it makes me feel infantilised again. She sighed, and said that she liked it because it was the same song as her grandma's music box and woke her up gently. I tried to explain why I disliked it so much, but I was rapidly losing my composure. I stuttered for a bit, then she got angry and told me \"If you don't want to feel infantilised you should man up\" (I am nonbinary, but assigned male at birth) \"and get over it, it's just an alarm. Grow up.\"\n\nShe went to stay with her mother for the night. I still love her, and don't want to break up, but I told my sister who I still have contact with, and she said it was a stupid thing to fight over, and I should have just left it alone.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit 1: She plays this music at other times too, sometimes in the evening, and I have no issue, if I'm uncomfortable I can go to a different room. It's just in the mornings as soon as I wake up, when i can't emotionally regulate as well.", "created_utc": 1699954388, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uyov5/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_change_her_alarm/", "score": 1531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a part of her routine for as long as she\u2019s needed it. \n\nShe has fond memories of lullabies. It makes waking up easier for her, and her sleep schedule is irregular so it\u2019s already more difficult for her to wake up at different times. \n\nAnd what if you have kids in the future? Will you ban all lullabies from your household forever? You will not allow your kids to be sung to sleep by any lullaby simply because you have bad associations with 1 singular song? \n\nNo one should \u201cman up\u201d or subscribe to sexist terms. But yes you\u2019re wrong for banning an entire genre of music from being played by your girlfriend simply because you have bad associations with 1 singular song of that genre.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same song, it\u2019s just the same genre of music. You have to learn that one song is not representative of an entire genre and that other people can have positive associations with a genre you\u2019ve had a bad experience with.", "INFO:\n\n* Did you actually explain to her what happened after she left, that this was not simply a case of *feeling* infantilised but that it actually triggered for you to the point you had a meltdown and left unable to work for the day?\n\nBecause if you didn't, it is possible all she's heard is you find it upsetting and want her to stop with something that she finds comforting. \n\nYou've said that you told her about your issues didn't go into great depth. So it is more than possible that she doesn't understand how disturbing this is to you.  \n\n* Have you actually asked how long she's had this as an alarm tone?\n\nFor all we know, she's woken up to this tune for years. It could be a habit as well as a comfort to her. \n\n* Have you been addressing the triggering nature of the type of music with your therapist?\n* If you've not already discussed addressing it with your therapist, will you now?\n\nLook, I have an issue with the terminology she used when she told you to \"man up\" but you need to appreciate that lullabies will be something you will encounter in future, in shops, in clips of certain tv shows, in friends' houses, possible in your own home if you have kids in future. You need to work on addressing it to minimise the impact on your future, whether your future is with this girlfriend or not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I don't see the issue in you asking. The issue is if you are demanding, not considering alternatives and/or not hearing her. If you didn't properly explain it to her, that you would have come across as an AH to her. \n\nAnd like I said, I have an issue with her terminology \"man up\" and her response as a whole. You said she was angry when she said this - well, you're going to have to work out whether in her anger she revealed a little red flag of her real feelings, or if in her anger she misspoke/chose the wrong words to relay how she really feels. The whole grow-up-and-get-over-it idea isn't good, but if you've minimised with her the extent of what you went through then she may well be thinking you are making a mountain out of a molehill.", "YTA. I'm sorry but your issues with lullabies are exactly that, your issue. It's not even that your issue is with a single lullaby but all lullabies. It maybe fair to ask her to change her alarm temporarily while you sort this out through therapy or other means, but not permanently. Your girlfriend's alarm has sentimental meaning to her.\n\nAlso, if you admit you can barely keep your composure in a conversation about a lullaby alarm then that's just more reason to deal with your trauma. This seems to be really triggering for you so I wish you the best in working this out.", "YTA. This is a YOU problem. If the lullaby bothers you, then discuss it in therapy and work on it. She should not have to change something that helps her because you don't like it. She doesn't need to change anything. You were way too demanding and unreasonable.", "NAH. But I think you should address this in therapy. If every single lullaby is going to trigger you this extremely you need to solve that because there\u2019s going to be so many instances where you\u2019ll accidentally hear a lullaby. Have you tried EMDR?", "\u201cI have told her about my issues, but not in great depth.\u201d This is where the solution lies. If you tell her the core of the problem, and the fact that it only bothers you in the mornings, you two might be able to find a solution. Also, keep working with your therapist on realizing this one song is indeed different from the one your mom sang to you, like Calm_Brick_6608 so eloquently explained. NAH.", "Aside from all the other comments, I just want to say that the whole 'man up' comment makes your partner an AH. Next to keeping up the whole 'tough masculinity' trope, saying such a thing to someone that is already having difficulties with not feeling true to one's AMAB gender is a major AH move.\n\nI hope you don't feel like you have to man up- your emotions and triggers are valid and working through them is a slow and sensitive process. It sounds like your partner doesn't seem to understand the severity of your trauma's and doesn't care much to seek a middle ground. \n\nI'm proud of you for moving out and choosing yourself first even though you get so much extra emotional trouble for it. I hope you know keeping guard over your triggers and communicating your needs and when something becomes to much is completely fine and healthy. Healing is more important than new relationships, and if your partner is not on that same page, it might be better to move on.\n\nEdit: Removed 'too' after 'makes your partner an AH' because I think your NTA here.", "I think you've gotten pretty solid advice on this so far, but I'd just add that it's important to recognize when you're losing your composure and to call a pause before it goes further downhill.  Some conversations require a second cup of tea.", "NTA for asking. But this whole thing went down pretty badly. \n\nI understand you got upset, which is why you had trouble verbalising your issue clearly. It happens to us all sometimes. She went above and beyond a civil conversation with what she said and how she has behaved. No one needs to 'man up'. Men have feelings too and you have very negative ones attached to this sort of noise. \n\nIn saying that, she does not have to change it because it brings her good memories. Idk if a compromise can be made somehow.", "NTA. I've been in a relationship for almost 20 years, and wow what the heck is with these responses? If my SO started having hypervigilance because of my morning alarm, I would simply change it because I care about them. They would do the same for me.\n\nIt does seem like there are some conflicting access needs here because the gf needs an alarm that wakes her up gradually. Well, so does OP. So idk what the rest of y'all are so angry about, it seems reasonable to discuss a mutual compromise that everyone can agree to.\n\nMy SO and I actually ran into a similar issue with what music to fall asleep to. I prefer podcasts, they prefer listening to the same song on repeat forever. We figured out the Enya Pandora station works for both of us. This is just life when you choose to share it with another person.\n\nOP, it sounds like talking this out with your mouth words might be difficult. It might be helpful to write down what you are trying to communicate. You said your gf doesn't know all the details about what you experienced. I'm hoping that (unacceptable name calling aside), she maybe just didn't understand how this impacts you. For example, if you started with the title of this post \"this alarm makes me feel infantilized\" and then lost words. ..I could definitely understand her response being to perceived toxic gender norms. My hope is that she's not so attached to an alarm that she's ok with sending you into a PTSD spiral. If she is, then you have bigger problems and it's probably good to find out now.", "NTA. You tried to talk to her reasonably and she lashed out in a way she knew would hurt you in a very personal manner.\n\nThis right here:\n\n>I stuttered for a bit, then she got angry and told me \"If you don't want to feel infantilised you should man up\" (I am nonbinary, but assigned male at birth) \"and get over it, it's just an alarm. Grow up.\"\n\nYeah, that's a ***huge*** red flag, get the fuck out of this relationship.", "Sleep in earplugs, so you don't hear her alarm, just your own. \n\nNAH.", "Info: when you say you rapidly lost your composure, what did that look like? Were you being rude or name calling? What your partner did in saying \"man up\" is a substantial red flag, I'm just wondering if the heat was matched on both sides.", "The comments on this post are so rancid holy shit. If OP had a boyfriend everyone would say boyfriend is an asshole and he clearly does not care for OP's emotional needs.\n\nChanging your alarm in order to not cause your LOVED ONE distress is such a small simple thing, I would not think twice before doing it and I feel sorry for all potential partners and friends of the people commenting on this post. You sound like shitty people to be around.\n\nOP, your girlfriend sound not only like a selfish person, but she does not respect you. You don't talk to someone you love like this then leave. I know you are attached and breaking up is very hard since you're living together but it might be the best scenario for you. If she is not willing to understand you and try and HELP instead of dismiss your feelings (resulting from fucking trauma, which you can't help) she is not the kind of person you want to spend your life with.\n\nI hope you have close friends that do care about you and that will support you and tell you how this behaviour is horrible, unlike your sister. God, I can't imagine someone behaving to my little sister the way your girlfriend did and then me blaming HER for it", "NTA\n\nIf you're both in bed and you both have to hear it, it's not *her* alarm.  It's an alarm that is notifying both of you, she just happens to be the one setting it.   \n\nYou're in the same bedroom, certain things must be agreed upon. door open or closed?   fan?  heavy or light blankets?  perfect darkness or little light?  noise, including any music either wants to play in bed.  That last one is where you're at.  Setting an alarm is setting music to play.  If your girl doesn't like crunk, don't play that in the bedroom forcing it on her.

Soft ESH. This reads as an immature argument over a non-issue. \n\nThe lullaby is triggering for you and you need to deal with it. Should she have been more compassionate? Absolutely. Does she need to understand more about autism? 100%. Is it actually her problem? Not really. \n\nWhen I had a miscarriage, all I saw everywhere were babies. My friends were all announcing their bundles of joy and the whole thing was very triggering for me. I had to sit down and deal with them. I got upset. That\u2019s okay! \n\nOne of the things I\u2019m most grateful to my parents for is their attitude of \u2018the world isn\u2019t going to change so you need to deal with it\u2019 towards my disabilities and autism. It\u2019s harsh but ultimately, realistic. You get the disability aids. You rearrange your schedule. You make a plan for when you\u2019re overwhelmed and you get on with it. \n\nAs harsh as my post may sound, I truly wish you the best of luck! You are doing wonderfully well to be independent at such a young age and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get there with your girlfriend :3", "Leaning to NTA.\n\nThis is a difficult one because I firmly believe that when it comes to triggers, we are definitely in charge of how we deal with them ourselves. They show us something that we need to work on **but not** use to control other people's actions. It seems as though you are working through said issues with a therapist, however, which is fantastic - keep going, proud of you.\n\nI think working on your ability to remain composed when discussing your feelings and why they're raw is important here. Approaching with kindness always wins.\n\n**BUT**\n\nit is unacceptable for her to use your NB/Gender.  I would say this is a massive red flag that when there's a disagreement, she may resort to very personal attacks that have the propensity to destroy the relationship instantly.\n\nShe's the AH.", "NTA. This is beyond simple 'bad associations'. The mistreatment and trauma you endured probably does rise to the level of C-PTSD, and lullabies are a trigger for you.\n\nIf you don't have a therapist, and you can afford it, I think you should get one. If you do have a therapist, it might be a good idea to have them explain to your girlfriend how CPTSD, triggers, trauma, etc. work and how that's related here. Alternatively, write a letter to your girlfriend so that you dont have to explain things on the spot and you can get your thoughts out more coherently.\n\nLastly, if it's \"just an alarm clock\", why is it such a big deal for *her* to change it? The negative effect for her of having a different alarm tone would be a lot less than the negative effect her current alarm is having on you. You literally had a meltdown and had to call off work because of it.", "Wow I\u2019m surprised at some of these comments.\n\nI would never want to make my partner feel uncomfortable or upset ever.\nIt\u2019s just an alarm tone and adults need to compromise in relationships.\n\nNTA but she is for that comment and running home to mummy at the first sign of conflict.", "ESH\n\nHer response was terrible, absolutely mean and uncalled for. Telling you to \"man up\" is unacceptable. \"Grow up\" is pretty crappy too. You said you don't want to break up over this but you really should consider it. \n\nHowever, I don't think you handled this well either. Have you asked her to change a lot of other things to appease your autism? That could be why she didn't react well. She could be feeling like this is one thing she has to wake up nicely but has to change her life AGAIN for you because you can't deal with something. \n\nLook, I get trauma and how weird and it is and the associations. But I am trying to wrap my mind around how your mother singing you a lullaby is that traumatic. Infantilizing people with disabilities is not okay but, unless there was other trauma like physically hurting you or other emotional abuse I can't see how you can't try to reframe this in your mind as your mother caring for you. The reasons she did it is crappy, but was the actual act of sing to you that bad? \n\nI have had some trauma that I had to reframe because it was really affecting my life. The more I thought about how I hate it, the more it bothered me, the more reactive I got when it happened. Reframing that, yes, it was bad for me, but it isn't for most people & essentially I needed to get over it really helped deescalate the situation for me. Now, it bothers me but usually not enough to say anything or effect my day at all.\n\nI understand it's hard work & I am really hoping you luck in the future.", "I'm autistic too, and I also sometimes have strong reactions to things that remind me of past traumas. \n\nYTA, though.\n\nShe would be infantalizing you if she made YOUR alarm a lullaby because she thinks you're acting immature. She is simply continuing a practice for herself that she has done for years. You want to deny her a comfort to make yourself more comfortable. If the mere sound of any lullaby makes you this upset, you need to get into some talk therapy. \n\nEarly morning meltdowns suck, and they make the rest of the day suck. But you can't ask your GF to deactivate a key part of her personality. Maybe you need to sleep in separate rooms until you can get the emotional disregulation under control.", "YTA. If it was the same lullaby I\u2019d be on your side but you\u2019re talking about an entire genre/area of music. \n\nBut beyond that you admit that your girlfriend doesn\u2019t know the depth of your issues. You don\u2019t have to spill your guts about everything on the first date but your behavior seems a bit unfair and dishonest. If I moved in with someone and found out their issues and expectations were far beyond what they presented and that they were so easily triggered I\u2019d be pissed. \n\nPart of healing and treatment is being aware of when you are and are not ready for a relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were ready for a serious live-in relationship in the first place.", "NTA?? Idk about y\u2019all but if I told my partner their alarm triggered me they'd change it like, yesterday. And I'd absolutely do the same for them. I also would never tell my NB partner to \u201cman up\u201d.\nHow can you say you love someone but still be unwilling to sacrifice something so small? For just a friend or stranger sure. But someone you may spend your life with?? No wonder no one can manage a relationship lmao. So needlessly selfish.", "She should not have used the phrase \u201cman up.\u201d   But she\u2019s right. You\u2019re basically saying you aren\u2019t mature enough to handle something infantilizing. Like, which is it?  Are you a child that needs to be catered to?  Or are you an adult who exists in the world and needs to own their own trauma response?", "NTA. Neurotypicals don't seem to get this, but you're waking up every single day to bad memories. Your girlfriend should not want to do that to you. This is a very easy accommodation for her to make that will make a large difference to you. You tried to explain that in an understanding and thoughtful way, and as we autistic folks often experience, your explanation was brushed off and you were infantilized again. She was an AH, but hopefully if you educate her more an your autism and your different needs she will be more accepting. \nI repeat: NTA. You can't change how your brain works, and a lifetime of trauma can't be brushed aside.", "I say YTA, the lullaby was not set to your phone and it isn\u2019t the same song, it\u2019s a different song. That\u2019s not infantilising you, if she\u2019d set YOUR phone with the alarm then THAT would be infantilising. To me stating that you having to hear an alarm that doesn\u2019t belong to you is infantilising you is the same as some people grossly mislabelling something as parentification or gaslighting when actually it\u2019s nothing of the sort.\n\nYou demanded to change something that she feels dearly about, again your words a song that is *not* the song your mother sang to you, but a different song *her* grandmother sang to her. I understand that autism is a spectrum and there are many ways to manage it but this is one you will have to manage by finding the disconnect between one song and another. Because my main thing here, again is the fact that it isn\u2019t the same song.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have been treated the way you had with your family but in order to make the relationship last you need to disconnect your hate for a song that you weren\u2019t sang to as a child. Best of luck", "I don't think you're TA, because you can't just switch off your reaction to this. But some people need to wake up a certain way. I have a hardcore dance track with a slow buildup, because I need it so start calmly and get more and more aggressive. I've tried just slower songs but I sleep through. I've tried hard music from the start but jolting me awake suddenly leaves me tired and moody all day. This works. And it sounds like being woken with a lullaby is the way your gf wakes up. You're going to have to find a way to deal with it to stay together. Or maybe consider separate rooms.", "In all fairness, soft YTA - she is right, and this is something you need to deal with instead of demanding that the world accommodate you. This is an unreasonable expectation, and it means something equally important to her. Whilst we do need some accommodations in order to be able to get through life, a diagnosis of autism is NOT a crutch to demand unreasonable things of people just because you don't want to unpick and learn to deal with some of your issues. It's a framework to allow you to better understand your limitations and build workarounds that suit your needs. By refusing to cope with this issue, you are actually infantilising *yourself*. Whilst I hate the term \"man up\", she's not entirely wrong in the general intention. This is something you have to come to terms with and she shouldn't have to bend on this.", "\nIt sounds like you have a bit of PTSD that is triggered by a certain type of music. If I were living with you, I would absolutely change my alarm to another type of music. In my mind, your extreme negative reaction would trump my lullaby haze. It's a no-brainer to me and a fairly easy compromise. I'm sorry your gf doesn't see it that way. It also sounds to me like she has empathy issues. A clear sign of that is that she actually got defensive and said, \"man up\" and \"grow up\" to you when you were trying to explain what was going on for you. Oy! The ability to compromise and empathize are both important factors in any healthy relationship so if you notice that your gf has issues with either as your relationship evolves, you may want to invite her into your therapy sessions. As far as the alarm goes, maybe wear ear plugs? Definitely talk about this whole scenario with your therapist, though. NTA", "YTA. This is a you problem. If you expect the world to tip toe around you then prepare for a life of disappointment. While I don't necessarily agree with the \"man up\" language I do agree with the \"grow up\" portion. Your whole point of this post is to complain about being treated like a child when you in fact act like a child. See a therapist and sort your life out.", "NTA. Sounds pretty reasonable and if she cares about you she would have at the very least addressed it in a kinder way. She sounds like a bit of an AH. Is this something that's ever come up before in your relationship? She may not really understand you very well which is unfortunate as you've just moved in together.\n\nYou may need to have a deeper conversation with her about your personal struggles and find out if she is willing to be understanding and patient or if she just isn't capable at this stage in her life.", "NTA Her reaction to something that would be a slight inconvenience to her but big accommodation for you is weird and over the top. Like what, partners should care about each other's comfort.", "YTA. You don't seem ready for a relationship, my dude. It's not even the same samn song! Get therapy and let her find a proper adult partner, not one who throws tantrums over an alarm.", "NTA\n\nIf it's a big deal to you then it is a big deal. That's how relationships work. She was TA for dismissing what you said. It's not that you dislike the song, it triggers you and you had a full meltdown because of it. No partner should want to trigger their loved one like that.\n\nThat you should eventually get over it, maybe? But that's not the point. The song upsets you to the point of disrrupting your day, she should see that and change the song while you figure your trauma out.", "YTA. \n\nI am autistic. Everything I\u2019m about to say should be heard with that being considered. \n\nThe world does not, and will never revolve around your triggers. There are reasonable accommodations and unreasonable ones. This is not an autism issue, this is not a reasonable accommodation. This is an issue with your childhood that can and should be worked through. Seek some help for your mental health issues regarding your childhood. Not everything is because of your autism. This is not an autistic issue. The issue is being made worse because of your autism, but the issue is not your autism. \n\nWhat you need to stop doing is infantilizing yourself. You do not get to ask people to change the things they like because it makes you uncomfortable. Your meltdown was because of unresolved childhood issues, not because of an inherent issue with your autism symptoms. You need to learn the difference. You are still responsible for your mental health even if you\u2019re autistic. There are things you can work through, and things you can\u2019t. This is something you can work through. \n\nDo not be *that* autistic that thinks they\u2019re entitled to a life with no discomfort. You still have to deal with uncomfortable feelings.

My husband spent money on a dinosaur ringtone and after 3 mornings of being startled awake I told him to change his alarm if he wanted to continue sleeping  in the same bed as me.

I dont have any advice on how to talk with your girlfriend, but I understand how you feel.", "NTA, your girlfriend really shouldn't have misgendered you, that super wasn't cool (unless you and she have already discussed what gendered terms you're okay with her using for you, which I hope you have).\n\nMy suggestion, other than making new memory associations with this specific song (play it while you're calm and alert and maybe having some good food, or watching a show you like - just something that you *like*, and be sure to stop the moment you're uncomfortable), will always be open and honest communication. However you can do so comfortably, over the phone, not looking at each other, etc., you need a real conversation about the issues you're having right now. Use \"I\" statements. Otherwise it's just problems on problems in the future.", "NTA, but not at all surprised that the top comment is calling you an asshole and defending your gf. This sub has a problem with being biased towards women. Guarantee you if a woman had posted this about how a man's alarm tone made her have a meltdown and missed work and when asked to change it said something sexist this sub would say he's the asshole. Since she's a women though she must have an infinite amount of reasons that make her being brushing you off and being sexist completely ok.", "NTA. \n\nI'm autistic as well and also have quite a bit of childhood trauma. I also live with someone who is not autistic and our routines have clashed against one another many times throughout our almost 8 year relationship. \n\nMy advice for you is this: talk to her in depth about your autism and how it affects you personally. Discuss your traumas and your triggers openly with her. Nobody else in the world has the exact same combination of traumas and triggers as you, so unless you talk to her there is no way she'll know. \n\nYou will find many clashing moments in the future living with someone else, whether they are also neurodivergent or not. The lullaby situation is just the first problem you've encountered that has revolved around your trauma. Make sure to open ways for honest communication as soon as possible with your partner. Check in often, discuss issues as soon as they happen, and be open and honest about your feelings and your mental health.\n\nAt the same time, make sure you're in touch with your therapist and discuss with them your relationship insecurities, questions, and miscommunications as often as you can. You will most likely need to learn how to deal with the parts of your partner that you do not like that much but are important to her, like the lullaby and how it reminds her of her grandma. \n\nIf the lullaby ends up staying, I would recommend you discuss this in length with your therapist to find out exactly why it triggers you so much and how you can work on it. I'm not a medical professional but EMDR has done wonders for my PTSD and my very vivid flashbacks. \n\nI would like to end by saying that if I were you, I would avoid coming to AITA in the future to discuss things that affect your mental health or your traumas. People can be cruel in these whereabouts and the last thing you want is someone putting you down without having the first clue about what being autistic feels. \n\nSending a virtual hug to you.", "NTA.

The issue is that if she really care about you, she should care that it upsets you so much. And I\u2019m especially concerned that she told you to man up.

Even without explaining the reason (which is very valid btw) that's something a loving partner should be prepared to just do for you. Her reaction to your request is weirdly strong and especially the 'man up' comment sounds very deliberately hurtful and over the top given the topic.

If she has to get up earlier, she uses a different alarm. You sleep in different beds if she has to get up earlier. Or maybe you could sit down with your girlfriend and see if you can form a different memory with her particular melody (during a different time of the day, of course). Ask her about her grandma, about the music box and all her happy memories there. Maybe find it on spotify and listen to it in an environment that seems to match the music and that you enjoy. Make it about appreciating your girlfriend's life and her story.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA, you were trying to tell her what was wrong and her reaction was uncalled for.

I was diagnosed at seven years old, and after that, my family always treated me like I was several years younger than I was. I was deemed incapable of looking after myself, never allowed to walk or take the bus to school or go out on my own (to the shopping centre, for example) without my parents in the same building. My mother in particular insisted on singing a lullaby to me every night for eleven years. \nI moved out as soon as I hit 18, and had to miss out on the chance to go to university so that I could work full time to support myself (most of my family, including my parents, cut me off for being \"ungrateful). I have been in therapy to help me process these issues, but they are very deep-seated.\nI met my girlfriend (F24) two years ago at the local library. She asked for my number and we hit it off right away. I have told her about my issues, but not in great depth.\nThree weeks ago, the lease on her apartment was up and we decided to rent a place together. We went half on everything, the deposit, the utilities and the rent. We also share a bed. I get up for work at 8 AM every week day, because my boss supports me in my newd for routine so my shifts always start at the same time. My girlfriend has odd shifts, and can wake up between 5:30 and 9 AM. I have no issue with this, I would just roll over and go back to sleep, but her alarm tone is what I don't like.\nIt's a lullaby. Not the same one my mother sang, but it makes me uncomfortable with how similar it is. Four times so far, her alarm has gone off before mine, and I couldn't go back to sleep because I was emotionally upset. Yesterday, I had a meltdown after she left the house, and had to call off \n work. \nThis evening, when I was calmer and she hadn't had a day of work that would maybe make her too tired for an important conversation, I brought up that I'd her to change her alarm tone, because it makes me feel infantilised again. She sighed, and said that she liked it because it was the same song as her grandma's music box and woke her up gently. I tried to explain why I disliked it so much, but I was rapidly losing my composure. I stuttered for a bit, then she got angry and told me \"If you don't want to feel infantilised you should man up\" (I am AMAB) \"and get over it, it's just an alarm. Grow up.\"\nShe went to stay with her mother for the night. I still love her, and don't want to break up, but I told my sister who I still have contact with, and she said it was a stupid thing to fight over, and I should have just left it alone.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

By phrasing it that way, you\u2019re immediately putting her on the defensive, since infantilizing is something that she would be doing to you, not just a feeling that you have due to a trigger. The fact that she sighed after you told her that suggests that there is a strong possibility that you use this justification a lot, and repeated asks to modify what is not objectively harmful behavior can get exhausting and excessive.

If you took stutter specific therapy for decades, you might be able to do it less often, but if it's only happening when you're losing composure that would be a complete waste of time.  (The therapy exists to help people who stutter enough that interferes with their day to day life.)  Moreover, even if you'd already taken said decades of stutter specific therapy, it's entirely possible you'd still have stuttered there and then, because - again - stuttering isn't something people can control.  Getting it to happen less often doesn't mean that it can be prevented from happening in any specific instance.\n\nShe minimized your trauma, got angry over something outside your control, expressed disdain instead of compassion when you were losing composure, and managed to work in a call for you, non-binary, to get more in line with toxic masculinity while she was at it.

On top of that, a lot of autistics are more sensitive to stimuli and literally cannot just shut it out (because that is not how their neurodivergent brain works).

Being in a relationship should include having empathy for your partner and making compromises to meet each other in the middle - even in situations where you could say \u201cthat\u2019s your issue to deal with\u201d. \n\nFor example, I have trouble with strong smells. I\u2019ve been living with my partner for about 3 and a half years. Slowly over the years my partner has completely stopped using things like the automatic mosquito sprayer, bug spray, toilet spray, etc. because the strong smells really bother me/make me feel overwhelmed. This is something he has done as a compromise for me. My aversion to strong smells is my problem to deal with, but because he loves me and knows how much it bothers me, he has made small sacrifices here and there to make things easier for me.\n\nI agree with everyone that your trigger to lullabies is something you should work on in therapy, but I also think a partner who loves and respects you would approach this situation with kindness and put the music on hold at least for a while, whilst you work through it being such a trigger for you with your therapist.\n\nEven if you weren\u2019t autistic and non-binary, it\u2019d still be an asshole move for her to not be willing to budge at all and make a small compromise for something that\u2019s really upsetting you, and it\u2019d still be an asshole move for her to tell you to \u201cman up\u201d.

But I give her the benefit of the doubt, and say that she just didn't know how much your trauma impacts you.\n\nIf you want your relationship to work, you need to properly communicate about your issues. If you're having trouble saying it to her face, maybe writing it down could help you?\n\nAlso address the misgendering. It would be sad if you broke up over simple things that you wouldn't voice because they're too simple.\n\nSending you some positive vibes. And please don't take the misgendering and judgemental comments to heart! We're all just internet strangers who don't know you, but I'm sure you're an amazing person. You've come so far!

It is an additional mental load that I need to take on. It was getting to the point where anything that was even a bit hard to manage was suddenly my responsibility to deal with. We decided to write out a chart of 0-100% that is posted on the wall of \u2018I need help, I can\u2019t do it\u2019 at 0% to \u2018I don\u2019t need help, I can do it\u2019 at 100%. 50% is \u2018I can do it, but I\u2019d like support.\u2019 \n\nThe issue may not be the alarm, it\u2019s probably at the 100% for you. The problem is all of the other requests/demands because those are probably at 0-75% but you are throwing them all into 100% because it\u2019s easier. It\u2019s not on purpose necessarily, it was a hard conversation my husband had to have with his therapist, but it was an important one.\n\nI really honestly suggest you make a chart like my husband and I did and do the hard work of evaluating all of the things you truly \u2018can\u2019t do\u2019 (ie: emotionally regulate hearing a lullaby) vs things you \u2018can do, but you\u2019d like support\u2019.

It doesn\u2019t have to be the specific one, but smelling a body wash in that same register (\u201cmen\u201d scented body washes) make me feel weird. Turns out that when I talked about it to my therapist, he identified it as a form of cptsd, and that kind of scent being a trigger. \n\nTherapy might not make the discomfort fully go away, but it can help make it more manageable, and make you more able to work towards a compromise with your girlfriend", "This.

I don't disagree that avoiding lullabies forever might be impossible or that a compromise wouldn't be ideal, but her response to OP confiding in her about their trauma was absolutely disgusting, transphobic (specifically enbyphobic), and heartless.\n\nThere was absolutely no empathy or understanding from her according to this post, and that's a bigger red flag for me than anything about the lullaby itself.

And to explain autism to her. \n\nYes we are responsible for our triggers but half of that is learning to avoid them. If a parter can\u2019t compromise on not doing something triggering they aren\u2019t the partner for an autistic person. Neurotypical people will never understand what sensory disorders are like. They don\u2019t get how visceral our reactions to sounds, smells, textures, etc can be.

NTA", "I'm boggled by this type of response all over this post. Reddit's obsession with who has or hasn't what 'right' or other strikes again.\n\nIf two people are in a relationship, then it's reasonable to expect they care about each others comfort and emotional well-being! And be willing to make adjustments and compromises to support each other! \"This currently triggers me, could you consider changing it?\" Is an utterly reasonable request. Especially if it's just about a morning wake up song and not an all the time ban like OP clarified. Making this request without having to clarify \"not for all time forever and ever amen btw, just while it's relevant and harmful to me\" seems like common sense. Giving up something small that's nice but not essential and finding something else that works is a no brainer when the other option is continuing to trigger someone you claim to care about. There are other soothing and gentle little diddies that one can use as an alarm. Get you some birdsong, homegirl. Turn on one of Chopin's nocturnes. Joe Hisaishi's Ghibli tunes will blast your tits clean off with some soothingness.\n\nRecommendations aside. Being partners means meeting each other where you're at. Sometimes it means being inconvenienced, or changing something you otherwise like so that everyone is happy. If currently something is causing the other emotional harm, there is nothing unreasonable about them starting a conversation to address it so everyone is thriving. Relationships are a constant game of balance and compromise and having these conversations as we grow and change.  Sometimes that means maybe going without a small but nonessential thing we like, because we recognize our partner's wellbeing is more important in the long run than a song to wake up to.\n\nAddressing trauma and trauma responses takes time. They can't just flip a switch to 'fix' it and thus not mildly inconvenience their partner's preferences. Besides which, OP is already in therapy, which means they are in the process of doing so. They are doing everything right in that regard, then. They may be in the process for years, or months, or the rest of their life. Childhood trauma is HARD to deprogram, and only possible when the people in our lives care enough to support us and meet us where we're at. That the girlfriend reacted how she did with misgendering, insults, and to \"grow up\" is mean and shows zero empathy for or concern for her partner. Even if it is because OP has not explained the depth of their trauma to her so she can't completely understand (and I think if this relationship is to continue and flourish then they must share the depth of their trauma in full with her) - even then, her response was mean and unsympathetic. \"Man up\"? \"Get over it\"? It makes me doubt her character that she reacted with anger to her partner when they were trying to explain but began stuttering and 'losing their composure', which might mean becoming upset and distraught as much as it might mean becoming angry. We don't know. We do know her reaction was inappropriate.\n\nIt just seems like a situation that would be best served by OP openly communicating their past and associations with the music and their feelings/meltdowns. For the situation to improve and relationship to continue healthily, they would need to reach a point of understanding and find a compromise that keeps them both happy and safe - and gf would 100% need to apologize for the misgendering and trying to enforce toxic masculinity, as well as being callous (and if OP's becoming upset was anger and aggressive language, then they would need to apologize as well.) \n\nCommunication and compromise makes relationships work. shortsighted beliefs like 'no one has the right to ask me to mildly inconvenience myself or change my habits ever' is a chronically online and specifically on Reddit take which will tank every romantic, platonic, and familial relationship if given the chance.", "Your partial right, but the way she treats him and her lack of interest in compromise is showing that she doesn't care about his feelings,  she tells him to man up, that's rude and sexist.", "Asking wasn't unreasonable.

Earplugs for you if she needs to wake up before you, or perhaps another song she can wake up gently to.\n\nShe\u2019s definitely expressed herself badly, but you are both young and easily frustrated by life doing its thing of being difficult.

She has a right to keep it. You have a right to not get triggered in your sleep. People use the word triggered too much but in this case it was genuinely a trigger for some strong feelings. My recommendation is to discuss this with the therapist and then Talk about how you feel with the GF. If she keeps demeaning you then don't have sleep overs. You don't work things out with mean people, you leave them. I have a hard time emotionally regulating in the morning too. And sounds trigger me emotionally sometimes.", "OP, I can understand where you both come from. I would perhaps suggest offering a compromise to where if she needs to wake up before you uses a different alarm tone and if she wakes up after another. I have an iPhone so I apologize with being unfamiliar with how others work, but I am able to have different alarm tones or songs for different alarms. My partner has a sensitivity to one alarm/song so I use it when he is gone. \n\nI do think she should apologize for telling you to \u201cman up\u201d however do not expect one (sorry to say as I do not know if she will get defensive about this). Please talk to her about this when your emotions can be better regulated. There are some phrases that I grew up hearing and/or saying. I used to love using the phrase \u201cyour mom\u201d to be a jokester. One of my now best friends in the world, told me about a couple years after knowing them and ALWAYS using that phrase that both parents had actually passed away. I was obviously mortified about the use of your mom directed at him so often so I apologized and said I would stop. Next day, I said it again as a natural response and I can\u2019t begin to tell you how horrible I felt since I knew now. I apologized again and I have not used that phrase and it has been 5 years. Did it bother them that I used the phrase? No. I cared enough about that friend to make changes to what I was so used to sayin.

I think the right approach is to think about is to work with your therapist on how to better handle things which are similar to what you went through but not actually the same if that makes sense? \n\nMy autism does a lot of false equating and for me a lot of what helps is to pinpoint what the issue was, such as your mom\u2019s infantilisation, and that the lullabies were a sort of tool she used for that but weren\u2019t the problem in and of itself, and that the lullaby itself doesn\u2019t have the ability to be infantilising, and your gf isn\u2019t playing it to try and infantilise you.

The expectations that a man 'Man Up' dovetails flawlessly with the idea that a man should never acknowledge their emotions, save for anger, and should rely on force and aggression to solve their own issues.\n\nTo tell a man to 'Man Up' is an open endorsement of Toxic Masculinity - and you can't cherry pick the parts of Toxic Masculinity that you like for yourself.\n\nNow -- this is made all the worse by the fact that *you are not a man and do not identify as such*. So there's an inherently transphobic element to it that is extra disrespectful.\n\nNot to say this misstep is worth burning down everything -- but it definitely concerns me.\n\nShe's totally in the right as far as the lullaby is concerned - it's a song she plays *for her* and not *for you*, so there's really no sense in which it could be *infantilizing you*. So I do think that's something to try and work through. Not to say it cant trigger some latent frustration and resentment in you, but that's a problem you need to work on rather than one she should accommodate. Whether you can or can't move past it, you should at least try and understand that there is no sense in which this is *infantilizing* you, because it is not *for* you. It can make you feel feelings, and maybe even to an extent that you can't fully control.

The sound of the alarm made me angry in general, but also angry at him for choosing it. I never brought it up to him because he's a heavy sleeper and if that horrible noise got him out of bed then I'm not going to tell him he can't use it. But man, I woke up really fucking angry every time that alarm went off. I learned to just accept it and I woke up less annoyed by it over time but I never felt positive toward it. Being surrounded by things I love when that horrible sound started didn't make me hate it any less.

She can change it - you shouldn't have peaceful alarms anyways because those are the easiest ones to sleep through. How protective and angry she got is completely unfounded, especially if she knows you're Autisic - don't move it with an autistic person if you're not prepared to make changes you deem annoying, but you cannot make your Autistic partner feel like shit about the adjustments that are needed - especially something as non concequental as am alarm. Especially since when reading your other comments you're totally fine with her playing the song in general throughout the evening, but it has to do with how regulation is a lot more difficult when waking up. You're not banning a song, you're just asking that she doesn't use that song to wake up. Hell - I know so many NT couples that have had to change their alarm sounds away from a song because \"you're alarm is starting to ruin a song I like for me because now I relate it with having to get up!\" \n\nHer alarm brings her calm and peace, okay cool - but it brings you mental anguish, makes your Autisic traits more reactive and stops you from sleeping - changing her alarm tone is not going to cause her the same anguish you are under.

Living together can change a relationship FAST.  The fact that in response to you're request she used.Transphobic language to you is disgusting and emotionally manipulative if not abusive.

It is fucked up that she is prioritizing a ringtone over your mental and physical health. It is fucked up that she weaponized your (a)gender identity. And it is fucked up that so many people here are calling this \u201ca you problem.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sorry that this happened to you, and I hope you have support to help you figure out the next steps in your relationship.", "I don't think you are an asshole for asking, not at all.\n\n As she has refused even though you find the alarm tone triggering, you have to decide if this is important enough to continue arguing about.\n\n Perhaps you can work with a therapist to desensitize yourself to the sound when you hear it waking up.\n\n I don't know much about autism and I wonder how much your condition affects your reaction. I think that maybe since you are the one with a condition that makes you struggle a bit through life, that perhaps she should be a little bit more flexible about this. \n\nYou get up at exactly the same time every day. She knows the night before when her alarm is going to go off. Sometimes it is before you get up, sometimes after. It seems to me that a reasonable compromise would be for your girlfriend to use a different alarm tone when she knows she will be awakened before you.", "ASD here and in a > quarter century long relationship\n\nThe Y.T.A.s on this post are insane to me. Either the commenters has never been in a LTR that worked well, or they have NO idea what ASD is like, or both. OP's sounds like their ASD isn't trivial but also their parents treated them poorly because of it.\n\nThey aren't asking that the girlfriend stops playing an entire genre of music. They are asking that this specific lullaby not be played at this specific time. Because waking up to it, not other times, is uncontrollable for him. He can't move to another room, he can't even anticipate it. How freaking hard is that to change? One commenter added a simple compromise, if she gets up before they do, she plays a different tune. After, she can play the lullaby. Modern tech is amazing isn't it?!?\n\nLet me give you an example. There are many sounds that make me literally uncontrollably angry. It's debilitating because some of those sounds are everywhere. People eating (not mouth open... any eating), typing, phone beeps, tapping, etc. I'm 64... I've had decades to find work arounds and therapy. For some I can remove myself, for others I wear noise cancelling headphones, others I chew hard candies to drown it out. But some I can't avoid... so I suffer through it. That said, my husband, unlike OP's GF, is incredibly thoughtful, considerate and willing to communicate with kindness. When he got his phone, the sound would be on when he types on it. I can't handle the sound, but it helps him type well. Our compromise was I would put on my headphones (I carry them everywhere) and if he notices he turns the sound on his phone off if he wants to remain in the room with me, or moves. If he doesn't, I listen brown noise and I'm fine.\n\nRelationships are ALL about communication, mutual compromise and kindness. GF definitely didn't show any of that, the comment about 'manning up' aside from the gendering is just plain mean and OP is lacking in communication skills too, sadly goes with the territory. They are young, but they really need to work on it. I'd give a soft ESH for him and a hard ESH for her.", "When I had an alarm my partner didn't like I just changed it. NTA", "NTA I agree with other commenters that this is a you problem, and that it is something you should work on. That being said, no one is ever an asshole simply for telling their partner \"I'm being triggered by something you're doing\"\n\nWhile it's true that this trigger is one that you need to work on, it's also fair to ask your partner to accommodate you while you do work on it. Her response also feels like she doesn't have a great understanding of autism.", "In my opinion NTA. It's not just the fact that your girlfriend told you to man up which is messed up in a couple of ways. It's what you said before... She sighed, was not taking you seriously even though it was something that was having an emotional impact on you, she didn't seem to care.\n\n\"If you don't want to be infantilized, then man up!\" \n\nAs in, if you don't act like she wants or like society wants then you deserve to be infantilized? If you don't \"act like a man\" (which is not even the gender you identify with) then you are less deserving of respect?\n\nTrust yourself you have the right to be happy and to feel loved and respected. Someone who loves you will find a way to understand your differences.", "NTA, you told her about something that was triggering to you and asked her if she would change it. It is something she could easily change and her reaction feels like a real overreaction. People have different triggers for different reasons. I would be upset if my partner was so dismissive of something that upset me so much and wasn\u2019t open to talking about it or trying to find a compromise that could make us both happy. You tried to have communicate with your partner and she insulted you and is now giving you the silent treatment.", "YTA. I see lots of people trying to make it out as if she is bad for saying \u201cman up\u201d but in this context it seems to be meaning \u201cgrow up\u201d rather than trying to misgender you. She did actually say grow up. \n\nAnd you should grow up, it\u2019s just an alarm. \n\nYou\u2019re using your autism as an excuse to be inconsiderate and using your nonby status as a way of appearing the victim.", "I truly can\u2019t understand all of these YTA comments. A lot of you are demonstrating your nature to simply peace keep all the time, or to treat a conversation about as an attack. Responding and calling OP unreasonable for BRINGING an issue up, is never the answer. \n\nQuite frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have skipped a beat before changing the alarm. I understand that it has sentimental meaning, but yo, it\u2019s an alarm. You could easily play another gentle sounding alarm, and listen to the music in headphones as you getting ready (ya know, since you try not to wake your partners up in the morning as best as you can). \n\nBlowing up and misgendering OP (which some of y\u2019all are also not understanding the gravity of your PARTNER doing such a thing to you) demonstrates a lot of emotional immaturity (IMO). That\u2019s crazy to me. My heart goes out to OP as you didn\u2019t deserve that. Also, \u201cman up\u201d is a nasty comment in the first place. I\u2019ve told my straight cis guy friends to stop seeing girls who have said this to them when expressing emotions. The fact that this phrase was said, plus OP was misgendered in the process really doesn\u2019t sit well with me. \n\nHonestly, I thought that the response of OPs partner was somewhat reasonable up until that point. I totally get feeling disappointed as she was likely looking forward to that routine, but after taking a breath, I\u2019d like to believe that it would upset you to know that your partner was starting their day off wrong because of you. \n\nIMO this goes has much more to do with what kind of partners OP hopes to have moving forward. I look for partners who are supportive, loving, and willing to try to hear me. I\u2019m also the same age as y\u2019all (23) and believe that this phase in my life is about standing up for myself, being my own advocate, and even practicing communication. I don\u2019t love having people surrounding me that make that harder to achieve.", "NTA. This music is traumatic for you. The reason she has for wanting to play it does not trump how upset the music makes you feel. Because it is a minor issue, my main concern is that she doesn't care how the music affects you.

If she won't work with you over an alarm tone, you can be sure the big issues aren't going to go well.", "Your girlfriend is sexist AND transphobic.

Drop everything about being autistic, non binary etc none of that matters at the root of the issue.  If someone's alarm annoys you in any way, and you both sleep in the same bed and have to listen to that alarm, it needs to change.  Full stop, end of story.  You need to both come up with an alarm that works for both of you, and if she's too petty to change that, it's time to not live together anymore.", "NTA, there\u2019s a lot to unpack here. I don\u2019t think banning an entire genre of music as an alarm is reasonable, and it\u2019s definitely something you should sort out. However, her reaction to you was so out of line that I have to say NTA for a few reasons.\n\nFirst off, it is a relatively simple request to change your alarm to help someone that you care about avoid emotional turmoil. Second and most importantly, she went to a very nasty place by telling you to man up. That perpetuates toxic masculinity and in your case is even worse because given the fact that you\u2019re NB and AMAB she is maliciously misgendering you. \n\nLastly, leaving and going to her mom\u2019s for the night was an insane overreaction over a fight about this topic and shows a general lack of regard for the relationship. I don\u2019t think the alarm is worth breaking up over, but the rest of the things here are pretty big red flags and deserve some serious consideration.", "NTA. She lucky she\u2019s not going out with me cos I\u2019m not a morning person and would probably smash her phone.

She has to wake up miserably everyday?\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair thing to ask and if my husband asked me to give up something that remembered me of my grandma I\u2019d probably be pissed too.\n\nYou guys need to talk, sure.

It sounds like your mom was deeply misguided but likely well intentioned. Your girlfriend has a positive, loving association with her alarm and it enables her to wake more peacefully. Buy some earplugs and get over yourself. Don\u2019t make your girlfriend tiptoe around your issues. Maybe she was wrong to say \u201cman up,\u201d though it\u2019s clear she was angry and it\u2019s a common expression often pointed at women, too, but she was spot on about growing up.

That said, your triggers are your triggers, and while it's true that you can and should work on this, it's not reasonable to expect you to \"get over it\" overnight.\n\nThis feels more like a particularly harsh argument than anything truly condemnable by either party.

You are asking your GF to not play an entire genre of music she enjoys, that is simply too much. \n\nIt is completely fair and completely healthy to set lines within a relationship but they need to be reasonable ones, being neurodivergent doesn't give us the right to demand others tiptoe around us. \n\nI'd suggest wearing ear plugs or asking that she doesn't play it when on early shifts if it is causing you sleep issues. \n\n(On a side note I recommend immediately playing or singing a different catchy song to remove the triggering one from the forefront of your brain).", "YTA.

It's not like she did it through your teens or as an adult) is an oddly severe reaction. \n\nThis is a seemingly normal thing for a mother to do for her child, and it happened to you over a decade ago...\n\nIdk, it just seems strange that you are still this upset over such a normal/common thing that your mom stopped doing 12 years prior to you hearing your gf's alarm that isn't even the same song sang by your mom.", "YTA definitely.

Regardless if OP fixated and caused the frustration, I feel that\u2019s the best way forward.", "I totally agree with all of this. Another point is the fact that they didn't clearly tell her their trauma before, after, or during this incident.

Like you said, early meltdowns suck and ruin the rest of the day so, to me, it makes sense to not want to wake up to the sound. living with another person is all about compromise and finding solutions that work for both parties. it's not a compromise to say OP should just suck it up. OP didn't want no lullabies at any time for the rest of their life, they just want to not wake up to it which IMO, is not a huge ask. OP's girlfriend can still listen to her grandmother's lullaby any other time, including to wake up when she gets up later than OP. \n\nhonestly, I think alarms are something every live in couple has to talk about at some point. my bf's alarm is SO loud ( IPhone ). it scares me every time it goes off. when we start living together that alarm will have to change. \n\nI agree that OP should continue the therapy they are getting and work through their trauma so they can not only listen to lullabies but also be more mentally well. but I think everyone commenting for them to get therapy should realize that therapy takes time to work and that time will just be increased if OP has to continue waking up to the lullaby.", "It's clearly more than just autism.

He said \"Be not Offended\" this was well over 20 years ago too before things got to where they are today.  He went on to say that society was headed in a direction where people would look for reasons to be offended even by the most innocent of things. Everyone has something that triggers them, and if we tried not to offend anyone then nothing would ever happen because no one would be able to say or do anything. He encouraged all of us to assume positive intent and that if we were offended by something someone said then it was probably our misinterpretation as it was not likely the person was intending to offend. If we seek out reasons to be offended we will 100% be offended. He also talked about our own agency and our own will power. If we dwell on words or music then we are giving those things power over us. Offensive and vulgar things exist but when we let them over take our emotions and consume all of our thoughts we aren't incontrol anymore. \nThink of Denis Rodman, he was a great Defensive NBA player in the 90s. Probably one of the best to play the game. He talked about getting into other player's heads, throwing them off their game, and just setting up camp in their brain for the entire game. He was constantly trash talking and trying to find out what would trigger the other player. He wanted to own all of their thoughts, he wanted that player to lose control mentally. He was a master of it. There are players he couldn't rattle because they didn't give his words the time of day. No matter how offensive or vulgar he spoke, they never dwelled on those words. We have to be the master of our own thoughts and emotions. The goal is not to hide from the things that trigger us but find ways to remove their hold and power over us. I don't recommend diving into our triggers head first, thinking you just got to will your way out of it.

OP's gf doesn't HAVE to change the alarm tone but SHOULD be willing to compromise somehow, whether that be changing the alarm or sleeping in seperate rooms. OP isn't asking to never hear a lullaby again, they're asking to not hear it first thing in the morning because they acknowledge that their emotional regulation is weaker when just waking up and it triggers their trauma. also them acknowledging that both the lullaby and their lower emotional regulation are causes, waiting to have a civil conversation when neither of them are tired or already upset, and asking for accommodation shows both emotional maturity and willingness to cope. what the post DOESNT show, is OP refusing to cope or using their autism as a crutch. \n\nOP should definitely do therapy but even then, it is NOT an immediate fix. they will still need a compromise at home. OP does not live alone.

I also am autistic and lean on routines so when I worked in a restaurant, I requested to be scheduled on the same days/hours when possible. it was not unreasonable of me to request that from my boss but it would have been unreasonable if I demanded it or refused to work outside of the routine. \n\nanother also, in some situations asking to not be around dogs is not unreasonable either, especially if that situation involves asking a friend or loved one to not bring their dog around you or to meet you somewhere that is dog free :)", "Yet they didn\u2019t demand that the world accommodate.

What I have learned about autism from my kid is that your response to the lullaby is not exactly something you can alter or control.  Your therapist is giving you skills to mask or redirect it but those skills are only meant to put some space between the stimulus and the response and they do not change the fact that when that stimulus hits your brain, it follows a different chain of events than with a neurotypical person.  You would never ask a person in a wheelchair to get up and walk and expect that they could do it, however, neurotypicals are constantly asking the equivalent of that to autistic folk and her refusal to even consider your perspective and look for an accommodation is. huge red flag.  Many of the suggestions I read here that say this is your problem are examples of that kind of ableist thinking.  You should be commended for being able to express that its something that is difficult for you and she dropped the ball for not listening and trying to meet you there.  I'm sure in your mind you recognize that its a minor thing but what NTs don't see is that small things can create HUGE challenges for NDs.  I see this constantly with my kid, where they are having to do all the work for the NTs bc the NTs can't see any other perspective.  I would suggest writing out your perspective on paper so that she can read it and you can explain your perspective in a controlled and calm way.  Be kind, be vulnerable and invite her to understand how to love you better.

OP isn't saying she can't listen to the music at other times; he is just asking her not to use it as her wake up alarm which affects him too.", "Yep. I understand having triggers to something, but it\u2019s my problem to deal with. I was bothered that OP doesn\u2019t want to be infantilized, but then expects their girlfriend to coddle them over an issue they need to deal with, not her. It\u2019s not like she was doing it purposely.", "Found the asshole it\u2019s you", "op mentioned in the post edit that there\u2019s no issue hearing lullabies at other times and that if they\u2019re uncomfortable, they can just go into another room. it\u2019s *specifically* when they first wake up in the morning when their emotions are harder to regulate that it becomes a trigger. i agree that a discussion in therapy is needed, but it isn\u2019t \u201cevery single lullaby\u201d, it\u2019s one that is very similar to the one their mother sang, and it\u2019s only first thing in the morning where it\u2019s a real issue.", "It's not as easy as just \"fixing it.\" Triggers can be extremely difficult to deal with. Yall act like it's just a pet peeve or something when it really fucking isn't. & nice totally ignoring the gf misgendering OP.", "op has autism and has trauma    op is not a shitty partner  ableist", "This is the most reasonable response, it\u2019s mind boggling that the majority of the thread says OP\u2019s the AH.", "Grow up. Your issues don't need to be hers.", "She's wrong about \"man up\" but the rest is spot on. You don't want to be infantilised? Stop acting like a child.", ">Being a good partner is about communicating what you both need from one another. OP has done so. She then flew off the handle and threw sexism at them, and the particular remark is often leveled at men/AMABs when they're upset in an effort to dismiss their feelings.\n\nikr", "while I agree that therapy is needed for OP, I really don't feel like OP's GF is owed an apology in nearly the degree OP is. OP asked for a minor adjustment to her morning routine because of their traumatic upbringing and she ultimately responded with deeply sexist and transphobic remark. any good partner could make a tiny change like this request and would want to out of respect. cohabitation takes adjustment and compromise. but more importantly, she has serious unlearning to do.", "ops gfs should also aplogise u/crystallz2000", "I agree with you. There are other ways she can keep the song in her life, and it's really messing with OP. I like my alarm, but if my bf told me it was starting to annoy him, there are dozens that come with the phone", "God imagine if people treated allergies like they do ptsd triggers.\n\n\"My partner keeps using nut powder in our food, even though I'm allergic to nuts. I've asked her to stop since it's causing me to become seriously ill and she told me to kms. Aita?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah? Yeah, you don't just get to boss people around just because something they like mildly inconveniences you. SMH my head\"", "nb pronouns are they/them btw :)", "Seriously. I don't care how much I loved a song or how meaningful to me it was, if my partner had trauma related to that type of music and me waking them up with it daily triggered an emotional response I would absolutely want to know that so I could change it immediately. OP didn't try to ban her from playing it ever, just asked that she stop using it as an alarm because having something that's an emotional trigger for your trauma waking you up first thing in the morning is horrific. But her response was to immediately dismiss what they said, misgender them and belittle them. That's a shitty partner.\n\nPeople in the comments are being weirdly hostile to OP as well, and accusing them of being aggressive and demanding she do what they say which is just such a bad faith interpretation of this post. Someone said if the song bothers them then that's their problem and they should go to therapy, as if therapy is just a magic cure that can rid you of all triggers forever. Even if it did, what should OP do in the meantime??\n\nWhen you live with someone else you have to make some compromises, and I think in the grand scheme of things changing your alarm tone and saving your lullabies for the waking hours is a pretty damn small one.", "Yeah I'm really surprised at how many people here seem unwilling to give up one TINY thing for their partner. I think in situations like this, if you really love your partner and want to be with them (more than you want your exact perfect \"I will not settle for anything that isn't EXACTLY what I want\" scenario in everyday life), then it generally should be, imo, that whoever is being negatively impacted gets to \"win.\" Like, for example: one of you hates dogs because you were bit as a kid, and one of you loves them. The person who gets to \"win\", if nobody compromises, is the person who is being negatively impacted, i.e the person with dog trauma. The other person misses OUT on some potential benefit, but they're not being NEGATIVELY affected the way the other person is. It's ofc not *always* doable and it depends on the size and seriousness of the argument, but generally I'm seeing in the comments a complete unwillingness to compromise. Which is sad. Also noting a huge lack of understanding of neurodivergence.", "As an autistic person I am infuriated but not surprised. When an aita post mentions the OP is autistic the comments are always a mixed bag of reasonable people and ablists.", "It was once", "No it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t want to hear a sound that causes distress in the mornings. He says that in the text if you actually read it.", "I agree. Seems like such a small ask, too. There are other gentle songs to wake up to.", "Absolutely. I have a specific anime opening I use to wake up (it\u2019s out of habit these days, not for any particular reason). If my partner had an issue with it (ESPECIALLY IF it had to do with trauma or neurodivergence), I wouldn\u2019t jump to defend myself and misgender them, I would go \u00ab\u00a0of course babe, this is an absolute non issue for me and it is a matter of your comfort, of course I will bock bohemian rhapsody to wake up to instead\u00a0\u00bb. I really cannot understand why people in the comments just see this as a hill to die on.", "For the people who down voted this, neither makes any sense because OP is non binary so it can't be misogyny or misandry I don't even know what the *insert random pro noun* equivalent is", "Yes, because one makes the person uncomfortable, and that should be the focus 9/10 times. Why would you want your partner to have an uncomfortable time waking up? They both have to hear the alarm. Glad she's decided that her comfort means more to her than their discomfort, and she's chosen by herself what they need to wake up to.\n\nBut I think in your head, you see OP as someone asking for concessions all the time. Maybe that's true, we have no way of knowing that though and that's a large leap to make. So if you have a partner and they ask for this one thing, then geeze, just change the ringtone.", "Finally, someone with a not fucked-up mentality on the internet.", "It's the same as \"be a proper woman\" imo.", "My partner gets scared no matter what the ringtone is for my iPhone. Androids quite possibly have different sound and vibration patterns. Watching someone trying to calm down from that shock in the morning is not a great thing. I stopped using my phone as an alarm when I sleep over at theirs and I just let them put the alarm on their phone.", "Very funny everybody clap", "The (free) alarm clock app I downloaded has a \"gentle wake up\" option which, when turned on, starts playing quiet, occasional bird sounds 30 minutes before your alarm is set to go off; as the minutes pass, the bird sounds gradually become louder and more frequent. Since I started using it, I almost never actually hear my alarm (unless I was particularly tired when I went to bed, or have to get up especially early) because I gently, gradually come to wakefulness over the course of that half hour. (Previously, I was shocked into immediate wakefulness by my alarm every morning because I had to set it at maximum volume or I risked sleeping through it, and I absolutely hated waking up every. single. morning. I don't anymore.)", "My husband has had a habit of having several alarms blare throughout the morning, starting an hour or two before he has to wake up for work, for as long as he's been in the work force, begire we even started living together. It helps him wake up gradually and he always feels content that there's still time until the last alarm, it's important for his routine, and I respect that. \n\nStill, I used to have sleep issues, and the alarms made them worse - they would start right after I was beginning to fall asleep, and would torture me until I had no sleep left in me by the time he finally left for work, and would have to sleep during the day or get no sleep at all. It took us a while to figure out a compromise - his alarms are vibration-only now, he makes sure to turn them off on weekends, and my sleel has become better in general, so I don't get woken up by his alarms as much. I still get unreasonably angry when I hear his alarms go off during the night, and have to wake him up so he would turn off the auditory torture, but it's more of a joke for us now than a source of conflict, since I only hear them rarely.", "Imo using he for a enby because \"idk what if they don't use they/them\" is... silly, frankly. Should I assume you happen to use she/her if you don't explicitly mention your prefered pronouns being they/them? Should we use everything but the most common pronoun for enbies we are unsure of? That's a weirder choice than going with the cowards they, I can say that much.", "Didn\u2019t you just say above that:\n> non-binary doesn\u2019t mean \u201cneither boy nor girl\u201d it just means \u201cnot cis and not formed fully within either box of the binary\u201d\n\nBut now you\u2019re saying:\n> non-binary isn\u2019t a third gender. it just means it\u2019s neither boy nor girl\n\nAm I missing something?", "I will give this a go, thanks for sharing.", "Edited: I thought the alarm was Night Owl but it was actually Radial. \n\nNow I'm mad just thinking about it.", "It was Night Owl lol. Listening to it now it doesn't sound bad, but being jolted awake by it every morning made me so angry. It's such a busy sound for first thing in the morning. \n\nLooking at lists of iPhone alarms it seems like Night Owl is pretty highly rated so it looks like I'm in the minority for hating it.", "So you think it's a better idea to refer to someone who you know is NB by their AGAB pronouns than with a pronoun that is nonbinary? I understand \"they\" isn't used exclusively for NB people but as far as I know the word \"they\" can refer to all genders, so I believe that makes it a nonbinary pronoun"]}
