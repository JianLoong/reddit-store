We were in line with others around us on the same flight also at risk of missing their flight. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 5:51pm with an easy 20+ minutes left in the line, and the window to board dwindling.\n\nSome other people were asking if they could cut in front of people, and they just walked right past us. This caused some commotion and I asked what time their flight was leaving. Turns out, it was scheduled to leave at 6:10, 20 minutes after our flight. \n\nI got mildly furious, dropped an unexpected \u201cgoddamnit\u201d at them, and asked them what gave them the right to get in front of any of us on a flight leaving BEFORE theirs? How was that fair?\n\nThey said nothing. They just stood there looking forward and acknowledging nothing. One of the three men was trying to calm ME down as if to relieve me of the tension he was clearly 100% responsible for.\n\nFurious at the whole thing and fearful of missing our flight, I shouted for security to come deal with the situation. What else was I to do? \n\nI didn\u2019t care that tons of eyes were on me; no doubt plenty of people felt my frustration whether in front of us in line or behind us. But from about 20 people behind us, a random woman started cursing at ME for risking holding up the line by asking for security to remedy a problem that clearly required their assistance.\n\nAcross three lines of zigzagging people, a TSA guy pushing 80 years old asked me what the problem was. I explained the situation to him and all he could muster was \u201cI can\u2019t help you, you need to call 911 if you have a problem.\u201d \n\nAre you f\u2019ing kidding me? This was a TSA employee responsible for managing the lines and he refused to do anything at all. Passed the buck and told me to call the cops.\n\nFortunately we made our flight with minutes to spare, but I\u2019m still fuming about the whole thing. I can\u2019t stand making a scene but I couldn\u2019t help it. \n\nSo\u2026 AITA for mildly losing my shit and yelling for security, or are the line-cutting, inconsiderate jerk men who cut ahead of us to make a later flight the assholes?", "created_utc": 1696900680, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1748sce/aita_for_shouting_for_security_about_people/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People are AHs everywhere and there's often nothing you can do.", "NTA.  Sorry the AH chose to cut in front of everyone and sorry that the TSA agent didn't seem to care.  We go to Kindergarten to learn to stand in line and wait your turn.  Apparently this traveler did not learn that lesson too well.  Glad you made your flight in spite of things.", "ESH\n\nYelling doesn't help anyone. Should they have cut in line? No. But everyone knows that airport security is a nightmare, the agents are busy checking passengers and luggage not line managing - especially when it's busy. If they had done something it may well have slowed everything down even more. Let this be a lesson to always leave time for big lines at security.", "ESH, sounds like you didn't plan your day very well.

If you did not allow yourselves enough time to get thru TSA and check-in, that's on you for poor planning.", "If this is your \"mild\"...big yikes dude.

You also could have also asked to jump ahead in line, or you could have shown up to the airport earlier.\n\nFunny story, I was in a slow TSA Precheck line and time was running out. A couple behind me were panicked and livid about the slow-moving line, and were sure they were going to miss their flight. They were total AHs, but I let then jump ahead of me just to shut them up.\n\nI made it to my flight just in time to be called in Zone 1, and from my comfy seat I saw them get on ten minutes later with the zone 4 bunch.

At mine, people would ask security monitoring the lines about cutting to make their flight. That person would let them do it or not.\n\nSo aside from finding a person like that, your other choices would be to say to people who want to cut.

Line cutting rage is common and understandable. You were stressed because they were breaking the rules and putting you at greater risk of missing your flight. Calling the people in charge of the line was far better than taking the matter into your own hands. The busy-body behind you was a fool. You were all waiting in the line anyway. So you weren't delaying anything. The TSA guy was an AH. I'm sure that if you walked to the front of the line then and pushed in he'd have realized that he DID have authority to stop you. \"The TSA guy was an AH\" is not, I guarantee you, a line never before spoken.", "Yta depending on how much your family appreciated your tantrum and all the attention you invited on them. \n\nI had a dad who was a drama queen growing up.

I'm literally still on my drove home from the airport. We went to a family reunion! I have a 4F and 1F \n\nI have a lovely TSA story from Friday! This was ATL, btw. \n\nI used to be a flight attendant as well. \n\nFrom what I knew, you always take electronics out of bags and put them in the bins. So, with two small children, I was prepared and took them out while we were in the line waiting to go through security! Smart right? \n\nWell, no. Apparently you don't have to take then out anymore. The TSA woman behind the line where you put the bags was saying \"REMOVE SHOES, BELTS WATCHES. EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR POCKETS. ELECTEONICS STAY IN YOUR BAG\" \n\nI heard that and looked up at her and was like \"Oh wait, so they stay in the bags now?\" Just idk, yeah I heard her, but it was just a reflex to double check that I heard her correctly? This woman, oh my God. She looked me dead in the eyes and said \n\n\"REMOVE SHOES, BELTS, WATCHES. EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR POCKETS. ELECTRONICS STAY IN YOUR BAG\" \n\nIn this snotty ass tone. I feel your rage my man. I really do", ">Sounds like he planned his day just fine\n\nThe fact that it was even remotely close that this could be an issue shows they did not. Proper planning would not have seen them get to the gate with only minutes to spare.", "And if the people behind you are letting people cut in front of them, they clearly think they have time. It isn't your problem. Also, keep in mind that not everyone is familiar with travelling and may not be a good judge of how long things will take. The people trying to cut aren't doing it to inconvenience everyone around them; they genuinely feel like they don't have enough time. Travel is stressful and it's just better to give them a little empathy and grace. \n\nThat does not mean you need to let them cut in front of you. I think it's absolutely fair to tell them that you have an earlier flight so they can't go in front of you. Even if they had an earlier flight, I don't think it would be an AH move to politely tell them no. But that's something that only needs to be said once and it doesn't need to be said angrily or yelled. \n\nI also don't think they were in the wrong for not reacting to your anger and trying to diffuse it. Would you have preferred they started shouting back at you?  For my own self preservation, I would also aim to be pretty neutral and non threatening if someone was gearing up to confront me.
