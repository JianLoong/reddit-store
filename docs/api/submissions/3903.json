A lot depends on the individual child's capacity to be still and quiet. Please be kind to yourself and know that you're NTA for any part of this.", "NTA. Your mom should be more understanding about your concerns. It\u2019s not about being embarrassed it\u2019s about you wanting to be able to focus on your performance and remember it positively and frankly to be the star of the show with your band mates.

Your mom needs to realize that it isn't all about your brother. She wants you to think of him, but she is NOT thinking about the other performers (and you are). Your brother shouldn't be at that performance, whether or not he has special needs. Three year olds are a handful. Period. They have a ton of energy, and short attention spans. A school performance (which will easily be over an hour) will bore the crap out of ANY 3 yo. And when they are bored, they fuss, cry, and run around. It is disrespectful to the performers AND the audience to subject them to that. But you aren't going to change her mind or attitude.

This was me except my brother is only a few years younger than me. I've had multiple professional ensemble recordings ruined by my family.\n\nGo to your band director and explain the situation. Tell them that your brother will either be blasting a tablet or screaming and your mom does not care and that you would prefer if someone could ask your mom to take your brother outside when it happens because she's being manipulative and you're not in a position to deal with it. What your band director will/should do is get someone like a principal or other school official there on standby ready to escort her out when the noise starts. And do this for every school event you ever have until the end of time. \n\nSomeone other than you needs to make HER feel embarrassed for having no consideration for others. It's not a matter of being ashamed of going out with your family, it's a matter of them needing to be considerate of their environment and preparing your brother to exist in those spaces. He might not be ready for a few years if ever and that's okay, but your mother is not entitled to make others suffer around her. This goes for movie theaters, restaurants, etc, you should get up and quietly find someone when you run to the bathroom or something and warn them, ask them to leave you out of it, and let them prepare to handle the situation. This means the spotlight on the behavior is coming from someone else and she can't blame you.\n\nETA: this might mean she starts staying home and not coming with you because it can be difficult to leave a special needs individual with a sitter. And based on what you described, she will probably get nasty about it. That is not your fault or your problem and you'll have to decide for yourself if her being there causing a scene is preferable to being able to relax. I learned very early to be proud of myself without my mom or dad showing up or being supportive and I was lucky to have friends whose parents included me in their support. It's okay to be alone at events and enjoy the moment.", "NTA\n\nAt 3 years old (regardless of his diagnosis), he is too young to attend a concert.\n\nSince  your mother is unable or unwilling to find someone to keep him for a couple of hours, you will have to decide how important her attendance is to you.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA but as others have said. Parents with special need children often over compensate and are super protective, also she probably took it as an attack that he comes across as misbehaved, they can sadly be dismissive of the abled child. \n\nI think a way to have approached this without her getting defensive, or if you have the opportunity to explain it to her is, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want him there, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d love you to be there and present and us have a mother daughter grandmother day, this means a lot to me. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to go, perhaps your dad would like to?", "NTA\n\nIf your mom doesn't change her attitude, stop telling her/inviting her to events you know your brother will ruin.\n\nThis will suck because you want your mom there to support you.

It is perfectly valid to want some things that are important to you be about you and not your brother.  That obviously will not be the case if he's there.  Your mother and grandmother need to realize that there are two kids here and not just one and just because your brother is special needs doesn't make your needs less important.", "NTA.  It seems to me that your mom is overcompensating for your brother's condition by somewhat favoring him.  And of course his age alone would probably do that as well.  I think she was way out of line and even if she decided on the same end result, I think she definitely should have handled it much more sensitively toward you.\n\nETA:  Have a great concert!", "NTA (Hug)", "NAH.\n\nYou're not an asshole for worrying about a child being loud and making noise at an event that is important to you.\n\nYour mom *is* the asshole for how she spoke to you about your request.\n\nBuuuut she's not the asshole if she insists on being a package deal with your brother. If she feels that she needs to be with your brother at all times, then that's an assessment she's made as a parent on the needs of her young child, who unfortunately is much younger than you and can't be talked into understanding the situation like you can.\n\nI'm sorry that your mom is treating you that way; it really sucks. You're completely valid for not wanting your brother there. But if your mom says she can't come without your brother, then that might just be the way it is. It might not be meant as a punishment or ultimatum, it might just be your mom being stressed and not feeling like she can let anyone else watch your brother during the concert. \n\nYou wouldn't be out of line to try bringing up again that you'd really like for her to be there, but you're worried your brother will disrupt the concert, or that she'll miss big parts of it because she's focused on taking care of him.

Your mother and grandmother both are. The manipulation is sickening. Go to your concert and have a great time. See if you can spend the night with a friend so you can celebrate afterwards away from the 3 yr old and the manipulative grownups. (Grownups act like an adult but they're not. They do not like being held accountable for their actions, bad opinions, or handle difference of opinions. They're unable to emotionally regulate and allow others to live their own lives.) \n\nPerhaps it's as someone else mentioned, parents of disabled children overcompensate and often ignore community standards (like sitting still and not talking at a concert). Your mother allows her child to destroy the expected environment at events because she is selfish. Her needs take precedence over *everyone* elses. And any person who takes another person who is incapable of behaving appropriately at a venue is extremely rude. She ought to be put on blast for her behavior.\n\nA mother posted on AITA just recently about her missing her daughter's college graduation because her special needs son had a meltdown and she didn't trust the specially trained carer to handle the 18 yo boy. So mother wanted to know if she's the AH because her daughter has gone extremely low contact with her mother and the daughter made it quite clear that the mother has ALWAYS missed her events her entire life because the mother always chooses the son and the daughter will never ask her to attend anything else, ever. The daughter didn't even tell the mother she got engaged. The mother was designated the AH. \n\nYour mother may be going down the same road. Your mother will always insist your brother attend your events so be prepared to have every event interrupted or obviously, she'll be vindictive and not show up at all.\n\nYou could try a different way of addressing this issue. When an event is planned you could ask if brother would be interested in the event or prefer to be on his tablet? You could bring up that he could be overwhelmed by the noise, the large number of people, the lights and that the event would harm him. Or just straight up ask \"will his behavior ruin the event for the people around him? Isn't their enjoyment important?\"\n\nWhen you're an adult you get to decide who you want in your life. Who you want to support.

As someone who has spent a lot of time in the theatre (as a performer, a student, an usher, etc.), I can say with confidence that the majority of people exit the theatre when children inevitably do children things during a performance. This is just common courtesy and kind of a no-brainer. The kid gets the change in stimulus that they need (and learn that the theatre is a place for quiet), the audience can enjoy the show, and the performers can actually concentrate on it.

I\u2019m sorry your family are trying to guilt you for a reasonable and appropriate request. An environment with lots of people, lots of different noises and lights and an expectation to sit quietly it most likely the worst experience for your brother.

He'll be overstimulated and overwhelmed and then distract everyone else in the venue.\n\nThis has nothing to do with excluding your brother but actually looking out for him so that he doesn't get placed in an area that he can't cope with.\n\nPerhaps your grandmother can look after your brother at home so your mom can have some childfree time where she can focus on you.  \n\nAnd actually while I'm at it, she's not taking your needs into account.  It's all about your brother.  Yes he's young and neurodiverse but you are important too.\n\nAt the very minimum if your mother insists on bringing your brother, your grandmother can take him out if he's disruptive.\n\nThe other thing I can think of, is to speak to a teacher over what is going to happen of she does come with your brother.  Then when the ipad is up too loud or he's all over the place and yelling out, that the teachers can tell your mother that she needs to take him out as he's not coping.  But the danger here is that she'll play the disability card.  People will judge her if she does this and they will be annoyed but I suspect she won't care... but you will.\n\nBut I do wonder if you asked her what she is going to do when he annoys everyone around her and how she feels knowing that it's her behaviour that's caused the discomfort of everyone in the room.\n\nThis would make me want to move far, far away from home to go to college when you finish school and never come home.", "NTA, as a stage technician that works in high-school theaters, it's not worth it to bring a kid you know will be an issue. crew commonly has to go into house at intermission to ask loud parties to take a minute in the lobby, but the argument is always \"my kid is in this show, I'm not leaving\" , usually resulting in audio issues (loud kids) or other patron complaints!\nBreak a leg at your performance, hope this shakes out for you in the end :)", "NTA but your mother is. 1.

Mom should be looking for options to babysit so that she can give OP undivided attention, particularly (but not only) during situations like this. Failure to do so is failing at being a mother.\n\nAt some point mom will die.
