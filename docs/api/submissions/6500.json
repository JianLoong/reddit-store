He hasn't lost anything. That wasn't his daughter.  \n\nThis man for lack of a better word abandoned his child and didn't go to the funeral and you got the nerve to say NTA.\n\nGtfoh", "Pretty sure there's an r/amithedevil or something like that.\n\nEdit: lol someone already posted it there 30 min ago", "Wasn't that last year?", "Oh, I member dat, you member?", "I wonder if his logic is that he should be pitied because feeling guilty is like super hard.", "Something that mattered to someone when they were alive can still be honoured after they've died. And OP being there mattered to the people who are still living, like OP's son and ex partner.", "It is obvious it would have been useful for the living. Would have been less of an AH if he had showed up, and that's the point of it.", "Jesus fucking Christ. Your son is living and he wanted to go. But who cares about his feelings, right? I guess you are a pro at this point at letting down your kids. \n\nDon\u2019t be shocked if your current wife and son want to \u201cmove on with their lives,\u201d without you after watching this display of cowardice and callousness. But I guess now you\u2019ll bounce again before them, now that they know the type of man you are, huh? Pathetic behavior. Truly truly pathetic. I mean do you own mirrors, because how do you stand to look at yourself after everything you\u2019ve done to that poor girl in life and now in death? \n\nYTA. \n\nAll you wanted was to protect yourself from judgement. That\u2019s it. Dont pretend this has to do with anything else but your own pride and self preservation.", "It\u2019s probably for the best you showed your son what sort of person his father is. Putrid excrement is the answer.\n\nYTA", "Even you said \u201cI agreed to go, how could I not\u201d. It would have been nice to show your ex that you have a heart and cared that the child you had together was gone, regardless of if you were not in her life. \n\nYou can\u2019t spend your whole life mourning something you never knew? Dude you walked out when she was seven and she tried to get in contact with you no doubt you\u2019ve spent zero time mourning.", "\"Funerals are for the living\" ok so your ex-wife and son, who are the living people this funeral is for, don't rate consideration though? Your ex wife did something incredibly brave and selfless and compassionate by reaching out to you for the sake of both you and her daughter's memory. You threw it back in her face. Not to mention your own son. How many children are you trying to fail in your life? But of course you are the only person in the world whose feelings matter. Can't spend your whole life mourning something you never knew right? Can't even spend 1 day doing it, apparently.\n\nYTA. You didn't go because you're too cowardly to look your daughter's family in the eye, even after they graciously and generously extended an olive branch that you definitely didn't earn. And your response was to burn the branch. Your wife and son are never going to look at you the same now. Get comfortable with that because I doubt it's possible for you to fix it.", "Of all the excuses for asshole behaviour I have read on this page, this might be the most pathetic. Just pathetic and weak behavior all around, I am glad you showed your wife and son who you really are as a person.", "Why would anyone here understand that when your own wife now thinks you're a coward for not going? This isn't someone you never knew. You knew her. You knew her as that seven year old girl you so callously pretended didn't exist. You damn well knew her. That was your CHILD.\n\nYou're irredeemably self-absorbed. You abandoned that girl, pretended she didn't exist and now because you RIGHTFULLY feel guilty, you disrespect her memory by acting like she was a stranger.", "But you clearly don\u2019t care about the living either, not your ex, not your current wife, and not your son.", "Funerals are also to comfort the living who are going through the most grief.  \n\nHer mom is going through the most unspeakable grief you can as a human.  Nothing is more unnatural and tragic as a parent having to bury their child.  You couldn't take one moment out of your selfish existence to show up and offer her a scrap of kindness. Which since you rejected her daughter her entire life would have probably gone a long way in her healing. \n\nYou need therapy.  I don't feel you are mentally well.", "How can you let your daughter down like that even in death? I hope karma catches up to you. You don't deserve to live a good life. YTA.", "Why are people like you even allowed to populate the earth? You are truly beyond disgusting . Your daughter is better off that you weren\u2019t part of her life . I hope your son realizes how horrible you are and goes NC .", "Wow, this comment is honestly disgusting. If your own wife and son think you\u2019re a cowardly AH, you probably are. \n\n> I thought people here would understand that\n\nWe all understand that you\u2019re a complete AH who abandoned his own child, and couldn\u2019t even pay her the respect you have long owed her by attending her funeral.", "Something? Did you just refer to your daughter as something? I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll have a funeral with no one in attendance, because nobody alive will/should grieve your loss. You clearly only care about one person, yourself. So do your wife and child a favor and leave them too. Leaving seems to be the only thing you\u2019re capable of doing for those in your life. \u263a\ufe0f", "In theory your wife should know you better than a bunch of internet strangers, but from the info you've provided, you've let down your daughter over and over again, in life and now in death too, so you're feelings and guilt make perfect sense.", "As long as she was alive there was a chance he could make things right (or at least try to) but now that she's gone he has to deal with being the guy who abandoned her for her whole life. It's a loss even if he never knew her because now he never will.", "Ya know\u2026I think there\u2019s been a few with that premise now that I think about it. This one was like a couple weeks ago or something and she banned him from the funeral\u2026it was a ride", "I wonder if he\u2019s all \u201clook my wants and needs matter too!\u201d when he recounts this episode of sheer cowardice to friends.", "Who would it have been useful for? The ex who he abandoned who now very reasonably hates him? That seems\u2026 incorrect. \n\nYou\u2019re all letting your view of his prior actions color your decision on the fact that he didn\u2019t go to the funeral. He\u2019s a giant raging asshole for previous actions in his life, but dead people\u2019s feelings can\u2019t be hurt.", "His wife appears to have known he had a daughter he abandoned and she\u2019s with him anyway and had a kid with him. She knows he\u2019s TA but seems shocked at the extent of his TA-ness.", "\u00absorry you lost an opportunity you were never going to take\u00bb?", "It\u2019s not about his daughters feeling being hurt, it\u2019s out of respect for her.", "But everyone alive in his life have also been hurt by his actions. Funerals are for the living, and this guy just can stop disappointing.", "Specifically it would have been better for him, and him alone, and that's why the oportunity was offered, to be less of an AH. It is certainly not for the dead's feelings, but for her memory and how her image is preserved. When saying \"It is what she would have wanted\", it is implyied that she would have wanted her father to recognized her and do something positive even after she was dead, not for her but because she wanted a better father."]}
