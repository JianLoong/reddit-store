So she's calling you a bitch because she's jealous that you're doing better than she did at her age. If she can't be proud of you for that, she's the bitch, not you.", "NTA for spending your own money. Your mom's financial woes aren't your problem. \n\nStrong word of caution. As a young adult I had to hide a lot of the money from my mom because, if she got as much as she wanted, I would have never had the money to move out or become independent. Your mom no longer has a legal obligation to house you and it sounds like she's feeling increasingly put upon by doing so. If I were you, I'd squirrel away the package money into saving to get out on your own. Sooner rather than later.", "NTA, but since you are making money and you probably have a phone, if you aren\u2019t paying your own phone bill, why not take that off her as well. Ask her how much your portion is and roll it into the rent. This may not seem like a lot, but it\u2019ll go far for her. If you have a favorite food or drink, start paying for these items. This will help you understand how much money you need to set aside for groceries (for food anyway) when you decide to move out.

And that when she was my age she didn't have that and that's why she called me privileged and a b\\*tch.\n\nThe one being a bitch about here is, well... your mom. Just because she did not have the life that you currently have, does not mean she have the right to say those passive-aggressive comments. She should have been supportive and all. Just a suggestion, since your paying rent and all, I think you should entertain the idea of moving out.", "NTA. Your dad is right, you're an adult and as long as your financial obligations are taken care of you can spend your money as you see fit and your mom doesn't get to be a dick about it just because she's jealous.

You are paying rent and you are managing your life. I think it's time you start looking for another place to rent.

And even though it may not be cool for your mom to be jealous, she is only human I guess. You could be nicer about it maybe, contribute more to the household, treat her to something nice every once in a while.

''rent 12/2022''. ''my share electric bill 03/2023''. \n\nthis gives you tenant rights. if your mother 'snaps' and wants to kick you out, nope, not without notice, dear. \n\notherwise be her child, help around the house with chores, be family. perhaps even inquire what you would have to pay if you would live with roommates. you pay less? increase the rent money if you feel so inclined. you pay more? ups. this can of worms...\n\nso cya. if her jealousy becomes to much, if push comes to shove, being able to call the police to gain access to your paid for housing accomodation to a) live there untill end of notice forces you out and / or b) not collecting your personal belongings in a rush, thus forgetting some, can do wonders for you. it gives you a peace of mind money can't buy. its a secret ace in a poker play, a kind of uno reverse card (?).", "NTA: I'd move out.
