For the last 12 years or so, we've had a New Years tradition of getting together with the same group of friends.  Some years we rent an AirBnB and some years we just get together at someone's house.  We have only not gotten together one year (2020).  Even after having kids, we've found ways to keep this tradition going.  It's something I really look forward to as it's getting harder and harder to maintain friendships as we all get older, have kids, and become more entrenched in our own day-to-day lives.\n\nThis year, we weren't planning on doing anything outlandish.  We had planned to get together at one of our friends' houses about an hour from where we live and bring in the new year together.  My parents would be coming to our house to watch our kids for the night.  However, there is now a wrench in those plans.\n\nWe were supposed to get together with my wife's family last Saturday for Xmas.  But a couple of things derailed that.  First, her brother, SIL, and their 3 kids all got sick last week and told the family they wouldn't be making it.  Then, the weather took a nasty turn and a lot of roads in our area were closed.  My wife's mom and aunt (who would be hosting) decided by themselves that we would just reschedule for this coming weekend, New Years Eve.  There was no discussion, just a group chat sent out telling people that we would be getting together New Years Eve instead of Xmas Eve.\n\nAs soon as we got the text, my wife just assumed that we would be going to see her family instead of our friends.  She told me that I can call my parents and tell them not to come since we won't need them to watch the kids.  I told her I do not want to cancel on our friends since we've had these plans for months and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nShe told me I shouldn't be prioritizing seeing friends over seeing her family and that missing New Years for one year isn't going to be a big deal.  I told her that she knows how much this tradition means to me because these are life-long friends for me and this is one of the few times, if not the ONLY time a year that I get to see them all in one place.  I told her that if she is going to insist on going to see her family instead of our friends, then she can go alone.\n\nThat made her mad because she had assumed that we would just tell our friends that we can't make it because of our change in Xmas plans.  Due to her aunt's house being a 90-minute drive from our house in the opposite direction of our friends', doing both is not a realistic option.  My wife's family is getting together at 5pm so even getting to our friends' house by 10pm would be difficult and would require us to probably be the first to leave her family gathering.  \n\nShe is still trying to convince me to cancel on our friends, but I refuse to do that.  I want to see my friends and it's not my fault that her family rescheduled without asking if anyone had other plans.", "created_utc": 1672173074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwpat5/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_can_see_her_family/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't matter if you are seeing friends or staying under a blanket at home, you and your wife already made a commitment. The lack of communication on your wife's side of the family is what is causing the issue. It was very bold of them to assume that everyone would be available for New Year's. It's unclear if your Wife even asked them to reschedule for another time but it's the least she could have done.", "NTA - I am amazed at how many people discount friend traditions because they aren\u2019t related by bloodline.  These people whom we gather with by choice ARE family as well.  For your wife to completely discount your feelings on this, without discussion, is wholly unfair.  For her family to reschedule Christmas without ANY discussion is also unfair.  \n\nYou are NTA for wanting to adhere to your original plan.  But marriage is also compromise.  If your wife refuses any discussion and that it is \u201cher family or bust\u201d then I recommend you go to the friend event without her.", "NTA. Illness happens and weather happens but when you have to reschedule, you take it for granted that some people have existing plans and won't be able to make it.", "NTA. When someone unilaterally changes plans without discussing it to be sure everyone can attend the changed plans, it's to be expected that some people won't be able to come. It is rude to cancel plans you've already committed to just because someone else changes their plans.", "NTA this is a long standing tradition. They should have asked if people had plans especially that it is NYE. Why couldn't they make the plans for New years day so people could still keep new years plans.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to keep your original plans, the only one that sucks here is your wife for being mad about it.  I\u2019m sure her family would understand, and if not, they suck too. \n\nLife is short. spend time with your friends that you barely see. If not you\u2019ll be resentful, and your wife should give you a pass for this reason if nothing else.  Visit the family sometime soon.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with your choice here I truly don\u2019t get people saying ESH.", "NTA.\n\nCancel the sitter, the kids can go with with the wife to the fam's and you can go to NYE. Not everything has to be done together all the time!", "NTA - You haven't told your wife that she can't see her family, only that you won't be going.  With an event that was rescheduled without anyone checking people schedules, seems like a good solution.  \n\nThe only A H's here are the two that chose to reschedule without checking.", "nta", "Nta you are not stopping her from going to her family if you want to go to your friends thats fair and those plans were made first", "NTA. You already have plans for New Years Eve, keep them. See if you can do something with her family some other time.", "Oooh that's a tricky one\u2026\n\nI'd say your wife's family were definitely out of line rescheduling without checking first, because most people are likely to already have plans for New Year's eve and you can't just assume it'll work for them. If you'd had plans with your own family for instance it would have been a no-brainer.\n\nI don't think you're wrong for prioritising your friends over your in-laws in this specific instance. I also don't think your wife is wrong to want to prioritise her family, but she shouldn't have automatically assumed that you'd be fine with it as well.\n\nAll in all you each going where you actually want to go doesn't sound like a terrible plan as long as you can both make your peace with not spending New Year's Eve together. If you're handling this like adults neither of you needs to be the AH and you can both have a good time, separately or together. If one or both of you are throwing a tantrum or being passive-agressive to get your way that's a whole different matter.\n\nSo I'm going to go with a provisional NTA.", "If you make arrangements with other people to attend an event you do not then cancel them in favour of a subsequent invitation.  That is the height of bad manners and plain rude.  You wife, her aunt and your MIL are the AHs for even thinking that that might be acceptable.\n\nNTA", "NAH. You should each go to your preferred plans in good conscience. Couples don\u2019t have to do absolutely everything together every time.", "NAH just a difficult situation that is being handled poorly I think by both you and the wife. \n\nIf you have seen her family a month or so ago, not seeing them on NY seems acceptable. However, if they treat Christmas with your kids as a big event, you can understand why she wants to have a family experience with the kids.\n\nTbh I would ask if it is possible for the family thing to be a lunch and then drive to the friend thing in the evening or vice versa. The drive is not short but might be worth it for some domestic harmony. Try to find a solution other than you do your thing and I'll do mine and that is that.", "ESH\n\nYou're both adults here. SHIT HAPPENS in life including crazy weather and storms that have affected a lot of folks.\n\nBoth of you learn to COMMUNICATE and be flexible. Yes, it sucks to change plans but nothing should be absolutely written in stone.\n\nBoth sides assumed and didn't actually talk what the plans were going to be.", "Wait I\u2019m sorry I might be missing something. Your wife\u2019s family rescheduled because there was a massive storm that shut down a good portion of the country for days to a different weekend and you are upset by that? Would you have preferred they kept the time and demanded you come one way or the other because you have to stick to the plan? Seriously?\nYTA", "NAH.", "NTA but honestly sound like you could do both.  Tiring but possible. Stay with wife's family till 7:30 and then duck to go to friends.  Could even leave the wife with the family. You'll still be there in time for 10, being the starting time for the other.", "No AH's here. Your wife didn't get to see her family at Christmas, that sucks. You might miss out on seeing your friends, that sucks too. You both have very valid cases. This is not an AH situation, just a rock and a hard place.\n\nUltimately, you should keep your plans and reschedule Christmas. But be sympathetic to your wife's views that her immediate family are more important than *your* friends. If Christmas can't be moved, then she is sacrificing her choice to let you get your way. Be grateful. Be kind.", "You're in a tough spot for sure. Honestly, I think you should do both even if it is quite the drive. If both are important to you both, then bite the bullet and compromise.", "Esh, it sounds like you & your wife need to learn how to communicate.
