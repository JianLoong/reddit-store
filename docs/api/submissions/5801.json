For the last 12 years or so, we've had a New Years tradition of getting together with the same group of friends.  Some years we rent an AirBnB and some years we just get together at someone's house.  We have only not gotten together one year (2020).  Even after having kids, we've found ways to keep this tradition going.  It's something I really look forward to as it's getting harder and harder to maintain friendships as we all get older, have kids, and become more entrenched in our own day-to-day lives.\n\nThis year, we weren't planning on doing anything outlandish.  We had planned to get together at one of our friends' houses about an hour from where we live and bring in the new year together.  My parents would be coming to our house to watch our kids for the night.  However, there is now a wrench in those plans.\n\nWe were supposed to get together with my wife's family last Saturday for Xmas.  But a couple of things derailed that.  First, her brother, SIL, and their 3 kids all got sick last week and told the family they wouldn't be making it.  Then, the weather took a nasty turn and a lot of roads in our area were closed.  My wife's mom and aunt (who would be hosting) decided by themselves that we would just reschedule for this coming weekend, New Years Eve.  There was no discussion, just a group chat sent out telling people that we would be getting together New Years Eve instead of Xmas Eve.\n\nAs soon as we got the text, my wife just assumed that we would be going to see her family instead of our friends.  She told me that I can call my parents and tell them not to come since we won't need them to watch the kids.  I told her I do not want to cancel on our friends since we've had these plans for months and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nShe told me I shouldn't be prioritizing seeing friends over seeing her family and that missing New Years for one year isn't going to be a big deal.  I told her that she knows how much this tradition means to me because these are life-long friends for me and this is one of the few times, if not the ONLY time a year that I get to see them all in one place.  I told her that if she is going to insist on going to see her family instead of our friends, then she can go alone.\n\nThat made her mad because she had assumed that we would just tell our friends that we can't make it because of our change in Xmas plans.  Due to her aunt's house being a 90-minute drive from our house in the opposite direction of our friends', doing both is not a realistic option.  My wife's family is getting together at 5pm so even getting to our friends' house by 10pm would be difficult and would require us to probably be the first to leave her family gathering.  \n\nShe is still trying to convince me to cancel on our friends, but I refuse to do that.  I want to see my friends and it's not my fault that her family rescheduled without asking if anyone had other plans.", "created_utc": 1672173074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwpat5/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_can_see_her_family/", "score": 814, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These people whom we gather with by choice ARE family as well.  For your wife to completely discount your feelings on this, without discussion, is wholly unfair.  For her family to reschedule Christmas without ANY discussion is also unfair.  \n\nYou are NTA for wanting to adhere to your original plan.  But marriage is also compromise.  If your wife refuses any discussion and that it is \u201cher family or bust\u201d then I recommend you go to the friend event without her.", "NTA.

If you'd had plans with your own family for instance it would have been a no-brainer.\n\nI don't think you're wrong for prioritising your friends over your in-laws in this specific instance. I also don't think your wife is wrong to want to prioritise her family, but she shouldn't have automatically assumed that you'd be fine with it as well.\n\nAll in all you each going where you actually want to go doesn't sound like a terrible plan as long as you can both make your peace with not spending New Year's Eve together. If you're handling this like adults neither of you needs to be the AH and you can both have a good time, separately or together.

Your wife didn't get to see her family at Christmas, that sucks. You might miss out on seeing your friends, that sucks too. You both have very valid cases. This is not an AH situation, just a rock and a hard place.\n\nUltimately, you should keep your plans and reschedule Christmas.

Maybe it's just a so-so tradition for her.\n6. So both of you should have talked like a team (the team that a husband and wife are supposed to be). Weigh things: Does her whole family get to meet with yours multiple times a year? Are the friends really mainly your friends? Is this really the only chance to see all the friends for a year? Might her family be receptive to delaying a week if wife would only say something? Would you both be OK if wife and kids went to see her family while you attended the friend party?
