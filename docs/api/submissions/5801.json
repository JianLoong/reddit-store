For the last 12 years or so, we've had a New Years tradition of getting together with the same group of friends.  Some years we rent an AirBnB and some years we just get together at someone's house.  We have only not gotten together one year (2020).  Even after having kids, we've found ways to keep this tradition going.  It's something I really look forward to as it's getting harder and harder to maintain friendships as we all get older, have kids, and become more entrenched in our own day-to-day lives.\n\nThis year, we weren't planning on doing anything outlandish.  We had planned to get together at one of our friends' houses about an hour from where we live and bring in the new year together.  My parents would be coming to our house to watch our kids for the night.  However, there is now a wrench in those plans.\n\nWe were supposed to get together with my wife's family last Saturday for Xmas.  But a couple of things derailed that.  First, her brother, SIL, and their 3 kids all got sick last week and told the family they wouldn't be making it.  Then, the weather took a nasty turn and a lot of roads in our area were closed.  My wife's mom and aunt (who would be hosting) decided by themselves that we would just reschedule for this coming weekend, New Years Eve.  There was no discussion, just a group chat sent out telling people that we would be getting together New Years Eve instead of Xmas Eve.\n\nAs soon as we got the text, my wife just assumed that we would be going to see her family instead of our friends.  She told me that I can call my parents and tell them not to come since we won't need them to watch the kids.  I told her I do not want to cancel on our friends since we've had these plans for months and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nShe told me I shouldn't be prioritizing seeing friends over seeing her family and that missing New Years for one year isn't going to be a big deal.  I told her that she knows how much this tradition means to me because these are life-long friends for me and this is one of the few times, if not the ONLY time a year that I get to see them all in one place.  I told her that if she is going to insist on going to see her family instead of our friends, then she can go alone.\n\nThat made her mad because she had assumed that we would just tell our friends that we can't make it because of our change in Xmas plans.  Due to her aunt's house being a 90-minute drive from our house in the opposite direction of our friends', doing both is not a realistic option.  My wife's family is getting together at 5pm so even getting to our friends' house by 10pm would be difficult and would require us to probably be the first to leave her family gathering.  \n\nShe is still trying to convince me to cancel on our friends, but I refuse to do that.  I want to see my friends and it's not my fault that her family rescheduled without asking if anyone had other plans.", "created_utc": 1672173074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwpat5/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_can_see_her_family/", "score": 460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These people whom we gather with by choice ARE family as well.  For your wife to completely discount your feelings on this, without discussion, is wholly unfair.  For her family to reschedule Christmas without ANY discussion is also unfair.  \n\nYou are NTA for wanting to adhere to your original plan.  But marriage is also compromise.  If your wife refuses any discussion and that it is \u201cher family or bust\u201d then I recommend you go to the friend event without her.", "NTA.

I also don't think your wife is wrong to want to prioritise her family, but she shouldn't have automatically assumed that you'd be fine with it as well.\n\nAll in all you each going where you actually want to go doesn't sound like a terrible plan as long as you can both make your peace with not spending New Year's Eve together. If you're handling this like adults neither of you needs to be the AH and you can both have a good time, separately or together.

Your wife didn't get to see her family at Christmas, that sucks. You might miss out on seeing your friends, that sucks too. You both have very valid cases.

Do they often do this kind of thing without talking with others  when making plans? Your wife making assumptions, and bending to their will, without talking to you about it first is also a problem. Does she often do this? Do the two of you talk about boundaries with each other's families to balance both of your needs? Because that's what this really is, a boundary issue. If your wife has issues setting boundaries with her family, you've got bigger problems!", "NTA\n\nThis seems weirdly planned! If I had been sick and had to reschedule I would be adamant about making it easy for everybody! \nAssuming you will drop everything you had planned is not reasonable! Every year for the last 20+ years me and my best friend (and later other friends) have religiously celebrated Halloween. Nothing have made a change in this and my gf have huge respect for it. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nCall up the family and make them reschedule for next weekend if they wanna hang.", "Yes, especially for NY's Eve!", "New years day is for recovery", "Tbh I bet she\u2019s mad bc she wants to go to the friend event but doesn\u2019t wanna hear it for missing. Doesn\u2019t want hubs to go have fun when\u2019s she won\u2019t. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude05", "I don't think wife's family was out of line. There were illnesses and a big storm making it unsafe for people to travel, so the hosts bumped it back a weekend with the hope that most would still be able to make it. That's pretty typical.", "If the wife goes to her parents house to celebrate Christmas on NYE of course she would bring the kids. That\u2019s the whole point! \n\nHe only needs a babysitter if his wife joins him at the friends house.", "Why does he have to be the one to make the compromise? His plans were made months in advance, his wife's were made days. NTA", ">Sometimes sh*t happens, and you have to make compromises for the people you love. \n\nBut his wife doesn't have to compromise for him right?", "I\u2019m going back to my home town to visit for the holidays and my mom has unilaterally decided I\u2019ll be spending all my time with my parents. I have friends that still live there (which she obviously knows) that I\u2019ve already made plans with, and I\u2019m actually staying with my parents will I\u2019m there, but not once have I been asked what my plans are for when I\u2019m there. It\u2019s crazy to me that she thinks she gets to dictate how I spend all my time.", "I once snuck back to the East Coast to spend a weekend with my high school best friend (who had just given birth) because I knew my mom would be pissed I was using my vacation to visit someone other than her. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Except for these weekends in particular. Most people - parents included - have plans on New Year's Eve. Rescheduling to then requires checking in and being flexible; maybe Xmas is in January this year.", "No not more important, but certainly no *less* important! Friendships ARE important.", "That's not true. She always planned to see her family. She has planned to spend the holiday with her family all her life. For good reasons beyond their control, those plans needed to be adjusted, but they did not change. Now, it is a matter of priorities. \n\nSo, let's do the math. Her family is important to her. Her family is important to his children. Her family is more important to his wife and his children than his friends.\n\nHis children and his wife are important to him. His wife and children should be more important to him than his friends. \n\nThis is a compromise he does for because it is important to his family. That is what being adult is. That's being a good father and a husband.\n\nNow he can always decide that his wife and children are not his priority and he can spend New Years with his friends instead. His wife will know how important they are to him. Then I wouldn't be surprised to find out that he suddenly has lots of free holidays to spend with his friends in the future. Every second holiday to be sure...", "No, the circumstances have changed, and now she has to prioritize. Her family and children vs. their friends. \n\nI think it would be pretty f*ck up to choose her friends over her family and kids. But hey, that's just me", "I think the wife would take the kids. By alone OP probably means without him, not completely by herself.", "Because according to OP, getting to their friends by 10pm would be difficult and would mean they might have to be the first people to leave the family gathering.", "Because of their ages they will require supervision.  Probably why uer rather hang with friends then look after his kids at his in laws", "But OP won't be going to the family gathering in this scenario."]}
