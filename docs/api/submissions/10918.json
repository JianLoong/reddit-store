Context: On our floor there are multiple bathrooms, one of them a gender neutral/disabled bathroom. There isn't anyone who is physically disabled in our floor. All our bathrooms have two toilets and two showers, but the ones in the gender neutral/disabled bathroom are bigger. One of the showers is even bigger than the other, and has a seat that you can sit on. \n\nNow, on Mondays I have class from 8 am to 7 pm with only small breaks in between, so I'm usually exhausted by the time I come back after class and dinner. When I get really tired, my left shin starts hurting BADLY. Like, a bone deep pain that doesn't get worse or better until I sleep it off. Anyways, last week my Monday was even worse because of events other than my classes, and my leg started hurting around 5 pm. Two hours later it was still hurting badly, but I managed to quickly eat and come back. I was going to shower and go to bed. I decided to use the biggest shower in the disabled bathroom, because I needed to sit on the seat. Anyways I'm sitting there and showering, when someone knocks really loudly on the bathroom door. I said that I would be out in a minute, and conitnued to shower, but they continued to knock. So I finished up my shower quickly, put on my towel, and opened the door. \n\nThere was this one girl there and our RA. The girl looked really mad, and she basically started shouting at me for using the disabled shower when I wasn't disabled. The RA just looked kind of confused, so I explained that I was using this shower because my leg hurt really badly and I wanted to sit. The girl interrupted me to ask if I was disabled, and I said no, so she cut me off and started shouting at me again. Finally the RA was just kind of like \"mind your business to her\" and told me to use the facilities that were meant for me but she just seemed anxious to leave so I don't know. She left, and then the girl kind of gave me a dirty look and left too. \n\nIt's been almost a week since then but I've been thinking about it a lot because it really rattled me.

It's insane to leave a perfectly good facility unused just because it's accessible, especially when none of the tenants have a disability. It's there so that people who need it can shower comfortably, just as you needed it to be able to shower comfortably.", "So is the shower, a much needed resource, supposed to just sit empty? Never to be used? I thought a handicapped stall/shower could be used, as long as a person with a disability has priority use.", "NTA. But I would see your doctor about the left shin.  That\u2019s not a normal symptom of tiredness at your age.  I have that problem in my right leg but I am 50 and have severe arthritis in my ankle so the pain radiates upwards.  Also, your doctor can likely give you a note for being temporarily disabled at times due to pain.  If there is no one that is disabled on your floor it shouldn\u2019t be an issue but keep in mind that not all disabilities are visible.", "NTA. Those showers are designed for people who can't stand up in the shower.\n\nAt that moment, you were a person who, because of your pain, could not stand up in the shower.\n\nSo you were using exactly the right shower. The person who gave you hell about it was herself being extremely ableist, because she was making assumptions about your ability based on how you looked. Not all disabilities are visible. Invisible disabilities deserve to be treated as valid.", "NTA - accessible bathrooms aren\u2019t reserved exclusively for disabled people they are just made accessible. You would only be TA if there was a person with a disability who needed the bathroom and other bathrooms were available to you", "NTA\n\nProtip: You're *mildly* disabled. Difficulty walking for long periods counts. \n\nSounds like shin splints to me\n\nGirl needed to mind her business. Not her fight at all", "No one disabled was using the shower, those utilities aren't meant just for disabled people. They're not like handicapped parking spaces. What are you to do if all the showers on the floor are filled save that one? Not use it because it's not \"meant\" for you? The RA was being a noisy busybody. NTA.", "NTA since you were actually in pain. You may not have had a long term disability but you were, at that moment, disabled from standing up without pain. That's a legitimate reason to use that shower, especially if there is literally nobody else who needs it.", "NTA. Sounds like you have a busybody with too much time on their hands on your floor. Keep using that shower and please have that leg looked at you could maybe get help for that.", "NTA.   \nWith caveats. I am assuming while there\u2019s no disabled people on your floor, there\u2019s also not a large number of transgender, and therefore queues forming for this bathroom, and that you weren\u2019t in there for a very long period of time.   \n\n\nI am of the camp that if no one is needing to access the accessible space then others can use it, and it sounds like you had a particular reason to use it so it was reasonable. The RA has the measure of the girl. Have you heard of the story of the Boy who Cries Wolf. Don\u2019t stress about the yelling girl, she\u2019s going to cry wolf so many times that she\u2019ll be ignored.", "Assuming that the person knocking wasn't someone entitled to use the shower more than you then I really don't see a problem. NTA, some people just like being awkward", "NTA. That girl yelling sounds like TA.", "NTA.  You mention you needed to sit. So you had a reason to use it.", "NTA. Disabled bathrooms and shower facilities are not legally protected spaces like parking lots. They are handicapped accessible, not handicapped only.", "NTA there is nobody living there that needs to use the disabled person shower. It does seem that you have a busy body problem at your dorm.", "Given that nobody else appeared to have any need to use the facilities, it's hard to see what harm it causes for you to be able to shower while sitting down and avoiding making the pain in your shin even worse.\n\nAnd since there're plenty invisible disabilities, and the other girl doesn't know your personal circumstances, I'm going to say NTA and she needs to butt out.", "NTA\n\nBut please go have your shin looked at.  It sounds like you are developing an actual injury due to shin splints.  This can be an easy fix, by finding the right kind of support.  Like orthotics or different shoes.  Not taking care of it, you can end up with a more serious issue like a stress fracture or deep tissue injury.\n\nYou can also argue, given the leg pain, you are temporarily in need of additional accommodation, to include sitting down while showering.  It is the same as if you were actually disabled, because you are in a condition that requires additional help.", "NTA. Nobody is disabled on your floor. It's something meant for those who have disabilities, but as long as you're not getting in the way of someone who it's meant for, you shouldn't be harassed for using it from time to time, especially if you have a reason to use the amenities provided.", "NTA. Was the girl trying to use the shower too? Otherwise, why was this any of her business? You weren't \"disabled\" but you had a medical issue that made use of the shower with the bench much more comfortable. That's what the shower is there for. You are allowed to use it. \n\nIf someone living with a greater disability might need the shower, then it's polite to make your use quick, but otherwise, I see no problem.", "When you have certain injures (like yours), you\u2019ve become temporarily  disabled -NTA.", "NTA. Can you see a doctor on campus sometime soon about your leg? I also just wanted to reaffirm that there are likely disabled people on your floor who have invisible illnesses or injuries, but of course not all of us need every resource all the time (and you deserve to have accommodations for your pain as well).", "NTA. But also any time I\u2019ve seen disabled stalls/showers, they weren\u2019t exclusively for disabled people. Of course that might vary based on state/country/school, but based on the RAs reaction, it\u2019s not an exclusive thing.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you have an issue with pain that you try to manage. It may not technically be a \"disability\"- but it DOES mean you need an accommodation. And that disabled shower is, you guess it, an accommodation.\n\nI do have to ask- is the girl who was yelling at you disabled and wanting top use the shower? Or was she (and pardon me here, but I am disabled and I fucking hate people like this) the kind of abled asshole who does things like this for brownie points but would refuse to let me have a seat on t he train because I \"don't look disabled enough\"? Because I would be willing to bet money that she's the latter.\n\nShe needs to mind her fucking business. She has NO WAY of knowing if you are disabled or not, and I am, honestly, looking forward to the day that she tries this shit on a disabled person who, like me, has had it up to HERE with abled people trying to police how we go about our lives.\n\nAlso wanted to edit and add that, even if you don't have an \"official diagnosis\", if this issue with chronic, recurring pain continues to happen and impacts your ability to do things in your daily life... Then yeah. It actually probably falls under \"disability\". The ADA defines disability (in the legal sense) as \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more life activities\". For example, my asthma is a disability because it limits my life activities (how fast I can move, how much I can push my body physically, it limits where I can go because too many stairs isn't good for me, etc.).", "~~INFO: was the girl who got angry disabled?~~\n\n**NTA** \nThere was no one with a disability who needed that facility at that time. And it sounds like you had a decent reason for needing it anyway, pain in your leg making it difficult to stand is a really good reason to use a shower with a seat accommodation. And this girl who got angry and brought the RA in was being a huge busybody. It sounds like she\u2019s figuring out her activism still, which I see a lot in younger college students (I have taught college and I currently teach HS seniors). She\u2019s sort of testing the activism waters and figuring out how to be a voice for a cause. Accessibility for disabled people is very important, and had you just been using it for some extra space and making actual disabled people wait, that would be pretty messed up. But that wasn\u2019t the situation. You\u2019re fine.", "Huge NTA", "NTA, at that time, in the moment you needed the features of the bathroom. The bathroom served it's purpose of allowing better access.", "NTA. Pay that girl no mind, she's being incredibly petty.  However, do be mindful of not making it a habit. You had a legit reason. Also, I'd see a doctor about that shin pain.", "NTA - Are the other washrooms also gender neutral? This might also be a point of contention for them but is also a reason you're permitted to use it.", "NTA. It is kind of silly the way showers are often reserved for disabled people when there are no disabled people are even likely to use them.\n\nThe fact that you were injured really does give you the right to use an empty disabled shower I feel", "NTA - She got a serious condition mentally, you got a serious condition physically. She copes by being over the top, misunderstanding and socially and empathically unbearable. You cope by using a space created for people that you don't stop from benefiting from it as they don't exist in your cosmos. So...she would be the asshole even if you just wanted to use a bigger shower for comfort.", "When you say that nobody is physically disabled, is that because you know these people well enough to have a reasonably informed view, or is it that you've assumed people who you've never talked to do not have any disabilities based on watching them? Not all physical disabilities are obvious or even visible, e.g. some people may walk reasonably well but struggle with bending motions. It sounds like you needed to use it at the time, so leaning N T A, but depending on how you answer the above I might suggest not making a habit of using it.", "NAH\n\nNormally I would say Y T A for using the disabled facilities but you were injured. So usually yes you would be a total a-hole for using the disabled bathroom/shower but in this one case you needed to sit down. \n\nI think you should probably see the campus clinic about your knee. In case you actually do have an injury that would put you on the disabled list.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
