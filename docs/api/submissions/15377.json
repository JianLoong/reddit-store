Every grocery trip, I have to buy a new bottle of shampoo, and it\u2019s not cheap. Why? I\u2019ve told him several times to stop using my shampoo, but he\u2019ll do it anyways. Well, I finally had enough after about the fifth time I told him to start using his own. Before he took his shower, I told him for the last time \u201cStop using my shampoo, it\u2019s getting way too pricey for us to be buying a bottle every grocery trip,\u201d which of course he brushed me off. 15 minutes later, he strolls out. Lo and behold: he smells like a bouquet of goddamn roses. I started getting onto him for using my shampoo again, but he just laughed at me. So this is where I think I may be the AH. I told him, \u201cEnough is enough. You need to man up and start buying your own, I\u2019m sick of running out, and I\u2019m not sharing my damn shampoo anymore.\u201d He sulked for the rest of the night, and didn\u2019t sleep in bed with me that night. So, AITA for telling my husband to man up?\n\nI think I might be because he is my husband, and I should just share with him. I just hate the fact that he uses SO MUCH that I run out quickly. I\u2019ve had showers where I had to skip washing my hair because he finished off a half-full bottle in one go.\n\nEDIT: We have separated finances and he makes a lot more money than I do. I buy my own shampoo. He has very long hair and showers/washes his hair daily, and i have very short hair and shower/wash my hair once every three days.\n\nEDIT #2: I told him to \u201cman up\u201d as in he needs to buy himself a bottle instead of taking mine. I don\u2019t care if he smells like flowers at all, I love flowers and everyone deserves to smell like however they want.", "created_utc": 1682126712, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12upyac/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_man_up_after_he/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
