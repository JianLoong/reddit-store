I wouldn't have bothered.\n\nClearly she is your mothers fav child and your need to have a peaceful relationship at all costs, is the only reason you're even entertaining any of this. You know your mother will give you grief no matter what happens.\n\nIts no bad thing you're living far away from the bride and her new life (it sounds like she is having her wedding where she is now living?)  Anyway - engaging with these people who put you last even at your own wedding - you can walk away from them.\n\nSend them Christmas cards in future.", "NTA, it doesn't sound like she wants them there anyways.", "NTA. \n\nIt's not 100% clear why you're going. Sister sounds - difficult. Is your mother always so controlling?", "I am not sure here. Your sister sounds entitled and so do you.\n\nThe weirdest part in your post is the one about destination wedding, while you also mentioned it's where they live. Just for your information, getting married where you live is literally the opposite of a destination wedding. \n\nA destination wedding is a wedding that's not held where the couple lives. Guests having to travel doesn't make it a destination wedding.", "Honestly, ESH.  Your sister sucks because she sounds really tiresome. It sounds like your whole family gives into her, so they all suck for feeding her entitled behavior.  Having her boyfriend in your wedding was your choice.  You caved to her demands but really can't expect an entitled brat to treat you equally well.  It's just not in their nature.  So, you suck for having that expectation and for being miffed that your baby is not in the wedding party.  Who has a baby in their wedding?  I am assuming he is under 3 since you referred to him as a baby.  Really, even having a 3- or 4-year-old in your wedding is rather iffy.  Finally, you would be the A if you \"phone in sick\" like you mentioned in one of your additional comments.  You said you would be in her wedding, and you need to keep your word.  If you don't want your husband and baby to go because of the expense and the hassle of traveling with a baby, that is fine.  But dropping out now is petty and puts you on your sister level.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA.  You're not obligated to fly your family across the country at great hassle and expense just so people can get pictures at someone else's event.  \n\nMy ILs always wanted the kids around for photo ops but never wanted to put any time into the relationship with them at any other time, and honestly, life is too short to be a photo op for people who can't be bothered the rest of the time.", "INFO: How old is your son? You refer to him as a baby but seem offended he wasn't asked to be ring bearer. My 3.5 year old nephew was ring bearer at my wedding recently, and was only just old enough for it. (He was ring bearer a year before at a different wedding, throw a tantrum during the service, had to be taken out by my brother, and someone had to chase after then to retrieve the rings!) I can understand her wanting a (presumably) older child for this.", "NTA - even without all of your drama points, you have very good reasons for your husband and son to not attend.  Just stick to the cost and travel issues with a baby as your reasons if anyone asks.\n\n\"I know, I wish they could be here too, but we simply cannot afford 3 plane tickets right now.  Plus this means we don't have to board the dog, which actually saves us an additional $1200.\"  \"No, I'm not willing to force my XX-month old son to be in the car for 13 hours.\"\n\nReasonable people will understand.", "NTA is it the path of least resistance? Is brining your husband and son going to be much more expensive if you are already paying for the room for yourself? I\u2019d be inclined to bring them to have as support but if it\u2019s easiest for you to just go alone do that.", "NTA. Please don't stress over \"ruining photos\"! If family photos at the wedding were important to your sister she would have included your husband and son in the party, wearing attire that coordinates with everyone else. Fact is, if your immediate family were to travel to the wedding and be in the photos, the photos would still reflect how they were left out of the wedding party. Really, it's too bad her husband-to-be is in YOUR wedding photos! Do what you feel is in the best interest of your immediate family. And, be thankful for the buffer of the 13-hour drive between you and sister.", "NTA I honestly don\u2019t know why you even agreed to be a bridesmaid. \n\nI would just go without them. When asked why they are not there just say they could not make.\n\n\nI would also suggest finding you a therapist so they can help you learn to set healthy boundaries and cope with their guilting until you do this you will always do their bidding even if it disrupts your whole household.", "Pretend hubby and baby are going. Then fake a baby illness last minute (not too drastic, just no good for a wedding) and say you \u201chad\u201d to leave baby behind and of course hubby had to stay and how sad.\n\nDrama avoided. NTA!", "Weddings are so full of ridiculous pointless expensive drama. I don\u2019t know why people bother. I ran off for a stress-free wedding with my hubby, and regret nothing. I won\u2019t attend weddings now. It\u2019s an intimate lifetime decision between two people, attended by 400 people? So weird and archaic. Anyhoo, NTA.", "NTA.", "Taken alone it would be an asshole assumption, but I think it's valid to be exasperated that someone who threw such a massive tantrum during your wedding planning until she was allowed to shoehorn her boyfriend into the wedding party isn't reciprocating that favour or appreciating it in any way.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Don't get into a conversation with them.\n\nYou could say it seems as though your son was developing an ear infection and everyone knows that you really can't fly with an ear infection as the pressure and pain is enormous and the plane would've been turned around and you kicked off and wouldn't have made it at all if your son was really distressed!  Can't really argue with that on the day.", "If you do, I recommend claiming either *Campylobacter* or *Bacillus cereus* food poisoning -  not infectious, but  projectile evacuation from both ends, which should mean that no-one wants to push you and kiddo to join the festivities!", "Norovirus is sweeping through daycares right now\u2026 claim you caught it and best part is since it\u2019s a quick virus you can say it was over in 18 hours - don\u2019t even have to pretend to be sick for long!\n\nEnjoy the time off with your son and husband instead, traveling that far for a wedding you don\u2019t want to be at sounds miserable. NTA", ">My husband and son are invited to both ceremony and reception party (not rehearsal dinner on Friday though)\n\nAll of the other stuff that's been mentioned and poor etiquette too.\n\nIt is good wedding etiquette to invite out of town guests to the rehersal dinner  Though, when practically all of the guests are out of town guests, that can become a little inpractical. Some downsizing would be understandable.\n\nHowever, this should not go to the point of excluding the spouse and child of members of the wedding party. Heck, even if you were living in town, it would be somewhat rude to be excluding your husband from the rehersal dinner. (in that scenario, arguments can be made either way about including kids)\n\nNot sure its worth bothering to call her on this particular breach of etiquette, either now or down the road. Particularly since your plan is for them to stsy home. Better to just shrug it off as yet one more way that she's being petty and count your blessings that you live far, far apart and don't have to deal with it on a daily basis.", "Sounds rude and entitled. Also: this trip is a burden. NTA, save your money", "She cares about what other people think and the aesthetic of family photos", "Don't you just love it when guilt tripping families try to dictate what you have to do with your time and money? Seriously. You're an adult with a husband, a child and a dog - that's not including the possibilities of a job, rent/mortgage, car payments, daycare bills, etc. Your mother sending you a freaking bill for the hotel and demanding that you attend on her terms smacks of someone who needs to hear the word \"no\".
