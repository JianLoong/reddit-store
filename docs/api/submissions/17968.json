It sounds like your whole family gives into her, so they all suck for feeding her entitled behavior.  Having her boyfriend in your wedding was your choice.  You caved to her demands but really can't expect an entitled brat to treat you equally well.  It's just not in their nature.  So, you suck for having that expectation and for being miffed that your baby is not in the wedding party.  Who has a baby in their wedding?  I am assuming he is under 3 since you referred to him as a baby.  Really, even having a 3- or 4-year-old in your wedding is rather iffy.  Finally, you would be the A if you \"phone in sick\" like you mentioned in one of your additional comments.  You said you would be in her wedding, and you need to keep your word.

I can understand her wanting a (presumably) older child for this.", "NTA - even without all of your drama points, you have very good reasons for your husband and son to not attend.

If family photos at the wedding were important to your sister she would have included your husband and son in the party, wearing attire that coordinates with everyone else. Fact is, if your immediate family were to travel to the wedding and be in the photos, the photos would still reflect how they were left out of the wedding party.

Heck, even if you were living in town, it would be somewhat rude to be excluding your husband from the rehersal dinner.

Seriously.

It might be time to accept that this is just who your sister is. She\u2019s petty, immature, and doesn\u2019t respect you. You can choose how you and your husband/baby will show up.

If my husband could pick, he\u2019d say none of us go and we send her a $5 check. I know he\u2019s being dramatic because she\u2019s been pretty mean to me but it\u2019s less about her and more about the family photos I\u2019ll be ruining for my grandparents and parents. I\u2019ll go because I committed and to keep the peace with my parents, but I won\u2019t ask my husband and son to go.", "My guess, and really it's a shot in the dark, is that your son's involvement would pull you away from your \"bridesmaids duties.\"\n\nWhen my daughter was a flower girl, it was a pretty big job for me. I wasn't in the wedding party (it was my husband's cousin getting married) and thank goodness. Trying to get a 4 to ready, clean until the ceremony, and engaged for photos took all my attention. \n\nPhotos were super cute though.", "You should stay home and turn off your phone. They don\u2019t care about you, they want perfect aesthetics of a happy family for pictures. Tell them they can photoshop your family in. Since they made your wedding all about what your sister wanted, you\u2019ll be making her wedding work for your family by staying home. \n\nDo you really want to travel for a major guilt trip?", "Please don't go. It's not worth it. Plus losing money to have a miserable day is a no go for me.", "Well, I flew transatlantic with an 18-month old to go to a wedding, so what I would do is go to the wedding. I'd fly rather than drive: the 18-month-old in question hated the car seat with a passion, so all day in a car seat wouldn't work. \n\nI find large \"wedding parties\" completely ridiculous, so that nonsense wouldn't bother me - but that's a personal preference.\n\nYour real problem here seems to be that you don't like your sister much, and she doesn't like your family much. And in that case, I'm not sure it matters very much whether the wedding is half a day's journey away, or just round the corner: you don't want to go to much effort for the sister that doesn't like you. Ultimately, this is your choice, but do recognize that you will be choosing for your family not to show up at a \"major family occasion\", which will tend to increase the separation between you and your wider family. You get to decide whether that matters to you.", "NTA for having your husband and son stay home.  My guess is that the flower girl will not cooperate.  That is really too young for that short of thing.  If things go wheels off with the flower girl, you can be thankful that your son was not included because your sister would probably blame you and your son.", "Can I just say having a tiny flower girl and ring bearer be pulled down the aisle in a wagon would be ridiculously adorable? That sounds like the cutest thing and a great family moment in any wedding.", "You will eventually have to start putting your husband and son first instead of bending over for your family when they don't reciprocate.\n\nNTA, good luck", "That\u2019s a great one.\nAnd if they say then drive\u2026 driving with a sick child aint no good eather. So\u2026 f them en let your hubby bond with your son over a nice father and son weekend.\ud83e\udd23", "They guilt trip you to come to the wedding and pay a lot of money and lose a day of work. They will blame you if the perfect happy family pictures are incomplete and they will go after you, if you don't attempt the wedding at all.\n\nYou have nothing to win here\n\nBUT\n\nyou also have nothing to lose.", "I assume you mean autistic spectrum? Your other sister may well be perfectly happy with the situation and have no interest whatsoever in being part of the wedding party, but autistic people in general aren\u2019t immune from feeling left out, and can be very aware of when it\u2019s happening."]}
