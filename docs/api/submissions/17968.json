Don't give any reason and just get on with the business. It looks like no matter what you do, your sister will come up with some drama and this way you can be prepared for it.

I understand shes your sister but it doesnt sound like she and perhaps others in your family really treat you very well.", "INFO\n\nWait a minute - you describe yourself as having a \"baby\", but then complain that your \"baby\" wasn't chosen as a ring bearer.\n\nHow old is your \"baby\"? Nobody gives babies roles in weddings, because they're babies: their role is to be held and look cute. You say that your cousin's son \"isn't much older\", but at a young age, even a few months of age difference is a lot in terms of the capability of the child.", "NTA honestly,  I wouldn't even go. She did enough to mess with your day, I'd dropout and go LC", "No she doesn\u2019t like my husband very much anymore, but that\u2019s 100% her fault and a long story. I think she loves my son, but I can\u2019t figure out why she didn\u2019t pick him.

I do think it will be best for them to stay at home. Traveling at my son\u2019s age is just super hard.", "That is a good word for it. I just hate that I\u2019ll be letting down more than just her, but it\u2019s probably for the best.", "Oh my petty self would go and openly call it a pre-divorce party. They want to guilt that hard, they can get the full show for which they paid.

Maybe I could just phone us all in the couple of days before as sick?", "She didn\u2019t make him a groomsman like we did for her fianc\u00e9. Basically she got to talk down the aisle of my wedding with her bf, but I don\u2019t get to walk down the aisle of her wedding with my husband. It\u2019s also not like they were hard pressed to find equal numbers or something.

Good luck, OP.", "My husband keeps joking he\u2019ll skip this one but attend her next wedding so this comment made me chuckle. The guilt is definitely too real with my family, so I appreciate the 3rd party judgement.", "Then spend time with your kid, may be use the money you were going to spend on a spa day.

Thank you", "She\u2019s on the spectrum so I don\u2019t think she quite understands how it looks to everyone else. She\u2019s just happy she can wear pants instead of a dress and I think that was how it was sold to her."]}
