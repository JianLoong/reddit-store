It sounds like your whole family gives into her, so they all suck for feeding her entitled behavior.  Having her boyfriend in your wedding was your choice.  You caved to her demands but really can't expect an entitled brat to treat you equally well.  It's just not in their nature.  So, you suck for having that expectation and for being miffed that your baby is not in the wedding party.  Who has a baby in their wedding?  I am assuming he is under 3 since you referred to him as a baby.  Really, even having a 3- or 4-year-old in your wedding is rather iffy.  Finally, you would be the A if you \"phone in sick\" like you mentioned in one of your additional comments.  You said you would be in her wedding, and you need to keep your word.

I can understand her wanting a (presumably) older child for this.", "NTA - even without all of your drama points, you have very good reasons for your husband and son to not attend.

If family photos at the wedding were important to your sister she would have included your husband and son in the party, wearing attire that coordinates with everyone else. Fact is, if your immediate family were to travel to the wedding and be in the photos, the photos would still reflect how they were left out of the wedding party.

Heck, even if you were living in town, it would be somewhat rude to be excluding your husband from the rehersal dinner.

Seriously.

It might be time to accept that this is just who your sister is. She\u2019s petty, immature, and doesn\u2019t respect you. You can choose how you and your husband/baby will show up.

I\u2019ll go because I committed and to keep the peace with my parents, but I won\u2019t ask my husband and son to go.", "My guess, and really it's a shot in the dark, is that your son's involvement would pull you away from your \"bridesmaids duties.\"\n\nWhen my daughter was a flower girl, it was a pretty big job for me.

And in that case, I'm not sure it matters very much whether the wedding is half a day's journey away, or just round the corner: you don't want to go to much effort for the sister that doesn't like you. Ultimately, this is your choice, but do recognize that you will be choosing for your family not to show up at a \"major family occasion\", which will tend to increase the separation between you and your wider family. You get to decide whether that matters to you.", "NTA for having your husband and son stay home.  My guess is that the flower girl will not cooperate.

Why are you even going?  Why are you even speaking to her? She sounds utterly insufferable.", "NTA - To be honest I am not completely sure why you are even going, considering her treatment of both your spouse and your child.\n\nJust because she is a blood relative, doesn't make her \"family\".

It's an invitation not a summons.\n\nIf you don't want to take the time off, don't want to travel with a child, don't want to spend the money, then say \"no!\"  Don't give a reason - it's really none of their business.

It sounds awful.", "NTA. I don't even know why you're going.", "NTA and stop letting your family run over you. They didn\u2019t make you do anything.  You chose to be a doormat and agree to them.

He is NOT dramatic, he is reasonable.", "Again, these are two different issues: wedding attendance and being absent for extended family portraits. How your sister behaved towards your family has no bearing on how your relatives will feel about your family being absent from pictures. \n\nThe more important and special these pictures are to family members, the more you\u2019d be an asshole to them and your own family for bringing everyone else into the crossfire of your sibling drama. \n\nYou WILL have to lie to various people on the day and after. It might not be your intention to complain, but if these pictures will be displayed, you WILL have to explain their absence for the foreseeable future, and likely to your son when he wonders why everyone is there but him and dad. \n\nAnd only you can say how much the rest of your extended family will be disappointed or hurt by their absence from the wedding and pictures, and if this would be an issue, if that fallout is worth it.", "Gotcha   .I didn't understand.

How old is this baby? I had a 1yr old as a ring bearer. It didnt work. I also had my sister as a bridesmaid but i wasnt one in hers. Maybe your sister doesnt want you to take all the attention.

I'm handicapped due to an accident and while I can walk I can't do things like hiking, and I won't do things like beaches because of extensive scarring due to accident. So what do they both want to do? Either go to a beach or go camping with lots of hiking. When I asked what I was supposed to do they said they'd get an Airbnb instead of a hotel so I could enjoy staying at a house.
