Body shaming in any form is unacceptable regardless of who started it.", "ESH. Obviously.", "ESH but this made me laugh! \n\nI was a twig growing up and I got so sick of one lady (she was an overweight adult, I was a teenager) telling me to eat more burgers. One day she told me \u201cyou really need to gain weight!\u201d And I snapped and said \u201cwell you should give me some of yours then!\u201d I get how constant ribbing can drive you to saying something mean back but I still think about that and feel like I could have approached it differently.", "ESH you both sound like toral AHs. Clearly reporting her was an option so why not do that?", "ESH- y\u2019all need to have a serious talking to about not commenting on other\u2019s bodies no matter what next time she tries report her. Don\u2019t stoop to her level of insults", "ESH - how about nobody bullies anybody?", "ESH", "ESH. Getting nasty and body-shaming anyone is wrong, even if they did it first. You didn't tell her weight loss would do her good. You called her fat and implied she was ugly.", "ESH. Both of you should grow up and stop commenting on other people\u2019s bodies.", "ESH!!!", "ESH. ALL body shaming is wrong.", "ESH. Imo there are people who look better with a bigger body. Not everyone is made to be thin or even average. Her comments may come from a place of insecurity and she's projecting. Your response is a result of having enough listening to her being mean to others.", "Esh. I'm sure you've heard the expression \"two wrongs don't make a right.\" You were trying to make a valid point but went about it wrong. Rather than trying to PROVE your point with retaliation, try explaining. \"Wow Jane. That was wildly inappropriate and hurtful. It's never ok to comment on somebody's body. I know you wouldn't like it. Please don't ever do it again.\" Making her feel actually guilty as opposed to just bad about herself is better justice anyway.", "ESH - all body shaming is wrong.", "ETB. Are you 12?", "ESH. Neither of you were right.

Body shaming is a two way street", "Esh", "NTA - That made me laugh! She shouldn\u2019t have started it if she can\u2019t take it when it\u2019s thrown back at her. Also it sucks that it\u2019s okay to criticise a thin person\u2019s body but it\u2019s not okay to do it to a fat person. The double standards are ridiculous", "ESH", "ESH", "Lol NTA. Everybody can do with a lesson in FAAFO.", "ESH\u2014and not because you fought back. Her behavior is unacceptable. But, because of how you did it. \n\nActing catty with inappropriate clapbacks like that is for girls who love drama, not girls who are confident and putting someone rightfully in their place. \n\nJealous girls (or anyone, but in this context) are toxic and crappy no matter what they look like or what shade they try to throw at you. The content doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s their behavior. They\u2019ll dress it up in whatever skin they want. \n\nTheir problems are with themselves, not you. \n\nEveryone wants to say \u201clet\u2019s not comment on bodies\u201d like that\u2019s the issue here. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s that girl\u2019s behavior toward others. \n\nYou want to win? The next time she says something crappy like that, wrinkle your nose at her, look her dead in the face, and say, \u201cPlease stop. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself\u201d with a look of pure secondhand embarrassment. If other people are around, it\u2019ll be 1000x more effective. \n\nThat isn\u2019t \u201cplease stop being mean to me\u201d it is \u201cplease stop, I feel bad for you\u201d in tone. Like she\u2019s a child that\u2019s misbehaving and her inappropriate behavior is making everyone uncomfortable\u2014because, let\u2019s be clear, it is. \n\nGuarantee she bursts into tears. 9/10 times, they do that when you flip the script on them like that because it\u2019s so dismissive and they wanted to feel powerful by getting a reaction, which you\u2019ve denied them. When you make them feel small, they shatter. \n\nIt\u2019s like Mushu said: \u201cplay nice with the other kids, unless, of course, one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid\u2019s butt.\u201d\n\nWhen you address her, be serious and even a little like you pity her. Don\u2019t be rude, aggressive, overly condescending, or emotional. \n\nOther options include: \n\n-Why would you say that? (Serious, not accusatory) \n\n-You know everyone talks about how uncomfortable it makes us when you speak like that, right? \n\n-Do you want to talk about why you feel such a need to talk about everyone else\u2019s bodies? The team has been talking, and we\u2019re concerned. \n\n-When you say stuff like that, you sound really insecure. Do you want to talk about it?\n\n-I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but you have upset a lot of girls by speaking like that. I thought you should know before you ruin your reputation with the team even more since people are already talking. \n\nOr\u2026and we didn\u2019t have this one back in my day, but I bet it\u2019s positively lethal:\n\n-That\u2019s not very body positive of you. Can you explain why you think some bodies are beautiful and others aren\u2019t? \n\nI can assure you that there is no bigger way to shut up catty girls then to talk to them like you\u2019re an adult and they\u2019re a child. Works every time. \n\nWorst case, she avoids you out of embarrassment. Best case, she gets humbled and starts being a decent teammate. \n\nIf she cleans up her act, don\u2019t be a jerk. Some people need hard lessons before they understand how to be a part of a group.", "YTA. You should have reported her behavior and had the adults deal with it.", "ESH both of you should apologize to eachother and your teammate to all people in the team that where insulted/shamed from/by her.", "ESH. But maybe now she\u2019ll shut up about other people\u2019s bodies.", "YTA, she sounds like an asshole too, but you took it a step farther with the insult. You could have stood up for yourself without the insult I think", "YTA but so it she\u2026 no one should make comments about another person\u2019s body", "Seriously?! Of course YTA. She obviously is too but what the actual f*** makes you think it\u2019s ever okay to say what you said to someone?! Shame on you, you are just awful.", "YTA. She is too.

You should be talking about how concerned you are about her chances of injuring herself. Additional weight isn't on your side when you twist/roll an ankle. \n\nBetter would have been to report so they would only have to deal with 1 girl body shaming others instead of 2.", "EHS for body shaming. \nYour comeback tho, straight savage lol", "NTA, she got a taste of her own medicine. 10/10 on the clap back. Disagree with the ESH votes Self defence / returned fire is not bullying/shaming. Op just maintained the context.", "NTA. you just gave her a taste of her own medicine", "NTA. For some reason people are saying ESH? When was allowing another person bully you a good thing? Always clap back and put them in their place, everybody ignoring is just going to make her comments worse.", "NTA she asked for it.", "NTA , she shouldn\u2019t have commented on your appearance if she didn\u2019t like it being done to her .
