Or letting her jump on everyone because she \"just wants to give loves\" and gets offended and/or pissed if anyone has issue with it. Or like.. giving her table scraps directly at the table after I've asked him to stop multiple times because now she begs constantly because \"she just wants the good foods\". It even goes as far as I can't even ride shot gun in his truck without this dog on my lap because that's \"her spot\" and she will whine if she isn't in the front seat. Now all of this is his fault. Her bad behaviors are 100% him because he is the one enforcing it because he has small dog complex and thinks the dog is incapable of being in the wrong. \n\nThe one thing that truly bothers me to no end though is the fact that she will pull my clothing out of my drawers and lay on them, versus lay on her dog bed. She sheds like crazy so even in the event of washing my clothing there is still dog hair on it and it drives me mental because I would love just one day where I'm not being poked with dog hair or smell like dog to the extent of which I do. I've asked my fiance to grab my clothes from her if he sees her take them and he just refuses. So last night when I got home from work I noticed that he had taken my pull over and put it on the floor for her (it was hanging up), as well as my throw blanket that I sleep with every night (despite her having her own blankets) and when I asked him about it, he said something to the affect of \"she missed you and only stopped whining when I gave her something with your scent on it\". \n\nAt this point I was just so fed up with my boundary on this being crossed so I grabbed my 3 suitcases from the outside storage and packed up all of my clothing so the dog couldn't get to it and put locks on them (the small cheap locks you get at Walmart for like $2). Now my fiance thought I was leaving so he immediately starts freaking out and when I told him I was simply packing my clothing away so he would stop letting his dog sleep on my stuff, he got frustrated and said that I was blowing this up. That I'm going to have dog hair on me regardless and that this is \"stupid\" and \"childish\" because I'm taking away from the dogs comfort simply because I don't want anyone touching my stuff.

This would be the end of my relationship.  He loves that dog more than you and shows it.", "NTA. You set your boundaries and asked him repeatedly to respect them.

The day came where my dads boundaries where crossed to the point that he said, \u201cit\u2019s either me or the dog\u201d with the dog meaning teaching it to properly behave and being stricter with it.

What if you have a baby? How will you ensure keeping baby safe?! Your relationship isn\u2019t as great as you claim. If it were, your fianc\u00e9 would care about you. You need to open your eyes.

All because he wants to baby it instead of treating it like a dog. Dogs need to be treated like dogs, otherwise they don't know how to react in social scenarios and they can wind up hurting themselves. That's not even taking all the other bad behavior into consideration, but like... Some kid is going to take something and the dog's going to go after it and nip and you bet that parent is going to give more of a crap over their actual child than his dog."]}
