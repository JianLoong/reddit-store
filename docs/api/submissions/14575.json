I personally believe MLM\u2019s ruin relationships with friends and family. Case in point, a few years ago my marriage was struggling after I found out my husband had been cheating. I was mentally, physically and emotionally broken. People knew this as I had shared my struggle with friends. I had great support from them, except one. The day I told them, she popped up in my DM\u2019s saying she knew what would cheer me up. Scentsy. I was appalled. I didn\u2019t even know what to say to her so I just didn\u2019t respond. SHE KEPT MESSAGING ME. She even text me asking to host a party saying how it would lift my spirits. I blocked her on everything. When I saw her in person, she flat out ignored me but had zero issue telling people how she tried to reach out and help me and I was ignorant towards her. I would find out years later she attempted opening an actual shop in her garage that cost well over 10 grand ( not exaggerating). It failed and it put her own marriage in turmoil because she couldn\u2019t get rid of the products. This also happened to another friend trying to start up one of the clothing MLM\u2019s\u2026another one over 10 grand and that also caused massive problems between her husband and her friends when she wouldn\u2019t stop harassing them to buy stuff.
