Turns out it was Bianca.\n\nI asked her to stop and she did, except she spent the whole night trying to talk people into the business. In the grand scheme of things, what Bianca did was insignificant because my wife and I were very happy that day and there were no major problems, but I still get angry when I think about how uncomfortable it must have been for the guests who were subjected to her presentation. Fortunately, they graciously accepted our apologies.\n\nEvery time my wedding is mentioned, someone is sure to mention my crazy sister who was promoting her MLM. So incredibly embarrassing. Bianca and I haven't had a lot of contact since then.\n\nYesterday my mom called me and after a bit of catching up, she told me that my sister's business hasn't been doing very well and she's been struggling to meet her monthly cuotas so now she's behind on rent and needs money.

She embarrassed me at my wedding, she didn't even apologize and I was absolutely sure she was going to use the money I gave her to get into another MLM now that this one was no longer working for her.\n\nMy mom said that I'm cruel and rude. She said that she did not raise me to betray my family.
