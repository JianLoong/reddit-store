Me and my wife have since the birth of each one of our kids put in monthly payments in a college fund for them. The amount in the funds was enough to cover for all four kid\u2019s college education. \n\nOur kids all choose different paths in life, wether it was their degree, place of education or what type of school, they all went with something different. \n\nWhen our oldest, Chloe graduated high school, she talked to us about how she was unsure what she wanted to do with her life and had been thinking about taking a gap year. We talked with her and told her it was her choice, that if that was what she wanted she should do it and not rush in to education. She did take 2 years, during these years she worked and in an agreement with me and my wife payed us 250$ in rent each month to continue living with us. She still ate our food, we cooked for her and still bought her necessities. The 250$ were put in a savings account that we gave her access to when she and her now husband was beginning to talk about buying a house.\n\nEven though the situation was not the same with each kid, they all knew about this and the plan for how the money would be used. Wendela lived with us for 3 years after college, Emily lived with us during college. They both took part in this. The issue is with my son, he like his oldest sister wanted to take a gap year. We encouraged him to do so, he asked if he could stay with us. We told him yes, but told him about the rent situation. He was not happy with this, saying that he was our son and we should want him to live with us for how long he would need to. We explained what the money would be used for, he said he did not give a shit. He was very angry with us for a long time and ended up staying with a friend of his.\n\nThis all happened around 8 years ago. We have a good relationship now with both him and his wife whom are excepting our first grandchild. He recently brought up how all his sisters got money to buy a house, showed me pics of a house that he and his wife had been looking at. I said it looked nice, to which he responded with asking when I could give him the money. I told him that he made a choice when he was 18 and that he would not receive any money, he said that it was unfair and that he was young and dumb and should not be punished for it. I told him that I did not have that kind of money to just give him.\n\nHe left the house after arguing a bit more, my wife and his sisters all are on my side. However his wife and my mom have said that I am in the wrong and I should want my grand baby to have a place to live and should not punish him for mistakes he did as a young boy.\n\nAITA for not giving him the money?\n\nEdit: When each kid got access to the rent money, it was in a savings account. However, before it was put in a fund so the money grew. Explained it really bad, sorry.", "created_utc": 1699229241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17oprlx/aita_for_not_giving_my_son_the_same_opportunity/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just gave everyone the same opportunity. Live here pay rent then collect it when you need it. Your son chose not to live with because he didn\u2019t want to pay rent. Therefore he has no savings put aside for a down payment.", "NTA. I'm using the title for this one. It's not like you didn't give your son the same opportunity (because you did). It's about being responsible for the choices you make in life. Imagine how your daughters would feel if they had to pay rent only to see your son get some money just because. They are called savings because it doesn't grow on trees.", "NTA \n\nHe was legally an adult when he made his choices at 18. He was mad at paying rent to you, knowing full well that the rent money would be put aside for him to use later. He split. \n\nHis actions have consequences and instead of being mad at you, he should be mad at himself. \n\nNo one gave me the money to buy my own house. I did it by working hard, getting my credit scores up and saving money. Apparently he doesn't think he should have to work for it. He thinks everything should be handed to him on a silver platter. \n\nHe has some growing up to do. Hopefully, his grandma (your mom) won't hand him money for a house.", "NTA. I wish my parents did that for us too. Lol.", "ESH - you provided for 3x of your kids because they followed the life choices you wanted for them. Your son felt entitled and wanted to do things his way as a spoiled 18 year old. You had the money if he had done what you wanted.\n\nThe goal of saving that money for them was to provide a jumpstart for a better life for them via college (or otherwise it was still for their FUTURE). Why does he deserve any less towards his future than your other children?\n\nEdit to add. This was before realizing that the OP had already given son the money from the fund for college and that he then went to college. That changes my opinion to NTA. Your son is entitled and needs to grow the F up.", "NTA\n\n\"should not punish him for mistakes he did as a young boy.\"\n\nWhat about when your daughters were the same age and made the opposite decision? They are apples to apples and he's come out rotten. \n\nNo, you're not punishing him for making one choice. You rewarded your daughter for making a different choice. What you did was positive reinforcement for commendable decision making. Your son doesn't get positively reinforced because his choice wasn't commendable.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong. Those who say you are want him to freeload off you and are using fallacies in their arguments.", "NTA.  He doesn't get to benefit from a program he didn't put into.  His siblings participated in the program which makes me assume he truly understood how it worked, and was just a young adult who was more interested in instant gratification than saving.\n\nWith respect to his MIL, she's welcome to give them a gift for the purchase of a house.  He's a married grown man who presumably planned to have a child, he can figure out a living situation for themselves.", "He got his money for college. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to his sisters to then give him money he didn\u2019t deserve just because he\u2019s the only boy. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou had the same deals available for all your kids. I think its a genius move. You taught them the value of education, the importance of paying their own way in life, and were able to help them more than most parents can. \n\nYour son was ungrateful. He had the right to choose his path and made his decision. You didn't punish him then and you're not punishing him now. He could have done the same deal as his sisters.\n\nHow does he not understand that all you did was collect rent money from his siblings and then gave them that money back at a later date? It didn't come out of your pocket. He expects you to cough up your own money for him when he gave you no money so none was saved for his future.", "NTA\n\nHe could have paid you \u2018rent\u2019 which was essentially just forced savings, but chose to move out (and presumably pay actual rent elsewhere).\n\nYou can\u2019t give him money you don\u2019t have. You\u2019re not \u2018punishing\u2019 him for his choice - his choice has the very real consequence that you don\u2019t have his \u2018rent\u2019 money set aside for him to now use.\n\nI do feel like there\u2019s missing info with him choosing to limit contact with you after this, but based on what\u2019s here, NTA.", "NTA - You did give him the same opportunity to enter into the home smart saver scheme of Mom & Dad. Your son opted not to invest in his future by putting his savings into the bank of Mom & Dad. \n\nIf he'd been smart, he would have been putting that same money elsewhere, but we all know he didn't. \n\nYou're not treating him any different to his sisters now. You are contributing to his home the grand total of his contributions to your home smart saver scheme - nothing. \n\nThat was his risk to take.", "NTA at all. From what I understand, you never GAVE the other kids money. You just kind of held on to their own money and gave it back to them lol. Dude should have taken your offer. If you're looking to adopt any more adults, I can 100% do that rental agreement with you lol", "NTA\n\nSo the money they gave you as \"rent\" you basically just diverted it to a savings account for which they would just use in the future for their own house\n\nSo he didn't contribute anything into this savings account and somehow he's expecting money to come out of where? \n\nIf you gave him money out of your pocket, then surely all your other kids are then entitled to ask the same, since the money they gotten so far was their own money back. They then need to get a lump sum from you just because you've given one to your son? \n\nOut of principle, he's not due any money", "NTA You can't give what you don't have.\nThese are two different situations.  Out of curiosity, did he ever go to college, and did you pay for some or all of it?", "Why did you give the others money for houses if they used it on education the same as your son?", "What happened to the money you put aside for him since he was born/what are your plans for it?", "You still take $250 a month renters . Sign me up new dad", "NTA\n\nYour son seems to think he is entitled to the benefits without compensation, the way you and your wife have set the rules for your childrens is excellent I think and now he simply reaps the results of his own choices.  \nGiving in to his request is like disregarding the efforts made by the others three.\n\nFurthermore, knowing that these accounts were made with the rents paid by his sisters he could have saved this money himself, but he chose not to do so.", "NTA.  They got $$ from you that they had paid for rent.  He decided not to live with you, didn't pay the rent, and therefore there is no $$ for him.", "NTA. Unfortunately he was young and dumb and wasn\u2019t able to realize the benefit he was losing. We all see better in hindsight. If you want, perhaps consider gifting him an amount based on what you *didn\u2019t* spend on him (food and necessities) that you *did* spend on your daughters during their \u201cgap years\u201d. \n\nFor example, if a daughter paid rent of 6k over 2 years while living at home (that you saved in an account for her), but you spent approximately 100 per month for those same 24 months on her living expenses, and for the same 2 year period in his life your son didn\u2019t cost you that 100 per month because he wasn\u2019t living at home, than maybe consider gifting him $2,400 toward his down payment.\n\nYou\u2019re certainly not obligated to and wouldn\u2019t make you TA either way, just a thought.", "NTA\n\nPlus, wouldn\u2019t it be very unfair to his sisters if he did receive money?", "NTA. He was young and stupid\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have the money now.", "NTA", "Nta your son made his decision,  now he can live with the consequences.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is super entitled. He was that way during the gap year and he\u2019s that way now. You aren\u2019t punishing him for his choices, life is. He could have taken his own money and put it away (assuming he wasn\u2019t paying rent when living with his friend). \n\nYou gave him a supportive and kind option to help set him up for the future. It\u2019s not your fault that he decided not to take it, and that he\u2019d rather blame you than take responsibility for his actions.", "NTA. You gave your daughters back THEIR MONEY that you grew for them. He refused.", "NTA. HE made the choice that he did not want his money set aside and saved for his future, this is the result of that choice.", "NTA. What money is he looking for if he spent his money on his education?", "NTA- there is literally no money to give him. Whoever says you should give him money can donate to the cause.", "NAH/INFO\n\nEveryone else thinks he's an asshole, but I don't think he is in this situation, nor do I think you are one either. \n\nHe's just trying to plan ahead, and try and put him and his family ahead in life, so he came to his parents for help. While it does sound like you might be holding that choice against him, you're not obligated to help him, but if you can afford to help him a little bit, why wouldn't you?", "NTA  \n\nYour daughters put that money in the house savings funds. He decided not to do it\u2026 there\u2019s no money. Money does not magically appears. He was trying to pull a fast one.", "NTA\n\nYour son isn't being punished instead his sisters worked hard and got rewarded. Just because he's not being rewarded for doing nothing is not the same as punishment. He's getting exactly what he worked for.", "NTA.  Is there any debate? You can help with diapers and other expenses to support the family, but the son made a big mistake and will have to pay.", "NTA he cannot use his age as an excuse for the choices he made when his siblings were the same age and made better choices", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t give anyone money, you forced them to save money. He chose not to do that. And if you simply don\u2019t have that money, it seems it\u2019s a moot point entirely. It\u2019s weird your wife wouldn\u2019t be on your side here. \n\nAt 18 I joined the military to get away from my father (who admittedly, sounds as financially controlling as you), and now I have benefits from that decision, and a few demons that follow me around as well. You\u2019re not punishing him, he\u2019s just learning that his adult decisions have long term consequences.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sorry I don\u2019t really understand", "That was money that his other kids paid in rent when they chose to stay with their parents either before, during or after college. Son didn't want to live with his parents and pay rent (even though he knew that rent would later be returned when he needed to make a big purchase later in life) so he moved out.

We firstly opened up another fund and put the money there. When they first started talking about buying a house, we emptied it, put it into a savings account then gave her access to it. So the amount was more, in total she paid us 6,000$ total that was put in ti that.\nBit of a complicated process but worked well.\nSo when she got access to it, it was in a savings account", "He already has received his", "I am confused. Where do you see favoritism? His sisters paid rent, and then received their rent money in return. He didn't really 'give' them any extra money or preference...

Do you have no actual idea how much your son\u2019s education cost?", "You explained this horribly so people think you gave them extra money on top of their college fund.", "Then NTA\n\nThe money you put aside has been used for its intended purpose.\n\nLike someone else has said, it wasn't extra money the other kids got it was their own money returned to them after an investment.\n\nYour son isn't being punished but dealing with the consequences of his actions, even if it's 8 years after he made the choice.", "Oh then you don\u2019t owe him anything else. Maybe offer him a spreadsheet of the deposits and withdrawals on the accounts so he can understand that when he was an adult he had the choice to stay with you and follow your rules (pay into his fund) and he chose not to do so. You sound like great parents and I\u2019m sorry your son is making you feel like you failed him.\n\nEdit: to be fair with all your kids, if you gave him extra, you\u2019d have to give them all extra, and that\u2019s not what you budgeted. If he needs down payment money, perhaps he could ask his sisters for a loan or whatnot. Good luck!", "After our argument when he was 18 he stayed very low contact with both me and his mom. He contacted us about a year later, telling us that he needed his college money as he had gotten in. We fixed it all, he got full access to it.

So no, I truly do not have any idea how much his education costed him.", "Yikes, going low/no contact is overly extreme and I seriously doubt this is the first spat you guys had if he stopped talking to both you and your wife for close to a decade. \n\nInstead of asking him and being open to maybe helping them (even with $1000) you chose to throw in his face something he did at 18 which completely severed your relationship, did you think that would go over well? \n\nI hope you had no plans on being a grandad because you have yet again ruined whatever little relationship you had with your son.\n\nAll this makes me wonder how and if you and your wife even tried to improve your relationship at all.", "WTF?!?!\n\nThe kid was acting like an entitled AS. They STILL have him his college fund, and now he's looking for more money.\n\nAbsolutely NTA"]}
