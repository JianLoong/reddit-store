It's not like you said it that way with intent to hurt his feelings, but more out of pure shock that he was doing something so lazy and detrimental to the rabbit's health because he \"didn't want to have to shop for different food\" for different animals with different dietary needs.", "NTA. It's crazy and shocking enough to cause your first reaction to be what it was.\n\nIt's not diplomatic, but it's not hostile, either. It's an expression of disbelief.\n\nBrother is calling you hostile to distract from the magnitude of his blunder.", "NTA he's trying to kill his rabbit, you don't need to be polite", "NTA rabbits are not carnivores.

As in stupid?\n\nRabbits don\u2019t eat dog food. Period.", "NTA, it should be pretty obvious that a omnivore and a herbivore have different diets. Please check in with the rabbit to make sure he's actually feeding it rabbit food and not just carrots. Carrots are a treat food because they are high in sugar.", "Pretty sure feeding meat to herbivores is how we ended up with Mad Cow Disease.", "Wait, your brother didn\u2019t know that dog food is meat?", " Honestly why are you posting about this? Just say \u201coh ok I\u2019ll try to be more polite next time\u201d and move on. Seems like he\u2019s willing to listen to you and move on but just had a minor concern about how you were speaking to him.", "NTA but he was more stupid and lazy than crazy. Good on you for paying enough attention. Poor bunny.", "Rabbits (some rabbits) will voluntarily eat meat. There are even examples of rabbits killing birds and eating them.", "Going nuclear right off was wrong, you should have told him how stupid the idea was in a different way. He accepted that he was mistaken and said he would change the diet. If it makes you feel any better for the rabbit (but not for the dog) cheap dog food is mostly grains with only a little meat in it.", "YTA in that your method lowers the chance of him actually doing the right thing for the rabbit and isn't that the goal?\n\nWhen you take the approach you did there is a potential for him ignoring you completely.\n\nInstead a \"hey, it can be confusing but it's not healthy. Here's some articles that confirm it's not good for rabbits.\"\n\nIf he continues then go nuclear.\n\nAnyway at this point I'd apologize for the approach but firmly and gently press that you're concerned and want him to change the food he buys.", "That\u2019s how you breed carnivore rabbits", "YTA buy an Xbox.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
