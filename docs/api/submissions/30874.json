It's not like you said it that way with intent to hurt his feelings, but more out of pure shock that he was doing something so lazy and detrimental to the rabbit's health because he \"didn't want to have to shop for different food\" for different animals with different dietary needs.", "NTA. It's crazy and shocking enough to cause your first reaction to be what it was.\n\nIt's not diplomatic, but it's not hostile, either. It's an expression of disbelief.\n\nBrother is calling you hostile to distract from the magnitude of his blunder.", "NTA he's trying to kill his rabbit, you don't need to be polite", "NTA rabbits are not carnivores. He needs to bring the rabbit to the vet. You can't feed a rabbit dog food. It needs rabbit food", "NTA. If someone in my family did that I\u2019d straight up ask if they were stupid or evil?", "Why would you be an AH for pointing out your brother is a bit special? As in stupid?\n\nRabbits don\u2019t eat dog food. Period.", "NTA, it should be pretty obvious that a omnivore and a herbivore have different diets. Please check in with the rabbit to make sure he's actually feeding it rabbit food and not just carrots. Carrots are a treat food because they are high in sugar.", "NTA\n\nPretty sure feeding meat to herbivores is how we ended up with Mad Cow Disease.", "Wait, your brother didn\u2019t know that dog food is meat?", " Honestly why are you posting about this? Just say \u201coh ok I\u2019ll try to be more polite next time\u201d and move on. Seems like he\u2019s willing to listen to you and move on but just had a minor concern about how you were speaking to him.", "NTA but he was more stupid and lazy than crazy. Good on you for paying enough attention. Poor bunny.", "Rabbits (some rabbits) will voluntarily eat meat. There are even examples of rabbits killing birds and eating them.", "Going nuclear right off was wrong, you should have told him how stupid the idea was in a different way. He accepted that he was mistaken and said he would change the diet. If it makes you feel any better for the rabbit (but not for the dog) cheap dog food is mostly grains with only a little meat in it.", "YTA in that your method lowers the chance of him actually doing the right thing for the rabbit and isn't that the goal?\n\nWhen you take the approach you did there is a potential for him ignoring you completely.\n\nInstead a \"hey, it can be confusing but it's not healthy. Here's some articles that confirm it's not good for rabbits.\"\n\nIf he continues then go nuclear.\n\nAnyway at this point I'd apologize for the approach but firmly and gently press that you're concerned and want him to change the food he buys.", "That\u2019s how you breed carnivore rabbits", "YTA buy an Xbox.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Laziness / frugality are not excuses to neglect your animal. He chose to bring the rabbit into the house.", "Is he ok, your brother? I hope he doesn't live on his own without help. It doesn't seem like he would be able to handle it.", "NTA. Your brother is an idiot who is going to kill his rabbit.", "He was abusing his rabbit. It sounds pretty crazy to me", "NTA wtf", "Spoiler (Soylent Green):\n\n>!Soylent Green is people.!<", "While this is true, they can't eat it regularly and domesticated rabbits shouldn't be fed it. My rabbits have gotten into the cat foot and ate some, they were fine, but their regular diets are as auch for a reason. They won't get correct nutrition otherwise, and it can cause GI Stasis, which can often times be deadly", "Sometimes I voluntarily eat spoonfuls of brown sugar out of the bag but that does not mean it should be my staple diet.", "It\u2019s how you get Rabbits of Caerbannog.  Be careful.", "ESH.\n\nCrazy is an ableist slur.\n\nYes, he deserves to be told off for feeding his rabbit dog food. I'm honestly surprised the poor thing isn't sick, already.\n\nRabbits need to eat mostly hay (85%). But calling him an ableist slur, even if it is a very commonly used word, is not right, either.", "NTA Rabbits are vegetarians, they need a totally different diet than a dog.", "NTA dogs are meat eaters rabbits digestion can't deal with meat.

Was it *forced* on him?", "Plus some people deserve to get yelled at/scolded. If you do things worthy of genuine shock (like feeding dog food to a rabbit) you might be questioned in earnest if you\u2019re crazy. Idk I don\u2019t make the rules. \n\nImo he was probably just embarrassed and tried to turn it on her and off him. I hope he was embarrassed. I hope op helped him research online BASIC RABBIT CARE 101", "Yeah if you want to make rabbit stew or something this diet is overly expensive and wasteful", "Pretty sure that is perfectly true!", "Yep - exactly - OP is NTA at all", "And make sure he's not giving the rabbit iceberg lettuce, it gives rabbits the runs", "Ya is he also eating dog food? How is he navigating through life? People like this always fascinate me", "Sure, but that is exceptional, not normal. Rabbits are hind gut fermenters, and if they eat the wrong things it will disrupt their digestive biome and then they die horribly. Like when horses get into the apples horribly.", "Ya if I was a wild animal trying to survive I\u2019d eat whatever I could get my hands on too. And if I were a domesticated rabbit and my idiot owner gave me dog food then ya I\u2019d chow down cuz I don\u2019t know any better. I\u2019m sure most animals will voluntarily eat most things", "Idk, I think asking if he\u2019s crazy is a pretty natural first reaction. Who has a rabbit to feed, and their first instinct is \u201cdog food?\u201d Normal people would think carrots\u2026lettuce\u2026maybe even research specific feed before buying the animal. He clearly is not fit to take care of it. Tbh the sister should have taken the rabbit away from him. There\u2019s clearly not something clicking up there", "Grains are also extremely bad for rabbits. They need to eat mostly hay, with some other greens, and a very small amount of pellets and certain veggies. Grains and seeds have no place in a rabbit's diet", "I was reminded of the abattoire waste being ground up and fed to cows in the UK \ud83d\ude36\n\nOP is NTA - asking the brother if he is crazy was pretty mild in the circumstances", "This is an amazing reply"]}
