You can say who uses it and who doesn't for any reason you want.

But I think you should give him a chance, and the moment he does a single thing to take his anger out on your computer would be the last time he uses it. And at that moment, you should leave him unless he's willing to go to anger management therapy. Actually, that should be your condition to allowing him to use your laptop. He needs to do therapy to get his emotions under control.\n\nAlso, it's a laptop, it doesn't have sentimental value, get real lol.
