We had to hit our shit TV in the early 2000s sometimes just to get public television. Not even angry hitting. Would I do the same thing to my new flat-screen TV? No.\n\nWould I do it to my $1000ish Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra (2023) just because I was mad? No. Would I jokingly throw my Samsung Galaxy *S4* at the wall because it is a literal decade old and can't even run pokemon go, lags, is almost a complete hunk of junk and worth $50 \"new\"? Sure, I make that back in less than a week. Would I take a S4 from my partner who clearly had sentimental value to it and treat it like crap knowing its THEIRS and a relative gave it to them? NO.\n\nGet real.", "Yes it\u2019s true but that\u2019s besides the point \ud83d\ude2d", "Yea true that, but I was just commenting on the \u201cif he does not respect his property, he certainly won\u2019t respect yours\u201d bit.\n\n\nYea if something is bought together or bought for the household, that\u2019s only when it\u2019s family property", "It's....exactly the point.

I  tried hitting a pillow, but it didn't work. Another good trick for me is to do jumping jacks (5 is enough to get out that near uncontrollable burst). Anyways, my point is, we can and do change if we want to, but we won't be able to if we don't see our behaviour as a problem.\nOP, NTA, and don't let him use it BUT if he doesn't see his behaviour as a problem then OP may be having bigger problems than just the laptop issue.", "Same, put a few holes in walls but I thought they were stronger than they were. Fixed them up though.", "Also a person with intense emotions here! In my teenage years I would throw my phones (they were stronger back then, trust me. It could explode into 6 pieces and I\u2019d just click them back together). I learned to redirect those intense emotions by doing a harmless destruction. Smash a sheet of ice, bang a stick against a tree, rip a cardboard box to smithereens! I also really love screaming into something tiny and silly, it gives time, space, and levity between the trigger and the release\u2026 like open a drawer, find a pen, take off the cap, and scream into the pen cap.

You aren't his parent, he is not your child, and he isn't a teenager who's learning how to behave properly. He needs to straighten up his act. \n\nNTA.

Meh", "NTA, but consider getting away from this guy.\n\nIt is NOT normal for a person to slam and throw things when angry, especially over something as small as an email that irritates him. The violence is likely to escalate further whenever he faces a greater adversity.

Similar to your current experience, I dated a guy who would throw/break phone's/game controllers/laptops. The behavior escalated as time went on, at one point he threw a tantrum over an ex, got in the driver's seat of his car, put the seat back and kicked the windshield out. Eventually, he started getting angry with me and one day decided to push me. I wasn't physically injured, but I certainly understood it was time to run. Honestly, I should have ran long before that, but I had been mentally defending his actions by saying, \"it's just stuff \", until it wasn't.

What would you do \"if\" something happens to yours?  Can he easily replace it?  If not, then you are right for him not to use it.  Be sure to password protect it until this situation gets resolved.  Accidents happen, abuse is a choice. Remember that. \n\nJust an FYI, go to the Dell business refurbished website.  Dell supplies laptops on lease to thousands of companies. When the lease is over or 3 years go by and they deploy new ones on the contracts, they bring the old ones back in house and refurbish them.  Wipe the hard drives clean and do a fresh OS install, all legitimate. You can pick up these perfectly good Dell certified laptops for as low as $250.  I have personally bought 4-5 for family members and it's my go-to if someone doesn't need the absolute latest and greatest. Especially if they just need email and web surfing.  Good luck, hope that helps.", "NTA. Keep your laptop with you even when you go to work or are not in class. If he gets his hands on it he will without a shadow of a doubt break it. You need to get away from this \"man\" and tell/encourage him to get some help for his anger issues before he hurts you.
