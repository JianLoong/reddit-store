{"id": 21827, "submission_id": "14voy0p", "title": "AITA for asking my sister to wear a bra and look more presentable to my wedding?", "selftext": "I (28f) getting married to my fiance \"Nick\" (29m) this August. Nick's parents are paying for most of the wedding, while we are covering some smaller expenses. Due to Nick being their only child, they are wanting a bigger wedding and were allowed to invite a lot of business partners to it, which is something I don't mind as both me and Nick wanted more of a formal wedding. We have sent the invitations with the dresscode of being \" a black tie\" (so formal).\n\nI have a younger sister \"Kate\" (22f) who is a golden child in my family, where my parents and grandparents would allow her to do anything she wanted. Me and my sister do have a relationship, but we are not super close.\n\nNow to the issue. Recently my sister got into \"all natural\" trend, which I had no issues until I saw her dress to my wedding. The dress is an above knee length and is silky Champaign colour, which looks more like a \"nighty\" for the wedding night instead of the dress. And my sister is not planning on wearing any sort of bra or cover underneath, leaving very little to imagination (she is quite busty). The dress does not fit with the dress code and honestly makes her look like she just came from filming a cheap adult film. She also let her hair grow on her legs and armpits and is not planning on shaving either.\n\nI have tried to tell her as politely as I can that she can't show up at my wedding like this and needs to wear a bra with this type of dress as well to find a better outfit that fits the dresscode, but Kate was not having any of this and called me a jelous asshole who is trying to control her. I have explained to her that I am not paying for the wedding and there's reasons why the dresscode has been set in place and have also mentioned business partners who are attending the wedding and I would like my only sister to look presentable, otherwise she will not be allowed to come. This resulted in Kate storming off.\n\nMy parents are on Kate's side, while my fianc\u00e9 and MIL agree with me.\n\nEdit: her dress looked very similar to this https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/NTAAAOSwCrFdfghr/s-l1200.webp\n\nEdit 2: to address my comments about my sister's appearance. Unfortunately where I live looks are very important as well as personal hygiene and women are expected to shave at least their armpits and legs if wearing a revealing dress. If my sister have decided to show up somewhere else looking like this or at work she would immediately be asked to \"take care of herself and make herself presentable\", otherwise she is not allowed on the premises. Regarding the bra comment - there are some dresses and styles that allow you to get away not wearing one, her dress was not one of them and as mentioned made her look like she is ready for bed and not to attend the event. Again wearing it in public would result most places to ask her to cover up and would not let her in uncovered.", "created_utc": 1688980977, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14voy0p/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_wear_a_bra_and_look/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is not a dress.", "NTA I\u2019m all for wearing what you want in everyday life but this is a formal event and you\u2019ve made it clear what is expected, if she doesn\u2019t like it and if what she wears for a few hours to a wedding that isn\u2019t hers matters that much to her, she\u2019s the problem/ selfish/ entitled one and she can stay home. I\u2019ll never understand people who argue with the bride or groom about the dress code on their wedding day!

Her dress does not fit. It's literally that simply. Remind her that unless she is dressed appropriately *for a black tie wedding*, she will not be allowed in when she arrives. Her body hair is her business, but a far too short, almost white dress with nipples poking through is not an appropriate black tie dress for a wedding.\n\nTell your parents that you are protecting Kate as well as yourself; she would be completely humiliated to be so underdressed at a formal event that she is turned away at the door. She's an adult who knows what is and isn't appropriate, so the only reason she's behaving like this is because she wants to make a spectacle of herself. You will not allow her to embarrass you, herself and your family by doing this. She dresses appropriately or she doesn't attend.", "Her dress doesn't look too bad, although it is not black tie appropriate.  \n\nSo NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules.

Your sister should wear what she wants and if she looks goofy or people think she looks weird, it's her problem.\n\nI do get that you don't like her outfit, though.
