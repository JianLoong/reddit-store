Him making de*d mom jokes about you and your mom is not okay.", "Woah NTA. I understand that this guy is in pain; losing a parent is incredibly hard. But that doesn\u2019t give him free reign to rope you into his hurtful coping mechanism. I could understand only making jokes about his own loss, but saying YOUR mom is next in line??? He probably doesn\u2019t mean it in a directly hurtful way, but those are unhealthy and unacceptable jokes to make. He needs therapy.", "NTA. Fine, he's processing in his own way & has been for 3 years. That doesn't give him the right to make remarks *to you* about *your* mom, & it is really awful that your other friends are so cold-hearted they're actually backing up Jack's callous commentary.", "NTA. Jokes about his own dead mom are fair game. Jokes about your very much alive mom dying are not.", "NTA.  As long as his jokes are about his own mom, it's on him. But the moment they're expanded to include your elderly mom, he's crossed a line.", "NTA. He is entitled to make jokes at his own expense to deal with his grief. Gallows humour is a pretty normal way of dealing with that. Making dead mother jokes at your expense is not ok. His circumstances don't give him a right to be a dick to you. He may think that, when the inevitable happens, that he has someone in you that will be on the same page as him so he doesn't feel so alone. That doesn't excuse it, though. A one-on-one convo with him about it is better than a public put down.", "NTA.\n\nIt's been 3 years.  At this point he's not dealing with immediate grief and this is more like a habit he's picked up.\n\nBut rather than mentioning your mom or his, I'd just say \"that joke's getting old\" or \"get some new material\" etc.  Like the joke is boring, not painful.", "NTA. I also have very dark humour in relation to mortality and my dad passed last year. That said, I'd never EVER project it onto someone else's parent. That's just mean.", "NTA\n\nWhen it comes to jokes about dead parents, the only person who can decide to make those jokes are the children of the parent. \n\nDoesn't matter the circumstances, you don't make jokes about real people dying to their loved ones.", "NTA\n\nI get that it's how he copes and nice of your friend circle to understand that but he's going too far with crossing your completely reasonable boundary. Also, he doesn't have to say it out loud or text it for an audience. There's \"processing\" and then there's \"making others feel your pain\".", "Call him out on it. When people are completely inappropriate they shouldn\u2019t get a free pass by using their own issues to support their dickishness. Possibly he\u2019ll get it or you can just cut him from your life, like the blemish he is. NTA", "NTA. Black humour is a good coping mechanism until it\u2019s making someone else uncomfortable or upset.", "NTA. I can sympathise with your friend, and everyone deals with grief in their own way. But he needs to understand that his grief isn't an excuse for him to violate boundaries that you set. Jokes are jokes until the subject of the joke stops finding it funny (for a justifiable reason). Not wanting to hear jokes about your mom dying ESPECIALLY considering her age is entirely justifiable as far as you're concerned; as a side note, your friend group seems kind of terrible if they keep enabling it even after you spoke up.\n\nIt's only \"a part of who he is\" if Jack admits to being an asshole, because it's a shit thing to do. Tell him to cool it, and if it still doesn't work out, consider branching out to some better friends. The total lack of understanding here feels like a pretty concerning indicator about the kinds of people your current friend group is made up of.", "NTA.\n\nDark humour is great for dealing with heavy things like this, but he doesn't have to drag your elderly mother into that. You asked him to calm down with the jokes and he doesn't seem to respect that. That's not what friends do.", "NTA he can say those jokes about his own mom to process his grief but he should say jokes about your mom since it makes you uncomfortable", "NTA\n\nHis coping mechanism is valid on its own. Dark humor can be helpful for people. But no ones need to cope should be causing stress on someone else. He can make jokes around people who aren't hurt by it. Joking about your mom dying is awful", "NTA \n\nMaybe it's time to move on from this group of friends.  Dead to me is nothing to job about.  I've too many family members pass especially this year and I wouldn't want to constantly hear jokes about death.  \n\nIt doesn't mean you have to cut the completely out your life but slowly back off and find better friends.", "NTA.\n\nIt's fine that that's his processing method; he should still respect that this isn't *your* processing method.  He can make dead mom jokes to everybody else, and he can make them about his own mom, not about your mom.", "NTA \u2013 just being put in an undesirable situation by inconsiderate people.  \n\n\nIf you don't like how he is processing his grief and how your friends are \"disrespectful\", don't hang out with them.

Fair if dark humour about his own mum is what helps him, but joking about other peoples family members is stepping over a line, especially since you've expressed that you don't like it. \n\nI'm surprised your friends backed it and wonder how happy they would feel if it was their family being joked about. And God forbid one of your family members does die, does he still get a free pass to joke then?", "NTA. If his coping mechanism involves him making jokes about his mother's passing, no problem. However, it is a problem when he involves your mother. In fact, I think he would love some company in the boat he's in. I don't think it's malicious, but he may find it comforting to think someone in his friend group may be going through the same thing. Not okay. \n\nYou have to be adamant and strike a serious tone when you tell him to stop. Do not make it a kid glove thing either, be serious.

It\u2019s ok for him to joke about *his* dead mom if it helps him, but joking about other people\u2019s parents like that (dead or not) crosses a line. His right to cope with his trauma how he wants ends at the point where he starts to cause other people emotional distress.

While we use our dark humor to cope, we never subject anyone else who doesn\u2019t share that sentiment with us to the jokes. To make a mockery out of something that will change your life is deplorable.\n\nThey may make the jokes because they are feeling lost in their grief and SELFISHLY want someone to relate to.
