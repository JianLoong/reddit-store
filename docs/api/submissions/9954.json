A has one child, and Z has been trying for a baby but hasn\u2019t managed to get pregnant.\n\nWhen A was pregnant she told me and didn\u2019t tell Z. When Z found out she was hugely upset that she had been excluded from the news and told us both so, she was sobbing crying and it was very dramatic. A didn\u2019t tell Z because they have a difficult relationship that stems back to Z being very similar to our mother who was very high strung and not a great parent and mercilessly bullied A. I do not think this is particularly fair but I try not to get involved in their relationship with each other, and didn\u2019t think it was my news to share so didn\u2019t tell Z either - not an explanation Z was very happy with when I explained.\n\nThis is where I think IATA. I am pregnant and have told A and not Z. I know this will make Z feel very left out and the longer I wait the worse the outcome, and the more left out and hurt she will feel. I have two reasons for not telling Z but telling A.\n\n1.) Z has been trying to get pregnant and because of how high strung she is I think me being pregnant is going to tip her over the edge. She has been having panic attacks and I do not want to make it worse.\n\n2.) Selfishly I want to enjoy being pregnant and not deal with the dramatics of it. I have been trying for a long time, and didn\u2019t think this was something that would happen for us, and just want to share the news with people who will be positive and happy for us.\n\nNumber two is why I think I might be the AH the most. I am doing something which I know will hurt Z and I could\u2019ve just not told A.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to be clear there is no way Z will find out from anyone else. The only person in our family who knows is A who will not tell her, and some colleagues at work because I had to tell them to explain throwing up at work. She will find out from me, I just haven\u2019t worked out when and how yet.\n\nEdit 2: I should probably have added more context to the relationship originally - I love Z very much and absolutely want to continue having a close relationship with her. She is smart, kind, caring, beautiful, and can be very supportive. Most of the time she is great, and being high strung and sometimes unpredictable are parts of her personality that I accept as just parts of her because none is perfect, I just try to be careful with these aspects of her.

But a little bit YTA for not telling her about your pregnancy after she made it so clear she didn't want that kind of news kept from her, only because  this isn't a stranger who you can keep this from forever so you're just delaying the inevitable and, as you acknowledge, increasing her hurt. It seems like your sister generally frustrates you and you see her as dramatic and high-strung, and maybe she is those things, but infertility is heartbreaking and you can still be sensitive to her wishes (when they're reasonable). Not wanting her sister's pregnancy kept from her is totally reasonable. \n\nThe way I've heard others who deal with infertility request this news is via text message, which will also help you avoid the extreme reaction you're worried about, at least in person. You texting her the news allows her to react to it privately, in her own time, and will also hopefully help you avoid having the kind of extreme reaction you're worried about to your face.", "Why not send out a text to both sisters announcing the news?", "NTA Well, it is your life and you can do what you want, but how do you think you are going to hide that you are pregnant? You know she is going to find out at some point and then you have the drama for sure, since you could have told her months before.   \nYou should decide whether you want a relationship with Z or not. If not, then you're doing the right thing, but if you do want a relationship with her, you should tell her sooner rather than later. You never know, she might surprise you.", "NAH but the consistent advice I've seen on dealing with this is to text the person to tell them so they can deal with the emotions privately. Don't subject her to an in-person announcement, especially not in a group. \n\nYou're going to have to tell her eventually, and the longer you wait the more it becomes about her struggles with infertility PLUS the feeling of being left out.

I\u2019d probably just text Z, though.

I thought Z has been non-tolerable with everyone that has gotten pregnant. Ik A\u2019s reason for not telling Z because of the bullying \u2014 I get that & A definitely doesn\u2019t have to tell her cause Z doesn\u2019t deserve to know but u just act like ur this good sister to both of them cause u understood where A is coming from with her pregnancy.

I think it's really hurtful to withhold big information like this from family...especially just leaving one person out. I get it's complicated though but I'd feel very alone here....like both sisters were against me.", "NTA. Both your reasons not to tell Z are valid, you have a right to enjoy your pregnancy, and more importantly, you have a right to decide with whom you share personal news such as your pregnancy. \n\nNormally, I would say that it's not really fair to just assume what a person would do or feel and use that as a reason to exclude them from something. But Z has a history of making things about herself --she did so with A's pregnancy-- and you described her as high strung more than once in a short post so I can only imagine that she really is that high maintenance, the type of person you need to walk on eggshells around all the time because everything tips them over. \n\nFertility issues are a very sensitive topic, and people who struggle to conceive tend to be overly sensitive about the whole pregnancy/parenthood/babies thing, after a while. It's not always malicious but it's all too common for people with fertility problems to end up making other's joyful news about themselves. \n\nI think you're fine waiting for as long as you need. But you need a support network and to be emotionally prepared because, as you said, the longer you wait, the bigger the drama will be.", "YTA. You know she\u2019s already been through this once before, and you\u2019re intentionally keeping her in the dark about it. You could handle this differently and you\u2019re choosing the worst option on purpose.", "Very Soft YTA\n\nYou should've just told her. And if you want to avoid the dramatics from her then just keep her at an arm's length.\n\nYou knew what would've happened if you didn't tell Z and you even said that she might react even worse than before, so what exactly was the plan there? Did you plan to just hide the entire pregnancy and the existence of your child? There are times when you simply need to do the hard or uncomfortable thing otherwise it'll just get worse, this is one of those times", "NTA.

The baby bump would anyhow give it away soon. \n\nBest luck though!", "YTA - if you won\u2019t share the most important news of this time of your life with her, then why continue pretending that you think of her as your sister? You know this is going to hurt her, so you\u2019re choosing to hurt her. Let me repeat it for those in the back, you\u2019re choosing to hurt someone you pretend to care about.

We have had family therapy, and I regularly remind A not to punish Z for things she didn\u2019t do because our mother is not here herself to deal with them. I have always thought this dynamic is harsh and unfair on Z, but I cannot impact how A feels, and unfortunately neither can Z.", "Thank you for sharing and I\u2019m very sorry to hear about your miscarriage and IVF. I hope everything has or will work out for you.\n\nA lot of people in the comments have said about giving her time to process the news in her own space. I think I\u2019m going to arrange lunch with her on Sunday, and send the scan pictures on Saturday morning. Then she has time to have her cry in private and cancel seeing me if she needs to, but if not we can talk about it on Sunday in (hopefully) a sensitive nice way.", "Oh, this totally changes things then", "I think that sounds lovely. But when you send the scan pictures, please do so with some validation of her own struggles accompanying them to set up the conversation the next day. Best of luck!", "I will do, thank you for the advice \u2764\ufe0f", "If you want to have any relationship with Z going forward you need to tell her. You can limit the opportunity for stress for her and you by doing it by text, email, carrier pigeon ... it doesn't matter. Just tell her now. YWBTA if you continue to hide this pregnancy from Z.", "NTA. It is not selfish to want to enjoy this time. \nBreak the news gently. Perhaps seek advice on how to do it from a fertility counsellor or charity? Congratulations on your lovely news xxxxx", "NTA Nobody is entitled to pregnancy news. Your right to enjoy your own pregnancy with minimal stress and drama trumps her right to know about her sister's pregnancy.", "I have 4 sisters and they range all over the shop in terms of personalities. Some are easier to confide in than others despite the fact I love them all.\n\nI don't think it is selfish to want a dramatic free pregnancy. That's your choice. However, I think you need to also accept the consequences of this choice. If you exclude Z knowing it will hurt her just because you don't want to deal with her personality do you really think she will want to remain close to you? \n\nThis isn't a decision on whether you are an A H it is about what is more important. Having so many sisters myself with such a diverse range of personalities I can sympathize. Some are just easier to confide in, while others are always a lot more work. However, if I exclude them for being more work I effect our relationship so I always need to decide if excluding them to lessen my workload is worth the impact to our relationship. After doing it once a long time ago I have never done it again, my sister K is the biggest drama queen on the planet but not seeing her for 6 mths nearly 20 yrs ago hurt way more than the headache including her would have caused, but that's my choice. You need to weigh up you options and make your own. Actions have reactions, a dramatic person is not going to casually except being excluded, especially by someone who previously saw how negatively it impacted her the first time.", "YTA. There is so much fucked up about this. I feel bad for Z. Her sisters, who claim to love her, suck.", "You do realise there will be a baby at the end of your pregnancy, right? You are either never going to tell her because you will never see her again or she will know when the baby is born and she will not want to talk to you because she will be extremely hurt. As you know from previous experiences. \n\nHow the hell do you think this is going to play out?", "No, she\u2019s choosing the option that she thinks will make her sister act less dramatic, assuming she\u2019s going to be somehow less dramatic about being iced out of a pregnancy announcement. You get to pick who you let in on life events, but when you know you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s crushed someone once already, you\u2019re still an asshole.", "I would be caustious after mentioning the physical violence. Do you know if she has someone to talk to about her mental health? It sounds like she is have mood issues and easily something can trigger it. I'm saying you don't love her, but know if she has a therapist or someone to talk before hand might be more reassuring to you and help you relax...not that it's your responsibility.\n\nI would be worried about you baby, but as a sister I'd worry about her own mental health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs someone who has had anger issues and mood issues, that changed dramatically when I got on a mood stabilizer. But instead of taking my anger out on the folks around me, I was very harmful to myself. Stuff I'm still processing. But I've stabled out quite nicely. So when maybe just for family sake keep her at a distance and suggest someone in the family check on her with that. It sounds like she needs help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut you have every right to withhold information from people don't let the folks on here tell you otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut I also feel like you wont be able to relax until you know your sister and your baby are both safe.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing this. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
