Regardless of how serious you think they may be, or not be, what you did is shitty. Sibling code says you never, ever, become involved with each others girlfriend/boyfriend etc. You betrayed your own brother.

Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little fucked up that you thought it would be okay to entertain justin. Claim or no claim\u2026.

We all have crushes, even when we know it\u2019s not practical or realistic, but that little bit of hope is enough to excite you brother.

You tried to sleep with someone your brother was sleeping with. Where in the actual hell are you thinking  thats an ok thing to do. I wouldnt trust you as far as i could throw you after you pulled that nonsense. Your poor brother must be devastated to have such a sneaky backstabbing sister.", "Did you read what you posted? You really have to ask? Yes you are the asshole.", "If you were just warning your brother from future heartbreak then it would have been okay, the sisterly thing to do, but you have spoken to him about it only after meeting the guy and establishing some sort of connection. \n\nA) you going after the guy your brother has feelings for makes you TA.\n\nB) the guy is charming and has fun with different people? Why are you so convinced that you are different and will be the one this Justin commits to? IMO, he wants a family set.\n\nC) It doesn't sound like you gave the brother a reality check, but that you said \"Justin wants me and not you!\". YTA!", "YTA obviously. What sort of a person tries to get together with the guy their sibling is in love with? I don't care whether or not Justin wants nothing more than to be fwb with your brother - you are a massive asshole for even considering going out with him. \n\nJustin is also an asshole, by the way. Imagine the audacity it takes to hit on and exchange numbers with the sibling of the guy you're hooking up with regularly? If it weren't for how horribly it'd hurt your brother, I'd say you and Justin should actually give it a go - see how miserable you can make one another.", "Why are you so jealous of your brother?", "YTA", "YTA.

AITA?\"\n\n\"Yeah, YTA.\"\n\nI mean, there's literally no way to read this story where you don't come across as obviously the bad guy.  It's just kind of really glaringly obvious.  \n\nIf I had to guess how you justify this to yourself, I think it's because you have feelings for Justin and you regard those as 'real' whereas your brother and Justin are 'just a fling'.  I think everyone else in this story sees who you are pret-ty clearly though :D", "This always makes YTA. There are literally billions of people on earth. You are inviting unnecessary drama and pain for the people you care about when you do shit like this. Just no. Block Justin. It doesn\u2019t matter if he wants to be serious with your brother or not, you don\u2019t date your siblings partners. Or exes for that matter. There is just no need to do that.

It doesn\u2019t matter how serious their relationship is.

This screams \u201cI hate my brother, I\u2019m so jealous of him that i need to have the upper hand in something and \u201ctake\u201d something from him\u201d."]}
