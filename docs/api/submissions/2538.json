My husband (M35) takes her to school in the mornings on the way to his work. \n\nMIL got divorced a couple months ago and not-so-subtly complained to my husband that she was lonely, so my husband insisted that we have her over every weekend. MIL and I don\u2019t get along. For example, MIL has always made snide remarks about me being a teenage mom but I learned to ignore it since my husband asked me to keep the peace. When she began coming over, she would make comments about how dusty the floor was, how much laundry was in the basket, etc. \u2013 hinting that I should be doing more housework as a SAHM. The final straw was when she commented about our daughter\u2019s academic abilities, saying stuff about how she\u2019s below standard academic level and blaming me for not putting in the effort to teach her.

I arrive at my daughter's school and see MIL with daughter. I walk up to them and tell MIL that she can find a way home, that I\u2019m not going to give her a lift. She started to create a scene and the other parents and children were starting to stare, so I took my daughter by the hand and drove away. \n\nHusband yelled at me when he got home, saying that I embarrassed MIL in front of the other parents and left her stranded when I could have easily driven her home.

She knows full well what she was doing all those years. Your husband knows too. He just doesn't care. \n\nThis has always been a husband problem. He doesn't stand up for you and doesn't care that you said no. He still thinks you are a teen and he is the adult and therefore he can manipulate you. He would rather keep mommy happy than respect you.  There is a reason older guys are with younger women and you are feeling the repercussions years later.

Major strike against him\n\n \n-Ur MIL needs to butt out of ur marriage (another strike against ur husband because HE should have shut the down immediately).\n\n\n-It really wouldn't have been the end of the world if u drove her home. And yet another strike against ur husband because again HE SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT U IN THE POSITION LET ALONE BE MAD AT U. Disappointed, annoyed, or frustrated? Yes but not mad. He should have just shook his head at u then promptly turned to his mother and told her, her words and actions have consequences.", "NTA. You told your husband no. He chose to put your MIL in the situation, not you. I wouldn\u2019t give that old bag a ride until she apologised for treating me bad and promised to behave in the future.", "NTA your husband should have convinced her to walk to a bus stop. You should not have to do favors for a woman who treats you poorly, and your husband needs to step up and stop letting her get away with it.", "NTA. You have no obligation to do favors for a woman that treats you badly, family or not. You told your husband no and he disrespected your boundaries and tried to force it anyways. You weren\u2019t the one that embarrassed her, he did by putting her in that position in the first place. The only thing I hope is that it doesn\u2019t start drama for your daughter at school. 3rd-4th graders will spread that drama like wildfire and she\u2019ll be caught up right in the middle of it.", "ESH\n\nYou should have an adult conversation with your MIL about your boundaries and how you won't tolerate her demeaning you with her comments.  \n\nThe state of your home and your child's education is not her business and she can leave those subjects alone.    \n  \nBut instead you make your point by leaving her at your kids school without any way of getting home.   \n\nI get it - she's a pain in the ass, but acting like a child doesn't help the situation.  \n\nYour husband knows how you feel, he knows how his mother feels and still put you in a position of  having to drive her home.   \n\nYou all suck.", "NTA. You said no and held to your boundary. That sets a good example for your daughter actually, that you won't let people walk all over you when they disrespect you.", "NTA. your MIL made her bed now she can lie in it. And your husband knew your stance before he volunteered you.  It's funny how mil drives a wedge between you& mad when you don't want anything to do with her.  Buy her a bus pass, then she won't have to worry about being embarrassed", "NTA.  I love the way you handled it.\n\nYou will have to work on your husband and his relationship with his mother because it will blow up on you one day.", "NTA. Your devotion is to your husband and your child, not MIL. Your husband should really be more caring about your feelings. It is not your place or job to do things for your MIL, especially when she has been so sour to you. Your husband should be the ones making these arrangements for her if he\u2019s gonna try to just place it on you.", "NTA.

She's making snide remarks on your teenage pregnancy completely ignoring the fact that HER SON HAS CAUSED IT?", "NTA", "ESH. Your husband put you in a rough situation and it sounds like he keeps putting you second to his mother, especially knowing that you and your MIL don\u2019t get along and that she\u2019s actively insulting his wife. \n\nThat said, it was probably rough for your kid to be in that situation at school in front of her peers, as it wasn\u2019t her fault either. It might have been smartest to just take them both home and then have that conversation there so your kid could be kept out of it, but it was probably hard to think of what to do in the moment. You shouldn\u2019t have been put in that situation in the first place, so I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that.", "ESH You have a husband problem. He is putting his mothers wants and needs above his wife. I feel for your MIL\u2019s loneliness, but she needs to build her own social life for that instead. It is fine to have her come by every once in a while, but every weekend leaves no time for your family with your husband and daughter to have your own healthy family dynamic. And she is rude and condescending to you while she is in your home, adding stress to your family dynamic. \n\nI understand you do not like your MIL and that the stress and negative feelings she has put on your lead you to leave her at your daughter\u2019s school. However, I don\u2019t think you should have left her there. Your daughter probably experienced some stress from being put in that interaction at her school too. \n\nYou and your husband need to sit down and discuss boundaries when it comes to your MIL. Marriage counseling could really benefit you both so you have the tools to navigate these things together rather than being at odds.", "ESH - Nothing wrong with refusing to give her a ride and your husband should've taken no for an answer but you should've repeated the no when your husband texted you instead of surprising her with it, you should not have let him and her think she was getting a ride.", "Yta.  You have embarrassed yourself in front of the other parents and you come off as a little big.  I think others at the school will avoid you.", "YTA. I understand you don\u2019t like her, but she\u2019s a person and really shouldn\u2019t have been left alone like that with no transportation. What if something bad happened to her? How would you feel? The little effort you could have taken to do one good deed may have begun a path to repairing your relationship. Instead, you further strained the relationship and strained your relationship with your husband. You may not like her, but you can\u2019t choose your family sometimes, and when you married your husband, you knew you were marrying into the whole family.", "YTA. Whatever is going on with you and MIL, you should not have put your daughter in the middle of your issues. Your daughter presumably loves her grandmother and had to watch the two of you argue. And at her school. How embarrassing for her. Furthermore, your MIL was told by your husband to walk to the school and that you would take her home. He's the person you should have had a discussion with, later that evening.", "So there are no grownups in this situation", "YTA.

The mom needs to be shut down and her son doesn\u2019t seem to want to do it.
