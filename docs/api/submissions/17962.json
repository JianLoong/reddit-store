One day, after noticing that my son (4yo) wasn\u2019t able to drive his ride-on car onto the patio cause it was two inches above the yard, she opted to pile up soil and gravel on the grass to create a ramp he can go up onto the patio space with rather than just have him drive the car on the yard clockwise where he *could* already drive up onto the patio space. The logic behind that still escapes me.  \n\nI take pride in my yards. I like having nice, soft and even grass for the kids to play on rather than a dry, patchy, half barren stretch of dust. She *knows* that. She knows the work I put into it. She even made sure I knew it was my wife that burned a patch in my grass last year trying to deal with ants by pouring boiled water on it cause she didn\u2019t want me thinking it was her but she still piled soil and gravel on a section of the backyard in the early spring and I hadn\u2019t noticed till it was time to begin my annual yard work preparing for the season (trimming hedges, killing weeds, first mow, reseeding, fertilizing, etc). By then the damage was done. Grass was gone, soil packed tight like concrete, loose gravel spread all over the yard like land mines for my mower (blade is chewed up now).  \n\nIt took me the afternoon to dig out, loosen and level the soil again, to pick up all the gravel and an entire 5kg(11lbs) bag of lawn patch and repair (mulch/seed/fertilizer) to fix it. It will be late into the summer before it begins to look like it\u2019s filling out again.  \n\nToday, after a light rainfall overnight, I was checking to see if it needed more watering when my MIL stormed out trying to telling me that pile of soil and gravel *has* to be there for my son. I lost my cool in return and angrily signaled to her that he still can drive the car, just clockwise around the yard and through the patio. She stormed back into the suite and later told my wife that if I didn\u2019t like how she was babysitting the kids, I can take care of them myself (I do, she just does it when I\u2019m actually working). Again, I struggle with the logic there as the issue was that my yard was destroyed in an attempt to not get my son to change direction when he drives his little car and not that she isn\u2019t watching them.  \n\nMy wife has taken her side, arguing she has the right to do whatever she wants to to our property.  \n\nAm I the asshole for repairing my yard after my MIL destroyed it?", "created_utc": 1684817287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13peau3/aita_for_repairing_my_yard_after_my_mil_destroyed/", "score": 253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not unreasonable for the co-owner(s) to want to design a portion of the yard, since it seems that most of it is done according to your preferences anyway. \n\nGoing forward, if the MIL is a problem, and if she doesn't have a stake in the house, you are within your rights to talk to your wife about moving her out. The basement apartment can presumably be rented at market rates and you could use that money to pay for childcare. And your wife would be within her rights to disagree and if you can't reach an understanding, you can let a divorce court settle it. Do I think it's silly to go this far over a patch of lawn? Sure. But you seem to be very determined to have your way, and your wife and MIL seem to have the same problem.", ">I take pride in my yards\n\n>in the early spring and I hadn\u2019t noticed till it was time to begin my annual yard work\n\nPick a story and stick with it. YTA, you didn't notice for *months* and now it's a problem cause the grass doesn't go right to the patio? Take advantage of the excuse to get rid of the rest of the crap and plant some real plants. At best this is E S H, cause she really could have asked.", "ESH, stop obsessing about the lawn, your kids don't care about \"soft grass\", they'd just as happily play in a gravel pit.\n\nMaybe your MIL shouldn't have added the ramp for your son without talking to you, but it sounds like you are way too obsessed with keeping your lawn a certain way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your MIL is living permanently in your house and is completely involved in day-to-day family life. Is she paying rent? Do you pay her for babysitting? If the answer to both of these questions is \u2018no\u2019 then she is definitely part of the family unit.", "Buy a ramp, my dude.  Spend $30 on Amazon and present it to her and fix all of this.", "ESH, firstly you obviously don\u2019t spend that much time in the garden if you don\u2019t notice for weeks/months. Your MIL should have absolutely asked before changing anything. Why don\u2019t you make him a temporary wooden ramp. There\u2019s more than one way to fix a problem.", "Another perspective- you are all literally fighting over a pile of dirt. Is it really worth all the drama?", "\"He can still play with his toy if he only rides it this direction along this route.\" Do you realize how boring that will be for a kid? Grandma puts in a little ramp at this point and now kid can ride it anywhere how they like.  How did you not notice all this time if you are constantly maintaining a perfect yard? It's a yard and you say you keep it soft for the kids to play on. Well dude they've been playing with their bitchen ramp this whole time and you never noticed. Rebuild the damn ramp in a way that will let your kid play with that area again and will also look good enough for you not to care in the 10 whole minutes a year you actually spend in that spot.

They used to do garden projects with hand gestures and about 5 common words.", "I mean NTA but couldn't you change the yard so your son can go both directions and do it in way that looks nice and makes you happy.\n\nSeems like a fair compromise then.", "YTA. Stop wasting so much time on your lawn and help your kids play on the cool race track that can now accommodate laps in both directions. Honestly you sound as if your priorities are out of whack.", "ESH  \nCan you just appreciate your MIL actually helps you out and cares more about your kid than your lawn?

I find it hard to believe that your MIL would build a ramp for no reason. Is he refusing to complete the course so MIL built him a shortcut?\n\nKnowing how high strung you are about your yard, she probably should have asked first but did you ask her why the ramp was built?", "ESH\n\nSeriously. You three need to learn to speak a single language and COMMUNICATE. Yes.

If the raw dirt is a problem for him esthetically then make a little ramp", "On top of that OP already admits it\u2019s going to take all summer to look normal again, so why not just let the kid have the fun of driving on the already created ramp.

They only noticed during their yearly maintenance of the property as a whole.  That means they usually spend about 10 minutes a year in that spot, while his kids are actually playing in that area a lot. The kids get more use of it than he does. Honestly he should write that spot off as the kids play area. Dudes got a boy. He's lucky the kid isn't trying to dig a hole to China in his front yard", "There's a big difference between gardening and obsessing about a lawn.", "It's unrealistic to be this obsessed with it when he has toddlers."]}
