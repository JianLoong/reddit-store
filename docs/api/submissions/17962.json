One day, after noticing that my son (4yo) wasn\u2019t able to drive his ride-on car onto the patio cause it was two inches above the yard, she opted to pile up soil and gravel on the grass to create a ramp he can go up onto the patio space with rather than just have him drive the car on the yard clockwise where he *could* already drive up onto the patio space. The logic behind that still escapes me.  \n\nI take pride in my yards. I like having nice, soft and even grass for the kids to play on rather than a dry, patchy, half barren stretch of dust. She *knows* that. She knows the work I put into it. She even made sure I knew it was my wife that burned a patch in my grass last year trying to deal with ants by pouring boiled water on it cause she didn\u2019t want me thinking it was her but she still piled soil and gravel on a section of the backyard in the early spring and I hadn\u2019t noticed till it was time to begin my annual yard work preparing for the season (trimming hedges, killing weeds, first mow, reseeding, fertilizing, etc). By then the damage was done. Grass was gone, soil packed tight like concrete, loose gravel spread all over the yard like land mines for my mower (blade is chewed up now).  \n\nIt took me the afternoon to dig out, loosen and level the soil again, to pick up all the gravel and an entire 5kg(11lbs) bag of lawn patch and repair (mulch/seed/fertilizer) to fix it. It will be late into the summer before it begins to look like it\u2019s filling out again.  \n\nToday, after a light rainfall overnight, I was checking to see if it needed more watering when my MIL stormed out trying to telling me that pile of soil and gravel *has* to be there for my son.

It's not that hard of a job, it just can't be soil-compacting gravel. Heck if you're inclined to, you could make the kid an entire little obstacle course ramp that you can remove once he's older without wrecking the soil permanently.", "Or thinks it's their yard vs. his thinking it's his yard...", "Or recognizes that maybe her mother babysitting is worth more.", "Some people just like drama and will do anything it takes to feel personally attacked", "But the kid actually uses the yard for playing. OP didn\u2019t notice for months! So what hard work? Cuz if you want nice grass it takes work all seasons and he would\u2019ve noticed immediately", "OP should build a ramp that looks good to him. \n\nMIL is watching young kids while the parents work, if this makes it easier for her why fight it?", "Ah yes, but it's ok for some person to destroy a backyard that isn't hers.", "Clover is great, too! I dont figure I know everything, but in my area, moss will grow anywhere. I did also say feel free to disregard; it's just something I get weirdly excited about, tbh. \n\nI'm not trying to push it on anyone, I just know a ton of people haven't even considered that it was a thing you can do (not saying that anyone's dumb, just that it wasn't a thought that had occurred to them). The first time I read about it, my mind was blown.", "Even if he's more passionate about the lawn than his family? How big do you think this \"ramp\" was, maybe 2x3? Get a grip", "I\u2019m an avid gardener. If it\u2019s nice enough for the child to be playing outside, then I don\u2019t see how he hasn\u2019t been out in the yard for so long that this destroyed his grass. If the grass was dormant it should have been fine. I had hay bales on a section of my grass from October to may and it is fine. Also it won\u2019t take that long for the grass to grow. I grow a section of my grass from nothing every spring because of my dogs and it takes a month before it looks nice.", "Growing grass is not gardening", "literally! double standards as per usual. apparently men can't have unsupportive partners, the wife is a saint /s", "Haha, yes you get me. \ud83d\ude05\nWanted to give her a point of difference though!", "It's OP's lawn, on OP's property. They can do as they please with it.", "I mean, it took him months to notice it. Maybe spread out the anal a bit?", "Wife needs to grow a backbone and side with hubby tho. I know how much work a lawn takes. When I lived with my parents me and Dad always did all the yard work and having a good lawn is not an easy job. Dumping a load of dirt and gravel on there is a shit move without even asking beforehand.", "I can't believe MIL is making this ramp her Ramp To Die On.  It seems so...unnecessary. \n\nYes, 2 and 4 yos  have weird preferences sometimes,  but how hard is it to just convince them to drive the other direction?  In a week they'll have forgotten they preferredthe other way.", "Handle your business.\n\nThe yard wasn\u2019t destroyed. I can say with almost 100% certainty that this 60+ grandma who is taking care of a toddler, didn\u2019t move a couple hundred pounds of soil and gravel to create a mountain and ruining 100 ft.\u00b2 of the yard.\n\nAdditionally, this area is obviously used often by the toddler. If he hasn\u2019t been in his backyard, playing with his toddler months\u2026 that\u2019s a whole Nother thing.", "I don't think anyone's saying that. Just that OP claims the yard is that important yet doesn't notice a problem for months on end that is so bad it will take a year to fix. I'm not buying it. My partner's the gardener and the only way it would take her more than a few days to notice a problem like that in our garden is if we were away on vacation when it happened.", "ok I probably sounded crankier than I needed to, sorry. I get \"just grow moss\" all the time and it aggravates me to tears because like yeah it's super cute if you have the climate for it but I don't. I have grass I mow electric and don't feed, spray, or water until I can figure out a replacement that won't die and isn't plastic or non-porous hardscape. And it actually does get a fair amount of native birds.\n\nHoping the clover works. Though it's not native and some grass is so I'm conflicted. (Kikiyu can all die though - please)", "Gardening is a hobby with actual benefits, lawn obsession is a weird antiquated status symbol. In a way lawn is the antithesis to gardening.", "You\u2019re right, huge gardener here, but I also love a nice lawn.  We got another dog last spring & now it looks terrible, dog urine kills.  OP\u2019s desire for a nice lawn isn\u2019t out of line.", "Yes there\u2019s a degree of separation there on the asshole scale haha", "But OP is making it his hill to die on too\u2026. For me ESH. It\u2019s grass in a backyard, not some famous garden. Plus, he\u2019s so flippant about MIL watching his kids \u201conly when he works\u201d he sounds ungrateful.", "That's fair, I wasn't aware it didn't grow everywhere (except in like the desert or arctic, that's obvious).\n\nI'm sorry you have been borderline harassed about it, that sucks. I'll keep my fingers crossed for tge clover! I love clover.", "It's grass *this* time. The bigger problem here isn't the grass, but rather that MIL felt comfortable making changes to the property without even saying \"hey, I'd like to put a gravel ramp here, how does that sound?\".\n\nI'm leaning to ESH because OP didn't even notice for months, but this is a communication problem."]}
