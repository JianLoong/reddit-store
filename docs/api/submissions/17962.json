One day, after noticing that my son (4yo) wasn\u2019t able to drive his ride-on car onto the patio cause it was two inches above the yard, she opted to pile up soil and gravel on the grass to create a ramp he can go up onto the patio space with rather than just have him drive the car on the yard clockwise where he *could* already drive up onto the patio space. The logic behind that still escapes me.  \n\nI take pride in my yards. I like having nice, soft and even grass for the kids to play on rather than a dry, patchy, half barren stretch of dust. She *knows* that. She knows the work I put into it. She even made sure I knew it was my wife that burned a patch in my grass last year trying to deal with ants by pouring boiled water on it cause she didn\u2019t want me thinking it was her but she still piled soil and gravel on a section of the backyard in the early spring and I hadn\u2019t noticed till it was time to begin my annual yard work preparing for the season (trimming hedges, killing weeds, first mow, reseeding, fertilizing, etc). By then the damage was done.
