One day, after noticing that my son (4yo) wasn\u2019t able to drive his ride-on car onto the patio cause it was two inches above the yard, she opted to pile up soil and gravel on the grass to create a ramp he can go up onto the patio space with rather than just have him drive the car on the yard clockwise where he *could* already drive up onto the patio space. The logic behind that still escapes me.  \n\nI take pride in my yards. I like having nice, soft and even grass for the kids to play on rather than a dry, patchy, half barren stretch of dust. She *knows* that. She knows the work I put into it. She even made sure I knew it was my wife that burned a patch in my grass last year trying to deal with ants by pouring boiled water on it cause she didn\u2019t want me thinking it was her but she still piled soil and gravel on a section of the backyard in the early spring and I hadn\u2019t noticed till it was time to begin my annual yard work preparing for the season (trimming hedges, killing weeds, first mow, reseeding, fertilizing, etc). By then the damage was done. Grass was gone, soil packed tight like concrete, loose gravel spread all over the yard like land mines for my mower (blade is chewed up now).  \n\nIt took me the afternoon to dig out, loosen and level the soil again, to pick up all the gravel and an entire 5kg(11lbs) bag of lawn patch and repair (mulch/seed/fertilizer) to fix it. It will be late into the summer before it begins to look like it\u2019s filling out again.  \n\nToday, after a light rainfall overnight, I was checking to see if it needed more watering when my MIL stormed out trying to telling me that pile of soil and gravel *has* to be there for my son. I lost my cool in return and angrily signaled to her that he still can drive the car, just clockwise around the yard and through the patio. She stormed back into the suite and later told my wife that if I didn\u2019t like how she was babysitting the kids, I can take care of them myself (I do, she just does it when I\u2019m actually working). Again, I struggle with the logic there as the issue was that my yard was destroyed in an attempt to not get my son to change direction when he drives his little car and not that she isn\u2019t watching them.  \n\nMy wife has taken her side, arguing she has the right to do whatever she wants to to our property.  \n\nAm I the asshole for repairing my yard after my MIL destroyed it?", "created_utc": 1684817287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13peau3/aita_for_repairing_my_yard_after_my_mil_destroyed/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The yard is your project does your wife want to be responsible for landscaping?", "Here is where I say that you don't have a mil problem. You have a wife problem.\n\nYour mil made changes. Your wife was happy with them and you changed back.\n\nNo communication.\n\nI'm going to say esh here.\n\nJust making changes without talking to someone is low level petty passive aggressive crap.", "INFO: who actually owns the property? \n\nIf it belongs to you alone, then your wife and MIL have no right to make changes to it without your permission. \n\nIf it's shared property with your wife and/or your MIL, then this needs to be discussed between the two/three of you. It's not unreasonable for the co-owner(s) to want to design a portion of the yard, since it seems that most of it is done according to your preferences anyway. \n\nGoing forward, if the MIL is a problem, and if she doesn't have a stake in the house, you are within your rights to talk to your wife about moving her out. The basement apartment can presumably be rented at market rates and you could use that money to pay for childcare. And your wife would be within her rights to disagree and if you can't reach an understanding, you can let a divorce court settle it. Do I think it's silly to go this far over a patch of lawn? Sure. But you seem to be very determined to have your way, and your wife and MIL seem to have the same problem.", ">I take pride in my yards\n\n>in the early spring and I hadn\u2019t noticed till it was time to begin my annual yard work\n\nPick a story and stick with it. YTA, you didn't notice for *months* and now it's a problem cause the grass doesn't go right to the patio? Take advantage of the excuse to get rid of the rest of the crap and plant some real plants. At best this is E S H, cause she really could have asked.", "ESH, stop obsessing about the lawn, your kids don't care about \"soft grass\", they'd just as happily play in a gravel pit.\n\nMaybe your MIL shouldn't have added the ramp for your son without talking to you, but it sounds like you are way too obsessed with keeping your lawn a certain way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
