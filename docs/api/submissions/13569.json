She plays soccer, takes swim lessons and will play outside a lot with neighborhood kids. She\u2019s very social. Most of her friends are from outside of school.\n\nAt school, however, she struggles making friends. Cleo has ADHD and was bullied in 3rd and 4th grade for some of that. While it was brought under control by 5th (current grade), these kids still don\u2019t play with her and pretty much ice her out. While I don\u2019t think they have to play with her, it also means that she doesn\u2019t socialize a lot at school. She\u2019s okay with this. \n\n\nHer teacher says our daughter often plays alone at recess or reads.  My wife and I were not very concerned and explained she\u2019s very social and active afterwards.\n\nCleo is a huge reader. She\u2019s currently reading her way through my wife\u2019s collection of books from her childhood. She loves them and treasures them, knowing they were her mama\u2019s and wants to take great care of them. She came home on Tuesday, very upset and worried her mom would be upset with her. I asked why and she said her teacher took her book away and won\u2019t give it back until tomorrow. When pressed for more information , she said she was reading at recess. Her teacher walked over, took the book and told her to go play. My daughter begged for her book back and the teacher refused.\n\nI quickly assured Cleo that she wasn\u2019t in trouble and even called my wife at work to have her back me up. It was quite concerning that she was so afraid, as my wife isn\u2019t one to fly off the handle. She\u2019s always gentle with Cleo. As suspected, my wife assured her she wasn\u2019t upset and that Cleo did zero wrong.\n\nThe next day, I brought Cleo to school early and walked her to class, no one but the teacher was there. I told the teacher to give me the book. She obliged and tried to defend herself. I told her to save it and she had no right. There is no rule that Cleo *has* to do physical activity at recess and we expressed no concern. The teacher said she was allowed to set boundaries for her class but I pointed out recess was free time. It\u2019s not like Cleo is reading during math. We went back and forth, and finally I said I\u2019d be reaching out to the principal.\n\nThe issue was resolved quickly. I don\u2019t know the particulars, except the principal told me that Cleo is allowed to read at recess and unless she is actively harming someone or reading during a non-designated time, she wouldn\u2019t have any more books confiscated. My wife and I were pleased. Cleo even more so.\n\nMy cousin is a teacher at this school, just a different grade. She says what I did is \u201chot gossip\u201d in the teacher\u2019s lounge and that I have been marked as \u201cone of those parents\u201d. She says the teacher isn\u2019t paid enough and I should\u2019ve just accepted the rule. When I pointed out we only have 2 more months left at this school (Cleo is our only and starts junior high in august), that\u2019s not a concern. \n\nMy wife and I feel justified, but we are wondering if I\u2019m an asshole?", "created_utc": 1680200623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126v46f/aita_for_becoming_that_parent_by_causing_a_stink/", "score": 7039, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Thank you for standing up for your daughter.", "NTA I am a teacher, and if I ever have a student who is reading *for fun* I actively encourage it.

And doesn't that sometimes sound like actual torture and you'd like nothing more than to just relax with a good book?

First off your cousin is a AH for engaging in \u201chot gossip\u201d instead of sticking up for family. Secondly Cleo reading at recess is in no way wrong. She can spend her recess how she see fit and if reading a book helps her recharge, that\u2019s her choice. It\u2019s good you stood up for her and let her know you had her back. As for the teacher, major AH because how is her reading affecting you? She needs to be somewhere recharging herself. Not being a playground bully to your kid.", "NTA.  There is a difference between being \"one of those parents\" and standing up for you child.  It's good she knows you are there for her.", "The only way that I could see any reason that the teacher would do it (which is still wrong) is if Cleo had been antsy and acting out and she thought maybe activity at recess would calm her down for the afternoon.

I don't know that I've ever seen a teacher disapprove of a child reading unless it was affecting his other studies. NTA", "You're NTA. I was often that kid who was reading at recess, too. Especially by 5th grade when the playground didn't hold my interest, I preferred to read. Only my teachers celebrated and encouraged it.\n\nWhat book was it? I love that your daughter reads her mom's old books. I have kept all my old favorites to pass along to my grandson.", "NTA.  As an avid reader what that teacher did was absurd and I don't care how little she is paid (actually I do but that doesn't apply here) and she should have listened to the parents.  Tell you cousin to get over herself.", "NTA. The teacher might be underpaid, but she also actively made her job harder by enforcing a rule that does not exist", "NTA.

One would think if she wasn't paid enough that she'd actually want to relax at recess instead of harassing children.", "As someone who works in a school I'm going with NTA. I mean fair enough ask a kid if they want to play but if they're not causing any harm just let them read a book.", "NTA. There was no need to take her book away.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's recess, not PE. I thought the point of recess is for kids to get free time to themselves.", "NTA - I\u2019m a teacher. Cleo\u2019s teacher is not making good decisions. Cleo sounds like an awesome kid!

The teacher overstepped big time and you stood up for Cleo.", "NTA. I did find the bit about 'the teacher isn't paid enough and I should've just accepted the rule' pretty comical. Your child should not be mistreated at school because a teacher isn't paid enough. \n\nYou did the right thing. The teacher was strangely out of line and lacking in compassion.

I was also an isolated child. I am indigenous mixed. As such, no kids would want to play or hang out with me since I was a mixed race and was considered dirty because my mother had darker skin. Today it is learning disabilities, but many years ago it was race. My parents let me read, but it did cause issues with social interactions as I did not develop social skills as quickly which caused issues for many years, especially in high school. In addition, as an adult, I got fat as I was not physically active enough which caused harm to my mental health and physical health. I should have gone running, playing, competing, etc. It was not until my 40s that I finally put those books down and lost that weight, got healthier, and conquered that depression. I really wish my parents could have encouraged me to be more active, instead of letting a kid do what they wanted to do. I was 10, like I had any idea what was good for me or my future?\n2. Recess is not free time. It is a time meant to be physically active or to socialize. These are two very important elements in any child's development. Cognition is very important as kids need to be able to communicate and socialize with their peers and learn how to get along, manage disputes, handle boundaries, etc. One out of three girls drops out of physical sports or activity by the time they are a teen. This means that if your child has not developed a good balance between sedentary isolated reading and active cooperative play, the teacher is trying to teach this. Free time is offered after school, probably at the library, where your child can read there after class. Libraries also offer this as well.\n3. Being active is something that can be taught. Teach her now! If not, she will learn to be on her ass while not having friends, or someone to love her, become obese, depressed, etc. like so many I know in their 30's. This teacher wants a better life for her student. You want your daughter to do what she wants. (not doing harm in reading is irrelevant).  If this is in the USA, I would think the pressure is higher for the teachers as they are teaching in a country renowned for childhood obesity. \n4. You justifying that there are only two months left in school just demonstrates that nothing matter, just do what you want. You taught your daughter the same. Rules don't matter. Health does not matter. Future goals do not matter. Her cognitive development does not matter - Just do what you want, so long as you think it causes no harm. You taught her entitlement.\n5. A teacher can make her own rules in the classroom.  If you do not like rules that apply, home-school her.\n6. What next?  A cell phone?\n7. Please look up the Indigenous Medicine Wheel: this is what most teachers are teaching. This means that every person and child should be balanced physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally. She is not getting the education or encouragement to do the physical part, which you now ended. This now means that her emotions, spirituality, and mental health will be more taxed as a result.\n\nI actually became a teacher as well. However, when parents intercede, there is not much a teacher can do. We wish to provide a balance for our kids to provide them with physical activity, mental health, spirituality or grounding, and emotional health. However, parents are bent out of shape and I've had parents berate me for giving their kids homework because their kids \"don't like it\".

I don't want to make children sound like plants or pets or anything, but omg they're so much fucking easier to care for. They're not constantly vying for attention (negative or positive) and you can bond with them so easily! Just ask them to tell you about the current book they're reading! Sometimes I go find a copy so I can read it and talk about it with them. Next thing you know, you've made a relationship with your student and if you're consistent, you'll become an adult they trust and that's so important bc sometimes they need to talk to an adult that's not their parent.\n\nI fucking wish I had more kids like that.

Her handwriting never recovered from even just one year of poor practice.", "Was your teacher a communist?", "It should also be said that the reason Cleo doesn't talk to the other kids in her grade is because they bullied her in the past and still ostracize her now, and this teacher's solution was to try and force her to approach them and potentially get rejected again.

It's been a LONG couple years for teachers. \nJust saying there's a lot that goes into a teacher's job, we have many different bosses and when both want something the other doesn't, we get caught in the crossfire.

She did, and I while I don\u2019t remember the particulars of the conversation, I do remember she left me alone about whatever book I brought in from home and was reading after that. (Take that, Mrs. Cartwright!) \n\nRemember those reading comprehension tests you used to have to take? Yeah, the first time I did one of those they handed me a book at my grade-level. Somehow I was never good enough for PACE English Lit until middle school, but I was consistently reading and comprehending books 2-3 levels above from the time I was six, and those tests proved that. Our education system is sometimes so focused on forcing kids into neat little boxes that they ignore what\u2019s actually helpful to the child, and I think that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here. The teacher thinks that a healthy, \u201cnormal\u201d child should be running around and playing at recess, not reading. And so rather than airing her concerns to the parents and listening to their feedback, she takes it upon herself to \u201cfix\u201d the kid. \n\nOP can tell the teacher from me, a bookworm and former Lonely Child at school, that reading instead of playing didn\u2019t hinder my social skills. What did hinder me and make me incredibly anxious was being Othered and not permitted to be myself. And it gave other kids a free pass to tease me because I wasn\u2019t doing what I was \u201csupposed to.\u201d God, I have a huge amount of respect for teachers 99.9% of the time but then I see a teacher pull a stunt like this and it really gets me going. Like when did reading become a BAD thing????", "9th grade I used \"clandestine\" like 3 times in a presentation, and the student teacher called my parents to tell them I had plagiarized my report.

I said this in another comment, but this is a very important hill to die on. I would have been so bored and hated reading had I been restricted like some librarians and teachers do.

Who exactly would push?  My alcoholic mother? Go away troll.", "Yeah, I agree, the teacher shouldn't have done this. I'm asking, if they feel pressured by the school to stop the child reading, as mentioned might be the case in the comment I replied to, why didn't they go straight to the parents and ask them for documentation, or to email the principal so they didn't feel caught in the middle?

She's in 2nd grade and reads at a 5th grade level. At first her teacher would make her pick books based in their grade. Until she brought the book back 20 minutes later and asked for another because she was done and bored with that one. Her teacher made her tell her what it was about. She pretty much recited it word for word. After that, she was allowed to get any book she wanted.

If you need to spin around in a circle for 15 minutes while chanting numbers to yourself, recess is your time to do that. If you want to sit there and read during recess, recesses your time to do that. Recess is how kids reset and everyone does that differently.", "NTA. The teacher (who is the asshole) was imposing a very neurotypical view of the world on a neurodivergent kid, and ND kids already get that shit all the time. That attitude is the opposite of inclusive. As ND and a bookworm myself, I often needed the time during recess to decompress from classes, which were overwhelming. I can very well imagine the anxiety that teacher induced in your kid - not only that she did 'wrong', but also that she was 'wrong' (for needing quiet time), not to mention the confiscation of a beloved object used for support.\n\nQuite honestly, this is not even what I'd define as 'causing a stink'. I think you were very straightforward and polite in your approach.\n\nSchool staff mentality is a bit worrying, if defending the right of a kid to be different and questioning the status quo is seen as causing a stink.

I assume that means the same teacher played a role in doing this. Correct? \n\nIf so, I hope you contacted the principal to say thank you. Stopping bullying is TOUGH and parents should definitely be recognizing teachers who manage to bring it under control. Y T A if you didn't do this. \n\nAlso, please read-again and find the posts about how teachers are being encouraged to encourage kids to be social. That's very important.", "NTA but hopefully you approached in a positive and kind way before it became confrontational, as it sounds like they meant well", "Info: did you listen to the teachers reasoning at all? What was her logic for taking the book?", "Yes, YTA. Nobody is going to tell you that because your daughter also shouldn't have been in trouble; this isn't about the rule. What makes it a \"YTA\" is that you made no effort to determine the whys and wherefores of the response, what goals were the teacher was trying you achieve, and treated the teacher like a servant rather than a member of the team (that includes you) in providing the best education to the child.\n\nWhat rules there are and aren't aside, there are likely a dozen different learning outcomes the teacher is trying to achieve for the class, and your child in particular. They did not do what they did in the best way possible (they may also be the AH), but there are socialization and integration concerns as well; recess is likely not free time for the teacher. The teacher's workload is likely too large; they require cooperation and goodwill from the parents if they are going to get this done.\n\nSo what happened was, your child came home with a complaint, which you instantly believed in its entirety. You made no effort to even listen to the teacher, let alone cooperate or see yourself as a team working in the best interests of your child. You went straight to their boss and registered a complaint, and focused on being a rules lawyer.\n\nWhether you agree this makes you the AH or not, here's the practical outcome what will happen. Every teacher in that school now knows you are not a team player. You're not willing to listen to any reasoning, nor are you interested in working with them. If there is anything extra concern or problem with your daughter's education or care, they will second-guess whether they should call you; nobody wants to call 'that parent'. Messagers are routinely blamed by parents, and teachers are aware the principal won't back them up. You wanted your daughter left alone, and they will be; you'll get the state or provincial required reports, standard notifications, and anything that should be 'nipped in the bud' or preemptive actions will wait until there are formal concerns that can be written and communicated in a formal way. There are a lot of things teachers can worry about that can turn out to be nothing, but can also turn out to be very concerning; the teacher isn't going to act on them if they believe you're going to be in the next day angry. Worse, they're not going to breathe a word of it.  If they're a US teacher especially; they're just trying to survive and do the best they can.\n\nYou can fix this; one mistake does not a bad relationship make, but the ball is only in your court. They're not going to make the effort now that they have had your response. The teacher may turn out to have been thoroughly wrong, and would improve/update with a calm supportive discussion, or they could turn out to be the mean archetype you expected them to be, but you've built a self-fulfilling prophecy here. Without talking to them and building a relationship you're not going to find out, and they don't have time or support to do it for you.\n\nThe most important time to have adults in the room is when something hasn't gone well with communication, and something *always* goes wrong with communication. You've behaved like a toddler, and ensured a reputation at the one place your daughter needs the most support. At least make the effort to find out if the teacher is trying to act in the best interests of your child before going scorched earth.", "I\u2019m a teacher. So I say a little YTA, basically just for coming in hot and yelling at the teacher. Couldn\u2019t you have sent an email or text? \n\nKids have to sit all day in school and it seems like she just wanted your daughter to get a little movement in. I\u2019m assuming she was at outdoor recess. Is that so bad that she would be thinking of the whole child not just her academic performance?  Especially if she has hyperactive ADHD. She only has the context of school (not home) and sees how much the kids sit.  Also she didn\u2019t know the background of the book. It is weird she kept it overnight, I would have just gave it back right after recess. But did you need to come in and instantly yell at her? How about asking nicely and mentioning it\u2019s your wife\u2019s book. Or sending an email or text the night before requesting it back. I imagine she got defensive quick because of it and that\u2019s why she stuck with her \u201crule\u201d and you had to take it to the principal. \n\nYou became \u201cone of those parents\u201d by not asking nicely. She\u2019s sees your daughter 6 hours a day you could at least treat her with a little respect. You weren\u2019t wrong but your approach made YTA a little. Also this could have been a moment for you to teach your child to advocate for herself.", "I'm not sure if I should vote NAH or ESH. \n\nThe teacher may have just wanted your daughter to get some exercise.  Most of the conferences I have attended the past five years have really stressed the importance of 20 minutes of vigorous exercise or play followed by 45 to an hour of instruction depending on the age of the child.  That vigorous movement helps their little brains focus better and retain the information they are learning.  This is especially true for children with ADHD.  My school has totally changed the structure of the day because of this research and have added additional recess periods hoping it will help our students.\n\nI think it would have been best if the teacher had called and talk to you about why she took the book away.  But honestly, she probably didn't think you would have a big issue with it or simply got busy and forgot.  You kind of suck because it sounds like you went in really hot and didn't even give her a chance to explain why she took the action she did.  People really need to just try having reasonable conversations.   Teaching is a hard job, and it doesn't pay well give the years of education needed.  It's fine to go after someone for something really egregious, but I have seen people on here go after teachers for really small things.", "Oh nooooo children READING in their free time?!

Has your daughter been asked or told before that she needs to play rather than read at recess? I don\u2019t think your daughter is wrong for wanting to read but from the teachers standpoint Cleo is likely sitting at her desk for hours up to this point and her body needs to physically move. That being said I think this is a dumb hill to die on for the teacher but I do think you could have been a little more open in your discussion with the teacher before you jumped to the principal. You don\u2019t list any \u201cdefenses\u201d the teacher tried to explain but it is very likely she is receiving push to make sure the kids are moving at recess for a myriad of reasons. I know when I was a teacher I had a parent try to jump down my throat because I required my students to write the answers to questions in complete sentences and not use any unidentified pronouns ( I.e She won the election). This parent was made that I required my students to use good writing skills in my social studies classroom and in his words \u201cwhat does writing have to do with social studies.\u201d I think you are a soft ah in this because you reacted to your daughter\u2019s reaction rather than the situation itself.

The teacher shouldn\u2019t have taken away the book, but she was probably just concerned about her not having any friends in school. She wasn\u2019t trying to harm her.
