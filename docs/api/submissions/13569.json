She plays soccer, takes swim lessons and will play outside a lot with neighborhood kids. She\u2019s very social. Most of her friends are from outside of school.\n\nAt school, however, she struggles making friends. Cleo has ADHD and was bullied in 3rd and 4th grade for some of that. While it was brought under control by 5th (current grade), these kids still don\u2019t play with her and pretty much ice her out. While I don\u2019t think they have to play with her, it also means that she doesn\u2019t socialize a lot at school. She\u2019s okay with this. \n\n\nHer teacher says our daughter often plays alone at recess or reads.  My wife and I were not very concerned and explained she\u2019s very social and active afterwards.\n\nCleo is a huge reader. She\u2019s currently reading her way through my wife\u2019s collection of books from her childhood. She loves them and treasures them, knowing they were her mama\u2019s and wants to take great care of them. She came home on Tuesday, very upset and worried her mom would be upset with her. I asked why and she said her teacher took her book away and won\u2019t give it back until tomorrow. When pressed for more information , she said she was reading at recess. Her teacher walked over, took the book and told her to go play. My daughter begged for her book back and the teacher refused.\n\nI quickly assured Cleo that she wasn\u2019t in trouble and even called my wife at work to have her back me up. It was quite concerning that she was so afraid, as my wife isn\u2019t one to fly off the handle. She\u2019s always gentle with Cleo. As suspected, my wife assured her she wasn\u2019t upset and that Cleo did zero wrong.\n\nThe next day, I brought Cleo to school early and walked her to class, no one but the teacher was there. I told the teacher to give me the book. She obliged and tried to defend herself. I told her to save it and she had no right. There is no rule that Cleo *has* to do physical activity at recess and we expressed no concern. The teacher said she was allowed to set boundaries for her class but I pointed out recess was free time. It\u2019s not like Cleo is reading during math. We went back and forth, and finally I said I\u2019d be reaching out to the principal.\n\nThe issue was resolved quickly. I don\u2019t know the particulars, except the principal told me that Cleo is allowed to read at recess and unless she is actively harming someone or reading during a non-designated time, she wouldn\u2019t have any more books confiscated. My wife and I were pleased. Cleo even more so.\n\nMy cousin is a teacher at this school, just a different grade. She says what I did is \u201chot gossip\u201d in the teacher\u2019s lounge and that I have been marked as \u201cone of those parents\u201d. She says the teacher isn\u2019t paid enough and I should\u2019ve just accepted the rule. When I pointed out we only have 2 more months left at this school (Cleo is our only and starts junior high in august), that\u2019s not a concern. \n\nMy wife and I feel justified, but we are wondering if I\u2019m an asshole?", "created_utc": 1680200623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126v46f/aita_for_becoming_that_parent_by_causing_a_stink/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off your cousin is a AH for engaging in \u201chot gossip\u201d instead of sticking up for family. Secondly Cleo reading at recess is in no way wrong. She can spend her recess how she see fit and if reading a book helps her recharge, that\u2019s her choice. It\u2019s good you stood up for her and let her know you had her back. As for the teacher, major AH because how is her reading affecting you? She needs to be somewhere recharging herself. Not being a playground bully to your kid.", "NTA.  There is a difference between being \"one of those parents\" and standing up for you child.  It's good she knows you are there for her.", "The only way that I could see any reason that the teacher would do it (which is still wrong) is if Cleo had been antsy and acting out and she thought maybe activity at recess would calm her down for the afternoon.

As an avid reader what that teacher did was absurd and I don't care how little she is paid (actually I do but that doesn't apply here) and she should have listened to the parents.

I mean fair enough ask a kid if they want to play but if they're not causing any harm just let them read a book.", "NTA. There was no need to take her book away.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's recess, not PE. I thought the point of recess is for kids to get free time to themselves.", "NTA - I\u2019m a teacher. Cleo\u2019s teacher is not making good decisions. Cleo sounds like an awesome kid!

Bet she doesn\u2019t read let alone follow IEP\u2019s either.", "NTA. I was Cleo. I read a lot. I can't imagine if a teacher did what yours did. I understand teachers are overworked and underpaid on a criminal level, but they should also understand how group dynamics work. \n\nYou think kids just sit off to the side because *they* don't like anyone? Ummm no. The loners are loners because no one likes them. Telling them to go \"insert\" themselves is like a social death sentence.", "NTA. If the teacher isn't \"paid enough\" then why is she interfering with a child's free time?", "NTA you are well within your rights to defend your child. Fuck that teacher. There\u2019s enough of a literacy problem and now we have teachers actively discouraging reading? Brilliant. What a tool bag.", "NTA. The teacher isn\u2019t paid to mess with kids she did that to fun and got called out on it.", "NTA", "NTA.  Teacher was out of her lane.", "NTA. Screw the power tripping teacher. Glad you had your daughter\u2019s back. Keep up the good parenting.\n\nI say this as a kid who got in trouble a lot in school for nonsense reasons, and my parents had to back me up.", "Nta one of what parents?  Parent's who stand up for their kids when the teacher does something stupid?  It's not like you demanded she be allowed to smack someone across the mouth.  She's sitting there reading.  Not causing issues.\n\nI get the feeling that her teacher was one of those ahole kids in school and it's carried over.", "Wow. NTA even the slightest. That teacher may be underpaid and miserable but had no right to do that and upset your kid. You did good", "NTA, the teacher should have minded her own business if she doesn\u2019t get paid enough to deal with the parents. The daughter wasn\u2019t causing harm to anyone. Leaving her alone wouldn\u2019t have hurt anyone.", "Genuinely, thank you for the concern but we already had her tested. She doesn\u2019t parallel play and will actively play with the other kids. She showed other symptoms and actually didn\u2019t intend to test her for adhd, just autism. It was the evaluator who said she wasn\u2019t autistic but had adhd.", "I had a teacher in 7th grade give me an incomplete because I did the final book report on 1984, not required reading until high school, because I had READ all those books for 7th grade years before.\n\nI ended up in the next semester in a remedial reading class.  Finished the entire semesters lessons in 1 week.  I became the unofficial \"teachers aid\" for the rest of the semester because it was too late to put me in a real literature class.", "Honestly though, this is a case where being one of \"those parents\" is worth it, to hopefully stop the power tripping before it gets worse and gets your daughter bullied more. Because from (sad) experience, I doubt the teacher would be satisfied with her playing by herself and would try and force her to \"play\" with her bullies.", "He wouldn't have had to reach the principal if the teacher had apologized and accepted her mistake. And taking a kid's book is really really wierd.", "While I wholeheartedly agree with it being pushed or suggested, it\u2019s still not mandatory. At least not at my daughter\u2019s school, I checked the handbook. So to me, it\u2019s not fair to take a book.\n\nWe also were just as much invested in ending the bullying. We had several meetings with teachers and the principal, even some of the parents. The issue was, no one ever saw it happening. It wasn\u2019t until a group slipped up and did something at recess that a teacher witnessed that action was taken and luckily, whatever punishment was doled out, was enough to stop it.", "Massively disagree. Recess is free-time. They have gym classes for mandatory physical education. You have group work for socializing. Kids are given free time because that's what they need to decompress and be more productive. Some kids decompress by playing some just want to sit and be left alone. There is no requirement for how to spend free-time. When I was school we had indoor recess on bad weather days. Reading and coloring were one of the approved activities.", "These are great points", "I was reading Slaughterhouse five, misery, the stand and other \"Adult\" books in middle school (I read a lot because I had no friends). The complaints I was getting from teachers were similar, \"You're too far ahead, the other children can't keep up, why are you reading at a college level, this book is banned how did you get it?\". It was more of the teachers being impressed I could read so well in seventh grade rather than a situation of why am I reading period.", "Ha, this was me with The Haunting of Hill House during my junior year. I got too excited to continue reading past what the class was at, and when I was mentioning to one of my teacher, I was told that it was great that I was enjoying the book, but to make sure not to say anything while everyone else was still reading it and still keep up with the classwork/discussion. It was like I was told not to be a spoiler alert. XD", "Hahaha, my daughter has struggled with this too. She actually finished the book weeks before the class was due to. I told her to just pretend to be on track with everyone else.", "Yeah.  Seems like theft really.", "Everyone involved in this \u201chot gossip\u201d is showing how unprofessional they are. Not worth another visit to the Principal, but good to know that both your AH cousin and the teacher are judgy AH gossips. Avoid accidentally feeding the gossip train around those two.", "Maybe, or maybe this teacher just likes to be in control and is aghast that a child is not running wild at recess. As a parent of a child with ADHD, o can assure you that teachers are not shy about telling you that your child is too active. They wouldn\u2019t have waited to take a book away at recess to address it. \n\nOP, don\u2019t let yourself get shamed into being quiet and not speaking up when a teacher crosses a line. Poor salary or not, the teachers actions were completely inappropriate and that\u2019s why the principal addressed it like they did. The teachers like to gossip because it\u2019s easier to join the collective \u201cWoe is me! Being a teacher is hard and these parents helicopter so much!\u201d than to reflect on whether they let their ego, or even plain burnout, allow them to make a poor decision.\n\nNTA. Please always stick up for your daughter when someone treats her wrong, regardless of their title", "Exactly, her being paid enough doesn't have anything to do with her going on a power trip and confiscating students belongings when they aren't even doing anything wrong. Parents are definitely NTA", "Teacher was also dumb to keep the book overnight. \n\nYou never keep anything like that overnight, you give it back to the student at the end of your class period with them, or take it to the office to hold onto. \n\nI don\u2019t care what item it was, I\u2019d have been in there kicking up shit for any teacher keeping my kid\u2019s stuff overnight.", "\"Young lady, this is a public school - we simply cannot have you doing additional learning and development\"", ">Random nonsensical rules are also not needed in a school\n\nYeah, reading this post sure reminded me why I hated school as a kid \ud83d\ude44", "Nope. The teacher has no reason or right to discourage a child from reading during their free time, especially a child that is ostracized by her classmates. The teacher has been made aware that the daughter has other social and spots activities, and 100% knows that there is a disconnect between her and the other students. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of teachers fall in line with their main group of students and will, knowingly or unknowingly, join in the torment of a kid that doesn\u2019t quite fit in. If the girl doesn\u2019t have playmates at school, she is not going to be welcomed into a group activity at recess. \n\nIf a teacher notices a social issue with a student, especially something as prevalent as it sounds like it has been with this girl, they should reach out to the parents or bring it up during a parent/teacher meeting. OP deciding to talk with the principal because the teacher tried to defend herself-the teacher should have apologized and opened a dialogue, because that\u2019s what you do when you mess up. The principal could potentially have been avoided if the teacher had owned it.", "A kid reading at recess is not a problem.", "I understand your POV and also want to thank you for the addition. That makes sense now, looking back. She truly is a kid who doesn\u2019t do much to get in trouble, so I can understand the anxiety.", "Teacher isn\u2019t TA for trying to resolve a problem. She\u2019s TA for even thinking there is a problem to begin with. \n \nShe\u2019s also TA for taking a students property beyond the timeline of the \u201cproblem\u201d and for not informing the parents she did so. \n\nOP also did reach out and ask for the book to be returned and said that they had no problem with their daughter reading during free time. \n\nOP, NTA.", "Grade 7 english teachers are something else - mine gave me an incomplete on a progress report because I hadn't given a presentation. Why? She forgot to put me in the schedule and wouldn't let me present until after reports were sent out. \n\nI was also the only kid allowed to go to the high school library to pick out books to read in elementary school, because I was so far above the reading level. So an incomplete in english was extra laughable for me, lol.", "And some people think our kids aren\u2019t constantly being let down by our educational systems", "Of course it\u2019s not mandatory, but very much strongly suggested for many reason. It\u2019s very important children physically move, engage during school hours. \nmaybe teacher after so many \u2018skipped\u2019 recess toke away 1 time the book. You could have found a middle ground. School can\u2019t be only making our children 100% happy sometime a pushed in the uncomfortable zone is a must. \nAgain no AH for advocating for her, but for construing a teacher without listening to her reasoning and find a more healthy solution.", "Right? Especially with not giving it back at the end of the day or something. At my school that was almost always the thing, unless it was a weapon (pocket knives counted), in which case a parent had to pick it up. But for general distractions, electronic devices, loud fidget toys, etc., the student was always given it back before they left for the day", "Someone seems to have toke away more than 1 time your books, too \ud83e\udd2d", "You\u2019re missing the point about recess. That\u2019s free time for kids to relax and enjoy themselves. It should be 100% about the kids enjoying that time as long as they aren\u2019t being destructive. There is an entire class dedicated to getting active, PE. If she was reading during gym class, take the book. That would be appropriate. Not so much during the small amount of free time given to kids during the school day.", "My grammar? Oh English is nOt my first language. Sorry \ud83d\ude1e", "Please re read guidelines for school recess in elementary  schools. FREE Physical activity (PE is organized physical activity) and FREE interaction with peers (again group work are organized activities) are pretty much the point of it. You give a social developing child a free time to interact socially and physically on their term and choice. Teacher supervise and should step in when those choices become dangerous, not socially-school acceptable and correct. A kid that skip any free interaction with her peers I will be surprised if the teacher wouldn\u2019t address it. Then sure want to relax few times, read a book, sun bath on a bench go, but again the social and physical aspect at elementary level is the point of it and why it remain obligatory in those grades."]}
