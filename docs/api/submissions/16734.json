I imagine she's able to attend to expenses more readily and able to keep them out of debt -- while also not losing funds to paying interest on debt.", "She said in one of the comments the debts were credit cards debts from when she was unemployed for a few months. They were grocery purchases. So going back to what u/ohiogirl22 said\u2026 what is happening with the money they are saving on their mortgage?", "I suspect that, which is why I didn't judge, but it'd still be nice to know.\n\nWhat really frustrates me is the lack of financial transparency with her children.  Honest financial conversations should always be shared with the children so that they grow up with financial awareness.", "Oh, OP edited it. All that stuff at the bottom was not in the original post.", "It's in the beginning - \"What are your debts?\" (It makes a big difference if it's her own student loan vs a gambling debt, for example). Whenever people are vague, it's a big question mark in my head.", "Where did she mention gambling debts?", "In California we have laws against that sort of thing. We had the same thing with elderly being priced out of their own homes so there is a cap on how much you can raise it and how much it could possibly be. In your grandmother's case if it's an affluent neighborhood then grandma got a nice chunk, She can move somewhere with a lower cost of living or even move in with family and help out with expenses.", "Thanks for this. I'm happy to see your debt was only 8k.\n\nHowever, if you had 110k to put towards your housing, why not only put 80k towards it, keep the mortgage going a couple more years, and offer each kid 10k for school? I know it's not a ton, but 10k could help with at least year 1...\n\nAlso if you now have no debt and no mortgage, why can't you help pay for some school? Just because you didn't use your inheritance to help with school doesn't mean you can't/shouldn't still help.", "Paying off the *entire* mortgage isn't the only way to reduce your payments, ffs.", "Children do not ask to be born. If one cannot manage adult responsibilities (and I am perfectly aware that is not always by choice, on the contrary, we can all end up in dire situations through no fault of our own) children should not have to suffer. But let\u2019s forget about that, it\u2019s a side note. Their grandfather wanted them to have that money for their own development. They don\u2019t have it. End of.", "One thing I can give my mother heavy credit for is being honest with us about money. We were broke (couldn\u2019t afford to live and didn\u2019t qualify for assistance) and we knew it.", "It's true! My parents tried to shield us until we were in our teens which I understand. But I honestly wish they started a bit earlier. I didn't really have a good understanding of finances until I was on my own. Finances and nutrition need to be talked about sooner! (I literally did not know how to read a nutrition label properly until I was 20 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)", "even without the edit at the end, where were you getting gambling debts from?", "She says it was credit card debt in her only reply. Which is easy to accrue when you you're unemployed. \n\nBut if you have debts you have debts. No matter the reason, clearing them is a good idea.", "Or she didn\u2019t itemize all of her debt because it\u2019s not relevant? Could be credit card debt for car repairs, stuff the kids need, house repairs, it\u2019s a big leap to gambling debt.", "The post I am replying to mentions it.  OP does not.", "I think she\u2019s still paycheck to paycheck even after paying off debts and mortgage", "No, he wanted his daughter to have the money to cover debts, a house and then also to help with college. It's not clear that he even left enough to completely cover college for any of them.\n\nIf he wanted his grandchildren to have the money for college, he could have made that clear and could have left that to them instead of his daughter.", "You aren't wrong. Personally I saw paying off debts as helping the children too. (Far better than a parent going bankrupt. Which sucked to live through). But she was given the money tor 3 places and ran out. I assume anyway. But none of your statements are wrong either. I don't know if OP was at that kind of risk.", "I didn't say there was gambling debts. I said -\n\n>What were your debts\n\nthen I gave \"good debt\" example (mortgage) vs \"bad debt\" example (gambling). Either way, the child has a right to her feelings.", "I would say that is relevant, which is why I asked.  If the parent \"blew through\" an inheritance in an irresponsible way (gambling) that is quite different than a car repair.\n\nI said NAH based on how it's written, b/c the daughter is entitled to her feels.", "This! I'd guess that the grandfather didn't know how much OP owed and thought there'd be money left over after debts and mortgage to help with education costs. Perhaps her father had unrealistic expectations of how far the money would go. Anyway, the point is, if OP hadn't used the money to pay her debts and her mortgage, her family would have been homeless.  How would her daughter  have liked that? People saying a college education is more useful or a better investment than a house are not thinking clearly. Food and shelter are NECESSARY to live; a degree isn't. Besides, numerous kids go to college or university without their parents funding it. They work for a year, go for a year. They go part-time and work part-time. They get loans, grants, bursaries, and scholarships. They choose more affordable schools. Could OP have made a better choice for her kids' father? Probably, but you can't foretell the future, and financial issues can crop up when you least expect them. NTA.", "What I am thinking is: if the OP really was in such a bad situation, the OP could have used part of the money for debt/mortgage and give part of the money to the children. But it just so happens that the OP is now mortgage free, debt free, while the kids have basically nothing\u2026 What I found striking was the statement regarding the fact that the children were told \u201csince they were young\u201d they won\u2019t be able to go far away for college. There was not even an intention to make an effort to give them a better future. Which is sad.", "Sure the child has a right to feelings but nobody is owed anything.  Jealousy is a dangerous feeling.  Understanding what priorities are versus feeling like your mom stole from you is important.  Saving for college falls lower on the list than having a home, food and stability.  Not sure my first thought when someone claims debt is wasting of money.  It is very easy to go into debt with three kids.", "You're probably right, yes."]}
