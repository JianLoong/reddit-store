She lives with a relative now and she\u2019s our neighbor. We\u2019ve known her for 2 years now. I met the relative (70F) and she told me that she\u2019s very careful about the people who interact with the children. Anyway, during these two years the neighbor\u2019s kid and my daughter play outside for an hour or two every now and then. I (35F) used to watch them but now they play on the driveway while I supervise them from the window every now and then. The neighbor can see them too since she has cameras. \n\nToday my husband (36) decided to watch them outside while he sat inside one of our vehicles. He has watched them maybe once before and briefly. Today for some reason I thought it would look pretty creepy/weird for a grown man sitting in his vehicle with the windows rolled down while he supervises the girls play but nonetheless I didn\u2019t say anything. 30 minutes went by and I started to worry about how things would look like. I couldn\u2019t go outside since I was in the middle of cooking. Anyway, I told my husband to come inside to help me with the food and he said no. I insisted and he still said no. I finally told him what was going through my mind and he became bothered and uncomfortable.\n\nI told him about the neighbor\u2019s situation which I didn\u2019t discuss before because it\u2019s their private life. But now I needed to give him some context. My husband got mad and he raised his voice. He was very rude. I used to work for child protective services so I know how prevalent false allegations are. \n\nAITA for caring about what the neighbors might think? Too paranoid?

Someone calls the cops, he shows them his ID as proof that he lives there, and they say \"have a nice day\" ? \n\nStatistically speaking, mothers are more likely to kidnap children than fathers are in family abduction cases. And women are often used in trafficking kidnaps because they're more likely to be viewed as \"innocent\" and can more easily play off the \"I was trying to help this lost child\" card if they get caught. \n\nI wouldn't think twice if I saw a dad casually watching from a driveway. I mean, how dumb would that \"kidnapper\" have to be to sit parked in full view with the windows down so everyone can see their face, in a neighborhood where the houses are close enough that multiple people could be watching the same scene from their windows? \n\nI'm more creeped out by the parents that watch from inside their houses tbh. It's typically frowned on to gaze into someone's home so you often don't even know if you're being watched, and if you ARE they could also be doing creepy shit like taking photos or touching themselves. \nNot saying that's what you're doing or what I suspect of your neighbor, but if you're going to be paranoid about things being viewed as \"creepy\" you're just as likely to be thought of as the creepy one in some people's minds.", "YTA.

If my daughter came home and told me her friends father sat in the car watching them play on the driveway I would think that was really odd.

She lives with a relative now and she\u2019s our neighbor. We\u2019ve known her for 2 years now. I met the relative (70F) and she told me that she\u2019s very careful about the people who interact with the children. Anyway, during these two years the neighbor\u2019s kid and my daughter play outside for an hour or two every now and then. I (35F) used to watch them but now they play on the driveway while I supervise them from the window every now and then. The neighbor can see them too since she has cameras. \n\nToday my husband (36) decided to watch them outside while he sat inside one of our vehicles. He has watched them maybe once before and briefly. Today for some reason I thought it would look pretty creepy/weird for a grown man sitting in his vehicle with the windows rolled down while he supervises the girls play but nonetheless I didn\u2019t say anything. 30 minutes went by and I started to worry about how things would look like. I couldn\u2019t go outside since I was in the middle of cooking. Anyway, I told my husband to come inside to help me with the food and he said no. I insisted and he still said no. I finally told him what was going through my mind and he became bothered and uncomfortable.\n\nI told him about the neighbor\u2019s situation which I didn\u2019t discuss before because it\u2019s their private life. But now I needed to give him some context. My husband got mad and he raised his voice. He was very rude. I used to work for child protective services so I know how prevalent false allegations are. \n\nAITA for caring about what the neighbors might think? Too paranoid? I know that my husband just really wanted some fresh air and he wanted to make sure that our daughter is safe but things can be misconstrued.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Him supervising the entire playtime is weird and it sounds like maybe he doesn\u2019t actually participate in parenting often enough to realize that the girls are not 4.", "Right?

A camera won\u2019t stop a stranger from abducting them, you\u2019d think given the traumatic history they would be glad for an adult to keep a closer watchful eye on them.

If they were crawling around in the car it would be one thing but I can\u2019t see how *anyone* would read this situation as anything but benign", "I'd be interested to know where the car was parked.

I was wearing a back pack and a pony tail. Ugh.\n\nUntil men become aware of the ways their behavior aligns with predators they need to accept they will be seen and treated as predators.\n\nI mean, the neighbor kid was likely abused by someone she trusted in the home. It would be a super small thing for OP\u2019s husband to think about that before watching the poor kid from his car for hours.\n\nThe number of people in the comments caping for predatory behavior is sad.", "Side note, it's best to have open clear discussion on these types of things anytime an everytime.\n Yet as you have noticed it feels horrible having ur partner accuse you of something. As an individual an more so with a partner we often forget they are another person.\n\nI would be absolutely destroyed if anyone did that to me as a father and an Uncle. Guys catch hell for a lot, an he needs you to be his pillar as much as you do him.", "Well you couldn\u2019t have known how you felt until you saw the situation. Maybe you were being a bit paranoid, but you are also working with your experience as a former CPS employee. Also I\u2019m not sure what sort of vibe you got from the neighbors. You should go with your gut in situations like this and explain to your husband what you\u2019re thinking and allow him to weigh in on whether it\u2019s worth the risk. He might think you\u2019re being ridiculous but at least you said your part.", "Perhaps I have the wrong image in my head", "Good!", "And if anyone asks if he lives there, your daughter isn't able to verify that's her dad and he lives there? He has no identification stating his address (it should be on the car insurance at the very least)? You can't turn the stove off to go outside and say \"that's my husband, everything is fine\"?

She said she also met the girls guardians and it seemed like she got some sort of weird vibe. The husband hasn\u2019t met them yet. Perhaps it was an overreaction but wanting to protect your husband out of an abundance of caution doesn\u2019t make you an asshole imo.

I have two young kids myself, and, thank you gender roles, there are a decent number of women, especially older women in my experience, who are very much of the mindset that, I don\u2019t know, \u2018I was a mum so I know mumming, so babies are my domain\u2019. Also \u2018babies are a woman thing, and I\u2019m a woman, so this is my thing.\u2019 And seeing babies as eventual persons rather than already complete persons in their own right. It\u2019s weird and intrusive and I completely agree not ok. \n\n Touching pregnant stomachs without asking, also very much more a woman thing.\n\nBut really, it all comes back to the same problematic attitude: women have babies, men have women. \n\nAnd I do want to say, the attitude of \u2018men are creeps until otherwise proven\u2019 is I\u2019m absolutely certain an unpleasant experience, I hear you there. And, it\u2019s also extremely not personal. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong, and in a lot of scenarios the women with that attitude don\u2019t think you specifically have done anything wrong either. It\u2019s just that being wrong about assuming the worst is a lot more low stakes than being wrong about assuming the best. \n\n\u2018All men are creeps\u2019 on the other hand, is 100% unhelpful garbage, and f that s.", "I 100% get what you are saying.

There is nothing inherently weirder about monitoring your kids from the car versus the porch! You\u2019re still just passively watching the kids.
