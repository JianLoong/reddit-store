{"id": 24706, "submission_id": "15rouu9", "title": "AITA for kicking my mother out of our family restaurant?", "selftext": "I (F, 19) lived in Seoul, Korea for a few years when I was little, but soon my whole family moved to Brooklyn, except my grandma (fathers side)  who was still in Seoul, struggling with her family business. My mother asked her to come live with us in Brooklyn, so after a month and a lot of consideration, she sold her biz for a good amount of money and came to us. My grandma looked so tired sitting at home all day, so I asked her why she wouldn\u2019t open another cafe, or restaurant here. She seemed really attracted to the idea, my dad is a real estate agent too so we actually made it happen. I did. alot of advertising on social media, advertising it as a small, family owned Korean bbq+hotpot place. An okay amount of people coming by, just enough to make a good percentage of profit every month. Our most popular offer was the all you can eat Korean bbq and hotpot for 20 bucks. We didn\u2019t hire any chefs, just 5 waiters/ staff to help customers and stay at the till. The \u2018chefs\u2019 were Me, my grandma, and my grandma from my mother\u2019s side. We loved cooking together so much too, and my grandma would ask people about her food when they finished eating, she loved feeding people. My mother started checking in on the place, watching customers etc, she was rlly skeptical of stealing. So one day, this couple comes in requesting a buffet, they are now eating after paying and stayed for about an hour just eating , which was no problem for us, since my gma supplied the meat from markets in Korea, amounting to way less than store bought. My mother was now very obviously staring at this couple, I thought it was just her being skeptical again. As soon as I went back into the kitchen, I heard shouting. My mother was shaming this couple, especially the lady, for eating so much. She screamed \u2018You\u2019re taking money from a poor business that is barely getting by.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t true. We were getting by great. The lady literally shedded a few tears by the time I went to intervene. Atm I didn\u2019t hesitate to ask my mother to leave, when she didn\u2019t listen I told her she couldn\u2019t come back here for at least a week until she learnt to behave. I feel guilty for saying that to my mother, but just know that wasn\u2019t the only time she made comments at customers for eating, although I would usually just ask her to stop instead of kicking her out, I had enough this time. I apologized to the couple so many times, and told them the meal was on the house. I also told them they could come back another time and it\u2019ll be half off for both of them. The lady looked to feel a bit better and they thanked me, and left. My mother hasn\u2019t spoken to me and is trying to convince my grandma to stop paying me. (I\u2019m going to Uni next year, I\u2019m on a gap year right now) and I\u2019m only being payed 4 dollars an hour. I don\u2019t understand where she\u2019s coming from, but I can\u2019t help but feel guilty. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: \nmy mother walked in a few minutes ago, we had a short argument, she threatened to sue our own business for denying her entry. I don\u2019t even know how that would work but im so upset at her, but I can tell she\u2019s very upset too that i just made her leave again when she said that", "created_utc": 1692095383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rouu9/aita_for_kicking_my_mother_out_of_our_family/", "score": 131, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom was way out of line. It's a good thing you were in, as someone who has a very disturbed relationship with food and is working on this, it would do so much damage to my progress if a stranger would shout to me about eating too much.", "NTA.  If that couple or any witnesses decide to leave some negative reviews, your business is in trouble.  No way should your mother be allowed in the restaurant.", "NTA-  this behavior by her is kind of unhinged. I would want to know why she does that if it were me. If she was exceptionally poor back in Korea, that might explain it. However, explain to your mom that her behavior is a great way to go viral on social media for all the wrong reasons. It could sink the business.", "NTA - your mom is going to destroy the family business the way she acts.  She has to stay away from the restaurant at all costs.", "NTA. Your mom's intentions might have been good, but she was being mean and could easily hurt your business: all it takes is one bad review to mess things up. \n\nAlso, you have leeway because korean bbq for 20 bucks is AMAZING. Tempted to msg you for the address. \n\nSeriously people, if you have not had korean bbq, you are missing out. Shit, now I'm hungry.", "NTA\nBut the woman your mother was accusing, was she eating her unlimited buffet or packing in her handbag or something? If she was eating then your mother got no say as that what's the offer is, eat all you can.\nBut if she was packing the food instead of eating, then maybe you people need stricter customer policy for this.", "NTA\n\nIf you work in a business, you need to behave appropriately. If you need to intervene all the time, I understand you fully.", "NTA. Your mother was utterly disrespectful to a customer, and should not be allowed back in until she can understand this.", "NTA at all. With a small business like yours (especially one that\u2019s doing a lot of social media), one bad review can be fatal. Maybe you can get your mom\u2019s mother to talk to her and explain that she\u2019s putting the whole family at risk by acting like this? \n\nRE: your update, restaurants in NY can deny service to anyone, so long as it\u2019s not for a discriminatory reason (race, religion, etc). I worked at a few places that all had banned lists that included everyone from the guy who paid with counterfeit bills, to the lady who\u2019s kid made a huge mess, to a server\u2019s shitty ex. It\u2019s really common.", "Nta your mum should know better than to shame a paying customer", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think some people would find it charmingly quirky (you know, like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld), but when she brings a woman to tears, that spells trouble. I hope you find a way to rein her in.

All it would take is a couple of bad reviews to start losing business", "It's tempting to tell you to call the police when she comes in and causes a scene, but the family aspect muddy's the water. Who really owns the place? She could tell the cops that she's an owner.\n\nWhat does your dad think of all this? Surely as a businessman, he would see the wisdom of not harassing paying customers for what they are eating (especially in front of other customers). Can you get him to influence her to stay out?\n\nLastly, surprise, surprise. You have a history of ED and your mom is harassing customers for eating too much. Could there be a connection /s ?\n\nNTA", "I spoke to my dad, it\u2019s under my grandfather\u2019s name. Also my dad doesn\u2019t know about this \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. Your mom sounds exhausting. Tell her to sue away because in the US, we reserve the right to refuse service to ANYONE with very few exceptions. And her being the daughter of the owner and a mother of an employee isn't one of them. \n\nMORE IMPORTANTLY, the minimum wage in the State of New York is $15. And know that even if you are OK with it, if something happened and the state found our, your Grandma could face serious consequences (likely a large fine and she would be required to pay you the money you should have gotten.", "NTA. This is a painful and difficult spot to be in but your mother has no business being in contact with people in public if she's this detached from reality. She's visualizing situations that aren't happening and confronting people over her imagination. This isn't fair to your customers and certainly isn't far to the business you've helped create.", "Oh! well, I make really good in tips and I wouldn\u2019t call myself an employee if that makes sense? I babysit on weekends and I wanted to help my grandma for free but she insisted on min wage.", "You can trespass her.  Tell the police she isn\u2019t allowed to be at the business anymore.  If she shows up, she can be arrested.  Or at least let her know that\u2019s a possibility.  She doesn\u2019t have a right to be there just because she is related to anyone.   Good luck.

I live in Brooklyn and if you're comfortable advertising the restaurant's name here on Reddit my wife and I will check it out!", "In your update you said she wants to sue your business for denying her entry. That's not how that works! In fact you could call the police and have her trespassed if the owners or even the managers didn't want her there! Restaurants are not public places. Public places are like city streets and public parks, a restaurant is a privately owned business and the owners have the right to refuse service/ admittance to anybody they want. \n\nBut tell her go ahead and sue because that would be funny as hell! I'd love to hear what she says to a lawyer trying to get him to take the case. Lol", "NTA. Remind your mother that a buffet means \"all you can eat.\"   I doubt they will eat all the food that is supplied.  Only a glutton does that.  Tell mom that if she loses the restaurant business to the point that it shuts down, it will be her fault and no one else's.  You can tell your maternal grandmother that. Tell her to stop defending your mother's bad behavior.", "fs I\u2019ll dm it to you!! if you guys ever decide to come ask for sofi and I\u2019ll serve u guys lolll"]}
