If she persists, ask what their plan was before they found out you offered for your two friends to stay with you.\n\nThere won't be one. Then ask when they found out about your place, and who told them they could stay there.", "NTA\n\nZero obligation or responsibility here to help.", "NTA.. They asked. You answered. When someone asks, especially a friend, they should respect your answer regardless. If your friend is pissed because their 2 friends have no place to stay, that's no fault of yours. Obviously this friend isn't as good of a friend as you thought.", "NTA\n\nYoure good, you made the right call for all the right reasons.", "NTA. You have 4 other housemates. At the very least, you would need to check with them before having more people stay over since that many people would affect the whole house. \n\nAlso, lack of planning by people you don\u2019t know does not make for an obligation on your part.", "NTA. That's a big imposition, and your reasons are valid.  The 4 of them can split a hotel room now though....", "NTA, they booked the tickets knowing they had no solid plans of where they would be staying and your friend offered up your place without consulting you. \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence and you\u2019ve more than justified your answer.", "NTA\n\nSo they bought last minute tickets without anyplace to stay but it's your fault?  Nope!!  You noted they're quite rude so don't think they're going to accept any responsibility for their own poor decision making.  If your friend has a thing for one of these girls, that's why he's pissed but he is still spending the weekend in your crowded house and will see the situation in person.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t help them. The answer is no. It is their responsibility to solve their own problems, not yours. If your friend wants to take responsibility for her friend\u2019s problems, let her... but she can\u2019t hand you that problem to solve.\n\nbtw \u2014 I\u2019m guessing these friends bought tickets with the idea that they could stay at your house because your friend probably told them they could. Again, I\u2019m guessing but I think that\u2019s why she is pissed off.", "NTA. You're correct, they were extremely rude to somehow assume that two complete strangers are somehow your responsibility.", "\u201eMy friend is pissed because she said they have no other options for getting to the show\u201c\n\nSo why did they buy those tickets if they don\u2019t have any options to go to this show?

Either of your reasons is valid enough to decline and the school friend giving you a hard time over it isn\u2019t a friend.", "NTA", "NTA, they booked tickets to a show but they can\u2019t book an Airbnb or hotel.

So, you can be frustrated on your friend's behalf but you do not get to point it at me because the free accommodations you are getting aren't further expandable.", "NTA... Why would your friend think, 5 people in one bedroom is a good idea?", "Nta - \"that sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. You're still welcome to stay but I completely understand if you want to find alternative accommodation with those 2 friends - whatever works best for you\"", "NTA\n\nAll your points are valid, even one would be the reason to say no.\n\nThis friend is particularly entitled to think you have the room to host 2 extra people, people you do not even know/like.\n\nHer friends likely didn't check on accommodations because she told them that you'd allow them to stay with you, without asking first.\n\nThey can either find something or not go.", "NTA and your friend is being weird about this.\n\nTheir poor planning doesn't create an obligation for you.", "NTA.
