This was Sarah's first time drinking, and she probably overdid it because she casually mentions that she's been hanging out with Jared, my ex-boyfriend and the father of my kids, more often. I was immediately taken aback, but tried not to jump to conclusions and asked her for more information. She replied saying that they had just \u201chit it off\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s a cool guy\u201d.\n\nI thought it was strange, considering our history and that we have only been broken up for two months. Not to mention, we co-parent our child and have another one on the way. Sarah said it simply wasn\u2019t her problem and she\u2019s not the \u201cone single, pregnant, and broke at 20\u201d. This comment hurt, coming from my best friend, but I was able to keep my composure and ultimately moved on after she apologized.\n\nLast Friday, Jared came over to my place to take our daughter for the weekend. He didn\u2019t mention, however, that he would be bringing Sarah too. As soon as Jared and Sarah walked through the door, I was disoriented, but I tried not to create tension in front of my daughter.

Jared and Sarah were denied being anything other than friends, and told me that Jared was Sarah\u2019s ride home and Sarah suggested coming over because she wanted to see me and my ex had to make this stop anyway.\n\nTheir behavior was beginning to bother me, and I told them that I would prefer if they did not come to my house together again in the future. Jared argued back, claiming I was being controlling and he can decide who his friends are. Sarah made a comment about me, that was something along the lines of \"Maybe if you were more fun, he wouldn't need to look elsewhere.\"\n\nThat was the last straw for me. My immediate response was to tell them to leave, quite loudly and harshly. Since they\u2019ve left, I\u2019ve been replaying the scene in my mind and just feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and sadness. The situation made me feel uncomfortable and as if my best friend didn't even care about me, but maybe I could have handled it better.

You say that Sarah has been you best friend since high school. I beg to differ and will add that's it's probable she's never really been your friend. First, it didn't take long for her to start \"hanging out\" with the father of your children. It probably took even less time than you realize and may have even been hooking up with Jared before you broke up. \n\nShe didn't tell you because she drank too much, she did it because she was tired of waiting for you to find out on your own. In the same conversation, she sneered at you for being \"single, pregnant and broke at 20\" just to bury the knife in your back even deeper. That's not the behavior of someone who's ever actually been your friend. Her \"apology\" was bullshit and she did it so she could set the next trap for you.\n\nSarah showing up with Jared was calculated and if they were \"just friends\" she would've waited in the car so you didn't see her. She didn't come over to see you either, she's there to stake her claim and shove the knife just that much deeper. You have every right to ask that they not come to your house together, and it doesn't make you controlling at all and doesn't mean you're trying to pick his friends. You didn't demand, or even ask that they not spend time together. That's his guilty conscience showing. You made a simple request which should be easily honored just as a common courtesy. Her snide remark  was intended to hurt you and make you doubt yourself, but it also gives away the lie that they \"just friends\".\n\nI can give you a 100% guarantee that, they're not only sleeping together, but living together, at least part time and that Sarah is undoubtedly not you friend and honestly gives zero shits about you. Her life is all about making herself happy, any way she can, and causing others as much pain as possible along the way just for her own entertainment. I know the type quite well, one gave birth to me.\n\nDo yourself a few favors if you can, get a therapist, get a lawyer. If you live in the US, try Legal Aid. Finally, since you're Sarah's current target for emotional torture, be prepared for the chance that they may try for custody of you daughter and baby to use as weapons which is why I suggested the lawyer.\n\nNo one deserves to have to go through shit like this and I'm heartbroken that you are. I watched the female who birthed me do it to others way too many times.\n\nDo your best to not get drawn in by their power plays and games. Yelling at them to get out once is forgivable, more than that and it can be used against you. So, curl you toes, count slowly to 20, paint entertaining pics in your head, what ever you can do to keep yourself calm  when they're pushing your buttons that, if they notice, can be explained away by your pregnancy. Don't give them anything to shoot at, as it were.\n\nAlso keep a record of anything either of them does to hurt you more or get under your skin. Include date, time location and name(s). Keep it where it won't get ruined but where no one else but you can find it, not even your daughter. If possible (legal), get a voice recording of every interaction you have with them.

We need to stop giving those people more of ourselves. \n\nNow she has two kids so she isn\u2019t really going to be free of this guy-  but she does need to figure out how to set proper boundaries.\n\nKicking them out of the party was a good start.  She doesn\u2019t control who they date,  but she can absolutely stop accepting them into her house.  She\u2019s NTA but does have to start taking control of her actions.", "Yeah, no. I would have sympathy is she was unaware of his nature. But considering that she had had front row seats to everything with OP she knows, she's just a shit friend.", "There's no way Jared could manipulate a decent person into betraying her BFF like this.  Or saying 'that's why he's looking elsewhere' and other comments. \n\nSounds like Jared was happy to fuck Sarah on the side and keep it hidden, but *Sarah* is enjoying rubbing her superiority in OPs face.  She is likely being played and being told this is a real relationship, but being nasty to OP and gloating is all her.  Everyone else sees where this is going.  She's gotta be a touch narcissistic to think she's \"the one\" that's just so much better she's going to fix him.", "Sorry - no sympathy for the \"friend\".  Regardless of how much of a manipulator OP's ex is, what the hell kind of friend even allows the recent ex bf of her pregnant best friend to get close enough to her to manipulate her?  This \"friend\" is horrible for hooking up with OP's ex no matter how you slice it.  She just made it virtually impossible for OP to co-parent w/the father of her kids without drama.  She suuuuuucks.", "ok ok what are the chances that she used BC and got pregnant TWICE? cmon please be realistic.\n\n0,01*0,01 is... low, to use an euphemism.\n\nand finally i am NOT shaming women, so your reply is hypocrite as well. i am shaming people who do not use a condom. it takes two to fuck you know, and in theory at least one needs to have a penis to impregnate one with a vagina. shared responsibilities.", "i used to be 19. and 18. i knew when i turned 18, i had to be held to a much higher standard, and i had time to prepare.", "Yes because let's be honest, all of us who've been through similar know there's always more victims out there than they claim.\n\nTurns out my kid wasn't one of 6 but 12+", "Or, Sarah us just acting out and being used like a puppet by the creepy older ex. The words coming out of her mouths sounds like he have been saying this to get her to be with him hence she is his next victim in this situation. Also, they're all immature expect OP who was probably groomed by the creep and is now a mother to two children even though she IS still a child herself.", "Or doesn\u2019t like the smell of condoms\u2026", "\"I can't wait for our kids to be half-siblings! Don't worry, we can coparent together when he skips out on you too. Ooh, who do you think he'll pick next when he's gotten bored? Becky? Lucy? Skyler?

My friend used the depo shot and has 2 of her 4 kids from that failing. I also have 2 different friends who got pregnant after they had a tubal ligation. One had twins that were a complete surprise, the other had two kids years after her tubal ligation. She was with someone knew, her kids full grown, once they found out she could get pregnant they planned a second, TBF, tho she didn't have her tubal ligation \"reversed\" or anything. And of course, most of us know someone who got pregnant after a vasectomy, they didn't wait long enough usually but sometimes years later suddenly the blanks aren't blank that they are shooting. I was on the pill, got pregnant so after her, they switched kinds and got pregnant again. Didn't miss a dose and I wasn't on antibiotics. Know a female cop who used a condom and was on the pill, her kid is 12 now. I don't personally know anyone who got pregnant with an IUD but I have read the stories, like the one who got an ultrasound and it looked like the fetus was holding her IUD. It is way more common than people realize.", "yeah, but you don't know that she didn't use protection.\n\nI'm not saying that contraception does not work at all. I'm saying that people here are quick to go \"well, anyway, you got impregnated as a teenager by a man 10 years older than you, so clearly you guys were raw dogging it and planning this entire fiasco\".\n\nAlso, reproductive coercion is also a thing.", "Say it with me: it\u2019s a well known fact that the human brain isn\u2019t fully developed at 18.", "You do realize your very insistent responses absolutely scream either \u201cI turned 18 yesterday and think I\u2019m special and am deeply insulted by the idea that I might not be as mature as a 30 year old\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m 40 and desperate to justify sleeping with people who were children three days ago\u201d, right? Neither is a great look and you should probably just stop.", "Right....I would do this till one of them stop being involved and also OP should get child support first though", "There is 100% double standards.  I don't like them, but I also don't pretend they don't exist.\n\nA 20 year old  man getting with a woman who broke up with her ex 2 months ago and already has 1 kid by her ex and is pregnant with a 2nd would be seen as a total loser by his peers, and yeah, his family would be very dissapointed in him, and he'd be seen as a sucker.\n\nAs a man, that is clear as day to me.\n\nWhat I can't understand is how Sarah in OP's example thinks this is a good move for her.\n\nAnd yeah, we can go into why it is loser behavior, and what variables you'd have to change to make that no longer the case (everybody being 15 years older, or male version Sarah being a single dad instead of childless are 2 examples that help).\n\n***\n\nAs for your last paragraph.  It is the driver who is legally responsible not to run over a pedistrian crossing the street, but the pedestrian is the one who bears the burden of that failure.  Thus it is smart for the pedestrian to look both ways etc before crossing the street.\n\nSo double standard time again, women are the ones who \"suffer\" the most consequences for getting pregnant and bearing the child of a man they are going to split up with so while yes it is both of their fault they better excercise good judgement, because the rest of the world will be judging the quality of that decision for the next 2 decades.\n\nThat is ABSOLUTELY NOT FAIR.  But it is reality, and OP being 18 or 35 it doesn't change her dealing with the consequences.", "Because \"if he can make her happy he can make ME happy!\"", "dont get me wrong i agree it can happen, no sustem is safe 100% and thanks for sharing examples. that all said, i still maintain the right to think that getting pregnant twice at 20 is kind of peculiar and while i am just an external person and will never know how things really went, i am inclined to say that no BC method was used.", "Men like him target teen girls and they think that it is a flex. I have seen his type hanging out at the local school. Many of these young girls have NO protection from family do they buy all of that \u201cyou are mature for your age\u201d dribble that men like this spew.\n\nWe need to be working a lot harder at teaching girls to be wary of dudes like this. They really are vile and can NEVER be depended on to do what is right.", "There is a vast difference between blame and accountability. Since it is ALMOST ALWAYS the girl that will be stuck dealing with an unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease.

They would not learn from their errors in judgement and they were left impoverished and in some cases HOMELESS because they were NOT accountable for their consistent poor choices. \n\nTheir mental and physical health suffered and they had no one that was willing to help them and the people that did got TIRED of being responsible for helping someone that seemed to have no sense of self preservation. Some of the children ended up in care because of the irresponsible behavior of both their father and MOTHER!\n\nI am calling a thing and THING and a spade a SPADE!", "then why is 18 decided to be the legal age of being an adult?", "[deleted]"]}
