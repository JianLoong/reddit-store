{"id": 31885, "submission_id": "185ld71", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend to leave my house because she showed up with my ex-boyfriend?", "selftext": "I (20F) have a child and another on the way with my ex-boyfriend, Jared (30M), and we've been successfully co-parenting for the past two months. My best friend (21F), Sarah, has always been a big part of my life, and we\u2019ve been close since high school.\n\nI had a casual meet-up with my friends last month, Sarah was there too. This was Sarah's first time drinking, and she probably overdid it because she casually mentions that she's been hanging out with Jared, my ex-boyfriend and the father of my kids, more often. I was immediately taken aback, but tried not to jump to conclusions and asked her for more information. She replied saying that they had just \u201chit it off\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s a cool guy\u201d.\n\nI thought it was strange, considering our history and that we have only been broken up for two months. Not to mention, we co-parent our child and have another one on the way. Sarah said it simply wasn\u2019t her problem and she\u2019s not the \u201cone single, pregnant, and broke at 20\u201d. This comment hurt, coming from my best friend, but I was able to keep my composure and ultimately moved on after she apologized.\n\nLast Friday, Jared came over to my place to take our daughter for the weekend. He didn\u2019t mention, however, that he would be bringing Sarah too. As soon as Jared and Sarah walked through the door, I was disoriented, but I tried not to create tension in front of my daughter. I pulled them over to casually ask why they were here together. Jared and Sarah were denied being anything other than friends, and told me that Jared was Sarah\u2019s ride home and Sarah suggested coming over because she wanted to see me and my ex had to make this stop anyway.\n\nTheir behavior was beginning to bother me, and I told them that I would prefer if they did not come to my house together again in the future. Jared argued back, claiming I was being controlling and he can decide who his friends are. Sarah made a comment about me, that was something along the lines of \"Maybe if you were more fun, he wouldn't need to look elsewhere.\"\n\nThat was the last straw for me. My immediate response was to tell them to leave, quite loudly and harshly. Since they\u2019ve left, I\u2019ve been replaying the scene in my mind and just feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and sadness. The situation made me feel uncomfortable and as if my best friend didn't even care about me, but maybe I could have handled it better. It has been stressing me out, and I don\u2019t want my daughter or my baby to be affected. I have to know, Am I the asshole for the way I reacted?", "created_utc": 1701139001, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185ld71/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_to_leave_my_house/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
