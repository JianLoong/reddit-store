You are not the parent. This is terrible for the child, but unless you want to take on a lifelong task, set limits", "I am not trying to be rude when I write this, but that ain't your baby. If hid had the option not to take care of someone else's kids growing up, I would have said no so freaking fast. If they didn't want to raise a kid, they should have worn a condom. Honestly the best thing you can do is talk to an aunt, or grandparent and see if the family can work something out for the overall well being of the kid. You can help by starting the convo, but that's all you really should do.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust make it a NO, and refuse.

It his parents responsibility.", "My post seems to have mislead people\nI dont really \"look after him\" I just find myself sitting with him and realizing none of his family members are giving him the attention he needs. The kid seems pretty lonely and I think its pretty negligent to leave a 6 year old on his own. Like lil dude is saying hes scared to stay alone when I try to send him to their room. I feel shit that im trying to send him away and not saying or doing anything to maybe have his parents look with him.", "Ah ok I understand it better now. Still NTA because that kid should be getting that attention from his parents and siblings. But I will say if you can tough it out and keep being there for the little guy, if he\u2019s being neglected you might be a vital life line for him. It\u2019s not fair to dump that on you but sometimes you should do things even if they\u2019re unfair to you, I hope you can keep being his rock!"]}
