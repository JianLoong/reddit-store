You have to go online on select dates and will be placed in a queue with a random number, selected numbers can reserve a visit. \nThis is an artist I really wanted to see, I don't have many friends but all knew about how hard I have been trying to get tickets for the last 3 months.\n\n\nOne of my friends \"Anna\" got a pair of tickets, and she was kind enough to invite me so I was super hyped. Thing is, she only had two tickets, so it was just me and her.\n\n\nmy best friend \"Bianca\" invited me for drinks on the day of the exhibition. This is where I might be in the wrong, instead of telling Bianca I was going to The Exhibition, I just told her I had a museum planned with Anna without precision on what it was. I did purposely avoid telling her because she is prone to drama and I just wanted to avoid hurting her feelings by telling her I was going without her. I am quite stressed at work, and could not handle having to explain for an hour how I could not invite her cause Anna was the one with the tickets and it's nothing personal against Bianca. For reference, Bianca is extremely anxious, the type who think she did something wrong if you don't answer her text within 15min.\n\nSince I'm not smart, I forgot all about this and after the show I had great pictures that I posted on social media.\n\nBianca was super mad I had hidden from her I was going to the exhibition with Anna, and send a million messages how disappointed she was that I'm hinding things from her.\n\n From Bianca's point of view, I should not have omitted to tell her it was The Exhibition. From my point of view, she still made drama just from one picture so I was right to avoid telling her cause I didn't want to deal with her drama before going, although I should not have posted anything just to ensure no drama after the event.\n\nNormal, drama-free people, am I the one creating drama by hiding outings from friends? Anxious people, any advice on how to navigate this type of things in the future? \n\nI just feel like I can't win, i'm convinced it would have been a headache if I did tell her, Bianca would have felt left out and I would have had to spend hours convincing her it's just that Anna was lucky to get tickets, but I realize it was a mistake not to tell her as well.

Completely illogical now that I think back about it, but getting diagnosed and learning coping mechanisms did help a lot.", "is there anything else your friends did to make you feel loved without enabling the fear to grow? I really love Bianca, but sometimes I just want to do things that make me happy without having to reassure her."]}
