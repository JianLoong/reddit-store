So most likely they still wouldn't be paying full rent, unless he makes too much to qualify.\n\nAs it stands, OP is playing a dangerous game that can end up with being homeless.", "No one in this situation is sacrificing anything.

I would definitely not move unless you plan to take your name off the apartment.", "Hahahahah that\u2019s not the way it works.

You should be ashamed of yourself.", "I\u2019m gonna bet the sum of those taxes don\u2019t cover half a year of subsidized rent.

You remain in the apartment (your mother either will be removed from the lease or she will need to prove continued residency) and your brother and wife move out if not added to the lease . 3. You move to the new apartment and you remove your name from the current lease - if you are residing in a different apartment you must remove your name from the previous apartment and add it to the new one.

Not only will you be on the hook for participating in fraud, you won\u2019t be eligible for government supported housing anymore - can you afford to keep living in NYC if that happens?\n\nBasically your brother will screw you over royally. \n\nThe reason your name is on the lease and not his is versus his income is higher and greed needs to pay rent if it was his name. Which tells me your brother all have no shame and screwing your over if he benefits, even if just for a few months. \n\nYou tell you mom what he\u2019s planning before he does and you make sure you explain you and she will be blamed for fraud and you\u2019ll have nowhere to go when that happens. \n\nAnd then you tell your brother that either you all stay or he moves out, and if he tries to force you out the first thing you\u2019ll do is report that you no longer live there, that he forced you out and is intending to commit fraud. \n\nNTA.

You're in a tough spot but you need to get them out ASAP, this isn't on you your mom kind of set you uo for failure by even allowing your brother to move in under these circumstances so shame on her as well very light AH for your mom in this situation. \n\nYou're NTA unless you allow them to stay if you get caught you might possibly lose out on getting access to rent anywhere under government assistance and as you don't work and are in school you'll have to stop studies to work full time + some to afford rent in NYC or move back to your home country with mom and dad based on comments I've seen you make you have absolutely 0 income. You have ot out yourself first and if that looks selfish to your family tough shit, you didn't put yourself in this situation and since you're on the lease you're going to have to start the eviction process since I doubt they'll just up and leave willingly. Don't do it overnight but tell them how you all are breaking the law and they need to make finding new housing their #1 priority give them 45-60 days and I'd they aren't out or soon to be out by the end of that time soan start tgr eviction process", "Don\u2019t leave.

It wouldn't be tragedy if they all got the boot.", "Yes, but my experience with subsidized is that all the adults that have income is to be reported and they should be added to the unit.
