Winning the reciever, plus about 400 for parts and gunsmithing, I'd have a rare antique firearm in my collection that's worth about 1000-1500 for only 450 bucks. I was expressing excitement to my friend group about it and mentioned what my max was, and a certain friend who is no longer part of the group, signed up for the auction website and put in a max higher than mine which spiked the auction up to around $250. I only know he did this because he immediately said in the group chat \"fuck how do I back out of a bid, I'm now winning this item I only did it to fuck with you\".

First, it\u2019s a great lesson on why you don\u2019t go house hunting (or make any major life decisions really) and involve your friends-hurt feelings are bound to occur when the parties disagree.  Next, you knew very well your buddy was going to make an offer on this house, and you went and saw it anyway.  It\u2019s not the agent\u2019s fault-agents take people to homes that already have offers on the table all the time.  They of course took you to the house and advised you to place a bid on it above the asking price so they can get a bigger commission check out your purchase.  If you were a good friend, you wouldn\u2019t have agreed to see the house.  But you did, and your wife fell in love with it, and no matter what you\u2019re going to be an AH to somebody-either your friend or your wife.

A signed offer is a binding contract and you can't willy nilly get in and out of it.", "Sounds like the wife is a BIG part of the issue.", "Yes she certainly is.", "Probably was!", "Oh ok yes real estate does have to be in writing I thought you just meant verbal contracts in general. There are laws that state verbal contracts are legal unless the state requires it in writing, which real estate is one of those required in writing.", "Unfortunately it happened to me about a month ago :(", "That\u2019s not how it works. Once the offer is accepted buy the seller, the only way they can get out of it is if the buyer can\u2019t fulfill the co tract for various reasons. \n\nIt sounds like they were accepting a bunch of offers and making their decision by the end of the weekend, which is very common. This guy saw the same house his friend did, but the seller went with him because he made a better offer. He didn\u2019t wrong anyone by making an offer on a house that was on the open market.", "No, the realtor would split the difference in commission, not the whole commission. So  1k for the ex friend. Not worth the hassle and probably illegal.", "Nah you can be an asshole with that too, you just might also end up supporting a good cause while being an asshole.", "People always seem to forget that *all real estate agents work for the Seller*.  A buyer\u2019s agent is still getting paid by the Seller.", "I'd never expect them to *not* be TA lol", "I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re all white", "According to what he wrote here, she knew.", "Personally, I think that once an offers been accepted you shouldn't be able to back out. That's just shitty.", "Imagine having to pay more for your house because your friend raised the price on you? Lord.", "Exactly.  Reddit is left wing so obviously it's a logic free zone!", "There such thing as holding offers. That\u2019s not the same as accepting. As I said said there\u2019s a good amount info missing so hard to say what happened here.", "the whole point to charity auctions is to raise money for charities, if you are doing that, you are not an asshole in that endeavor. (exception if you are being an asshole while trying to raise funds outside of an event(as in before it happens)/badgering people until they give in)", "They also keep showing bc something could fall through.", "\u2026ok I may be blanking but what does that mean?\u2026\ud83d\ude05", "That seems pretty harsh. I've had good experiences with the realtors. I'm now friends with the last realtor I used in 2021.\nBut then again, I'm diligent about researching and getting references for people I engage for services.", "Realtor\u2122\ufe0f", "That depends on the law. Here, a realtor can't work for both sides of the deal. So you are either dealing with just the sellers realtor, or dealing with 2 realtors. The one you pay works for you. \n\nThey are however very chummy with eachother, so make sure you find the biggest eel to work on your side.", "Yeah, OP's actions are not the normal actions of a person - not only did he use his knowledge to overbid his friend, something I wouldn't assume normal people would do, but he also then typed it out and put it on the internet for strangers to judge him without working out that he's the AH. Who knows what this person will do in any given situation?", "It shouldn\u2019t be if there was a contract in place, but the offer could have only been accepted verbally. In that case this is fine from the sellers perspective.", "It depends. In Oregon, USA once the offer is accepted paperwork is signed and once it goes into escrow you can\u2019t just back out you have to pay a certain amount of money to the other person if you just decide to back out. But if not in escrow and no paperwork signed you can still accept other offers.", "Yes. My guess is the initial acceptance was verbal, which isn\u2019t legally binding in real estate. This happened to me as well\u2014we had a verbal acceptance, and while the agents were drawing up the paperwork another offer came in that the sellers liked better.", "Not where im from, canada. Once accepted its accepted", "Yes -- you would have to return any earnest money or deposits in full.", "Perfectly legal in the UK. It's called gazumping, and until the final contract is signed, which can take weeks and weeks, the seller can accept a higher offer. Scotland has different laws IIRC.", "I think all realtors are bad? Only thing I can think of\u2026", "Verbal acceptance is fine as long as it\u2019s written, an oral acceptance is not.", "I thought Assigned Realtor at Birth."]}
