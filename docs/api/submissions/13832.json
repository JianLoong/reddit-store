You're trying to build good habits for your child and your dad is interfering with that.

Your child, your rules. Doesn\u2019t matter if he disagrees with them.", "NTA regardless of the boundary, grandparents need to respect the boundaries put in place by the parent. Even if they don\u2019t agree, it\u2019s crucial to a healthy relationship that it\u2019s respected. You should never feel bad about creating or enforcing boundaries as long as it\u2019s done in a respectful manner.", "NTA, your kid, your rules end of. \n\nProvided you have clearly stated what your wishes are with regards to what your son cam and cannot have then they should respect your wishes. 'i gave it to you when you were young' is not a justification, that was how he chose to act with his child, your son is not his child so it has no bearing. \n\nI would concerns that when they are doing the childcare it is slightly more if a grey area, and that it is the job of a grandparent to spoil their grandkids. But that being said, they should not be going against your wishes.", "NTA.

Even with the juice.\n\nLike, juice is fine for the tiny humans, but it should be watered down. \n\nYour father needs to put himself in your shoes.

Doesn't matter what your parents did with you.  \n\nAlso, where is it written you owe it to your dad to make sure he has fun being a grandparent?  And wtf sulking at you over it.", "NTA. Time with the grandchildren is a privilege, not a right. If he can't respect what you do and do not want to go in your child's mouth, then that privilege gets revoked. Period.", "I think it depends on how often they're together. If they're together multiple times a week, it's not appropriate. If this is one or two days a month, then I think some ice cream and juice is fine. Basically, I think spoiling is fine if it's an occasional divergence from the norm, but it's bad if it's a regular habit.", "NTA. Your child, your rules.  Your dad needs to learn to respect the boundaries you set.  The more you let slide, the more you teach your dad that he will win every argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the only way to *ensure* you win is to lay down the ultimatum of removing visiting privileges and be willing to follow through.  If you're not willing to do that, it may be a losing battle.   *And that's ok, too.*", "NTA, Its your kid and he should respect what you want for your child.

I rarely drink soda or juice and have zero cavities at 60.  (Well sometimes juice with vodka.) But more importantly, the purpose of a grandparent is not to spoil the child. Having fun with them doesn\u2019t have to be dependent on breaking mom\u2019s rules. NTA", "I think you need to set grandpa down with some ground rules. He needs to respect the parents' rules first, and excessive spoiling isn't okay given frequency of visits and treats. You as the parent will be dealing with the consequences later trying to instill good eating habits only to have it undone every visit. \n\nHe can be the fun grandpa without feeding the kid sugar nonstop. If he doesn't have ideas for that, give him more suggestions. Frankly, the sugar foods are the easiest things he can think of, so just explain moderation. I get wanting a good relationship with grandpa, but if he doesn't respect parent, then you need to be hardass about it and restrict visits. If he wants a relationship, he will do better instead of insisting on doing the opposite. And if he doesn't, you'll need to start being creative with the visits and food, ie visits only at your home or maybe the park.", "NTA. I would cut him off and he would never see me or my kid. If he cannot respect simple rules now,what happens as your son gets older?", "NTA people often say grandparents are allowed to spoil their kids but says who? I think it's ok if they only see them a few times a year but when it is really problematic is when the grandparents see the kids regularly like in your case. Then you have every right to put your foot down.  \n\nHe's complaining it's no fun being a granddad because he can't give him something which literally harms him? That is selfish. It's not exactly fun for you having to be strict about sugar but you do it because you care about your kid.", "ESH, dad isn\u2019t respecting your wishes but you continue to hang out and rely on him for babysitting. It would be nice to have it both ways, but he\u2019s made it clear that you can\u2019t. Either let it go or only give him access to your kid when you\u2019re ok with junk.", "NTA\n\nA once a month sleepover is one thing; 1+/week is something else entirely. Your father is giving your son things with no nutritional value, disrespecting you, AND teaching your son that sulking/temper tantrums get you what you want. You need to nip this in the bud. It's entirely possible for kids to have a great relationship with their grandparents that doesn't depend on crap food and ignoring parents.", "I appreciate your perspective and mostly was looking for validation that I have some right to be annoyed and frustrated, and that I'm not the \"asshole.\" But like you said, my dad's intentions are good and he is obsessed with my son, and my son is absolutely obsessed with my dad. So I do not want to ruin that and would never take it away. It's too bad that it seems my dad won't change and this is just the way he will be with sweets, but if I can't make him change (which I can't) then I need to just learn to let it go I guess. Thanks.", "The thing is,if he can get away with it,he will. What happens when grandpa thinks he doesn't need a car seat,because little Jonny doesn't like it?

When we would visit, my kids would ultimately have soda (not as young as yours is now, though). I hated it. My daughter is 21, and my son is 17 now. Still no soda in my house, but they have milk with every meal and water all day long. Your parenting will pay off, and your son will see that juice is for fun times or special occasions with his grandparents. NTA\n\nMaybe buy the juice for your parents' house and put water in beforehand.", "I'm an Opa, too. But I manage to respect my kids wishes around their kids. I have drinking boxes, but they're the low sugar fruit juice sort. Straight up fruit juice can be cut with water or club soda. Me and the grand daughter share fruit, veggies, hummus, cheese, &etc. all the time. Cookies, ice cream, chips and all that are an occasional treat. Teaching the kid early how to eat properly has long term benefits. You dad can treat the kid without being a sugar monster.", "That's good perspective, thank you. The sulking was really getting to me and making me feel like I was doing something really hurtful. Thanks for the validation.", "That's good advice, thank you. I agree that it's the frequency of the visits that makes it irritate me more.. If he only saw him once a month, it wouldn't bug me as much", "Thank you.

Thanks for the perspective", "NTA, he can change, this isn't something like an internalised behavior change, it's like saying go on green light, stop on red, it's just more basic knowledge.   \nI get the grandpa thing, but he should have just listened the first time, it's not that hard, and you're not being mean.   \nMy dad helps me with my toddler all week, but he knows I'm the dad and he knows you don't pump kids full of sugar....all the time ;)"]}
