You're trying to build good habits for your child and your dad is interfering with that. Totally normal for kids to get some treats when seeing their grandparents but you have every right to ask him to run it by you and to make sure it's not excessive.", "NTA. But your dad certainly is. Your child, your rules. Doesn\u2019t matter if he disagrees with them.", "NTA regardless of the boundary, grandparents need to respect the boundaries put in place by the parent. Even if they don\u2019t agree, it\u2019s crucial to a healthy relationship that it\u2019s respected. You should never feel bad about creating or enforcing boundaries as long as it\u2019s done in a respectful manner.", "NTA, your kid, your rules end of. \n\nProvided you have clearly stated what your wishes are with regards to what your son cam and cannot have then they should respect your wishes. 'i gave it to you when you were young' is not a justification, that was how he chose to act with his child, your son is not his child so it has no bearing. \n\nI would concerns that when they are doing the childcare it is slightly more if a grey area, and that it is the job of a grandparent to spoil their grandkids. But that being said, they should not be going against your wishes.", "NTA. The choices you make now about your child's diet during a formative period of life will have huge impacts on their health, diet, and gut biome as they grow up. You're making a choice that's incredibly healthy, and your dad is repeatedly crossing that boundary.", "NTA. You need to set some FIRM boundaries. Even with the juice.\n\nLike, juice is fine for the tiny humans, but it should be watered down. \n\nYour father needs to put himself in your shoes. How would he feel if his parents continuously disrespected his authority as your parent by doing things with you he'd continuously asked them not to do?", "NTA, your kid you decide his diet.  Doesn't matter what your parents did with you.  \n\nAlso, where is it written you owe it to your dad to make sure he has fun being a grandparent?  And wtf sulking at you over it.", "NTA. Time with the grandchildren is a privilege, not a right. If he can't respect what you do and do not want to go in your child's mouth, then that privilege gets revoked. Period.", "I think it depends on how often they're together. If they're together multiple times a week, it's not appropriate. If this is one or two days a month, then I think some ice cream and juice is fine. Basically, I think spoiling is fine if it's an occasional divergence from the norm, but it's bad if it's a regular habit.", "NTA. Your child, your rules.  Your dad needs to learn to respect the boundaries you set.  The more you let slide, the more you teach your dad that he will win every argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the only way to *ensure* you win is to lay down the ultimatum of removing visiting privileges and be willing to follow through.  If you're not willing to do that, it may be a losing battle.   *And that's ok, too.*", "NTA, Its your kid and he should respect what you want for your child. Also a lot of people don't realise how damaging juice can be for the teeth. I think it's okay as a treat tho.", "NTA. My parents were like this when my son was little. Just relax, and let go. My son is now almost an adult and very, very close to his grandparents. It is disrespectful that they don't listen, but in the long run, it's not the end of the world.", "Im going with NAH - i get why you want him to drink healthier and you\u2019re not the arsehole for wanting the best for him but at the same time i think getting spoilt by grandma & grandpa is a typical sweet childhood memory and its not going to hurt him, its not coca cola and mcdonalds either. I think personally I would let it go but its up to you", "I\u2019m biased because my dad wants nothing to do with his kids or grandkids, but ESH. You\u2019re dad is annoying and needs to listen, and you need to loosen up a little. It\u2019s ice cream, not crack.", "Well, it sounds like you're just being a control freak and not letting your dad enjoy being a grandparent. Let the old man have some fun and give your son some juice and ice cream once in a while. It won't hurt him.
