To be succinct, it started out with them upset at the following:\n\n- I talked about a bit of partying around them (I apologized if this made them uncomfortable and have vowed to never discuss it again)\n\n- I didn't tell them I got a nose job until after I got it (I live on my own, paid for it myself and I'm 24 years old)\n\n- I asked them to not constantly ask about my wedding while it's on pause so my fiance and I can relax/travel for a year or so and just enjoy ourselves \n\n2 weeks ago my mom sends me a five page email letter outlining 10 years of criticisms of me, so all the way back to 14 years old. Among many things in this letter were not telling her about a crush in 9th grade, not including my parents in my grade 12 course selection, and the fact that I haven't introduced all of my friends to my parents. These really read as grasping at straws to me.\n\nShortly after I got it I replied saying I appreciate her laying that all out but I'd prefer to just talk over a video call or something. I got a reply yesterday insisting I reply with another letter. \n\nI politely said that I insist we just have a normal conversation. I didn't tell them this, but I think this is a trap to give them prep time for the next argument and pick apart every word choice of mine and lose the plot, as this is a habit of theirs. I get a response today once again demanding I reply with another letter. This time I was more firm, saying no, and that the option is to just talk like grown ups. \n\nMy dad messages me shortly after saying just how hurt my mom is that I won't write a letter back, how it's \"my way or the highway\", and how until I write one, we will not talk anymore. I replied expressing the irony in refusing any contact until I comply and I was then told to not speak to them until I write a letter. \n\nThis reads as a really desperate attempt at any control over me (the firstborn, if that adds any clarity), and I intend to just wait them out until they crack.

They want a letter for \"proof\" if you happen to slip up or say something Incorrectly Or take your words out of context by just sharing a part of your conversation. They can also infer \"Tone\" that isn't there when it's written text instead of a conversation. There's absolutely NO REASON for your mom to send you a list of grievances dating back a decade, when you were a young teenager even. It just screams controlling. Don't do it. As the great Admiral Akbar once said, \"IT'S A TRAP!\"", "WTF is wrong with your parents. You are 24 and independent. They need to accept that you won't be controlled anymore.\nOP, do not write a letter, tell them that them saying \"your way or highway\" is really ironic as they won't accept any form of communication other then a letter \nTurn their threat against them, tell them you won't talk to them unless they start behaving like rational adults and talk over phone, video call or face to face. If that's the threat they are going with, take away their ammunition.\nI'm sorry you have to go through this. It sucks when you have to plan war strategy against your parents\nOh, NTA", "Why are you even going to respond to this crazed letter?  I'm assuming you don't actually think that at the age of 24 you owe your mother an explanation or an apology for trivial things you did that offended her (irrationally) when you were 14.  And 15.  And 15 1/2.  (Of course you don't!)\n\nDon't take the bait.  Say, \"I'm not interested in discussing this further.\"  Not by letter, not by phone, not in person.\n\nYou are never, ever going to get a parent who sends a letter like this to engage rationally.  Not happening.  You don't need the aggravation.\n\nBack away from the dumpster fire.  Find yourself a therapist and process all the crap you've had to deal with through the years, to help you extricate yourself from a very, very destructive family system.  And to deal with any parts of it that you've internalized.\n\nNTA.  Don't respond.  Don't engage.  Don't dignify this litany of supposed sins with a response.", "NTA, your parents are treating you like a child and your mom is threwing a tantrum.", "NTA.

Among many things in this letter were not telling her about a crush in 9th grade, not including my parents in my grade 12 course selection, and the fact that I haven't introduced all of my friends to my parents. These really read as grasping at straws to me.\n\nBelieve it or not, I've seen some people actually say that the proper response to this level of neurotic grudge holding is to, \"reflect\" on the criticisms. Me personally? If someone has a handful of criticisms of routine behaviour it's one thing, but if they have an indexed list of every one off petty grievance they've kept in the back of their mind going back months, years, or even decades? That's not healthy behaviour, and not worthy of indulging. If anything playing into it, validating it, and even agreeing to their criticism overall just comes across to me like you'd be enabling someone with clear issues they need therapy for.\n\nYour mother did not need to know every private detail of your life from when you were in 9th grade, or be personally acquainted with all members of your social network. That just isn't an obligation.\n\nThat your mother wants some kind of letter where you...what? Apologize? Bend the knee? Or send your own issues back in her face? It all just sounds very bizarre and unhealthy. That you know she just wants something written so she can debate you on pedantic word choice is just telling.\n\n>I replied expressing the irony in refusing any contact until I comply and I was then told to not speak to them until I write a letter.\n\nYou know, I'd write a letter.\n\nA formal resignation as their child until such point as my elders can find it within themselves to communicate voice to voice like mature individuals. A reiteration that as the terms of letter based communication going forward were set by them that I expect all text or written based communication to continue in that format and that going forward I expect any further communications to be also properly cited with footnotes, use at least three primary sources, be at a minimum two pages in length, and single spaced in size 12 Old English Font. This letter should start with the words, \"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Last Name.\"\n\nI mean ok, I don't completely recommend that, but imagine... Truthfully I think others in this thread have better advice on how to handle someone like your mother, I'm just suggesting drama.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf they want a reply in the form of a snail mail letter, I'd be asking for a lawyer or a representative to send them a cease and desist letter, a temporary restraining order, small claims, and/or whatever relevant paperwork to counter that five-page email letter. Go the extra mile in \"writing a letter\" back.\n\nOr mail them a \"Sorry for your loss\" card.
