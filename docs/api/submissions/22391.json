If this is a scene you know she's not into, and you and your other friends don't want her there, then maybe not the best ideas to bring it up to her in the first place.

You can also communicate these concerns to her in a polite way before the festival.", "In my opinion YTA. If she really is as good a friend as you say you should give her the option to decline after doing her own research about the festival.

You are probably right that she won't enjoy it, but she is an adult who can make decisions for herself.

Removing her friend's right to choice and autonomy isn't really a friendly thing to do.  I get that the OP doesn't want to feel responsible for someone else when she is going to be drunk and getting crazy, but that is an adult conversation she should be having with her friend prior to the concert.  Her friend can then make the choices necessary to bring a separate vehicle/pack appropriately/have a backup plan.

But I took her to a festival because she asked to go with me...and she had a blast! because she enjoyed the music and the energy, it was new and exciting. Only 2 day campout.

I\u2019m assuming as you haven\u2019t put her reaction and you\u2019re posting here means that you really upset her by deciding for her that she wouldn\u2019t like it.

This is three days of crowds, lots of loud music, camping, and \u201cextracurriculars\u201d \u2014 a big commitment that can be expensive and mentally and physically draining. And if you have a group going together and if everyone isn\u2019t on the same page, drama eventually happens and it will bring the vibe down. \n\nI will say: There are plenty of \u201cbeginner\u201d festivals that happen year round, that are less intense and just a day or two that doesn\u2019t require camping, etc. I would politely suggest going to one of those to see if she\u2019d really like doing the festival thing. If she does like it and can handle it, then maybe this trip can happen again and she can go. There is no shortage of festivals. \n\nBtw people, not everyone has to be invited to every single friend gathering!!! I have been on the receiving end of this and I have done this myself to friends too, and it\u2019s a part of life! There aren\u2019t any hard feelings \u2014 bottom line is we are all friends and there will ALWAYS be another thing we can do together and make memories.

Did you show her videos from the festival, lineup, etc? I know that some people always want to tack along and ruin the mood because they didn't listen, so I don't blame you for not asking her. However,  I was in Jess's shoes  before: My then boyfriend planned a trip to a one-day festival  with his friends (who I also friends with) and didn't even bother to ask. It hurt really bad, but he also assumed that this wasn't something for me because I hadn't been on a festival before and didn't drink much alcohol. He also thought that the music was \"too much\" metal for me. The thing was, I did listen to a few bands who played that day all of the time. I even know the lyrics way better than him, but he didn't know because he didn't ask. I only learned about the headliners because of the shirt he got that day.\nThis was almost 10 years ago, and we are married now. Turns out between the two of us, I am the bigger metalhead, and even though I still don't drink much (so does he), I am the one who is constantly in every pit and wall of death she can find.

That's super rude and very condescending. If she insists on going go in separate vehicles so that she can leave should she decide she doesn't wanna be there anymore.

Tell her this is a major league festival, if she wants to start with a smaller local event to get her feet wet, that\u2019s fine, but 3 days without a way home is a major undertaking and a lot to ask.", "I have a hard time with big crowds and a lot of noise, but I love going to shows and music festivals. I don\u2019t do most of the drugs people around me may during those events (I\u2019ll smoke and like psychedelics), but don\u2019t mind that people are doing their thing around me and making different choices. The thing is, I know that sometimes my needs won\u2019t line up with what the others I\u2019ll attend with want to do. I may need to make different choices than my friends so that they can enjoy it the way they want to and so I can enjoy it with them while taking care of myself. If I get overwhelmed I may choose to stay out of the crowd and be somewhere there is more room around me, or pick a spot where I can sit without being in the way. It\u2019s a good safety idea to have a meeting spot in general for when separated, often the spot I pick is the meeting spot while music is going on, then there is one for if music has ended and we\u2019re still separated.\n\nIf OP doesn\u2019t trust that the friend won\u2019t make her different needs OP\u2019s responsibility, then I get not wanting to invite her. If she wants to join then she would need to understand and agree that she needs to be responsible for her own needs. A buddy system is good, there is usually one person who may want a break from the crowd as well, or doesn\u2019t mind joining in a less crowded area for a bit. There\u2019s also usually plenty of security around the less crowded bits on the edge of the crowd, so even without a buddy it can be okay unless you\u2019re too drunk or high on something where buddy safety is necessary.\n\nMaybe OP could suggest a single day festival, like dip a toe in and see how she feels in that environment and to get an idea of what she can do to help herself when overwhelmed by the crowd. She is still an adult who makes her own decisions, so in her eyes the problem may feel more like she just isn\u2019t wanted, which is kinda true, but not that true. OP just doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for someone else and wants to be free to enjoy the festival on her terms and that is okay. The situation seems like one where communication can get mixed up too easily, so I hope things work out between them.", "Agreed overall, but also sounds like OP and her friend might not be as good of friends as they think.\n\nOP makes it sound like she\u2019s making the decision in her friend\u2019s best interest, but really it just sounds like OP doesn\u2019t want to deal with her friend, which isn\u2019t what you want from a friend, and likewise, OP\u2019s friend sounds like she\u2019d be better off finding friends that have more common interests or are more accepting of her.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to go to festivals with friends to be a part of the group, but I recognize now that I could be a straphanger and a bit of downer, so probably would\u2019ve been better to not go.

I don\u2019t have the same primary friend group now as I did then, a big part of that is that I recognized that the friends I had didn\u2019t really fit with who I am, part of which is the activities I enjoy versus what they enjoy.

It still really hurts when I'm not invited.   \nI'm the least wild friend- I enjoy drinking and used to love a good fun-drunk-night, but overall I don't drink terribly much, and I don't really participate in other stuff (I'm terribly anxious about addiction issues in my family and also know my luck would be a terrible reaction) (I am pro-leafy things, but they put me to sleep, so I often decline that, even)...   \nI'm ALSO the friend who can't tell you a single song by most bands and tends to listen to the same music I did in high school because I like 'comfort' things I already know.   \nI don't care for crowds, loud people, other (non-friend) drunk or high people, mosh pits, people touching me, etc, etc. \n\nThat said- I LOVE music festivals and live music.  \nMy bestie, KNOWING we have wildly different tastes in pretty much everything, tends to be the one to invite me to them and we have a blast.

You are talking thousands of people coming to a location that really cannot accommodate all of the parking. So vehicles absolutely will be blocked in. \n\nAnd sending someone to leave by themselves isn't an easy proposition, having them take all of their bags and equipment. Send them out alone to try to find their vehicle, and hope that they can actually leave instead of being blocked in. \n\nAnd not all festivals will allow for reentry.\n\nInstead of thinking like this is an afternoon activity 15 minutes from home. Think of it as a vacation that the group has to stay together start to finish. And you know it isn't compatible with them."]}
