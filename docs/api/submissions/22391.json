I was so excited I was telling my friend (lets call her Jess) about these plans. Jess was intrigued and asked if she could come \u2013 she\u2019s never been to a music festival before. I tried telling her that this event in particular really isn\u2019t her scene and that she wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. She insisted she wants to give it a go and come along with myself and some mutual friends I\u2019m already going with. \r  \n\r  \nI really don\u2019t want Jess to come. I love her and we have been friends for 7 years now, so I know her well enough that she would HATE this festival. To start she isn\u2019t the biggest fan of crowds and doesn\u2019t drink alcohol. There will be A LOT of alcohol at this event amongst other things, if you know what I mean. \r  \n\r  \nI just know she would have an awful time and she has a bad tendency to bring everyone else\u2019s mood down when she does. We would be camping together at this festival as well, so this isn\u2019t really anywhere to go to give each other space if she is in a bad mood. Also, this festival is in the middle of nowhere and she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the festival early before the three days, me and our mutual friends would have to go with her.  I told Jess she is best sitting this event out.

Three days of her potentially being miserable and being responsible for her?  No.  Start with a smaller event, one she can leave if it turns out not to be her thing.  If it is, offer to take her next year.", "Gonna go out on a limb here but a metal festival is definitely not for everybody, please tell me I'm right.\nWhatever the case is NTA for saying that this isn't her cup of tea and she should sit it out in order to protect everybody's good times.\nHowever, maybe you can say hey, there is this less intense festival that we can do another time and introduce her to such things in a way that isn't gonna immediately put her off or should it for everybody else.", "NTA at all, and I\u2019m like your friend. She probably get a little offended for not being included but she is gonna take the mood down if she goes.", "NTA, someone has FOMO! She needs to attend a concert first than decide if she can put up with days of it.", "You in a lose lose situation\u2026 the best course of action would of been to tell her the whole truth ie I don\u2019t think you would enjoy this event and when you don\u2019t have a good time it kills everyone else\u2019s vibe.", "NAH.   \n\n\nYour friend's curiosity is normal, it is also normal that you dont want to bring her for stated reasons. Talk openly with her about it and offer to go with her on a festival you think she would enjoy more instead. In hindsight, maybe you shouldnt have mentioned it to her in the first place.", "Nah but as a introvert with social anxiety I do appreciate when people ask even if they know I\u2019ll say no.", "NTA specifically because of her history of being a misery.  That\u2019s enough to justify not wanting to take the risk of bringing her along.", "YTA - mainly because you knew you didn't want her to come along but still went to her all excited about it and then told her she couldn't go. If this is a scene you know she's not into, and you and your other friends don't want her there, then maybe not the best ideas to bring it up to her in the first place. But if you had no choice (like she asked if you had plans or something), then, when she shows interest, you respect her decision as an adult. If she doesn't like it, then you let her deal with it like an adult.\n\nAs someone who is very introverted and isn't a big fan of \"alcohol and other things\" I still appreciate my friends asking me if I want to go, instead of telling me I can't/shouldn't go. There's a big difference between the two, and it's the difference between feeling respected and appreciated as a friend and being insulted and treated like a child.", "NTA. You've got a good idea what would happen after being friends with her for years.", "Yes. In my mind if a friend wants to come you bring them along and if it goes bad you deal with it when that happens. You can also communicate these concerns to her in a polite way before the festival.", "In my opinion YTA. If she really is as good a friend as you say you should give her the option to decline after doing her own research about the festival. Plus, is this a group of friends that usually hangs out together and does fun stuff together? I\u2019m sure you would be hurt if you found out they were all making plans and intentionally leaving you out.", "YTA. You are probably right that she won't enjoy it, but she is an adult who can make decisions for herself. Giving her your reasons for thinking that this might not be a great idea is fine, unilaterally deciding that she can't try something new because you think you know what is best for her is an A H move", "Yta.  You should give her the choice and lay it out.   You are likely right she will hate it.   Music festivals are not my things I would rather just see the bands I want to see by themselves.   I Do not drink nor use other things.  I would still want to be invited and give the choice to make my decision.     Tell her why she would not like it.   If she chose to come then tell her she can drive separately so if she is having a hard time or no fun she can leave.", "YTA for acting like the reason you don't want her to come is that she would not enjoy it. That might be true as well but your personal real reason you don't want her to come is that you think she would pull you down or kill YOUR fun. Acting like you are just trying to save her from her own wrong decisions is a plain lie to yourself. \nHowever\nNTA for not wanting someone to come. I think it's fair to say that you do not want someone around you doing certain activities. Imo that's okay. Though you can't decide if she is allowed to come.", "YTA. You don't get to decide what a person can and can't handle. That's for the person in question to do. Even if they end up not having a good time, at least the experience will be of their own will and not someone making the choice for them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you should still ask her even if you think she will say no because it's nice to be invited to things. So what that she doesn't drink alcohol? Maybe she would want to go there for, ya know, *the music*? But make it clear if she wants to leave early she's on her own. And that if she 'brings everyone's mood down' you'll ask her to leave. Mild YTA", "However, it's also not a great strategy to excitedly tell a friend about an event you don't want them to go to.", "My gut says EDM. I'm betting electric forest which happened recently", "Agreed. I now know when to say no though as I'll be grumpy and bring other people down. Sounds like OPs friend hasn't worked that out yet.", "While that sentence in itself is true (at least for me), she doesn't want to say no, she wants to say yes.", "I can\u2019t agree.  Jess has a history of being a misery when she isn\u2019t having fun.  OP can consider that and decide she doesn\u2019t want to bring Jess with her on this trip.\n\nShe can\u2019t stop Jess from going, of course.  She isn\u2019t.  She can refuse to invite Jess along on the trip she\u2019s organizing.  Given the background I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an asshole decision.", "Came here to say exactly this, YTA - just because OP thinks her friend will hate it, doesn't mean she gets to make decisions for said friend.  Removing her friend's right to choice and autonomy isn't really a friendly thing to do.  I get that the OP doesn't want to feel responsible for someone else when she is going to be drunk and getting crazy, but that is an adult conversation she should be having with her friend prior to the concert.  Her friend can then make the choices necessary to bring a separate vehicle/pack appropriately/have a backup plan.  It really feels like the OP thinks this person will not be \"fun\" & is looking for excuses to leave the \"boring\" friend home.", "I kinda disagree due to the fact that if she does not like it she has no where to go and will ruin it for everyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I just know she would have an awful time and she has a bad tendency to bring everyone else\u2019s mood down when she does.
