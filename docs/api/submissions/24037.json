Which will NEVER HAPPEN.\n\nIf youre both struging this much id ask for r/resume advice and maybe r/jobs.", "NTA - you don\u2019t have a parter. You have an anchor dragging you down. They are doing nothing to change their situations. They are going to sit on their ass and wait for the help your receive to dry up then depend on you to support them. They either need to get in gear and start helping themselves or you cut your losses and move on.", "It should be a hard deadline too, OP needs to renew with a partner who can pull their own weight, no matter  what their actual weight is.", "Agreed. This person is only holding you back.", "Honestly, also to the partner if OP continues to enable them.", "My red flag senses started tingling when she said they only wanted a supervisory position\"because they don't like being told what to do\".", "#2 is so true.

Regardless of what one might think of their appearance, they did what had to be done to get a job.", "You don't know that the partner is a woman.", "why did you capitalize and quote 'they'?", "Sounds like this person has a pride problem and doesn't realize they are up s*** creek. I mean they are being choosy about what jobs they want, choosy about what meals they want.. beggars can't be choosers.

Please leave this person. You can do better.", "Noooooo. Of course they're not", "Because using they like this is attention seeking stupidity. Better?", "[deleted]", "care to explain why using proper grammar is \"attention seeking stupidity\"? you still sound uneducated.", "i don't think you have the right to preach about the english language, since you clearly don't know what you're talking about."]}
