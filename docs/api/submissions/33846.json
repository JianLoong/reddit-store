You've had years since you have grown up to go to him and tell him how you felt about how he treated you when you were depressed. So then you wait until his wife dies and use that as an opportunity to take revenge instead.

These people suck. Your dad is definitely an asshole for making you go through so many life changes and not providing you any kind of emotional support. That's a terrible dad.\n\nIt does not entitle you to mock his grief, though. I know you're trying to teach him a lesson and make him see what it was like to be you. It's not efficient because he truly thinks your feelings are lesser, so he can't make on his own the parallel between how he treated you all these years and how you're treating him now and then learn from it. \n\nIt would have been so much better to just tell him \"You weren't there for me when I was grieving my old life and you didn't offer me transition in this new life you imposed on me, so you could play house with your new family. I won't be there for you either in your time of need. You can handle your grief without support just like I did....as a child, mind you.\" That way, instead of just hurting him for the sake of hurting him (from his point of view), you're showing him what he couldn't see all these years.", "This is such a bad fake post it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nYou\u2019re 28 yet the immaturity in your typing screams that you\u2019re actually still 11.

But they were/are both suffering with exactly the same shit I went through - pain, dependence, isolation - and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It was bad.\n\nYour father has lost one of the most important people in his life. He is not in the mind space to draw parallels between how he is suffering now and how you suffered. All he knows is he's lost another person in his life because you're not supporting him but point scoring. If he matters at all to you, then wait a bit for the big lessons. If he doesn't matter, then walk away.", "YTA. And a pretty big one. Thats a new level of cold man. I\u2019ve had plenty of people invalidate my mental illness and I never not once used that as an excuse to mock their grief about someone dying, let alone their spouse.

You should be ashamed of yourself.", "[removed]", "Info: \n\nDid you think you were being mean but he deserved it because he was so mean to you?\n\nOr did you think that was an appropriate way to behave because that's the only behavior that was ever modeled for you?", "YTA.

But I'm pretty sure you get a \" well this is different\"", "YTA. First the good news; you give a list of reasons for why you became depressed; that list of grievances makes your depression non-clinical, meaning that if you get therapy to address them you can literally be cured of it. The bad news is that you fell into the trap a lot of children of divorce do, where they blame, demonise, and attack the custodial parent, who is the 'safe' parent as they never left them. This is clearly shown in that you simultaneously claim he both ignored your emotional pain and fretted when you refused to talk about it; that certainly sounds like the kind of delusion that non-clinical depression can cause, since it can easily convince you of malice where there is none, but it's not logically possible for your emotional needs to have simultaneously been an irrelevance and a source of constant worry for him. You were needlessly cruel to him, AND your stepbrother, because you've not put the work in to heal from a harm inflicted on you by your *mother*.", "ESH. I'm sorry you have two parents that care so little about you. That said you weren't any better. What was your stepmom's relationship with you like?", "YTA Your father just lost his wife and you think \"now is the time for revenge\". Move out. Stop treating the one parent that didn't abandon you like crap.

I understand why you said it, and its to a certain extent justified, but you're still kicking a man when he's down.

YTA. Learn how to communicate.", "Slight YTA I don\u2019t feel sorry for your dad either if it\u2019s any consolation. Was it harsh? Yep. Rude? Mmhmmm, but when someone has made you feel like shit for years without a care about your needs\u2026 It is justified.

Yes, ESH, but it's whole new level when someone has died and then you hit below the belt.", "I was so ready to say YTA, but if he dismissed you your whole childhood and didn\u2019t recognize that being abandoned and unwanted by your MOTHER is horrible, almost worse than them dying, then he deserves the same treatment back. Im sorry your family dismissed you like that, sounds like u went through a lot as a little girl.", "ESH \nYour dad reaping what he sowed", "No, you're not an asshole, but I'd probably get banned for using the actual words, so I'll settle for YTA.", "Yea YTA.", "[removed]", "NTA, match energies is never bad for me unless you\u2019re actually murdering them.

I'm going with NTA (with a slight lean toward e-s-h).\n\nAlso given stepbrother's relatively chill reaction to what OP said, I'm kinda wondering if stepmom and OP's dad weren't exactly great to him, either. That, or else they've been so blatantly awful to OP that even he kinda gets it. \"You're being too harsh\" is a really underwhelming reaction to what OP said.\n\nI do recommend therapy, though. Also, both your parents are awful and I'm so sorry.", "Considering he ruined your childhood and left you with scars from which you will never recover - no really. childhood depression is something you never recover from - frankly I understand why you said this.

You were grieving the loss of your mother\u2014 might as well have been dead. The loss of your language. The loss of your home.\n\nIt\u2019s death in a different way. Abandoned by your father still there.\n\nESH, still, since you should have been compassionate.

No, you don't have the degree to document it and get insurance to cover medication and stuff like that, but you can know you're depressed without someone with a degree telling you that you are depressed. I can every spring start sneezing and coughing and have itchy eyes, and I can tell I have seasonal allergies without a doctor having to run the tests to determine what exactly I'm allergic to, and unless over-the-counter medication doesn't work for me, I don't need to see a doctor to treat my allergies. If there's a stomach bug going around and I'm hugging the toilet bowl, I can be pretty sure I caught it rather than have some sort of other illness. And if I have sensory issues, difficulty reading other people's expressions, take things literally, stim, etc, I can look up my symptoms and see that I may be on the autism spectrum, even if I'm not a doctor.

If symptoms persist after basic treatments, or if they hinder our ability to go about our daily lives, we can then talk to a doctor to see if there's something more going on and if more treatment is available.

She parroted her fathers words back to him.", "28 years of that and all they did was tell them they're being dramatic? I'm baffled it's not complete no contact. ESH", "Wow, it\u2019s almost as if this happened in her childhood", "That\u2019s the best approach any time someone says that you have hurt them. Accept that you hurt them, whether you remember doing it or not and whether you meant to do it or not. Your memory and your intentions don\u2019t really matter; what matters is that someone who you care about is hurting. \n\nIf you really didn\u2019t intend to hurt them, it\u2019s okay to explain what you were thinking at the time. But do it after you have made your apology. It\u2019s a separate thing to do.", "I\u2019m just curious as to what the commenters harping on her age have to say about the father behaving that way in the first place. At what point is he supposed to be mature enough to take accountability for emotionally neglecting his daughter? Or is he not required to become emotionally mature no matter the age? I\u2019m just curious as to what they think the formula they are using for healing that 28\u2013 an age that in reality is still quite young all things considered\u2014 means being more mature than the people who raised you.\n\nAgain, doesn\u2019t mean Op is completely acceptable in her actions, it\u2019s just interesting to see. She wasn\u2019t even particularly hateful\u2014 just apathetic and literally using the words he would use for her.\n\nSomeone mentioned how calling someone dramatic for sharing their thoughts and then guilting them for not sharing their feelings is gaslighting, and I tend to agree.\n\nIt makes you feel completely unsafe in your emotions to be shamed for them at the same time as you are forced to share them.\n\nThere are many ways this situation could have been handled differently for sure, but I\u2019m noticing a lot of double standards and unfair blame, personally.", "You keep comparing in an attempt to almost excuse her actions.\n\nYou can admit she was wrong, without having to say her father was in the wrong for something that happened in the past", "You keep comparing in an attempt to almost excuse her actions.\n\nYou can admit she was wrong, without having to say her father was in the wrong for something that happened in the past", "I can. I\u2019m choosing not to because to me, it is relevant. I\u2019d say the same of you: you can admit she\u2019s wrong without ignoring her father\u2019s actions.\n\nI think she was wrong. I just also think he was wrong, and frankly, I think he was more wrong and I personally feel addressing that is  important.", "Cruelty begets cruelty apparently. ESH", "YTA I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you as a child but you are now 28. Your step mom died a week ago and your comment was made to deliberately hurt your father. \n\nYou have had ample time as an adult to go to therapy and talk to your Dad about your issues. Your Dad may not have been the best but I\u2019m guessing he has tried to support you in the best way he can over the years. \n\nGrow up and be a better human. If you want empathy from others  learn to also have empathy for other people as well.", "YTA. I am sorry you had a tough childhood but you are a grown adult woman now. Go to therapy and never talk to your dad again  if you don\u2019t want to, but saying this to a man who has just lost his wife in a sudden and traumatic way is just cruel. The fact that you saw this as an opportunity to rub your dad\u2019s nose in it says some concerning things about you.", "There\u2019s a lot to unravel here with your growing up but to say to ANYONE that they are being dramatic after losing a loved one is being a huge AH and an extremely unkind thing. Get yourself some help to work through what you need to.", "Sorry Op, you admitted to the great crime of being female. With current state of the sub at most you'll get some e-s-h, a butload of holier-than-thou thou y-t-a, and one or two NTAs .\nYou are not the asshole but you won't get a fair or rational opinion here.", "YTA for saying that but he has it coming.", "I think all of the Y T A comments are hilarious solely because I saw a post *exactly* like this here maybe a month ago where everyone voted NTA.", "Yes, YTA", "Good God yes, YTA. A huge asshole. You moving to a new place and your other parent skipping out is in no way on the same level as his wife dying. You're a foul, foul person and a bona fide asshole.", "YTA.  Your assholery beggars belief.  You said something unbelievably cruel as a got'cha, and I sure hope it felt good because karma is going to bite you.  You are, theoretically, at least, an adult.  Yet I thought a real child had slipped through and was writing this post.  You had a terrible childhood, and I am so sorry.  But you are no longer a child with no control over your life.  Now go do something about it.  Get into therapy.  Move out of your dad's place.  Make a change.\n\nAnd for heaven's sake, learn some punctuation.", "LMAO at all the Y T A comments here.\n\n\"How dare you not care about the feelings of a man who neglected you and didn't care about your feelings either\"\n\nTo use the favorite phrase of Redditors:\n\nWell, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of my own actions. \n\nExcept, for some reason, this situation is different, somehow.\n\nNTA OP. Please don't listen to all these hypocrites calling you AH even though they defended ten times worse things being said to bad people.", "Listen, I get it. You are hurt and wanted to get him back, but you are still the AH. There was a sudden recent death. It doesn\u2019t make what he did to you right. I had a parent who could never see their awful ways and was such a hypocrite in wanting help and comfort from me while routinely treating me harshly. That person is gone now. I still have that hole and that anger, like you will when your dad is gone. But being a cold hearted jerk like them is still being a coldhearted jerks. Look into counseling-maybe start by looking for someone from your native culture.", "YTA.  Taunting someone who's just lost their spouse is beyond the pale.", "YTA. None of the background you listed matters in this context. Grow up.", "It was an AH thing to say.  But sounds well earned.  I would go with Y T A.  Had he not dismissed depression.  With the exact same phrasing.  A depression he helped foster.   \n    \nI wish there was a Justified AH tag.  But since there is not.  NTA.", "Wait... A WEEK AGO!? \n\nYour Stepmom died a WEEK AGO?

The Father is an AH here, and did not support his child growing up.", "Most parents were not hip and savvy to mental health stuff a decade ago?? OP\u2019s dad was the parent who stayed. The parent who took care of them. Just because they were distant or not perfect does not give OP, who is a current ADULT, the right to act like a monster.", "I'm astonished at all the ESH.  This is monstrous.", "Post clearly says that they moved because she already spoke English so they moved to the States.", "Question, did you read how she was raised? She was raised by HIM to believe that. So, I think you are a bit off base here.", "THIS... easy and obvious ESH...", "The cycle only continues if she passes it onto the next generation.

It is her responsibility to break the cycle, but she wasn\u2019t the one who introduced herself to that cycle.\n\nMy heart just hurts for her. It is very difficult to unlearn what you\u2019ve learned in childhood, and people expecting her to just be okay with zero support from her family are living in their own experiences a little too much and could use some understanding themselves.", "Lol, I havent heard that expression for ages. I have a mental picture of Op's dad being a gander.", "1) I reject that parents were not hip and savvy to mental health stuff a decade ago as someone who was put in therapy as a child in the 90s because one of my parents thought I had an ED. \n2) OP\u2019s father wasn\u2019t distant, he moved her to a new country and when she became depressed due to struggling with a new language and having no friends called her dramatic. That is actively harmful. \n3) If you think OP acted like a monster because she treated her father the way he treated her, why don\u2019t you think OP\u2019s father is a monster?", "Yes, that\u2019s what I said ESH. She knows what she did sucks but her dad isn\u2019t someone that deserves or even earned non-AH behavior from her, at least not until he takes responsibility for how her treated her.
