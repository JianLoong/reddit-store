We talked about how she would have to wear bras everyday, at the very least for gym or karate(hated them, now loves them). I started talking to her at the beginning of 4th grade about periods in the most minor way(if you ever see blood from there, don't freak out and think you're hurt, it's a period and all girls get them at different times, let me know immediately if that happens). In the fall of 4th grade the girls all got the \"period class) at school. She turned 10 in December and less than a month later got her period. A week before that I randomly took her to pick out a \"period bag\" that she can keep in her backpack with pads and a change of underwear(she's been such a champ, it's been 6 months). I cannot IMAGINE her not being prepared for this. Btw kotex carries teen pads, we get those if you want to get them for your niece.

You explained that it's normal, what to do to feel better and did everything you could to support her. It sounds like her mother is a bit...off.  If so, she'll need all the loving and supportive adults she has in her corner. \nIt makes me wonder what her game plan was (or if she was just ignoring the fact that this would happen eventually) and what else she hasn't explained or lied about.

She's going to need you!", "Nta. Can you get a pre-paid MasterCard or visa that you can load money to via an app so your niece can go and buy her own products because it seems unlikely her mum will buy them when she goes home.", "NTA. Not even close, your niece's mother (is she technically SIL still, I can't figure it out but fine to refer to her as that imo) is being a grade A moron.\n\nCorrupting her, does she realise what happens to kids when crazy shit happens to them and you refuse to tell them what it is, tell them it's normal and help them through it? They start thinking they are cursed, or being punished, or evil, or dying and making a child think that because you are too pathetic to explain these things to your kids is nothing short of abuse.\n\nSee if you can find some youtube video on the results or dangers of refusing to explain your kids period to them and send it to this woman and hope she can look beyond her own ignorance and realise how wrong she is. \n\nIt might be a little manipulative but explaining to the niece how this happens to every woman and that it's normal, never, ever to be ashamed of but some people are taught to think it's bad or think these things should be ultra private and will try to shame you for talking about or having periods at all and that those people are just wrong. \n\nHow much unintentional or intentional damage parents will do to their kids for the dumbest reasons still blows my fucking mind.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is wrong with her mom? Anyone who has a period is old enough to be told that they're not bleeding to death and how to manage their pain/hygiene. \n\nIs there anything else that is abusive, neglectful or concerning about her mother/home life? This is a big red flag.\n\nMy mom's guardians when she was a kid (she was raised by family in extreme poverty) were very religious and had a similar mindset regarding periods. For months no one explained it to her and she thought she was dying until someone at school figured out what was happening, told her and gave her the VITAL MEDICAL information you just gave your niece. \n\nThis is and always has been a lasting significant trauma for her. \n\nYour niece is lucky to have you and your husband.", "NTA.\n\nUh, no.  Apparently she wasn't too young for that talk, because it's happening.  You have to explain to girls what's going to happen to them around their 10th birthday, because some start early.  \n\nMy niece's Mom and maternal Grandma didn't give her the talk, so my brother had to tell her that at some point she was going to start bleeding and it didn't mean anything was wrong with her.  I don't understand these Moms who let their poor daughters be scared out of their minds that something is seriously wrong with them.", "NTA\n\nit's not an adult subject if it's happening to a child, sheesh", "Unfortunately some very religious people think that womanhood is inherently sinful and periods are the transition from innocent girl to temptrous harlot.  Men aren't supposed to debase themselves by having any knowledge about periods and women are supposed to whisper the shameful secrets to their daughters and hope that no one finds out for as long as possible that the daughters are now unclean.\n\nOP was expected to contact the mother immediately and let the mom shame her daughter for a natural biological process.  Instead, OP let her niece know that everything was okay and treated it matter-of-factly, removing at least a bit of the stigma.", "Op is definitely NTA. Not old enough? Poor girl needed preparing for it happening. I don't have girls, but my boys know I have periods and that all women do. Along with an age appropriate explanation of why. These subjects should not be taboo. Poor girl, good job, she was with 2 adults that had the sense to explain it to her.", "This poor girl\u2019s mother is being absolutely unreasonable...", " She did not sound ashamed at all.", "Dirty pillows", "Good point about keeping in touch. You can bet that as soon as she gets home it\u2019ll be viewed as shameful and dirty instead of a natural part of growing up and being female. It would be good to see if she has any other supportive adults in her life where she lives or school teachers who she can turn to.", "My grandma experienced something similar. Her mom was a nurse but refused to tell her what was going on (she was also ten.) She went to her aunt who everyone called the crazy aunt and asked her for help. That aunt did what my great grandma should have.", "... the intervention of the holy spirit, ofc!", "You're arguing semantics. Take some context clues and try to figure out what the person speaking means, instead of arguing against something no one is talking about.\n\n\"Medical issue\" in this context does not mean \"problem\". It means exactly what you said \"biological, or natural/physical thing.\"\n\nYour next comnent, in any context, is just plain wrong because it contradicts itself.\n\n>Not everything concerning women's health needs to be medicalized\n\nWhat do you think medicine is, if not that which concerns health?", "It's a medical issue literally because of its biological, physical nature. It involves a woman's organs. You can have a disorder or get anemia which is also a medical issue stemming from this one. Just like the pads are still a biohazard because they have body fluids on them, this is a medical issue. It's not a medical *emergency.* I think you are being oversensitive to using medical terminology.", "For some people it definitely is a medical situation in which there's no solution other than medicine and/or an enormous lifestyle change. Just because it may be medical doesn't mean it's gross or should be avoided.", "Pregnancies and periods are not the same. And it goes without saying that periods can and should become a medical matter if suffering is involved. I do not wish to downplay that at all, so no need to get personal there. It's simply not a medical issue if there is no medical issue.", "Lol, a period that doesn\u2019t involve suffering of some sort. \ud83d\ude02 If you are a woman you are blessed. Not wrong about the pregnancy vs period. I think it was just used as a this is shit women deal with. Periods do have to be monitored like pregnancies in that if something is off, it needs to be checked. Too long too frequent too painful too much blood etc etc."]}
