We have three girls of our own (2, 5, & 7). We've been married for almost 9 years.\n\nMy husband's older brother passed away 10 years ago. He was supposed to be the best man at our wedding. They were very close and the loss forever changed my husband. His brother had a daughter who is now 10. She never got to know her dad, so my husband (her godfather) did his absolute best to try and keep his memory alive and step up to be whatever she needed.\n\nOur niece lives with her mom across the country. They moved away around three years ago, so all of our contact has been through FaceTime. We arranged for a summer visit so our niece could see her father's side of the family and meet her youngest cousin. Her mom was hesitant about it. She's very high-strung and protective of her daughter. She's also very religious. We are as well, but to a lesser extent. \n\nMy niece got her first period a few days ago. I was out running errands so my husband was the only one home. She came to him crying. She said something along the lines of \"I know it's gross, but I'm bleeding.\" She'd never heard of a period and thought she would have to go to the ER. He told her it was completely normal and showed her where I kept my hygiene products, though he was clueless about how to explain it to her. He tried calling me but I was on my way home so I didn't answer his call.\n\nI came home a few minutes after and tried to explain how to use the hygiene products I had available. I told her that we'd go in the morning for her to pick out some stuff together so she'd feel more comfortable. It was really shocking to me that she had no idea what was happening to her or even a slight idea that it was normal, but I understand that some girls start earlier than expected or before their parents can give them the puberty talk. \n\nI called her mom after the initial conversation to ask how she wanted me to approach things or if she'd feel more comfortable talking to her daughter herself. She said that she was uncomfortable with the fact my husband had talked to her daughter about her period and that I hadn't called her the minute I'd found out. She said not to talk to my niece about it because she wasn't 'old enough' and that I'd stepped out of line. When I told her that someone needed to explain it to her, she hung up on me and didn't return any of my texts. \n\nThe next morning I took my niece to buy whatever she wanted (pads, some clothes, chocolate). We also sat down after to talk about what a period is and what to expect going forward. Topics like pain management and the importance of staying clean during that time of month were also discussed. I kept everything age appropriate and as factual as possible. We watched some videos for girls in her situation as well in case there was anything I missed. \n\nI sent her a text this morning to let her know that our niece needed her mom during a time like this and got a rant about how I was corrupting her with adult subjects.

What did she expect you to do lie and say it was a medical issue? I am lost on the mom's entire attitude about this.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL sounds absolutely unhinged, not gonna lie. If my step kid's mom had reacted like this when she got her first period while visiting us, I would have called CPS.", "I like how this mom thinks telling her daughter about menstruation is just too much for her to handle but suddenly unexpectedly bleeding from your vagina and having NO idea what\u2019s happening definitely won\u2019t scar her for life.", "You acted wonderfully, and so did your husband. Somebody had to explain to this girl what is happeingn with her body and her mother refuses. Good that she could confide in the two of you. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nWhat does mom think she's going to do, pray her daughter's period away?\n\nIf it has started, she needs to understand the basics.  And if her mom can't handle that, she's fortunate to have you there to help out.", "NTA, your sil sounds like an idiot. Once my daughter started developing in ways, we talked about hair. We talked about how she would have to wear bras everyday, at the very least for gym or karate(hated them, now loves them). I started talking to her at the beginning of 4th grade about periods in the most minor way(if you ever see blood from there, don't freak out and think you're hurt, it's a period and all girls get them at different times, let me know immediately if that happens). In the fall of 4th grade the girls all got the \"period class) at school. She turned 10 in December and less than a month later got her period. A week before that I randomly took her to pick out a \"period bag\" that she can keep in her backpack with pads and a change of underwear(she's been such a champ, it's been 6 months). I cannot IMAGINE her not being prepared for this. Btw kotex carries teen pads, we get those if you want to get them for your niece. She also has panty liners for when we think it's coming and when it's almost over. YOU ARE AN AMAZING AUNT. There's nothing sexual or adult about periods. It's not like you told her about doggy style and anal beads. She needs to lighten tf up", "NTA. If she's started her period,she's old enough to know what it is. I got the period talk at 10 but didnt start till years later. Periods are hardly an \"adult topic\" when 10 yr olds are getting them and need to know whats happening. You did the right thing,her mother hadnt explained it and helped her.", "Her mother is ridiculous.  If she is old enough to start her periods, she is old enough to know about it.", "NTA. \nHow else could you have handled it? Just let her bleed and be in pain while refusing to tell her why? I was freaked out the first time I got my period and I'd had several conversations about it beforehand. I can't imagine how terrifying it was for her. \nYou and your husband handled it perfectly. You explained that it's normal, what to do to feel better and did everything you could to support her. It sounds like her mother is a bit...off.  If so, she'll need all the loving and supportive adults she has in her corner. \nIt makes me wonder what her game plan was (or if she was just ignoring the fact that this would happen eventually) and what else she hasn't explained or lied about. Making sure your niece is informed and supported is more important than your SIL having a shit-fit.", "NTA and this was literally a Carrie White moment. She was bleeding and thought she was sick. Shame on her mother for leaving her so unprepared.", "NTA. Not old enough? She's literally menstruating! She is old enough and she has the *right* to know what is happening in her own body. Just because her mother doesn't want it happening doesn't mean *it isn't already happening*.\n\nIs there someone you can talk to about her mom? One of her relatives or friends? Because she's clearly not going to listen to you and your husband anymore and it sounds like she's not coping with change and dealing with control issues.", "Did she expect to just let her turn into Carrie?!", "NTA. I do understand parents wanting to be the people having these conversations but her mom had all the chances to do it, and she didn\u2019t. People of all genders deserve to know how their bodies work. Lots of things a normal, healthy body does can be scary if you don\u2019t understand them. My first cycle was hard enough, and my mom had talked to me all about it, I had an older sister, and I was totally prepared with all the necessary products.  \nYou did what you had to do to make a child feel supported and safe. That will never be asshole behavior.", "NTA - Nieces mom is def TA\n\nAlso this may be a little bit old and I\u2019m not sure if American Girl Doll still makes the book, but I vividly remember having a book about personal hygiene and periods for young girls. It was called the Care and Keeping for You if I\u2019m not mistaken. Highly suggest having it around in the house if you have girls and are afraid that they will be uncomfortable or scared during this time.", "NTA- I've been talking to my girls about periods as soon as it was getting close that age. My oldest started at 11 and came to me about it as soon as it started. You handled it like any mature adult would as well as your husband. Her mom on the other hand is sending out some \"Carrie\" vibes. I would definitely make sure that your niece knows that you are there for her and make sure she has your number written down and not just in a phone so she can contact you if she needs you guys.", "NTA.\n\nBoth of you were such an angel\u2019s for her !", "Its great to see how supportive you and your husband are towards your niece during this important time in her life.", "NTA. What is SIL going to do when niece gets pregnant because she wasn\u2019t taught biology? Just no words on how ignorant SIL is. This isn\u2019t about religion.", "NTA, I think that all younger people should know about punctuation.

That conversation should have happened years ago. We started talking about it with my kids when they were around 7-8 so it wasn\u2019t a new topic by the time my kid started at 10. Your SIL is deranged thinking that periods are an adult topic. Considering just about everyone that menstruates starts menstruating as a child, it\u2019s always been a child-appropriate topic.", "Is your nieces mom the same mom from Carry?", "Obviously NTA but your family deserves for your coparent to also be educated about periods\u2014your spouse as an adult and parent of future menstruators should learn enough about it that they aren\u2019t \u201cclueless about how to explain\u201d going forward. Think of this as a wake up call. I hope your spouse is proactive enough to look it up and learn, but if they aren\u2019t, maybe you can help to educate them too. It\u2019s a terrible disservice we do our young to only teach them about their own bodies, increasing the feeling that this is a taboo subject, when this is relevant info to all of humanity. If this all just sounds ideological, what if something happens to you and your spouse is the one who has to guide your 3 children through this milestone when they get there?

When they were very little they used to get my \"nappies\" out for me when I asked (their term).\n\nYour sil seems to be very \"Carrie - esque\" and equates menstruation with sex (like Carrie's mom). \n\nI'm so glad your neice has you there because I imagine her education over this would have been abysmal with her parent.

If your husband's parents are still alive, you might want to discuss with them as well.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Too bad her mom cannot say the same. That girl is being neglected at home. It is times like this that teaching sex ed in school was geared for.
