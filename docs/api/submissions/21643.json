We talked about how she would have to wear bras everyday, at the very least for gym or karate(hated them, now loves them). I started talking to her at the beginning of 4th grade about periods in the most minor way(if you ever see blood from there, don't freak out and think you're hurt, it's a period and all girls get them at different times, let me know immediately if that happens). In the fall of 4th grade the girls all got the \"period class) at school. She turned 10 in December and less than a month later got her period. A week before that I randomly took her to pick out a \"period bag\" that she can keep in her backpack with pads and a change of underwear(she's been such a champ, it's been 6 months). I cannot IMAGINE her not being prepared for this. Btw kotex carries teen pads, we get those if you want to get them for your niece.

You explained that it's normal, what to do to feel better and did everything you could to support her. It sounds like her mother is a bit...off.  If so, she'll need all the loving and supportive adults she has in her corner. \nIt makes me wonder what her game plan was (or if she was just ignoring the fact that this would happen eventually) and what else she hasn't explained or lied about.

Just because her mother doesn't want it happening doesn't mean *it isn't already happening*.\n\nIs there someone you can talk to about her mom? One of her relatives or friends?

I do understand parents wanting to be the people having these conversations but her mom had all the chances to do it, and she didn\u2019t. People of all genders deserve to know how their bodies work.

However, I then found out that my best friend had gotten hers at 10 and wasn't allowed to tell me about it. Which shocked me that she hadn't told me. We knew all about sex at that age (10), but her mom thoughts periods were verboten. I guess she didn't know we all knew about sex!

In the US, anything \"medical\" is equated with intervention rather than prevention or holistic care. A HUGE part of medical care is actually preventing illness. This is why we have health departments, regulations for clean water, sewage treatment, and laws for food handling. These are all scientifically based and designed to prevent disease. Is discussing menarche (the onset of menses) and how to keep keep clean and treat cramps a prevention? Yes. I would also add that a talk about sexual intercourse needs to follow soon. This is a medical prevention. I have delivered babies to VERY young girls who did not get the education they needed to understand what sexual abuse even was or how pregnancies occurred. Education is medical prevention. Sure, menarche is a normal process, but having an educated discussion about your body is also a form of medical prevention.", "That bothers me so much. The girl thought she needed to go to the hospital! I'm also really bothered by her starting with \"I know it's gross\".

Your kid is going to get older and they're gonna start growing hair in strange places and feeling weird feelings about people they like and half of kids are eventually gonna end up bleeding on a regular basis.  None of what I said is inherently sexual or offensive and all of what I said is inevitable for human beings.  You can teach kids the basics in an age appropriate way - it's not difficult.  Keeping them ignorant is denial at best and abusive at worst.  That poor kid - if all you know is \"bleeding is bad and it means your body got hurt or is sick\", bleeding from a place you've never bled from before would be profoundly terrifying!  And now that she's technically able to get pregnant, not telling her that is just criminal.  You don't have to get explicit about it.  Just simple facts.

This is because fat produces estrogen, so having excess fat can trigger the onset of puberty at an earlier age.  I also heard that this is the reason why obesity and hitting puberty early are both risk factors for breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\nI started very early (two months before turning ten), and I was the on the chubbier side compared to most of the other kids in my grade.  The only few girls who started early than me were all noticeably larger than me.  My mother started at a fairly normal age (13).  The only other woman who started as early as me in my family was one of my aunts, and like me, she was a chubby kid (and has remained fairly plump since then).", "Yeah the majority of faith run schools are wildly uneducated, especially in matters of health science.

With Catholic schools in more...blue regions, kids will get sex ed that's somewhat science based, like they'll get a very comprehensive overview of how the reproductive system works and what periods are and shit.  They might vaguely allude to birth control but mostly just use Catholic Guilt^TM to discourage kids from thinking about sex.  There's a lot less of the gross \"purity\" aspect that a lot of Evangelical (Protestant) sects have.  It's more like \"God only wants you to do these things BECAUSE GOD SAID SO\" and not \"God only wants you to do these things because otherwise you lose all your worth as a human being\".  Catholics might shame you about sex but they don't necessarily believe in keeping kids ignorant. 90% of Catholics have used contraception, so it's kind of a \"yeah you should feel guilty but also it's still probably gonna happen so don't be stupid\".\n\nMy mom was hard core Catholic and still gave me a very rigorous overview of those things.  She actually made me use tampons starting from my very first period because they're \"easier\" and \"you need to get used to them\".  She didn't believe in the whole \"if you put anything inside your vagina you are dirty\" nonsense when it came to medical issues.\n\nI went to a Quaker school, they're super liberal so middle school sex ed included a full overview of scientific and social topics, including novelty condoms and homosexuality - pretty damn progressive for a religiously founded school in the mid 90s."]}
