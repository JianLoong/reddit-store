My dad hated cats and went on about his allergies, but we were too little to understand (maybe 6 and 4 at the time). My sister found the mangiest stray cat and we brought it home. My mom didn't have it in her heart to say no to this poor cat, so she stashed it in the basement. Overnight, the cat came upstairs, settled on my father's chest, and fell sound asleep.

For cats, rabbits, and horses, I get all those fun reactions, and my breathing gets labored and, if the exposure lasts too long, I have an asthma attack.  \n\nWe have a dog.  Why?  Because our daughter wanted and deserves a four-legged family member, and my reaction to dogs is not as severe as cats or rabbits.
