Viv hasn't seen her mom since she was 6.\n\nHayden and I have always been close. I think part of our closeness is related to the stuff we went through with dad and the shit we got from people. What he did followed us around and it was adults who would bring it up mostly. Eventually mom had to pick up and move our lives so we could start fresh somewhere we wouldn't have that following us. That move coincided with her moving in with Jim. They had a long distance relationship and decided they would throw us all together and assume it would blend perfectly. Hayden and I had not met our Jim or Viv before moving in with them. Our mom and Jim thought we'd all become insta siblings.\n\nHayden and I don't have any issues with Viv but I don't consider her a sister like I do Hayden. We get along fine but I wouldn't go to the ends of the earth for her like I would for Hayden and I don't know her as well. I can always see when Hayden's going through something and I know her favorite things that can cheer her up. It's not like that with Viv.\n\nIn April I noticed something was going on with Hayden and asked her about it. Her best friends parents had done some digging after something was said and found out about our dad and decided their daughter could no longer have anything to do with Hayden. She was devastated. I decided to cheer her up and we went out for some bro-sis time. That same day Viv was telling Jim that she had been bullied for months and that it had escalated because some of the kids approached her at the store that day. When Hayden and I got home later mom said we needed to talk. She and Jim told us what had happened and asked had we noticed anything. We said no. We had no idea. Jim asked where we'd been anyway and I mentioned that Hayden had been upset and going through stuff and I wanted to cheer her up so we went out. Jim asked how I noticed that but not months of Viv being bullied. I told him I just didn't. Mom asked to speak to me alone and she asked if I really hadn't noticed. I said I hadn't. She asked why. I told her I'm closer to Hayden and know her better so I'm more in tune with her and her life.\n\nMom told Jim and he was pissy for a few weeks. Then a couple of weeks ago Hayden wasn't feeling great and I noticed. Jim then pretty much lost it with me and said that I cared so much about Hayden to notice a slight off day with her and I didn't notice Viv when she was going through hell. He said I couldn't make it more clear that Viv doesn't matter. He told me as the oldest, as the big brother, I should be doing WAY better.

I know when something is bothering my sister but I don't pick up the same things with my stepsister. My stepsister was bullied for months and I never noticed a thing. But I can tell when my sister is at the start of a bad day or something is on her mind. This has led to some tension in our household because of the bullying that went on. I can kind of see why I might be the asshole. I mean, I live with my stepsister and we go to the same school and I never noticed she was being bullied. I know it might be hard for her and her dad to see me be so aware of my sister while not having that same awareness for her. And I might be the asshole because even when I found out, I didn't try to change my level of awareness with my stepsister. She could be feeling left out. I know my stepdad feels I disrespected both him and my stepsister.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What have they been doing as parents to be so blind. Why does it fall on you, a teenager, to do tge heavy lifting and parenting? Why are you getting called out when Jim noticed nothing going on with his own daughter?", "NTA\n\nI understand Jim is upset because his daughter was being bullied, but there was no need for him to take it out on you. He is also incorrect in wanting you to prioritize Viv as much as Hayden. You simply do not have a strong bond with Viv, and no one could blame you. You were almost 10 by the time Jim and your mother got married. You lived with Hayden for her entire life and almost your entire life.\n\nYou\u2019ve literally known Viv for less than half the time you\u2019ve been alive. You spent almost a decade knowing Hayden was your only sibling. The bond between you and Viv isn\u2019t really there, and no one could blame you.\n\nI think Jim is trying to deflect blame unfairly onto you. He does not get to complain that Viv\u2019s \u201colder brother\u201d isn\u2019t noticing her situation when he, her own **father** hasn\u2019t noticed anything. And he\u2019s known her for longer than you and Hayden have. Shame on him. And shame on him for taking it out on you.", "NTA, it appears that daddy dearest didn't notice his daughter's struggles either and surely out of everyone he should be the one most in tune with her.\nHe's trying to hold you to a standard that he isn't capable of upholding himself, which is incredibly unfair. However, I think his outburst is due to him feeling guilty for nor noticing.", "NTA, you should\u2019ve asked Jim why wasn\u2019t his daughter Viv there for Hayden when she was struggling too", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not YOur fault that she has shiotty parents who fail to take an interest, they can not fault YOU for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Jim asked how I noticed that but not months of Viv being bullied.\" .. ask hin why HE did not notice,. she is HIS kid, not yours. HE is the AH for putting HIs responsibility on YOu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Mom asked to speak to me alone and she asked if I really hadn't noticed. I said I hadn't. She asked why.\" .. Ask her why SHE hadn't noticed.", "NTA - your parents are the ones who are meant to be looking out for the children. If you knew, it is clear you would say something. Jim is feeling guilty and as a result deflecting upon anyone else.", "Good lord, even by reddit standards this is stupid. Seriously, step siblings are not the same aa actual siblings. Step kids are not the same as your own kids. \n\n I get that one can't say this on reddit, cause faaamily and kids should always be loved cause *they're* *kids*, but let's be honest. Between widowers who expect their dead spouse's parents to \"adopt\" their new kids, to people expecting their relatives to treat a stepkid they just met the same as kids they've known all their life, to  this... wtf is wrong with all these people??", "NTA- having been bullied my entire childhood and well into my 20's being bullied is humiliating so you often times don't really want to tell people close to you what is happening she more than likely was trying to handle it herself which I totally understand.  You're not a mind reader so how can you blame yourself for not knowing about any of it.", "So wait, a step sib of 8 yrs is supposed to 'know' and recognize the feels of their step sib *but not the step sibs bio dad who has full custody?!'*\n\nNo way all day! He's just feeling guilty for not noticing and projecting his guilt/anger on you \n\nJust keep telling him HE is the one person in the household that knows her best, and that he is her parent and HIS daughters well being is literally his job", "NTA. \n\nThe fact that Jim is reacting this way is complete garbage. He is making you responsible for the emotional well-being of everyone in the house, without realizing why you're so in-tune with your sister - \n\nHave you gotten counseling for your past issues with trauma? There's a reason that you're hyper attuned to Hayden's emotional state, and its not because you love her more, but because you two trauma bonded. You noticed it because being attuned to everyone's emotional state around you gave you more information while dealing with your trauma. \n\nYou didn't trauma bond with Viv because you didn't have to. You were in a stable home and you were recovering. At some point you should definitely seek counseling so that you can remain tightly bonded with Hayden but you can lose the codependency so that you can observe her emotions without experiencing her emotions. \n\nI would tell Jim to look into trauma bonded siblings, see that you and Hayden have a relatively healthy version of that (again, seek counseling), then if you're cheeky ask what he intends to do to you and Viv so that you can bond together like that. Because the kind of relationship you and Hayden has comes out of fear, not love - you had to manufacture your own.", "It's not your obligation to care for someone you don't consider family. However, it's cold to not offer any form of help or comfort when finding out Viv was bullied. Maybe you should offer Viv kind words and a shoulder to cry on if she needs it, just a kind act to help someone you live with 24/7.", "Well, just to say, it seems like after eight years, that you could make an effort to build a relationship with your step-sister. It's a clear choice that you've made not to. Doing so does not mean that you don't love your 'blood' sister; it would simply mean that you are capable of loving more than one person.  You are a but of an ass.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Because they live in the same building? She is just a glorified neighbour.", "We have a relationship. It's just not as close as the one I have with my sister.", "Aren't you supposed to be studying in school, not supervising Viv? I think Jim is taking his guilty feelings out on you, he's trying  to erase the fact that he had noticed nothing and pushed it on you.", "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that, OP. You knew how your sister would feel bc she was rejected just for sharing DNA with a man who\u2019s not in your lives anymore. It\u2019s totally unfair and an experience that only you two could share. I think Viv\u2019s incident is a separate can of worms.\n\nYour parents are also incredibly unfair for expecting y\u2019all to immediately bond. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. In this case, it just didn\u2019t happen. Jim, however, is being the most unfair by placing the blame solely on your shoulders. You\u2019d think that the only parent in her life would notice that Viv was being bullied, but I digress\u2026  \n\nYou should also NOT be doing WAY better. He\u2019s the parent, and you\u2019re not responsible for Viv, even if you were related by blood. It\u2019s his daughter and he should be the one taking responsibility.", "is there any way y\u2019all could bond with her though ? y\u2019all both have absent parents, we\u2019re forced to move in with strangers, i\u2019m sure there\u2019s some thing in there y\u2019all can bond over"]}
