But if she waited until he was born then I\u2019d have to say yes to Gary moving in because what kind of monster would keep their grandson from living with their father?\n\nI was so mad at her reason for hiding it that I yelled at her, saying that it was an incredibly manipulative thing for her to do, and I was too angry at the moment to give her an answer about Gary. I told her I needed time to process and think, and asked her not to talk to me for a little while.\n\nShe rang her mother in tears.

Her rationale was odd and unexpected. She disrespected your relationship after you have housed her (and practically him). Prior to the pregnancy their joint life choices for years were not acceptable: unemployed, using other's resources, no self directed contribution (assuming like cleaning, lawn work). \n\nYes, she manipulated you and thinks it's OK. Your ex wants you to be joyful but they are the ones who made poor choices that sucked the joy from the announcement. Help her pack to live with her mom; you can support them from afar.

Once he's got a job they can move in together.", "I'm not going to lie.  What she did does seem to be manipulative.  If something like that were to happen to me, I'd feel pretty bad about it, too.

She's 20 - not 14, So, I'd tell my daughter that she and the baby I am willing to help as much as I can. But, no. I am not raising a grown arsed man named Gary. Those would be my terms. \"You will need a job and maybe even more schooling to show me that you're committed. That's the only way I can see myself sharing this load with you. You don't get to drop this in my lap like I had an unplanned pregnancy.\" \n\nAnd your ex can support Gary if she wants. Who are you to stop her?

She brought a kid into this world with no firm foundation and the full realization that she was going to thrust that kid into your lap like a playing piece on a board.

If she was having trouble taking care of basic functions, she\u2019s going to be overwhelmed immediately. \n\nI think you should look at this as a serious cry for help. If she was already depressed, but not getting help for it, she will probably get worse. Sleep deprivation and the constant demands of taking care of a new infant when she was having trouble taking care of herself is not a good combination. \n\nWas she in denial about being pregnant? Or was the thought of doing everything too overwhelming for her, so she just did nothing until the baby was here and now she had to react?\n\nShe needs help and close monitoring, and so does your grandchild.

He has known for months she was pregnant and he still didn't go out and find some employment\n\nI don't blame you one bit because it was manipulative and I am sure disruptive to your life.

They are taking advantage of you, and you need to put your foot down now. Don't pay for anything.

The new moms class was offered by the hospital for a modest fee.  She needs guidance about motherhood and adulthood.  This is a very big change in her life and yours.

Worse to me is that the child was likely intentional based on her statements, so she created an innocent life for her own purpose. Even if it is unintentional, she's still using an innocent child as a pawn. From that it doesn't appear she honestly wants the child.

But you need to put your foot down. Whatever guilt you feel because of missing out on her childhood is irrelevant. You're saying she can't move in with her mom or Gary's parents because... they set actual boundaries? You're in the situation you're in because you most likely have not been setting proper boundaries with your daughter. Are you a bad parent? Maybe. There's a difference between being a \"nice\" parent and being a \"good\" parent. Good parents act like parents, not friends or pushovers.\n\n\nYour first step? Confirm with your ex or with Gary's parents if they're willing to take her in (note: whether or not your daughter wants to live with them is irrelevant -- it's your ex or Gary's parents willingness that matters here). I know you said you won't kick your daughter and an innocent baby out of your house, but frankly you are not going good on your daughter by enabling her behaviour and being a pushover. It's probably a better idea to go live with her mother and step-dad or with Gary's parents specifically because they're not pushovers.\n\n\nIf nobody else is willing to take her in, you need to set clear boundaries. First and foremost, Gary cannot live in your home. There is no reason for him to live in your home with or without a baby, and if you let him move in, him and your daughter will still probably never get a job, and it will be impossible to kick Gary out. Secondly, Gary cannot stay overnight *ever*. Period. I don't care how much it will upset your daughter. Next, give your daughter a time-frame to get a job that seems fair (i.e. 6 months, <1 year, etc..). After that time is up, stop paying for things that aren't necessities for life (I.e. phone plan) and charge rent. If she's going to manipulate you into living in your house, she can get a job and pay for her own phone plan and rent.\n\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this. This a situation where you can't be a pushover and where being a \"tough parent\" is necessary. If you do not set hard boundaries and deal with this situation accordingly, you're doing your daughter no favours.

I saw your comment about basically spoiling her and not having her lift a finger because she chose you over your ex. \n\nI would also suggest some counseling for yourself, given the very big and very sudden changes.

You may also want to start touching on external support (therapy) for your daughter.\n\nThey seem to literally not even have a crib, baby clothes, diapers ready to go.

Why should you have to work harder for those two to sit on their bums?   As for the ex, tell her you are so glad she feels that way.  You will let daughter know she has a place to stay!

Instead you will now look to help him find employment and help them both budget and look for their own place. That she is welcome to stay but that they can all go stay at Garry's parents for 2 days a week. I can't actually believe the audacity of your daughter. I'd also be having words with the ex wife.

This a massive violation of trust, and it's just so phenomenally stupid. She lied for months in order to manipulate you. \n\nShe is free to go live with her mom or Gary's parents. Because she is definitely taking advantage of the fact that you will not kick her out. Because at the end of the day, that's the only way you can discipline an adult child. All forms of non-abusive discipline require respect to work and she doesn't respect you. You're not gonna be able to ground her because she doesn't respect you at all. What are you gonna do take away her phone? How else is she going to do what needs to be done? \n\nI mean she is 20 and living with you, with no job or schooling or anything? What has she been doing?

You could put the money into college savings for the baby if you want. \n\nSecond, daughter has to see a therapist. If she\u2019s too sad to shower regularly and get a job, then she needs professional help. On that note, a mother who has depression prior to pregnancy is at greater risk for postpartum depression.

I promise I'm not trying to say that in a mean way.   I always want to believe the best of my kids too, but sometimes they are just a$$holes.
