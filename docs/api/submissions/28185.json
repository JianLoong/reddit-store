She has a boyfriend Gary (20m) who currently lives with his own parents. She lost her job over COVID and has felt to sad since then to look for a new one. I\u2019m not sure if Gary has ever worked but he doesn\u2019t now, mostly he just sits around my house playing X-Box and eating my food. I\u2019m not Gary\u2019s biggest fan, but my daughter loves him so I tolerate him and have always been polite to him. \n\nAbout a month ago, she went missing for a little over 3 days. While she does go out a fair bit without telling me, this was a lot longer than usual. I rang her mother and messaged Gary and any of her friends I could think of, and no one had seen her. Eventually Gary responded with a picture of a baby and \u2018Say hello to your grandson!\u2019 She had never even told my ex-wife or I that she was pregnant (for context, she\u2019s a bigger girl and had put on a couple of extra kilos over the last couple of months. While it seems obvious now in retrospect, at the time it just seemed like normal weight gain).\n\nShe and Gary bought the baby back to our house some time the next day while I was at work. When I got home, I asked her why she wouldn\u2019t tell me something like this, and she said it\u2019s because she wanted Gary to move in with us, and she knew if she\u2019d asked before the baby was born I would have said no and that she and Gary need to get themselves sorted, both get jobs, and find their own place to live before the baby comes (she\u2019s probably not wrong). But if she waited until he was born then I\u2019d have to say yes to Gary moving in because what kind of monster would keep their grandson from living with their father?\n\nI was so mad at her reason for hiding it that I yelled at her, saying that it was an incredibly manipulative thing for her to do, and I was too angry at the moment to give her an answer about Gary. I told her I needed time to process and think, and asked her not to talk to me for a little while.\n\nShe rang her mother in tears. My ex then rang me to ask how I could be so cold, and tell me that I was ruining what should be an exciting and magical time for her, my daughter, Gary and myself. She said I\u2019d look back on this in years and feel terrible that I spent the first days of my firstborn grandchild\u2019s life making everyone upset by being angry at my daughter and her boyfriend and stalling their plans to live together with the baby.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m justified in being angry about them intentionally trying to manipulate me, but everyone around me seems to think I don\u2019t have a valid reason for being bothered in the first place, and that I need to get over it, move on and let them live together.

Just wow.  It's not often people admit their manipulation right to your face like that.  Wait until you find out they were trying for the baby and it wasn't an accident,  because I'd bet money that's coming.\n\nCan they move in with mom? Sounds like she's just itching to have them.  Or move into Gary's parents' house?\n\nNTA. Having that news all dropped on you at once is huge.  \n\nIf there's no other place for your daughter to go, I do hope you let her stay, though, for the baby's sake.  But I'd tell her no overnights with Gary.  If she wants to be a happy family with him, they should have gotten jobs years ago,  but at the very least Gary needs to get his act together now and get one do they can rent their own happy family home eventually.", "NTA - Are they immature or have a developmental disability (serious)? Her rationale was odd and unexpected. She disrespected your relationship after you have housed her (and practically him). Prior to the pregnancy their joint life choices for years were not acceptable: unemployed, using other's resources, no self directed contribution (assuming like cleaning, lawn work). \n\nYes, she manipulated you and thinks it's OK. Your ex wants you to be joyful but they are the ones who made poor choices that sucked the joy from the announcement. Help her pack to live with her mom; you can support them from afar. Be sure to they get them tools to sign up for social support cause they have a lot of struggle and frustration ahead. Best to you.", "NTA Flipping heck. Incredibly manipulative of the pair of them. They should have been honest from the onset.\n\nGary should have started looking for a job prior to the baby's birth.\n\nHe doesn't have to move in. He can search for a job and visit. Once he's got a job they can move in together.", "I'm not going to lie.  What she did does seem to be manipulative.  If something like that were to happen to me, I'd feel pretty bad about it, too.  I'm going to go with NTA on this one and wish you the best of luck.", "NTA\n\nDon't let him move in. Allow visitation. This will allow him to see his kid but light a fire under their ass to get out of your house. No overnights. \n\nIf you let him move in you're screwed. She will be pregnant again in a year and they will never leave. \n\nMaybe your ex-wife can take them in? She seems pretty excited about his terrible decision for some reason.", "I wouldn\u2019t let Gary move in. I think you\u2019d be enabling bad and manipulative behaviour if you did. If your ex wife thinks they should move in together tell her they should both move in with her", "(As much as I hate yelling, NTA.) She likely hid her pregnancy because she thought that would forestall the shouting match? Not that the shock wouldn't feel provocative to me too. Trust me, I'd have swallowed my tongue hearing that.\n\nWhat she did *was* manipulative. You're not wrong in saying that out loud. And as much as I love my kids, I've never planned to be responsible for raising any kids they have - let alone taking an unemployed BF who is also a new parent into my home.\n\nThat's a lot for anyone to expect from you. She's 20 - not 14, So, I'd tell my daughter that she and the baby I am willing to help as much as I can. But, no. I am not raising a grown arsed man named Gary. Those would be my terms. \"You will need a job and maybe even more schooling to show me that you're committed. That's the only way I can see myself sharing this load with you. You don't get to drop this in my lap like I had an unplanned pregnancy.\" \n\nAnd your ex can support Gary if she wants. Who are you to stop her? People always say \"Get over it!\" like this is a solution to a problem. Don't listen. They are spinning their wheels and making no useful suggestions.", "Nta, unfortunately your daughter lost the right for you not to expressing your feelings while freshly postpartum.", "NTA\n\nIn all honesty, I can see where your daughter gets the disgustingly manipulative elements from. The moment she got pushback she ran crying like a child to mommy who proceeded to sprinkle on the \"it's magical\" sentimental crap hardcore to validate your daughters clear planned and tactical approach to wedging her boyfriend into your household.\n\nLike, people can say \"miracle of life\" all they like, but it doesn't make it seem any less like a cold blooded act to get what she wanted. She brought a kid into this world with no firm foundation and the full realization that she was going to thrust that kid into your lap like a playing piece on a board. It's disgusting, and it's equally disgusting that your ex is playing to that.", "Nta. \n\nThat was incredibly manipulative and deceitful on their part. It sounds like you ex wife is just in baby mode, not reality. You are not stealing any \u201c magical times\u201d by your reaction. They didn\u2019t make it magical in the first place, they used this strategically to get their way. And the fact that they know you would have held them accountable to acting like adults and avoided it, speaks volumes. They should go to someone who will support their delusions- like ex wife or Gary\u2019s house. It is insulting to you that they tried to pull this type of stunt.", "Assuming that you\u2019re telling the truth and not leaving out any important details about your relationship with your daughter, ynta it\u2019s extremely manipulative and disrespectful to hide something so special and important over coming forward and facing your problems head on. Your daughter should apologize to you and she needs to learn to trust you more", "NTA.", "NTA. They have no business being parents but it\u2019s too late now. You\u2019ll be supporting them all unless you put your foot down.", "If your daughter was depressed before, having a new baby is going to make it so much worse. If she was having trouble taking care of basic functions, she\u2019s going to be overwhelmed immediately. \n\nI think you should look at this as a serious cry for help. If she was already depressed, but not getting help for it, she will probably get worse. Sleep deprivation and the constant demands of taking care of a new infant when she was having trouble taking care of herself is not a good combination. \n\nWas she in denial about being pregnant? Or was the thought of doing everything too overwhelming for her, so she just did nothing until the baby was here and now she had to react?\n\nShe needs help and close monitoring, and so does your grandchild. She needs to be screened for postpartum depression and you should educate yourself about it and watch for signs. \n\nYou may have to parent your 20 year old for a while, but she and the baby are lucky to have you. Don\u2019t just give up and say not my problem.", "NTA, they can go live with Gary's parents or your ex.  Total BS I was too sad to get a job, more like I will live off my parents and expect them to support me, baby daddy, and child.  Tell her no Gary until he has a job and can pay for all baby expenses plus rent.", "NTA, If I were you I still wouldn't let Garry move in a least until he can support himself your daughter and the baby, otherwise you will be fitting the bill for a grown ass man.  He has already proven he is unmotivated because he plays video games and eats instead of going out and getting a job.  He has known for months she was pregnant and he still didn't go out and find some employment\n\nI don't blame you one bit because it was manipulative and I am sure disruptive to your life.  You deserved to be told shortly after they found out because you are supporting your daughter and now her child.  If they are not responsible enough to do things the proper way they shouldn't get the reward of Garry living in your house.", "NTA and your ex wife doesn\u2019t need to claim the magical moment crap and say you ruined it. She knew she was pregnant and withheld it to manipulate you. If she wanted magical moments she should have fessed up a long time ago and the pair of them would have taken some accountability and made a proper plan. You don\u2019t get to throw a grenade and then act shocked that other people aren\u2019t screaming with joy. I\u2019m still not sure why he hasn\u2019t got a job either? Before you even consider taking him in I\u2019d make that a condition.", "Ooof. NTA. I think this is just a shitty situation all round and I hope you manage to work it out with her so you can all continue to have a happy life and a good relationship. I don\u2019t like Gary either. I\u2019m blaming this all on Gary for no other reason than the \u201cvibe\u201d", "NTA. Gary knew about the baby. And instead of stepping up and getting a job to pay for this kid, he has the audacity to mooch off you and eat your food. Diapers are expensive, my guess is that they are going to ask you to but them a LOT of baby items. \n\nIt's one thing to help family, but they took this too a whole new level. They are taking advantage of you, and you need to put your foot down now. Don't pay for anything.  It's gonna suck and they will throw a fit.\n\nTheir plan was to manipulate you into helping them pay for things and having a free place to live.  That's not normal behavior for an adult.\n\nAlso stop buying the guy food.

She lost her job due to Covid? So she was 17...okay, she was a student so not the end of the world to not have a job. But then she turned 18 and graduated. You don't mention her going to college or continuing her education. So for two years she's been out of school and had no job because she's \"too sad to look for one?\" And you've just been supporting her?

I get the feeling they let him get away with a lot less than I do (I've heard him on the phone tell them to stop 'nagging' him and he'd do it when he got home) so that could be why she thought I'd be more likely to say yes to them?\n\n\\*editing to add - I won't throw her out, I'd never to that to her or an innocent baby!

I think her being a bit lazy and selfish is mostly on me, her mother and I divorced when she was little, and I feel like I missed out on so much when she was growing up, so since she moved in with me full-time about 5 years ago up until now I've never asked her to contribute financially or to chores. I guess I felt both guilty but also lucky that she wanted to live with me instead of my ex and didn't want to jeopardize that, and I'm realizing now how big a mistake that might have been.", "Gary is the least factor to consider IMO. \"Get a job and a life Gary.

I can't say for sure, but I think I wouldn't have been angry, or at least a lot less angry, if she'd told me beforehand. I would have expected her to at least put in some effort getting ready for the baby, even if they couldn't afford to move out together yet. I wouldn't throw her out onto the street, but I would have expected her to at least get a part-time job to afford a crib and highchair and things.", "I mentioned in another comment, but her mother and I divorced when she was little, so I feel a lot of guilt for missing out on a lot of her childhood. My ex moved away for a couple of years and I only got to see her for a week in the school holidays during that time, and only every second weekend once they moved back, so I think I've just been trying to make it up to her since then. I can see now that that was probably a mistake and may have led directly to her thinking it's okay to act like this towards me.", "Thank you, that's very kind. It's definitely possible she was feeling too depressed and couldn't find the energy to put anything into place before the baby was born. \n\nThat's good advice about keeping an eye on her and my grandson too, thank you.

This was certainly a life slam you did not expect.", "Do they both think that you will be providing everything for the baby???  NTA.  And just because your divorce didn\u2019t go smoothly, that\u2019s no excuse for her behavior.  BF needs to get a job and provide for the child.  Daughter needs to be working towards being independent of you.  None of this is on you.  It\u2019s good that you aren\u2019t kicking her out, but she can\u2019t just expect you to suck it all up.  Let the BF visit.  There is no reason he needs to move in with you.  He needs to work on his situation.  Good luck.  And don\u2019t be a door mat.", "You raise very good points. How responsible was she during her pregnancy? Did she attend regular Dr. appts, follow through on direction (e.g., prenatal vitamins),.....did her depression get in the way of doing these tasks? Most parents with little to no money still seek out basics: diapers, car seat...etc. Did she connect with non-profit/NGOs who help poor moms? If she did not do these things it is alarming. Coping with an infant who has their own schedule can be physically and mentally draining. This birth may rally her focus to thrive or it could go south. Her connecting to services, a mom support group, therapy, etc could make a difference. Sorry if this feels overwhelming; just wanted you to know."]}
