While she does go out a fair bit without telling me, this was a lot longer than usual. I rang her mother and messaged Gary and any of her friends I could think of, and no one had seen her. Eventually Gary responded with a picture of a baby and \u2018Say hello to your grandson!\u2019 She had never even told my ex-wife or I that she was pregnant (for context, she\u2019s a bigger girl and had put on a couple of extra kilos over the last couple of months.

When I got home, I asked her why she wouldn\u2019t tell me something like this, and she said it\u2019s because she wanted Gary to move in with us, and she knew if she\u2019d asked before the baby was born I would have said no and that she and Gary need to get themselves sorted, both get jobs, and find their own place to live before the baby comes (she\u2019s probably not wrong). But if she waited until he was born then I\u2019d have to say yes to Gary moving in because what kind of monster would keep their grandson from living with their father?\n\nI was so mad at her reason for hiding it that I yelled at her, saying that it was an incredibly manipulative thing for her to do, and I was too angry at the moment to give her an answer about Gary. I told her I needed time to process and think, and asked her not to talk to me for a little while.\n\nShe rang her mother in tears. My ex then rang me to ask how I could be so cold, and tell me that I was ruining what should be an exciting and magical time for her, my daughter, Gary and myself.

Her rationale was odd and unexpected. She disrespected your relationship after you have housed her (and practically him). Prior to the pregnancy their joint life choices for years were not acceptable: unemployed, using other's resources, no self directed contribution (assuming like cleaning, lawn work). \n\nYes, she manipulated you and thinks it's OK. Your ex wants you to be joyful but they are the ones who made poor choices that sucked the joy from the announcement. Help her pack to live with her mom; you can support them from afar.

She's 20 - not 14, So, I'd tell my daughter that she and the baby I am willing to help as much as I can. But, no. I am not raising a grown arsed man named Gary.

You don't get to drop this in my lap like I had an unplanned pregnancy.\" \n\nAnd your ex can support Gary if she wants. Who are you to stop her?

If she was having trouble taking care of basic functions, she\u2019s going to be overwhelmed immediately. \n\nI think you should look at this as a serious cry for help. If she was already depressed, but not getting help for it, she will probably get worse. Sleep deprivation and the constant demands of taking care of a new infant when she was having trouble taking care of herself is not a good combination. \n\nWas she in denial about being pregnant? Or was the thought of doing everything too overwhelming for her, so she just did nothing until the baby was here and now she had to react?\n\nShe needs help and close monitoring, and so does your grandchild.

He has known for months she was pregnant and he still didn't go out and find some employment\n\nI don't blame you one bit because it was manipulative and I am sure disruptive to your life.

They are taking advantage of you, and you need to put your foot down now. Don't pay for anything.

The new moms class was offered by the hospital for a modest fee.  She needs guidance about motherhood and adulthood.  This is a very big change in her life and yours.  You need to let go of feeling guilty over her childhood.  The best gift you can give her now is the tools to succeed in motherhood and adulthood.  You are going to need to coach and guide her.

Worse to me is that the child was likely intentional based on her statements, so she created an innocent life for her own purpose. Even if it is unintentional, she's still using an innocent child as a pawn. From that it doesn't appear she honestly wants the child. She just wanted her bf to move in and that was the \"best\" way she could think of to accomplish that. \n\nSo why are you an asshole?

Make them sign this and notarize it ao it's a legally-binding document which you might need if you need to evict them!

But you need to put your foot down. Whatever guilt you feel because of missing out on her childhood is irrelevant. You're saying she can't move in with her mom or Gary's parents because... they set actual boundaries? You're in the situation you're in because you most likely have not been setting proper boundaries with your daughter. Are you a bad parent? Maybe. There's a difference between being a \"nice\" parent and being a \"good\" parent. Good parents act like parents, not friends or pushovers.\n\n\nYour first step? Confirm with your ex or with Gary's parents if they're willing to take her in (note: whether or not your daughter wants to live with them is irrelevant -- it's your ex or Gary's parents willingness that matters here). I know you said you won't kick your daughter and an innocent baby out of your house, but frankly you are not going good on your daughter by enabling her behaviour and being a pushover. It's probably a better idea to go live with her mother and step-dad or with Gary's parents specifically because they're not pushovers.\n\n\nIf nobody else is willing to take her in, you need to set clear boundaries. First and foremost, Gary cannot live in your home. There is no reason for him to live in your home with or without a baby, and if you let him move in, him and your daughter will still probably never get a job, and it will be impossible to kick Gary out. Secondly, Gary cannot stay overnight *ever*. Period. I don't care how much it will upset your daughter. Next, give your daughter a time-frame to get a job that seems fair (i.e. 6 months, <1 year, etc..). After that time is up, stop paying for things that aren't necessities for life (I.e. phone plan) and charge rent. If she's going to manipulate you into living in your house, she can get a job and pay for her own phone plan and rent.\n\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this. This a situation where you can't be a pushover and where being a \"tough parent\" is necessary. If you do not set hard boundaries and deal with this situation accordingly, you're doing your daughter no favours.

If her mother thinks it's ok, she can take her in. \nYou're NTA if you don't allow the baby's daddy in anymore, and in fact should put an ultimatum on your daughter to 1) get a job 2)Ask child support from the father 3) find some childcare solution that is not you.

I'd be NC from here out.", "They knew there was a child on the way. They did nothing. They will continue to do nothing as long as you allow it.  They need jobs. You have an obligation to try your best to produce a functional adult. Like, you can stay provided xyz with the goal of having your own apt by a particular date.  The 1st thing though is jobs. One works day shift and the other night shift so there is someone to care for the child.", "NTA but I also would not let Gary move in either. She\u2019ll probably says she hates you for a long time but they made grown up choices and need to now grow up. That means getting jobs to support themselves.

I'm so sorry.", "What kind of monster would keep their grandson from living with their father? Me, I'm that monster.

You don't have to take the baby, but you'd be lucky to have custody by the time I'm done. Manipulation is met with everything you don't want.

I think I would have kicked them all out for a night between my CPTSD and the blatant disrespect. \n\nBless you, because wow. \n\nNTA. \n\nSit them down and figure out an actual, tangible plan with goals. \n\nOne or both need jobs. Gary at the very, very least. \n\nDaughter could probably use some counseling, I\u2019m wondering if she could be experiencing post-partum along with her depression. \n\nSavings plan, bills, schedule for care for the baby, etc. \n\nAnd please, try to be hands off for a while. I saw your comment about basically spoiling her and not having her lift a finger because she chose you over your ex. \n\nI would also suggest some counseling for yourself, given the very big and very sudden changes.

I would lead with your faults (sorry I didn\u2019t prepare you by giving you responsibility and holding you accountable) but the real meat of this is to put them on a path to self sufficiency. Start with an allowance. You are clearly already paying them, now force them to make the purchase decisions, force them to choose between baby wipes and pizza delivery.  You may also want to start touching on external support (therapy) for your daughter.\n\nThey seem to literally not even have a crib, baby clothes, diapers ready to go.

If they are old enough to have a baby, they are old enough to be responsible parents and figure out how to support themselves as a family. \n\nI don't see why Gary should get a free home just because he knocked up your daughter. Don't make things too comfortable for them, and they might be motivated to get their own place.", "NTA but now there needs to be a plan. Your daughter has proven she can't be trusted.

Why should you have to work harder for those two to sit on their bums?   As for the ex, tell her you are so glad she feels that way.  You will let daughter know she has a place to stay!

I would tell her she is an adult and a parent now and that trying to manipulate you blatantly is not going to do her any favours in the long run and Garry isn't moving in. Instead you will now look to help him find employment and help them both budget and look for their own place. That she is welcome to stay but that they can all go stay at Garry's parents for 2 days a week. I can't actually believe the audacity of your daughter. I'd also be having words with the ex wife. Not normal behaviour!", "YTA that she didn't feel sho could tell you because she knew your reaction.\n\nIt looks like she was right.\n\nYou have a right to be annoyed at the attempt at manipulation but in comparison to actually having a daughter with a new baby who needs help and support now, your right to be annoyed is inconsequential.\n\nSuck it up grandad your daughter needs you.", "NTA.

This a massive violation of trust, and it's just so phenomenally stupid. She lied for months in order to manipulate you. \n\nShe is free to go live with her mom or Gary's parents. Because she is definitely taking advantage of the fact that you will not kick her out. Because at the end of the day, that's the only way you can discipline an adult child. All forms of non-abusive discipline require respect to work and she doesn't respect you. You're not gonna be able to ground her because she doesn't respect you at all. What are you gonna do take away her phone? How else is she going to do what needs to be done? \n\nI mean she is 20 and living with you, with no job or schooling or anything? What has she been doing?

I would feel inclined to then give her an eviction notice and tell her that her lies have created this situation and her attempted manipulations. Gary needs to get off his ass and get a job to support his child.", "NTA.  Don't let her manipulate you and if you ex is so invested, she should take them all in.  \n\nIt's probably too late for meaningful change but your deadbeat daughter and babydaddy need a lesson.", "NTA\n\nWhen he gets a full time job, he can move in, and pay rent you will return to them to move out.", "NTA, but I would set some ground rules. \n\nFirst, no Gary. Until he gets and keeps a job and can contribute something financially to the household. Not saying they need to pay market value rent, but they need to learn how to budget and save so they can work toward independence. You could put the money into college savings for the baby if you want. \n\nSecond, daughter has to see a therapist. If she\u2019s too sad to shower regularly and get a job, then she needs professional help. On that note, a mother who has depression prior to pregnancy is at greater risk for postpartum depression. Therapy needs to start ASAP. \n\nThird, she needs to take on responsibility for some chores. If you do decide to keep Gary around, dare I say they need to take on ALL of the chores until they have jobs if they\u2019re both living there for free. Who knows, maybe having chores at home May inspire them to find jobs outside of the home. \n\nNow that you share a grandchild, I think you need to meet and develop a relationship with Gary\u2019s parents.

And you need her to step up and participate in paying her rent and bills for the sake of the baby. She also needs to put Gary on support orders so he\u2019s paying his portion too and you get paid some of that for housing and feeding them.  That needs to be a condition of her staying.", "WTF is too *sad* to get a job for over 3 years? Not sad she can\u2019t find one but sad she lost one.

Or she can stay and Gary can come visit for 2 hours everyday\u2026after he finds a job.", "NTA- Gary made no effort to prepare for parenthood- needs to show some now.", "NTA \n\nSay that Gary can only visit, no overnights. He needs to be able to bond and be a parent to this baby so having access is important, and if baby lives at your house, shuffling the poor thing around isn\u2019t healthy. Court ordered custody usually doesn\u2019t allow this until the baby is several months old. Help your daughter apply for childcare assistance, so when she\u2019s 3+ month\u2019s postpartum she can get a job.

I don't know what they might be, but you need resources to help them without enabling them.  I get that baby is here and they intentionally presented you with a fait accompli, but you need to put your own life preserver on first.  Your money needs to start going towards your retirement now.

Make him grow up or get out.", "People can be lazy and manipulative for many reasons that don't have a clinical diagnoses. \n\nShe could very well be depressed, but that is not what drove her to deliberately manipulate OP into letting her bf move in with him so he can support all 3 of them. Depression is not an excuse to treat the people who are supporting you like garbage. \n\nIf you want to be compassionate, why not consider that OP is co-dependent and putting all the on focus on his daughter's (now imaginary) dx is making it more difficult for him to detach? It's just as likely.", "And birth control!!", "Daughter hasn\u2019t worked for almost 3 years, and who knows if the BF ever had a job? This isn\u2019t happening just because a baby\u2019s coming; they\u2019re prepared to sponge off OP.", "there's only call centers and cutsomer service calls. it doesn't pay well. but you're right a job is a job.", "**Someone** has to care for the baby.", "I had a co worker who worked literally til a week or less before she was due, ended up birthing the baby a few days after her last shift.  She came back to work literally within a month or less, as soon as she found someone (I believe her mom) to watch the baby while she worked.  She didn\u2019t have a good relationship with the parent watching her baby, like I said I believe it\u2019s the mom, but she didn\u2019t spend time with her she just would let her have the baby & the mom loved that, because a good chunk of moms love taking care of a new born for a bit here n there.  Very nostalgic for them, unless they\u2019re psychotic lol", "What the hell is wrong with you? This is a new human life - it\u2019s not his fault that his parents are deadbeats. If OP has been generous enough to support his daughter for the last 2-3 years, then he\u2019s probably ok with doing it for another year while she takes on the full-time job of being a mother. Close bonding is essential for healthy psychological development, and it might help her get her priorities in order, too. Forcing her out into a minimum wage job that pays less than child care would cost is punitive and short-sighted. The costs to the child would be horrific.", "Women going to work too soon after having a baby is extremely detrimental to the women\u2019s health.  You need time to heal physically and mentally PPD IS A SERIOUS thing", "Everyone who gives birth gets torn open one way or another!", "But everyone recovers and has to feed and change the baby.", "Nursing can still be bottle fed. It aint that mr cranky \ud83e\udd23", "Oh well then never mind!", "OP needs to seriously lay down his stakes about what his role in childcare will be and how long he wants them in his house for. Also they both need to get jobs ASAP ffs", "Yeah, that is normally the case when immature people, regardless of marital status, have children they are ill equipped to support and nurture. Such is life.", ">Your daughter has been \u201ctoo sad\u201d to look for work since 2020???\n\nThis fucking kills me. I have a friend who's on disability for depression. He's mostly stable right now, which means he's only been in in-patient care once in the last year, for about two weeks, which is *really good* for him. The five suicide attempts (that I know about) and the many additional preventative hospitalizations and the days and weeks where he can only get out of bed to shower and eat if someone comes over and forces him to are what it looks like to be \"too sad\" to work. It doesn't look like this conniving nonsense.", "Gary needs to be marched off to the closest Armed Forces recruitment office and enlisted.  He and OP\u2019s daughter should get married so he can then get housing for them.  Considering their lack of jobs and general maturity, I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t using protection either.", "Diagnosed major depressive disorder. \"Too sad\" is not a good enough excuse to just do nothing in the house all day every day. Depression makes doing anything difficult but I know I have to force myself or have someone with me. It's hard but it can be done with the right supports. There's days or weeks you're going to rot and do nothing ngl. \n\nCOVID layoffs affected everyone differently, job hunting can does feel defeating and discouraging. However it's been two years with absolutely nothing?! Hell a job at McDonald's is at least better than nothing!", "acknowledging that someone may be depressed isn\u2019t the same as pseudo diagnosing them. only doctors can diagnose people, and i don\u2019t think that by considering that they attempting to diagnose her, just to empathize and unsteady her behavior. something can be a reason but not an excuse. \n\nwhy do you think that depression didn\u2019t drive her to do those things? and if you are right, what\u2019s the importance of making this distinction?\n\nseems like you feel like compassion for her comes with the cost of allowing op to remain vulnerable and imo that\u2019s not the case. not only have some people told him directly to stop being a pushover but at it\u2019s core empathy isn\u2019t a road to codependency. those are two separate tracks. codependency is selfish, empathy is selfless", "I WFH doing customer service via email, no phone calls ever. It doesn't pay amazingly well but does pay more than minimum wage (my salary works out to about $18.80 CAD an hour) and it's easy af if you don't mind dealing with incredibly stupid people. Plus, I can waste time on Reddit, do laundry, dishes, etc in between replying to tickets.\n\nI won't reveal the name of the app I work for for obvious reasons, but many popular companies like Slack, Shopify, etc apparently also have remote customer support positions.", "Yea they probably want ol pawpaw to be free childcare.", "And that\u2019s where grandpa enters the picture. I bet she\u2019d want to spend time with Gary, partner bonding, decompression, whatnot away from baby and will toss him to OP.", "The potential parents have both demonstrated they have no regard for OP. A baby is going to suddenly compel them to focus on \u201chealthy psychological development?\u201d Think again.", "I guess she should have thought of that before getting pregnant and deciding to keep the baby WHILE manipulating her father and mother at the same time.  Am I supposed to have some sort of sympathy for this moron?", "I too lost my job right at the start of Covid and guess what ended up helping IMMENSELY to get me out of my depressive state? \n\n*Getting a job*. With benefits. For therapy. And medication. And for something to do with my days and people to talk to lol", "No intent to offend. I do understand depression. OP wrote \u201ctoo sad\u201d not struggling with depression.  I took him at his word, which may have been wrong. \n\nIf she has MDD, she needs to see a doctor and get therapy. Writing her off as \u201csad\u201d and letting her lie dormant for years is not helping her. That alone would make OP T A H. 20 years old and doing nothing is only going to make it worse, not better. Like you, she may need a little push to re-enter the world.", "I wish I had read the additions to your comment before. \n\nThe time for compassion has passed. There is a child in the world that this sad woman put here. If she wanted compassion for herself, maybe she would have thought about that through her depressive fog sometime before getting pregnant, hiding, it and then laughing in OP's face about tricking him all these months. Oh well. Too late!\n\nSo you are sure OP is just empathic and not co-dependent. I'd say handicapping your adult child because you feel guilty about not being around when they were a kid pretty selfish. \u270c\ufe0f", "Because OP is the one here asking for help, and randomly picking a dx that excuses her behavior, while convenient for interesting Reddit comments, is not reality. So if we are playing like we know, I would suggest at least some fairness in the process, and assume OP also has a dx that makes him a pushover. \n\nOP's daughter could be depressed. She could also have a personality disorder or ADHD or autism or any number of dx that would explain this. She could also just be an AH. We don't know. But we do know that OP has gotten himself in a situation where somebody (dx or not) is taking advantage of him severely. Putting the focus back on her is not helping him, IMO. And in fact, it's making it worse since instead of focusing on his issue, he is again being steered toward her issues again. While she happily plays x box.", "Free childcare? They don't work. They want pawpaw to support them as well.", "Right?! Like, I'm certainly not going to say that losing your job to the pandemic wasn't hard, or didn't lead some people into depression. (Hell, that's how I wound up living with my roommate--he desperately needed to find somewhere new to live with someone who could help with expenses.) I just *really* don't think that's what's going on here.\n\nLike, even if she is struggling with her mental health a bit, if she's got the energy to conspire with her dirtbag boyfriend about her pregnancy, she's got the energy to get a damn job.", "In some fairness, depression presents differently person to person. Also we don't have the full context either. OP could just be saying \"too sad\" like a dismissive tone, or the daughter could've used this as another manipulation tactic (I have seen people weaponize conditions) . If she has been struggling with depression she needs to get help and setting structures to getting better or at the very least managing it. Doing nothing at all is going to make it worse. The fact that this has gone on for two years with no attempts from either side is concerning.", "if you say so lol. but idk if you\u2019re gonna keep your audience very long with that attitude, and it seems like quite a shame to have so much passion for a topic and then be completely ignored after your first or second sentence", "well again no one diagnosed her and even if they did it wouldn\u2019t be an excuse. reasons are not excuses. as for the dad, sure i guess someone could contemplate what\u2019s impacting him but but folks aren\u2019t trying to figure out his behavior since he\u2019s here to explain it \n\ni disagree with the last part. since this is a situation about his relationship with his daughter  then ignoring his focuses would be kinda dismissive and probably won\u2019t resonate with him. if you act like you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re talking to a loving dad, then you won\u2019t show the empathy necessary for him to feel related to. also he wants to help her. that\u2019s one of his goals. so in order to truly help him you would have to acknowledge and respect what his goals are instead of projecting your own onto him. \n\nright now the best thing to help her would be setting her up for long term independence, and figuring out why she isn\u2019t farther along already  which is what people are doing", "100% and if her mental health is truly holding her back from getting better then either dad has to step in in a big way or she will never get better. Depression is not the common cold it doesn\u2019t just ~go away.", "Oh, low blow. Do you always go personal when someone doesn't agree with you?  I hope you spend as much time dx yourself as you do on Reddit. There's help for that. \n\nOr maybe just another AH?", "Hey guys we found Gary!"]}
