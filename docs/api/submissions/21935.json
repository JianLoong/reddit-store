There is 3 floors and we live in the basement. As an example, i can hear the neighbors above us when they stomp or drop something. \n\nAt the time, the apartment above us was empty but there was a man living on the top floor, who would get drunk and play excessively loud metal music sometimes late into the night when my son (who was 6 months old) was trying to sleep. He would wail for hours sometimes because of it. My boyfriend would have to go up there often to bang on the guys door until he would finally hear him, and say he would turn it down, just to continue turning it up. This was an ongoing thing, every couple days neighbor would come home and put on his racket. So eventually getting fed up, my boyfriend was working nightshift and i decided to wait and put up with it until midnight, so i was within legal guidelines to call authorities.\n\nAfter calling the cops, they spoke with him, and i now i rarely ever hear his music. But he gives me dirty looks everytime he sees me or my family. So AITA? We try to be respectful with our neighbors, cause i dont want any ill will between us. But that guy, knowing we had a baby and still doing it, really grinded my gears, and i have no regrets.", "created_utc": 1689077970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wptfu/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_noisy_neighbor/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you could have pointed it out to the landlord or leasing agent but honestly all was within reason.\n\nAlso hearing music through 2 floors he must be playing it excessively loudly.

I mitigate with headphones. It's not that hard. All my neighbors just know not to knock if they need me; text cause otherwise I won't hear.", "Where i live its after 12, but technically in my lease its \"quite time\" after 9 during the week and 10 on weekends. Which i had contacted my landlord about but they basically did nothing.", "My landlord told me to hash it out with him, but tbh it probably would have ended up in a fist fight, lol my boyfriend was already debating", "I did actually, they said they left him an email because apparently the guy didnt have a number. But they didnt do anything else it still continued", "I realize that, but we arent the only people in the building with a kid, regardless you should be respectful if you live an apartment complex.", "Lol \u201cice cream paint job\u201d. I haven\u2019t heard that in so long.", "I love music too, but i always try to keep mine on a lower volume while i clean, cause i dont like disturbing my neighbors.", "Even better following all the channels. Proud of you OP.", "Thank you \ud83e\udee1", "NTA for calling the cops. I might also mention to the manager/landlord what happened too, if you haven't already, so there's a record of it. This may come in handy due to possible retaliation, in case the neighbor tries to get back at you (always a risk when reporting a neighbor to the cops).", "No you are not the asshole. I feel you on this and my partner and I will do the same thing with our neighbors as well when it\u2019s pass a set time. So no you are not and you should keep doing so every time you hear it.

And we tried to handle it responsibly and respectfully.", "Im aware, i havent mentioned to the landlord because im giving him benifet of the doubt. So far hes been very respectful, and tbh i dont think it would make a difference for my landlord cause they live in the city.

I have no doubt it is loud but that\u2019s also something to consider. \n\nStill, you did good. Let neighbour bring grouchy. He can get headphones.", "Holy hell NTA. \n\nI have people that live a FULL STREET OVER, with another house, that front lawn, a street, and MY front lawn before you get to my house , and from July 4 through July 7, it was like living above a night club. Literally, the windows were shaking. \n\nPolice finally showed up at 4am. Haven't heard from the people since. But I randomly got added on What's App to some group chat, and the words fuck you were the message. Welp. They wanna start that shit, I'll just get a restraining order at that point.", "NTA.
