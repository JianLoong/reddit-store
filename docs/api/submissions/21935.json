There is 3 floors and we live in the basement. As an example, i can hear the neighbors above us when they stomp or drop something. \n\nAt the time, the apartment above us was empty but there was a man living on the top floor, who would get drunk and play excessively loud metal music sometimes late into the night when my son (who was 6 months old) was trying to sleep. He would wail for hours sometimes because of it. My boyfriend would have to go up there often to bang on the guys door until he would finally hear him, and say he would turn it down, just to continue turning it up. This was an ongoing thing, every couple days neighbor would come home and put on his racket. So eventually getting fed up, my boyfriend was working nightshift and i decided to wait and put up with it until midnight, so i was within legal guidelines to call authorities.\n\nAfter calling the cops, they spoke with him, and i now i rarely ever hear his music. But he gives me dirty looks everytime he sees me or my family. So AITA? We try to be respectful with our neighbors, cause i dont want any ill will between us. But that guy, knowing we had a baby and still doing it, really grinded my gears, and i have no regrets.\n\nEdit: i didnt realize my post would get this much attention lol thanks to everyone who commented, and those who gave me a bit of a laugh, you guys are all right in my book.", "created_utc": 1689077970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wptfu/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_noisy_neighbor/", "score": 272, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He gave you no other choice", "NTA\n\nYou asked nicely they did not reciprocate. Maybe you could have pointed it out to the landlord or leasing agent but honestly all was within reason.\n\nAlso hearing music through 2 floors he must be playing it excessively loudly. I like to listen to rock and metal music also but I don't play it loud enough for it to travel through 2 floors. At least not nearer to night anyway.", "NTA for this.

I mitigate with headphones. It's not that hard. All my neighbors just know not to knock if they need me; text cause otherwise I won't hear.", "Where i live its after 12, but technically in my lease its \"quite time\" after 9 during the week and 10 on weekends. Which i had contacted my landlord about but they basically did nothing.", "My landlord told me to hash it out with him, but tbh it probably would have ended up in a fist fight, lol my boyfriend was already debating", "I did actually, they said they left him an email because apparently the guy didnt have a number. But they didnt do anything else it still continued", "I realize that, but we arent the only people in the building with a kid, regardless you should be respectful if you live an apartment complex.", "Lol \u201cice cream paint job\u201d. I haven\u2019t heard that in so long.", "I love music too, but i always try to keep mine on a lower volume while i clean, cause i dont like disturbing my neighbors.", "Even better following all the channels. Proud of you OP.", "Thank you \ud83e\udee1", "NTA for calling the cops. I might also mention to the manager/landlord what happened too, if you haven't already, so there's a record of it. This may come in handy due to possible retaliation, in case the neighbor tries to get back at you (always a risk when reporting a neighbor to the cops).", "No you are not the asshole. I feel you on this and my partner and I will do the same thing with our neighbors as well when it\u2019s pass a set time. So no you are not and you should keep doing so every time you hear it. And our time is ten on weekdays and 2 in the morning on weekends.", "Well i could tell he was just doing it to spite us at that point, thats what really made me mad. And we tried to handle it responsibly and respectfully.", "Im aware, i havent mentioned to the landlord because im giving him benifet of the doubt. So far hes been very respectful, and tbh i dont think it would make a difference for my landlord cause they live in the city. They never come down here to see the apartment, even tho it needs work.", "Were also planning on moving out soon, since we are in a one bedroom.", "2 am? Wow, thats late... well im glad to hear im not alone on this", "Lol yeah you are not and yes 2a.m and I think it\u2019s late as well but that\u2019s the rules Philadelphia", "NTA.\n\nThough, I will point out that an empty apartment above you is going to amplify the music. I have no doubt it is loud but that\u2019s also something to consider. \n\nStill, you did good. Let neighbour bring grouchy. He can get headphones.", "Holy hell NTA. \n\nI have people that live a FULL STREET OVER, with another house, that front lawn, a street, and MY front lawn before you get to my house , and from July 4 through July 7, it was like living above a night club. Literally, the windows were shaking. \n\nPolice finally showed up at 4am. Haven't heard from the people since. But I randomly got added on What's App to some group chat, and the words fuck you were the message. Welp. They wanna start that shit, I'll just get a restraining order at that point.", "NTA. There is a informal social contract and actually there\u2019s laws about things like this. You are nicer than me.", "No it was you could hear it in the hallways, it sounded like we were at a rock concert, no joke...", "That\u2019s frustrating. \n\nMan needs some catalogues from an electronic store shoved in his mailbox every week.", "I'd take dirty looks over not being able to sleep any day, and I'd return his dirty looks with one-finger salutes.", "NTA. good job!", "NTA he can just use headphones so I don't understand what his problem is", "NTA. There\u2019s a certain level of noise to be expected when you\u2019re sharing walls/floors/ceilings in an apartment building. Music so loud it keeps a baby awake two floors down all throughout the night is well beyond that. What did he *think* was going to happen?", "NTA. The neighbour deserved it for being too noisy. If you wanna make a ton of noise, go get a house out in the country.", "NTA. Did you complain to the apartment complex?", "NTA, at all.  Noise ordinances exist because of AH like this guy.", "Most people don\u2019t play music late into the night in apartment building to the point the cops are needed, it\u2019s the trashy outliers of society.", "You guys were nice enough to tried and communicate w both that tenant AND the landlord before calling the police? That says it all. NTA", "NTA, where I am, it's summer so we all have our balcony doors open. The neighbor below me plays music that has some language in it I don't want my work to hear while he chills on the deck...the solution? When I had a scheduled meeting, I asked if he could turn it down for a half hour, since at the time it was loud enough to hear through the glass doors fully closed.   \nLike a sane person when asked nicely...he...turned down the music for a half hour. (He also doesn't blare it like that late at night, so all is good!)", "NTA you tried to be nice neighbors and it didn't work. he's trying to make you feel guilty for not submitting to his rudness.", "NTA, but at the same time you brought a baby who undoubtedly cries all the time into an apartment. I am sure your neighbors all hate that when they're trying to sleep. How would you feel if someone called and complained about that noise? Hell, maybe he played the music to drown out the noise he was forced to hear.", "Freedom\u2019s limits are up to where you bother somebody else. So he can listen to whatever he wants as long as he doesn\u2019t bother his neighbors. You did the right thing.", "Jesus, thats crazy. I dont understand why some people feel the need to disrupt a neighborhood. I get it, people like to party. I dont personally, but people should have some consideration for others.", "\ud83e\udd23 love that", "Yes i did, he was sent an email via our landlord but nothing changed.", "First of all, i moved in here while i was 9 months pregnant, i didnt want to live here but this is what was available to us close to my partners work.\nSecond, i am fully aware babies are not quiet beings especially since hes now in the babbling stage. And im already looking to move out since this is a one bedroom. And honestly man you can't just tell a baby to be quiet. I have told my neighbors that if hes being too loud to let me know, which no one has yet to come speak with me yet.", "You should also know that this neighborhood is largely an older neighborhood. The majority of the people who live here at 50+ with a smattering of young couples with children. I don't live on frat row \ud83d\ude02", "Oh my goodness lol", "I thought about buying him a pair of headphones and leaving them infront of his door lol", "Noise ordinances and curfews are a thing. Dude was entirely in the wrong that's not on you. Sorry you had to deal with that. NTA", "NTA. I am fortunate to live in a house, but our neighbors behind us play music so loud that it sounds like a nightclub in our house. They are always shouting at and fighting (actual hitting/punching) each other and are unapproachable for a number of other reasons. We've tried talking to them, and we tolerate as much as we can but when it gets excessive we call the cops."]}
