Both of our families have not seen her yet as we live abroad. This summer we are going back to our country to see the families and let them meet our kid. Now my parents don't care much for religion, I am atheist or at least agnostic/couldn't care less, my gf raised catholic now doesn't care much, her family on the other hand is very radical Catholics. Church every Sunday. No pre-marital sex. My gf's mum, she respects our views. The real problem are her mum's brother's families that are so obsessive. They constantly ask when my kid is going to be christened. They bring that up on family gatherings when my gf calls her mum at that time. Her uncle's daughter (40y.o virgin, cannot find a man, too devoted to the church) sent us a gift when our kid was born. A picture of guardian angel with a note \"I hope the guardian angel will protect your kid from the devil, till you understand that only way to clean her of the original sin is by christening\". I would have no problem with the guardian angel, I want my daughter to know about god, but the note was out of order. After that, my GF told me her cousin, on multiple occasions, started discussion with her over messenger trying to convince her that we have to christen our kid. Her other uncle is pretty much in the same boat and so is her mum's auntie (devoted, single old teacher that again is obsessively religious, she serves as a kind of matron figure for the family) bring this up every time they are visiting her mum. \n\nWhen we will to be visiting her family, I will be there for the 2nd time in my life for few days, I know what will happen and I already know they are staging intervention. My gf begged me not to start any discussion and I respect that. But she also said to me not to tell off her family if they will bring this up.\n\nI am argumentative and confrontations don't scare me, regardless of who this is (her whole family is scared of the matron and even if it doesn't suit them, even financially they will do what she tells them to). I feel very strong about the fact, that I want MY child to have a blank slate and when she is mature enough to make her decision about religion.\n\nI don't want to make her family uncomfortable, or my gf or her mum who will be hosting us, but I am really worried that confrontation is inevitable.\n\nSo my idea, which I presented to my gf, is that before anyone starts anything, I want to say to all of them \"Religion will not be a subject to discuss during our visit. We have never told them how to raise their kids, and I respect they are religious, so I would love them to be just as respectful and keep their opinions to themselves\".\n\nI am also scared that they will convince her to get our daughter christened when I will not be there (my gf frequently will do things to please her family just to avoid confrontation cause \"it's easier that way) as our families live far apart and I want to spend more time with my parents who are ill health.", "created_utc": 1675847313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ws2o2/wibta_to_tell_my_gfs_family_they_have_no_right_to/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the other parent refuses baptism can't be performed.\n\nYour child's religion is a choice between you and your GF as her mother.  As long as your GF is in agreement with you that is fine.\n\nI would query your comment that \"I want MY child to have a blank slate\".  This is not only YOUR child.  This is also your GF's child.

You have no plans to raise your child as Catholic:\n\n*Canon law (Canon 868) also requires that for an infant to be baptized licitly:*\n\n*\"1. the parents or at least one of them or the person who legitimately takes their place must consent.*\n\n*\"2.* ***there must be a founded hope that the infant will be brought up in the Catholic Religion***; if such hope is altogether lacking, the baptism is to be delayed according to the prescripts of particular law after the parents have been advised about the reason.\"", "The Satanic Temple offers \"unbaptisement\" FYI.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But you don't need to make a big speech. \"No\" is more than enough.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't think this is the hill you should die on. If you're an atheist, then you know that a baptism does literally nothing. The great thing about atheism is that there is no god to punish you for lying. Focus on the things with actual tangible impact, like if they want to send her to Catholic school or something like that.", "NTA.   \nThey need to be told this in the strongest possible terms. And let their church know you aren\u2019t planning on having your daughter christened, so it doesn\u2019t happen behind your back.", "NTA.\nTell them that they should know that baptism is a symbol of a conscious decision, and that their religion bastardized it into what it is today.", "Uhm, what does christened exactly entail?\n\nI mean I get why you don't want it, I'm totally on your side in all of this but... Whats the worst thats gonna happen? They spray some wather on the child? I mean, it's not like they can force it to church and stuff after?\n\nBtw: Would be hilarious if you paint the Hindu-Dot (sry, don't know how it's called) on your daughters forehead before visiting :]", "NTA. Her family is though as they have no respect for anyone who isn't a part of their religion. I think you should make the announcement. Your GF's unwillingness to stand up for her family is bothersome as well.", "NTA and explain to your GF clearly that you have your parents health to worry about please don't do anything without you. And let her know she can tell them that. They sound very culty encourage your GF just to repeat the same thing and not engage them in further conversation of sort.", "NTA. You should have complete control over what religions your kid gets exposed to. \n\nBut maybe don't open with your rule and instead only bring it up if they bring it up. You know they will bring it up eventually because they are that type of people, but you come off a little better if you are responding to rather than starting the argument...and you know there will probably be an argument.", "NTA\n\nTell them if they push the subject, then the child will start going to your local Mosque every weekend.", "It's important that you and your GF agree on how to deal with her family's role/reaction in your lives, and not wanting to start big confrontations is a valid position for your GF to take, so that's worth respecting.\n\nYou don't need to start with a declaration - that is basically inviting conflict under the pretense of avoiding it. Say your line if they raise the topic, not before. Asking them to stay out of how y'all raise your kid is also valid. \n\nBut it won't be effective, so you and she need to agree on the game plan to deal with that. And frankly, I would say that arguing with them about it will do absolutely nothing. Stonewalling is likely to work better all round.\n\nAlso, while they need to butt out, why are you scared of your daughter getting christened? From an agnostic point of view, it's just a bit of water and some words. As long as you keep the uncles/cousins out of her life enough not to preach as she grows up, christening won't make a lick of difference to anything.", "NTA - my wife and I aren't religious at all (atheists) but her mom and grandmother are both very catholic. We also live in a predominantly catholic country where almost everyone get's baptized and goes through confirmation even if they aren't religious because, \"that's just what you do here.\"  My wife basically doesn't care either way, but I felt very strongly about it so I had to stand really firm and basically say \"no..we are not doing this. If, as the kids grow up, they become interested in religion and want to go through the process...fine. That is their choice, but they will decide, not us.\"", "NTA  \nI didn't even have to read this. If someone is trying to bully a religion onto a CHILD, they're flat out being territorial and entitled as it is for THEIR comfort, not the child's.\n\nIt's one thing where you grow up around it and go \"oh, this is nice, it makes me feel nice, can i come along?\"  But even just glimpsing this post I can see that's not the case here. They cray cray.", "Very NTA. Religious zealots are a pain in the arse. \n\nBut to play devils advocate, if you're atheist why are you so afraid of christening? As an atheist, a christening is just a benign tradition and 1/16th of a shower.", "You have a chance to get in the inlaws' good graces here, and the baby is only 1 yo. You can turn this into a win/win, and of course, the baby will never know what happened. Obviously, it's a big deal to them, let them have this one, and you'll have one in the bank. Otherwise, it's gonna be super awkward every time you see each other. YTA if you don't allow them their religious ceremony for the newest edition to the family, UNLESS it gonna cost YOU money. If it's free, let em have their fun.", "You would be NTA, but is this really a hill to plant your flag on?  Are you anti religion or just non religion?\n\nIf you don't believe in any of it, where is the harm in letting them drip a teaspoon of water on her head?  She is young enough that she won't remember it and it will have no real effect.  I never saw the value of it myself since the child isn't old enough to consent or accept, but it made my husband's family happy to have our daughter sprinkled.  Then I raised her to think for herself and decide if she wanted a religion.  She chose Buddhism when she was in her 30s, but doesn't do the temple thing.\n\nOf course you have every right to dig in your heels about this especially since the child's mother agrees with you, but you already know it's an epic fight about to happen.
