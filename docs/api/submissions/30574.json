So sometimes i cycle to my class thats about 15 to 20mins away from my apartment. On this specific day it was raining heavily, and my bf decided to pick me up as a kind gesture. I was pretty surprised when i saw him and my reaction showed immediate annoyance. \n\nThe reason for my annoyance is because we have had previous discussions about him not suprising me or just showing up out of nowhere out of the blue. Im not into that with anyone, not parents, friends, and not him, i like to be informced of plans and shit like that. He said he sent a text and that essentially it was my fault for not checking my phone, but i didnt check my phone for 40minutes because firstly, im in a 2 hour lecture hall with shitty wifi, and secondly i was immersed in whatever i was doing. Another reason I got annoyed is because he had no idea if i had plans after my lecture. Its not uncommon for me to wait back with my friends for a while, and after the class id give him a headsup. He just assumed I'd be going straight home after and came and waited for me. Luckily i didnt have plans though, i was just gonna cycle home after.  Lastly, i just really enjoy cycling and i dont mind the rain, i actually find it pretty fun to ride in the rain so he also just took away that opportunity that night and that did contribute to my annoyance.\n\nNow I understand he did that as a kind gesture and out of love, but in reaction to my annoyance/coldness/bitchiness, he then proceeded to get explosively mad and yelled at me (he claims he didnt yell but my ears think differently) , calling me ungrateful and unappreciative. He also later told me he found I was selfish. We had a civil discussion about it the next day, and he essentially stated that he believes i should have put aside my feelings in the moment and shown appreciation instead of annoyance. And told him how i felt in a nice way instead of expresing vexation via my tone and facial expressions. Which I do actually agree with.  He said he does not want a gf who cannot appreciate things like that.  He also apolgized for raising his voice.\n\nAnyways, i understand he made a genuine attempt to be there for me and make me happy by coming to pick me up so i wouldnt have to ride/walk in the rain, he also planned to stay the night by me and do some fun stuff which we ended up not doing because we both got so heated. I also understand i could have been less bitchy or annoyed about him doing something nice. I mostly thought he was wrong for coming without confirming with me first and for raising his voice whilst calling me unappreciative and ungrateful.

I think the best option was to be single after this event. I get not liking surprises but guess what life is full of them whether you like it or not, and that fact that you thought that your bf was trying to stalker doesn't rub well that this relationship is a healthy one. I won't say any of your are the assholes here cause a person who is trying to be nice and help out can't be a asshole especially when he's a bf someone your supposed to trust and love. But neither are you for liking biking in the rain and wanting to do it on your own but I think getting mad at the fact that he wanted to be nice is to over the top and thinking he is being stalkerish cause of it is a way over the top reaction as well.

Everyone is going to have different opinions but none of them are you or him. Props for you both as a couple for talking it out after - having clear communication about our feelings is so important for any healthy relationship (even if it's on the web). I used to be in a very emotionally abusive relationship where my ex would follow me to places to make sure I was doing what I said, meet me without telling me. It all seems nice but it was his way of being in control. Not saying this is what your bf is doing, but he needs to respect your reaction if it was unplanned and you have set a clear boundary from the beginning that you don't like surprises. I also have a hard time dealing with changes in plans because I am in the spectrum. For this, I'm frustrated on your behalf for all the comments on his post saying your behavior was \"sus\". What exactly would you have done in that situation before he came into the picture? You probs would have biked in the rain and been fine. I think he and you should also check the weather that day and make plans accordingly. It's okay to have fights and disagreements - thinking of how he feels - I'm sure it's hard when you want your partner to express excitement and happiness when you think you're doing something nice, and it sounds like you were less than thrilled to see him lol (I understand why) but it sucks when you think you aren't wanted. He was just trying to save the day and in his mind you  pooped on his hero parade. I don't think you're the AH and I don't think he really was either.

You ask first and wait for a reply.\n\nThis isn't rocket science.\n\nBut if your response to being told to *actually* be kind is to go \"Well, whatever, I'll just be an asshole\" then you never were nice or kind in the first place.
