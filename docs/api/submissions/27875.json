Only you can decide if it's enough to go to HR about or not, don't let people on Reddit pressure you.\n\nDo you like your job? Is one guy all it takes to make you so stressed at work? Work is stressful enough without bothering with weirdos who make your day harder. Tell him firmly that you won't answer unless he uses your proper name, or else you'll schedule a meeting with hr. Often, the threat of scheduling the meeting is enough to deter most people. If he insists on just discussing with you, say \"I don't feel comfortable speaking with you about it again without hr present to meditate.\"", "NTA - he is deliberately mispronouncing your name to make a point and its a bad one.  \n\n\nGo to HR and explain what is going on.  Depending on your race and his, this might even be a racist thing on his part.", "There is indeed no reason to be an asshole about it.

Is he insecure about his size? Call him Tiny. That sort of thing. Bet it becomes something he needs to \u201clighten up\u201d about quickly.", "It's not that he can't pronounce it, it's that he refuses to pronounce it correctly.", "She has already corrected him multiple times about it. She doesn't like it. Why should he be allowed to continue to call her by a name she refuses to be acknowledged by? It's like calling her a pet name.

Go to HR.", "You didn't over react you just regular had a \"Please respect me\" conversation then you had the \"Let us be clear I do not like that and am asking you to use my name.\" And he went with, \"I do what I want I don't care.

Is there something else you're comfortable with me calling you?\"\n\nIf there's not, then just tell him you'd prefer he keep trying, and you'll understand if he mispronounces it until he gets it right. In a workplace, we may all have to get along, but we shouldn't go out of our way, like he is, to make someone uncomfortable. You set boundaries, and he should respect those boundaries.", " NTA - go to HR.  He has no right to misname you after repeated efforts to correct the behavior.  I normally wouldn\u2019t advise going to HR, but then he escalated things and called you an asshole.  He is a sexist, racist, asshole.  Does he misname white men too - doubt it.", "NTA but if he finds the name hard to pronounce you can tell him a name or nickname that you would be more comfortable with because I also struggle with people calling my name inappropriately it cringes me so I just tell them a name that would be easier.", "NTA. Questions: are you Black or otherwise a POC? Is Aaron a different race from you? It seems like race is very likely to be an element here, which means you should DEFINITELY be going to HR over this. And if there are any negative consequences for you speaking to HR about being discriminated against, then an employment lawyer would certainly be very willing to help you out-- so any wise HR will understand this and step in on your behalf.", "NTA\n\nReport to HR.\n\nYou are going to find people will try to force names on you, and even get others on it too if you allow it.\n\nIt's the same reason trans folks have to keep on top of things in case someone finds out their dead name.\n\nPersonally, yours might be racially motivated.  Many folks where I live have names that are hard to pronounce - but it's only the white folks who seem to not want to at least try (I'm white...so I often have to call it out).\n\nI get it if he was a child.\n\nHe's not a child.", "NTA\nIt's a big deal to you and it's your name.. Nobody gets to tell you that they can't be bothered to say your name properly and you just have to suck it up.  He's wrong.", "NTA. I have a name that has a pretty common nickname. I. Hate. That. Nickname. I will dead stop the first time you drop it and nicely tell you that I do not go by that and will move on.

One, go to HR, it is not cool to call someone something they do not want to be called. Thats the high road. Two, Start calling him Ron, or Ronnie or Rhoney or just air. See how he likes it.", "NTA. Start calling him A-A-RON over the radio.", "NTA. The bar is on the floor here as far as human behavior goes. Calling someone by her name is basic manners. Your coworker is lazy and rude. He doesn't get to decide it's not a big deal. Definitely go to HR over this; calling someone an AH for asking you to call them the correct name is way over the line.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally I would choose \"Ron\" as the nickname to start calling him. Close but satisfyingly wrong.", "It\u2019s definitely racist.", "My name is really common my with a unique spelling so I get people stumbling over saying it if they don't know me (school rosters that sort of thing).  It would really bother me if someone continued to say my name wrong even after I had corrected them.  Definitely NTA and absolutely escalate this if he persists even after you have asked him to stop.", "Thank you for the compliment on my name. I've always liked it myself.", "I honestly think that he just doesn't want to he can pronounce Saisha correctly, literally the rest of my name you just add Da' in front of it.", "Could use Key & Peele's \"Ay-ay-ron\"", "Yes. I suggest Noraa.", "\ud83e\udd23", "Yes I understand but some people are just really really ignorant when it comes to names that they are not accustomed with and they would want to call it the way they are comfortable with not minding if you\u2019re okay with it. But you know just to avoid drama with this person since you wouldn\u2019t have a choice than to see him everyday at work. Don\u2019t let him call you Sasha cos that\u2019s not your name and others would want to do that. If you have other names you\u2019re comfortable with you can tell him and if he just wants to be and AH just report him to HR.", "Haha you beat me to it!"]}
