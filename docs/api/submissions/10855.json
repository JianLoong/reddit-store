{"id": 10855, "submission_id": "11bczfi", "title": "AITA for ditching my friend because I was hungry", "selftext": "Throwaway and new to reddit.\n\nI (f23) planned a fun day with my friend (f23) to go to a museum, do some activities, and grab a late lunch after. In the morning my friend told me last minute that she actually wanted to go to the museum earlier than planned and was headed over to my place but that I could still get ready leisurely. I honestly was a bit pissed since it was 8am and we planned to go to the museum at 11am but it wasn't uncommon for her to hang out at mine when she could since she had a falling out with her roommate. She arrived and I got ready but I started feeling a bit rushed so I just made a cup of coffee and skipped breakfast. This point because important later. She drove us and we went about our day from 9-3 and it was truly lots of fun. Now came the time for the late lunch/dinner.\n\n I was STARVING and since she drove I offered to pay for the meal wherever we went. She agreed and started saying she didn't know what she wanted so she wanted me to pick. Since we were headed back to my apartment and there was a chick-fil-a near, I suggested it. She immediately blew up saying she would never give them her business because they are homophobic. I was a bit shocked she seemed mad at me but I know a lot of people don't like that place so whatever. I mentioned this italian restaurant popular in the area and she said no because they bought out a family owned business that used to be there. I was starting to get hungry listening to her ranting about these things but I pressed on. I mentioned Texas roadhouse and she said no because they are homophobic and racist. I started getting desperate and at this point we were parked in parking lot on the main road of our town. I told her I was hungry and to just pick something and then she told me I shouldn't have skipped breakfast and could have woken up earlier to make it before she got to mine. I was suddenly furious but just ignored it and started listing out everything in the town which she had something to say about. Finally I told her I was just hungry and needed her to pick because I was starting to get a bit upset. She told me I needed to be more aware about how these food places have impacted people in places outside our town. She told me I needed to be more of an activist.\n\nThis is where I think I might be the AH. I snapped at her and told her I was so hungry that I couldn't give less fucks right now about what is or isn't a cancelled food place. I feel like I should have stopped there but then I told her she wasn't a \"good activist\" because her car isn't electric, she buys from shein, and is the president of the hispanic club despite being white and not knowing spanish. She looked taken aback and asked me if I said that because I am hispanic. For some reason I just doubled over laughing and said I was fucking hungry and got out the car. I walked home and picked up food on the way. Afterwards she texted me calling me an insensitive bitch and I just ignored it. Am I the asshole for arguing with her and leaving?", "created_utc": 1677302725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bczfi/aita_for_ditching_my_friend_because_i_was_hungry/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dude... NTA you may even be my hero right now. To be a fly on the wall when you made that Spanish club statement \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \n\nShe's the one that changed the time/plans..  she doesn't get to act all high and mighty about you skipping breakfast because you had to adjust to HER changing the plans.", "NTA. She shows up early, rushes you, and refuses to either agree on or pick a place to eat. and then name calls you when you finally get out the car and get it yourself? Also you\u2019re right, she sounds like she is literally the peak image of performative activism.", "NTA make new friends...", "NTA. While it\u2019s hard to be 100% in support of things due to how the world works, she sounds like a hypocrite. You can\u2019t deny someone food. While I don\u2019t agree with the \u201cI\u2019m not me when I\u2019m hungry\u201d argument, it\u2019s unhealthy to not eat. If you have health conditions, that can be bad. Her knowing you\u2019re starving and disagreeing with every option while not suggesting any and then getting mad at you for their bad planning-\nthey sound like a selfish entitled hypocrite", "NTA. You can't ask someone else to choose a place to eat and then shut down every single request they make. That is just ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThis whole situation is just a mess.\n\nFirst and foremost, I too, would be pissed if we had plans for 11 and you show up at 8am. If there isn\u2019t info missing, this wasn\u2019t even an ask. It was as simple as \u2018I want to go earlier, I\u2019m on my way, I\u2019ll hangout while you get ready.\u2019 So if it was me, I wouldn\u2019t be feeling rushed. I wouldn\u2019t skip out on breakfast. I\u2019d really take my time. If she got pissed, that\u2019s on her for changing up the plans.\n\nSecondly, I hate the whole \u201cyou pick\u201d food situation. People always say this because they don\u2019t know what they want, but the minute you start firing suggestions they have an issue with every single one. And in this moment when she knows you haven\u2019t ate, knows you\u2019re starving, knows it\u2019s 3pm - I wouldn\u2019t of giving a detailed explanation of why I refuse to eat at each place. Do I think you snapped? Yes. Do I think you\u2019re an AH for your response? Not really, because it\u2019s kind of true. Not necessary, but unfortunately shit comes out when you\u2019re hangry and heated. \n\nI would\u2019ve done the same but been like \u2018okay, I\u2019m really going to need your input because I\u2019ve fired a few suggestions and you\u2019ve said no to them all.\u2019 At that rate, if you don\u2019t know, or are going to argue with me - I\u2019ll just get food for myself. If she\u2019s hungry and wanting to eat too, she should offer some input.", "NTA- just cause you like chicken sandwiches doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re homophobic \ud83d\ude02", "I can\u2019t imagine why her room mate doesn\u2019t like her. She sounds insufferable. She shows up hours early and then blames you for not psychically knowing to wake up early and be ready to greet her august presence? And I\u2019ll bet you hurried because she made it clear she was unhappy about having to wait on you. NTA", "I find the fact your friend is white and president of the hispanic club hilarious lol \n\nIs she mixed at least? I'm just asking since I am of hispanic descent but I have paler skin due to Spanish in my family. \n\nAnyways your so NT*\n\nFrankly your friend sounds very privileged and frankly should stop running her mouth and forcing her beliefs on others. What gets me on these \"woke\" people is how they want everyone to bend to their beliefs but refuse to let other people be entitled to theirs despite claiming that everyone should have the freedom of choice.\n\nI would drop that friend for good OP", "My my my how the turn tables. NTA and ty for the laugh", "NTA. She sounds insufferable, hypocritical and selfish. It\u2019s exhausting to be around constantly angry people that hate everything, but if she has a problem with every company then she should have made a suggestion that wasn\u2019t offensive to her. And while your comments about her not being a good activist may not be completely nice, they are also true (and funny). Find some less annoying friends and leave her to her Spanish club.", "Light ESH. Your friend sucks for changing the plan last minute and then for being picky about where you should eat instead of picking a place because she knew you were hungry.\n\nOP sucks cuz you blew up at your friend.

It wasn't enough to show up uninvited HOURS before your scheduled hang (what if you were sleeping? having someone over? playing daily morning naked flute?), she also needed to berate you for not starting your day EARLIER and refused all your offers for places to eat - despite the fact that YOU were paying and her precious dollars weren't being spent anywhere???\n\nYou *do* need to be more of an advocate - for yourself! Screw this \"friend\", you were nice and overly accommodating until it was literally impossible and hopefully you won't give her the time of day again. NTA", "ESA,\n\nI appreciate her being an activist for the LGBT+++ but then she needs to pick a place to eat herself.\n\nYou blew up at her, but no one can be the perfect activist if we don't live on our island that no one inhabited, and has no indigenous life (plant or animal). After a while you should never have existed.", "You have learned the hard way to never skip breakfast.\n\nNTA", "NTA Your \"friend\" sound straining. And her logic is so flawned. The owner or chain bosses may did something bad like buying out a family restaurant but they give people work. If everybody would stop eating there like she wants, so many would be unemployed. And if you look at every place, food industry, retail, whatever... everything has some flaws. No place is perfect!", "NTA she sounds fucking exhausting. I would troll her so much if I knew her.", "NTA I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t insist on \u2018latinx\u2019", "This is honestly what had me a bit shocked because she would always tell me to eat proper meals because I have a habit of eating cough drops for lunch and dinner after classes when I forget to cook lol so when we planned this \"self care\" day I was looking forward to a nice meal with my friend after our activities", "She has a habit of showing up earlier than planned or staying later at mine because she knows I will block out an entire day if I make plans so that I don't have to worry about doing schoolwork. I was shocked at her coming so early, but we had gotten ready together before so I thought this would be one of those times. Unfortunately, she pulled up completely dressed and ready to go so internally I rushed since I felt bad having her wait for me even though she said she didn't mind. I totally love the idea of me just going back to sleep while she's in my living room waiting lol\n\nAlso, yeah I feel bad about snapping because I typically have a relaxed, \"don't care\" personality and a killer poker face so I don't think she could visually see that I was getting more and more upset. On the other hand, I did repeatedly tell her I was starting to get upset because of how hungry I was. Thanks for your input, I probably should have told her that I was at the point I would rather get food alone than bicker in the car.", "It's sad that you can't just enjoy food anymore without politics getting in the way", "No she isn't lol. I think she got the position because she is good at organizing club events and maybe nobody else who was hispanic wanted it. I am not in the club because I don't have time for it and honestly I was never even upset she got the position- I just thought it was funny lol.", "This!!", "Lol I found it hilarious. Sounds like something from a movie, to be honest when I read that part I envisioned your friend acting like Cher from the movie Clueless when she insulted her housekeeper over speaking Spanish lol", "NTA, I can see why she had a falling out with her room mate. She sounds exhausting to deal with. I would reconsider keeping her as a friend if she continues to be like this. This is the reddit way.", "Nope one is saying liking chicken sandwiches makes you homophobic (but we all know how irresistible a good strawman argument can be) but the CEO Dan Cathy uses his wealth (which he has accumulated because of Chick Fil A) to lobby against, for example, the Equality Act.", "Honestly I'd stop having her over to your house and meet in public places or other people's houses.  Showing up at 8am when pland aren't till 11 and then rushing you is incredibly rude.  She takes advantage of you being generous with your time and it's time to set up boundaries"]}
