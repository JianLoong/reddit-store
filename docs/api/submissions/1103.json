They don't understand. \n\nYou were deprived of cake growing up. You didn't get one last year. \n\nIt's basically a form of trauma response. For whatever reason, you were denied something that our society deems a significant part of the birthday celebration, whether due to neglect or poverty. Either one affects the psyche, and worse if it's both. So, when you missed out on having a cake last year, it triggered that trauma response. \n\nThe result? You\u2019re trying to make up for it with two cakes this year. One super expensive and indulgent, and one that can be had fairly cheap. It's the \"do over\" urge. \n\nI will tell you from experience that having both cakes may not cheer you in the way you expect. My attempt at a wedding redo sure af didn't help me and I'm still resentful.

Got delayed because of covid you know.\n\nBut really, your husband sounds toxic... It's obvious WHY you want two cakes. You are overcompensating from your childhood. Through not getting a cake because your mither FORGOT, you felt less loved. You identified having a cake on your bday as being loved, it being a proof of love. There would be a lot to unpack in therapy i believe, and i do think you should see a therapist because it does seem you have felt abandoned and neglected and it would really help you put all that to rest, but really, wanting two cakes is nothing!! \n\nAnd you won't \"eat them all\"??! Ooooh boy, give me a fork, let's see about that!\n\nNTA but your husband... I find it really sad that he could just do a little thing to make you really happy, and instead he'd rather fight and have you sad. Have you asked him why HE felt so hardly about not having two cakes? I mean, if the person i love tells me she'd be so happy having two cakes on her bday, and i only have to pay for one, then i would buy it!!

There is absolutely no need to make a big fuss about it.", "YTA for not being satisfied with the Cheesecake Factory cake. If your husband asked for 7 cakes for his birthday, would you try to explain that this is excessive? \nLet\u2019s compromise. Cookie cake for Thanksgiving. Linda\u2019s fudge cake from Cheesecake Factory for birthday. Are you really going to be sad if you only have a single cake? You were deprived of cakes as a child, and now if you have one, you feel deprived again? When you dig into that fudge cake, you\u2019re going to be eating that and wishing you had something sweet for dessert like a cake ? \n\nI look at it this way. If my daughter wanted two cakes,I would ask which she wants the most, and that is the one she would get.

Your husband sucks for telling you what to do and for dying on this hill. But you suck for putting him in this position.

You are supposed to be grateful for whatever people are willing to give you on your birthday, but you are not entitled to those things. It's okay to tell your husband what you prefer ahead of time in order to give him a chance to fulfill your dreams. But the fact that he was so resistant to this makes me wonder if you are demanding in other aspect of your life. I honestly wonder if he is setting boundaries now because you've been pushing them for a while.\n\nIf you want two cakes, you can buy two cakes.
