First things first, sorry about your mom OP. It's a complicated thing to go through, and everyone handles it differently at any age. Even if it happens young and you barely remember it can come back around and rear it's ugly head.\n\nBut really.. What did they expect to happen forcing a bond onto a child? And against the childs wishes? I'd understand perhaps if your dad was truly ill and worried something might happen, but even then was she really the best/only option? Sounds like she's not.\n\nMind if I ask how old you were when she passed? And how long was it between your mom's passing and your \"forcible adoption\"?\n\nEdit: Timeline much too short. OP's dad decided his wife was a good match for him, then rushed the marriage and adoption far too quickly without considering OP. Dad's TA for sure.", "NTA.  You objected to the adoption. They ignored you. You've now undone the damage that they did. Props to you and to your Nan.", "NTA. Your Dad and his wife sound manipulative af.", "NTA. Why should you protect their feelings? They didn't do anything to protect yours.\n\nI think you should check in with your grandparents though; if your post has caused issues for them, you need to support them.", "NTA. When will people learn you can't force family. <Love and Respect> A piece of paper with a name change. Didn't make the woman a mother.", "NTA\n\nPetty, sure, but you did not want to be adopted by your stepmother and immediately went No Contact when you turned 18, so that's a pretty massive indicator of the type of people they were\n\nmore Info wouldn't hurt though", "NTA\n\nBut ... I think the other posts saying Y T A or  E S H are due to people reading this passage differently than I am\n\n>And then around midnight last night I made a Facebook **post thanking my grandma for adopting me and being a great mom** to me. I don't even celebrate the UKs Mother's Day but dad's parents reminded me about it and said I should post something **knowing she would see**. \n\nThe way this is phrased is a little confusing. I read it as \"knowing grandma would see and be happy\" and I believe others are reading \"knowing stepmother would see and be hurt\".\n\nI think dad/stepmom are AHs either way, and what they did was abusive (and illegal) so no matter how they were after that, I don't think you're an AH for not caring about their feelings about this. They didn't care about yours, forcing an adoption when you barely knew her! \n\nIf other people are reading the statement right, you're still NTA... but I think that's why some people think you might be.", "NTA\n\nAs far as it goes, you corrected a mistake that never should have been made.", "Nta!!", "NTA", "NTA, though you are petty. Good for you for going NC and taking your power back with the grandparents adoption. I hope you find peace one day so you don\u2019t continue to lash out at them.

Two years later dad's new wife can't have kids so they force an adoption AND lied to a judge to get it granted (which uh hello is a criminal offense). That in it's self is abuse. The real question is did they ever receive counselling for all this, especially for the death of a parent? \nOPs Dad is TA just because he put his new wife's feelings over his SON'S. at 18 now op made a massive aggressive post on FB. Oh well shouldnt have FORCEFULLY adopted him. She's hurt? Oh okay cause OP WASNT hurt for the last few years. \n\nKay rant over haha", "NTA OP, I\u2019m sorry your dad put you through all of that.

You asked about ruining mother's day, but that's not what you really did, according to your own writing.   \n\n\nUsing your maternal grandparents love for you as a weapon to hurt your Dad and step mother, that's the AH move. Using love as an object to push in someone else's face will never be a good thing.   \n\n\nBasically, you disrespected your grandparents as well as your father and step mother.   \n\n\nGoing behind your parent's backs and got an adult-adoption doesn't not make you any kind of AH. It's your life and a reasonable response to never wanting to be adopted as a child. But as an adult, you should be able to hold multiple factors in mind when making decisions.   \n\n\nMaking everything about getting back at your parent, no matter who you hurt, that's an AH move.   \n\n\nI have to agree with some of the other commenters though, there's got to be more to this story.", "NTA. It\u2019s a little bit petty to post about just for them to see, but honestly they deserve it.

There's nothing describing why, and it appears that you crafted this FB post with the intention of hurting her.\n\nGive us a reason to get on your side.

OP had a mom, dead or not, they still had one they obviously loved very much.  That is all that should really matter.

To have my mother's name ripped from my birth certificate and a random woman (because that is all she ever was to me) put on there. They even lied to get the adoption put through and never ever stopped to think about what that did to me. I never loved this woman and I hated my dad for doing it to me as well.
