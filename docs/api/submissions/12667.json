I\u2019ve lived in both the Uk and the US so I know a fair amount of expats and most people choose one, or celebrate their mothers on one and themselves on the other. I don\u2019t know anyone who seriously does both, maybe in a joking way. Similarly my mother lives in a foreign country now and I might wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day if I get a notice somewhere that it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day there but otherwise I don\u2019t think about it/her on that day and she doesn\u2019t care."]}
