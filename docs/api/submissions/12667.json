NTA.\n\nStep-parents, regardless of their circumstances, need to think about what the child wants as much as what they think is in their best interests. If a child is literally begging you to not do something that you are only really motivated by personal want to do, than maybe consider this isn't a \"better interests\" case and more a, \"I'm satiating my own ego\" case. Though that's hardly a surprise by a step-mom who celebrates **both** mothers days. I mean...really, there's no need for that.\n\nAll in all, you haven't spoken to them since you turned 18 half a year ago, they had to know that was coming, and they were not entitled to know that your step-mother was officially demoted. They weren't going to receive a hand out of love on a day they clearly didn't earn as it is. Especially given how apparently they spent those 11 years berating you for not magically getting along with their new status quo.\n\nHonestly, the dark hooded version of me wishes to remind you that the words \"finally a complete family\" with a picture of you and your grandparents or maternal family might be a good FB post for US Mothers day.", "NTA.

They did something you did not like, but they did not mistreat you. You have held on to an angry grudge since you were seven years old. What your parents should have done was put you in therapy.

Obviously you were not that close to your father's wife. You even went NC for several months. They should have gotten the clue from that. I believe that you can have your birth record changed (now that you are at the age of majority) to have your biological mother's name back on it.\n\nP.S. I am so very sorry for the loss of your mother at such a young and sensitive age. I lost my father when I was eight. I truly feel for you.", "So a 6 year old can shoot a teacher with no repercussions, and a 7 year old can hold a grudge for legal guardianship and treat that woman who raised them like shit. \n\nAnd the parents are once again the aH\n\nnope\n\nYTA"]}
