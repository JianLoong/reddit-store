Some new moms end up experiencing a change in their social lives. Like, childless friends no longer wanting to hang out with them, or people coming over and only focusing on what the baby needs and not what the mom needs too, or just not being able to go out and be social with other adults. (My brother was a stay at home dad for a while and had an issue with this until he just got recently got a job he really enjoys and now he gets to spend the day with adults again instead of toddlers being his only source of socialization.)\n\nSo just keep that in mind whenever your sister asks you to go out with her again.

She may need to know you\u2019re there for her mentally and emotionally too and are someone she can spend time with and talk to like an adult too.", "NTA you agreed to help with chores, you are.

Sister isn\u2019t an asshole because she\u2019s just trying to feel human and like herself, but her expectations aren\u2019t really realistic. Nobody can be expected to go out with you every single day even if you are postpartum. Talk to her gently and explain. Encourage her to reach out to friends. Help her find a play group or another way for her to get out with other people. There doesn\u2019t need to be animus and a breakdown of relationship here.", "Why does it have to be all or nothing though? I'm doing what I'm capable of doing but because it's not enough I should just go home and leave her alone altogether?", "Counterpoint: don't ask people for help they can't give and then get mad about it. Much like nobody asks a broke single mom for money to pay their rent, most people wouldn't ask a depressed person to be social support. It's demanding water from an empty well.\n\nIf sister doesn't want help with cooking, cleaning, and watching the baby she's free to send OP home.", "I thought the same thing. Going to the park, getting outside for simple, small trips, is good for everyone's health (mom, baby, and probably OP as well). If mom was wanting to go on elaborate trips somewhere, which is what the post sounded like at first, I would 100% be on OP's side.\n\nBut just going to the park to hang out for an hour? That sounds like a reasonable request for someone with a one month old. It's not good to stay cooped up constantly, fresh air will be good for the baby. And if OP is on hand to help mom, I can see how mom would want to take advantage of having the extra set of hands and eyes for a park trip. This is a normal and healthy activity, which makes me lean YTA.", "Thank you, it's enlightening to understand her side in detail like this. I have a question, if someone was staying home with you, watching tv/dramas with you and discussing it, interacting with them throughout the day for little things, would it be enough interacting for you or would you need more?

Your sleep is disturbed your work schedule is upended, and you're doing that out of the kindness of your heart because you care about her.\n\nIt's okay if you don't want to go out with her, but I think there may also be a little bit of dependency going on here with her, she's capable of carrying a stroller or a baby bag but you're doing it all and watching the kid? It sounds like you started doing it at first because she was fresh out of the birth but she's never taken the jobs on since then. If you want to stay and work it out you may want to try delegating more jobs back to her slowly. Starting with the jobs surrounding trips out. She needs to organise the transport and the stroller and the baby supplies and you need to let her fail if she forgets something or doesn't plan out what she needs well enough. If you keep doing it she'll get used to it.\n\nIf you are able to hand over more of these jobs to her then that may make you more amenable to going out with her and you could even offer that as a suggestion and say you'll go out with her x times a week provided she's responsible for the arrangements and takes on more of the work. It's unfair to expect you to essential act as a parent to this kid and also a cook and cleaner and then accuse you of not caring.\n\nI think she's making it clear what support she needs now so you need to start dropping some of the other jobs back to her like the cleaning or cooking for everyone.

Being a mom is hard, she was the one who gave birth and has to feed the baby if she\u2019s not using formula, but that\u2019s not an excuse to diminish what you\u2019re doing for her when it\u2019s not even your responsibility.", "NTA You're helping in the ways you can without completely breaking yourself for your sister.

I think it's interesting that your sister isn't taking you up on your offer to stay home with the baby while she socializes. She might be depressed from not socializing. Staying in the house might be unhealthy for her, but not for you.

You do all the normal and helpful things to help your sister around the house. In fact, you do so much that you are essentially the second parent and are exhausted as a parent would be. If you are an introvert who doesn't gain energy from going out, *it is completely fine to take some time to be alone*. The fact that you are willing to look after the baby while your sister goes out shows that this isn't about your sister's desperate need to go out and be around other people, but instead about controlling you and the ways you need to decompress. Where is your sister's partner in all this?? Why do you have to supply every single need your sister has?\n\nAnd frankly, more to the point, why is your sister so desperate to bring a baby on the metro or crowded areas when it sounds like the baby is a newborn?? Ignoring covid (though obviously this is a huge one), there's still a terrible flu and RSV and all sorts of things out there that a newborn can't fight and it sounds like it's too soon to vaccinate the baby to make such activities safe. If the baby is old enough to be vaccinated, I would say that you have spent more than enough time helping an ungrateful sister and should go back to dealing with your own health crisis. Your sister is selfish and lacks understanding or empathy if she thinks that you being unwilling to go out with a baby in tow is you \"not supporting\" her, particularly when you have offered a juice compromise.

It sounds like you are doing a lot to help with the household, cleaning, and the baby. It also makes sense that she needs to get out of the house. But I don't understand why it HAS to be with you? You are already helping so much. There are so many places/events/groups etc, that help with socializing for new moms. Or another option....what about your sister going out with her husband when he is home?\n\nEvery new mom is different, so I can't pretend to know what she is going through at 6 weeks post partum, but only have my experience to lean on for context. I had twins. I didn't want someone staying with me after birth, I would be anxious about feeling like having to entertain even the most close person. I also wanted to learn how to take care of the twins by myself. I walked my oldest to school and back with the twins in their stroller when they were a month old (like 8 blocks roundtrip). That was too much lol. But I learned from it. And so I took them out for short trips like once a day just to get out. I learned so much doing that, about what I needed for the stroller, diaper bag, how to feed them in different places/situations....and all that built my confidence up as a new mom. So I wonder if you can frame it that way with her if/when you talk? You can help relieve chores/work at home for her, and her outings can be a way for her to learn how to do it with a baby by herself and so she knows she can be her extroverted self when she doesnt have another person with?", "NAH - I think you and your sister are just different people with different needs. She just had a baby and is probably struggling with not having as much freedom to do things as she used to. She might need to get out of the house and be around other people.\n\nYou on the other hand are burnt out and need rest. It is a lot on you to go out and you are already doing what you can to help with the baby and the house.\n\nI wonder if a compromise could be made where you do something social, but at the house. Maybe a paint night, or movie night or board games. It would give you both time to connect, but in a less overwhelming way.\n\nSounds like your sister wants to connect with, but had a bad way of saying it. And I am so sorry you are burnt out.

Your social needs and her social needs are both independently valid! She is frustrated that your social needs are not aligning with hers because she would like your help and company while achieving her social needs, and likely sees your refusals as an opposition to her social needs instead of what it really is, a protection of your social needs. It's a simple incompatibility that's causing some hurt feelings in a stressful time. \n\n\nThe two of you just need to sit down and have a really good heart to heart. \n\n\nSometimes my sister and I need to have a good scream at each other, a couple of drinks, and then we find our way back to each other.

Kudos to them because when my depression was at its worse, I couldn\u2019t get myself out of bed, but they\u2019re at least helping their sister out around the house. They even offered to watch the baby if sister wanted to go out, so sis could\u2019ve reached out to friends they haven\u2019t seen in a while or something.

Your sister is using the hell out of you and she\u2019s trying to guilt trip you into doing literally everything for her while she continues to pretend she\u2019s not a mom now. She needs to get on her own two feet and realize that if she was doing everything you were doing she\u2019d be burnt out too.

Most people have a lot to say on what you should be doing when half of them have never had a baby nor helped with a baby. I suppose if your sister wants your help doing chores, helping with baby, being her counselor, going out for hours of the day, giving massages, and anything else on a whim you should do it just because you offered help in the first place. That\u2019s not how help works. You\u2019re not a workhorse and you don\u2019t suddenly forget your own mental health just because she has had a baby.

But.  Consider the walk to the park (as long as it doesn\u2019t include a metro ride).

So I think you can do better.  Especially as it means a lot to your sister.", "NTA - you\u2019ve gone above and beyond what is be expected of you as an auntie/sister.

It is really important to adjust a baby to society/get used to doing things outside the house with a baby. OPs sister doesn\u2019t necessarily need OP to do these things, but it probably is a lot more stressful for sister to have OP providing such a negative outlook on her new normal. It may suck for OP to think about all the stuff that will potentially happen while out with a newborn, but that\u2019s not OPs normal. It\u2019s sisters normal and to have someone who locked themselves in their room so they don\u2019t have to participate, shouldn\u2019t be in the house in the first place IMO. \n\nSo yes, OP, YTA", "This, this needs to be higher.

While SIL gave me, OP is the mom instead or more like the unpaid maid.", "Hijacking the top-voted comment for visibility because while OP is certainly NTA, I'm worried based on the last two paragraphs that OP's sister is potentially showing signs/symptoms of postpartum depression and it might be a very good idea to gently broach the topic with OP's sister and see if she'd be willing to call her OB or primary care doctor for screening and, if necessary, a referral to someone that can help her find relief. It sounds like she's feeling lonely, perhaps isolated, she says she's depressed, and she feels like no one cares about her. This likely has little to do with OP or going on outings, and a lot to do with hormones and brain chemistry and might get significantly worse without diagnosis and treatment if it is indeed postpartum depression. OP, would you be willing to talk to your sister about these feelings and offer to accompany her to a doctor's appointment to see if they might be able to help your sister find relief?", "I agree.

If the sister has completely different needs than OP had thought the sister would have, they need to speak to each other to find out if this arrangement is okay with both of them.", "It sounded like she was hiding in her room and her sister was taking the baby with her when she went out. I looked for the comment where OP is watching the baby then and couldn't find it.\n\nEdit: It does sound like OP is helping out a lot though.

My ex spouse didn\u2019t even do all that and he was a -parent- to my baby. OP does need to go home, not because they\u2019re being self-centered but because sister is being incredibly ungrateful for the amount of help she\u2019s getting right now.", "Excuse me? Get over herself? \nShe has been working the lion share of the work. What about OP\u2019s mental health? Is she not a human being that needs help herself? She is fighting of working through a depression disorder and has now been burnt out. \nPost partum is very hard on a lot of woman but so is depression and being burnt out.\nShe is taking care of the baby even when the parents are both home.  During day time. During the nights. She cooks and cleans and works as a freelancer. \nOP works damn hard I\u2019d say. \nJust like everyone OP needs a break. \nEveryone has needs and wants and OP\u2019s are not less then her sisters just because she didn\u2019t give birth. \nShe has helped the sister plenty of times already. \nShe was the unpaid nanny and maid and is expected to go out and push the stroller? \nJust because the sister is a new mom doesn\u2019t mean Op needs to jump at her every request. \nThe sister can call up someone else to go out and let OP have a break.\nShe has done more than enough to help. She should just go home and work on herself.", "I bet the sister will change her tune when her servant leaves and she has to do all the cleaning, childcare, nighttime feedings, doctors visits and all the other social outings the sister did attend with her.

During the day, we can both be in the house and I'd be the one changing him up sometimes. When she's out I watch him.

Seriously people are being fucking heartless here...", "Honestly, it's part of why I think you should be required to make your own comment before you can read other comments on AITA.  Too much groupthink, and too many people respond to the top comment's spin on things, even if it's directly contradicted by the actual submission.", "Is that really ironic?

Sister needs something that she thought OP could provide, but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault that she can\u2019t provide it.

Her insistence on you leaving the house and socializing may sound helpful to an extrovert, but for an introvert like me would just use up all the mental energy I had.", "OP please stop listening to the Y T As. It sounds like you're helping your sister with SO MANY things, like chores and a lot of childcare. Even night feedings. You're an incredible help. I don't know how you're managing that with depression, kudos to you.\n\nI don't like these people saying that you basically have to bend over for everything your sister wants. Those entitled people who think that just because you popped out a kid the world revolves around you, and your will is everyone's command, disgust me to my very core. Your sister can do the stuff you've been doing for her all this time, and then let's see if it wasn't enough that you're cleaning her house and feeding her kid at night while she's getting her beauty sleep. NTA imo.\n\nEta : I am not saying sister doesn't need human interaction or that she should stay inside every day. OP offered to watch the kid while sister goes out. She must have friends, she can go out with someone else than OP.", "Honey, her needs are no more important than yours. You are helping, despite what many of these entitled, ungrateful commenters, and your sister, say. If your sister isn\u2019t happy with your command performance, then I would just go home and seek my own mental health treatment, and let her take care of her own situation. I certainly didn\u2019t have anywhere near the level of help your sister has for my babies, and by six weeks I was functioning very well on my own during the day. Your sister certainly doesn\u2019t seem to care very much about your mental health, so I say it\u2019s time to go home and let her deal with her own situation in her own way.", "That's fine, OP. Sometimes people's needs don't match up. I've abstained from passing judgement, but I don't think Y T A in any way, just that you sound tired and aren't able to give your sister the things she's asking for. You've helped plenty, take some/lots of time for yourself.", "Are you an introvert? That might be part of the issue, too.", "First of all, I'm very sorry you're going through that and kudos to you for doing what you have been doing for your sister. \n\nPlease be aware as a new mom though, your sister is also at risk for postpartum depression and going out and socializing OUTSIDE of the house is a major help in combating that. I'm voting NAH, I think you both just have different needs right now.", "I won\u2019t call you an AH but I think you need to also look at it another way. You decided to go to your sister and help her with her baby. You absolutely are not obligated to do this and could have declined the request. With staying at someone else\u2019s house means the space is not yours and you will need to do some things that maybe you don\u2019t want to do. \n\nI think you need to find a balance that works for both of you. If you keep declining she is going to get upset and if you say yes to everything you will get burned out. Going to the park is reasonable spend an hour or two out in the sunshine. Go home and spend 30 minutes in your room to decompress. \n\nYou have to speak to your sister and explain what you are feeling. She may not know you are depressed. Good luck to you both.", "Word count no longer applie to edits, so you should really add this info. It may change quite a few verdicts.", "In that case NTA for sure. Good for you! You\u2019re  contributing a lot for someone struggling with depression. But\u2026\n\nPlease, OP, consider dragging yourself out with your sister half the time. For your own good, not just hers. Even meager winter sun and a change of scenery can improve your mood. Look it it like medicine, and it\u2019s medicine you\u2019re taking for both you and your sister. \n\nTake care of yourself. You\u2019re  doing great, keep at it", "I would put this in your main post as an edit! The post reads that you came to help but aren't doing anything your sister wants. \nIt seems what really is happening is that you are helping around the house with chores, and you are giving her breaks by watching the baby when she needs you to. \nNAH , as a new mother she needs time out of the house for her mental health. And she needs human interaction to keep her sanity. You are helping as much as you can in the ways you can.\nI would encourage her to set up hangouts with friends and she can either take the baby or leave baby with you.  That way she gets rhe interactions she craves and you don't have to deal with the extra stress. Just let her know you are an introvert and she is an extrovert. And it takes way too much energy for you to be going out every day, but you want to help in all the other ways. Maybe compromise and offer to go to the park once a week with her?", "You should addd this to the post.  \n\nAs per my other comment - I still think you should go to the park. Even if it's just alone. At minimum make sure you take a walk outside at least 4 times a week, if not every day.\n\nHowever I also think expecting you to go into the city is too much and you're doing enough.", "It is SUCH a brain break. You\u2019re so right about how it frees your brain from house-related work, survival-related work, all the \u2018work\u2019 that keeps your brain busy and unable to relax when you\u2019re within the walls of home.", "She's not there as a nanny. She's there as a sister. A nanny wouldn't have the same responsibility as worrying about her sister's feelings as op should have. A nanny would be there solely to take care of the baby", "\"Addressing their behaviors\" like not having depression anymore so they can be their sister's perky unpaid nanny when she goes out? 'K.\n\n*Nobody* should have to compromise for mental health including OP. For their own mental health they can go home and sister can find someone else to do all her housework, cook, and take care of the baby including at night. There, no compromise required.", "So OP\u2019s options are to either cave to her sisters every demand because \u201csister should not have to compromise right now. This time should be about what is best for her and the baby\u201d or she needs to leave her sister high and dry without any help\u2014because that is what happens generally to people who make \u201call or nothing\u201d demands of others. \n\nIt is not OP\u2019s baby, and OP did not participate in its creation. Sister can either understand that OP is already taking on a huge amount of responsibility THAT IS NOT HERS or she can choose to have no help at all and see how her mental health fares when she has no time to leave the house AT ALL, even alone (which she would be begging for at that point), because she is now swamped under the same work every other family without external daily live in help has.\n\nEvery day here we see new posts about new moms not getting help. OP is helping sister with everything within her capacity. If that isn\u2019t enough, sister is more than welcome to do this sans regular external support the way most parents have to.\n\nIf sister thinks having OP leave is going to make things better, sister is delusional. Forcing company on outings at the potential expense of losing the person helping with nighttime crying/feeding, cooking, cleaning is very short sighted.", "OP is not responsible for her sister's Post-Partum Depression.   \n\n\nI know that sounds harsh, but at the end of the day it's not fair for her sister to put that on her.   \n\n\nMy wife had really bad ppd with all three kids and it's a monster, absolutely, but if the sis is struggling that badly with it she needs to seek professional help, not lay that on OP, who is already doing so much to help out.", "Popping out a kid doesn't give you the right to be a brat and demand people put their own mental health on hold. OP is doing the housework, watching the baby and even getting up at night to feed and change it when the parents either dont hear it (not sure how you dont hear a baby cry) or cba dealing with it. \n\nI think its perfectly valid for OP to want to spend her free time at home rather than going out if she's dealing with her own depression and still going out of her way to help her sister with childcare and housework. Even getting out of bed can be a massive struggle for someone going through depression so I think OP should be proud of going out of her way to be there for her sister while dealing with her own issues, and if she doesn't appreciate it then personally I would go home and let the new parents enjoy taking care of the baby by themselves.", "When the \"behaviour\" is needing rest, and not being able to go out every single day because they're too exhausted after doing all the housework, cooking and  a considerable amount of childcare too - including at night - then yes, OP's sister should be accepting that there are limits. \n\nOP is there to help, not to be an unquestioning slave. She needs rest, just like every other human being in the world. She has gone out with her sister many times already, but it's reasonable not to want to go out every single day, especially when she is the one doing all the hard work of going out.", "OP is with sister out of the goodness of her heart and is willing to leave. It\u2019s sister who is ungrateful for the household help provided. OOP is not required to essentially provide entertainment for her sister.\n\nSo fine \u2014 OOP can leave and sister can do eeeeeeverything herself. No \u201ccompromise\u201d needed at all but I doubt sister will like that any better.\n\nAs a mom myself who has three kids, what sister really needs right now is a mommy and me group.", "She's even doing night feeds no wonder she doesn't want to go out during the day as well", "Free babysitter, cook, and maid. Already gone on multiple outings with sister and been the one to manage the baby the whole time. It's very nice to go to a park when you don't have to be the one managing the baby", "She isn't though.  She leaves the baby at home with OP* When both parents are out. OP is on baby duty.  That's what I meant", "Why is she still the asshole if she is helping her with the baby and chores?
