Neither is wrong exactly, it\u2019s just conflicting needs. Plus, both of you are exhausted and she\u2019s full of postpartum hormones (4th trimester), which is turning this pretty small thing into a big thing. \n\nIt seems you\u2019re not capable of being the person she wants you to be right now. Ok. So expectations need to get reset. You two need to talk about it and figure out where to go from here. You need more regular alone time to recover. That needs to be taken into account. She needs more time with people to thrive. You can\u2019t be that person every single time. Help her find others to make up for it, while also making the effort to be that person SOMETIMES.", "NTA.

It\u2019s wonderful that you want to help her WITH the baby - but most people forget that a new mother needs more help then just with chores and the baby. They need human interaction. I\u2019m a first time mom myself, and I\u2019m going stir crazy in my house alone with the baby, and I\u2019m not an outdoorsy, outgoing person.

Not her going out.", "YTA.\n\n> I went over to help her\n\nAnd she\u2019s telling you loud and clear that the help she needs right now is having someone go with her and get her out of the house.  So yeah, maybe it is a chore.  Just add it to the list with the cooking and cleaning, and try and muster up the strength for *one* outing a day, or it may be time to ask yourself what you\u2019re really contributing by sticking around.", "NTA She sounds needy and ungrateful. If helping out with the chores and baby isn't enough for her, I'd just leave.", "INFO: if you are holed up in your room, how are you able to help? Do you still go out to help with baby stuff within the house?", "YTA but only because you came to help her but you don't want to do the things that would help her. You're not just a guest, you came to help. If you were just visiting to see your sister then you would be a guest and you could choose to stay cooped up but if you're there to help her then you should know that will entail going out and helping with the baby's things.", "YTA; you've offered to help out but you're holed up in a room refusing to do what the new mother is saying would be helpful. Why not just try going out with her, and see if the great outdoors with a baby is really as overwhelming as you imagine? I expect it isn't.\n\nEdit: Also, she's stated that she's depressed and you're making her feel worse - post-natal depression is a real and serious thing. If you really want to help her, you should facilitate her doing what she feels is important (which appears to be walking in a park with her baby and someone she loves) and talk to her about the issues she's having.", "YTA. \n\nShe even suggested a park, which is a great compromise. Helping her doesn\u2019t just mean labor-wise, but she needs emotional support too. Having a baby takes a major toll, including with hormones and PPD.

Help includes her getting out of the house with the baby.  That's what people do with babies - take them outside, especially to the park.  Fresh air, sunshine, etc.    I could see if it was just one day and you were tired and not up for it, but not multiple days.  It sounded like she was trying to compromise by going to the park, not out partying, long trips etc.  Even a walk every day down the street would be good for all of you.   I've noticed even when I'm exhausted, getting outside for a bit really helps me feel a bit better.  If she's dealing with post-partum, it especially would be good for her.", "YTA. Go home.", "NTA. I am not sure that it's the best idea to take a one month old on a crowded metro during flu and cold (and Covid and RSV) season. \n\nDoes she have any other friends she can go out with, while you stay home with the baby?", "I mean, you went over to help her, did you not?

You\u2019re there to help her with the baby, but it sounds like you\u2019re more of a nanny. I get that she wants to escape the house every once in a while, and yes, as a new mom she needs that. But it\u2019s not fair to pressure you into going with her. It would be different if you were there for a holiday or to just hang out with her, but as you said you\u2019re there to help her with the baby since hubby can\u2019t. Let her know though how you\u2019re feeling, maybe she just doesn\u2019t understand your position. Also it sounds like you both need an outing without baby. Maybe on a night when hubby is home?", "She's probably tired of being cooped up at home with a new baby.

If you\u2019re there to help out, and be a support for your sister, staying holed up on your sister house is a bit of an asshole move.

Some new moms end up experiencing a change in their social lives. Like, childless friends no longer wanting to hang out with them, or people coming over and only focusing on what the baby needs and not what the mom needs too, or just not being able to go out and be social with other adults. (My brother was a stay at home dad for a while and had an issue with this until he just got recently got a job he really enjoys and now he gets to spend the day with adults again instead of toddlers being his only source of socialization.)\n\nSo just keep that in mind whenever your sister asks you to go out with her again. She may need more than just the physical help of pushing the stroller and changing diapers. She may need to know you\u2019re there for her mentally and emotionally too and are someone she can spend time with and talk to like an adult too.", "NTA you agreed to help with chores, you are.

If it's too much, you can leave, but if it's just a matter of adjustments, you stop being hostile and listen to each other. \n\nI cannot believe just going to the park is that exhausting for you.\n\nAlso, if she likes going out with baby, I suggest getting and using a soft baby carrier (Tula is popular, but there are many other types like ring slings and whatnot) so she can wear the baby instead of always lugging a heavy stroller. It makes a huge difference when using public transit.", "NAH. Honestly, expecting you to go out with her *every single day* is a touch unreasonable. It is in fact okay that you don\u2019t have the capacity for that. It sounds like you HAVE been stretching yourself to be there for your sister but you can\u2019t be there the way she needs anymore. Sister isn\u2019t an asshole because she\u2019s just trying to feel human and like herself, but her expectations aren\u2019t really realistic. Nobody can be expected to go out with you every single day even if you are postpartum. Talk to her gently and explain. Encourage her to reach out to friends. Help her find a play group or another way for her to get out with other people. There doesn\u2019t need to be animus and a breakdown of relationship here.", "Why does it have to be all or nothing though? I'm doing what I'm capable of doing but because it's not enough I should just go home and leave her alone altogether?", "Counterpoint: don't ask people for help they can't give and then get mad about it. Much like nobody asks a broke single mom for money to pay their rent, most people wouldn't ask a depressed person to be social support. It's demanding water from an empty well.\n\nIf sister doesn't want help with cooking, cleaning, and watching the baby she's free to send OP home.", "I thought the same thing. Going to the park, getting outside for simple, small trips, is good for everyone's health (mom, baby, and probably OP as well). If mom was wanting to go on elaborate trips somewhere, which is what the post sounded like at first, I would 100% be on OP's side.\n\nBut just going to the park to hang out for an hour? That sounds like a reasonable request for someone with a one month old. It's not good to stay cooped up constantly, fresh air will be good for the baby. And if OP is on hand to help mom, I can see how mom would want to take advantage of having the extra set of hands and eyes for a park trip. This is a normal and healthy activity, which makes me lean YTA.", "Thank you, it's enlightening to understand her side in detail like this. I have a question, if someone was staying home with you, watching tv/dramas with you and discussing it, interacting with them throughout the day for little things, would it be enough interacting for you or would you need more? Or is it specifically about going out of the house?", "Another child that's doing a bunch of cleaning and taking care of the baby? Okay. OP should go home and let sister do all that herself again. I'm sure after doing all the housework plus baby care with no help she'll have plenty of time and energy to go out.", "Read the comments. Op is only staying in their room when sister goes out - so is even being extra courteous not to violate privacy or take up resources.", "OP has commented that they have been cooking, cleaning, taking care of baby and getting up for night feedings and diaper changes.

If OPs sister can't appreciate the help she is getting then let her deal with everything on her own.", "I'm helping out with things she has to exert physical effort to do like cleaning the bathroom/mopping the floors/doing laundry/cooking and going with her to her doctor appointments.

OP is helping out a lot around the house, why can\u2019t new mom go for a walk with baby on her own?

How hard could it be for the gregarious sister to just call one of her many friends??? I hope OP doesn't burn out trying to make internet strangers happy", "Holy shit so glad to see a NTA verdict. It sounds like the OP is doing quite a bit judging from her comments. The one thing she can't do is public interaction but she seems to be pulling a lot of weight elsewhere and IMO that's absolutely fine.

When we went out on outings before, I'd take care of the stroller and carrying the bags.", "OP isn\u2019t holding up when sister is home though, only to decompress when sister is out of the house. That\u2019s totally different.", "Refusing to go out with her sister, not refusing to clean or cook. And if sister is going out alone and husband is at work, then who's looking after the baby? OP.", "It probably means doing chores and cleaning and then using her well-deserved free time to go goblin in private. Reasonable.", "Why not call someone else to go out with her? Why do I have to be the one to do everything? I want to help but this is my bandwidth right now and I'm telling her it's been stretched thin.", "I did twice.  No one helped.  NTA", "Don't listen to strangers on Reddit. Go talk to your sister about this.", "If you're unwilling or unable to put yourself out for a little while to help her the way she wants to be helped it may be for the best, but I would suggest trying to have a better conversation with your sister and perhaps come to a compromise.", "Are you helping? WhT do you do yo help?", "You and your sister need to have an open and honest discussion about what she needs and what you are able to give. You cannot burn yourself out trying to help her, but I think if the two of you talk you\u2019ll either be able to come to a compromise of how you can help her, or realize that you being around without being able to give what she needs is more harmful than helpful", "At the very least this should make you more empathetic to her mental health right now. New moms really struggle to feel any semblance or normalcy or retain their identity outside of \u201cmom.\u201d Being postpartum, cooped up in the house with a new baby, it really sucks and can negatively affect your mental health.", "No shade for having a depressive disorder, that sounds super rough and I'm glad you're getting help for it. That being said, if you are physically/mentally incapable of providing care, I'm not really understanding why you're there at all. I don't intend this in an insulting way - we all have our limits and it's good to know what yours is! However, you definitely need to communicate your capabilities and listen to your sister's expectations. It doesn't sound like you are compatible with the level of care required in this situation.", "Are you living with your sister right now? As in you don't have another place to live? Just wondering", "Refusing to go to the park is too much and I imagine your therapist would agree you should be able to go to a local park. In fact they would likely suggest you take a walk in the sunshine every day. Because that is necessary for health.\n\nGoing into a bustling city may be too much.  I get that, same sometimes. Especially if you're reliant on public transport which it sounds like you are.  Work your way up with baby steps.\n\nHowever refusing to go to the local park is too much and frankly it's self-sabotage to hole up inside and shun outside interaction - holing up inside too much will exacerbate depression.\n\nSource: have lived with depression for over 20 years\n\nHonestly I cannot give a judgement in terms of AITA. however I can at minimum say \"ask your therapist if they think you should be taking a walk to a local park once in awhile\".", "That's very nice of you. If your sister wants to go out so badly, she should find someone willing to do that. That's it. NTA", "Fair enough. Comment was made before OPs additional comments. I think OP should edit the post but my judgment stands.", "No sister is taking the baby out", "Op had said in a comment that they only stay in the room when sister goes out so it might be goblin but it also may be being extra courteous not to use sister's space when sister isn't there.", "[deleted]", ">\tWhy not call someone else to go out with her? Why do I have to be the one to do everything?\n\nGet out of their house then and stop taking up guest room space.

Your sister has told you want type of help she needs clearly. If you don\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d just leave", "Just go home if you\u2019re going to continue to behave this way.", ">Why do I have to be the one to do everything?\n\nYou are not doing everything.

You choose to step up and help, So either step up or step out of her way.", "Because youre there *to help*", "You're there to help her so she doesn't have to call someone else tho that's the point of u being there", "I'm sorry no one helped you", "I have my own home, I'm staying temporarily.", "But that's not how the entire 24 hours work. Op commented what chores she does (cleaning, mopping, baby stuff). She helps. And then after helping, she rests in her own way. Sister sounds ungrateful to be honest."]}
