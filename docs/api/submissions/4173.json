Today, she told me we will just go to the nearest park and that it's unhealthy for me to stay cooped up in the house all the time.\n\nI declined again and she became upset and said she wasn't in the mood to go out anymore. She said why I was even over if all I wanted to do was to stay home, that she was depressed and I'm making her feel worse. I told her she can always go by herself and leave the baby with me but she said that defeats the point of having company.\n\nShe grumbled about no one caring about her and went into their bedroom and shut the door. I've been thinking maybe I should've just suck it up and just go with her but I don't know why she insists on me going out too when I said I'm exhausted.\n\nIdk, AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I tried to knock and talk to her but she still won't talk to me so I wrote her a letter and slipped it underneath the door. I'm on my way to the hotel until my flight is up (we live in two different countries so sorry, the kind suggestions for coming once a week...etc are impossible. Once I'm gone I'm gone for a good while.)\n\nEdit to add info:\nI'm doing all household maintenance and cooking except for folding their laundry, cleaning up their bedroom, or grocery shopping as her husband takes care of these. \n\nSome nights when I hear the baby crying and none of them woke up I go feed him and put him back to sleep. During the day, we can both be in the house and I'd be the one changing him up sometimes. When she's out I watch him. When she needs to go to her doctor appointments I go with her and watch him outside. When we went out on outings before, I'd take care of the stroller and carrying the bags.", "created_utc": 1670426919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf3w8y/aita_for_refusing_to_go_out_with_my_sister_when/", "score": 8802, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it\u2019s not fair to pressure you into going with her. It would be different if you were there for a holiday or to just hang out with her, but as you said you\u2019re there to help her with the baby since hubby can\u2019t.

Some new moms end up experiencing a change in their social lives. Like, childless friends no longer wanting to hang out with them, or people coming over and only focusing on what the baby needs and not what the mom needs too, or just not being able to go out and be social with other adults. (My brother was a stay at home dad for a while and had an issue with this until he just got recently got a job he really enjoys and now he gets to spend the day with adults again instead of toddlers being his only source of socialization.)\n\nSo just keep that in mind whenever your sister asks you to go out with her again. She may need more than just the physical help of pushing the stroller and changing diapers. She may need to know you\u2019re there for her mentally and emotionally too and are someone she can spend time with and talk to like an adult too.", "NTA you agreed to help with chores, you are.

Sister isn\u2019t an asshole because she\u2019s just trying to feel human and like herself, but her expectations aren\u2019t really realistic. Nobody can be expected to go out with you every single day even if you are postpartum. Talk to her gently and explain. Encourage her to reach out to friends. Help her find a play group or another way for her to get out with other people. There doesn\u2019t need to be animus and a breakdown of relationship here.", "Why does it have to be all or nothing though? I'm doing what I'm capable of doing but because it's not enough I should just go home and leave her alone altogether?", "Counterpoint: don't ask people for help they can't give and then get mad about it. Much like nobody asks a broke single mom for money to pay their rent, most people wouldn't ask a depressed person to be social support. It's demanding water from an empty well.\n\nIf sister doesn't want help with cooking, cleaning, and watching the baby she's free to send OP home.", "I thought the same thing. Going to the park, getting outside for simple, small trips, is good for everyone's health (mom, baby, and probably OP as well). If mom was wanting to go on elaborate trips somewhere, which is what the post sounded like at first, I would 100% be on OP's side.\n\nBut just going to the park to hang out for an hour? That sounds like a reasonable request for someone with a one month old. It's not good to stay cooped up constantly, fresh air will be good for the baby. And if OP is on hand to help mom, I can see how mom would want to take advantage of having the extra set of hands and eyes for a park trip. This is a normal and healthy activity, which makes me lean YTA.", "Thank you, it's enlightening to understand her side in detail like this. I have a question, if someone was staying home with you, watching tv/dramas with you and discussing it, interacting with them throughout the day for little things, would it be enough interacting for you or would you need more? Or is it specifically about going out of the house?", "Another child that's doing a bunch of cleaning and taking care of the baby? Okay. OP should go home and let sister do all that herself again.

Your sleep is disturbed your work schedule is upended, and you're doing that out of the kindness of your heart because you care about her.\n\nIt's okay if you don't want to go out with her, but I think there may also be a little bit of dependency going on here with her, she's capable of carrying a stroller or a baby bag but you're doing it all and watching the kid? It sounds like you started doing it at first because she was fresh out of the birth but she's never taken the jobs on since then. If you want to stay and work it out you may want to try delegating more jobs back to her slowly. Starting with the jobs surrounding trips out. She needs to organise the transport and the stroller and the baby supplies and you need to let her fail if she forgets something or doesn't plan out what she needs well enough. If you keep doing it she'll get used to it.\n\nIf you are able to hand over more of these jobs to her then that may make you more amenable to going out with her and you could even offer that as a suggestion and say you'll go out with her x times a week provided she's responsible for the arrangements and takes on more of the work. It's unfair to expect you to essential act as a parent to this kid and also a cook and cleaner and then accuse you of not caring.\n\nI think she's making it clear what support she needs now so you need to start dropping some of the other jobs back to her like the cleaning or cooking for everyone.

If she wants company while out, she can call a friend, her husband when he has a day off, even your parents. There\u2019s a multitude of people who can go out with her, not just you. Besides, some people is saying that pushing the stroll can take a toll on her body, but you\u2019re already doing so much at her home and they\u2019re asking you to ALSO push the stroll like that it won\u2019t take a toll on you, the one who\u2019s doing the chores. Being a mom is hard, she was the one who gave birth and has to feed the baby if she\u2019s not using formula, but that\u2019s not an excuse to diminish what you\u2019re doing for her when it\u2019s not even your responsibility.", "NTA You're helping in the ways you can without completely breaking yourself for your sister.

I think it's interesting that your sister isn't taking you up on your offer to stay home with the baby while she socializes. She might be depressed from not socializing. Staying in the house might be unhealthy for her, but not for you.

You do all the normal and helpful things to help your sister around the house. In fact, you do so much that you are essentially the second parent and are exhausted as a parent would be. If you are an introvert who doesn't gain energy from going out, *it is completely fine to take some time to be alone*. The fact that you are willing to look after the baby while your sister goes out shows that this isn't about your sister's desperate need to go out and be around other people, but instead about controlling you and the ways you need to decompress. Where is your sister's partner in all this?? Why do you have to supply every single need your sister has?\n\nAnd frankly, more to the point, why is your sister so desperate to bring a baby on the metro or crowded areas when it sounds like the baby is a newborn?? Ignoring covid (though obviously this is a huge one), there's still a terrible flu and RSV and all sorts of things out there that a newborn can't fight and it sounds like it's too soon to vaccinate the baby to make such activities safe. If the baby is old enough to be vaccinated, I would say that you have spent more than enough time helping an ungrateful sister and should go back to dealing with your own health crisis. Your sister is selfish and lacks understanding or empathy if she thinks that you being unwilling to go out with a baby in tow is you \"not supporting\" her, particularly when you have offered a juice compromise.

I actually cannot fathom the thought process to say Y T A they all sound incredibly entitled. Absolutely NTA. You\u2019re over there helping her with everything you\u2019re able to. If she needs company to go outside she should find someone else who can help since you\u2019re helping w literally everything else. I\u2019m actually so blown away by anyone saying anything other than NTA - OP didn\u2019t choose to have this baby but she is going above and beyond what any single family member other than the parents should be doing.", "Oh HELL NO to those a-hole comments! \n\nBasically, you're doing all the cleaning of the house, the cooking, the laundry (except folding their clothes) PLUS baby care... Including MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT CARE?!\n\nAND you've gone out with her every single day and now you're getting shit when you're asking for a break by recharging in your room? \n\nNTA! Your sister is damn lucky. If she wants you to leave, when can you come over to my place because you sound like a blessing.", "NAH  \n\n\nsounds like she needs someone more outgoing to help her out if her main reason for going out is for company, and you can still stay home with the kid so she or that other friend do not need to lug all the stroller and kid stuff around", "NAH. It sounds like you are doing a lot to help with the household, cleaning, and the baby. It also makes sense that she needs to get out of the house. But I don't understand why it HAS to be with you? You are already helping so much. There are so many places/events/groups etc, that help with socializing for new moms. Or another option....what about your sister going out with her husband when he is home?\n\nEvery new mom is different, so I can't pretend to know what she is going through at 6 weeks post partum, but only have my experience to lean on for context. I had twins. I didn't want someone staying with me after birth, I would be anxious about feeling like having to entertain even the most close person. I also wanted to learn how to take care of the twins by myself. I walked my oldest to school and back with the twins in their stroller when they were a month old (like 8 blocks roundtrip). That was too much lol. But I learned from it. And so I took them out for short trips like once a day just to get out. I learned so much doing that, about what I needed for the stroller, diaper bag, how to feed them in different places/situations....and all that built my confidence up as a new mom. So I wonder if you can frame it that way with her if/when you talk? You can help relieve chores/work at home for her, and her outings can be a way for her to learn how to do it with a baby by herself and so she knows she can be her extroverted self when she doesnt have another person with?", "NAH - I think you and your sister are just different people with different needs. She just had a baby and is probably struggling with not having as much freedom to do things as she used to. She might need to get out of the house and be around other people.\n\nYou on the other hand are burnt out and need rest. It is a lot on you to go out and you are already doing what you can to help with the baby and the house.\n\nI wonder if a compromise could be made where you do something social, but at the house. Maybe a paint night, or movie night or board games. It would give you both time to connect, but in a less overwhelming way.\n\nSounds like your sister wants to connect with, but had a bad way of saying it. And I am so sorry you are burnt out. I hope you also have support for yourself and maybe seek out a therapist if you do not already have one. Hell, maybe your sister should get one too.", "NAH\n\n\n\nYou are doing a good thing and helping in a good way. She is an outgoing postpartum new mom who is feeling all sorts of conflicting emotions and is still incredibly hormonal. \n\n\nShe has different social needs than you, and they are needs. Your social needs and her social needs are both independently valid! She is frustrated that your social needs are not aligning with hers because she would like your help and company while achieving her social needs, and likely sees your refusals as an opposition to her social needs instead of what it really is, a protection of your social needs. It's a simple incompatibility that's causing some hurt feelings in a stressful time. \n\n\nThe two of you just need to sit down and have a really good heart to heart. \n\n\nSometimes my sister and I need to have a good scream at each other, a couple of drinks, and then we find our way back to each other.

Again, NTA.", "You and uour sister need to talk and just understand each other a bit more.  My guess is that you previously both felt you did.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell you that she invited you over specifically to have someone to run the streets with.  It sounds like that is what she needs.

Kudos to them because when my depression was at its worse, I couldn\u2019t get myself out of bed, but they\u2019re at least helping their sister out around the house. They even offered to watch the baby if sister wanted to go out, so sis could\u2019ve reached out to friends they haven\u2019t seen in a while or something. OP needs to communicate with sis more, and maybe compromise like going out one day for lunch, because I also empathize with her feeling stir crazy from being cooped up (though it is not OP\u2019s fault like she\u2019s trying to make it out to be).", "If no one cares about her then leave.

Your sister is using the hell out of you and she\u2019s trying to guilt trip you into doing literally everything for her while she continues to pretend she\u2019s not a mom now. She needs to get on her own two feet and realize that if she was doing everything you were doing she\u2019d be burnt out too.

Most people have a lot to say on what you should be doing when half of them have never had a baby nor helped with a baby. I suppose if your sister wants your help doing chores, helping with baby, being her counselor, going out for hours of the day, giving massages, and anything else on a whim you should do it just because you offered help in the first place. That\u2019s not how help works. You\u2019re not a workhorse and you don\u2019t suddenly forget your own mental health just because she has had a baby.

What is she going to do without you? Seriously? \nAlso. Yes you are a guest but you are there to help. Not make sure she can go on outings and so motherhood doesn\u2019t change anything about her life.

If you are a distraction from her sadness it\u2019s going to come crashing down.", "NTA  \n\n\nI get that for someone so outgoing, companionship is a way to charge up and run down social battery...... but you are contributing to her needs by doing childcare and chores.   \n\n\nDon't feel bad for not giving something you can't give.", "NTA.  But.  Consider the walk to the park (as long as it doesn\u2019t include a metro ride).  Fresh air is always a plus.", "NTA - When I read what going out means to you (running to restrooms to change diapers, carrying the stroller, feedings), all I could think is, What is Momma doing on these trips?  \n\nThen I read your comments about all the stuff you are doing, and frankly, it sounds like you are doing everything.\n\nVisiting to help means help, not taking over complete care for the house, the baby, and the mom.\n\nYou have a right to set boundaries.\n\nPlus, the baby was born a month ago?  Even grandparents are gone by that time, and most mothers are caring for their babies without help\n\nHowever, postpartum depression is a real thing, and I worry about that baby if you leave. \n\nYou need to tell your sister that she needs to get help by seeing a doctor about her depression.\n\nYou also need to set a date to leave and be very clear with her that on such and such a day you will be returning home.", "NTA, and it's great of you to help your sister like this, but maybe you could go out with her to the park or other chill destinations now and then?  It's normal, and good for her, to get out of the house, and I can see why she'd rather have you accompany her on outings than go alone.\n\nIf this is her first child, she's just been hit by a truck, physically and emotionally.  Now is the time in her life when she needs the most support.  If you can give her a little more by keeping her company on a few outings -- not every day, but maybe every other day? -- you'd be doing something great.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA - you offer help at your will not hers.", "NTA, but going to the park seemed like a good compromise.  So I think you can do better.  Especially as it means a lot to your sister.", "NTA - you\u2019ve gone above and beyond what is be expected of you as an auntie/sister. I think your sister is being ridiculous and selfish. Yes, having a child and being a new mum is hard but not everyone has this level of support.

She might not realise how difficult it is for you to do everything.", "NTA- The number of self entitled commenters calling you TA in here is INSANE! You freely offer to help with her baby, and help around the house. There is zero reason you should feel any guilt about being an introvert.\n\nAnyone telling someone that generously gives their free time to help a new mom an AH needs to check their level of entitlement. If OP's sister needs to get out of the house so much she is free to do so. Having a child entitles you to nothing. She should be thankful OP is generous enough to be there at all.", "NTA. \n\nIf I were you I would go home. \n\nShe doesn't appreciate you because she had no idea how much you're doing. \n\nLet her handle things for a few days.

Big hugs to you!!", "So as a new mom, I feel I can give decent insight on this. While OPs feelings are valid, I don\u2019t think OP realizes the effect of her actions on her sister. It is really important to adjust a baby to society/get used to doing things outside the house with a baby. OPs sister doesn\u2019t necessarily need OP to do these things, but it probably is a lot more stressful for sister to have OP providing such a negative outlook on her new normal. It may suck for OP to think about all the stuff that will potentially happen while out with a newborn, but that\u2019s not OPs normal. It\u2019s sisters normal and to have someone who locked themselves in their room so they don\u2019t have to participate, shouldn\u2019t be in the house in the first place IMO. \n\nSo yes, OP, YTA", "This, this needs to be higher.

While SIL gave birth, OP is the mom instead or more like the unpaid maid.", "Hijacking the top-voted comment for visibility because while OP is certainly NTA, I'm worried based on the last two paragraphs that OP's sister is potentially showing signs/symptoms of postpartum depression and it might be a very good idea to gently broach the topic with OP's sister and see if she'd be willing to call her OB or primary care doctor for screening and, if necessary, a referral to someone that can help her find relief. It sounds like she's feeling lonely, perhaps isolated, she says she's depressed, and she feels like no one cares about her. This likely has little to do with OP or going on outings, and a lot to do with hormones and brain chemistry and might get significantly worse without diagnosis and treatment if it is indeed postpartum depression. OP, would you be willing to talk to your sister about these feelings and offer to accompany her to a doctor's appointment to see if they might be able to help your sister find relief?", "I agree. I think NAH though. The sister is probably stressed and still hormonal. And probably also depressed or sad like she mentioned.\n\nThere is a lot that goes into both emotions.

You are helping as much as you can in the ways you can.\nI would encourage her to set up hangouts with friends and she can either take the baby or leave baby with you.

You have your limits, but I totally get why your sister is frustrated by your willingness to help in some ways only. \n\nIt's kind of like if you went to stay with her to help clean the house but put your foot down at absolutely zero Swiffering. Vaccuming, mopping, sweeping? All fine, BUT NO GODDAMN SWIFFER. So when it's a Swiffer room you go for a break or whatever and she's just wondering what's up your ass about Swiffering.\n\nIt's incredibly important for new moms to do more than sit at home stuck with the kid. It's great that you're there to relieve her. It's also perfectly understandable that she also wants to go for short walks and could use help if a diaper needs to be changed while out. \n\nWas she aware of your personality/conditions before you offered to help? Clear communication would go a long way here, she thinks you're a bummer and you're depressed and you seem to not really be understanding the toll that being stuck at home with a new baby takes on mental health when you can't even go for a short walk without it being a huge deal.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, and you should absolutely have limits.

Again, having limits is vital, but maybe you can drop a few chores and instead venture a bit out of the house as a trade off.", "NAH\n\nBut really, you should try to just make a little extra effort and go out with her.

Helping with overnight feeds so they can get some sleep? Amazing. Cooking and doing dishes? Fantastic. However, I will add that being a new mom is exhausting and a big struggle is still trying to feel like you\u2019re still your own person. Yes you\u2019re keeping her afloat but what she might need for herself is to get out of the house. I needed to otherwise I started feeling stir-crazy and like all of the days were blurring together. Going for an outing or a task makes you feel like you\u2019ve completed something that day and you feel productive versus just going through the motions of feed, diaper change, nap, repeat. \n\nIt might make her anxious to have to go out alone and she might need that adult connection, hence why she didn\u2019t feel like going once you said no. Maybe all of the things that you don\u2019t like about outings are what she doesn\u2019t like either, but it feels doable with a partner.

Going to the park with OP is not the answer.", "I'm not gonna argue with you at all that OP is nowhere near in the wrong, and in this case the sister *is* TA, regardless of the reasoning for it. I'm also not nearly as concerned about the difference in our definitions of \"brat\" as I am in the huge misunderstanding in general that exists around post partum depression. The only qualm I really take in what you're saying is how you're equating post partum depression to \"being a brat\" because it's a serious medical condition that can escalate easily and quickly. You have absolutely no idea whether or not this particular situation is life or death, because you are not qualified to diagnose this woman over a Reddit post her sister made. I have a problem with the language you are choosing to use regarding post partum specifically, but I have no problem at all with your judgement of the sister as part of this post and community.", "True fact. \n\nI kept saying no honey I can see her right here, I'm touching her. But he was sleeping. And the pregnancy wonked us both right out. Forty weeks with twins ain't no joke!", "Very smart of your mom.... you hear about forgotten kids in the backseat more with the secondary caregiver because it's not part of their daily routine. Sleep deprivation is no joke either. I went into my first born 2 week check-up crying. My kid never slept.", "Absolutely! It's also possible that OP is doing tangible tasks that her sister doesn't actually *care* about OP helping with. It sounds to me like a mismatch in expectations overall, tbh. If I told my sister I had the bandwidth to either do her dishes, cook, and clean the bathroom, or to go out on outings with her, but not both, she'd pick the outings lol. My sister's first home visit the nurse asked if she'd actually had a baby, because she cleans when she's stressed and the first week was really stressful!", "NTA you\u2019re there to help her with the baby. You even offered for her to go while you watch the baby. Also, I\u2019m trying not to be judgmental but why would she be going out with a newborn or going out and coming back to her newborn? Covid is still very much a thing.", "NTA. Sure, she is outgoing, she has had a night nanny taking care of the baby when he wakes up, and now she is raring to go.\n\nAs long as the nanny is along to drag the stroller, diaper bag, etc. But that nanny is tired out and just wants to veg.\n\nI think your sister is being an asshole.", "Yes! This is exactly my thoughts. Sister needs to get out of the house and have something that resembles normalcy after being isolated with these first 6 weeks. OP is beyond wanting to go out and socialize after being there for her sister and her new baby. Maybe the sister can call a friend and be her social connection while OP gets some alone time?", "Yes!!!!!!!!!", "She should just go home. The new mother had help for 6 weeks and is rested enough to want to resume an active social lifestyle. The need for help is over.", "Scrolled down to see if this was suggested, thank you Lostin1 der! Also just to reiterate, NTA.", "Op did communicate and her sister turned around and said \u201cno one cares about her. What excuse will the sister have next?", "Absolutely all of this. Postpartum is a sneaky depression because you're having such highs and lows and melancholy. Its not OPs job to accommodate her mental health issues but it might help OP to understand her.", "I did include that, it\u2019s in the paragraph underneath. :)", "Mine are 3 and 6 and I\u2019d take this now! \n\nOP should be charging as an Au Pair.", "Absolutely agree.  I had massive PP anxiety and it took its toll on me.  I couldn\u2019t drive myself any more and could only ride in the car if either my husband or my SIL/BFF was driving.  My SIL had her 2nd baby 3 weeks before I had my first and she was so helpful. I had my husband drop baby and I off every morning before work and we stayed all day with SIL, newborn niece and 3 year old nephew.  It helped a lot with my PP anxiety. \n\nOP NTA for not wanting to follow sis around all of her outings after taking majority care of newborn and household chores.", "Yeah, the conventional advice I've heard for visiting someone with a newborn is go over, say hi to the baby, wash some dishes and leave.\n\nEither something else is going on or the sister is being really entitled.\n\nNTA", "I always offer my friends this.  I\u2019ll watch the baby, go take a nap, long shower, a walk, get a pedicure - go do you for an hour to so - I\u2019ll text if I have questions.  Or if they don\u2019t want to leave the baby, sit and be while I clean the kitchen and living and do a load or two of laundry..  Best thing you can offer a new mom is time and an extra set of hands that are productive.", "NTA at all. Your there to help with the baby, not provide entertainment to your sister.\n\nWhen my son was a few weeks old I had to pop to the shop for some nappies. My Mum waited in the car with the boy whilst I had the most glorious stroll around the supermarket for 45 mins to buy one thing! It was the first time I had been on my own in 6 weeks and it was glorious!", "I read it as she is depressed that OP won't go out with her. Someone who is depressed, generally isn't wanting to go out everyday and be with people. I do think all mothers should be screened for PPD on every visit. Sometimes it doesn't come for months after.", "Where does it say OP's sister cried?", "My therapist tells me this, but they also recommend I be mindful of my boundaries, don't feel like I *have* to push myself too far, that it's okay that I need time to recharge. That I'm not failing anything by not even getting out of the bed in some days and that I'm struggling with something difficult.\n\nIt would be wonderful if everyone could just take the advice of 'going outside and taking walks', but brain chemistry doesn't work just like that. It's not a matter of, 'this is what you have to do, so just go and do it'. If it was, I'd be cured.", "Some moms really know how to take care of their babies, even when their  babies are having babies!", "Like why is a mother with a 6 week old baby taking the baby out everyday to new places? Babies don't have a good immune system until 6 months.  OP sounds normal, tired after taking care of the household and most baby cares all day.", "Oh no. That's so good of you.", "She could have joined a mom's group.", "I was the first of my friends to have a baby and it can be very isolating.  It sound like the sister might have the postpartum blues and feels trapped inside. My husband worked long hours so I found things to do during those long days, otherwise I would have gone nuts. Fortunately some old friends with children moved back to my area and more of my friends started having kids so it became much more kid friendly in my group.  \n\nOP is only there temporarily so even if  she went places with her sister, the sister would still have to find baby friends to socialize with.  I don't think it would hurt OP to go out for a stroll in a nearby park with her sis although she's not really obligated.  Maybe she (Sis) feels better having backup interacting with other mothers at this park for the first time.  It can be awkward when you don't know anyone and the others are all sitting around chatting. And it can be a huge adjustment going from perhaps having a career or being childless to having a child to look after 24/7.  I think all mothers miss the days of being able to lie around reading a book or taking a nap in the afternoon, just having time on your own.  \n\nSo is OP obligated to accompany her Sis on these outings?? No, but I don't think it would hurt OP to do some stuff with her sis.  I ended up living in another country than the rest of my family,  in fact, Mom and Dad lived in one country,  my two sisters in a 2nd country but different states, and me in a 3rd country.  I know when I went to visit the various members of my family, they would want to show me everything their town or city had to offer.  They would plan in advance the places they wanted to take me just as I planned on taking them to the places I thought they'd enjoy.  I think that's fairly common and that is probably what Sis wanted to do with OP, take her to her favorite places, that's all.  I personally was always excited to go out to these various attractions not only because I was excited to see and try new things but because I was happy to experience them with my family, happy to be with them.  Again, not an obligation but I'm a bit surprised OP wasn't interested in doing anything at all.  Why are you so tired OP? Overworked or perhaps a health condition? I wonder if OP is depressed?", "Mmm, I did that and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s healthy.  I got pretty bad post natal depression and constant vigilance over my infant wasn\u2019t helping.  A mom should get a few hours away here and there to reset her perspective and regain a healthy sense of self.  I\u2019m not suggesting wild partying but just a trip out to visit with friends or people watch at a mall or something is often life giving.\n\nUnfortunately all the respiratory illnesses in circulation now really complicate that.", "I don\u2019t know if you did it on purpose but the use of [goblin](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/05/1140696560/oxford-word-2022-goblin-mode) is especially well timed.", "My sister gave birth in May 2020.

I finished school and i still have bad dreams sometimes about school. Which is werid because i didn't when I was actually in school. \n\nIt's like unprepared for test. Or college letters. Or cleaning out school locker but there are so many so i forgot which one was mine and my locker combination.", "I always wondered how big the cars of the people are who forgot their kids in the car. In my car it would have been physically impossible to not see when my baby was in my car, even when he was still backward facing. Every time I changed lanes and did the shoulder look I automatically saw him in the seat, let alone when getting out.", "Yes! I have the same dreams!

But in my dreams I am still trying to pass a math test and find my beige locker among all the other beige lockers.", "Especially when sleep deprived, our brains are wired to dump repetitive things we see as normal.

The big letter delivered to school. A teacher / nun got it and ripped it right in front of me. In the dream. And for some reason i dreamt I was going to have to repeat m senior year of highschool for some reason. It felt so real.", "This!!! When you help people, it\u2019s only seen as helping if they ask for it.", "Sounds like we have the same sister! The only solution we've found is doing the few things I like outside of the house together. I like grocery shopping, I like bookstores, I love farmers markets, and about 4 restaurants (at non peak hours).

But it wasn't without a decade or more of compromise", "NTA\nYou have worked hard to help support your sister.\n\nI'm worried about your sister's mental well-being and also about the baby. Why don't they hear him/her?  The baby should be in the parents room for at least the first 6 months.", "NTA - I am really concerned for your sister. Not because you won't step up, but the father of her baby obviously isn't. That is very concerning and I feel really sorry for her that she has to go through this virtually alone. However, it is not your responsibility to step up to the plate when the father of the child will not. She has chosen to have a child with his man and now she needs to deal with the consequences of her actions.", "Your sister doesn't care about what YOU want.  She cares about what she wants and that's it.  Best you went home if you're just going to be treated like that when you've been there to help.  NTA", "NTA. What\u2019s the point of you being there? Maybe you\u2019re there to watch her child and help her with chores\u2026 Why doesn\u2019t your sister have any other friends? And why doesn\u2019t her husband ever hang out with her on his days off? This is all just so weird.", "NTA- Your a very good sister and your sister needs to take care of her own baby. I had 5 kids and nobody came to do anything..lol.. I did it all myself cause their father worked. SO instead of being grateful that you flew to a whole different country she wants to act like a spoiled brat. Enjoy your flight home.", "Nta but neither is she, I know what it\u2019s like to want someone to be with you and it\u2019s a lot harder to enjoy time out without said person but she has to understand that if you don\u2019t like going out and being overly social she needs to find someone else to do those things with. Please bare in mind she\u2019s healing from the birth and still incredibly hormonal and is being a bit selfish. You are doing such a lovely thing by being there in the first place and helping so much, she\u2019s super lucky to have a sister that has done that for her! Don\u2019t let her guilt trip you into doing things you\u2019re just not comfortable doing make your case and if she can\u2019t accept that, that\u2019s not your issue. You\u2019re doing so much to help as it is, but she jsut might be having a hard time adjusting and needs a bit of a reality check.

Hate when people blame others for their personal emotions.

I think your responsibility at this point is she expressed feelings about depression; which her partner now needs to know about so he can best support her. Any and all signs of PPD and PPA are both not something to keep secret from the other parent. I\u2019ll give her the benefit of the doubt that she said that she is feeling bad and placing that (misguided)blame on you out of weird mental health related reasoning, which can be helped and made better through treating it early.", "For sure NTA. Excursions with babies are ultra difficult! I would suggest that your sister gets screened for postpartum depression, it sounds like she might be trying to stay distracted and lashed out because you weren't in a position to help her the way she wanted you to.", "NTA\n\nIt's very difficult for an extrovert to understand an introvert. I don't really know how to offer any help other than to try to explain to your sister that you were there to help her take care of the baby and that you're just not a very big \"going out\" person. I've had to have this conversation with my mother for about 20 years. I can't say its ever helped, because she still bugs me to \"go out and socialize.\" But a least you can say you tried.", "NTA\n\nYou have done so much for her! She doesn't even know how you've made her life easier. I'm sorry she doesn't appreciate you.", "NTA.

On the contrary, staying inside brings me peace that I could never have by going out all the time. \n\nI\u2019m very big on protecting my mental health, and by staying indoors, I can avoid interactions with rude and cranky people.

I sympathize with your sister; she had a child, her body has changed and everything after delivery is all blurred at times maybe even difficult but that is not your place to go out every day in tow with her and her child. It is also not your place to have to entertain her and her child, if she would like a day out, she can have at it but I fail to see the problem of why it is unacceptable for you not wanting to join.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re there to help with a baby that isn\u2019t even yours, you\u2019re not there to entertain her. You\u2019re already going out of your way and going to another country to help but she doesn\u2019t understand boundaries. Just leave and let her take care of the baby by herself since she doesn\u2019t appreciate what you\u2019re already doing. She has options, she just wanted to try to force you to do it too instead of being grateful that you left home in another country to take care of a child that you didn\u2019t even HAVE to help with. You\u2019re not OBLIGATED to take care of them, you\u2019re doing it out of love but if she wants to feel entitled and try to force you, you can always leave and remind her that you don\u2019t HAVE to be there for her on her life choices.", "NTA, I understand supporting her but? Why does it sound like they are not the main ones taking care of their baby? Like why do You have to wake up to feed the baby. Why do You have to do the hard work. They need to do better to step up.

I wandered out into the kitchen, said hi to my roommate, couldn't quite bring myself to say \"I can't find the baby!!\" because I was trying not to freak out and didn't want to put the horrible fact into words... then realized that it was the afternoon and I'd just woken up from a nap; I'd taken my daughter to daycare that morning as usual.", "Oh my lord twins are such a different animal. My daughter just had twin boys. Well, they're 6 weeks. I stayed several nights in the beginning, then started just going every day, and now I'm going 2 days a week. \n\nI usually get there when everyone is still sleeping, before daddy is up to get ready for work. I just walk through the house and see what needs done. I run dishwater, check the washer and dryer for clothes and/or put a load in. I grab the broom and sweep the floors. Mop if I have time. Dust/wipe down everything I can. Most times, by the time they wake up, I've got the whole house cleaned and I can spend the rest of the day helping with these sweet beautiful boys. \n\nOur schedules are worked out where my daughter only has them by herself 3 days a week. It's so hard having 2 newborns and they appreciate me so so much and never miss a chance to tell me so.", "That episode was horrifying \u2014 one that has stayed with me even after all this time.", "I was working at an office supply company while I was pregnant. I had my baby and she had a sister who was 2 years old. I got the kids in the car and drove them to my family members house who I was paying to watch them. The drive was like 35 mins but my work was close to where they lived. I dropped my girls off and got a call 10 mins later from my great aunt. I had forgotten the diaper bag. My boss was not happy and neither was I. I had to go all the way back home and get it. After that I made sure to leave stuff there in case it ever happened again.", "We forgot a bottle of milk for our toddler once when we were out.  Fortunately, vanilla ice cream makes an acceptable substitute in a pinch.", "I was Christmas shopping last year and suddenly realized I couldn't see my son! I freaked and started running around looking for him... Until I remembered my son is 29 and wasn't with me.... It never goes away...", "That said, I\u2019m on mat leave right now. Really not that much to clean daily. Maybe more laundry than usual, but not sure what these constant daily chores are that OP would do that is leaving her so burnt out.", "I WAS SCROLLING FOR THIS COMMENT!", "Came here to say the same. Please take this advice. Your sister is absolutely not at 100%, and neither are you. Try to talk this through and recognize you both have different needs. Good luck", "Happy cake day!", "My spouse had 2 months saved up over years from just not being able to take vacation for 6y. Upon leaving, the company had to hire a literal team. \n\nWe don\u2019t know the story here.", "Yes I\u2019m wondering what sister\u2019s plan is once OP goes home. She\u2019s in for a pretty rude shock when she doesn\u2019t have a slave anymore.", "Thank you! I didn't know that.", "Because she doesn't say anything any other time for days but acted in a bad manner once?\n\nI don't think the post suggests that the sister doesn't let OP have alone time, either.", "Oh it definitely does...sister is an extrovert that wants to go out....then go out and leave the introvert alone.", "Oh, you are a shiny unicorn mom! \n\nWe were three states away from our families and only there 11 months before the babies were born...I never call them \"the twins\". My husband's mother came for their third week and did everything. I had a headache for a week after she left. Until I realized the babies couldn't move and they'd just have to wait until I got to them. There's a reason babies can't remember that far back!!\n\nI kept a paper schedule so I could PROVE there was never a time all day when they slept at the same time. My husband did all the night feedings. Every. One. Said he talked to adults at work. \n\nBut...tell your daughter the goal is to make it until they more or less nap at the same times. For me that was about 6 months. They were happier when they could move on their own, too. \n\nAnyhow, they always played so well together and are quietly close now...no shared friends, but there's always that sense of someone there. My daughter said, when i asked if she minded the shared birthday, that she didn't because there was never a kids' birthday where she didn't get presents. Huh. You can maybe tell I have a son and a daughter, which I think is easier in some ways...never mistaken for each other...\n\nSo, you are awesome, enjoy those baby people, and tell your daughter my advice is to read a lot and listen, but do what works for the kids and the family. No one is the same, let their personalities out but take care of you, too, And my kids are 32! It does happen!", "Beautiful story.  Waiting here for family to fly in, and somehow your post makes me tear up and they haven't landed yet. If I had an award for hitting heart strings you would have it \ud83d\ude07", "All good advice and I will tell her. We never say the twins either. It's the babies. I'm so proud of my daughter. She's doing so well. She's breastfeeding even. Not exclusively, because twins, and she's not one of those lucky women with a super huge supply but they are probably getting 60/40 breast/formula. \n\nWe're figuring things out. We've got a pretty good routine established now. And sometimes they are even sleeping as the same time already. Not always but at least sometimes. They're even sleeping for at least 4 hour stretches at night. What they do, and I think it's so so cute. They each (mommy and daddy) pick a baby before they go to bed. Whichever one they pick is their baby for the night. If he needs fed, changed, rocked or whatever, whichever one has him that night, handles it. \n\nIt has been a learning experience for sure, having twins. I'm still young enough to be a lot of help to them (47). They are terrific parents and love and support each other so much. Thank you again for your advice, I will pass along the wise words from someone who has done it and survived lol.", "Even without the update it said she came to help with the baby and home, which usually means IN THE HOUSE", "Exactly. She even carries the bags and handles the stroller so what is the sister mom doing ? \n\nBeing a mom is hard. But that doesn't mean she should run op ragged.", "I am not an introvert AT ALL but my sister used to exhaust me. Movemovemove-gogogo every minute she was here or she would come right out and say, \"How can you guys STAND it?! You don't DO ANYTHING!!!\" We had three kids 5 years apart and one was a newborn--at what time in their lives before adulthood would kids at such different developmental ages find a plethora of things to do together they'd ALL find interesting? I mean, there's only so much to do outside the home that is fun for, say, a 3yo, an 8yo, AND a 13yo \ud83d\ude44", "As a new parent I was told that leaving your shoe purse or phone in the back is a great way for exhausted parents to remember the baby in the back. Your mom is definitely a smart person for doing that.", "I bet that was a more than acceptable substitute for them! \ud83d\ude02"]}
