The youngest of the siblings ('Ben') used to be great and husband and I used to be close with Ben. When Ben started dating his now-fiancee ('Carole'), it all turned to shit. Ben is no longer friends with the friends he had before Carole and has basically no relationship with any of the other 3 siblings (my husband included). I haven't spoken with Ben or Carole in over a year, and to say my husband and my relationship with them is non-existent would be an understatement. \n\n**Background:** Anyways, my husband and I had a rule for our wedding that you had to be vaccinated to come (we made the rule before Covid restrictions got more lax). Turns out that neither Ben nor Carole are vaccinated, to each their own. Fine, whatever not my problem.\n\nExcept the problem was that Ben kept telling *anyone* that would listen that he was going to get vaccinated, or that he had already done it (ie lying to everyones' face).\n\nAbout a month before our wedding, my husband called up Ben, because at this point, we still didn't know if Ben was attending (Carole already said she wasn't coming cause she wasn't vaxxed), and straight-up asked Ben if he was coming to the wedding. Ben told my husband that he was making an appointment that day to get vaccinated, and that my husband and I need to promise Ben that we will make a spot for him at the wedding.\n\nLong story short, Ben ended up ghosting my husband and did not come to the wedding. My husband is still hurt about it, and I'm just pissed.\n\n\\---------\n\n**Now:** Ben and Carole are now planning their wedding for this year and are in need of the contact/address information for Ben's family's side of the wedding, instead of doing what myself and another in-law did, and ask the people directly for their address, Ben/Carole asked me if they can have the addresses for the guests.\n\nI told them no, sorry but I'm not going to help them. They have treated my husband and I like absolute garbage, and I'm not going to be nice and hold their hand. They can get it themselves, or ask someone else for the information, But I am not helping them.\n\nIt has now blown up and caused arguing because 'it's not a big deal, they're just addresses' but I'm more at the point where I just don't care to help them at all. Ben has still not apologized for ghosting my husband and not coming to our wedding, so I am not really in the 'helping' mood with Ben and Carole.\n\nAITA for refusing to give the address information to Ben and Carole due to their shit treatment of my husband and I, and because they absolutely don't deserve to be helped/have their hand held?", "created_utc": 1673137444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1064fzz/aita_for_refusing_to_give_the_contact_information/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So no, not a good idea to share this info with BIL.", "My cousin got married 6 months after I did and I had HUGE anxiety giving her the addresses for mutual family members despite knowing 100% they were all on good terms.
