All four of us are students. Sally, Kyle and I are musicians, and Dave isn't. I play the flute, while Kyle is a vocalist and Sally is an electric bassist. Kyle and Sally also play fife for their summer jobs. As an added piece of context, Sally and Dave are dating.\n\nI would practice flute for 30 minutes-1 hour every couple days and have an hour long lesson weekly. At first, Dave didn't bring up any problems with it, so I assumed he was okay with me practicing.\n\nBut, in the middle of a lesson, Dave came up to my room and asked if I could do my lessons in the music building at our university. I told him I'd see what I could do. In reality, I wasn't going to do that, I just needed to figure out a way to tell him no. That would be too much work because I would have to take all of my equipment to another place just for a lesson and bring it all back right before I have work.\n\nA couple days later, I was just practicing and he interrupts me to ask if I could practice elsewhere and I, told him I'd think about it.\n\nLater that day, my housemates and I had a discussion that lasted an hour and a half to talk about this situation. Sally sided with Dave, but stayed quiet because she can practice quietly (plug headphones into her amp) and refuses to practice fife off the clock. We asked if Dave could wear headphones, but he said no because he doesn't like the way they feel on his head and got upset we were \"pushing headphones\" on him, which was only because it is the easiest solution.\n\nThe solution we reached was we would have \"loud vs quiet\" days. On loud days, we could practice at home for an hour slot, but on quiet days, we would need to practice elsewhere. Kyle and I didn't like it, but agreed to it because we could practice at home sometimes.\n\nAt first, I only practiced on loud days to \"maliciously comply\" with it, but we never set up any more weeks after the first one.\n\nThe new rule became \"practice when Dave's at work\", but I was never told that. I only heard it from Kyle after Dave and Sally decided on it. Without me. Or Kyle, as far as I know.\n\nThat rule sucks because his hours have gotten cut way back and he only works small morning shifts. I am not a morning person, and by the time I'm ready to do stuff, Dave's home. Kyle also works full-time and his schedule completely overlaps with Dave's.\n\n.Today when I got home from work, Kyle told me the new rule and we ranted about it. We both have ranted about this to a lot of our friends, and every single person we have spoken to has said Dave is being entitled. Out of all of my friends I have spoken to about this, only *one* of them was a musician.\n\nWe want to talk to Dave and Sally because we believe it is ridiculous that we can't practice in our own home without tight rules and need advice. Would we be assholes if we confronted them? If not, what should we say to them?\n\nI had to cut a lot of info, feel free to ask for more info.", "created_utc": 1688266910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14odc9d/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_friend_for_not_letting/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would imagine this is a college situation for all of you?  \nIf you are going to be quiet sometimes to help Dave get his work done he needs to be understanding sometimes to help you get your work done. So you all need to discuss this  together like humans, create a plan that allows everyone time for work and time for peace, and stick to it. You can not walk on eggshells for Dave or be psychic, but you do not have to maliciously comply if you worked out an equitable arrangement. When does he need it quiet and why?

He moved in with three musicians. Where the hell did he think you would be practicing? You absolutely should not be forced to practice somewhere else. Honestly, the amount of time you spend practicing is less than I've heard of others doing. Thirty minutes to an hour, and not even every day? He's getting off easy & just doesn't know it.", "Sally and Dave need to move out and get their own place.\n\nIt's your home.

He is not the head of the house, you are equals. \n\nWhy can\u00b4t he wear noise cancelling earbuds if he doesn\u00b4t like headphones?

If I were Dave and OP continues being a d\\*ck about it, I'd get the landlord involved. I guarantee the landlord would side with Dave.", "I'm not disagreeing at all, but what you suggested at the end is exactly the solution we came to. It only stuck for a week, though. Because of inconsistencies with other peoples' schedules, we couldn't pick specific days each week and keep them, but what we agreed to was essentially what you said, just that we had to change the days each week.\n\nAlso I don't know if you heard of \"malicious compliance\", but that's what I was referring to in my post. Should have been clearer on that, but I ran out of characters lol. Essentially it means complying with the rules perfectly in a way it fucks with the other. I only practiced during the \"loud\" days during the hour slot on those days and I didn't want to go out to practice because I didn't feel it was fair to have to go out to practice every single time I wanted to just because my one housemate, who knew he was going to live with three musicians, doesn't like it and didn't say anything for over a month. I wasn't doing anything \"extra annoying\" or \"extra bad\", just only playing on those days during the time slot. Again, sorry for not being clearer on that, that's my bad.\n\nI know you didn't say anything like this, but just in case: I have not been hostile or rude to Dave, I've just ranted about this situation to my friends and this weighs on my mind a lot. He asked me if he was being too pushy, and I said no because I didn't feel like confrontation that day. I said this in another reply but I think it was deleted, but Dave asked Kyle the same thing and Kyle said yes, then Dave yelled at him, which was exactly what I feared and exactly why I said no just to keep the peace. I haven't talked to Dave at all about this since our huge hour and a half long house meeting, I've just been practicing when times were agreed upon or when he's out and doing my lessons at home.\n\nAgain, I am not totally disagreeing. In fact, I do understand and appreciate your critiques of me and will learn from them. I can give him more leeway and I'll think about that before talking to him.", "ESH.\n\nBoth of you have easy solutions to the problem staring you in the face but both of you have decided to be selfish and refuse to compromise. Dave could wear headphones. You could get up earlier. It doesn\u2019t sound like either of you are peachy to live with.\n\nThat being said, at least the beginnings of an attempt to communicate has been made seemingly by both side. Keep working at it, or one of you needs to move if you care about salvaging the friendship. If you aren\u2019t actually friends though, one of you probably just needs to move.", "How does he pay rent?", "I'd like to just add it isn't just me being upset with Dave, it's also our other housemate, Kyle having issues too. I haven't personally said anything regarding this to Dave, which I know I should communicate better, but Kyle has. Dave asked him if he was being too pushy, Kyle said yes, then Dave yelled at him. There have also been zero neighbor complaints regarding noise (or anything) from our house.\n\nI'm not saying any of this to argue, I genuinely am listening to what you have to say in this reply and in your other comment on here and I appreciate the feedback.

He\u2019s not practicing at 3am, it\u2019s normal to expect noise during the day. OPs not being a dick for practicing the flute for less than an hour a couple times a week.

It can be really bloody annoying being forced to listen to people practicing (especially if badly). \n\nYou have no idea what your neighbours think. They haven't complained -- yet. I live in a block of flats and the people above me have a penchant for playing the piano loudly at strange times (and badly). I haven't complained yet but I am very close to complaining. Those mfs are taking the ever-loving piss with that terrible playing.\n\nI was forced to listen to incessant practicing in my childhood home but as an adult paying for my own property, I am well within my rights not to expect that sort of intrusion. \n\nFrankly, I don't care if Kyle agrees with you. Dave has a right to tell you to practice elsewhere/ refuse to wear headphones. If you and Kyle are in perfect harmony then you need to move in together - without Dave, but as long as you are living in a place where he also pays rent, it would behoove you to respect his wishes, unless you want to get the landlord involved. \n\nTbh - you sound like very selfish kids. If you are living with other people, keep your noise levels to a minimum unless they're up for all of that.", "They both pay rent. OP has no right to force anyone to listen to him practice. In most tenancy agreements there are clauses about noise making/being considerate to neighbours. Dave is well within his rights to tell OP to stfu or get the landlord involved. If OP wants to practice everyday, they shouldn't be living with anyone else.", "Actually, it's not a reasonable request. If OP wants to practice at home everyday they should pay for the privilege of their own home or live solely with fellow musicians who will understand. If Dave says something to the landlord, the landlord will most likely side with Dave.", "A tip from someone who recently changed their sleep schedule: Find a series of tasks you like to do before bed, read a book, listen to some comedy/calm music/podcast/asmr/fan-whitenoise. Do it every day. Even if you only read for 5 minutes. Or listen to the first 3 jokes in an hour special before turning it off; I would recommend earbuds, wireless if yoi can afford them.\n\nThen after a few days, try doing your routine an hour early and see if it takes. You don't have to jump into waking up at say 6am. Nothing wrong with easing into it.\n\nWhile youre at it, let Dave know you're working on being able to practice earlier so as not to bother him. But in the meantim, I'd be practicing whenever you need to.", "and that roommate has no right to force op into silence in a house he pays for. you're not getting it.", "If Dave wants perfect peace and quiet he needs to live alone and not with roommates. \n\nI would love an update of what the landlord has to say if Dave brings up this issue of noise during the day.

I'm surrounded by academics and students. People are regularly working from home into the small hours. It is basic respect to keep the noise to a minimum, irrespective of the time of day. I live next to other professors, post docs and grad students. People are ALWAYS working. You might think you're not disturbing anyone when practicing but you absolutely are. \n\nOP is in a student house, so a similar environment to mine.
