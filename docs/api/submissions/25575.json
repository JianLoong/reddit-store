So, my mom used to do all these things. To the point of cigarette smoke being a severe migraine trigger for me, as well a just making me literally gag whenever I smell it. I find smoking absolutely disgusting because of this, and I did the same thing with my boys. Would not let them around anyone who smokes or recently smoked and smells like an ash tray. Especially my mom. She didn't really have any contact with them until they were after a year old. She is also a very gross smoker though, never washes her hands/showers often and smells like a walking cigarette. My point being my mom traumatized me with smoking cigarettes. She even smoked while pregnant with me and I almost died as a baby because of this. And she still continues to smoke to this day even after her having two heart attacks. I wanted to make sure my kids never had to deal with what I went through because parents don't realize how unbreathable it is around a smoker. I could never successfully do sports either because of second hand smoke exposure and also got bullied in school for smelling like cigarettes. Sometimes you don't realize the damage that is done whether it be physical or emotional when it comes to being around others that smoke. Is it practical to keep your kids away from everything, absolutely not. But I tried, and it seems your sis is too. I eventually chilled on the matter but she may just need some reassurance and support. It sucks she's putting you through it, but it may be some sort of mental situation where she can't allow her kids to be around what she dealt with as a kid.", "YTA.

If I'm at home, sure. If I have guests? Depends on the guests - some smoke as well, other's dont. If they don't, then I can wait. If I visit other people? Depends on the hosts.

Furthermore, before anyone attempts to go off on me about car exhausts and such, saying \"this much has that too so why not allow everything?\" is bad logic.\n\n>!It's the same logic as \"I've been smoking for ten years and I don't have cancer yet, smoking is never going to give me cancer (so I'm not going to waste my money going to a doctor)\". Yet the CDC's website said 480,317 people died from any disease caused by smoking in 2009. That includes 41,284 deaths caused by various diseases obtained from secondhand smoke. If you'd like to then you can focus on the percentile and just how \"small\" the chance is that your relatives could die from secondhand smoke after you've \"been careful\". But that percentage doesn't represent the emotion damage when the unexpected happens and someone dies, or the emotional damage incurred from being the reason even accidentally for said deaths. Others will try to justify said percentiles with insults or calling this explanation \"reaching\" or \"desperate\" or \"how much smaller the chance is compared to [insert other possibility of death]\". They're usually not the ones ready to deal with any repercussions from unexpected and/or accidental deaths. In fact, while we're on numbers, let's remember that it only takes 1 death to ruin the survivors' mental health for decades and surviving the death of your kids is called one of the most unnatural things to experience.

Are there any concerns about PPD at play?  \n\nUnfortunately, your sister DOES call the shots in the end & if she continues this route, as much as it hurts, I would continue to do everything I could to be there for your niblings, in spite of this, as they're going to need your love, understanding & support even more as time goes on. \n\nYou're NTA.
