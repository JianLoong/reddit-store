Obviously to us, it was always purely platonic but in our small town, a male and female friendship as close as ours was unconventional.\n\nAndrew started dating Jess in April 2019 and they are due to get married in January. I am extremely happy for them and I\u2019m looking forward to having little babies to spoil. However, I recently found out through a mutual friend that Jess does not like me. Jess was telling my friend that she has always felt insecure about me and Andrew\u2019s friendship and thinks I have feelings for him. It was my first time hearing about this, she has always been nice and sweet when we\u2019ve met up so this came out of the blue for me. Our mutual friend advised me to not attend the wedding as to not ruin Jess\u2019 special day. I have been thinking about not going but I was named Andrew\u2019s \u2018best man\u2019 alongside his brother and I don\u2019t want to bail on him or hurt his feelings by not attending.

Now that I read you are Andrew\u2019s \u201cbest man\u201d, you should absolutely go. The wedding likely isn\u2019t going to change your dynamic.\n\nI have somebody in my life similar to Andrew. She\u2019s absolutely wonderful and my life is so much better because she\u2019s in it. In no way am I competitive to her relationship \u2013 in many ways I think I make it better. \n\nThey are going to have to learn how to make decisions as a couple. You are one of them. If you are unsure, ask them both to dinner and talk about it.", "NTA.\n\nCan\u2018t Andrew and Jess talk about it and find a solution? Seems like they should communicate SOON and CLEARLY.", "NTA have a talk w/andrew about it, see what he says. It's important that he's made aware of shit too, y'know?", "I would ask Andrew if he is aware of any upset from Jess on this, without necessarily mentioning that your friend has said that Jess has said this (because that could blow up a conflict between them that you probably don't want to set off if it can be avoided). \n\nAnd then you can talk to him about what to do about that or he can talk to Jess.\n\nI think your friend is quite wrong to say you should skip the wedding because it would 'ruin Jess's day' because she doesn't know that it would, and also because it implies that you have somehow done something wrong.\n\nAnd it *also* ignores that it would ruin Andrew's day if his best man declines to attend. Seems like your friend is stirring drama a bit.\n\nJess is the one that needs to resolve this with Andrew. If you are invited, you should accept. But also speak to Andrew. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Go to the wedding, you are his best man.   Sounds like Jess knows how he will react if she tries to say something to him given that it's her being unreasonably  jealous, so she's trying to get someone else to cause problems in your friendship.", "NTA\n\nJess is just jealous and it may or may not go away over time. If not sit down and talk about it with her or ask if Andrew knows about it. If you are still dating it will likely go away with time.", "NTA. \n\nI was in a similar situation a few years ago and not long after my \u2018Andrew\u2019 married his \u2018Jess\u2019, who seemed fine with me up until (and including) the wedding, he essentially ghosted me\u2026 after almost 20 years of friendship. I\u2019m still devastated but there\u2019s not much you can do when they\u2019ve made their choice. Kick in the guts though. \n\nI sincerely hope this isn\u2019t the case for you, of course. GL!", "Nta\nI would recommend talking to your friend Andrew and his fianc\u00e9 to clear anything in the air. Communication is going to be a major key to see if this is something that you and Andrew should reassure the fianc\u00e9 that nothing is going on. It may also be prewedding nerve that could cause it. Hopefully it\u2019s a miscommunication and things go well for you and your newly wedded friend!!", "NTA unless either Andrew or Jess requests it, and if it Jess that requests it, make sure you inform Andrew why you aren\u2019t attending.", "NTA but you have to talk with both of them they need to communicate, and you also have to understand that likely you are not going to be his number first anymore", "Y W B T A if u bailed on Andrew and your duties as 'best man' without any notice. \n\nYou seriously need to talk to him and be openly honest about the conversation Jess had with you. Don't add any person feelings or advice just the facts. I've seen girls like Jess before. Usually  their jealously makes them see things that aren't there and take things you say out of context so be careful about what you say around her.\n\nOtherwise NTA", "NTA\n\nSince you were not expressly uninvited by the couple, no reason not to go. Plus Jess is marrying your friend, how afraid of you can she be. She\u2019s tying down your friend to her now and if anything is to happen between you 2, it would have happened by now. Her insecurity is not your concern and you not showing up probably will hurt your friend more", "NTA.  If you\u2019re worried, talk to Andrew about it.", "NTA. If you\u2019re invited (and the best man, to boot) then clearly she\u2019s agreed on your attendance. Not going based on hearsay is ridiculous. \n\nBut if you\u2019re being truthful here and you really are Andrew\u2019s \u201cnumber one,\u201d then *he\u2019s* definitely an asshole that has no business getting married. And his fianc\u00e9e is an idiot for going through with this while she has (justifiable) reservations about his relationship with you. \n\nIt\u2019s you two against the world? (To include her?) You\u2019re his \u201cnumber one?\u201d Yeah, I would bet good money that either their marriage or your friendship is going to implode before it\u2019s all said and done.", "NTA if you go.\n\nMutual 'friend' is not a friend at all. Also: if Jess is so against you going, she needs to talk to hubby about that, not complain to said 'friend'.\nYou didn't hear anything through the soon to be newly-weds. If you want, you can try to have a talk with them about how they feel about the whole situation. Or you can just ignore stupid pot-stirring 'friend'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is his special day too, be there for your friend.", "NTA - And at the moment, this is nothing but heresay. You need to speak to Andrew and Jess about this.\n\nI know how difficult it is when your best friend is of the opposite sex and you live in a closed minded place.\n\nHad the same best mate since 1987 and it would be like getting with a sibling, and he VERY much feels the same.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re his best friend and it\u2019s his day too. If he wants you there then you have every right to be there.", "NTA you're only hearing this secondhand and it could be the mutual friend trying to stir up drama. You don't know, maybe the friend kept pushing Jess about this but she doesn't have strong feelings either way.", "NTA. I wouldn't say anything to the couple unless something is said to you first. Mutual friend's input is valued, but should be taken with a grain of salt. Even if it is true that she doesn't like you, it's possible this is something they're already working on behind closed doors and you bringing it up unprompted could exacerbate a potential non-issue. I think your best bet here is to say nothing, act oblivious, be kind to her as long as she is kind/civil to you, and let your friend deal with this on his own. You don't have to do anything other than show up if invited (idk if they've sent invites or what) or don't if not.", "NTA, but talk to friend and explain what is going on.", "NTA. If you're not wanted, let Jess and Andrew tell you.", "NTA. I think you need to speak to Andrew and explain your dilemma. I think it would be helpful to speak with Jess too (once you have spoken to Andrew maybe) and reassure her that Andrew is like a brother for you, and yes you love him and yes you have feelings for him but as a sister would have for her brother, nothing else.", "Nta\n\nIf she has a problem with you that is something she needs to take up with her fianc\u00e9. Chances are they have already discussed you at length before he made the decision to make you best man. Go to the wedding and celebrate your best friend.", "NTA I do think you should have a conversation with Jess about why she feels like this and to assure her that you and Andrew are best friends and nothing more.", "NTA, I\u2019m not sure if the idea to skip the wedding is Jess\u2019 or your mutual friend\u2019s but if she goes behind Andrew\u2018s and your back to get you to skip the wedding, that\u2019s her problem and a red flag. Andrew wants you there and you would hurt *his* feelings if you didn\u2019t attend. If it\u2019s solely the mutual friend\u2019s idea, they should mind their own business. \n\nTbh, I would bring this up with Andrew and Jess. If Jess is being manipulative, Andrew should know. If the mutual friend is being manipulative, Jess should know. \n\n(Full disclosure, most of my close friends are men and if a boyfriend ever had a problem with any of them, that\u2019d be the end of the relationship.)", "NTA, don't mind them, you tell this friend that they need to mind their own business and that it's Andrew's big day too, you'd ruin it for them if you didn't show up.\n\nI'm petty enough I would tell Andrew that his bride to be is using people as an in-between to ask me not to come to the wedding.", "**NTA**. If Andrew wants you there, that's all that matters. Fuck Jess for being so insecure and fuck the friend who told you not to go so you don't ruin her day. Last I checked, it's also the groom's day. He clearly wants you there since he made you his Best Man. You're there for him, not her. DO NOT BAIL.", "Yeah, this is definitely something Andrew should be made aware of. \n\n\nRegardless of the genders of the friends, or a potential sexual aspect to it, people should always be made aware that their potential spouse is putting pressure (intentionally or not) on their friends to not attend their wedding , or even just not liking their friends. \n\nThat\u2019s definitely something that needs to be addressed before the wedding.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but I meant it as, even if we have other friends or are in different circles, we\u2019re still each other\u2019s best friends or number one friend. We\u2019ve always been respectful of boundaries when we\u2019ve been in relationships and other than jealousy fits by two of my exes, we\u2019ve never had a problem with our friendship that I know of until now.", "Well that\u2019s good to hear. But if I were you, I would look at your language here if you want to understand why his fianc\u00e9e might not be comfortable. Especially if you want to make this dynamic work long term. \n\nThere\u2019s the whole borderline disrespectful \u201cit\u2019s us against the world\u201d speech you made here, but did you even realize how you somehow managed to reduce her entire presence in his life to nothing more than an incubator of babies for you to play with? I *highly* doubt that \u201cgiving my husband and his platonic life partner babies to play with\u201d is a feature of this girl\u2019s vision for marriage or motherhood. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t mean \u201cI\u2019m the real number one in his life\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s me and your husband against the world and you\u2019re only useful for pushing out babies,\u201d it\u2019s what she\u2019s likely going to interpret those types of comments as. I think you need to stop writing other people\u2019s perspective off as small town biases and consider whether or not you just suck at communication. (And if you do, don\u2019t feel bad. Most people do unless they work on it.) People can\u2019t read your mind, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether you know it\u2019s platonic or not. What matters is if the fianc\u00e9e thinks shit like \u201cIt\u2019s me and him against the world,\u201d is platonic."]}
