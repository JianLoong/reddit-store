Even if it is true that she doesn't like you, it's possible this is something they're already working on behind closed doors and you bringing it up unprompted could exacerbate a potential non-issue.

Andrew wants you there and you would hurt *his* feelings if you didn\u2019t attend. If it\u2019s solely the mutual friend\u2019s idea, they should mind their own business. \n\nTbh, I would bring this up with Andrew and Jess. If Jess is being manipulative, Andrew should know.

Especially if you want to make this dynamic work long term. \n\nThere\u2019s the whole borderline disrespectful \u201cit\u2019s us against the world\u201d speech you made here, but did you even realize how you somehow managed to reduce her entire presence in his life to nothing more than an incubator of babies for you to play with?

I think you need to stop writing other people\u2019s perspective off as small town biases and consider whether or not you just suck at communication. (And if you do, don\u2019t feel bad. Most people do unless they work on it.) People can\u2019t read your mind, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether you know it\u2019s platonic or not.

She\u2019ll get over her insecurities eventually.", "This is a tricky one, if you bail without any explanation, you'll probably lose him as a friend, if you talk to him about it, it may ruin his relationship and he'd be put in a tough spot and have to choose between the 2 of you and possibly lose him as a friend. The best way would be to talk to both of them in person and not make any decision just based on hear say. NTA whatever you decide.", "NTA. Even assuming the mutual friend is reliable and not someone looking to cause drama, Jess needs to learn to use her words to communicate. Add. It would be inappropriate for you to go and disappear if you'd already agreed to participate in the wedding.", "NTA.  You were asked to be apart of the wedding by Andrew.  It is his special day too and he deserves to have the people he cares about there.\n\nAlso, unless you hear directly from Jess\u2019 mouth that she doesn\u2019t like you, don\u2019t worry about it!", "NTA dont take it so much to heart when you didnt hear it from the source. Your mutual friend was wrong to meddle. And did it occur to you it might actually be the mutual friends feelings about your relationship, not Jess\u2019s?Jess might have just been Venting some insecurities while knowing full well how you two feel about each other. There is no shame in her being a bit insecure. Andrew and jess might talk about her feelings regularly, and thats fine. \nIt does not mean she does not like you, it does not mean she does not want you there, it does not mean you will ruin her day if you come to the wedding. She is a grown woman and if something bothers her she can come to you. \nIf you have doubt, talk to her or andrew or both of them directly, but dont think for others and dont judge Jess based on what someone says she said about you.

Just give Andrew a heads up beforehand that you intend to ask his fiance for a hang.", "Absolutely. Andrew wants OP there. If Jess has an issue with that, that's between them. OP shouldn't be losing sleep over her bestie asking her to be a best person. Seems natural that he would ask that.", "NTA\n\n\nIf Jess has a problem with you being at the wedding that's between her and Andrew....your mutual friend needs to butt out.\n\nAlso part of Jess issues us the way you describe your relationship with Andrew. Your language basically evicts her out of her futures husband's life. You need to tone it down. You also need to realize he will be putting his wife first. It's his wife. You're his friend. That's not the same level OP.", "NTA. You don't even know for sure if what the mutual friend said is accurate. If Jess has an issue, she needs to bring it up with Andrew.

Then go and be happy for your friend and polite to his wife.", "Info: How much you trust this friend? Did Jess say that she doesn't like you or just that she feels intimidated by your friendship (tbh, it's not a valid concern, but it's an understandable one. It's so ingrained in us that our partner should be our \"best friend\" that some people are jealous of same-sex friends). Talk to Andrew and find out if Jess shared anything similar with him. If not, it might just be a fear she understands as irrational, but cannot get rid of. So she confided in a close friend who created an unnecessary drama.

If you're a co-best man, you need to go. Honestly, I don't think you were supposed to know about Jess's feelings.

Get her used to the fact that you're in his life and not going anywhere. She might just start trusting you.", "I'm wondering if Jess is trying to avoid a difficult conversation with Andrew by circumventing him and using the mutual friend to get OP out of the picture.  She doesn't just want OP's relationship with her fiance to lessen in intensity, which might be reasonable.  She wants her gone.", "Jess didn't tell OP anything, she is hearing about this through a third party. Jess didn't even say she didn't want OP at the wedding, the third party is suggesting it.

Not Jess. Maybe Jess dislikes OP as much as the friend said, maybe the friend's exaggerating how much she dislikes her. But Jess has the right to her feelings, as long as she doesn't do anything about them other than venting to a friend. She didn't ask OP to do anything, certainly didn't ask her to miss the wedding, and she's always nice to OP. The friend's a shit stirrer, and she should have kept their mouth shut. \n\nOP can decide if she wants to speak to Jess and Andrew about this, but I wouldn't miss the wedding of my best friend because of someone's gossip, and I don't think it be fair to anyone.

I\u2019m uncomfortable though, because I\u2019ve heard some gossip that people are inferring that Andrew and I are more than friends.  Geez, that is so far from the truth.

It\u2019s not just Jess\u2019s day but also also Andrew\u2019s day too. If Andrew has asked you to be his \u201dbest man\u201d then it\u2019s clearly incredibly important for you to be there. He not only once you at the wedding, but he once you involved.\n\nNTA. Just needs to be a big girl and have an adult conversation with you and Andrew if she really thinks there\u2019s an issue. But also her insecurities are no one\u2019s responsibility for her own.", "Exactly. This is not OP\u2019s problem to solve. Andrew needs to have a talk with his fianc\u00e9e. Like now.", "Jess didn\u2019t ask that OP be disinvited, the friend talking OP advised she doesn\u2019t come.", "But even if Jess requests it but Andrew still wants OP to be there\u2026 it\u2019s not on OP to figure it out. That\u2019s between Andrew and Jess. It\u2019s not just the brides day but it\u2019s also the grooms day too.", "Jess didn\u2019t have any conversation with OP. Jess vented to a friend and that friend is the one advising OP not to come to the wedding.", "I know, but I think this should be worked out before the wedding because Jess probably still feels this way and just doesn\u2019t want to cause problems.", "This is a very good point. It is perfectly possible that Jess is fine with you but the mutual friend doesn\u2019t believe in platonic friendship and thinks you should bow out", "You\u2019ve never vented your insecurities to a friend? For all we know it might have been a nonchalant \u201cyeah sometimes it makes me insecure OP thinks she\u2019s the number one in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s life\u201d comment and the friend made it seem bigger than it was. It\u2019s not worth bringing up a conversation over.", "NTA - You are hearing about Jess's angst third person through their interpretation of what was said. Jess is maybe a little anxious about your friendship, however, give her credit for sucking it up and being friendly with you and especially since you are one of the best men.", "NTA\u2026.go to your best friends wedding. Also just as a note, if Jess has never spoken to you about this anything said was hearsay\u2026so imagine telling your best friend that you\u2019re not coming based on some gossip. The only thing I might do is maybe mention this convo to him just to check in. Either there isn\u2019t a problem or there is a problem and important people are being left out of that convo.", "NAH. \n\nTry to put some thought into your wedding gift, if you can. Maybe a his and hers gift, or something with both of their initials on them - essentially, something that screams, \"You two belong together!\"", "NTA.  Talk to Andrew and let him know what is going on.", "If Andrew made you a part of the wedding party, it's safe to assume he's cleared that with his bride. \n\nYour mutual is out of line\n\nGo, and have a glorious time celebrating your friends\n\nNTA", "NTA. Think of how sad Andrew would be if you didn\u2019t show up. That\u2019s your bro. You need to be there for him. His wife is gonna have to understand that friendship can absolutely exist between men and women without underlying romantic feelings.", "NTA and don\u2019t rely on rumors. If Jess is really concerned, she will either talk to Andrew or talk to you directly. \n\nIf you bail, Andrew will be hurt and ask why- and then he will be made as Jess if that rumor\nIs even true. That certainly isn\u2019t going to improve their wedding day. \n\nYou were invited, you accepted, so go and be supportive. Be sure to tell her how happy you are that your buddy found such a great woman to love. If you show respect for her stated boundaries and are mindful about your interactions with Andrew, she will hopefully come around and see you as a friend/sister/aunt rather than a threat.", "NTA and maybe I'm the odd man out but I would invite Jess to have an actual conversation about her feelings. Express that it's been brought to your attention that Jess might not be as comfortable with your relationship with Andrew and you had thought and you wanted to clear the air and assure her outright that you have no romantic in her fianc\u00e9 and that while he is your best friend you understand that she is his partner and should of course be the \"number 1\" woman in his life and that you hope that you can all three have a great relationship moving forward", "N T A\n\nSpeak will Jess and clear the air. Tell her your relationship is not one she needs to fear nor be insecure about. Reassure her you only have good intentions and look forward supporting and celebrating their marriage as a couple. Feel free to add the spoiling their kids part and any other honest and sincere things you feel. \n\nIf there\u2019s still a problem it\u2019s on her and you did your due diligence.", "NTA \n\nMy 2c, \nGo out with Jess and Andrew and tell them together that you guys have been best friends for X years, your glad he found his soulmate and your passing her the torch of being his best friend. \nYou'll always be there for him / them and love your friendship, but know that marriage will change your relationship and you want them to know you are so excited for their new adventure. \n\nAnd then you need to give them some space. Because regardless of your relationship with him... If she's feeling threatened (justified or not) you'll be cut out of that friendship. \n\nBoy girl best friend relationships shouldn't be this complicated... But they unfortunately often are. \n\nI'll bet in some time it'll all level. But his wife is going to need to feel like she's not having a power struggle.", "NTA \n\nTalk to your friend and his fianc\u00e9. You don\u2019t know if the \u201cthird party\u201d is telling the truth. Sounds like gossip. Just be open and honest with your friend to clear the air.", "I have been you. I learned a slightly manipulative thing to do that helps.\n\nInvite both to hang out. Make her your focus. Walk next to her, chat with her and ask questions. Don't ignore friend but work on making her comfortable with you.\n\nWhen you aren't constantly talking with friend, especially about things she wasn't a part of or interested in you make her the third wheel and all she sees is your connection. Whe. You focus on her, your connection to friend isn't as glaring. \n\nPlus, you get to know her, have experiences with her that mean you may find things in common with her. And maybe become friends in your own right.\n\nSo, maybe give that a try. And do NOT tell friend you are doing it. Just hang with both of them and get to know her. Also, i don't know if you have apartner, but if you do recommend a couples day. Letting her see you are looking elsewhere will also help", "NTA.", "NTA and you should absolutely go. Andrew wants you there and asked you to be in the wedding party. He would have surely talked to Jess before even asking you. It would be wrong to bail at this point and not attend. If Jess is feeling this insecure, Andrew needs to address that with her. How reliable is your source anyway? I wonder if that person seriously misunderstood something Jess said.", "I also wonder if Jess even said it. Or if she was just venting to a friend who then decided to spread gossip. If Jess is actually concerned, she could\nTalk to Andrew or OP directly.", "For real OP go to the wedding especially if you're his best man. When I got married to my wife I had my best friend keely as my best man. My wife loves her and knows we've known each other decades and was cool with it. And my wife and i have been together 9 years and married 7. Men and women can be just friends believe it or not", "You don\u2019t know that. OP heard a rumor. Jess could be just as innocent as OP here. Don\u2019t act on rumor- it just makes problems bigger.", "Or the someone else came up with that on their own and Jess never requested anything.", "She might not actually feel that way. The \u201cmutual friend\u201d was gossiping. Even if Jess has an insecurity, she is already handling it and treating OP with kindness. If Jess is concerned, she can bring it up with OP directly. OP should continue to support them both and ignore gossip.", "Maybe. But also maybe the \u201cmutual friend\u201d\nIs just a gossip who speculated or blew an off hand comment from Jess way out of proportion. \n\nI\u2019d caution OP not to over-react, and not to cast Jess as the jealous girlfriend without more than a side comment from a third party.", "[removed]", "Keep in mind that OP hasn\u2019t heard anything directly from Jess at all. Jess might have just voiced a minor insecurity and the \u201cmutual friend\u201d took it upon herself to tell OP not to come. That person needs to stay out of it. If Jess actually is concerned, she needs to talk to Op or at least Andrew directly. But she might not feel that way at all.", "I'm glad someone else pointed this out. Who's the friend? Are they a drama llama? Is there any indication from anyone else that Jess has a problem with OP? OP needs to talk to Andrew or Jess or both before taking this third-party shit- stirring as gospel.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. It's all coming from someone else who may have their own agenda. As you said, unless you hear otherwise from Jess or Andrew then carry on as usual.", "Please be aware that what you heard was gossip. Jess may have just vented an insecurity and never intended anything to come of it. The \u201cmutual friend\u201d is the one who is shit-stirring. If Jess had a problem with you even attending the wedding, she would have talked about that with Andrew when he chose you to be his \u201cbest man\u201d. \n\nTake the gossip and throw it out. If Jess actually has a problem, she will need to address it directly or with Andrew. But I suggest you assume the best intentions and make sure to include her in future activities. Tell her how glad you are that she and Andrew make each other so happy. Be supportive of their relationship. If she sees you as a supporter rather than a threat, you\u2019ll both prove the insecurity and the busybody friend wrong.", "Jesus Christ is was a goddamn voice to text typo.

Sometimes people just aggressive for no reason other than it makes them feel better about their lives.", "NTA\nJust be warned, that \u201cfriend\u201d who told you this might intentionally be trying to destroy your relationship with Andrew by bullshitting drama. I\u2019ve seen it in my life, so it could be happening here too.", "NTA. I (female) have a male best friend and was a groomsmaid in his wedding. And I'm sure, because we were in our mid-twenties, that there were some drama mongers who thought it was inappropriate and talked crap about it.\n\nNow, over 10 years later he's still my best friend, but so is his wife. He actually will remind her that I was his friend first \ud83e\udd23 He goes to shows with my husband and we regularly have family dinner with all of our kids. \n\nIt's possible to be friends with the opposite sex. As you grow, so will your friendship to include space for the new people you bring into your lives.", "NTA.  Go and support Andrew.  He asked you to be his \"best man\" so you absolutely should go.", "NTA\n\nAndrew wants you there, and Jess accepts you being there (otherwise you would not be in the wedding party). Be there for your bestie, just realize that your relationship will change. \n\nReach out to Jess and try to make a relationship with her. Let her see that you have no interest in Andrew beyond wanting him happy. Do stuff just with her, if she is OK with it.", "NTA - don't assume that a second-hand comment is correct. There's lots of room for gossip and misrepresentation. If Jess has a problem, she can tell you so herself, better yet, she can communicate that to her partner. IF there is an issue, THEY need to talk about it and come up with a solution like an adult couple.", "NTA at all. Your friend's wife will have to learn with time that you are good friends and maybe offer yourself to be the babysitter as you say you want to spoil the kids \ud83e\udd23 ok #justkidding\n\nThe wedding is the groom's special day too and he deserves to have his best friends there too. It's not only about the bride. So be there for him to. \n\nJust respect the couple's space and wish them a happy life.", "NTA.  You should attend the wedding to show both Andrew and the bride that you fully support their marriage.  Who knows what the mutual friend said is true or blown out of proportion.    I think you should mention to Andrew what you've been told and let him and Jess work it out.  If it turns out all to be a bunch of baloney from the mutual friend - Andrew would be really upset that you didn't show up and Jess would think that you don't support their marriage.  This would likely tarnish your relationship with them.  Good luck!", "Does Andrew have any idea about how Jess feels?  She didn't pressure Andrew to cut OP from the wedding, she backchanneled a request through a mutual friend that was not Andrew.  OP should probably talk to Andrew about this as he may be heading for a marriage to someone who has plans to \"fix\" him rather than someone who loves him for who he is.", "As someone else pointed out, this is just hearsay and it may or may not be true that Jess feels this way. \n\nDo you and Jess have anything in common, that you could do without Andrew being there? So you could bond more. Talk about guys you are dating and ask her for advice. \n\nBut since you will most likely make a speech at the wedding, prioritise what you say. That you are so happy that Andrew found Jess, how she\u2019s the perfect woman for him etc. How you are looking forward to them having kids (hoping that they take after Jess), how lucky you are that you got Jess as a bonus sister-in-law. \n\nYou get the picture.", "Definitely might not be true. But it wouldn't be the first insecure wife with a husband who has a female best friend. It's a common trope on relationship boards.", "Yeah. Or even if it wasn't nonchalant, it could be something Jess knows is irrational and is trying to work through on her own/with support of her friends. Hell, for all we know it's something she HAS discussed with Andrew and she okayed OP as his best man despite whatever private insecurities she has. \n\nWhatever the case, OP definitely shouldn't skip her best friend's wedding on the advice of some busy-body mutual friend."]}
