Now that I read you are Andrew\u2019s \u201cbest man\u201d, you should absolutely go. The wedding likely isn\u2019t going to change your dynamic.\n\nI have somebody in my life similar to Andrew. She\u2019s absolutely wonderful and my life is so much better because she\u2019s in it. In no way am I competitive to her relationship \u2013 in many ways I think I make it better. \n\nThey are going to have to learn how to make decisions as a couple. You are one of them.

Seems like they should communicate SOON and CLEARLY.", "NTA have a talk w/andrew about it, see what he says. It's important that he's made aware of shit too, y'know?", "I would ask Andrew if he is aware of any upset from Jess on this, without necessarily mentioning that your friend has said that Jess has said this (because that could blow up a conflict between them that you probably don't want to set off if it can be avoided). \n\nAnd then you can talk to him about what to do about that or he can talk to Jess.\n\nI think your friend is quite wrong to say you should skip the wedding because it would 'ruin Jess's day' because she doesn't know that it would, and also because it implies that you have somehow done something wrong.\n\nAnd it *also* ignores that it would ruin Andrew's day if his best man declines to attend. Seems like your friend is stirring drama a bit.\n\nJess is the one that needs to resolve this with Andrew. If you are invited, you should accept. But also speak to Andrew. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Go to the wedding, you are his best man.   Sounds like Jess knows how he will react if she tries to say something to him given that it's her being unreasonably  jealous, so she's trying to get someone else to cause problems in your friendship.", "NTA\n\nJess is just jealous and it may or may not go away over time. If not sit down and talk about it with her or ask if Andrew knows about it. If you are still dating it will likely go away with time.", "NTA. \n\nI was in a similar situation a few years ago and not long after my \u2018Andrew\u2019 married his \u2018Jess\u2019, who seemed fine with me up until (and including) the wedding, he essentially ghosted me\u2026 after almost 20 years of friendship. I\u2019m still devastated but there\u2019s not much you can do when they\u2019ve made their choice. Kick in the guts though. \n\nI sincerely hope this isn\u2019t the case for you, of course. GL!", "Nta\nI would recommend talking to your friend Andrew and his fianc\u00e9 to clear anything in the air. Communication is going to be a major key to see if this is something that you and Andrew should reassure the fianc\u00e9 that nothing is going on. It may also be prewedding nerve that could cause it. Hopefully it\u2019s a miscommunication and things go well for you and your newly wedded friend!!", "NTA unless either Andrew or Jess requests it, and if it Jess that requests it, make sure you inform Andrew why you aren\u2019t attending.", "NTA but you have to talk with both of them they need to communicate, and you also have to understand that likely you are not going to be his number first anymore", "Y W B T A if u bailed on Andrew and your duties as 'best man' without any notice. \n\nYou seriously need to talk to him and be openly honest about the conversation Jess had with you. Don't add any person feelings or advice just the facts. I've seen girls like Jess before. Usually  their jealously makes them see things that aren't there and take things you say out of context so be careful about what you say around her.\n\nOtherwise NTA", "NTA\n\nSince you were not expressly uninvited by the couple, no reason not to go. Plus Jess is marrying your friend, how afraid of you can she be. She\u2019s tying down your friend to her now and if anything is to happen between you 2, it would have happened by now. Her insecurity is not your concern and you not showing up probably will hurt your friend more", "NTA.  If you\u2019re worried, talk to Andrew about it.", "NTA. If you\u2019re invited (and the best man, to boot) then clearly she\u2019s agreed on your attendance.

And his fianc\u00e9e is an idiot for going through with this while she has (justifiable) reservations about his relationship with you. \n\nIt\u2019s you two against the world? (To include her?) You\u2019re his \u201cnumber one?\u201d Yeah, I would bet good money that either their marriage or your friendship is going to implode before it\u2019s all said and done.", "NTA if you go.\n\nMutual 'friend' is not a friend at all. Also: if Jess is so against you going, she needs to talk to hubby about that, not complain to said 'friend'.\nYou didn't hear anything through the soon to be newly-weds. If you want, you can try to have a talk with them about how they feel about the whole situation. Or you can just ignore stupid pot-stirring 'friend'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is his special day too, be there for your friend.", "NTA - And at the moment, this is nothing but heresay. You need to speak to Andrew and Jess about this.\n\nI know how difficult it is when your best friend is of the opposite sex and you live in a closed minded place.\n\nHad the same best mate since 1987 and it would be like getting with a sibling, and he VERY much feels the same.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re his best friend and it\u2019s his day too. If he wants you there then you have every right to be there.", "NTA you're only hearing this secondhand and it could be the mutual friend trying to stir up drama. You don't know, maybe the friend kept pushing Jess about this but she doesn't have strong feelings either way.", "NTA. I wouldn't say anything to the couple unless something is said to you first. Mutual friend's input is valued, but should be taken with a grain of salt. Even if it is true that she doesn't like you, it's possible this is something they're already working on behind closed doors and you bringing it up unprompted could exacerbate a potential non-issue. I think your best bet here is to say nothing, act oblivious, be kind to her as long as she is kind/civil to you, and let your friend deal with this on his own. You don't have to do anything other than show up if invited (idk if they've sent invites or what) or don't if not.", "NTA, but talk to friend and explain what is going on.", "NTA. If you're not wanted, let Jess and Andrew tell you.", "NTA. I think you need to speak to Andrew and explain your dilemma. I think it would be helpful to speak with Jess too (once you have spoken to Andrew maybe) and reassure her that Andrew is like a brother for you, and yes you love him and yes you have feelings for him but as a sister would have for her brother, nothing else.", "Nta\n\nIf she has a problem with you that is something she needs to take up with her fianc\u00e9. Chances are they have already discussed you at length before he made the decision to make you best man. Go to the wedding and celebrate your best friend.", "NTA I do think you should have a conversation with Jess about why she feels like this and to assure her that you and Andrew are best friends and nothing more.", "NTA, I\u2019m not sure if the idea to skip the wedding is Jess\u2019 or your mutual friend\u2019s but if she goes behind Andrew\u2018s and your back to get you to skip the wedding, that\u2019s her problem and a red flag. Andrew wants you there and you would hurt *his* feelings if you didn\u2019t attend. If it\u2019s solely the mutual friend\u2019s idea, they should mind their own business. \n\nTbh, I would bring this up with Andrew and Jess. If Jess is being manipulative, Andrew should know. If the mutual friend is being manipulative, Jess should know. \n\n(Full disclosure, most of my close friends are men and if a boyfriend ever had a problem with any of them, that\u2019d be the end of the relationship.)", "NTA, don't mind them, you tell this friend that they need to mind their own business and that it's Andrew's big day too, you'd ruin it for them if you didn't show up.\n\nI'm petty enough I would tell Andrew that his bride to be is using people as an in-between to ask me not to come to the wedding.", "**NTA**. If Andrew wants you there, that's all that matters. Fuck Jess for being so insecure and fuck the friend who told you not to go so you don't ruin her day. Last I checked, it's also the groom's day. He clearly wants you there since he made you his Best Man. You're there for him, not her. DO NOT BAIL.", "Yeah, this is definitely something Andrew should be made aware of. \n\n\nRegardless of the genders of the friends, or a potential sexual aspect to it, people should always be made aware that their potential spouse is putting pressure (intentionally or not) on their friends to not attend their wedding , or even just not liking their friends. \n\nThat\u2019s definitely something that needs to be addressed before the wedding.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying but I meant it as, even if we have other friends or are in different circles, we\u2019re still each other\u2019s best friends or number one friend. We\u2019ve always been respectful of boundaries when we\u2019ve been in relationships and other than jealousy fits by two of my exes, we\u2019ve never had a problem with our friendship that I know of until now.", "Well that\u2019s good to hear. But if I were you, I would look at your language here if you want to understand why his fianc\u00e9e might not be comfortable. Especially if you want to make this dynamic work long term. \n\nThere\u2019s the whole borderline disrespectful \u201cit\u2019s us against the world\u201d speech you made here, but did you even realize how you somehow managed to reduce her entire presence in his life to nothing more than an incubator of babies for you to play with? I *highly* doubt that \u201cgiving my husband and his platonic life partner babies to play with\u201d is a feature of this girl\u2019s vision for marriage or motherhood. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t mean \u201cI\u2019m the real number one in his life\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s me and your husband against the world and you\u2019re only useful for pushing out babies,\u201d it\u2019s what she\u2019s likely going to interpret those types of comments as. I think you need to stop writing other people\u2019s perspective off as small town biases and consider whether or not you just suck at communication. (And if you do, don\u2019t feel bad. Most people do unless they work on it.) People can\u2019t read your mind, so it doesn\u2019t matter whether you know it\u2019s platonic or not. What matters is if the fianc\u00e9e thinks stuff like \u201cIt\u2019s me and him against the world,\u201d is platonic.\n\nEdit: Changed \u201cshit\u201d to \u201cstuff\u201d because I have a potty mouth and, ironically, decided it probably sounds more aggressive to other people than it does to me", "NTA to go, would be to ditch Andrew. But you\u2019ve gotta get your head around that now it\u2019s Andrew and Jess against the world, she\u2019s his number one. \n\nAnd it sounds like you have a bit of emotional distance between you and Jess? If you want to be the beloved honorary aunt, you\u2019ll need to \u201cwoo\u201d her more than it sounds you have in the past. Make sure she knows you\u2019re glad that she\u2019s making Andrew-whom-you-love-like-a-brother happy.", "YWNBTA. \n\nAndrew wants you there in a major supporting role. Just do it.\n\nDon\u2019t talk to either of them about it. Weddings need less drama, not more. Don\u2019t let this mutual friend\u2019s inappropriate revealing of Jen\u2019s insecurity lead to anything at all, except the following:\n\nThink about ways you can assuage her doubts about you subtlety but clearly. If you\u2019re giving a toast, praise her and praise Andrew for picking a good one. Since you are genuinely happy for both of them, express that loud and clear. She\u2019ll get over her insecurities eventually.", "This is a tricky one, if you bail without any explanation, you'll probably lose him as a friend, if you talk to him about it, it may ruin his relationship and he'd be put in a tough spot and have to choose between the 2 of you and possibly lose him as a friend. The best way would be to talk to both of them in person and not make any decision just based on hear say. NTA whatever you decide.", "NTA. Even assuming the mutual friend is reliable and not someone looking to cause drama, Jess needs to learn to use her words to communicate. Add. It would be inappropriate for you to go and disappear if you'd already agreed to participate in the wedding.", "NTA.  You were asked to be apart of the wedding by Andrew.  It is his special day too and he deserves to have the people he cares about there.\n\nAlso, unless you hear directly from Jess\u2019 mouth that she doesn\u2019t like you, don\u2019t worry about it!", "NTA dont take it so much to heart when you didnt hear it from the source. Your mutual friend was wrong to meddle. And did it occur to you it might actually be the mutual friends feelings about your relationship, not Jess\u2019s?Jess might have just been Venting some insecurities while knowing full well how you two feel about each other. There is no shame in her being a bit insecure. Andrew and jess might talk about her feelings regularly, and thats fine. \nIt does not mean she does not like you, it does not mean she does not want you there, it does not mean you will ruin her day if you come to the wedding. She is a grown woman and if something bothers her she can come to you. \nIf you have doubt, talk to her or andrew or both of them directly, but dont think for others and dont judge Jess based on what someone says she said about you. Check the facts.", "Sounds like you need to have coffee with Jess to clear the air. I mean you're excited for them to have babies together, that's so cute, I think you can win her over. Or maybe it's old news that's not even relevant anymore and your mutual friend is just stirring up shit. Just give Andrew a heads up beforehand that you intend to ask his fiance for a hang.", "Absolutely. Andrew wants OP there. If Jess has an issue with that, that's between them. OP shouldn't be losing sleep over her bestie asking her to be a best person. Seems natural that he would ask that.", "NTA\n\n\nIf Jess has a problem with you being at the wedding that's between her and Andrew....your mutual friend needs to butt out.\n\nAlso part of Jess issues us the way you describe your relationship with Andrew. Your language basically evicts her out of her futures husband's life. You need to tone it down. You also need to realize he will be putting his wife first. It's his wife. You're his friend. That's not the same level OP.", "NTA. You don't even know for sure if what the mutual friend said is accurate. If Jess has an issue, she needs to bring it up with Andrew. It's not your responsibility to accommodate something you weren't asked to accommodate.", "You have to raise your concerns with Andrew and he and Jess must hash it out.", "NTA did you get an invitation?  Then go and be happy for your friend and polite to his wife.", "Info: How much you trust this friend? Did Jess say that she doesn't like you or just that she feels intimidated by your friendship (tbh, it's not a valid concern, but it's an understandable one. It's so ingrained in us that our partner should be our \"best friend\" that some people are jealous of same-sex friends). Talk to Andrew and find out if Jess shared anything similar with him. If not, it might just be a fear she understands as irrational, but cannot get rid of. So she confided in a close friend who created an unnecessary drama. Especially since she is nice to you.", "**NTA** \n\nThe third party may not have her facts straight. It would be wrong of you to let down your friend.", "YWNBTA. If you're a co-best man, you need to go. Honestly, I don't think you were supposed to know about Jess's feelings. I suspect this is a case of Jess venting and your mutual friend overstepping and trying to \"fix\" something they were told about in confidence.", "Right!  \nAlso, next time you and Andrew hang out, invite her along. Get her used to the fact that you're in his life and not going anywhere. She might just start trusting you.", "I'm wondering if Jess is trying to avoid a difficult conversation with Andrew by circumventing him and using the mutual friend to get OP out of the picture.  She doesn't just want OP's relationship with her fiance to lessen in intensity, which might be reasonable.  She wants her gone.", "Jess didn't tell OP anything, she is hearing about this through a third party. Jess didn't even say she didn't want OP at the wedding, the third party is suggesting it. OP needs to clear the air without the other friend meddling.", "Time out: OP heard from a third party that Jess is jealous and mad and she shouldn\u2019t go to the wedding. \n\nOP, you don\u2019t know that any of this is actually true. You don\u2019t know the words that were said, the circumstances or the conversation around the words. All you know is that someone things Jess has a problem with you. \n\nDo not take any of this with a grain of salt unless it comes straight from Jess or Andrew.", "But here's the deal: assuming the mutual friend is reliable, they are still the ones suggesting OP skips the wedding. Not Jess. Maybe Jess dislikes OP as much as the friend said, maybe the friend's exaggerating how much she dislikes her. But Jess has the right to her feelings, as long as she doesn't do anything about them other than venting to a friend. She didn't ask OP to do anything, certainly didn't ask her to miss the wedding, and she's always nice to OP. The friend's a shit stirrer, and she should have kept their mouth shut. \n\nOP can decide if she wants to speak to Jess and Andrew about this, but I wouldn't miss the wedding of my best friend because of someone's gossip, and I don't think it be fair to anyone. To OP, to Andrew or to Jess, who then would get blamed for it.", "Yup this. Some people just like to stir the pot.\n\nEta: like, you're his best man. What's there to be jealous of?", "100 percent."]}
