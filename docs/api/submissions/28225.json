OP is telling SIL that she should hold off with that line of criticism until she has  paid back her honeymoon, which in its late and unpaid state, is currently an unearned gift.  \n\nSIL is exactly the spoiled brat she's accusing OP of raising.  It's absolutely fair to tell someone to save their criticisms of your financial choices and parenting choices until after they've paid back the money they owe you. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe is clearly jealous of your life and is finding anything and I mean anything to tear you down. Anyone knows a three year old will have a difficult time understanding why they are being left out.

Unless he otherwise said exclusively to keep it between the two of you. Her reaction seems to imply she knew. If she had no knowledge then continue to fight and claim that what you are saying is false. Especially since she wants to pick a fight as seen by her comments towards you.

She shouldn't have piled on the 3 year old who didn't get a toy when she got the 7K she wasn't actually entitled to. I guess that is the equivalency. Publicly and repeatedly telling someone how to parent their kids when you owe them money with no attempt at repayment isn't smart.\n\nYou may not be being entirely honest though.

Sure, OP could have made it one sentence i.e. we have money and my brother and SIL take advantage of us, but the extra details add context and help us understand the specific nuances of the situation so as to make a more well-informed judgement.\n\nSpeaking of which: OP is NTA", "That if someone's a jerk you should one up them as say something absolutely trashy?", "Great name calling.

SIL got an undeserved gift. OP pointed that out, SIL threw a tantrum like the one she criticized her nephew of having. \n\nWhether it\u2019s having kids or having money, SIL wouldn\u2019t have any reason to say anything other than jealousy.", "A loan isn\u2019t an undeserved gift, especially when SIL didn\u2019t know it existed.", "A loan that has been forgiven (as this one is) *is* a gift, and the \"SIL didn't know / or forgot\" was not information that OP possessed at the time.", "If that particular loan had been forgiven, OP wouldn\u2019t have brought up that it was unpaid.  \n\nSo while your discussion of hypothetical loans and gifts is interesting, those hypotheticals have nothing to do with the present situation."]}
