Im surprised she would even ask such a thing. Perhaps technically not a ethics violation but definitely a conflict.   That's your brother!!   Refer her to legal aid or the clerks office.   It's not that hard to handle a simple divorce pro se.", "Info: You say in your comments that it's a bad idea and in the post you say you're not going to betray your brother. \n\nSo why are you on here asking if you did the right thing? What's missing in this story that makes you consider helping her?", "Wait, she's a SAHM and he has access to all accounts? Isn't that... exactly what the family court system is set up to prevent? Frankly the fact that she doesn't even have access to enough money to afford an attorney is so egregious that I'd bet a lawyer would be willing to work on contingency. NTA for not wanting to represent her yourself, but I think helping her find a lawyer who is willing to help her would be fine. I get not wanting to betray your brother but allowing your brother to completely screw his STBX in the divorce is going to be bad for his kids, your nieces/nephews. \n\nBesides, while you worked in family law and you know this better than I do, what do you think would happen if this a judge finds out that she literally has zero access to finances to the point that she can't afford an attorney to represent herself? Cause I personally would not expect that to go well for your brother.", "NTA but for a layer, you sure mispeled a lotta werds", "NAH. I feel like the only reason I\u2019m not giving you a Y T A verdict is because she\u2019s technically family and I would consider it a conflict of interest even if it\u2019s not legally. \nHOWEVER, I do think you\u2019re being an A H in this situation. By your own admission your brother was a terrible husband and sounds like super financially abusive-your SIL left her job to be a stay at home parent leaving her without any protections and now she\u2019s totally screwed because your brother is refusing her access to the family money. She is the mother of your niblings and without your help she won\u2019t get any support in the divorce process and her husband is not giving her to opportunity for fair access to legal counsel. You could help her but you\u2019re choosing not to. I\u2019m hoping once they get in front of a judge your brother is torn to shreds for his actions and I hope she gets a fair settlement-but I don\u2019t know if that is the reality and it sucks that someone who could help make it so refuses to, especially due to loyalty to someone you yourself think was toxic.\n\nAnd I just want to clarify by help, I\u2019m not just referring to being her lawyer. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have referrals to people that might be willing to help without upfront payment. Or you could point her to the right resources to advocate for herself in getting access to the accounts before the proceedings. Or even better would be helping her build a case that she can represent herself in without you needing to be named. \nJust know that everyone in this story will remember your actions. Your brother will remember you supporting him as he treated the mother of his children this way, but so will she and one day so will those children. Can you stand by your current position in this forever? Would you be proud to be remembered for this in 10 years time?", "NTA - there's no way you should do it. It's a complete conflict of interest. No matter what the outcome, she would complain you hadn't gotten her all she deserved, AND your brother would think you got her more than she deserved. It is no win for everyone and silly of her to ghink you would, could, or should fo it.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re under no obligation to help her out. And I think there might be a conflict of interest thing going on. But I\u2019m not confident in THAT part of it. But what I am sure of is that you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about not helping her.", "NTA They signed a pre-nup, it is what it is. You're not an attorney. She can research her options but spousal support is determined by the number of years of marriage and child support is determined by income and it varies by jurisdiction and it all depends on the stipulations in the pre-nup.", "NTA\n\nLook, regardless of who is or isn't the bad guy in the divorce, and we frankly know nothing beyond the very surface aspects, the fact is that what she's asking of you is a grotesque conflict of interests. Even if there are no rules against that, and I don't know since IANAL, it's still ludicrously inappropriate to request that you support her against your brother pro bono or really at all.\n\nLike, I get she's in a terrible position, but she has to realize just what a landmine that would be potentially in the court room and outside of it.", "NTA\n\nBut your brother is a huge AH to not give her funds for a lawyer. With this prenup and her becoming a sahm (i agree, this was very, VERY stupid of her) i would consider this financial abuse - at least morally. \n\nIf you once loved a person enough to marry them, you stay rational and fair till the divorce is over, no matter what happend or who got hurt. At least thats my opinion.", "NTA\n\nIt's best you stay as far away from getting involved in that as you can. Her not being able to afford a lawyer is HER problem, not yours.", "NTA - I\u2019d say the sensible option is to keep your distance from the whole thing, saves being accused of taking sides", "NAH\n\n1.  This is your brother.  You can be loyal to him.\n2. This is not your circus and not your monkeys.  Don't get involved more than you needs to.", "NTA --- Wouldn't this fall under a conflict of interests so therefore you can't represent her?.", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nThis is a can of worms.\n\nWhat if she got nothing and thought you did her over to help your brother? Then sued you. I wouldn't do it if they were both on good terms. She needs someone entirely independent.", "'Lawyer' asking for advice on Reddit/AITH... suuuure.", "NTA.  Your own blood comes first.", "not the asshole thats your brother man and a ex wife thats probaly breaking your brothers heart so in my opinion dont help her at all. i had a kinda same situation but i was just the by stander in the family and my cousin was a lawyer and she did not just tell his ex wife no she gave her step brother tips to win the court case to get the most out of it", "NTA.\n\nShe is the enemy now.\n\nDo not help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stay well clear if I were you", "NTA.  This would be a terrible idea.", "NTA but that prenup seems ripe for an abusive partner to really take advantage of their partner. Could you possible ask a coworker to help and offer to do the same for them if their family members ever needs it. I truly think helping her would be the right thing morally, but understand it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea with your conflicting interests.", "It would surely be considered legally unethical, a conflict of interest.", "Theoretically i could but in general its a bad idea", "Clients can waive conflicts and depending on how the funding is set up, that wouldn't generate a conflict. The lawyer always has to act in the best interest of the client within the standards of professional conduct no matter where the funding is coming from. Do they? Not really. \n\nIf the money is put in such a way the sibling can't pull the funding depending on how the divorce is proceeding then I don't see an issue.", "my brother wasnt exactly the best husband not going into to much details he was super controlling and toxic. Without my hel shed most probably get screwed over in the divorce", "I can say much but it depends on if the prenup states that finances would be kept separate. Since the court doesn't care that much about fairness in the split of assets as long as the prenup meats the requirement to be a legally binding contract.", "Nothing wrong with challenging a prenup. Let the judge decide if it's fair to uphold or not.", "Sounds like if you weren't successful getting the assets she wanted she could turn on you claiming it was conflict of interest for you to take her case. NTA.", "NTA but honestly this prenup is kind of fucked up. I\u2019d understand with two adults earning their own money but the minute she became a SAHM that means she\u2019s basically forfeiting any financial stability if she leaves the relationship, which is a horrible place to be in\u2014especially if your brother was toxic. In theory she was providing labor for years, as a stay at home mom, but now with no equity to show for it. I do feel bad for the situation she is in and wish the prenup could have been amended when she stopped working.", "I had a feeling. Seems like a referral could ease your conscience.", "You said she was a sahm. That means you have a niece or nephew. It would be in their best interest if their mother doesn't get screwed by the settlement. Can you direct her toward an attorney who could help her?", "oh, on seeing this information, fuck that. Your brother is an abuser and he's holding her hostage with financial control. If you stay loyal to an abuser, you are an enabler. YTA if you do nothing in this situation and allow your brother to keep all the money and custody, and therefore allow his kids to grow up in a toxic environment. As I said in another comment, representing her yourself is probably not the best idea but you definitely should help her find someone, because this is just a purely disgusting situation and I can't imagine that prenup holding up in court.", "Would the argument that the prenup was made under very different circumstances (both of them working) not hold up? Or the argument that the finances portion of prenup is so one-sided under current circumstances at this point that it fails to meet the criteria of a legally binding contract?", "Exactly, she can research valid options to challenge a pre-nup. Somethings in divorce are determined by local law and the distribution of property is negotiated.", "If she thinks the lawyer did a shit job because they were representing the interests of the funder rather than her own interests then her recourse is against the lawyer not the funder.", "This prenup won\u2019t hold up in court and the \u201cbrother\u201d is going to get in big trouble for withholding money from his spouse.", "Yeah most prenups have clauses for this kind of thing i guess she just didnt cvare back then or something", "change in circumstance doesn't work but you could argue that It is unfair but the other side could argue that at the time of signing the contract was fair and became lopsided due to the personal choice of the party. A contract can only be voided for unfairness if I use my higher bargaining power to make you sign a unfair deal which is a different thing than you did something to make it a shitty deal for yourself\n\nedit- for spelling", "It seems like she is asking OP to be the lawyer not to fund a lawyer."]}
