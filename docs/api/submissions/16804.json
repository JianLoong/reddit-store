She knew she messed up but expected me to try them all. \n\n\nI thanked her and told her we can still order or go out and she should not have bothered cooking because she knows of her poor cooking skills very well. \n\n\nShe got upset and told me at least I could've tried it before she cleaned the table and told me I can order for myself. \nShe had her own cooked meal and did not touched what I ordered. \n\n\nNow I look back and think maybe I was a bit too harsh, does this make me an AH?", "created_utc": 1683643634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cszzl/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_shouldve_saved/", "score": 3028, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me clear it's about your phrasing and breakdown of communication. You saying \" she should not have bothered cooking because she knows of her poor cooking skills very well\" is so tactless. Even if it didn't turn out well, this way of delivering the comment just completely shuts down her efforts.\n\nI understand it was your birthday as there are, as you pointed out OP, other ways to better celebrate the occasion. It was also a little unrealistic of your wife to expect you to try all the dishes. \n\nHowever, there are other ways to navigate the situation without being crass or bringing up your wife's cooking skills.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say **ESH**.\n\nI mean, clearly you're a massive AH. Your wife wanted to do something special for you and put in a huge effort to cook you a meal from scratch instead of just ordering from a restaurant. She likely spent hours choosing recipes she thought you'd like, grocery shopping, doing food prep, and cooking, not to mention setting the table, etc. And she did it all because she loves you so much and she wanted to show you in a really personal way. \n\nAnd while you didn't have to like food that turned out terribly, there was literally no good reason in the whole world why you had to be extraordinarily rude, belittling, and repeatedly  denigrate her. Like . . . why? Why would it even occur to you that the best response to someone going to all that trouble to do something nice for you is to humiliate and insult them? You could have been appreciative and told her how much her effort meant to you, but that despite that, clearly it didn't work out as she'd intended, and while it was so sweet of her to try, you'd love to treat her to a really nice takeaway for all the hard work she put in.\n\nHOWEVER . . .\n\nWhere I'm going to part ways with all the other commenters is that I think she's an AH too. Not for cooking you dinner - that was really sweet of her - but because she has eyes and tastebuds, and was clearly aware that somewhere along the way it went seriously wrong. \n\nShe knew that the food didn't turn out correctly and was barely edible, and yet she became weird and stubborn and tried to force you to taste it all anyway. Again . . . WHY? She can want her hard work acknowledged with words, but it's weird and unfair to actually want to PUNISH you by forcing you to \"taste\" food that she already knows is going to taste terrible. It was your birthday, and the whole point of the meal was that it was supposed to be a gift and a treat for you. Her weird power play of insisting that you choke some of it down, knowing that it was bad, was super inappropriate. When a meal doesn't turn out correctly, you don't force people to eat it, you shrug your shoulders, acknowledge the loss, and move on. \n\nESH here. You were rude, she was controlling, and honestly, it sounds like you deserve each other.", "YTA - It's fine to not like her cooking, but you didn't have to insult her and belittle the effort she put in. She clearly wanted to do something nice for you. Also, how is she supposed to learn how to cook if you all you do is mock her efforts?", "NTA\n\nThere are better days for learning to cook.", "YTA.   I hate cooking and baking,  but a couple of years back, I made my husband a birthday cake.  It was an utter disaster.  He told me it was great, and he appreciated the effort (my kids weren't so kind and told me it tasted like wet cat, which it kind of did)\n\nIt's all about the effort.  She tried because she cares, you shat all over that effort.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say ESH.\n\nwhile I do think your wife\u2019s intentions weren\u2019t bad in the least (the idea of a home cooked romantic meal for your spouse is a sweet one), the idea that someone who never ever cooks would try to do this as a birthday present is pretty misguided.\n\ni empathize with her because I\u2019m sure she put a lot of effort into it and tried her best, but this isn\u2019t a kid\u2019s art project it\u2019s your birthday dinner. doesn\u2019t seem fair for you to be forced to grin and bear it on your own birthday because your wife tried hard.\n\nthat being said it\u2019s pretty clearly ESH for me because you lacked any tact. if you politely tried the food then said \u201choney, I appreciate the effort you put into making this, but I was really looking forward to Italian food tonight?\u201d then this isn\u2019t a big fight.\n\nIt sucks to try and cook for someone and fail. It\u2019s embarrassing, you feel like you wasted all this time, like an idiot, etc., and especially if it\u2019s for your partner on their birthday you\u2019re gonna beat yourself up for it. Doesn\u2019t mean you should have to finish your plate, but have a bit more empathy mate", "Honestly NTA. \n\nI can\u2019t crochet anything without it turning out lopsided and crooked af. As I know this I would Not crochet something for someone\u2019s birthday at all, but certainly not expecting them to be grateful for the clump of yarn. \n\nShe Knows she can\u2019t cook, yet she decided to try it anyway.\n\nIf she\u2019d have wanted to do so she should have gotten lessons and surprised you once she was capable.", "Nta. I\u2019m on your side oP. She knows she\u2019s a terrible cook and knows that the food turned out bad. Not sure why she thought your birthday was the time to experiment", "YTA.   \n\n\nI am glad that you aren't my spouse.", "I am going against the grain here and say NTA. OP said he thanked her, suggested still getting takeout bc she knows she can\u2019t cook, and really shouldn\u2019t have bothered. In all seriousness guys this is not horrible. It\u2019s not overly polite but it\u2019s not disrespectful to tell your spouse this especially when that spouse is not and has never been known as a good cook. \n\n\nLet\u2019s be honest\u2026.special occasions and holidays are not the times to be messing up food especially when they both know their abilities or lack thereof. If OP and his wife can afford a FT maid who cooks their food for the week surely OPs wife could\u2019ve at least put thought into maybe taking a cooking class or asking their maid for help with making dinner.", "Might be an unpopular opinion but ESH \n\nYou clearly should've been kinder in expressing your disappointment, maybe having a kind and honest conversation about why you weren't enjoying yourself and making the situation lighter. You could've appreciated her efforts more even if the dinner wasn't great.\n\nHowever, preparing a birthday gift for someone knowing that it most likely will be a failure, instead of thinking about what the other person would actually enjoy is bad taste. \n\nShe knows she can't cook, she knows it turned out badly and YET you're expected to spend your birthday dinner pretending it was great and eating barely edible food to spare her feelings.", "ESH you for not being gracious, her for giving you a gift of cooking on your birthday when she quite literally cannot cook. It\u2019s not \u201cthe thought that counts\u201d when you ruin a meal that is supposed to be special. That\u2019s the opposite of a gift.", "NTA she set herself up for failure and expected you to be rosy about it. You were an ass, yeah, but a justified one. She could have guessed what would happen pretty fast, and basically made sure you had a bad day by her own poor decision. You tried, the obviously bad choice was actually an obviously bad choice and you said as much. That was the foreseeable consequence, and the wife brought it on. You could have lied to her, but it\u2019s your birthday \u2026 you should get something edible if you pay a freaking chef.", "ESH. A couple of years ago I tried my hand at making our anniversary dinner- it turned out terribly. \n\nI knew it was bad and when my partner came through the door he took one look at it, laughed, and asked if pizza was okay. \n\nI was wise enough to know that food was inedible and not be offended that he wanted no parts in it, and he was kind enough make me feel better and offer an alternative. \n\nWhere you failed is in not reading the room. Your wife put a lot of effort into a horrendous meal, you didn\u2019t have to eat a thing, but you could\u2019ve at least told her that you appreciated her efforts without saying anything about her inability to cook. \n\nShe was probably already embarrassed but she shouldn\u2019t have pressured you to eat something that was not edible. \n\nI can\u2019t say that I would have handled this situation any better, and you did the best you could at the time, you didn\u2019t say anything that was abhorrently untrue. You could have been softer and she could have made a joke out of the situation, hopefully you\u2019ll both be able to laugh about this one day. \n\nDon\u2019t stress over it too much.", "YTA. She tried to do something special. It didn't work, but you could have been nicer about it. Something like \"this was a very sweet gesture, thank you for the effort, I'm sorry it didnt work out the way you wanted\" would have been better than what you said. You could jave at least tried it, and then let her down gently. Maybe even found some humour in the situation.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't remind her she can't cook before she tried. He reminded her after she wasted his time setting the table up to play house and serving him multiple terrible dishes she expected him to try, when she must have known they were inedible before he even tried them. She knows what good food is and she had to know what she made wasn't good.\n\nGet better and don't make people eat your ruined food and then guilt trip them over it. That's toddler behavior.", "ESH. You were tactless but she denied your birthday request so she could cook only to completely fuck it up. I think its becoming a real problem in our society where people refuse to acknowledge their limitations and everyone is supposed to give them a participation trophy.", "NTA. Dawg...I'm not eating shitty food on my birthday. It's the one day a year I stop putting up w everyone else's shit for 24 hours", "YTA she spent a lot of time on this and tried really hard. You could have given her a hug, thanked her for cooking and asked if she'd be okay with ordering food. AFTER you've tried the food (not the burnt bits).\n\nYou enjoy putting her down for her non-existing  cooking skills, but interestingly you also don't seem to be able to cook.", ">Now I look back and think maybe I was a bit too harsh\n\nYa think?\n\n>does this make me an AH?\n\nYes. Yes it does.\n\nYTA. You are such an AH.", "Going against the grain, but NTA.\n\nOP could have handled it better and acknowledged the gesture, but inedible food on your birthday is a sad gift.\nOP asked to go out to eat on his birthday. Wife denied this request. \nThis household doesn\u2019t cook at all. The wife decides to cook for this birthday with a history of unsuccessful cooking attempts. Insisting OP tries everything even if the food looks unappetizing feels like a parent having the rule that you have to try everything on your plate.", "Unpopular opinion but ESH. You didn\u2019t have to be so harsh.

You didn't need to insult her to get your point across. Yes you were too harsh. She was trying to do something special for you, put in a lot of effort and you stomped on that.", "ESH.

And you swatted her down and told her not to bother because she sucks.\n\nYou are an asshole. There was more love in that meal than in a lifetime of generic restaurant food.

It's interesting how much you understate your own lack of empathy when you were so brutally \"honest\" with her about her cooking.", "YTA, she made an effort and did something nice for you. You know she struggles with cooking, so this was even more difficult for her, and instead of appreciating the kind gesture you belittled her and humiliated her. It's unfortunate she couldn't gift you some empathy for your birthday, because you are in sore need of some.", "YTA. Her cooking skills will never improve without her practicing. She clearly was trying to do something special for you for your birthday. You being unsupportive and cruel likely cemented the fact that she's never going to try again.", "NTA.

She should've stopped trying to get you to try the food after that, and trying to guilting you into it is an asshole move. \n\nESH, you more so than her though imo. \n\nEdit to add: especially since she tried to make you feel bad when the food was obviously not well-prepared.", "I want details.

I cannot paint, I would never dream of trying to paint something for my husband's birthday. Unless I took painting classes first and put in legitimate effort before the day of to make the gift better, which doesn't sound like she really did? I can see a spouse trying to cook a special dinner if there were financial constraints that meant going out to eat wasn't an option, but considering you have a cook most of the week that's clearly not an obstacle she was trying to avoid with this. Some else's special day just isn't the time to practice something you're bad at imo so I feel like she's slightly more TA here, but I am big on giving presents that the other person wants on their day. Have you always wanted her to learn to cook for you? I can maybe see that being why she went for cooking, but it doesn't sound like it from your post.", "YTA, and you seem pretty horrible in general.

Someone's birthday dinner is not the time to experiment with recipes, or try your hand at something that you've historically been very bad at. So she certainly put you in a position of needing to sacrifice your own birthday happiness over this. \n\nAnd OP \\*did\\* try to suggest going out for dinner before any of this happen, which is wife declined.\n\nSo yes, OP is an asshole for being tactless, but the wife is also an asshole for putting him in a situation where he has to feign happiness on his birthday.\n\nAlso, even with more tact, I have a feeling the wife would have been offended, which is silly.
