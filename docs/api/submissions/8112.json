If I were you, I would have told him he wasn't going on the trip after he cheated on me. I would have told him in very impolite words where he could go though.Your friends,mom and ex are TA for expecting you to take him to Disney World with his side piece!

Naw. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA at all! really, the audacity of him to even ask about the trip after he cheated on you. i hate derek and everyone that stood by his side on this.", "Nta. You don't owe him anything.", "Are you really asking if you\u2019re an asshole for not giving a loving gift worth thousands to someone who betrayed you and hurt you? Why the hell would you still plan to go on this trip with him and let him walk all over you? He moved in with the person he cheated with right away! There\u2019s zero respect on his part for you.\n\nWhat kind of terrible dude is this? Crazy enough this was still almost happening at that point in time and he brings the person he cheated with and wants you to pay for them too??? Then people were screaming at you and saying you\u2019re bad? He is literally with a new person. They all wanted you to be used. I don\u2019t know how you managed to plan that out with the pain knowing he just hopped but thank god you took someone else and had a good time as i was about to type why you didn\u2019t do that! NTA x1000. Don\u2019t let someone walk all over you and use you like that ever again. He and kam are sick. Cut him out forever, you seem like a thoughtful loving person to offer such a generous gift.

Yes, you were originally going to take your ex for his birthday, but he\u2019s an AH for the entitlement of still expecting his birthday trip. I know you tried to go as friends, but he double-downed on his entitlement by expecting you to pay for his bf. He (probably) tried to pull a petty power move on you and had to get his mom & friends to call you while he (probably) sulked like a spoiled child.

He should be ashamed of himself for his shit behaviour and put some distance from those who think like him", ">They also pointed out that I could\u2019ve just canceled the entire trip and not gone but me going was just to hurt Derek more.\n\nWTF why on Earth would you cancel the trip when your tickets were free from work and you paid for the hotel already? Even if you canceled you likely would have had a penalty on a hotel and would have wasted the Disneyland tickets. \n\nAlso, the biggest point, he was your cheating ex. You already offered an olive branch that absolutely no one else would have. \n\nIf anything this is a life lesson to not feel bad when people fuck themselves over. Your ex cheated on you and had no right to the birthday vacation anymore.\n\nYou need to completely cut off your ex (and a few of your shitty friends) and going forward look out for yourself a bit more.\n\nNTA", "I'd say screw him but that's not going to happen.

The audacity to think that he can cheat, then make you a 3rd wheel on a vacation that you paid for and not even ask! The icing on the cupcake of entitlement was expecting you to pay for Kam!

He had never gone and had talked about it often. My job happens to give us tickets every year and I decided to use them for this trip. I got a hotel on property and booked dining reservations. Even though the tickets were free I was still spending over $2000 for a weeklong trip. It wasn\u2019t a secret and he was very excited to go. Derek started getting distant and soon after I found out he had been cheating on me with his best friend Kam.\u00a0\n\nI kicked him out of the house (he moved in with Kam) and cut contact despite his attempts to reach out. A couple weeks before the trip he texted me asking about it. We had a long call and decided to go as \u201cfriends\u201d with the stipulation he now pays for any food. I wasn\u2019t exactly excited to spend a week with someone who broke my heart but I felt bad for kicking him out and being unwilling to talk.\u00a0\n\nWe were supposed to leave the day before his birthday. He shows up to my house with Kam and I assume he\u2019s just being dropped off but then both of them unload a bag. Derek says it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal if Kam comes along and I asked what he would do about not having tickets for the parks. Derek said I could buy tickets for Kam and he\u2019d pay me back eventually. I told him if he wants this trip it would be without his new boyfriend as I was uncomfortable with the idea of spending a week in a hotel with them. He tells me to just give the tickets to them and they\u2019ll go celebrate his birthday since I\u2019m being difficult and that \u201cit\u2019s my birthday I get to choose who I spend it with\u201d. I got in my car and drove the whole way to Disney world with my phone on dnd. At the hotel I looked at my phone to see 10 missed calls from Derek, a couple from our friends, and one from his mom. She left a voicemail saying I was just a selfish spoiled brat who couldn\u2019t handle not getting my way and that I was holding Derek\u2019s cheating over his head.\u00a0\n\nI ended up inviting a friend who lived nearby to spend the vacation with me and we had a wonderful time. Once back home I met up with some friends who said I was petty for leaving Derek packed and ready for a trip but then not taking him. They also pointed out that I could\u2019ve just canceled the entire trip and not gone but me going was just to hurt Derek more. Talking with them has left me conflicted about this so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First, NTA.  At all.  Second, why on EARTH would your cheating ex BF think for 1 second that you would be ok with him bringing the guy he CHEATED ON YOU WITH on a trip out of town to the 'Happiest place on Earth'??  NTA but maybe out of touch for planning ongoing as friends.  He was using you, his mom is off her rocker, and your friends are not rational.  Good grief.  Just when I think people can't surprise me anymore, smh.", "NTA. No way. I can\u2019t believe the cheek of the guy and anyone agreeing with him. To do what he was expecting is freaking ludicrous. His parents can send him if they\u2019re so concerned. You did good and everyone in your life who disagrees with you is wrong.", "NTA he done goofed", "NTA. You paid for it, so it\u2019s your trip to spend however you want. Derek does not get a birthday present from you. And of course you will \u201chold the cheating over his head,\u201d that is what cheaters deserve!", "NTA. And get rid of any friend that even remotely sided with Derek. Wtf", "NTA  \nHe cheated on you!!!  You owe him nothing, not this trip, not a single cent, not a moment of your time. \n\nSeriously you are kind of an AH to yourself for agreeing to this trip after what he did.", "Seriously\u2026this!!!\nYou need new friends. He cheated on you. You have zero obligation to him after the break up. \nNTA", "Right? I bet not one of those \u201cfriends\u201d would follow thru with the trip were they in OP\u2019s shoes.
