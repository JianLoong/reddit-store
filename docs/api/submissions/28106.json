When I do so, I apologize to whomever I\u2019ve said it to right away, since I recognize that it puts the focus on how I\u2019d be more comfortable if the people I care about didn\u2019t get hurt, rather than on the fact that someone I care about got hurt. Your girlfriend may be repeating patterns from her childhood, but you\u2019ve asked her to stop, and she should honestly reflect on why her first instinct when there\u2019s been an injury is to make you responsible for her feelings of anxiety and attempt to instill more anxiety into you.", "Okay but\u2026 she is not saying it for hindsight. She is saying it because you keep being not careful and getting hurt. Maybe if you listened to her you wouldn\u2019t get hurt as much.

What you do need to do is let things cool off, and then when you're both in a better frame of mind, explain to her that even if you'd slammed your hand in the window on purpose, that when the first reaction implies blame, then it really is like a kick in the face to add insult to injury. At that point, you further explain that from now on, you will not respond to her if all she's going to do is show off her keen sense of the obvious when something like this happens. \n\nWhen someone is injured, the normal reaction is to see that the person is going to be okay. If the incident is one that doesn't require major first aid, then you have all the banter you are comfortable with after this is established. \n\nI think that if you discuss this when you're a bit further removed from the injury, it might get through to her how annoying that sort of shit is.", "NTA, if u say something annoys you, and someone keeps doing it, shouldn't be surprised u get mad for it", "NTA, i also hate this response.", "NTA, \"obviously it's your fault, be more careful\" as compared to \"are you fine, are you hurt\"", "Definitely NTA.\n\nThat would seriously annoy me too.", "NTA.
