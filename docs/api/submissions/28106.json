Also, is she helping in these repairs, or just criticizing you?

Depending on the tone it's more of a statement of annoyance that the speaker has to deal with the problem than it is one of concern. It's true it can also be said in a loving way but considering that OP is not taking it that way and asked his GF to stop, there are much better ways to be supportive to an injured person that you love than this.

What is the actual point of telling someone to be more careful when they are in pain from something that has already happened?", "NTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t that big of a deal imo. But she is being annoying. He is obviously trying to be careful, he isn\u2019t trying to kill himself. She should at least ask if he is okay and see if she can help first. After everything is fine she could than ask him to please be more careful. It does sound useless to say that, but come on, even OP said he is continuously getting injured doing this stuff. He could probably be more careful if he tried.

As if your carelessness is why you're hurt. \n\nMy parents did this and I learned to hide when I was hurt becsuse I felt like they just blamed me.

If you can't do that, just say nothing. \"", "Nta. It's the same as when you do it to a child. It's pointless it's shaming and it's not caring.

Just because the injuries you have so far are minor does not mean if you keep going on like this you can get a more severe injury 3.

Being careful always means reducing the risk of injury/incident to absolutely zero, correct?\n\nMuch like when someone gets in their car everyday and drives to work?
