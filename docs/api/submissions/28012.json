Her brothers(my uncle's) came to babysit me most of the time. When I turned 14-15 my mom told me the truth that my father left her as soon as she found out she was pregnant. She let me see a picture even tho I wasn't really interested. He looked different since we all are asians and all my family has black hair and eyes but my bio father had blonde hair and grey or blue eyes.\n\nMy mom told me that my dad was dangerous and a bad person ever since I was little and to never meet or even try to contact him and my uncles were on her side. I obeyed because I don't care who this man is. This man has never been in my life and his existence didn't bother me at all. I was happy in my little bubble.\n\nI am 16 and yesterday had a Karate competition. My mom was proud because it was a very big competition with multiple schools joining. We both were dissappointed when we saw the date because my mom had a very important work to do which is personal so I won't be mentioning it here.\n\nOn the day of the competition everyone was cheering the student that were their family with their name written in big letters on a board. 2 or 3 matches passed by and I noticed that someone was holding my name on the letter board which made me confused. At first I lit up thinking my mom might have dealt with her work more quickly and came for my big day. As I ran to the person I realised it was not my mom. It was a man and so I thought maybe my mom sent one of my uncles to cheer me. But the moment I saw the blonde hair and the familiar face I got terrified because I know my mom would be super mad if she found out so I ran back away. \n\nAfter some moment I received a call from my mom who was furious. She told me how now the horrible man knew what I looked like and how dangerous it is. But I didn't do it on purpose. My whole family is mad at me and I feel so upset. I don't know much but I know that this issue is going to involve court.

He went there. So, either a family member told him about it or it was big enough that it was published. And it was that popular, would they not have announced your name at all? He'd have figured out who you were based on where you were standing/when you were competing, etc. \n\nDoesn't sound like you even made it all the way to him, and yet your mom is blaming you.\n\n\nIf he left as soon as he found out she was pregnant, how does he even know your name?\n\n\nEither he's actually dangerous and she should have some form of legal order and be more concerned about the idea that was able to track you down, or she's lying about contact (or one of your uncles or someone else kept contact).", "Info: waaaay above our paygrade, kiddo.  He could be an ear,-collecting arms dealer, or a decent chump that your family decided to ice out for the crime of being foreign - no way to tell.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault for being excited to see your name and thinking it was a close family member. How were you supposed to know that is was your bio dad? From what your mum told you he shouldn\u2019t know who you are or what your name is so how were you supposed to know different? If anything this is on your mum and uncles a little bit for a) not giving you more information on the man, b) not being there for you, especially if they knew he had an interest in you c) scaring you and shaming you. You are a minor, they are all adults", "Nta, you didn't know who it was and backed off as soon as you noticed. I'm curious what your mom thinks you should've done instead?", "Nta you might not want to believe everything your mom tells you. Just be cautious of everything.", "NTA. Were you really supposed to reason \"Hey maybe I better not check out who is holding up a sign with my name on it?\" What were you going to do, run and hide and not finish the competition in case it might have been bio dad and he might have seen you? Someone should have been there with you.", "NTA.\n\n But i feel like there's something missing here how did your bio father know your name, if as you say he walked out as soon as your mother found out that she was pregnant with you.", "Nta. I'm guessing there is a parental alienation situation. Kid, my best advice is to get the truth from anyone willing to tell you. If dad has found you now, I'm guessing first contact isn't that far away. I'm guessing mom is hiding a really dark secret from you.", "NTA. You did what any normal person would do. You thought it could be your mom or some other family & friends - so you went to investigate. Please don't feel bad that you followed a normal instinct.\n\nIt seems like you've never had this happen before, so why in the world would you think it could happen on that day? Your family should not be angry with you, as you did nothing malicious. In fact, they seem to have lost the fact that you avoided the man as soon as you recognized him in all their outrage.\n\nYour family is mad at your bio-dad and they're taking it out on you because they can. I hope you can forgive them after they calm down.\n\nEDIT: After reading the other comments, it made me think that you may be able to find the information about your family through legal channels. I believe most arrests, etc are public record in the US.  Go to r/legal and I bet they can help you out on this.", "NTA. How could you be an AH in this circumstance?\n\nYou need to ask your mum and uncle why they want you to avoid him so much.", "NTA and I'm sorry, but this sounds like a mystery that I personally couldn't live with. Why is he horrible? Why should you avoid him? You're sixteen, you deserve to know why you're supposed to run from the guy and your family should definitely give you clear answers.", "NTA\nFrom personal experience involving a relative...your father might not be a bad guy. Your mom may have been lying to keep you from being interested in finding him. Or he might be everything your mom says. Either way, this situation isn't your fault.", "INFO: How did your mom know this guy was at the match and that you ran towards him at first?", "nta.  You didn't know who it was until you got closer.", "NTA - you were not expecting him to be there and hopeful that some other family member was there to cheer you on. \n\nI would check into public records or something, because there's more going on that your father abandoned your mother when she was pregnant with you.", "NTA - The main dynamic here is between your mom and bio-dad... and it started before you did. I suspect the anger she expressed to you was born out of fear and panic. Just remember you are the product of that situation, not the cause.", "My mom used to tell me the same things about my bio dad, that he was a dangerous monster. \n\nHe stopped drinking the month she left him! He never knew about me. He had a personality disorder that got really bad on the alcohol. She never knew about the personality disorder, it was another decade before he got diagnosed. \n\nAnyways, come to your own conclusions, the man she knew may or may not exist anymore. \n\nNAH", "NTA, 1) this is so weird, but you did nothing wrong. How could you have known that was your father ? You couldn't have, that's the answer, so your family has no right or reason to be upset with you 2) clearly your family is lying to you about something that you deserve to know. How in the hell would he know your name if he left when he found out your mom was pregnant ? and 3) if your father was \"so dangerous\" that they have warned you so much that it started to upset and annoy you, why was no one else there to watch you ? Like wouldn't you think they would want someone to watch over *in case* your father showed up ? Like that's so stupid.", "You are NTA and who knows if what you are being told is even truthful? But how did your mother know about this incident? How did he know you were in the contest? \n\nYou are entitled to some answers about why he is dangerous. What his name is etc.", "Op we not trying to call ur mom a liar or anything but I\u2019ll definitely look into ur dad if i was u", "We have no way of knowing if your bio dad is dangerous or if your mother is lying .\n\nYou don't have the INFO we need either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can\u2019t keep this to herself, he is legally YOUR  father.", "You deserve the truth.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI have to wonder if your mother walked out of a legal custody agreement and has kept you 'hidden' from him.  Could be a dangerous guy, it's true, but it also could be disagreements about nationality/religion/lifestyle.  \n\n\nSomebody who approaches the kid by holding up a sign to a 16yo doesn't sound really dangerous.  If you hadn't been shown a picture just the one time by your uncle you wouldn't have even known it was him.  Ethically/morally, you are being kept in the dark and that might actually endanger you.  \n\n\nBut... depending on your country, you're nearing adulthood, so you're going to be able to find out more details on your own.  (I'd start by using an anonymous login on a library computer to check on your father's name in public databases and social media.)  \n\n\nYour family MAY be doing their best to keep you safe, but then again...?", "I don't know actually. I wanted to talk to my mom about it but she refuses to answer. My family never really mentions my dad around me. The only reason I saw his picture was because one of my uncle said that I atleast deserved to see the man who is my bio father and said that to avoid him I need to know his face. So my mom agreed to show me his picture. But rather than that I don't know anything and I don't want to ask either because my mom is in a very bad mood.", "They are probably mad because my mom had always warned me several times ever since I was growing up to the point I started getting annoyed because she kept warning me repeatedly when I already got the point that I am supposed to avoid this man. My mom had always warned me and told me that he was not a good person so even after warning me so many times I still failed to do as follows.", "I wonder too. My guess is they reconnected over phone or text messages and my mom felt obliged to atleast talk about me with him but she absolutely forbids me to ever ask questions or mention him.", "Believe me I have no idea. My guess is that our driver (who drove me there) saw the interaction and told her but other than that I have no clue.", "I think I might know the answer to the 3rd point. My bio father looked like a foreigner and I live in an Asian country. My family probably thought that he would forever be in a European country rather than in an Asian country in which I live in but my mom's paranoia was still big so she still warned me and as the years went by they started to loosen up. I mean I didn't expect to meet him either.  I didn't even know my bio father was a foreigner because I didn't get any genetic traits for him. My family probably thought since he was not here 16 years he probably never will come back here. But the rest of the questions Idk. And there actually was someone to watch me. I forgot to mention our personal family driver who drove me to my competition since my mother was busy.", "Can you talk to your uncle?\n\nIf your biological father is actually dangerous, you deserve the information. If he's not, you also deserve that information.", "Is it possible that your bio dad is trying to share custody of you but your mom won't let him?", "Sorry kid but I think your family is lying to you. This just doesn't make any sense.\n\nNo way would a mother give her child's details to someone if (the child's been continuously told) they are dangerous and to stay away. If that was true and there's a real danger then why not involve the police and the courts instead of putting the responsibility of being safe solely on a child??", "I am typing this in an old computer since my phone got taken away (I am currently kinda grounded). All my uncles are on her side and would refuse to answer any questions but if I get my phone back I will try calling them again.", "That\u2019s what court is for if that\u2019s what he really wanted.", "That's true too. She hates him for some reason maybe because he left her pregnant. But I am not sure. I really don't know where that man got my info and details", "Your mom is definitely lying about something. She's grounding you for this guy showing up and you just walking in his direction? It sounds like you didn't actually say a word to him.", "Well since the words were limited I couldn't write the whole thing. I was pretty tired after my matches. I was sweating and I didn't even drink water and straight up ran to him immediately after my last match for the round. My vision and brain was kinda slow but yeah I kind of froze when I finally got close enough and my brain adjusted to who he was. when I realised I was still frozen thinking about what my mom might do if she find out and after a few seconds then ran back away.", "OP, if you live in an Asian country, then you might want to consider that all of this may be a total lie. If your mom ran off with you and didn't want your father to be in your life, some Asian countries are notorious for siding with Asian parents and make it impossible for foreign parents to ever be able to have access to their children. This happens so much. Japan has been in the news for this type of situation more than once. Look them up. Your mom's family could very well be lying about your father because your mom didn't want him around. If he's genuinely a criminal, then what she did was right. But with how they're behaving, I'm suspicious. NTA"]}
