An older brother (40M, kids are 12 & 10) and younger sister (36F, kids are 10, 8, 5). All of us live in NYC so COL is high, but my husband and I have tech/doctor incomes no kids so we\u2019re very spacious with our budget. \n\nAwhile ago, my younger sister asked to borrow money from me. She has 3 kids, and when she got laid off  at the beginning of last year, she, husband and kids burned through savings pretty quickly. She asked to borrow money around June, partially to send her children to a summer camp they\u2019ve been begging to go to, and partially to float her until she found a job again. So far she\u2019s only managed to find a part time job because she hasn\u2019t found a full time job that pays more than childcare would\u2019ve cost her. For Christmas, I forgave the 25k I loaned her, and gave her 2 boys nice winter coats and her preteen daughter a very nice makeup palette and lipsticks. \n\nHowever, since I\u2019d essentially paid for their summer camp too I thought it would be only fair that I spend a similar amount on my brother\u2019s 2 kids, and for Christmas, I booked brother, SIL and their 2 kids a week long trip to Disney world for their upcoming spring break. I never told my brother that our sister asked me for money or that I forgave her loan, and I never told my sister about our brother\u2019s gift. It wasn\u2019t a secret, I just never thought it needed to be told. On my husband\u2019s side, we gave his sister\u2019s kids gifts in similar monetary as well. \n\nRecently my siblings spoke about the kid\u2019s spring break plans and sister is mad I got brother\u2019s kids a much bigger Christmas gift. I pointed out to her I spent an equal amount for her kids that summer, and forgave her debt, but she\u2019s saying her kids won\u2019t understand the importance of my Christmas gift and just see that their cousins got Disney. \n\nI told her it wouldn\u2019t be fair if I paid for her kids to go to camp and not for our brother\u2019s kids. As a compromise I told her if she paid me back the money for their summer camp (9k), I\u2019d pay to add her + kids to brother\u2019s Disney trip. \n\nObviously she can\u2019t do that, but I was angry she was so unappreciative of what she already got from me, and in my pettiness I also added that it was her failure as a parent to not teach her kids why they can\u2019t go. She keeps saying it was unfair between the kids and they\u2019re going to feel left out. Even our parents have said that camp is a normal summer activity but Disney is a special experience and perhaps I was being too harsh on her. I could also easily afford it, so maybe I should just include her kids. \n\nI\u2019m not a Disney person, and I\u2019m not a parent so maybe I\u2019m just not getting it?", "created_utc": 1677363444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bxgg1/aita_for_buying_my_brothers_kids_better_presents/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At least one of her kids are old enough to understand and the brother's kids are old enough. Plus, since she'll never pay you back it makes sense.

You don't have to be the family bank account, just because you have the means to do it.  You have given a ton here, and split it pretty equally between the families, over all.

All mom has to say is \"Aunt  \\_\\_\\_ sent you to summer camp, and gave you your Christmas present 6 months early.  Uncle \\_\\_\\_s kids are getting their present now, and going to Disney.\"  Your sister seems to think that you owe her or her children something, and you don't.  I would be thrilled if I had family who could help me out if I were in a bind like that, and I would be very grateful if they did.  I have a feeling things would have gone differently if she had, a) thanked you for the funds you already gave her, and b) \\*asked\\* you nicely to send her kids to Disney as well, rather than demanded it, and c) asked if there was something she could do to pay you back or at least thank you -- cook a nice dinner, plan a fun day, just \\*something.\\*  I think your sister is angry at herself and her financial situation and / or jealous at your financial success.  She sees herself, and her kids, as victims, and expects you to \"make it even.\"  You feel used, and I don't blame you.  Things happen in life, and as adults we have to deal with them.  It does not mean that we are entitled to be bailed out, and that our children never have to learn that they aren't entitled to a magic carpet life, either (in fact, they're usually a lot better off if they don't grow up thinking that someone else will always bail them out or pay the check).

You were incredibly generous to your sister.\n\nThe kids shouldn't have to suffer though but you need to be careful about what you do.\n\nGifts should be age appropriate too.

Since money was tight, they didn't need to go to camp this year.

It doesn't matter if you have the money to send them to Disney, they don't need to go this year. Explain that you helped her out before and your brothers family trip has nothing to do with her. Your brothers family will gave different experiences than her family and they will not always be able to do what the other family gets to do. Your other niblings didn't go to camp last year, they don't get to go to Didney this year. Don't let your sister guilt into paying for an expensive vacation and don't pay for camp again.

The money you gave to your sister.\n\nAnd the money you spent on your neices and nephews are in two completely different categories.  \n\nAnd I think that's where you went wrong, as this from most people's perspectives is blatant favoritism.  When you look at what you spent on the kids directly.  \n\nThat said, I don't feel right to call you an A H, because you are being very generous when you don't have to be.

If you had been upfront with your sister from the beginning about what you were doing and why, you could've arrived at a reasonable compromise.

And apparently your brother didn't know about that help either - so your brother also assumes he's your favourite sibling.\n\nIf you wanted it to look fair you could have given your brother $25k to spend as he wished (maybe some on day to day costs, and some on activities for the kids), and then given your brother's kids coats / make-up/ equivalent gifts. The other option is to be clear with everyone, including the kids, that the reason you're giving bigger gifts to your brother's kids for Christmas is that you already gave sister a big gift in summer that you are counting towards her kids' Christmas gifts.  Though tbh I reckon sister's kids might have preferred Disney over summer camp... plus as you know, the entirety of the $25k wasn't really for summer camp ie it wasn't really just a gift for the kids. \n\nIMHO either you do have favourites, or you really resent helping your sister.", "I am going to present the way I deal with this same exact issues, and why I believe that you are a little TA.

It's her job to teach her kids.", "Thank how much for posting this. All these people saying poor kiddies make me want to scream. They got almost 40k And you're bitching about it being uneven?!! No. Absolutely not. Sometimes things suck. My kids? NEVER been to Disney. You wanna send them to, cuz if not it's not FAAAAAAIR. LoL", "Just let it go. They are using your desire to have identical number of presents under the Christmas tree to take advantage of you. Everyone should be more than beyond grateful for your incredibly generous, unnecessary gifts. That's just it they're GIFTS, not requirements and to act like you're required to do anything more than you've done or anything at all is frankly rude and ungrateful, and not at all in the spirit of Christmas or your kind, generous giving.\n\nPut your wallet away. You've done enough. Maybe in the future brother will need help. Maybe not. Things are never exactly even. Disney to a 5 year old is a totally different experience then Disney to a 10 or 12 year old. What are you going to do, make sure you send everybody the exact same age so they get the same experience out of it? Of course not. You'll make yourself crazy. Just enjoy a glass of wine and tuck yourself into bed knowing that you're a kind person who tried to do the right thing and that is enough.\n\nThank you for caring. Don't let their entitlement get the best of your huge heart.", "No. You can do whatever you want. Stop trying so hard. You've done enough. If your sister is mad, it's on her. She should be giving you credit for things like summer camp anyway. You are NTA. Let it go. Sis can stew, and even moreso when she needs more money and you won't help later. \n\nIt's a GIFT. NO ONE should say \"but I wanted thaaaaat\" and point at something someone else got. ESPECIALLY after they are the recipient of tens of thousands of dollars from the same person. \n\nNext time she brings it up, look at her and say \"I think you mean \"thank you\". And you're welcome, sis. No need to talk about this again.\"", "Per that logic, you are sending your brother to Disney and his kids are just going with him. You paid enough that he can also take them. You paid enough to your sister that she could also pay for her kid's summer camp.\n\nPart of the reason you gave your sister the amount you did was to pay for their summer camp.", "Exactly.", "It's up to the parents to tell them. Many family members give experience gifts all the time - my MIL got us a membership to the aquarium which isn't even open in December but it was still our Xmas gift. The kids are still benefitting from 25 THOUSAND dollars keeping a roof over their head - a gift all year. Add 9K to summer camp - she is well within her right to give her kids that as their Xmas gift. Even bringing up something else is just nasty on the sisters part. \n\nIt's a GIFT. She doesn't have to give them squat. Sounds to me like the SISTER has her optics wrong. And wanting to take credit for the money her sister is spending, that's really icky - and is creating the kids' messed up optics. So, again, on mom and dad. Not the incredibly awesome aunt.", "Your error is in thinking equal is the same as equitable .  You tried to give your siblings kids equal money but it\u2019s not going over well because it\u2019s an inequitable situation. You helped out your sister because they were in financial strain. That should have stayed there and only comparable situation is if your brother was in similar need due to strain . \nDisney world is a kids dream vacation. \nEven if your sister explains how you helped them out with camp , they won\u2019t ever forget that didn\u2019t get the dream vacation.  Now your sister had no right to blow up at you about it knowing the 25,000 . \n\nESH", "NTA. Your sister has a point that her kids may look at the trip and see that it is unfair, but she also has a responsibility to tell her kids that their aunt paid for their summer camp among other things and that their cousins didn't get summer camp so they get Disney.", "NTA", "NTA and don\u2019t ever give her another dime.", "OK, I think this is \"ESH, evn OP,  but I would do the same\".\n\nIt's clear why your sister is TA - she's entitled, jealous and greedy. She has to accept that her part of family is poor and a) try to change it by myself or b) adjust lifestyle to financial capabilities. NOT expect that rich sister will compensate her for it.\n\nBut why I think you are TA? Because **you** didn't pay for summer camp. You lent your sister 25k and **she** used part of it to pay for camp. Than you forgave her debt as a Christmas gift for **her**. Chidren were not a party in your deal, even if they've benefited from it. \n\nThat means that children didn't get a big Christmas gift from you. Their mother paid for a summer camp with a money she borrowed. It was between you and your sister, but then you decided that you'll make children responsible for mother's debt. That also means that you didn't forgave your sister debt, only (much bigger, I admit) part of it. \n\nProblem is, I would probably do the same, if only to prevent it from happening again in the future... So yeah, ESH, including me apparently.", "Sooooooo NTA.", "Info: If your sister wasn\u2019t working, how come the kids needed to go to summer camp, let alone a $9k one? \n\nWhen I was a kid, we *never* went to summer camp, that was only for the kids who had no one to watch them at home and we had a SAHM.", "Guessing the sister didn't disclose where the funds for camp came from."]}
