For your free day, have you been arranging these activities with your husband? As in the two of you discussing what to do, agreeing on it and then it's him bailing out?", "ESH - gently. Look, I know it's difficult to see when you're in the middle of it, but the problem seems pretty obvious. You both have different ways to relax. Your husband wants to spend this small opportunity for free time, just gaming and chilling. \n\nAnd that IS OK. But you want to spend your rare free time going out for hobbies, and that's ALSO OK. However, he isn't communicating his wishes properly until the last minute (when your hopes are up), when he should be. But you aren't giving any consideration to how your plans, are just what YOU want - not him. \n\nYou expect him to spend that small amount of free time, doing something he just doesn't choose to do. How is that relaxing for him? How would you feel, if he demanded you spend all that free time gaming with him, so you're 'together' (when that's NOT what you want to do)? \n\nYou both need to communicate with empathy, rather than just concentrating on your own wishes. Ask him to be HONEST (and don't get mad at his answer), about how often he would be willing to go out to a restaurant, hobby, whatsoever. Maybe it can be agreed something like 1 or 2 times in 4, and he gets to game the other 2 or 3 times (whilst you do something else - perhaps with friends, or whatever). \n\nOr he spends part of the day gaming, and the other part having a special meal at home/watching a MUTUALLY INTERESTING film/doing a MUTUALLY INTERESTING hobby together at home instead (so you spend time together). But you need to respect the way each other want to relax. He's not justified in not communicating, and letting you down the last minute. But ask yourself honestly - why does he feel unable to communicate with you at an earlier stage of the arrangement, that he just doesn't want to go out?", "INFO -\n\nDoes he agree and then cancel last minute? Do you split child care duties equally? Does he make alternative plans together?\n\nSounds like you two relax in different ways and his way doesn\u2019t involve you being in the same room.", "I think both of you are TA. You\u2019ve got young kids and you both need to relax. HOWEVER neither of you are communicating properly. YOU are making plans then getting annoyed at him for not wanting to go along with them. HE is TA for cancelling last minute yes, but YOU are one for not discussing this before hand and seeing if he is comfortable with it. Come up with a plan TOGETHER. Be a united front, and if you want to do things together, then plan it together. He can play games after having a nice dinner, that is perfectly plausible, but if you are planning this without checking in with him first, then you\u2019re dictating his free time. But if he isn\u2019t expressing this to you then that is also an issue. Anyone who doesn\u2019t communicate is TA", "NTA because he keeps agreeing to plans and cancels them last moment. He should communicate that he doesn't want to go out so you can make plans with people who want to spend time with you.", "Nta! \n\nBut...\n\nI think one of the best things you could do is compromise and communicate. Take it in turns, one week its downtime and he can play video games and you can do whatever, and the next you both make an effort to go out toegther. That way theres no more cancelling at the last minute and you both get to do what you want.", "Wow, um, you guys need to communicate. Relationships post babies require input.", "NTA. I\u2019m a mother and when my kids were young, if I had any \u201cme time\u201d I preferred to slob around the house doing nothing rather than dressing up and going out. \n\nYour husband sounds like he\u2019s the same as me. He should\u2019ve communicated this to you instead of agreeing to the plans then pulling out.", "NTA He showed no love or respect for you by repeatedly agreeing to and then bailing on your plans. He tried to make a joke of it but couldn\u2019t handle when you joked back. It sounds like he has a lot of growing up to do", "NTA. Next time you have a babysitter instead of making plans with your husband make plans with your friends instead. He might stop taking you for granted if he sees you going out and having a good time without him.", "NTA.  Sending that gram post was childish, and your response was totally within the context of what he sent to you.", "\"He played some video games and tried to console me\"\n\nSo he didn't even put the game down when you started crying? After ignoring your needs for a month straight? \n\nHe's the one who messed up repeatedly and found a way for you to be the \"bad guy.\" The video he sent to try to be funny would have pissed me off too. It's not an apology. Apologies have four parts, one is promising not to do it again. \n\nSo many women are filing for divorce these days because they do everything while the fathers ignore them in favor of video games. \n\nYou are not important to him. Your marriage is not important to him. \n\nI hope your husband enjoys hemorrhoids.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He's being overly sensitive given the circumstances", "NTA.  If he knew he was going to dick around at home playing video games he should have communicated this, not agreed to plans and then cancelled.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept that behavior from a friend, let alone my husband.  He's not showing you any love by doing this.\n\nIf you do want to stay married long term, you may need to find a friend to do these activities with because your husband is very unlikely to change.", "NTA though it may not have been a very appropriate thing to say.\n\nIs this how he normally treats you.  Even before you had a baby?  If this is new, he may have a form of PND himself and may need some help.\n\nIf he's his normal self and not actually suicidal then what he sent you was very inappropriate.\n\nBut you probably need to ask him how he's going, is he suicidal.  If he is, does he have a plan?  And get him some help.\n\nYou also sound like you need some help and support.. especially if you aren't getting anything from your husband and he's leaving you to cope with raising your child by yourself.", "Jesus Christ, NTA. Tired of hearing about men who think their lives shouldn't have to change when a baby is brought into the equation. If he wants to use one of those days to play video games then he should discuss it with you first instead of letting you down last minute. And it's certainly not fair that he gets to cancel on you 4 times in a row just so he can blow you off for what he wants to do. He's a big boy he can use his words if he wants to do other things and compromises can be made.", "NTA - your husband is acting like he is still single with no wife or child.  To constantly  cancel plans after they are made is extremely childish and your come back was absolutely perfect.  And it seems like he got the message.\n\n\"very disrespectful and showed no love to tell him to die.\"  How much love and respect has he been showing you lately?", "NTA\n\nHe is not your friend, let alone life partner", "NTA. He showed no love to you when he agreed to plans only to consistently cancel because he will *die* without video games. I hope the video games suck good d, since you no longer will.", "NTA, unless you give substantially more info here and I'm completely wrong about the set up of chores and responsibilities here. \n\nDoes he ever plan or organise anything for the two of you? What does the division of labour look like in the house?\n\nIt seems very much like the mental load for everything is falling onto you, and then he still doesn't want to participate in activities. \n\nLook, I love to game, and so does my partner. But playing video games every single night when you could be spending time with your spouse on the limited chances you're getting for downtime is unfair and means your needs for contact are being neglected. \n\nPeople recharge in different ways. People are also expected to adapt and change to the needs of others to make their family feel supported and engage in some activities that aren't their favourite dopamine junk snack. It's not like you're saying he can't game. All you're asking is that when he agrees ahead of time to engage in a non video game activity with you that he agreed you'd both do, to actually show up. \n\nSo yeah, NTA. I think you both need a serious conversation about quality time together and how it feels to be repeatedly blown off for gaming.", "ESH. You need to compromise. Some of the days off you do fun things together. Some days you do whatever you each like to relax.\n\nParenting is sensory overload hell and when I get a break sometimes I just spend a solid 20 minutes staring at a wall in silence. Sounds like your husband needs alone and quiet  time to recharge which is totally fine.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t consistently cancel on you last minute though, but equally you shouldn\u2019t consistently schedule every part of his free time. He probably shouldn\u2019t have sent the video so soon after the fight. You shouldn\u2019t have told him to die (can\u2019t believe I needed to type that).\n\nHaving a kid is incredibly hard on a relationship.  The pair of you need to sit down and talk regularly about how you\u2019re feeling, and what you both need from the other.", "'Sit on the toilet while on his phone for however long he wants ' versus hanging and having fun with his lady?\n\nWow, man of your dreams right there. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\nI enjoy gaming myself but when it negatively impacts your relationship with your family, you need to knock it on the head.\nIf he wants to talk about disrespect, he ought to take a look at himself and his behaviour. \n\nDisrespect is cancelling on your wife so you can sit in your pants playing with pixels on a screen. \nYour indignation towards his flimsy attempt at explaining himself with a stupid video is not disrespect. It's resentment that has built up because of HIS behaviour, and honestly that resentment is warranted.\n\nHe needs to fix up. His priorities are all out of whack.", "ESH. He shouldn't agree to go along with it, but you shouldn't force your way of relaxing on him.\n\nI have a new baby, too, and your day off sounds like a nightmare to me. Sounds exhausting. But luckily, my husband and I are both introverted and compatible with what we do to recharge. \n\nSo you should have a sitdown conversation and find something you both like or just separate for part of the day. But either way, lashing out is shitty.", "NTA.\n\nHe didn't send it to be funny, he was being dramatic. It's one thing that everybody has different needs when it comes to relaxing but if he doesn't want to go somewhere and would rather spend the time at home relaxing, then he can be a big boy and open his mouth and *talk with you* about it.", "Info: how many times prior to the ones he cancelled did he do the things you wanted to do?", "NTA. Just tell him if he has to play video games every night and cancels on you for them, then his marriage will die.", "NTA, It's okay to want to spend your day off in different ways but he has to communicate properly instead of canceling last minute MULTIPLE TIMES", "You love going out and he loves staying in. You keep booking he keeps cancelling, I think you guys need to talk. and btw both of you are somewhat assh*les.", "NTA\n\nAnd speaking as a gamer, he needs to get his shit together NOW.\n\nHe has an infant and responsibilities to that mutual LIFE created before any gaming or free time. Dude needs to get it through his head, his entire life has changed.", "NTA computer games are not real life. He needs to realise that his wife and children are way more important than any online game. Life will pass him bye, and he will end up alone with just his games console to support him in his old age.", "NTA he\u2019s neglecting you and then throws salt in the wound by sending you a funny video about it? He\u2019s a grown ass man with a kid are you serious. He\u2019s trying to play victim. \n\nTell him if he won\u2019t put any effort into maintaining a relationship with you, you may as well separate. He clearly prioritizes playing video games alone over you every single time. Doesn\u2019t sound like husband or father material.", "ESH.  Sounds like some compromising is in order.  You guys get a once a week child free day and that\u2019s great not everyone does.  But it sounds like you create a schedule every time.  Sometimes people just want to do nothing.   Can\u2019t it be a little of both sometimes, or one or the other?  You say the last four times he\u2019s canceled.  He\u2019s pretty strongly hinting that he needs some true downtime.", "ESH\n\nYou enjoy spending your free time going out to dinner, going shopping, doing hobbies, being active. He enjoys spending his free time playing video games and being by himself. There\u2019s nothing wrong with either of those.\n\nThe problem is he keeps cancelling on you last minute.

If you communicated your feelings of being hurt by the canceling than I do not believe you are but if you didn\u2019t, than it\u2019s on both of you.", "NTA he needs to grow up. It sounds like having a baby reverted him back to behaving like a child.  Smh. Good luck. But I would stop considering him my husband and go find a new partner to enjoy date night.", "NTA. You sure you want to be his wife? My husband used to work in games, and even he stopped playing after our first kid was born and didn\u2019t resume until the kid was almost one.", "If he's withdrawing like that, it's possible he's overwhelmed or even becoming depressed.

He's mocking your efforts at having date night and won't come out and say what he wants. You're hijacking his one night a week off with a bunch of stuff he doesn't want to do and you can't seem to take a hint. Stop making all these plans without him and ask him what he wants to do on these nights and then do that on some nights, then have date nights on others.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you need to learn to communicate better. Actually talk and listen to each other. You cannot walk around and let this anger stew and then lash out, it isn\u2019t healthy. And he can\u2019t just disappear into his video games as an excuse (saying you need to play every night is both childish and selfish, especially since you have a child together to take care of). My point is this: you both suck and you need to work on this together.

I swear video games are the male go-to when depressed.", "INFO how often does he get \"me time\" to just enjoy his hobbies?", "ESH.\n\nHe's in the wrong here and you're obviously right to be very frustrated but I think that answer is far too aggressive and goes way, way too far.", "ESH. It sounds like this is the only free time each of you have. It's not unreasonable to ask your husband to meet you in the middle. Designate some time for video games and some time to spend together. That being said, he sounds immature. And your response to his comment was equally immature. I don't think that implying that your partner should die is particularly funny, even if they're not being an awesome partner in that moment.", "NTA. He needs to fucking grow up. \nHe can still find times for video games. I raised a human being. I found time to read, watch movies, etc. Did I always have time for everything? Of course not! But that is what happens when you become a parent! My husband used to wake up at 5 to do whatever he wanted and I would stay awake until 12. Our sex life sucked, but our sanity thrived.", "And this is why I could never date a gamer. I don\u2019t understand the hobby and I don\u2019t like gaming. Gamers never grow out of it.

Neither is wrong, your needs are just mismatched. \n\nThis mismatch hasn\u2019t been communicated well, and his video was a weird way of trying to say he needs to stay in.

When you told him that he should just die, he experienced that as you saying \"my needs matter - your needs don't\". His interpretation of these signals is pretty reasonable and conventional.
