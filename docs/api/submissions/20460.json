{"id": 20460, "submission_id": "14htiqe", "title": "AITA for telling my tattoo artist friend I won\u2019t go to her anymore?", "selftext": "I (24f) have a good friend since high school (21f) and she recently became a tattoo artist under the tattoo shop she\u2019s been apprenticing under for a little less than a year. When she was still an apprentice she had asked to use my body as a practice canvas when she was told to do some real skin. I was really hesitant at first as she still had some shaky line work but she was my friend and I wanted to help out. The first 2 tattoos she asked to do she refused money for, but I still gave her $100 for one and $150 for the other even though honestly I really wasn\u2019t a fan, I just wanted to give her security. Her work meant something to me. \n\nFor a while after that she didn\u2019t ask to tattoo me until she suddenly NEEDED to tattoo this tiger bleeding flowers on me. I told her sure but I knew she had been tattooing for a couple months at that point so I asked her what she would like to charge. She told me $590. I was kind of taken aback when she said that price but this was a very pretty piece, it was just weird for her to charge that much when SHE wanted to tattoo ME so much. But alas, I let it go, and the tattoo turned out okay, not my fav, but still overall beautiful. \n\nWell finally she texted me yesterday and sent me this dragon and asked would she be able to tattoo this on me so she can add it to her portfolio. I told her yes, asked how big it was though as it would have to be in a weird spot on me and even though this design wasn\u2019t wide, it was long and would probably take the top of my thigh to the bottom of my knee. Then she told me \u201cI\u2019m available at on xx if that will work for you, we can get it fitted then. This piece I\u2019m thinking of pricing at $6,450 since it will probably take me two 8 hour sessions to complete if that works with you.\u201d IT DOES NOT!! $6k and you\u2019re reaching out to ME, your FRIEND absolutely not. I blew up on her, I called her out on her huge up-charge in prices, how I have really bad color fade in some parts of my previous tattoos already that she charged me $500+ on. She did not take my words well\u2026 to say the least she told me this WAS with a discount and even though we were friends she needed to pay for her art and time. It just made me go at it even more, reminding her she\u2019s not some experienced tattoo artist who has been in the industry for years and is highly sought after, and just because her paper art looks killer doesn\u2019t mean it translates the same on skin. She asked me if this means I don\u2019t want the design even if we talk about prices, and I told her no this means I\u2019m never getting tattooed by you again.\n\nAll of our mutual friends are texting me saying it\u2019s one thing to tell her no I don\u2019t want the tattoo and it\u2019s another to harass her about how she priced her art. The tattoo shops Facebook/Instagram have even gone as far as posting a \u201cfriends and family don\u2019t complain when you any paid fairly\u201d part to their page. I won\u2019t lie, it stings a bit and now I wanna know AITA?", "created_utc": 1687614431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14htiqe/aita_for_telling_my_tattoo_artist_friend_i_wont/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's an extremely high price for a tattoo unless she's a very well known artist.  Some of the best artists in my city charge much less unless it's an entire back piece or something. \n\nIf someone wants to pay her that, great!\n\nBut as you say... she came to you", "Good tattoo artists who have excellent work wnd been tattooing for 10 plus years can charge 500 plus for a tattoo. Just starting out and still learning no that's a piss take. You're not good enough to charge those prices.", "NTA bc girllllll whaaaaaat?! My husband is a tattoo artist and a really good one where I\u2019m from and he would never , ever say 6K for a tattoo HE wanted to do \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. It\u2019s tacky how this \u2018friend\u2019 kept reaching out to you for use of your skin. And that price is pure sticker shock.", "$800 per hour.  Is the artist Banksy?", "NTA I think? That's certainly not normal pricing where I'm from and even weirder because she's asking you to tattoo something for her to add to her portfolio. It's not like it's something you chose and requested her to do. Not like you were demanding anything of her at all. \n\nI have no idea how that could be a discount at all. Where do you live?!", "NTA. What the heck that is an insane price, I know award winning artists that charge 100 to 200 an hour, making that like a 3k tattoo at most, and she isn't award winning or even known.", "NTA, I have an 8 hour tattoo and it cost me $1200 AUD. It\u2019s amazing and held up for years. The artist is always booked out in advance too for months, how does a rookie artist think she\u2019s worth 6 grand??", "NTAish you blew up at her, but I can understand your frustration. I don\u2019t understand if she is tattooing you for her own portfolio why would she be charging you at all?", "NTA, that is absolutely insane pricing, even for the most experienced and sought after tattoo artists. Further, it sounds like she just wants to use you for shot that SHE wants to do on YOUR body.. Look into other, experienced, artists rates and show her how unreasonable her ask is.", "I would reply on the shops page \"your apprentice artist asked me to sit for a 16-hour tattoo, of a subject design that i did not choose, to fluff their portfolio, and is asking me to pay $400/hour for the privilege of doing them this favor. This is not appropriate business practice, so i will be taking my patronage elsewhere\" hopefully it'll make others reconsider taking their business to that shop. That's super sketchy", "NTA but I can't believe you've let this go on for so long. You were doing her a favor and you were paying her for it! You didn't even want the tattoos. It's crazy.", "NTA act all and you shouldn\u2019t have paid for any of the previous work either she sounds difficult", "NTA. Sometimes you need to unload on a friend to get through to them. If you hadn't been loud about the ridiculous price now, a stranger would have later.\n\nYou probably saved her some very public embarrassment. In my book that's being a good friend.", "My husband has been tattooing for 20 years. He would not charge that much. His day rate is $1000 if the person sits for 8 hours.\n\nOn top of that, she's inexperienced. And on top of that, she reached out to *you* because she needs to build her portfolio. \n\nShe can take a hike.", "She called you and begged you to pay her to put her Choice of tattoo on ypur body that seems really fucking backwards to me", "Well  \u201cfriends and family\u201d  don\u2019t have to pay through the nose to get something *they don\u2019t even want*, either. \n\nEspecially if the something is permanent, painful, time consuming, and, (from her earlier work), may degrade over time. \n\nShe came to *you*. If she wants a skin canvas to experiment/practice on/do for a portfolio, then she can generously offer her and her work to somebody *else*, and damn, even at a discount, she wanted a lot of money. Are you made of money that you can just drop it on something you don\u2019t really even want? I know *I\u2019m* not. NTA", "I'd let the tattoo place the facts, show them SS's of HER wanting to tattoo on you (if any) and not the other way around (which is likely what she told them).\n\nShow them the quality of her work on you and point out the problems with it given the price you paid last time (again on her request to tattoo you for her portfolio).\n\nAnd let your friends know that you are happy they are willing to pay $6k to tattoo themselves by your mutual friend.\n\nEdited to add: NTA.", "403,125 USD per hour - no, thank you", "NTA mostly, you have every right to complain about the pricing especially as she is eager to tattoo you and is using your body for experience. You don\u2019t owe her anything and you\u2019ve already helped and paid multiple times in the past to support her career. However, telling her she\u2019s not an experienced artist and isn\u2019t sought after, and criticizing her art skills was not necessary in my opinion, you could have just said no, especially if she\u2019s a friend and you care to keep her in your life.", "NTA. Sounds like she doesn\u2019t have near enough experience to be charging what she charges. I would expect her to to have at least ten years under her belt charging that much for a piece that size. And it\u2019s kind of weird to me that she thought you could just casually drop $6,000+ on something you haven\u2019t been planning for yourself for months???  I don\u2019t even have that much money to my name. I would shit a brick if someone asked me to pay that much for anything. Maybe your financial situation is a bit better, but that\u2019s still a HUGE investment on something you didn\u2019t even really want or need. You made the right call not going back to her. She was taking advantage.\n\n*Edited for typo\nAlso want to add that maybe this piece is extremely intricate and I could see that coming at a higher price, but that\u2019s not a price you just spring on someone for work they didn\u2019t even ask for.", "NTA she is totally taking advantage of you. She wants to tattoo you big tattoos you would not have gotten otherwise in order to help her portfolio? Ok then she should be paying YOU for experience definitely not charging you outrageous prices and expecting you to agree even on a 6.5k$ piece that you don\u2019t even seem like you really wanted", "you're not, she was taking you for a ride as a push over friend to begin with. 6.5k for 2 8 hour sessions of a tattoo that she approached you to get that she's chosen and designed?\n\nThe design time doesn't get paid for because she made the design herself and they looked for a subject. If you went to her with an idea and she took 10 hours coming up with that design with several attempts and adjustments to your preference then that time should be paid for, absolutely not when she's doing it and the design is her choice not yours. She's also using your skin to make a one off attempt to produce art for her portfolio. 6.5k, holy shit was she taking you for a ride.\n\nShe's probably misleading your friends on price and implying you asked for the tattoo, etc. \n\nI'd probably post on facebook about how your supposed friend asked you to get a tattoo from a new artist, overcharged and it's already got heavy colour fading and not great line work. Also that friends and family don't beg their friends to use their business then try to guilt them into massively overpaying.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Idk where OP lives but even the amazing tattoo artists where I live don't charge that amount for a tattoo. She's charging like $400 an hour.
