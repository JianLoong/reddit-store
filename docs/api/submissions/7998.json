I don't really like snakes or really the idea of pets outside of a cat, dog and maybe a horse in the future if we have the land. She said it was her dream to own a pet snake and I was not supportive of her dream but at the same time I asked her to support mine.

Yes, you told her up front about Canada, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s a huge upheaval of her life.

You cannot compare asking somebody to move to another country,  and all the upheaval that would cause to having a pet. If you'd said you were scared of snakes, or something like that,  I'd have understood. Wanting a pet is not a \"dream\" it is in no way comparable to yours. \n\nHowever,  I would say,  it sounds to me that you need to go to Canada.  If you don't it will fester and turn into something it isn't. I fear that you will forever hold it against her, if you don't go. That sounds closer to the root of this debate.

It is more than simply moving from Maine to Washington. OP doesn\u2019t seem to consider any of this\u2026and thinks that living with a snake he\u2019d never have to feed or handle (partner can do that) is much more cumbersome.", "IKR? It's bad enough that Canada has to live next door the US, now this dude is moving there.", "I would have to imagine that many places ban certain types of snakes. Invasive species, for example.", "They don\u2019t eat them regularly. I can say, as a lifelong cat owner, I have never had to go to or order from, a special shop to purchase them dead rodents to hand feed to them. They eat cat food. It comes in a bag. It\u2019s basically kibble. Sometimes canned food but it\u2019s never an uncooked, dead animal.", "I didn't say I wanted one I said I'd be open to having one.", "They are depending on where you live.", ">I didn't think it was a big stretch to say \"maybe we can move in this direction hours away from home\"\n\nWell you thought wrong. Moving countries, nationalities, cultures, is a HUGE ask, especially if you can't commit to still being with her in 5 years time. She'd just be wasting her time and money.", "You\u2019re young and are looking for your view to validated. You will understand some day. What people are trying to get you to see is maybe this relationship isn\u2019t compatible. If she doesn\u2019t want to go then she doesn\u2019t and if you don\u2019t want a snake you don\u2019t. The relationship isn\u2019t compatible. You two need to talk and get on the same page if you can\u2019t then break up. You would be the AH if you make her go with you. A relationship is about communication and compromise. If you can\u2019t see yourself spending your life with her don\u2019t make her move to a different county for your interests without considering hers. You talk like you are going to be together in 30-40 years. Do you see yourselves together for that long.\n\nEdit: missed the reply to another comment that you see yourself with her for a lifetime. If that\u2019s true then you would be more considerate of her dreams, wants and needs. Listen even if I don\u2019t particularly like/enjoy something my wife has in interests in something/wants to go to/do doesn\u2019t mean I say no or complain. I do those things because I love my wife and the look of happiness on her face brings me more joy than anything in this world. That\u2019s it from me I\u2019m out. Do whatever you want my guy.", "I assure you that kibble or that wet food is comprised of mostly all dead animal. Cats are obligate carnivores.", "You're getting into things that don't matter.  You just want a reason to fight and be right.  You're non-compromising and non-considerate.", "Okay but what if that cat was a tiger???", "You shouldn't own animals. You compared a pet snake to a tiger. You're far too stupid and immature", "OK. You know they eat dead animals too right?", "Cats and dogs NEVER have to eat uncooked, dead animals. That is not part of their diet and neither is cooking them for them unless you want to get fancy but hardly anyone I know gives their animals uncooked meat. This person is making a worthless argument with you in bad faith lol", "Toronto has a great pet shop called Menagerie, they often have snakes either to sell or that they are looking after for patrons. They have never to my knowledge had tigers, so I don't think your comparison holds up.\n\nComparing a tiger to a house cat might work, but you've said you're cool with that.", "Now you\u2019re just doubling down and refusing to accept YTA. You keep comparing things that are on opposite spectrums. A tiger vs a snake? Come on man. She wants a snake, you want her to move to a completely different country away from her family, friends, and home as if it\u2019s no big deal but her having a snake is where you draw the line? Dude, you just want her to do things you way and blindly follow your dreams but ef hers, right?", "Literally no", "What who said I can't commit I never mentioned that what are your talking about.", "I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s meat based. Arguing that they all eat dead animals is just a false equivalency when you consider method and mode.", " No. I just love kitties and hope that if OP likes them too, and somehow doesn\u2019t know you don\u2019t have to feed them exactly the way you feed a snake, he\u2019d give one a good home lol. There are a lot that need homes. Cats and dogs.\n\nETA: if I was arguing to be argumentative, my argument would have been directed at the person who made the comment I was arguing against. I was trying to tell OP you don\u2019t have to feed these animals the same way.", "A pet to another pet", "Here\u2019s a little biology for you:  Cats are obligate carnivores.  They are LITERALLY obligated (which means REQUIRED) to eat meat (CARNI means meat and VORE means to eat.  EVERY cat food is made of meat.  If you try to feed a cat on food that lacks meat, they will DIE of malnutrition.", "There are literally raw diets for dogs? And show dogs use them and lots of other people do it too. Raw diets are actually healthier for dogs too", "Ahh so OP is an extra dumb idiot for brining up the strawman of Toronto not allowing snakes as pets too.", "You were asked if you'd still see yourself with her in 5 years, and you didn't answer, just said \"people move all the time\".", "Horses and dogs aren\u2019t comparable. A fish and a cat isn\u2019t comparable. A bearded dragon and a hamster aren\u2019t comparable. Obviously a tiger and a snake are even more clearly \u201capples and oranges\u201d and not comparable.\n\nYou are being obtuse/intellectually dishonest and if you\u2019re a potential PHD candidate than you\u2019re smart enough to know better. You\u2019re twisting things on purpose to try and make yourself \u201cright.\u201d It\u2019s obvious.", "Faulty analogy: This is something that should have been covered in some of your college courses. It is OP\u2019s dream to live in Canada, which requires so much more than the snake. And OP doesn\u2019t have to even care for or feed the snake or touch the snake. Partner can do that. And they\u2019re pretty chill.", "I know they\u2019re healthy etc. I was just saying that the argument that cats and dogs \u201ceat dead animals too\u201d is useless here. That\u2019s like saying I eat dead animals so, it\u2019s the same as hand feeding a rodent corpse to a reptile. Some people aren\u2019t comfortable with that. Those two things are in no way relatable in context. \n\nIf you want, you can feed your dogs raw meat. But with reptiles, you don\u2019t really have much of an option there. If you\u2019re not comfortable handing a fuzzy little corpse to a pet, that makes sense. It even makes sense in the context that you\u2019re comfortable feeding a dog raw meat, but uncomfortable handling a rat corpse.", "What? Anon answer is not an answer I must've missed it but yes for a lifetime actually to answer your question."]}
