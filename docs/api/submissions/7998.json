I graduate this May and she'll graduate next May. I told her before we started dating 2 \u00bd years ago that it was a huge dream of mine to move to out of the states and to Canada for various reasons. I've been a huge Canadaphile (She looked it up and it's an actual word) for years now. I asked her if shed be willing to go with me after she graduated and she said she'd need to think about it. I said \"The choice is yours but I'd like for you to come after you graduate. (May 2024)\"\n\nYesterday an exotic pet show came to town and she was excited and went, and I was not as excited and opted not to go. She's mentioned it once or twice before, and I thought it might've been a spur of the moment \"oh that'd be cool to have\" but she has talked about having a pet snake. I don't really like snakes or really the idea of pets outside of a cat, dog and maybe a horse in the future if we have the land. She said it was her dream to own a pet snake and I was not supportive of her dream but at the same time I asked her to support mine. I said \"I'm not against you owning a snake as long as I never have to meet it\" like if it was kept at work or something, but I definitely don't want it living with me.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: My dream is to move to Canada and hers is to own a snake I asked her to come with me to Canada but I don't want a snake as a pet in our home AITA\n\nEdit: So she and I have already moved out of our parents place together away from our family for those suggesting that I am pulling her away from family. We live hours away from home and Canada is also hours away from home in the other direction we go to school in the South.\n\nEdit 2: She actually likes Canada and the people, she said she wouldn't mind living when we went to Montreal (try poutine if you haven\u2019t it\u2019s really good). But I think at the end of the day she still sees it as my dream.\n\nEdit 3: Look at the other comments and edits what do you want me to say I made a straw man?  I did I admit that but moving on the real info is in the post.\n\nFinal Edit: GF read the post we laughed at the comments she and said breaking up is a Redditors default life tip, and that as soon as I brought up the tiger I should\u2019ve known I was getting ripped to shreds (pun intended). She saw the YTA comments and saw the NTA comments and at the end of the day she would at least like me to try meeting snakes and being around them. Not comparable and understands I want this dream because I want a better life for her myself and any kids we might have.

Yes, you told her up front about Canada, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s a huge upheaval of her life.

You cannot compare asking somebody to move to another country,  and all the upheaval that would cause to having a pet. If you'd said you were scared of snakes, or something like that,  I'd have understood. Wanting a pet is not a \"dream\" it is in no way comparable to yours. \n\nHowever,  I would say,  it sounds to me that you need to go to Canada.  If you don't it will fester and turn into something it isn't. I fear that you will forever hold it against her, if you don't go. That sounds closer to the root of this debate.

It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable line to draw to not have to live like that. Additionally, nobody whose dreams consist of owning snakes ever gets *one* snake, that\u2019s just where it starts. Having reptile tanks is also a fire hazard. I could go on about the negatives for a long time. The smell. The germs. The electric bill spike. The lingering smell of dead animal when the snake didn\u2019t feel like eating their prey. The fact that an animal that should be wild is kept in a small glass cage for you to poke at. The biggest con is the anchor. My parents can\u2019t travel because nobody will pet sit a house full of reptiles. They\u2019re wasting their retirement because my mom just wanted one snake back in the day. She is perfectly content.

I was wrong; our tour group took a trip to Niagara Falls and actually heard one of the supervisor at Canada's border patrol  tell other officers to search our bus because \"There's no telling what **they** have stashed in their luggages and person\".

I used the word controlling because you said he didn\u2019t want *her having pets* as though he was making a decision for her about pets generally and not just disliking snakes. It just seems like you want this to be about the misogyny of a man keeping a woman from her dreams when he just doesn\u2019t care for snakes, the dream only being mentioned in passing and only described as a dream the moment the opportunity came up. He presented his vision much earlier and there was consensus the plan was out there, whereas the snake came up casually and was later presented a dream of hers.

That's putting words into my mouth. I wouldn't care if both were male or both females. This has nothing to do with either of their genders and if anything you are making this a gender thing.\n\nOP has stated that she doesn't want her getting a pet snake because its a lifetime thing despite a move and settling in Canada being a much more permanent thing.\n\nOP has also stated he doesn't want her getting a snake because of its \"up to 40 year lifespan\" (paraphrased). Except the common snakes used for house pets usually have a lifespan between 15-30. Long, yes, except dogs can also have a lifespan between 12-20 so the issue of a lifespan is a mute point since both are still long. If lifespan is such an issue surely he should also be against dogs too?\n\nIts essentially \"I don't want you having a snake because its a snake\" because he won't like it which is frankly stupid. She is making a huge sacrifice for his dreams yet he is unwilling to do a much smaller sacrifice for hers. Part of them reaching a consensus for his dream is her willingness to sacrifice her support system in the US for him.

They need more regular feeding, clean up, and social interaction. Snakes do need clean enclosures, but they don't eat that often and don't require nearly as much interaction as a cat does.
