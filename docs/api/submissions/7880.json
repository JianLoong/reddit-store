Maya had the most amazing time with her cousins and we did the best to ensure that we'd get a priest who also trained a bit in shaving hair so she was comfortable and didn't cry. The only time she cried was when everyone left lol! I'm so glad that I didn't cancel especially after reading that one comment saying that I'm racist for doing this ceremony for my daughter, ESPECIALLY since she's black too. Still don't understand the thought process behind that.\n\nWe had a great day with our family and Maya was so glad to see her uncles (My brother and Cousin) who also flew out from the US for the ceremony.\n\nBut it seems like our day was too good and MIL called us screaming seeing the pictures my relatives posted on Instagram. She wasted no time this time around and went for her actual reason for being so against all this, as many of you suspected, she was still resentful that my husband married a Hindu. She somehow expected me to raise my daughter Christian, which totally blindsided me. FIL was also pretty much on her side. This time around, my parents also came and spoke to her because they did not like how she was talking to me and my husband was being a complete wuss (Leaving that for later rn). We kind of diffused the situation for now and I'm so glad my parents are still there for me.\n\nOh and the most surprising part!!! SILs told me MIL had herself shaved her daughters hair when they were toddlers since no stylist would work with kids that young in their area. Husband kind of remembered it too after they mentioned it. So she pretty much had no problem with the Hair shaving. I guess the resentment was just building up with Diwali, Holi (I mean seriously?? Who gets mad at seeing their grandkid covered in colours).\n\nThe most horrible thing was the skin bleaching comment. As someone who has been in the other side of it, It felt horribly awful that someone would outright say that I would have any role in it. The thing I'm angry most about is the audacity of her to call me up and scream about all this, like I would have responded well (maybe not but better than this) to a nice conversation. I don't know if I want this woman around my kid. But that's a problem for later.\n\nEverything was very Indian soap opera-ish for me so well it's been a long day.\n\n[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gzwh0/update_aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters/)", "created_utc": 1674273135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hhy8l/update_aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Oh the irony of the MIL shaving her own children\u2019s head. At least it sound like the SILs are on your side!\n\nStay strong OP! I\u2019m glad you have a compassionate family and are showing Maya the beauty of her culture on both her father and mother\u2019s side. Prejudice is awful, but I hope your husband and his family outside of the PILs do not tolerate that hatred. She already has been shown to have a great mother!", "I'm glad your mundan (we call it mottai) went well. Apparently I threw a tantrum and had to be bribed with sweets, lol. It's one of the best memories my family has. I remember the sweets only. \n\nIf your husband was being a wuss you need to figure stuff out on that front. You are a family unit now but it seems his mother's racist/religionist feelings are a priority over you being treated with decency.", "> a priest who also trained a bit in shaving hair\n\nNGL, was **_not_** expecting to read that phrase today.", "Awww, I'm so glad there was an update, and the ceremony went well.\n\nSorry to hear there's still tension and drama with the family. There certainly seems to be a lot there, cultural differences being a big challenge.", "I was raised Christian, but not Catholic, and now my husband is Buddhist-ish (celebrates occasions, prays, but doesn't fully practice with regularity.) Both my parents have been indignant or highly offended about my exposure to anything but the faith they raised me in. Attend a Catholic friend's wedding? DON'T KNEEL DURING MASS, DON'T TAKE COMMUNION! (I wouldn't take Catholic communion, but I am not going to act weird during their service!) And oh gosh, knowing I'd gone to a monastery for prayers or that our child has... fucking yikes on bikes. It would be better if we never shattered their illusion that we're good Christians who attend other churches than they do... but imagining our daughter chanting and spinning prayer chimes, knowing she has prayer flags hung in her room from Nepal, they're very bothered. Your MIL might feel the same. Your daughter's Hindu experiences make it impossible for her to pretend.", "Wow. Your husband needs to step up. \n\nAlso, just goes to show that anyone can be racist, even a black grandma against her mixed granddaughter. Maya is half black AND half Indian. \n\nRacist grandma needs to readjust her views on your cultural traditions. Maya can participate in both cultures' traditions!", "This has all the elements of a traditional saas-bahu mega serial!", "Loved this update, until the end. Time to cut MIL out of the picture until they fully apologies big time to you and your entire family.  Hopefully your husband is man enough to do what needs to be done if necessary. I wish you and your daughter nothing but the best going forward.", "I would LOVE for any grandchild of mine to be involved in celebrating Holi! I've seen the color part of the celebration on TV, and it looks like SO much fun! Hell, I wouldn't mind throwing on some old clothes and participating myself.", "This is why we were never supposed to mix", "Yeah, I\u2019m so glad to hear the ceremony went well, but you now clearly have a husband problem that needs to be sorted ASAP, OP. It sounds like your parents aren\u2019t always going to be around to shout down your MIL\u2019s xenophobic bullshit, and you need to make sure that he\u2019s going to be willing and able to step up on that front when the time comes.", "Since it's a religious ceremony, the priests are the ones who shave the baby's hair! We had to look for one who has a bit experience because the rest just freestyle when they see the baby's head lol", "Thank you!", ">Your daughter's Hindu experiences make it impossible for her to pretend.\n\nSince the phrase she used was \"Satanic worship\" I'm bound to believe this is true.", "A lot of Christians are really weird about Catholics! I do not understand it.", "We're going to have many *interesting* conversations this week", "Many people aren't even aware Hinduism has priests.  Congratulations!", "Well that's certainly quite a take....\n\nI'm **very** glad you plan to have some convos with your husband about his family, because this shit needs to be shut down yesterday.", "Oooof. Good luck, OP <333", "OP, have your husband ever warned you about his parents' blatant racism? If not, then it's pretty possible that he have internalize some of that hatred and genuinely doesn't see how big of a deal what they did is.", "I\u2019m ready to talk about your husband now. He needs to step it up!", "Sigh. I'm sorry she tried to ruin the experience and I'm sorry she attacked you. Remember it's okay to hang up on people who are abusing you unless and until they can speak to you respectfully and civilly. You are going to have to give serious thoughts to boundaries because you can't allow her to tell your daughter you're racist or that your religion is evil or whatever she might do.", "I don't remember anything about my mottai, but I remember my sister BAWLING through hers at Tirupati and causing a massive scene. It was genuinely entertaining to watch people peep at her with concern, while our family just chilled around, being over familiar with her dramatics\ud83d\ude02", "My thoughts exactly", "This was literally what I was thinking while reading it. Good luck OP! Very glad to hear the mundan went well! My parents had to give me ladoos so I didn\u2019t cry through mine \ud83d\ude02.", "She sounds a lot like my MIL. We eventually had to go NC because her complete disrespect for our desire not to press our child into a religion before she's old enough to study and understand them for herself. That, and just being all around narcissistic and hateful toward me. (She thinks I led her baby boy astray, refuses to acknowledge that his indifference to christianity existed before I came along.) \n\nGood luck, and I'm glad you got to celebrate your culture with your child.", "It's not uncommon for some Protestant Evangelical Fundamentalists to differentiate between themselves and Catholics by saying that they aren't Christian. (Which makes me wonder who they think the dude on all the crucifixes is supposed to be.) This would be the side of the family whom I credit with why I'm an atheist. I did not win points with that one.\n\nFor the record, my Presbyterian Minister Uncle on the \\*other\\* side of my family was a great guy, and what I would consider a good Christian, simply because he wasn't a massive AH.", "Catholics are the original Christians going back to St Peter, but there is certainly a huge divide between fundamentalists and Catholics in the USA.", "The KKK used to harras and kill catholics, partly because they were seen as foreign, since most american catholics are descended from italian, irish, and eastern european immigrants who came long after the country was established.", "Oh it\u2019s a whole ass thing. It comes down to fundamentally four reasons (this is literally just an overview and not nuanced at all): \n1. The Pope was incredibly politically powerful in Medieval Europe well into the 1600s. He was the puppeteer of sovereignty, dictated society and social mores, you name it. The Reformation was born in large part due to the resentment of the masses to this scale of influence. \n2. The clergy was the gatekeeper of God. Martin Luther\u2019s Ninety Five Theses, which launched the Protestant Reformation, addressed two main themes: the greed and control of the Vatican and its puppet royals over Catholics, and the fact that the only way a person could have a relationship to God was though a priest. Example: mass was said in Latin, something the majority of the population could not speak. This was also the time of indulgences, where people could pay their way into heaven.\n3. Works vs. Grace. Catholics believe that in order to get to heaven, a person must be good and do good. Christians (which is a catch all phrase that excludes Catholics but includes all other Christian denominations) believe that everyone who accepts Jesus as their savior is saved and will get into heaven merely by God\u2019s Grace.\n4. Many Christians view Catholics as elitist and ritualistic. Several monastic and sisterhood orders are founded in educational principles, and monasteries and convents have been sources of schooling for ages (ex: Jesuits, School Sisters of Notre Dame). Partly because of that, Catholics are the highest education Christian denomination. Also, there is a sense of history and ritualism to a Catholic mass that is seen as almost blasphemous by some Christians.", " I guess you have a lot of experience for dealing with that thanks to Balaji! \n\nSaas bhi kabhi bahu thi coming to the rescue! \n\n(Never thought I\u2019d type that, but her we are) \n\nAnd good luck to your husband, he\u2019s about to understand what an Indian family meeting looks like, hopefully he\u2019ll never be a wuss again!", "I hope you'll have deep conversations with your husband, cuz if this happens again and he doesn't stand up for you, I'm not sure how this will work. So good luck!\n\nAnd congrats on your daughter's mundan!", "I suppose you're not allowed to post another update, are you? I got some popcorn here that could use some more entertainment!", "Good luck!", "Congrats, dude! You got good parents. Hope your husband can back you up against his parents as well in the future! MIL seems very salty that her husband left her religion", "With respect, areyou sure your husband is just a wuss? I mean that's a problem in itself but a bigger problem would be if part of him agrees with his parents. Make sure he isn't having regrets and hasn't spoken to his parents about the issue before.\n\nI hope it's not the case but people can be strange about religion and if something has made him reconsider his stance, you need to know", "So glad to see you went through with it and didn\u2019t lose this precious milestone celebration with your daughter over someone else\u2019s ignorance!", "God the skin-bleaching comment alone is so infuriating and deeply xenophobic. So glad you did the ceremony, OP! MIL needs to understand that your daughter is ALSO Indian and she cannot try to deny that part of her heritage in favour of her own. The whole thing stinks of racism and xenophobia.", "Maybe MIL felt she was forced to shave her kids' heads when she didn't want to because she wasn't a hairdresser and no one in the area wanted to handle black hair on kids. So there could be some memories of racism (or perceived racism) toward her and her family, too. \n\nDoesn't make her actions ok in the slightest, but maybe adds another layer to why she reacted so strongly?", "NTA.\n\nI had  my  mine done at 7 years old as my parents were fleeing a military coup in Africa at the time.  By the time we were settled in the UK and other cousins had been born and raised, that when we had ours done.  Trust me, explaining the ceremony to a very white headmistress was difficult for me as  child, in the middle 1970s,  and my mum was called up to the school with Social Services in tow as the school thought I was being abused!!\n\nI found an article which I feel best explains it, see below.\n\n\"Mundan called Tonsure in English is the act of shaving the baby's first hair on the head. The tradition is considered important in Hindu tradition mandatory. During the mundan ceremony, a barber is assigned the task of shaving off the baby's hair. In Hindus, the mundan ceremony is done between four months to three years of his birth. In Islamic tradition, it's done between 7 to 40 days.\n\nThe time and rituals of mundan are different in different communities. In fact many communities only perform the mundan ceremony for boys and not girls. The ceremony is performed by a priest or the father of the baby.\n\nAfter the mundan ceremony, the head is cleaned with holy water and then turmeric and sandalwood paste is applied to heal the cuts caused during the process.\"\n\nFor Hindus, there's also an element of cutting the hair off as it came from a former life, but the article explains it better than I can.\n\nOriginal article https://m.timesofindia.com/life-style/parenting/first-year/mundan-ceremony-here-is-the-scientific-reason-behind-it/amp_etphotostory/76073110.cms\n\nAs for your MIL, she sounds insecure and a little silly.  She needs to educate herself, otherwise goodness knows what nonsense she will fill little Mayas' head with!\n\nGood luck with the ear piercing \ud83e\udd2a,  MILs' going to go crazy!  I would recommend getting it done whilst you're still in India!!", "Nobody needs to be a hairdresser to style their kids hair, MIL was just lazy", "I think the number of people with curly or coyly hair who have been shamed for their hair or taught that it's a hassle to deal with or to teach them would disagree with you. There are tons of people who are  just now learning how to take part of them that has been shamed.", "I think they call them barbers?", "Idk how this relates to mil being so lazy she shaved her kids hair off instead of learning to do it herself..", "You said not having a hairdresser is no excuse and it's lazy not to do your own hair. I am pointing out that it's not that simple- in the last 10 to 15 years, the amount of resources has exploded for people with curly or coily hair oo learn how to take care of it, and that historically end today, there's a lot of shame and chaos built into the way that people are taught to regard their own hair.  Am I missing something?"]}
