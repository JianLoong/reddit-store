Maya had the most amazing time with her cousins and we did the best to ensure that we'd get a priest who also trained a bit in shaving hair so she was comfortable and didn't cry. The only time she cried was when everyone left lol! I'm so glad that I didn't cancel especially after reading that one comment saying that I'm racist for doing this ceremony for my daughter, ESPECIALLY since she's black too. Still don't understand the thought process behind that.\n\nWe had a great day with our family and Maya was so glad to see her uncles (My brother and Cousin) who also flew out from the US for the ceremony.\n\nBut it seems like our day was too good and MIL called us screaming seeing the pictures my relatives posted on Instagram. She wasted no time this time around and went for her actual reason for being so against all this, as many of you suspected, she was still resentful that my husband married a Hindu. She somehow expected me to raise my daughter Christian, which totally blindsided me. FIL was also pretty much on her side. This time around, my parents also came and spoke to her because they did not like how she was talking to me and my husband was being a complete wuss (Leaving that for later rn). We kind of diffused the situation for now and I'm so glad my parents are still there for me.\n\nOh and the most surprising part!!! SILs told me MIL had herself shaved her daughters hair when they were toddlers since no stylist would work with kids that young in their area. Husband kind of remembered it too after they mentioned it. So she pretty much had no problem with the Hair shaving. I guess the resentment was just building up with Diwali, Holi (I mean seriously?? Who gets mad at seeing their grandkid covered in colours).\n\nThe most horrible thing was the skin bleaching comment. As someone who has been in the other side of it, It felt horribly awful that someone would outright say that I would have any role in it. The thing I'm angry most about is the audacity of her to call me up and scream about all this, like I would have responded well (maybe not but better than this) to a nice conversation. I don't know if I want this woman around my kid. But that's a problem for later.\n\nEverything was very Indian soap opera-ish for me so well it's been a long day.\n\n[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gzwh0/update_aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters/)", "created_utc": 1674273135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hhy8l/update_aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Oh the irony of the MIL shaving her own children\u2019s head. At least it sound like the SILs are on your side!\n\nStay strong OP! I\u2019m glad you have a compassionate family and are showing Maya the beauty of her culture on both her father and mother\u2019s side. Prejudice is awful, but I hope your husband and his family outside of the PILs do not tolerate that hatred. She already has been shown to have a great mother!", "I'm glad your mundan (we call it mottai) went well. Apparently I threw a tantrum and had to be bribed with sweets, lol. It's one of the best memories my family has. I remember the sweets only. \n\nIf your husband was being a wuss you need to figure stuff out on that front. You are a family unit now but it seems his mother's racist/religionist feelings are a priority over you being treated with decency.", "> a priest who also trained a bit in shaving hair\n\nNGL, was **_not_** expecting to read that phrase today.", "Awww, I'm so glad there was an update, and the ceremony went well.\n\nSorry to hear there's still tension and drama with the family. There certainly seems to be a lot there, cultural differences being a big challenge.", "I was raised Christian, but not Catholic, and now my husband is Buddhist-ish (celebrates occasions, prays, but doesn't fully practice with regularity.) Both my parents have been indignant or highly offended about my exposure to anything but the faith they raised me in. Attend a Catholic friend's wedding? DON'T KNEEL DURING MASS, DON'T TAKE COMMUNION! (I wouldn't take Catholic communion, but I am not going to act weird during their service!) And oh gosh, knowing I'd gone to a monastery for prayers or that our child has... fucking yikes on bikes. It would be better if we never shattered their illusion that we're good Christians who attend other churches than they do... but imagining our daughter chanting and spinning prayer chimes, knowing she has prayer flags hung in her room from Nepal, they're very bothered. Your MIL might feel the same. Your daughter's Hindu experiences make it impossible for her to pretend.", "Wow. Your husband needs to step up. \n\nAlso, just goes to show that anyone can be racist, even a black grandma against her mixed granddaughter. Maya is half black AND half Indian. \n\nRacist grandma needs to readjust her views on your cultural traditions. Maya can participate in both cultures' traditions!", "This has all the elements of a traditional saas-bahu mega serial!", "Loved this update, until the end. Time to cut MIL out of the picture until they fully apologies big time to you and your entire family.  Hopefully your husband is man enough to do what needs to be done if necessary. I wish you and your daughter nothing but the best going forward.", "I would LOVE for any grandchild of mine to be involved in celebrating Holi! I've seen the color part of the celebration on TV, and it looks like SO much fun! Hell, I wouldn't mind throwing on some old clothes and participating myself.", "This is why we were never supposed to mix", "Yeah, I\u2019m so glad to hear the ceremony went well, but you now clearly have a husband problem that needs to be sorted ASAP, OP. It sounds like your parents aren\u2019t always going to be around to shout down your MIL\u2019s xenophobic bullshit, and you need to make sure that he\u2019s going to be willing and able to step up on that front when the time comes.", "Since it's a religious ceremony, the priests are the ones who shave the baby's hair! We had to look for one who has a bit experience because the rest just freestyle when they see the baby's head lol", "Thank you!", ">Your daughter's Hindu experiences make it impossible for her to pretend.\n\nSince the phrase she used was \"Satanic worship\" I'm bound to believe this is true.", "A lot of Christians are really weird about Catholics! I do not understand it.", "We're going to have many *interesting* conversations this week", "Many people aren't even aware Hinduism has priests.  Congratulations!", "Well that's certainly quite a take....\n\nI'm **very** glad you plan to have some convos with your husband about his family, because this shit needs to be shut down yesterday.", "Oooof. Good luck, OP <333"]}
