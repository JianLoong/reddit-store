Maya had the most amazing time with her cousins and we did the best to ensure that we'd get a priest who also trained a bit in shaving hair so she was comfortable and didn't cry. The only time she cried was when everyone left lol! I'm so glad that I didn't cancel especially after reading that one comment saying that I'm racist for doing this ceremony for my daughter, ESPECIALLY since she's black too. Still don't understand the thought process behind that.\n\nWe had a great day with our family and Maya was so glad to see her uncles (My brother and Cousin) who also flew out from the US for the ceremony.\n\nBut it seems like our day was too good and MIL called us screaming seeing the pictures my relatives posted on Instagram. She wasted no time this time around and went for her actual reason for being so against all this, as many of you suspected, she was still resentful that my husband married a Hindu. She somehow expected me to raise my daughter Christian, which totally blindsided me. FIL was also pretty much on her side. This time around, my parents also came and spoke to her because they did not like how she was talking to me and my husband was being a complete wuss (Leaving that for later rn). We kind of diffused the situation for now and I'm so glad my parents are still there for me.\n\nOh and the most surprising part!!! SILs told me MIL had herself shaved her daughters hair when they were toddlers since no stylist would work with kids that young in their area. Husband kind of remembered it too after they mentioned it. So she pretty much had no problem with the Hair shaving. I guess the resentment was just building up with Diwali, Holi (I mean seriously?? Who gets mad at seeing their grandkid covered in colours).\n\nThe most horrible thing was the skin bleaching comment. As someone who has been in the other side of it, It felt horribly awful that someone would outright say that I would have any role in it. The thing I'm angry most about is the audacity of her to call me up and scream about all this, like I would have responded well (maybe not but better than this) to a nice conversation. I don't know if I want this woman around my kid. But that's a problem for later.\n\nEverything was very Indian soap opera-ish for me so well it's been a long day.\n\n[ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gzwh0/update_aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters/)", "created_utc": 1674273135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hhy8l/update_aita_for_planning_to_shave_my_daughters/", "score": 891, "replies": ["Oh the irony of the MIL shaving her own children\u2019s head.

And oh gosh, knowing I'd gone to a monastery for prayers or that our child has... fucking yikes on bikes. It would be better if we never shattered their illusion that we're good Christians who attend other churches than they do... but imagining our daughter chanting and spinning prayer chimes, knowing she has prayer flags hung in her room from Nepal, they're very bothered.

It comes down to fundamentally four reasons (this is literally just an overview and not nuanced at all): \n1. The Pope was incredibly politically powerful in Medieval Europe well into the 1600s. He was the puppeteer of sovereignty, dictated society and social mores, you name it. The Reformation was born in large part due to the resentment of the masses to this scale of influence. \n2. The clergy was the gatekeeper of God. Martin Luther\u2019s Ninety Five Theses, which launched the Protestant Reformation, addressed two main themes: the greed and control of the Vatican and its puppet royals over Catholics, and the fact that the only way a person could have a relationship to God was though a priest. Example: mass was said in Latin, something the majority of the population could not speak. This was also the time of indulgences, where people could pay their way into heaven.\n3. Works vs. Grace. Catholics believe that in order to get to heaven, a person must be good and do good. Christians (which is a catch all phrase that excludes Catholics but includes all other Christian denominations) believe that everyone who accepts Jesus as their savior is saved and will get into heaven merely by God\u2019s Grace.\n4. Many Christians view Catholics as elitist and ritualistic. Several monastic and sisterhood orders are founded in educational principles, and monasteries and convents have been sources of schooling for ages (ex: Jesuits, School Sisters of Notre Dame). Partly because of that, Catholics are the highest education Christian denomination. Also, there is a sense of history and ritualism to a Catholic mass that is seen as almost blasphemous by some Christians.", " I guess you have a lot of experience for dealing with that thanks to Balaji! \n\nSaas bhi kabhi bahu thi coming to the rescue! \n\n(Never thought I\u2019d type that, but her we are) \n\nAnd good luck to your husband, he\u2019s about to understand what an Indian family meeting looks like, hopefully he\u2019ll never be a wuss again!", "I hope you'll have deep conversations with your husband, cuz if this happens again and he doesn't stand up for you, I'm not sure how this will work. So good luck!\n\nAnd congrats on your daughter's mundan!", "I suppose you're not allowed to post another update, are you?

MIL seems very salty that your husband left her religion", "With respect, areyou sure your husband is just a wuss? I mean that's a problem in itself but a bigger problem would be if part of him agrees with his parents. Make sure he isn't having regrets and hasn't spoken to his parents about the issue before.\n\nI hope it's not the case but people can be strange about religion and if something has made him reconsider his stance, you need to know", "So glad to see you went through with it and didn\u2019t lose this precious milestone celebration with your daughter over someone else\u2019s ignorance!", "God the skin-bleaching comment alone is so infuriating and deeply xenophobic. So glad you did the ceremony, OP! MIL needs to understand that your daughter is ALSO Indian and she cannot try to deny that part of her heritage in favour of her own. The whole thing stinks of racism and xenophobia.", "Maybe MIL felt she was forced to shave her kids' heads when she didn't want to because she wasn't a hairdresser and no one in the area wanted to handle black hair on kids.

By the time we were settled in the UK and other cousins had been born and raised, that when we had ours done.

The tradition is considered important in Hindu tradition mandatory. During the mundan ceremony, a barber is assigned the task of shaving off the baby's hair. In Hindus, the mundan ceremony is done between four months to three years of his birth. In Islamic tradition, it's done between 7 to 40 days.\n\nThe time and rituals of mundan are different in different communities. In fact many communities only perform the mundan ceremony for boys and not girls. The ceremony is performed by a priest or the father of the baby.\n\nAfter the mundan ceremony, the head is cleaned with holy water and then turmeric and sandalwood paste is applied to heal the cuts caused during the process.\"\n\nFor Hindus, there's also an element of cutting the hair off as it came from a former life, but the article explains it better than I can.\n\nOriginal article https://m.timesofindia.com/life-style/parenting/first-year/mundan-ceremony-here-is-the-scientific-reason-behind-it/amp_etphotostory/76073110.cms\n\nAs for your MIL, she sounds insecure and a little silly.

I remember friends having done that.\n\nWhen we did my sons ceremony in a temple in India, his dad let the priest take some of his own hair as well (he did not want a complete shave because of his work in the US), and they convinced me to give up some of my hair too. I\u2019m an atheist, but I was always pretty compliant with the Hindu traditions that they wanted me to do while we were still married, so I let the priest cut a strand of hair too.", "My parents were Lutheran, so the bias against Catholicism is baked in to the core of the faith since the start. My dad said things that were weird and doomsday/apocalyptic about the Antichrist for my entire childhood. I never understood until I was a teenager and really asked for an explanation which again got weird, but I realized he believed the Pope was the Antichrist and would bring the downfall of humanity. I had already had a crisis of faith because I was trying to reconcile science and the Bible when he went full creationism is not a myth on me. It really made it hard on me to believe anything when there was no room for metaphor in the text. He insisted it was literal. \n\nMy dad didn't follow the Bible consistently but there were times I can say he was deeply, Jesus focused and did things that I was proud of. My mom's family church was taken over by an awful person after the original pastor retired. So much so that despite his retirement, my mom's family still had no qualms about asking him to perform baptisms, first communions, weddings and funerals rather than the new guy. The new guy respectfully stepped aside. But my dad was asked to physically leave the church on three occasions when he took issue with the preaching of the new guy as un-Christian and evil. He wasn't banned from the church but he was livid about the un-Christ-like behavior and the pride of the pastor when retelling his elitest, unwelcoming behavior. Like my dad stood up and denounced the pastor denying baptism to a single mother's baby because she didn't seem sincere in her desire to raise her child going to church. Or the time he used my aunt's marital situation as fodder for his sermon in ways that embarrassed my grandma in front of the church. \n\nBut my dad concluded the new guy was ex-Catholic so he must have been there to lead us astray. When he was outed as attending Catholic \"pray away your gay feelings\" support groups my dad was relieved to be right that the guy was still Catholic. I was like... but that's what you took from his crazy ass anti-gay preaching since we moved to a church with my dad's side of the family?", "You're more than a decade late, don't doubt that I clarified with my parents and did what I knew was right. They don't believe kneeling is an appropriate way to express faith and insisted it was inappropriate for me to do. I didn't listen because it was not my intention to act weird at my friend's wedding. I didn't take communion and they knew I wouldn't, but they also believed visiting any other non-Lutheran church was risking me converting. Because my friends coming to church with me wasn't about camaraderie to them, they really expected them to convert.", "At that time, it wasn't as easy. If the girls are 19 we're talking about a childhood in the mid 2000s; that was when availability of products and knowledge about natural hair was only beginning to rise.

It can be said that culture is passed down matrilineally and the OP\u2019s MIL may be lashing out because she feels as if her culture is being erased or made secondary and not equal to her granddaughter\u2019s Hindu heritage. I think OP and husband should have a heart to heart with both sets of inlaws to map out ways BOTH cultures will be represented in their family.

However, we were shocked when he did this, simply because in our caste we don't usually follow anything like that (we would carry out a ghonee, where we would feed a certain amount of children in thanks) but his wife was a different caste to us and that's what they believed,  so that's how they showed their gratitude.    It all comes back to the same thing really.", "Nope, not here! But this is a whole mess and I think I'm going to frequent relationship advice too with the way things are looking right now", "They're priests who are only involved in removing the child's hair for this particular tradition. Don't know why you felt this would be appropriate to comment.", "On the one hand, I'm really glad you have no experience with this being out of the ordinary and that you think this is outlandish.  I am always a fan of the moment that someone is fortunate enough to not have realized that they were, and I realize that sounds patronizing and I apologize for that, but it is not always the case that a parent or caretaker, even with the same type of hair, is willing to try or teach or even guess how to take care of marginalized bodies. Correct, you do not need to be a hairdresser nor have  we Black and brown folks just discovered hair products, but it's rather dismissive to suggest that folks just know or figure it out, especially without acknowledging the historical, cultural, and plain longstanding issue that has existed about coils and curls, in and out of the personal home."]}
