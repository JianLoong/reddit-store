She's insecure about the fact that she failed. I kinda get where she's coming from but also feel a bit offended by it because I didn't pass well in high school so I did two courses over 3 years which would make me eligible to do the degree and I also had to get a job while studying full time to help pay for things. During all this time she hasn't done anything besides chilled at home as her parents pay for everything.  The more I consider it the less I feel like posting or even going to my graduation. I never told her about how I feel but she keeps telling me how unfair graduations are for people like her and that she also deserves to be celebrated because she's had it way harder than people like me who are handed opportunities. \n\nWIBTA if I go to my graduation and post about it regardless of how she feels?", "created_utc": 1677403688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ca3zz/wibta_if_i_post_my_graduation_photos/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And a real friend should be happy for you too in my opinion", "NTA\nShe wasn't provided the opportunity? Seriously? She's done nothing and is doing nothing. Except wallowing in self pity and is denying you your bragging rights.\n\nYou weren't provided  the opportunity either! You worked your arse off for it! I don't know you and I'm proud of you! \n\nGo to your graduation, take a ton of pictures! You deserve the acclaim and congratulations of others for your hard work and dedication! \n\nPost your achievements and let her wallow!", "Cry me a river.. she should get off her ass and start attempting to do something with her life or bite her tounge. You celebrate your accomplishment and all your hard work. She can keep scrolling if she doesn't want to see. No assholery here!", "NTA. Saying people who are \u201cprivileged\u201d enough to go to get a college degree shows that she doesn\u2019t value the hard work you put in to getting your degree. By staying at home with her parents footing the bill, she is the privileged One who could have gotten her GED (in the US) and gone to school, with possibly her parents footing the bill for that as well. She is jealous and insecure, and there\u2019s no way you should not go to your graduation and celebrate by posting pictures. She doesn\u2019t have to look at them, or you can just block her. I would definitely reconsider that friendship.", "NTA. You should absolutely celebrate your accomplishments. You weren't handed a degree, you worked hard for it. \n\nShe should be happy for you, not dragging you down. Reconsider your friendship. I didn't graduate college, but I was super happy for my friends and family who did. Don't worry about people like that. Find people who will cheer for you, no matter what.", "NTA... Let her know you will be posting all things that are important to you, and are milestones (grad,marriage, babys,....) But that you will be sure to mention in the post that you are greatful for the good friends/family that have supported along the way.", "NTA. Your friend is not a friend! Friends love and support each other. She should be happy for you because you reached a milestone. The fact that she tried to diminish your accomplishment by focusing everything on herself is very telling.", ">she keeps telling me how unfair graduations are for people like her and that she also deserves to be celebrated because she's had it way harder than people like me who are handed opportunities.\n\nI'm sorry, we're you handed the opportunity? Did you not take extra courses to make up your high-school, work hard during your years of schooling to earn the bachelor's degree, and put effort into your success? Was that all handed to you? No, you earned it, and you deserve to celebrate your hard work.\n\nFurthermore, what perceived hardship does she have to celebrate? The trials and tribulations of leaching off her parents?\n\nNTA", "NTA you should be proud of what you achieved and worked hard for.  She has choices she could still attend college and make up for the schooling she missed if she is choosing not to do anything tgats on her.  Don't diminished yourself for the sake of others.", "Nta, celebrate your milestone, you earned it\n\nIf she can't be happy for you, she is not your friend", "NTA. \n\nYour friend sucks tho, you should let her go. Sounds like she wants to pull everyone into the pit with her. It's only her fault that she hasn't done anything productive with her life. \n\nJealousy is normal, but telling people they can't celebrate their achievements because you want to wallow is just selfish as all hell.", "NTA. This is a her problem.", "Definitely NTA. You deserve to celebrate your hard work and self investment. She failed school and that's her fault alone. Like you said, you also struggled to finish highschool and you made it happen anyway, she didn't. Maybe this might actually be a wake up call for her get off her ass and do something finally. Either way, not your problem. Enjoy the accomplishment, congratulations!", "OMG tell her to get real. Celebrate your life for goodness\u2019 sake. Congratulations. NTA", "NTA.  That's not a driend, and I would not be friends with this person.  Choose your friends carefully.", "NTA.\nDo not let others put down your effort, hard work and value.\nEven if it would have been the case someone else had paid your studies for you, you did the studying.\nIt wasn't handed to you for free.\nI hate this privilege bs, yes. Some have it harder than others.\nBut nothing stopped your friend from working hard to try to achieve her dreams.\nBut no she failed.\nHer failure does not mean you don't get to celebrate your success.\nWhat's next? You getting married and not allowed to post about it because she does not have a fiance or the privilege of a relationship or a wedding?\nOr you have a kid, she does not have the privilege t being a child into this world?\nCelebrate your success, and if she cannot celebrate with you. She is not your friend.", "NTA. Someone somewhere will always have less than you or not been able to do what you have. There is no reason to not celebrate your victories due that. \n\nThe most I would do is warn her since she's been honest. \"Hey I know you said you didn't want to see my graduation pictures, so I wanted to let you know I'll be posting them this week in case you'd like to turn off my Instagram notifications\" or whatever. But even that is up to you. \n\nI flunked out of college due to mental health and I would never tell someone not to be proud of and share their college accomplishments. Good for you! It's hard work. Be proud.", "NTA she has the attitude of, 'if I can't do it, then no one can.' Instead of trying to be supportive, she is trying to tear others down. She cannot prevent others from doing things, because she can't. It is jealous, sabotaging and insecure. You are allowed to be loud and proud about your own achievements. In life, rule of thumb is, 'do not pander to the crazy.' Logical decisions always trumps people's feelings.", "You should celebrate your hard work. Post your photos, write it in the sky, shout it from the rooftops. Celebrate your achievements. You only live once.

Well done.", "NTA, I had a friend once who was all pissy about me celebrating the end of my bachelor degree because she had to finish it in 4 years instead of three like me. She said it wasn\u2019t fair I was celebrating in front of her because she was sad it was taking her longer, but I worked hard for my degree and she chose partying. In the end I decided to accommodate her and not say anything about it and I regret it. Don\u2019t let someone rain on your parade.", "NTA - go to your graduation and post those pictures.  You've earned this.  Someone who's had their parents pay for everything has no right to speak of others being handed opportunities.  She is just jealous - and not your friend.", "Her issues aren't your issues.
