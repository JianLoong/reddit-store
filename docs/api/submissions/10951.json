She's insecure about the fact that she failed. I kinda get where she's coming from but also feel a bit offended by it because I didn't pass well in high school so I did two courses over 3 years which would make me eligible to do the degree and I also had to get a job while studying full time to help pay for things. During all this time she hasn't done anything besides chilled at home as her parents pay for everything.  The more I consider it the less I feel like posting or even going to my graduation. I never told her about how I feel but she keeps telling me how unfair graduations are for people like her and that she also deserves to be celebrated because she's had it way harder than people like me who are handed opportunities. \n\nWIBTA if I go to my graduation and post about it regardless of how she feels?", "created_utc": 1677403688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ca3zz/wibta_if_i_post_my_graduation_photos/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re allowed to be proud of yourself and feeling the need to share.     \nYour friend probably wouldn\u2019t mind sharing her travel pictures to, let\u2019s say, Japan even if it was your dream destination and you didn\u2019t get a chance to go.

OH!, and my neighbor isn't allowed to post photos of their new car cause our other neighbor doesn't make enough to buy a brand new car.\n\nBottom line, it's absolutely selfish and ridiculous to ask someone to completely hold back on their celebrating a life goal/event because THEY didn't get to.", "NTA.

Whether school was hard for you or not, you had to put in the time and effort. She could have gone to a trade school, gotten her GED, all sorts of things in the same amount of time.

Always toot your own horn with shit like this. You graduated, you worked hard, post the photos and show off a little. If she\u2019s salty over it, she\u2019s not supportive and not a real friend.

You worked hard. Celebrate the win. Friends who can\u2019t celebrate your wins aren\u2019t friends.

Go to your graduation, you've earned it in spades and post the photos and be proud of what you've achieved\n\nYour friend has made this story all about her, not about your achievements - taking makeup courses to get your grades up to enable you to go to college, working to pay your bills while studying etc. so I don't see how you got your education 'handed to you'\n\nIf she gets upset about this its because she realises she has just wasted the last five or six years of her life and hasn't achieved anything.

She has her own insecurities to work out and should work on herself if she wants to be celebrated. You worked hard and deserve to post whatever you please and shouldn't have to feel guilty and second guess yourself. If she gets mad that's on her for being a selfish friend and not cheering you on. It won't just be about this, usually they always find a way to make situations about themselves.", "Isn't this being what social media is for? To show others how well you are doing, regardless it is true or not (not that yours isn't true). Celebrate your achievement and post it. It's your life and your social media.
