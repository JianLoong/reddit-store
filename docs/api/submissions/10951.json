She's insecure about the fact that she failed. I kinda get where she's coming from but also feel a bit offended by it because I didn't pass well in high school so I did two courses over 3 years which would make me eligible to do the degree and I also had to get a job while studying full time to help pay for things. During all this time she hasn't done anything besides chilled at home as her parents pay for everything.  The more I consider it the less I feel like posting or even going to my graduation. I never told her about how I feel but she keeps telling me how unfair graduations are for people like her and that she also deserves to be celebrated because she's had it way harder than people like me who are handed opportunities. \n\nWIBTA if I go to my graduation and post about it regardless of how she feels?", "created_utc": 1677403688, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ca3zz/wibta_if_i_post_my_graduation_photos/", "score": 549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Post the pictures and ditch the \u201cfriend\u201d", "Why would you NOT go to your graduation because this woman can't pull herself together?  She's NOT your friend-- friends like to celebrate you and your success.  Go to your graduation post TONS of photos and be proud of your accomplishments.  If she wants to be celebrated she needs to get off her rump and do something worth celebrating.   \n\n\nNTA unless you actually dont' go to graduation or go and don't post then you would totally be an AH  \n.", "NTA but I am confused as to why you even think you might be an A H or why you think what your friend is saying makes any sense", "You should be PROUD of your accomplishments!

You should definitely go to your graduation and shout it to the world!  Congratulations!", "NTA, Friends own decisions and behavior put her in this position, not OP\u2019s priviledge.  So sick of these winters\u2026she can get off her ass and do better and be in OP\u2019s position.  Why can\u2019t people accept responsibility for their own actions anymore. There re many who have nothing but make themselves something instead of having a pity party.", "Wait. You had to work a job while studying to afford it - and you were \u201chanded opportunities\u201d while she stayed at home bc her parents pay for everything - and she had it \u201cway harder\u201d? How?\n\nObviously you wouldn\u2019t be the AH! You deserve to celebrate your success and your friends should be proud of you and celebrate with you even if they don\u2019t share your success. Bc they should be happy for you\u2026 congratulations btw:)\n\nedit: NTA (not sure how the bot works - do I have to put it in capitals for it to count or is my previous statement ok when I wrote in words?)", "NTA\n\nYou were not \"handed\" anything! You worked really hard to get where you are and you deserve to celebrate all your hard work! Post the darn pictures!!", "NTA\n\nYou earned the degree, celebrate it.", "NTA\n\nYou worked hard for your accomplishment. You deserve to be celebrated for it.", "Are you effing kidding me?? So, let me get this straight. You busted your butt to earn a degree with the opportunities presented to you, and your miserable witch of a friend cannot find it a good thing? Totally NTA!! I didn\u2019t graduate high school, either. I haven\u2019t been able to go to college. But damn, when my friend got her PhD, I was thrilled! Just because I\u2019m not able to get one, doesn\u2019t give me the right to shit on a happy moment.", "NTA.  She's addicted to the victimhood drug.  Your successes have nothing to do with her failures and she should be happy for you.  If she refuses to do anything about her lot in life that's on her.", "One of my two best friends from high school didn't get to go to uni after school when I did through circumstances beyond her control. \n\nIt was rough emotionally on her, and I know she felt jealous, but not once did she make me feel bad about it. She even made a point of coming to my graduation even though she lived about 6 hours away. Our life paths have been very different, but our friendship has remained strong for decades. There are times I've envied her as well - like when she and her husband bought a house and I was years away from that - because I'm human. But I was also really happy for her and bought her an awesome housewarming present.\n\nFriends support each other. They don't project their insecurities onto each other. They help each other through the bad times and they celebrate each others wins.\n\nYour friend's insecurity should not stop you from celebrating a significant achievement and milestone in your life.  This graduation is about you and not about her and that is the way that it should be. Go to your graduation. Celebrate your success. Post your photos. \n\nNTA", "NTA, not everyone deserve a \u201ctrophy\u201d good grief.

I\u2019d get her out of my life if I were you. She is an energy suck.", "NTA - she has as many opportunities to put things right, study and get an education now as you or anyone else. Her inability/refusal to put her own life in order does not constitute a reason for you to deny the positive things you have achieved in yours. Talk about tall poppy syndrome. What a thoroughly unpleasant person who doesn\u2019t want to celebrate her friends success or maybe she\u2019s just not your friend", "NTA. Her lack of accomplishments should not stop you from showing your friends and family what YOU have accomplished! \n\nCongratulations!", "NTA. She can get her GED. She can enter the workforce. There are plenty of things she can do and it's toxic that she's resorting to trying to dull your sparkle to make herself feel better.", "NTA. wealth inequality is totally unfair, but that doesn't mean people can't celebrate graduating? I had to drop out of college because I couldn't keep up with both work and school and I needed to pay my bills and survive first and foremost. It's totally unfair that some people don't have to work through college at all and can just focus on school. That doesn't make graduating less of an accomplishment or something that they shouldn't be allowed to celebrate, even if it makes me sad that I don't have the same opportunities. I'm usually anti the \"well life is unfair\" sentiment because it's generally used to excuse cruelty but... life *is* unfair. It's also unfair to blame someone who didn't create the unfairness in any way for that and expect them to hold themselves back or not celebrate their achievements because of it. All you have to do to not be an AH about the inequality is not hold the same expectations for her as someone with more support and to not sound like one of those articles that claims poor people can't have anything nice that makes them happy or it's their fault they're still poor, and to not exploit poor people if you run a business or \"invest\" in real estate.", "You've outgrown your friend.  No judgement on your friend, she is where is at this time in her life and hopefully she'll mature in time.  Keep celebrating yourself and moving forward, even if it means leaving her behind.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA! GO TO YOUR GRADUATION!! POST EVERY PIC YOU HAVE IN YOUR CAP AND GOWN. Your achievement has nothing to do with your friend. She should be able to be happy for you even while she wants something different for herself. Never let anyone tell you not to be proud of yourself.", "Celebrate your accomplishments", "NTA.\n\nFor starters, your 'friend' had the same opportunities you did. She was in high school, and for whatever reason failed. You apparently didn't do so well either, but instead of sitting around mooching off your parents like she did, you put in hard work to *achieve* your degree. You earned it. And you should be damn proud of that.\n\nRegardless, though, of whether this woman was at a disadvantage or not, she is being a terrible friend. A good friend doesn't look at their friends' achievements and shit all over them just because they're jealous. A good friend hypes you up, helps you celebrate. You have every right to share the news with the whole world if you wish to, and most decent people will celebrate with you. Hell, plenty of us in the comments are proud of what you've accomplished! Post whatever you like, and if she makes a fuss over it then maybe reconsider her as a friend.\n\nAlso: Congratulations!! \ud83e\udd73", "Screw that!  You've earned not only your degree, but the right to post about and show the world!\n\nCongratulations!  And definitely NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nGo to your grade you will regret it if you don\u2019t.

You have every right to post it and not feel any shame in doing so. You\u2019re proud that you\u2019ll be graduating, as you should be. If this \u201cfriend\u201d can\u2019t be happy for you, she\u2019s not a friend. Friends don\u2019t do this.

Celebrate your accomplishments. College is hard. I am finish my BS in Accounting this May. It sucked but wohooo.\n\nPost as many pictures as you want. \n\nMy suggestion? Find new friends that will celebrate your success with you.", "Go to your graduation, post lots of pictures, be excited and proud of yourself. And more importantly dump the \"friend\" who isn't happy for you. She's not your friend. Congratulations on your accomplishment! Edited to add. Ywnbta.", "I've never heard of crab bucket syndrome but it's possibly my new favorite thing ever.", "Piggybacking on top comment to say--I was  not privileged enough to go to college. I was little mom to my younger siblings, and my mother made it pretty clear that I wasn't college-bound by the time that I was sixteen; she refused to assist me with my FAFSA when I tried to attend later on (and guess what, you're not considered financially emancipated in the US until you're 24, married or enlisted), and after that life just got too much in the way.\n\nI *exult* in my friends' academic accomplishments. One of my best friends is shortly to finish a doctorate; I want to send her presents about it.\n\nAny friend who can't be joyful for your gains is, bluntly, a shitty friend."]}
