There's plenty of good reasons you need to know. What if there was an emergency at daycare and you had to get your child?", "NTA.

Concealing that information is in clear violation of your custody agreement. Tell your lawyer.", "NTA you literally have a legal right to know", "The fact that she won't tell you despite legally having to tell you seems extremely suspicious. Talk to a lawyer as soon as possible. NTA", "Show her the legal agreement and tell her if she refuses to cooperate youll involve the case worker/judge. \n\nNTA. \n\nMy guess is that shes probably leaving the child with someone you wouldnt approve.", "NTA. Remind her of the verbiage in your custody agreement, should solve the problem pretty quick otherwise it\u2019s lawyer time.", "NTA - If she protests again lawyer the fuck up", "ESH.  Your ex is being shitty for refusing to disclose the childcare information in violation of the existing court order.  You're being shitty because you want to tour the facility, you're not saying it, but the reason is probably because you want to approve it or try to exert some other control over your ex and who she uses for childcare.  \n\n\nIf you feel strongly, file a motion for contempt order in the court against her.  However, you don't have a right to dictate to her what childcare she chooses, if they're licensed in your state, she gets to pick who she wants.  You would need a legitimate reason to object to a caregiver, such as criminal background to win this argument in court, not just \"I don't like the facility when I toured it\".", "NTA. The court order says you\u2019re entitled to this information. Personally I think the reason she\u2019s refusing is because you said you want to take a tour of the facility. She probably thinks you want to do that so you can find a reason to veto her decision. However she should put those fears aside and give you the name of the daycare.", "NTA\n\nThis is literally outlined in your custody agreement", "If it's listed in your arrangement then Nta", "NTA \n\nSounds like she doesn't want to follow the court order. File contempt and file for right of first refusal.", "NTA.  Also, is it in your custody agreement that either of you have a right of first refusal?  She wants daycare so she can go out?  That makes zero sense...daycare so she can work, that I'd understand.  If it's daycare so she can go out and party, I would think maybe you'd want to have your kid during the time she wants to go out and party.", "You don't need AITA, you need a lawyer for this.", "NTA - doesn\u2019t get any easier than this one", "NTA - it is you job as a parent to ensure your child\u2019s safety, talk to your lawyer and ask about \u201cfirst right of refusal\u201d ,  it means she can\u2019t leave your kid with anyone before asking if you want them first.", "NTA - but I feel sorry for your child. They are obviously growing up with parents that are going to have a hard time communicating and if a simple thing like this is an issue, I can't imagine what happens when a real issue comes up.  You both are setting up your child for lots of emotional issues.  I hope the 2 of you figure it out.", "INFO: Why do you want to tour the facility? Your agreement is that she provide you with contact information, but not that you get to meet/tour the child care provider.", "Nta. \n\nShe has to listen to the custody agreement. \n\nTell her that if she doesn't want to tell you. Then you will have to contact your lawyer.", "Info\n\nDid you just ask that or did you say something along the lines of:  my chikd isn't going anywhere I don't approve of?", "It's okay for you to want to know where your child will be going to daycare when they're with your ex-wife. You both agreed to share this information in your custody agreement. Your ex-wife is not following this agreement by not telling you. It's important for both parents to know where their child will be and make sure it's a safe place. If your ex-wife won't tell you, talk to her about it calmly and remind her of the agreement. If that doesn't work, you might need legal help, but it's important to always think about what's best for your child :)", "NTA. Even without an agreement, if you share custody you both have a right to know who's looking after your toddler and where. This a totally reasonable request.", "NTA.", "Yes", "Obviously NTA. She has a legal obligation. On top of that, it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "NTA and if she won\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s contempt of court.", "NTA. Grab a lawyer quick, and the fact that she's refusing to tell you strikes me as extremely suspicious.", "Depending on the custody situation the daycare may not be allowed to contact the non custodial parent for that time frame. So it doesnt necessarily matter if his name is down for an emergency contact. Theyd essentially act like he didnt exist. \n\nBut that doesnt mean OP shouldnt know where his child will be.", "Holy assumptions batman. \n\nIts literally in their legal agreement and he has a right to know where his child will be. If it was a licensed safe facility then she wouldnt care about telling him. I doubt its a safe place if shes refusing to share the info.", "I appreciate the feedback. All I care about is the safety of my kiddo. So, I want to know where she will be sending him so I can do due diligence as my child\u2019s father to make sure he is going to safe and reputable place. Is she sending him to a daycare? Or to a random person\u2019s house? I have no clue.", "You really are just pulling assumptions out of your ass here.", "Yes, we have the right of first refusal as well in our custody agreement along with no alcohol or drugs during custodial time.", "Seems like OP's ex is the only one who won't communicate.", "It seems pretty normal for a parent to want to know about the place where their child will be spending a lot of time, even if they trust their co-parent.", "Even if he doesnt tour it, their legal agreement says she needs to tell him.", "I would like to see whatever facility it is and do my due diligence about it to make sure my child will be going to a safe and reputable place.   He is not potty trained as well.So, I wanted the contact information so I could contact the facility or place myself.", "She mentioned that she wants to send our kiddo to daycare so she can go out. I asked her if she could let me know where she is sending him  so I can tour the facility our son will be going to. If it\u2019s not a safe facility I would want to bring my concerns to her and if chooses to send our kiddo anyway that\u2019s up to her. But atleast I did my due diligence as our child\u2019s father.", "100%! I just want to know where my kiddo will be going to be sending a lot of his time is a safe place.", "I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s an actual daycare and not some random person\u2019s house.", "Ah, I wasn\u2019t aware of that. Thanks for informing me. /gen And I agree, even if that\u2019s the case, he has the right to know where his child is.", "As I said, she's being an AH for not following the court order.  OP is indicating he desire is to tour the facility, which indicates AH and controlling behavior.  Not that he wants to check their credentials, not that he wants to look at their license.  But he wants to tour the facility, which indicates he has some control issues and wants to exert his opinion on her decision on a facility to use during her residential time.  Am I assuming, yes.  Does that make me an AH, quite possibly.  We don't know her reasons for not telling him, not enough info, given the court order language from OP, it doesn't indicate any issues with stalking or protective orders.  However, having seen this kind of language from multiple exes in the past, there's more here than OP is letting on about, and his desire to tour the facility is saying way more behind the scenes.", "Genuine question: if you would still let your child got to this facility even if you didn\u2019t like what you saw, why tour it at all? Isn\u2019t the goal to prevent your son from going someplace where he won\u2019t be properly cared for?", "Got cha. Soft NAH. But you know exactly how you said it and I'm positive it wasn't as reasonable as this.\n\n\nCommunicate your concerns through parent talk  and ask for the address there. Otherwise her refusal is just your word against hers. I'd also recommend you take co- parenting classes together so you learn how to communicate effectively. AITA isn't going to give the best advice. Too many bitter incels and weirdos in her present company included.", "Yeah. Me too. But if its just for her to go out (not to go to work etc) then its probably not a regular day care since those are usually only open during typical work hours", "How is it controlling to want to see that his child isnt being sent to a crack den? \n\nId want to tour a facility my child was spending time in too if my partner and i were co parenting. Thats not controlling thats called being an attentive parent.", "Some day cares have late hours to accommodate parents who work the night shift. I know a woman who turned her basement into a fully functional licensed daycare and she was available to her clients 24/7 as long as they gave her advance notice.", "We had our son at an in-home daycare that was registered and working on getting fully licensed. She had a couple of kids who were often over-nighters because of their mom's work schedule. As long as she knew in advance, she could accommodate unusual schedules, which is great for parents who have shift work and can't use traditional daycares.", "Right. Lets hope its a place like that."]}
