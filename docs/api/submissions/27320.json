That\u2019s ridiculous.

I\u2019m always happy for the married couple, but ultimately it\u2019s their day, not mine, and the dress is just another dress to me (and usually not one I like lol). \n\nYour SIL is unreasonable for expecting you to keep a dress for a quarter century that was worn once when you were 16. If she was that worried about it, she should have asked for all of the bridesmaids to give them to her for safekeeping, and let them collect dust in her own home. It\u2019s also outrageous to expect that after 25 years, people would still fit into those dresses. I know I have clothes from a few months ago that don\u2019t fit me, I can\u2019t imagine having stuff for 25 years ago. \n\nDoes your SIL keep the bridesmaids dresses from every wedding she was in?

And it seems that if you're there you have to be dressed in the same outfit but not the case if you're not, no matter the reason.

Ridiculous.  Clearly there are other issues in this relationship if they are being this insane over a dress, that you own, and have every right to do with what you want.", "NTA. It\u2019s a totally normal thing to get rid of a dress you didn\u2019t pick out and will never wear again. \n\npeople are sooooo weird about their weddings, it\u2019s so creepy, ugh.", "NTA. This is completely ridiculous. It\u2019s been 25 years for goodness sake!", ">She was incredibly hurt that I would discard \"such an important memory\". My brother then disinvited me entirely saying that I had no right to get rid of the dress because my mom bought it so \"it wasn't really yours\" and that they (my brother and SIL) should have been notified and given first dibs when I decided to donate it years ago because it was such an important part of their memory of that day\n\nWell Yikes!! \n\nWho knew 25 year old satin/taffeta puffy sleeve with ruffles dresses held such sentimental value. So much so they didn't even ask to have it so that THEY could keep it. They just expected you to raise, feed, nurture and drag it around every single place and time you moved for the past 25 yrs -  unable to be destroyed or donated. \n\nThey are both being ridiculous. NTA", "NTA. They seem a bit insane to think that EVERYONE cherishes their wedding day like they do. \n\nAs someone has already stated, you were a TEENAGER then. You are 25 years older, as THEY ARE!\n\nLordy!", "NTA. Who deludes themselves that their wedding is an important memory to anyone but them?", "You didn\u2019t have it mounted on acid free matboard, put into a shadow box frame, and protected with UV glass while it hung in your foyer to greet your guests?\n\nFor shame. Just. I can\u2019t even. You are dead to me, and I don\u2019t even know who you are (anymore).", "She expected you to hold on to a bridesmaids dress you wore as a teenager for TWENTY-FIVE years??? Your SIL is delusional and your brother is worse. I mean, I\u2019m not even thirty yet but I know damn well that I don\u2019t have a prayer of fitting into something I wore at 16 ever again. I get that their wedding was special to them, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone around them has to cling to every physical moments of the day until the end of time. NTA at all. Sounds like you dodged a bullet by getting uninvited. Can\u2019t imagine why nobody ever in the wedding party will be there./s These people sounds exhausting.", "Ridiculous.  I couldn't wear a dress from 25 years ago - and I was an adult then, not a teen.  I mean, I suppose I could technically wear such a thing, but it wouldn't be zipped up at all.  Maybe everyone is going to show up like that - pants unzipped, buttons popped off, the sound of fabric ripping as they start to dance.", "How in the hell could anyone fit into a dress they wore when they were 16, 25 years later??", "NTA. If the dress the bridesmaids wore were going to have somuch sentimental value for her, she should've asked for them after the wedding.\n\nI have one friend who has been in a TON of weddings, and from what I understand, she has only kept 3 former bridesmaid dresses. And that's only because they were of a style where she could (and has) wear them again for formal events.\nI dont even have my wedding dress anymore. I sold it online after about 6 months because it was taking up space in my closet and I thought it eould be good for someone else to get some use out of it.", "What the. You are NTA. 25 years is a loooooong time to hold onto a bridesmaid dress, even if you haven't moved. She's a bit bonkers imo, especially since she uninvited you because of it. Wild.", "NTA. Some people have trouble understanding \"important to me\" does not equal \"important to everyone.\"", "That\u2019s so strange! You\u2019re definitely NTA. People don\u2019t keep clothes for that long\u2026 I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid 7 times and have 2 of those dresses still - both because I actually like them and hope I get to wear them again. The other five went long ago (one went immediately because it was honestly vile!). I feel like you\u2019re getting punished for ruining an instagram moment or something - I hope your brother sees sense soon.", "NTA. You were a teenager, would the dress still fit? If this was something they wanted to do in future, they should have told your mom and asked for the dress. You were a teenager. What would your mother have done with a dress bought to fit you?\n\nHer wedding was important to her, she cannot expect it to be a core memory for anyone else other than your brother. The fact you were the \"only bridesmaid\" that could come speaks volumes. Seems the others found excuses to stay out of this mess of an anniversary party. I doubt they would have kept a dress from 25 years ago. \n\nI have no idea what my bridesmaids did with their dresses. My wedding was over a decade ago and I gifted the dresses to them.  I would be really surprised if either of them still have them.", "THIS. I can't imagine that many of the guests still have that outfit from f***ing 25 years ago! WTH were they thinking?", "None of the other bridesmaids could come before OP was disinvited. I can imagine SIL ranting about how she was betrayed by the 4 of them at the party.", ">Also also -- it's been 25 years, and you were a TEENAGER.  Would the dress even still fit?\n\nNo, no it wouldn't. Even if OP happens not to have given birth, a middelaged body is nowhere close to a 16 year old body. Hell, I am 28, *only* 3 kilos heavier than I was at 16, have not had kids, but my body shape has changed drastically. Even if I'd lose that extra 3 kilos, I'd still not fit into my high school clothes. This girl's got hips now, and my boobs have definitely grown since and that's not the extra weight doing it. And I definitely have that tummy pouch our female bodies make after a certain age *just* in case we get pregnant that I definitely didn't have yet at 16.", "Tbh I think the real party idea is showing that SIL wedding dress still fits her after 25 years whereas the bridemaids dresses no longer fit them! (that is expected for 16 years old girls at the time). OP getting a new dress similar to the former one obviously ruins this...", "I very much doubt it - 16-18 was when my skeleton spread out. I'm not even talking about weight, my ribcage got wider and so did my pelvis. My one formal dress from when I was 16 stopped zipping over my ribs at 20. (Also I went up like two cup sizes, so.... that would be a whole thing \ud83d\ude2c)", "And now we know why no other former bridesmaids are going \ud83d\ude02", "Right???? I don't think I can name a single person who has clothes that old that they don't wear in their closet, let alone who fits the clothes they wore 25 years ago.", "And your mom bought all your clothes!", "I\u2019ve gained 60 pounds since I was 16. There is NO way I could fit into that bridesmaids dress.", "Wait, what? You mean you don't reach into the future minds of your in-laws to know what they're going to want you to wear to parties in a quarter of a century and prioritize those desires every time you edit your closet? How can you live with yourself!\n\n/s", "I\u2019m in my 20s and there is no way in hell I could wear a dress I wore when I was 16. \n\nWhile I do still have the junior bridesmaid dress I wore at 16, it would be insane if the bride asked me to wear it again even for their 10th anniversary.", "I do have one dress from 25 years ago. But I was a baby then and my mom kept it since it was made by her mother. \ud83d\ude02 OPs brother and wife are delusional thinking she should\u2019ve kept a dress from when she was 16. And who says the dress would even fit now? Most people don\u2019t have the bodies they had at 16 anyway.", "I have my baby clothes. Well, technically, my mum does. She likes to take it every so often and go on about how small I was.\n\nI can use that to segway into how small my brother was. He was about 4 weeks premature and was the size of a baby chicken\n\nMy sister does have dresses from 12 years ago, which she only wore once, which I could never understand", "I know there is a box in the depth of my parents attic with 30 year old clothes - school uniform, gymnastics leotard etc. They could probably do with a dose of MK though! I helped them clear out a few years ago and lost my mind when I found a box of TEETH. Fucking grim - I threw them out.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m not really sure what the etiquette is with bridesmaids dresses. I have a bunch in my cupboard I need to get rid of but now I\u2019m thinking I might check in with the brides first haha. I also have the wedding dress my friend had for her first wedding which ended horribly. She\u2019s remarried and I have no idea how to bring up the dress and what to do with it.\n\nI also suggest that OP may need to consult a doctor if she\u2019s the same size she was at 16! Maybe very petite people would be ok? I was a lanky bean pole that didn\u2019t fill out until my 20s, then over filled in my 30s. I could wear a dress i wore at 16 as a scarf?", "She absolutely does fit into her wedding dress and she wants everyone to know it.\n\nNTA", "I'd honestly be shocked if the other bridesmaids/groomsmen still had their outfits NTA", "Even if OP had the dress, it's unlikely that it would still fit.  I was a bridesmaid about 10 years ago, and although I still have the dress it doesn't fit anymore.  I'll probably donate it soon, just haven't gotten around to it yet.", "Yeah being disinvited is very much a don't you threaten me with a good time sort of reprieve from my pov. You just know the sil is going to be wearing her old dress or something, the difference being she had probably finished puberty completely when she got married. As if a dress from when you were 16 was ever going to fit at 41 she's outta her mind so it's totally bullet dodged there for op I reckon.", "Yeah, I have a bridemaids dress from when I was 18.  I tried to wear it last year to a friend's wedding only to discover my hips grew way more on the last 10 years than I would have thought.  I'll probably donate the dress soon because I don't think my hip bones are going to shrink or anything.", "Are you the SIL? lol", "No\u2026the idea of offering a bridesmaid dress you don\u2019t want anymore to the couple is not a thing. That\u2019s super weird. I have absolutely no idea if any of my bridesmaids from 13 years ago still have their dress, and if they offered it to me I would be baffled.", "Our bridesmaids have never offered theirs back.  And what would I do with two identical dresses that won't fit me?", "Congratulations, you and OPs SIL are the only two people on earth who think like this. \n\nAlthough with your comment history I gotta say, I still don't believe any actual people on earth think like this.", "And they really need to consider their reaction.  You can't easily take back harsh words. Damaging a relationship over a dress.", "That the universe revolves around SIL and of COURSE her wedding 25 years ago was the most important event of everyone's lives EVER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I DO have the skirt I wore to my brother's second wedding 20 years ago, but this is a basic black skirt that's seen a LOT of outings since.  A lavender bridesmaids dress does not strike me as having the same rewearability.", "No it would not. I can\u2019t wear clothes from when I was 16 and I\u2019m only 26. Bodies change from teens to adults. I can\u2019t imagine what the SIL is thinking", "They said they can't come but my guess is they probably don't want to.", "I literally still wear one of my prom dresses. I'm 47. Fits better now that I have a touch more hip, but that was my only body change after high school, around age 26. I have bigger shoulders from working out, but most of my dresses have spaghetti straps or are strapless, so no fit issues there. Every body is different, including how we change with age. \n\nDoesn't matter, still a ridiculous ask to have a dress no one asked you to hang onto 25 years later. Especially with multiple moves! Every move is a good purge, usually.", "My thought, too. And even if the other bridesmaids were in their 20s, it is not shameful if they haven't retained their figures, especially if they've had kids. Really a ridiculous notion. Many women don't keep their own wedding dresses that long...", "That was my immediate thought, too!", "Yeah I\u2019m thinking of my sisters wedding when I was literally the skinniest I\u2019ve ever been and that was forty lbs ago. The zipper wouldn\u2019t zip. Lol.", "Yeah but she wasn't 16", "Maybe that\u2019s why they \u201ccan\u2019t go\u201d because they are too afraid to tell this delusional woman that people don\u2019t keep dresses that have no use for 25 years!", "I have a lilac one I have worn plenty, but it's just a very pretty dress and super flattering and the napkin hem works for a range of events, my sis was determined I would wear something I adored. Most bridesmaid dresses are not so much, especially 25 years ago. That was just before bridesmaid dress selection vastly improved. As a several times bridesmaid before and after the switch, it was a real sea change! \n\nSIL has a screw loose if she thinks most bridesmaid dresses aren't immediately donated, though.", "My parents gave me back my year 12 ball gown last year, that I wore at 17, it was custom fit\n\nI held it up to my partner with the line \"I told you I was anorexic skinny as a teen\" \n\nI've been bridesmaid 4 times, the only dress I still have is a gorgeous one from 8 years ago where I was the only bridesmaid and had one that I would like to wear again.\n\nOP is NTA.", "I'm guessing they also didn't want to wear a dress that's 25 years old or SIL also flipped out when they told her they also didn't have the dress.", "It\u2019s insane to expect someone to fit into a dress from 20 years ago. Idk what SIL is thinking.\nHell, even doing something like cardio boxing can broaden out your shoulders to the point that stuff won\u2019t fit even if you stay the same weight", "Maybe they couldnt even if tgey tried. I can't even fit into dresses I wore two years ago.", "I'm wondering how long SIL has been dieting to fit her wedding dress again", "Can clothes kept in normal conditions like just hung in a closet in a garment bag last 25 years? I have some clothes that are around 20 years but it's obvious it should have been donated or thrown away years ago.", "Eh, depending on how old she was when she got married it might not have been as hard for her to get into the dress again since she wasn\u2019t a teenager. But probably at least 6-9 months if she was doing it safely", "I definitely have some really old garments that are still in good condition, but sadly I have no chance in hell of fitting into them. I know I should rehome them but I'm in denial.", "I still wear my own clothing from high school (early 90s) personally. I also wear a lot of vintage garments from well before my lifetime, my prize is a 1920s silk embroidered jacket, I am the 3rd generation to wear it in my family. \n\nThe key factor is the garment bag. If it's regular plastic, that's not good, you want something acid free. If it is a proper storage garment bag, the dress should be in perfectly fine shape, but you might want to pull it out and inspect for insects, let it air out a little. Good luck!", "Sceptical me thinks that she has been dieting and getting in shape with the hope that everyone else looks fat by comparison so she can brag"]}
