That\u2019s ridiculous.

I\u2019m always happy for the married couple, but ultimately it\u2019s their day, not mine, and the dress is just another dress to me (and usually not one I like lol). \n\nYour SIL is unreasonable for expecting you to keep a dress for a quarter century that was worn once when you were 16. If she was that worried about it, she should have asked for all of the bridesmaids to give them to her for safekeeping, and let them collect dust in her own home. It\u2019s also outrageous to expect that after 25 years, people would still fit into those dresses. I know I have clothes from a few months ago that don\u2019t fit me, I can\u2019t imagine having stuff for 25 years ago. \n\nDoes your SIL keep the bridesmaids dresses from every wedding she was in?

And it seems that if you're there you have to be dressed in the same outfit but not the case if you're not, no matter the reason.

Ridiculous.  Clearly there are other issues in this relationship if they are being this insane over a dress, that you own, and have every right to do with what you want.", "NTA. It\u2019s a totally normal thing to get rid of a dress you didn\u2019t pick out and will never wear again. \n\npeople are sooooo weird about their weddings, it\u2019s so creepy, ugh.", "NTA. This is completely ridiculous. It\u2019s been 25 years for goodness sake!", ">She was incredibly hurt that I would discard \"such an important memory\". My brother then disinvited me entirely saying that I had no right to get rid of the dress because my mom bought it so \"it wasn't really yours\" and that they (my brother and SIL) should have been notified and given first dibs when I decided to donate it years ago because it was such an important part of their memory of that day\n\nWell Yikes!! \n\nWho knew 25 year old satin/taffeta puffy sleeve with ruffles dresses held such sentimental value. So much so they didn't even ask to have it so that THEY could keep it. They just expected you to raise, feed, nurture and drag it around every single place and time you moved for the past 25 yrs -  unable to be destroyed or donated. \n\nThey are both being ridiculous. NTA", "NTA. They seem a bit insane to think that EVERYONE cherishes their wedding day like they do. \n\nAs someone has already stated, you were a TEENAGER then. You are 25 years older, as THEY ARE!\n\nLordy!", "NTA. Who deludes themselves that their wedding is an important memory to anyone but them?", "You didn\u2019t have it mounted on acid free matboard, put into a shadow box frame, and protected with UV glass while it hung in your foyer to greet your guests?\n\nFor shame.

I get that their wedding was special to them, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone around them has to cling to every physical moments of the day until the end of time. NTA at all.

I couldn't wear a dress from 25 years ago - and I was an adult then, not a teen.  I mean, I suppose I could technically wear such a thing, but it wouldn't be zipped up at all.  Maybe everyone is going to show up like that - pants unzipped, buttons popped off, the sound of fabric ripping as they start to dance.", "How in the hell could anyone fit into a dress they wore when they were 16, 25 years later??", "NTA. If the dress the bridesmaids wore were going to have somuch sentimental value for her, she should've asked for them after the wedding.\n\nI have one friend who has been in a TON of weddings, and from what I understand, she has only kept 3 former bridesmaid dresses. And that's only because they were of a style where she could (and has) wear them again for formal events.\nI dont even have my wedding dress anymore. I sold it online after about 6 months because it was taking up space in my closet and I thought it eould be good for someone else to get some use out of it.", "What the. You are NTA. 25 years is a loooooong time to hold onto a bridesmaid dress, even if you haven't moved. She's a bit bonkers imo, especially since she uninvited you because of it. Wild.", "NTA.

People don\u2019t keep clothes for that long\u2026 I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid 7 times and have 2 of those dresses still - both because I actually like them and hope I get to wear them again.

I feel like you\u2019re getting punished for ruining an instagram moment or something - I hope your brother sees sense soon.", "NTA. You were a teenager, would the dress still fit? If this was something they wanted to do in future, they should have told your mom and asked for the dress. You were a teenager. What would your mother have done with a dress bought to fit you?\n\nHer wedding was important to her, she cannot expect it to be a core memory for anyone else other than your brother. The fact you were the \"only bridesmaid\" that could come speaks volumes. Seems the others found excuses to stay out of this mess of an anniversary party.

I would be really surprised if either of them still have them.", "THIS. I can't imagine that many of the guests still have that outfit from f***ing 25 years ago!

I can imagine SIL ranting about how she was betrayed by the 4 of them at the party.", ">Also also -- it's been 25 years, and you were a TEENAGER.  Would the dress even still fit?\n\nNo, no it wouldn't. Even if OP happens not to have given birth, a middelaged body is nowhere close to a 16 year old body. Hell, I am 28, *only* 3 kilos heavier than I was at 16, have not had kids, but my body shape has changed drastically. Even if I'd lose that extra 3 kilos, I'd still not fit into my high school clothes. This girl's got hips now, and my boobs have definitely grown since and that's not the extra weight doing it.

But I was a baby then and my mom kept it since it was made by her mother. \ud83d\ude02 OPs brother and wife are delusional thinking she should\u2019ve kept a dress from when she was 16.

She likes to take it every so often and go on about how small I was.\n\nI can use that to segway into how small my brother was.

Fucking grim - I threw them out.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m not really sure what the etiquette is with bridesmaids dresses. I have a bunch in my cupboard I need to get rid of but now I\u2019m thinking I might check in with the brides first haha. I also have the wedding dress my friend had for her first wedding which ended horribly. She\u2019s remarried and I have no idea how to bring up the dress and what to do with it.\n\nI also suggest that OP may need to consult a doctor if she\u2019s the same size she was at 16!

I'll probably donate it soon, just haven't gotten around to it yet.", "Yeah being disinvited is very much a don't you threaten me with a good time sort of reprieve from my pov. You just know the sil is going to be wearing her old dress or something, the difference being she had probably finished puberty completely when she got married.

I tried to wear it last year to a friend's wedding only to discover my hips grew way more on the last 10 years than I would have thought.

You can't easily take back harsh words.

Every move is a good purge, usually.", "My thought, too.

Good lord, what a ridiculous thing to be so upset about!  I'd say you're lucky to be missing the shit show this party will probably be.", "SIL and brother are a trip!

There is no way in hell something from 25 years ago would still fit me.  What a laugh.  Hell, something from 5 years ago doesn't fit. lol", "Now I'm wondering if they had a flower girl and if she also was disinvited for not holding onto a dress from 25 years ago.", "I was a bridesmaid at the same time and similar age and while my mother does still have the dress, I can tell you with absolute certainty that no, it would not fit. Not even remotely.", "Not only that she was 16 and currently is in her 40\u2019s. I would not fit into a dress I wore 25 years ago as a teenager.

The hosts wore their wedding clothes (from 5 years before). I wore a bridesmaid dress from my sister's wedding with full zombie makeup; husband went as the caterer from hell.\n\nCreepy but hella fun.", "From OP's post it sounds like the other bridesmaids aren't able to make it an OP was the only one - I have a feeling this party isn't going how SIL intended and she's running into a lot of issues and that's why she's angry. Doesn't make her justified in the slightest and it was u fair to take it out on OP, especially thinking they had dibs on a dress that wasn't theirs. OP is NTA at all.", "I know!!! I at first read it as OP is currently 25 and thought it was their 10 year but at 25 years I would be impressed if they fit into their outfits from the wedding! These people have had families! Their bodies have aged! I mean...OP was still a teenager! And the expectation of keeping it that long?! If my Mom and stepdad wanted to do this there'd be no way because though I haven't gotten taller since 11 (yay for being short!)

OMG I'd have to pin it to the front of something else there's no way it would fit me.\n\nThey're delusional", "I wonder what would SIL say if OP still had the dress but was not able to fit into it anymore.\n\nI bet she'd throw a fit...", "It would surprise me if she could. I am 19 now and didn't even fit in my confirmation dress which I wore when I was fourteen, because my body's proportions changed. And I'm pretty sure that I won't fit in my prom in ten years.", "I have a confession to make.  I own t-shirts that are over 25 years old.  One is from 1982 and was given to me by my dad.  One is the first t-shirt I bought when I went to that same college.  It doesn't get worn very often as it is fragile.  I still own my AP Calculus and my AP English t-shirts from 1997.  I fit into all of them because they are t-shirts and I liked them baggy when I was in high school and college.\n\nIt is times like this that I realize that I'm very slowly turning into my father and I'm not proud of it.  That said, I've gotten rid of every bridesmaid dress that I've ever owned so OP is NTA.", "We had a \u201cHawaiian\u201d themed wedding in NYS. We had specific outfits for each person. \n\nThe bridesmaids all had an identical floral sundress WE bought them for $40. The groomsmen had identical shirts. The Dads had matching shirts to each other. The 3 moms had matching shirts. I had a $100 prom dress that looked like a wedding dress. Hubby had his own individual Hawaiian shirt. \n\nAt our 20 year anniversary dinner, we told everybody to wear Hawaiian again. We certainly did not expect them to have the same shirts and dresses from 20 years before.", "I agree completely. I have a dress that I wore to a wedding in 2001 or 2002, but I couldn't throw it away because it is associated with so many memories (it is a beautiful colour and design, my ex's mother bought it for me because she treated me like a daughter she didn't have etc.). I also have worn it a lot, so it got torn and I was considering turning it into a skirt. LOL", "Some people do choose to have their wedding dresses preserved since they usually cost an arm, a leg, and a kidney.  This is the first time I have ever heard of someone wanting their bridesmaids to save their dresses.\n\nGranted one of my cousin's did save all of the bridesmaid dresses she has worn over the years, but that was with the intention of offering them to her daughters for school formals since they were in very classic styles, or even just reusing the fabric for that purpose.", "The whole thing is wild, but that was the partt that made decide they were crazy and not worth stressing over.  Of *course* her mother bought it for there, she was 16. Also, when someone buys you something, that thing is yours now. That's why is widely considered an asshole move to ask for gifts back later on. Brother and SIL are irrational and not worth stressing over.", "I think you are seeing why the other 3 bridesmaids have peaced out, either of the party or the SIL\u2019s life.", "You keep clothes for 25 years? Even more clothes you\u2019ve only worn 1 time? She was 16 I think her body has gone through a change. \nWhy would her brother or sil have any claim on it. It is op\u2019s if they wanted it maybe they should have said hey can we have that after this.

Fast fashion has had an incredibly deleterious impact on how society views their wardrobe and we\u2019ve generally lost the skills necessary to take good care of our belongings. When I started college 20 years ago, I was the only girl in my sorority who could darn socks, adjust hems, use crocheting to fix holes in sweaters, scarves and hats, etc.  I was also taught to be conscientious about assembling my wardrobe - limiting overly trendy items and refusing to adopt any style that were not flattering and comfortable.

I\u2019ve certainly worn it plenty, but I want to keep wearing it forever!

Vintage silk is incredible, isn't it? So strong but so soft, all broken in. \n\nThey make soooo many cedar products now, I rent so I lined the floor of my closet with loose planks and got cedar hangers for some wool coats and suits and little hanging blocks for between items. I made a makeshift cheap cedar bin for sweaters with an acid-free plastic bin with lots of cedar balls, too. I think it cost about $20?
