That\u2019s ridiculous.

I\u2019m always happy for the married couple, but ultimately it\u2019s their day, not mine, and the dress is just another dress to me (and usually not one I like lol). \n\nYour SIL is unreasonable for expecting you to keep a dress for a quarter century that was worn once when you were 16. If she was that worried about it, she should have asked for all of the bridesmaids to give them to her for safekeeping, and let them collect dust in her own home. It\u2019s also outrageous to expect that after 25 years, people would still fit into those dresses. I know I have clothes from a few months ago that don\u2019t fit me, I can\u2019t imagine having stuff for 25 years ago. \n\nDoes your SIL keep the bridesmaids dresses from every wedding she was in?

And it seems that if you're there you have to be dressed in the same outfit but not the case if you're not, no matter the reason.

Ridiculous.  Clearly there are other issues in this relationship if they are being this insane over a dress, that you own, and have every right to do with what you want.", "NTA. It\u2019s a totally normal thing to get rid of a dress you didn\u2019t pick out and will never wear again. \n\npeople are sooooo weird about their weddings, it\u2019s so creepy, ugh.", "NTA. This is completely ridiculous. It\u2019s been 25 years for goodness sake!", ">She was incredibly hurt that I would discard \"such an important memory\". My brother then disinvited me entirely saying that I had no right to get rid of the dress because my mom bought it so \"it wasn't really yours\" and that they (my brother and SIL) should have been notified and given first dibs when I decided to donate it years ago because it was such an important part of their memory of that day\n\nWell Yikes!! \n\nWho knew 25 year old satin/taffeta puffy sleeve with ruffles dresses held such sentimental value. So much so they didn't even ask to have it so that THEY could keep it. They just expected you to raise, feed, nurture and drag it around every single place and time you moved for the past 25 yrs -  unable to be destroyed or donated. \n\nThey are both being ridiculous. NTA", "NTA. They seem a bit insane to think that EVERYONE cherishes their wedding day like they do. \n\nAs someone has already stated, you were a TEENAGER then. You are 25 years older, as THEY ARE!\n\nLordy!", "NTA. Who deludes themselves that their wedding is an important memory to anyone but them?", "You didn\u2019t have it mounted on acid free matboard, put into a shadow box frame, and protected with UV glass while it hung in your foyer to greet your guests?\n\nFor shame.

I get that their wedding was special to them, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone around them has to cling to every physical moments of the day until the end of time. NTA at all.

I couldn't wear a dress from 25 years ago - and I was an adult then, not a teen.  I mean, I suppose I could technically wear such a thing, but it wouldn't be zipped up at all.  Maybe everyone is going to show up like that - pants unzipped, buttons popped off, the sound of fabric ripping as they start to dance.", "How in the hell could anyone fit into a dress they wore when they were 16, 25 years later??", "NTA. If the dress the bridesmaids wore were going to have somuch sentimental value for her, she should've asked for them after the wedding.\n\nI have one friend who has been in a TON of weddings, and from what I understand, she has only kept 3 former bridesmaid dresses. And that's only because they were of a style where she could (and has) wear them again for formal events.\nI dont even have my wedding dress anymore. I sold it online after about 6 months because it was taking up space in my closet and I thought it eould be good for someone else to get some use out of it.", "What the. You are NTA. 25 years is a loooooong time to hold onto a bridesmaid dress, even if you haven't moved. She's a bit bonkers imo, especially since she uninvited you because of it. Wild.", "NTA.

People don\u2019t keep clothes for that long\u2026 I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid 7 times and have 2 of those dresses still - both because I actually like them and hope I get to wear them again.

I feel like you\u2019re getting punished for ruining an instagram moment or something - I hope your brother sees sense soon.", "NTA. You were a teenager, would the dress still fit? If this was something they wanted to do in future, they should have told your mom and asked for the dress. You were a teenager. What would your mother have done with a dress bought to fit you?\n\nHer wedding was important to her, she cannot expect it to be a core memory for anyone else other than your brother. The fact you were the \"only bridesmaid\" that could come speaks volumes. Seems the others found excuses to stay out of this mess of an anniversary party.

I would be really surprised if either of them still have them.", "THIS. I can't imagine that many of the guests still have that outfit from f***ing 25 years ago!

I can imagine SIL ranting about how she was betrayed by the 4 of them at the party.", ">Also also -- it's been 25 years, and you were a TEENAGER.  Would the dress even still fit?\n\nNo, no it wouldn't. Even if OP happens not to have given birth, a middelaged body is nowhere close to a 16 year old body. Hell, I am 28, *only* 3 kilos heavier than I was at 16, have not had kids, but my body shape has changed drastically. Even if I'd lose that extra 3 kilos, I'd still not fit into my high school clothes. This girl's got hips now, and my boobs have definitely grown since and that's not the extra weight doing it.

But I was a baby then and my mom kept it since it was made by her mother. \ud83d\ude02 OPs brother and wife are delusional thinking she should\u2019ve kept a dress from when she was 16.

She likes to take it every so often and go on about how small I was.\n\nI can use that to segway into how small my brother was.

Fucking grim - I threw them out.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m not really sure what the etiquette is with bridesmaids dresses. I have a bunch in my cupboard I need to get rid of but now I\u2019m thinking I might check in with the brides first haha. I also have the wedding dress my friend had for her first wedding which ended horribly. She\u2019s remarried and I have no idea how to bring up the dress and what to do with it.\n\nI also suggest that OP may need to consult a doctor if she\u2019s the same size she was at 16!

I'll probably donate it soon, just haven't gotten around to it yet.", "Yeah being disinvited is very much a don't you threaten me with a good time sort of reprieve from my pov. You just know the sil is going to be wearing her old dress or something, the difference being she had probably finished puberty completely when she got married.

I tried to wear it last year to a friend's wedding only to discover my hips grew way more on the last 10 years than I would have thought.

You can't easily take back harsh words.

Every move is a good purge, usually.", "My thought, too.

I mean, didn't SIL pick it just because you could wear it to soooo many other occasions?! \nNTA! Go online, find a similar dress and color. Then go out with partner and friends to a fancy dinner. Be sure to post it everywhere!", "OMG. NTA. If it wasn\u2019t 2am I might be laughing out loud at how ridiculous they sound.", "What a weird thing to freak out over.  NTA, this is absurd.", "NTA who the hell expects you to keep a dress fir 25 years (unless it was a wedding dress). Did she ask you 25 years ago to keep the dress until their 25th anniversary? She and your brother are definitely the AH's here", "NTA - 25 YEARS?  It's been 25 years since that wedding . . . Why oh why would you hang on to that bridesmaid's dress!  Most people I know want to get rid of them as soon as possible . . LOL.  She wants to play bridzilla I guess but you were certainly under no obligation to keep it. If anyone, other than yourself, thought that dress was of such high value it should be saved for all eternity then THEY should have been the ones to save it . . . be buried in it for all that matters.  I wouldn't WANT to go to that weird celebration because of their bizarre response to you living your life in a normal way and not hanging on to this dress forever.", "NTA - because who the F holds on to a *bridesmaid's dress* for 25 years!!!???!!!!\n\nI get keeping a wedding gown, but a bridesmaid's dress? No way. \n\nI was a bridesmaid in two weddings. The first was my sis' and she had pretty silver/lilac dresses with a little jacket. While I never wore the jacket part agaion, I did shorten the dress itself and wear it to a couple of holiday parties over the next 2-3 years. Then, I donated it for someone else to enjoy. The second was my bestie's and, while I love her dearly, she picked put the ugliest, most unflattering bridesmaid dress I ever saw. But, I wore it with a big smile on the day of her wedding. Then, when I returned home the following day, it went right in the Goodwill bin. Buh-bye!", "Oh ok so with that logic all their wedding gifts aren\u2019t theirs, either. \n\nShe took her anger out on you because no other bridesmaid could make it. \n\nThis couple lives in la-la land. No one expects anyone to save a bridesmaid dress, especially a teenager. They think just because the bride saves her dress, everyone else has to. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, they didn\u2019t want you there at all and used this to uninvite you is what I would think", "Holy cow. You are 100% NTA. I wouldn\u2019t keep a dress for 25 years and I certainly wouldn\u2019t fit a dress from 25 years ago.", "Oh, good lord, I've heard some ridiculous demands, but this one takes the cake.  Somehow, they expected you to intuitively know that they planned to do this on their 25th anniversary?  I am betting none of the other bridesmaids kept their dresses either.  To expect you to keep this dress like it was the Shroud of Turin is incredulous. Plus, since you were only 16 when you wore it, the odds are it wouldn't still fit. NTA, but they are! (If she is so into it, tell her to have a seamstress replicate the dress.)", "NTA its crazy to think u would still have it.", "NTA. Since they are going with the idea that since your mother paid for the dress it didn't belong to you, that goes both ways. They didn't pay for it either.", "NTA, but send them a nice floral arrangement to thank them for uninviting you.\n\n       \nSeriously, if the success of their 25th anniversary is dependent on dresses that belong to other people, there is no hope for them.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are freaking insane.  Like, completely.", "WTF???!!!", "NTA. I have exactly 0 of the 5 bridesmaid dresses I wore from over a decade ago. I re-wore one of them to a wedding I wasn\u2019t in (had it altered to be appropriate) and the rest collected dust as I either didn\u2019t fit in them anymore or they were just not wearable for other events. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s just clothing. If your SIL wanted it kept she should have thought of it 25 years ago. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA\n\nMy roommate and I were in the same wedding. Immediately after the wedding my roommate put the dress straight in the trash. No one should be expected to keep a bridesmaid dress", "I had to re read the 25th anniversary sentence like 4 times\u2026 because my brain was wondering how tf someone would expect someone to fit into a dress they wore at 16", "I (62) am the same weight I was in HS, but the body is nowhere near the same.  I couldn\u2019t possibly wear anything from then.  (Couldn\u2019t even if it was only 25 years!)

SIL and Brother are off their rocker if they think any of the bridesmaids have their dresses.\n\nAgreed, they could have stored the entire bridal party's dresses, shoes accessories, etc. Hell just set up a replica wedding in their basement, don't even get rid of the food. SIL can live in her wedding dress for the rest of her life..... (I really hope someone gets this reference)\n\nAlso are they going to get offended that the groomsmen returned their rental suits? \n\nI know bridesmaids who have BURNED their dresses, so your SIL and Brother should be grateful you only donated your dress OP.", "I suspect that might be the reason the other bridesmaids aren't coming. Of course they don't have their dress from 25 years ago.", "The bride asked if she could keep the dress I wore as a bridesmaid. I handed it right over. I don't remember now because it was 25 or more years ago but I believe she paid for them.  There were several bridesmaids, I'm not sure why she asked just me but I was happy to give it to her and would not have kept it. NTA, your brother and SIL are nuts!", "I still have the dress I wore for my SIL\u2019s wedding, but I cut it up about 20 years ago for a Halloween costume. She wouldn\u2019t want me to wear it now.", "I think I\u2019m at least 30-40 pounds heavier than I was at 16.  I do have a pair of sweatpants I can still wear, nothing else. Aside from it being 25 years ago, she was a child. These people do not live in the same reality as the rest of us.", "I'm guessing that the SIL was thinking of wearing her wedding dress at the party and wanted the bridesmaids to wear their dresses so she wouldn't look insane.", "This is a pretty well-known power play these days. It's the bride saying 'I can still fit into my dress, what do you mean you can't?!' People like that are exhausting drama queens. NTA", "Are the bride and groom wearing their wedding duds? I'd be surprised to see if they still fit in those without alterations.", "At my grandparents 50th, my cousin showcased my grandmas wedding dress, for some photos and I think one of her bridesmaids still had her dress and I wore that  for some photos. But they got married in a totally different era!", "They were thinking SIL has way more notice than the others will diet like hell to be the ONLY one still skinny enough for HER dress and everyone will be in awe that she is as lovely as the day he married her \ud83d\ude44", "I gave one to the neighbour's  girls for dress up", "I think we know why the other bridesmaids aren't coming..", "Right?? I kept my bat mitzvah dress and my senior prom dress ONLY because my grandmother (RIP) made them and I\u2019ll never be able to let go of them emotionally.

They are so versatile. You're totally going to be able to wear them again. \n\nBridesmaid: \ud83d\ude2c Oh yeah, I will totally be able to wear that dress again. \n\nNarrator: The Bridesmaid, never did ever have a chance to wear the dress ever again", "Ding ding ding! SIL's demanding and self-centered behavior probably alienated them years ago.", ">my guess is they probably don't want to.\n\nBecause the SIL and brother are clearly nuts!", "Have you?", "So it should work perfectly for Halloween!", "Before donating my wedding dress, I barely got my arms in the sleeves and couldn't zip the back. It was too small for my 15 year old. It fit my 11  year old. We all took funny pictures and sent the dress off.", ">pastel yellow makes me look nauseated. Lol\n\nYellow and orange make me look like I need a ride to the hospital.  Any other colour I can wear regardless of shade.  But I can't even stand next to someone wearing yellow or orange without looking like I'm violently ill.", "Lol your sister in law and brother are not the brightest bulbs on the tree. Save your money and go on a vacation rather than their stupid little party. NTA", "NTA by any stretch of the imagination. Your brother and SIL are nutcases if they think that dress meant anything much to you, it wasn't your wedding and you were a teenager.   \n\n\nEven if somehow it had still fit, no, you shouldn't have to hold on to every bridesmaid dress ever just in case some bride decides in the future that she'll make an insane request that you wear it again for her.

Sorry you had to deal with their crazy!!!", "NTA Your brother & SIL are nutty-coo-coo.", "OMFG You know what, I bet you if you were to ask them 20 years ago what they wanted to do with the dress they would have probably been like why the hell are you asking me? Now all the sudden they want you to wear a 25-year-old dress? Would it even fit? This is only a problem cuz they have some messed up vision in their head about this party, everybody gets rid of bridal party dresses! Most of the time they're ugly anyway! And no matter what a bride says, you'll never have anything to wear it to again! NTA but they're kind of unhinged for expecting you to hold on to a dress for 25 years just in case they want you to wear it at some point in the future lol", "NTA. This really underlines my feeling that a surprising number of people are absolutely batshit regarding anything to do with their wedding. This is absolutely deluded and self centered beyond belief.", "NTA, what a ridiculous idea you should hang on to a dress for 25 years as a souvenir from someone else's wedding.\n\nHow many of those bridesmaids still fit into their dresses????\n\nYou're literally the only member of the wedding party who bothered to say they could come to the party anyway. So those other 3 who claim they still have the dresses? Let's see some evidence.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL are nuts.\n\nThey really expect a 41yo woman to a) still have, and b) fit into, a 16yo's dress from 25 years ago?", "This is the dumbest thing I have heard in a while. NTA and be happy you are not going!", "NTA I\u2019ve had three different bridesmaids dresses and haven\u2019t kept any of them since they take up so much room. I think normal brides don\u2019t care about them past the wedding date, none of them have cared that the dresses weren\u2019t kept and one even helped another bridesmaid sell hers.", "NTA. This is one of those ideas that is an errant thought crossing through one\u2019s mind that should be completely shut down once the thinker realises it\u2019s ridiculous. \nI\u2019ve been a bridesmaid twice and neither of those people would expect me to have held on to my dress. \nFurther, as for the non-wedding party guests, as if they still own their out of style clothes from 25 years ago, or would still fit them if they did, or even remember what they wore!! Smart phones and social media  weren\u2019t around back then, unless it was particularly special eg an immediate family member, who\u2019s even going to have photos of themselves at a wedding they attended 25 years ago?? Someone in this story is T A but it\u2019s not OP", "NTA\n\nYou are the only one who can even go to the party in the first place leads me to believe that at least one of the others doesn't have their dress either and just feels really guilty.

I can\u2019t believe that a vintage dress is more important to them than having you attend is. Weird priorities.", "NTA. I couldn\u2019t even begin to tell you what I did with either of the bridesmaid dresses I wore. No clue. Hell, I don\u2019t even have my wedding dress - I gave it away to a friend of a friend. No idea if she actually wore it, and don\u2019t care. Everyone is different about the sentimentality attached to things vs. memories, so if it was that important to her, she should have communicated it to you - it is most certainly not the norm for bridesmaids to hold on to their dresses for 25 years.", "They really expected people to keep bridesmaids outfits from 25 years ago?\n\nHow many people even still fit in them?\n\nNTA", "first of all, how are you expected to fit into a dress you wore when you were sixteen NTA", "Oh for crissake...how many people out of a thousand still have the outfit they wore at an event 25 years ago... AND can still fit in it???\n\nI'd guess about six, but that might be high.\n\nThis is one of the dumber party themes I've ever heard.\n\nThere is zero reason for a teenage girl to keep a fricken bridesmaid dress for 25 weeks, much less 25 years. There is even less reason for anybody to get upset about it. It's not exactly an heirloom.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  The only dress a person keeps for 25 years is a wedding dress.", "NTA   is very rare for a bridesmaid to keep her bridesmaid dress forever.\n\nNot everyone will be able to still fit into their dress/clothes 25 years later. Especially if you were in high school at the time. \n\nIf not stores properly could possibly be ruined.\n\nAlthough your mom paid for the bridesmaid dress, it was a gift to you.  Otherwise your mom would have asked for the dress to be returned to her.  This was definitely your dress,  no one's else's.\n\nNo one reaches out to the bride (at any point) to ask for permission to donate their bridesmaid dress they own or ask if bride would like it keep for themselves as a momento.  I've been in weddings, my friends have been in weddings - this is not a thing and very unreasonable demand.  \n\nThen you're brother and SIL want to reenact their wedding/reception 25 years later. This is what is weird. A 25th anniversary normal. Reenacting is it not. \n\nAnd obviously this in not a cultural thing otherwise you would have held onto the bridesmaid dress and all guests would have held onto their wedding party outfits. We know they didn't and probably don't even remember what they wore that day. \n\nBrother and SIL are spazzing out already and the invites just went out.  Wait until the responses come in or people start arriving in something other than what they wore 25 years ago. \n\nYou lucked out by being uninvited.

Like I've been married almost 17 years and I would bet a million dollars none of my bridesmaids still have the dress or that it would even fit any of them anymore. Hell my own wedding dress is too small for me now. 2 kids and a plethora of health issues will do that.", "NTA\n\nIf I kept ever bridesmaids dress I would have a closet full of tacky dresses that would never see the light of day. They are being unreasonable to expect you to hold onto a dress forever that lets be real, didn't have the same meaning to you as it clearly did to them.  They need to calm down and get over it. It's not that big a deal. Hardly anyone keeps bridesmaid dress for years let alone decades.", "I was HORRIFIED by the teeth box. I don\u2019t like teeth generally. I was in a dark attic and the box had no marking on to suggest it was HUMAN BODY PARTS. But it rattled so I thought it might be jewellery.
