You do realize she could file actual charges against YOU if you sign it(if she's not there--she can pretty easily prove she wasn't there to SIGN CHECK).  \n\nIf anything, you should be contacting your sister and WARNING her.

So I had to be very picky about which branch I went to, to get access to my money when I got paid. And these checks were under $1k. \n\nMy  bank also automatically puts a hold on checks deposited by ATM, so if I wanted access to the money right away, I had to go talk to a teller. \n\nIf this bank is any good, they should be putting a hold on most  if not all of that money, regardless if the signature matches.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. It could be a loan check rather than a scholarship.", "The bank would likely reject the deposit and open a fraud investigation. Most deposits would require the recipient of the check to be named on the bank account. Because lots of people use the ATM to commit deposit fraud, a check for $11,000 would likely have a hold on the funds for at least a few business days if it was actually deposited.\n\nMany times a check \u201csigned over\u201d to someone else may require both parties to be present and go inside the bank to show identification. Even then, if the bank decided to accept it, they would not cash it. It would be deposited with a hold on the funds."]}
