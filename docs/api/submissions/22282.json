Your mother wants you to commit a crime. Don\u2019t do it and put the check somewhere where she can\u2019t find it.", "NTA and tell your sister. If the funds are used for non school things, she may need to pay it back. With interest. Help her nip this in the bud now.", "NTA.  What your mom is asking of you is illegal and could get you/her into a lot of trouble.  Morally and legally you made the right decision to refuse to sign that check.  It belongs to your sister, not your mother, and your sister could sue your mother if she steals that money, plus charges can be brought against your mother for forgery.  This is not a minor thing.  Shame on your mother for wanting to steal from her daughter.", "NTA please don\u2019t sign it. This is your sister\u2019s money for school. Your mom is not entitled to it and while it is unfortunate she can\u2019t cover bills, it would be very wrong to steal this money.", "NTA\n\nYou are right in this situation for not signing the check. It may seem like a \"small\" thing to do, but (where I live) it can result in jail time and a large amount in fines that would not be worth it to even try. Good for you.", "NTA, do NOT kite a check, if it\u2019s a real check that\u2019s a crime, and if this is some kind of scam (which tbh seems likely) you\u2019ll be getting yourself AND your sister mixed up in it. (Sometimes a \u201ccheck\u201d like this is actually a scam designed to trick ppl into taking out what is really a private loan w/really bad interest rates)\n\nEdit: if your mom already did this, pls tell your sister, I know that may be hard or not safe if you\u2019re still at home, but tell her, if you can", "You need to tell your sister. Take the check from your mom and send it to your sister so she can use it for the right things. She will find out and there will be problems.\n\nFor some of the scholarships I won there were only certain ways I had to spend the money so you could get in a lot of trouble and be forced to pay it back. Like I had to provide receipts that I spent it on the things that were allowed. Your sister could get in big trouble and so could you and your mom.\n\nDon\u2019t risk it.\n\nNTA but your mom is.", "NTA. What is your mother thinking?? It\u2019s illegal!\n\nPlease tell your sister and tell your sister what your mother is planning to do with the cheque!", "It is a serious crime to forge someone's signature. You were right for not doing it, but you definitely need to let your sister know what's going on. That is not okay on your moms part.", "NTA that's straight up stealing, illegal and despicable. Also tell your sister about her scholarship or if you can get a hold of the check send your sister a front and back picture so she can digitally deposit it. Hopefully your mom hasn't yet.", "NTA. You sign it and you\u2019ll be the one in prison. Call your sister immediately and tell her about the check.", "What did your sister say???", "NTA Your mother wants you to commit a crime and steal from your sister. Tell your sister about the cheque immediately and put the cheque away somewhere safe", "NTA.   \nTell your sister, now.\n\nIf your mother does this, she will probably end up paying more in fines, or spending time in jail.", "INFO: how is your mom able to cash the check even if she forges your sister's signature? Isn't the check made out to your sister and can only be deposited in her bank account? It would be insane if a scholarship sent out checks made out to cash or simply blank.", "NTA\n\nYou do realize that forging that signature would be fraud/forgery?????  You use the word Forge but seem to attach no criminal liability to it.\n\nWhat happens when your sister finds out?  Do you think she'll just say, oh good you spent my scholarship--that's so cool.  It's your sister's scholarship, her money.  You do realize she could file actual charges against YOU if you sign it(if she's not there--she can pretty easily prove she wasn't there to SIGN CHECK).  \n\nIf anything, you should be contacting your sister and WARNING her.  The loss of those funds could wreck her education.  \n\noh good checked comments--you contacted your sister-YEAH!!!!\n\nBut next time never doubt yourself for refusing to commit a crime!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They would first check your moms ID, if she goes to the bank herself, and see if it matches the name on the check, if it doesnt it requires additional questions and may result in calling cops and the bank confiscating the cheque.", "Have you told your sister about the cheque?
