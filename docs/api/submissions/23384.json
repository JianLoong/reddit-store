I'd feel awkward having someone I know clean up my messes too", "Nta.  Friendship and business don't mix.  If there were issues could you address them knowing these are people you see socially?  Probably not.", "As they say, good fences make good neighbours. This seems like you'd be taking the proverbial fence down, lol. NTA", "NTA, don\u2019t mix business with family or friends. What if they did a bad job? Broke something?", "Honestly I can see both sides. It\u2019s awesome supporting local small businesses and also trusting the person who is deep cleaning your house. Always support local businesses when you can! \n\nI can also see your view on it being awkward, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d want my neighbor cleaning my house and we mainly just exchange pleasantries when we see each other and have no other relationship. Since it seems like you have a friendship with them I could also potentially see them finding it slightly awkward. \n\nRealistically it probably isn\u2019t going to be awkward if you do it and you would be supporting your friends so maybe talk to them about it. I understand your reasoning and I don\u2019t think it makes you and ass hole for having it, and I do agree with your wife that you should support them with business. NAH", "NAH, though I think you're making the smart decision.  If you don't like the way they clean your house, or if something gets broken or something else happens, suddenly you have a dispute going with the people right next door.", "NAH it's the same concept as having a doctor friend be your primary care physician. There is no wrong answer to whether you choose to hire them or not, it's a question of if you feel comfortable with them seeing all your business like that", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to mix business with friends.  \n\nWhat if they break something? Or do a crappy job?  Suppose you lose something and your first thought is that they stole it?\n\nThen you\u2019ll have bad blood with your neighbor.", "NAH. Your wife wants to support the neighbours business, you want to separate the private and professional nature of the relationship with your cleaner.\n\nHonestly, I'm with you. Not for the image thing, but for if it goes wrong. What if they do something wrong? What if something gets broken or lost? *You have to continue to live near these people*.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
