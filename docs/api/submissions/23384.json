I'd feel awkward having someone I know clean up my messes too", "Nta.  Friendship and business don't mix.  If there were issues could you address them knowing these are people you see socially?  Probably not.", "As they say, good fences make good neighbours. This seems like you'd be taking the proverbial fence down, lol. NTA", "NTA, don\u2019t mix business with family or friends. What if they did a bad job? Broke something?", "Honestly I can see both sides. It\u2019s awesome supporting local small businesses and also trusting the person who is deep cleaning your house. Always support local businesses when you can! \n\nI can also see your view on it being awkward, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d want my neighbor cleaning my house and we mainly just exchange pleasantries when we see each other and have no other relationship. Since it seems like you have a friendship with them I could also potentially see them finding it slightly awkward. \n\nRealistically it probably isn\u2019t going to be awkward if you do it and you would be supporting your friends so maybe talk to them about it. I understand your reasoning and I don\u2019t think it makes you and ass hole for having it, and I do agree with your wife that you should support them with business. NAH", "NAH, though I think you're making the smart decision.  If you don't like the way they clean your house, or if something gets broken or something else happens, suddenly you have a dispute going with the people right next door.", "NAH it's the same concept as having a doctor friend be your primary care physician. There is no wrong answer to whether you choose to hire them or not, it's a question of if you feel comfortable with them seeing all your business like that", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to mix business with friends.  \n\nWhat if they break something? Or do a crappy job?  Suppose you lose something and your first thought is that they stole it?\n\nThen you\u2019ll have bad blood with your neighbor.", "NAH. Your wife wants to support the neighbours business, you want to separate the private and professional nature of the relationship with your cleaner.\n\nHonestly, I'm with you. Not for the image thing, but for if it goes wrong. What if they do something wrong? What if something gets broken or lost? *You have to continue to live near these people*.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But if you want support their cleaning business, hire them for something simpler or recommend them to other people", "i am the same as you.  i don\u2019t want to air out my dirty laundry to my friends neither.  NTA.   BUT you can talk to your neighbor and request that it will be his employee who handles it, do you know what i mean?", "NTA what if they did a bad job? There goes friendship and respect.", "NTA  \n\n\nI needed some work done and my next-door neighbour tried to talk me into hiring her sons. I'm not convinced that they'd do a decent job. Even so, I don't want them knowing all my business.", "It\u2019s one thing to support local but this seems a little too local. Do they own a business with employees? Could they send employees so they aren\u2019t actually doing the cleaning but you are still supporting them? NAH.", "NTA.  You are never the butthole for this.  You are not obligated to patrimonies someone\u2019s business just because you know them personally.  \n\nMy dad\u2019s cousin, a realtor, used to be very good friends with my stepmother, but when my dad and stepmother got divorced, the cousin kept pressuring and pressuring and pressuring my stepmother to a) use her to sell their previous apartment and the b) buy a new place IMMEDIATELY even though my stepmother wasn\u2019t sure about her long term plans.\n\nAnd of course cousin realtor kept pushing the issue after politely and firmly being told to drop it, and now so far as I know, the friendship is over.\n\nMy sister is selling her apartment, and is just dreading what will happen when cousin realtor finds out.  I told her to just say that our mom is the one handling the sale (our mom bought the apartment for her) and she\u2019s either selling it herself or using her own realtor.  But it\u2019s still a fucking pain to have to walk on eggshells around a family member who thinks they\u2019re entitled to your money just because of the industry they work in.", "NTA when I read the title I thought I wouldn\u2019t want my neighbor cleaning my house seeing how dirty it was.", "Nta that would feel so weird. Like they're going to see literally every nook and cranny of your home. I wouldn't be comfortable with that either.", "NTA. This may sound like a weird comparison, but I feel the same way about going to our male GP for a pap. He is a lovely man, whom we have known for years, but he is almost like a friend and I don't want him exploring my \"personal territory\" when I have to see him on a regular basis.\n\nThe person who cleans your home also gets to learn your most intimate secrets. I would feel very uncomfortable having my neighbour know so much about me (even though we don't have any unusual things to hide).\n\nAlso, if they did not do their job the way I want it done, I would likely have a hard time complaining to this person and insisting they do it my way. It would be hard to fire someone you know personally.\n\nBetter to not cross those neighbourly boundaries.", "NAH but I agree fully with you. \n\nLook I love the lady who comes every other week to clean. I have ADHD and knowing a capable adult has deemed my house clean is such a stress off my mind. Especially with kids etc. \n\nI love her. In fact we would probably be friends if we were coworkers or neighbors. \n\nBut she sees my house at its worst. She sees my house when I\u2019m at *my* worst. And the reason we work well together is because she understands- despite always tidying before she comes, sometimes I say my office is off limits, sometimes my bathroom is literally gross, sometimes she finds old granola bars my kid has smuggled to their room, one time she found dirty underwear under my other kid\u2019s bed and I was mortified. \n\nAnd chances are, she does judge, in her head. Never with her actions. And that\u2019s so appreciated. Seriously I have told her the positive impact her work has on my mental health. \n\nBut I could never like, go out for drinks with her and feel totally comfortable. She\u2019s seen my dark and dirty corners literally lol. She may not judge me **but I do**\n\nHaving some boundaries there means our working relationship is protected you know?", "NTA Hire who you want, they are neighbors and it is not a hood idea"]}
