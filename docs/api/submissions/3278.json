Dont bother with them anymore.", "NTA, your family decided you were going to provide for them without your knowledge or consent and also made decisions about where you would sleep that contradicted your wishes. That's awful and they should not have expected that of you, a 19 year old, when there are other adults who need to be pulling their own weight or at least trying to find ways to do so.\nI know finding a job is hard right now and can take a while, but sometimes you can't be too choosy with that kind of thing so you can get off the ground.\nYour family needs to take responsibility for themselves and not put it all on you.", "NTA.\n\nPLEASE don't ever sign anything on anyone's behalf. If the lease is in your name, or you co-sign anything, the debt is actively yours.

Good luck to you and your boyfriend.", "look, I know you don't want to be cruel to your family but what you need to focus on here is that apparently your mom and two siblings all are having trouble getting this place.  That means they all likely have bad credit.  whomever you spoke to about credit knew what they were talking about.    \nyou need to NOT sign anything.  you need to educate yourself about credit and how it can affect your home, job, and finances so you can break this pattern.  I know it can be hard to say No to people you love but you need to.  If you don't, you won't be able to help them later because you will be in the same sinking ship, if you see what I mean? \n\nIt's probably wise to check your credit reports now.  If you have a bank account and need help, ask your bank.  Know what is on it if you don't already.  I've read too many times on this reddit about people using their children's credit without their knowledge.  I'm not saying that's happening here but you need to find out. good luck to you.  you will be NTA.
