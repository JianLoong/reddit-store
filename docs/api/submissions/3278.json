There's no point in even engaging with this because they don't respect you.\n\nSince they don't even feel like they owe you information, and they're not complaining about government housing not working out, it seems like their first thing to try was manipulating you.

Here\u2019s an example of appropriate behavior. \n\nI have marginal credit, and moved states to be near my daughter\u2019s family. She offered to co-sign the lease. I paid all of the moving costs as well as all of the deposits. There is NO WAY I would ever have missed a payment. I also had a job lined up and enough savings to cover the interim. A couple of times the timing of my paycheck was off, and I had to borrow the rent money from them. The very first thing I did was pay them back. This was a risk for them regardless of my financial situation, but they had previously co-signed a car lease, so we had a history there. \n\nThis is how it should work. You should never put yourself in a precarious position financially. That\u2019s what you would be doing here. Continue to look for a new place. However, since you and your boyfriend work together, it would be a stressful situation if you were living together. You may want to look for another job as well.", "Are you sure the landlord kicked them out for the reasons they said? I wouldn't put it past them to try and spin an evicton to put themselves in a positive light, just to try to manipulate you."]}
