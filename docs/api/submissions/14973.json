You can offer to charge her (money up front!) if you want but I have no idea how you would be able to divide the paint up equally. I have a feeling that if you give her the can of paint with the expectation of getting it back with enough paint left over for you to paint your room, that's going to be a big NO. She will probably dump out any leftover paint for revenge and you'll have to buy a can of paint for yourself.
