She was probably unaware I could hear them. She was happy that everything she needs is in the basement (i.e., paint + accessories like paint brushes and so on). The other roommate asked her if that stuff is shared and C\u2019s response was \u201ceh it\u2019s in a shared space so probably\u201d.

The rest of the supplies are still there as I didn\u2019t pay for them. The petty part of the story is that there is most likely enough paint left to cover both her and my room.

You can offer to charge her (money up front!) if you want but I have no idea how you would be able to divide the paint up equally. I have a feeling that if you give her the can of paint with the expectation of getting it back with enough paint left over for you to paint your room, that's going to be a big NO. She will probably dump out any leftover paint for revenge and you'll have to buy a can of paint for yourself.
