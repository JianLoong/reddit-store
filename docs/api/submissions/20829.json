Also, when I first saw \"flags,\" I thought you were going to say the coworker was going to tell you to hold up a red flag every time one of your colleagues asked/did something inappropriate. That would also be funny to me. \ud83d\ude05", "LOL NTA that\u2019s pretty funny!", "No, I think you're okay doing a harmless prank like that.\n\nFrankly, the only AH here is your CEO's assistant. Total ass for making you plan a celebration just because you look Mexican??? wtf is their problem?", "Until someone has the guts to actually ask you directly, go for it YWNBTA", "As long as you aren't offended by all their assumptions,  use them for your advantage. Start celebrating every holiday. Get some extra time off.", "Oh, I would absolutely starting being as confusing as humanly possible. Pepper your speech with slang from different languages. Bring all different kinds of foods to work, listen to all different kinds of music. Mildly hint to different people that you might be from different places without ever actually stating it outright. And if someone say something like \"but aren't you Mexican?\" \"Aren't you Muslim?\" just say solemnly... \"Wow. I'm really hurt that you know so little about me.\" and walk away.", "As a stealth Latino, I feel you. I love the rotating flag idea, or maybe swag from different nations' Football teams. NTA.", "NTA. My husband gets the same whenever we travel and often when we meet new people.\n\nCan I also suggest hanging one of those 'scratch off maps' in your office cubicle? Then scratch off all the countries of origin you've been mistaken for - Mexican, the Philippines, anywhere else that has come up. Keep scratching when a new one arises. I'd be petty and stop someone mid conversation to scratch if they said something new. I'd also be extra petty and write in bold letters above it:\n\n\n*\"WRONG GUESSES ONLY\"", "I don't really see the point in intentionally trying to confuse your co-workers about anything.

Maybe you don't care, idk, it all seems kind of childish.", "I'm a mixed girl from the US so I feel this v hard. Personally I wouldn't do the flag thing but rather respond differently when these things happen.  I got so sick of people doing this that I now respond with the breakdown of my European genetics (ex 50%Irish or whatever) or what state I was born in just so they admit they wanna know what kind of brown I am. \n\nBut if you're genuinely getting bothered at work it seems like a sensitivity training is in order.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t advise you do this unless you know your job is pretty relaxed. Someone might get offended and you could get in trouble bc retrospectively this is immature and doing pranks at the workplace is not the best idea. If it doesn\u2019t bother you that they make mistakes regarding your ethnicity, why \u201cpunish\u201d those for simply trying to bond with you over it? Just tell your coworkers you are middle eastern and leave it at that, eventually they will learn. In my case, I look white but have a Caribbean background (that is not white). It takes a little bit for non Caribbeans to understand that about me but it\u2019s not something I would try to embarrass them with a prank over. Basically, no matter how harmless the prank is, it\u2019s purpose is to embarrass/humiliate someone. So it\u2019s not an ideal thing to do at your place of work.", "YWNBTA this would be hilarious, and people need to learn to mind their own business anyway.", "INFO Your Co workers are violating US HR regulations, though you might not be in the US. Even if you were Mexican why we would you automatically be volunteered to plan a Cinco de Mayo celebration?\n\nSince this is work, I don't think tricking them with different flags is the right way to go.

Grown ups use their words", "YWBTA. I just don\u2019t see what the big deal here is if people are curious. You seem to be making a huge deal of keeping it such a secret as if it were a national security risk. Either tell them you don\u2019t want to disclose or let them know. This is not a big deal.", "NTA\nSeems harmless enough, if it becomes an issue just stop doing it and clarify your ethnicity. I doubt a bit of fun confusion isn\u2019t going to seriously harm anything", "NTA. It would just be funny.", "I think it\u2019s adorable.  NTA. I don\u2019t see why anyone actually needs to know your ethnicity.", "NTA, but file a complaint with HR first! That way they know that the problem exists, and so *you* can't be accused of being racist when responding to racism", "white people are REALLY bad at guessing ethnicity imo. luckily, my parents liked to make sure i was well-travelled and i had a lot of friends from different countries, so i\u2019m pretty good at it. one of my coworkers loves to fuck with people by lying about small things and one day he said something about being japanese and i said \u201ci thought you were vietnamese.\u201d he slowly turned and said \u201chow the fuck did you know that\u2026\u201d HIS LAST NAME WAS NYUGEN. like i get that most white people don\u2019t know but come on it\u2019s obvious\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "2 wrongs don\u2019t really make a right.\n\nI\u2019m tempted to say everyone sucks here but that\u2019s kinda extreme.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know, I mean it would be silly to do the flags thing, but also silly to put up a plaque that you can point to that says \u201cmy family is part this and part that, I was raised christian, etc\u201d\n\nActually, I\u2019m leaning towards an American flag (assuming you live in the United States of course) and posting a FAQ.
