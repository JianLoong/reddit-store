I just don\u2019t trust my own feelings at the moment. So, here it goes.\n\nMy inlaws (calling them that for my convenience, not married yet) have been going on and on about NEEDING to meet my parents. Not WANTING, no, NEEDING. They\u2019re very extroverted with a lot of friends. My parents though, most of all my mom, are very introverted and keep to themselves. They have no one but the immediate family, mostly due to a lot of trauma from their youth. My mom hardly ever gets out because of this, and deals with severe anxiety and depression.\n\nMost of all my mom struggles with meeting people, because she had always been judged and even bullied by adults. This causes her to not look forward to meeting my inlaws. They have seen eachother a few times while grocery shopping etc, and made small talk, but my mother in law wants to be friends, something my mom just doesn\u2019t want to. They don\u2019t respect this however, and she once again told my boyfriend I need to set up a meeting, that it\u2019s abnormal for my parents to not have met them yet.\n\nBeside all the mental trauma causing my parents to be so introverted, there have been severe life events over the course of me and my boyfriends relationship. In those 6 years, my dad got stage 4 cancer, my grandpa got severe alzheimers, grandpa died, grandma died, my mom got a lot of physical ailments, my grandma was hospitalized, my father nearly died 4 times, and the list just goes on. We\u2019re even holding off on the gender reveal for a month at least, because now the family dog has cancer and is getting a very extensive and severe surgery next week, and can\u2019t be left alone or brought to big parties. We love our pets as family, so pushing the gender reveal forward by a few weeks is nothing.\n\nBut now my inlaws are getting very annoyed, because of \u201cyet another excuse\u201d, and they should just get over themselves and meet them. My boyfriend agreed with them, which pissed me off, causing a big argument. I will always support my mom over his, because even though she desperately wants to be, she will never be more to me than a mother in law. My mom is my mom, and that\u2019s that. But now I am made out to be the bad guy for not actively pushing my mom into something she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing, all because my mother in law NEEDS it. They will meet at the gender reveal, but they think it should have never gotten to that before meeting eachother.\n\nAITA for not pushing my mom out of her comfort zone for their wishes?", "created_utc": 1696412202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zipgf/aita_for_refusing_to_push_my_mom_to_meet_my_inlaws/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one deserves that. I'm sure you don't want to become yet another contributing factor to your parents' trauma by trying to force them into a relationship with the Pushy McPusherin boundary stompers.", "NTA. Continue to support your mother and what she actually needs to stay healthy. Your \"in-laws\" sound awful.", "NTA\n\nOne of  my biggest pet peeves about adulthood is that somehow empathy seems lost and people are expected to follow \"social norms and hierarchy.\"\n\nHave you privately discussed with your MIL about your mother's struggles or is this something she is aware of and still continues to push your boundaries over? Is your mom aware of the pressure you're being put under by your boyfriend's parents? \n\nI myself am an introvert with years of heavy trauma, and may I say if I had been lucky enough to have a child I'd have been so grateful to have one as emotionally mature and aware as you. I would maybe recommend discussing whats going on with your mom to at least give her the place of making the decision for herself BUT you know your mom best and have a right to protect her peace.\n\nStay strong OP", "MIL needs to back off. You have explained your parents aren't very social people, they are shy and prefer their own company and have few friends. \\[i.e. don't need any more\\] Their personal trauma and health issues are none of your in-law's business, they don't have to explain anything.\n\nAs you have said, your parents aren't required to fulfill your in-laws 'needs'.  They will meet them at the gender reveal - no further negotiation needed.\n\n*\\[P.S. My husband and I have never met my son's in-laws and they have been married eight years.\\]*", "NTA.  There is no hard and fast rule that in-laws need to be buddies.  I think my mother and MIL and FB friends but I don't know that they have spent more than a few hours talking to each other is the last 24 years.\n\nExtroverts continuing to push introverts is just going to lead to an angry confrontation eventually.  Not everyone wants to deal with extroverts who are the equivalent of a slobbering, untrained dog who \"just wants to be friends.\"", "My partner and I were together for 12 years before our parents met, mainly because of the distance between all of us. Neither of our parents minded, they didn't push us into a meeting, there were no jokes/ jibes/ questions/ snide comments, or an \"Isn't it time...\"\n\nOP's in-laws should respect the no.

Having extended family support will be amazing once you give birth for your child and your own menthol health. \nHaving them meeting each other sounds quite reasonable. They don\u2019t have to be some BFF and play cards every night together but a minimum so to help in the future each other seems quite e a reasonable request. I mean if you have in line paid help for when the baby comes good for you, a night nurse taking care of a newborn for few hours cost an arm and a leg\u2026 but could be very well help for your own parents as seems they are all sick and soon with a baby you may have less time to care for them yourself. \nI will really work on keeping global peace and find a reasonable compromise.", "They need to get over themselves. Your family well-being and comfort is your main concern. You seem to be the only one with a sane mind compared to your boyfriend and his family. Your parents are going through some things that are emotionally draining as well and physical. Their top priority is their health and you. Your future in-laws can either respect not everyone has to like them or be their friend. I think it is sweet they want to have a relationship with your parents, but they also have to respect the decision if they don't want too. NTA and with the behavior your in-laws and boyfriend are showing you'll have some coming wars in the future. Good luck OP and I wish you and your family the best of wishes! \n\nBoyfriend and in-laws are AH for not showing empathy and being understanding.", "NTA i would like to tell you to dump this Family - but thats not an option anymore. But i think you should Set boundaries now to protect you from them ...", "Please show the in laws this", "NTA.\n\nMy MIL was exactly the same towards my mum (who doesn\u2019t want to be her friend). Your partner should tell his mum to back off, though I can appreciate that ain\u2019t gonna happen. I had to flat out tell my MIL my mum just doesn\u2019t like her before she stopped. Now she thinks my mum is horrible but so be it.", "Nta clearly they don\u2019t care about how another person feels. Keep up the boundary because you probably need practice for when the baby comes", "NTA! This is not kindergarten where you can arrange play dates to \u2018try\u2019 make them get along! If one party doesn\u2019t want to meet the other, they shouldn\u2019t be forced to do so. It\u2019s simple. Being introverted is not a crime. Your mother has every right to feel comfortable in her surroundings. If meeting the in-laws disrupts it, she doesn\u2019t have to go through with it! That\u2019s final.\nTalk your boyfriend and tell him about social anxiety and how debilitating it can be. If it was you who had this anxiety, would he force you too?", "Wow, as an introvert myself, I hate those kinds of extroverts. They sound pushy, exhausting, and exactly the type of people to not respect a boundary they don't understand or agree with.\n\nI don't blame your mom for not wanting to meet them, or you for not pushing her too.\n\nYou and your bf may need to sit down your \"in-laws\" and set boundaries and exceptions. Their POV is not wrong, but it is their own. Your parents have had different life experiences and have different outlooks on things. They are not wrong either. If your \"in-laws\" expect your parents to make an effort to meet the \"in-laws\" expectations and desires (to meet up), then they need to respect your parent's boundaries and needs too, or else you won't accommodate. One does not supersede the other, and putting off the meeting does not mean you are favouring your parents (I almost guarantee they will say this), but rather that you are postponing until a better time and arrangement can be made. Maybe suggest an open ended time to re-address the idea (e.g. in a few weeks/months, as you feel appropriate) and suggest a smaller meeting in a neutral ground, like meeting for coffee between the 6 of you (his parents, your parents, and the two of you). More intimate means less people/pressure, and easier to control. A coffee date is shorter than lunch, and can literally just be tea/coffee and cake, \"Nice to meet you\" and leave in 30 mins. Your \"in-laws\" are not fair to **expect** a longer meeting their first time round, and have to understand that this sort of forceful behaviour can be stressful and offputting for some people. Make sure to phrase it as \"you don't think your \"in-laws\" are bad people, and it is a valid request to meet them, but the how and when needs to work for both parties.\"\n\nWell done to you for understanding your parent's needs, as people, and protecting them from someone trying to bulldoze their needs in favour of their own.", "ESH. I'm very surprised by so many not the asshole ratings. MIL is an asshole for being so pushy and not empathizing at all...... but at least in my region/culture, it is completely reasonable to \"need\" to get to know your child's new parent-in-laws, especially when there is a baby or wedding tying you together. I don't think you and your mom are reasonable for REFUSING to this relationship. You're marrying your partner - your families are going to be legally linked. Any Good parents will want to get to know the people who are becoming their son's new parents-in-law.\n\nUnless there is active abuse/extreme estrangement from one set of parents, there's no excuse to refuse to introduce your parents to each other. Again, ESPECIALLY with a marriage and a baby on the way. Your mother has trauma, so its reasonable to set boundaries and take it slow, but you're both being unbelievably rude to refuse any interaction at all. You're right they dont need to become best friends. You're so so so wrong that they don't need to meet each other at all.\n\nWhat about if you and your partner have an emergency? Health related, severe car accident, anything - if your parents are your respective support systems, they should know and have at least minimal contact with each other.", "Yta. It\u2019s a dinner, they don\u2019t want to be friends they want to meet their family. Mother in law or not she\u2019s part of your family soon.", "NAH. Your parents are introverted and doesn't like to socialize. Have you told your inlaws that? \n\nYou don't have to give them a lot of details. Just say: \"My parents are very introverted and don't really like to socialize. It's nothing personal.\"\n\nAnd then try to arrange something SHORT (preferrably with distractions to take the pressure off) for their first introductions. Something like a festival with live music or a show or shopping. So they can chat for a little bit, have the distraction to lean on, and then your parents can excuse themselves.", "NTA, but it is a bit weird and If i were the in-laws i would just think they don\u2019t like me, especially if I didn\u2019t know any of those details. Hey it\u2019s life", "I would want to meet the parents of the person giving birth to my grandchild as well.  Most people want to know who their family is going to be around. I wouldnt call you an asshole but i dont think its a good look to deny them a meeting where they can actually get to know one another rather than a party where itll be just small talk. Imo the mature thing is to have them meet", "INFO. Have you talked to your mom about this?", "Info - what have your parents said about this?", "I'm an introvert and have found a lot of extroverts don't get it. And I've certainly not experienced the extensive trauma your Mum has.\n\nThe best you can do is have a quiet word with MIL and try and explain the situation. She may not understand entirely but hopefully will respect the situation more.\n\nPerhaps you could refer her to a bit of online info about introversion and trauma. That can help people understand a bit more sometimes.\n\nGood on you for respecting your Mum's feelings.", "Isn\u2019t this decision really up to your parents? It appears you are making this very difficult & I\u2019m not certain why. Why are you managing your parent\u2019s life? They\u2019re adults. \n\nAre you embarrassed by your family or your ILs? What do you believe is going to happen? I don\u2019t think this is about your Mom or Dad or your ILs. It appears you are super uncomfortable with them being around each other.

They will meet before the year is done, that is a fact. The whole BFF thing is kind of the problem though, since they already met briefly a few times and made small talk, but my mother in law wants a huge meeting with hours of getting to know them, and has even said things like \u201ctime for a big family christmas event\u201d, which is waaay too much for us.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, and I do agree. Only thing I would like to point out is that nobody is refusing to meet, they will meet and are open to do so. I probably didn\u2019t bring this across very well, but the part I\u2019m refusing is forcing my mom to meet them at a point in her life where she\u2019s gone through non stop hell for years on end now, and want to hold off the meeting until she gets a bit of a breather and feels up to it a bit more.

There just hasn\u2019t been a huge meeting because of so many circumstances, not even just those affecting my parents, but on their side as well. We have just always deciding that grieving, providing health care for family members, or even just processing all of those things, took priority over meeting someone new.", "I have, she was always willing to meet them, but not when she\u2019s at rock bottom emotionally. So she hasn\u2019t made any initiatives, and has sometimes asked me not to plan anything at that time because of life issues going on at that moment, which I always respect.

My mom is open to it, but there have been times where meeting them was last on the priority list, like when dad just came back from hospital at the beginning of this year. My mom definitely wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. And this time around, our dog is getting very serious surgery and needs to be taken care of, but my inlaws still wanted to meet during that recovery time. So I am refusing to force my mom into meeting at times when she\u2019s really not in the right state of mind to do so at all, not refusing to have them meet at all.", "You sure are right about this, I really am overprotective. I think at this point I am more scared than she is, because it feels like they\u2019re already judging her without even knowing her. She\u2019s been through so much hell over the past years that I got very protective.", "Thank you very much! Also thank you for the tips, a professional look on things really helps.", "Decide a date (before baby arrives) that works for everybody.\nI understand your parents have their very rightful priority but yes indeed your post made it look like they just doesn\u2019t want to meet them on top of everything. I mean sounds your in laws are at the moment the only one physically and mentally sounds to help you with a newborn. Might come n bite you in the ass the choice not to accomodate them a little bit (still regarding of course your parents priority)."]}
