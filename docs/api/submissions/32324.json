Hopefully no one is giving you a cheque because a) depending where you live 6 months later they could be worthless. B) if the person is budgeting that hypithetical cheque not being cashed could be problematic.\n\nIt's also worth considering that the giver wants you to read that card for the sentiment of the moment. Maybe you could think of some way to have them give you cards knowing you'll open it later.", "> I don't need any money that might be in the cards\n\nThe people who sent you the money might not be thrilled about this. It\u2019s money they could be using instead of you just letting it sit for who knows how long, and if there are checks in any of these cards, it\u2019s going to create a discrepancy in their bank balance as they are anticipating you depositing them.", "I'm going to go with NAH because your intentions aren't bad, but yeah, you're being rude as hell.\n\nJust open the cards an *don't read the messages*.\n\nNot for nothing, but I doubt those cards are going to be quite so helpful when you're acutely aware that your parents were upset you didn't even open them before.", "i think it\u2019s a lovely sentiment it\u2019s none of anyone else\u2019s business if you choose to not open a card.\n\nNTA", "How old are you? It seems your parents shouldn\u2019t be going through your stuff. \n\nThe only thing I can see that\u2019s negative here is not thanking someone who gives you a gift by specifying the gift. You can open the cards and not read the contents. Maybe that\u2019s a good compromise.", "NTA. I really do think you make the cards even more special by doing this. This is a really thoughtful and sentimental way of treasuring these cards, and I applaud your emotional intelligence. No joke. Try again to get your parents to understand why you\u2019re doing this. It really does sound like they\u2019re misunderstanding things. And if they can\u2019t understand it \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 then they\u2019re being TA here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents need to have their freedom to roam around your place restricted; they clearly don't know how to conduct themselves properly.", "NTA.   \nbut, mainly  \nWhy your parents are rummaging throug your stuff anyways?"]}
