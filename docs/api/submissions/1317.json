Feel free to ask for the info though if anything seems unclear.\n\nOkay, so I (m15) got into a group project for our music class with two friends of mine. We were supposed to give a presentation about an artist and had to do a handout and a PowerPoint presentation regarding it.\n\nLong story short I gave myself the handout because I knew it would be the hardest thing to do and I knew I would do most of the work anyway. Well, I handed in my handout in time and was expecting them to be done with their part. They managed to do six slides... We're supposed to have it in fifteen. And I wasn't able to correct it either since it was due already.\n\nSo now, we have to practice for the presentation and someone has to do the text about what we're gonna talk about. I told them I'd rather have them do it while I correct the whole thing because I didn't want to do the whole thing again and was just tired.\n\nSo they gave me back their text and did one paragraph. Like I wrote more down on this Reddit post than they did they had 2h for. After that, I got kind of mad and yelled at them that I'm not gonna do their whole shit and just went off.\n\nThey called me entitled and an ass due to my reaction and I want to apologize but I feel like I should stand my ground and not carry this whole project.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667593904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym9kkp/aita_for_being_pissed_at_my_coworkers_on_a_group/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
