Equally, whilst it's a conversation that needed to be had, the way you worded it in the moment was cruel. Explaining to him kindly that you are concerned he is pushing people away and offering to support him to find help would have been the right way to handle it.", "ESH. I mean, didn't you kinda do the same thing he did? Went for the jugular?

It's really almost a reflection of your parent's parenting. \n\nThey raised all 3 of you with great intentions, but clearly, issues still developed because they treated you 3 too differently. Now, in defense of your sister, you attack your brother. \n\nAll this started over dishes. Yes, your brother should've cleaned his plate to avoid the situation at all, Sis was correcting said behavior, then bro lay down his low blow. I'm all about defending a crying sister, but you have to do it right. You could've said \"Hey man, you really made sis cry over dishes, just clean the dish and apologize.\" Then his reaction would've stayed in his court and he would be posting about being the a-hole. \n\nThen mom and dad pick sides, which is not a position to put your parents in. \n\nYes bro needs therapy and so does everyone else, but he has to decide that he is ready and want it. \n\nPS: You are all in your 20's, sis is not going to be financially savvy, you learn through trial and error.

He was saying for her to stop picking on him, about something so tiny, when she has issues she should be focused on.   \n\n\nThen you decided to pile on and lash out at him in a completely inappropriate way. You were angry and not trying to help him. You were trying to hurt him for the way you saw him hurting your sister. The thing is, you ignore how your sister went after him over a plate.  \n\n\nAs such, and only for the way you lashed out at him, YTA.

While it's understandable that you were frustrated with your brother's behavior and wanted to make a point, telling him he'll probably end up bitter and alone was a harsh and hurtful statement. It's important to remember that your brother's behavior is likely a result of his difficult childhood and unresolved issues. However, he also needs to take responsibility for his actions and work on managing his anger and improving his relationships.\r  \n\r  \nEncouraging him to seek therapy could be a beneficial step, as it may provide him with the tools and support he needs to address his past traumas and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It's important to approach this suggestion with empathy and understanding, emphasizing that therapy can be a valuable resource for personal growth and healing.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's crucial for all of you to find a way to communicate and resolve conflicts in a more constructive manner.

Your brother said something cruel to your sister, and you're trying to use that as justification to say something much crueler to your brother. What do you think from the response, was it the right call? Did it help the situation? Will your cruelty be what it takes to convince him to see a therapist? Not defending what he said, but what you said to him is also indefensible.\n\nMaybe consider therapy for yourself as well; you and your brother seem more alike than you realize or would care to admit. You say he was faced with a minor conflict and went straight for the jugular...so what do you call what *you* did?", "NTA trauma is not an excuse to hurt others, he is no longer a child and he has done nothing to deal with his trauma just let it fester. he needs therapy or he is going to remain bitter and alone or worse in a relationship that6 turns abusive on his end.", "NTA.

If not your brother, one of the people you're closest to, who do you expect to open your eyes and make you see your mistakes ? \n\nI think he'll come around after some time, once he has calmed down. Don't be too hard on yourself.", "NTA.  Sounds like you told him some harsh truths he needed to hear.\n\nHopefully he reconsiders therapy.", "NTA. Sometimes people need to hear about themselves. His tough childhood is not an excuse. Nobody's is. Every person on the planet has had it tough in one aspect or another. You guys have offered Solutions to help resolve, and it just seems like for whatever reason maybe your brother just isn't mentally ready or he wants to stay in the situation he is in. Either way sometimes tough love includes telling somebody about themselves. If he wants to block you maybe he's doing you a favor.", "NTA. You or the rest of your family doesnt need to be subjected to his BS. You rightfully checked him.\n\nHe obviously has problems and perhaps another heart-to-heart with your parents could help. IDK how the last one went but they should at least apologize to him for being so quick not to believe him as a kid. That could help him getting into a better mindset going forward. Therapy of course is another solution but theres not much to do there if he doesnt wanna go. Just know that his refusal to get treated doesnt mean he can be a prick when he wants. Again, you rightfully checked him.", "NTA- Your language was harsh, but if he's turning down therapy and everything else, tough love is what's left.  He can't expect to treat everyone in his life as a punching bag.  Punching bags don't walk away but people do.", "NTA.  Sounds like he is already bitter and alone.  He sounds like he needs some counseling help and all you can do is try to encourage his getting it. Those around him deserve to be treated reasonably -- family, friends, colleagues.  The sooner he learns how to do this, the happier his life will be.  You all need to continue to encourage him to do this.\n\nI have a brother who also has a hard shell due to wounds from childhood so I know how this is hard to witness.  I always understood that underneath his brusk demeanor was a soft-hearted and easily hurt person. My brother was well into adulthood before he began to feel okay enough to deal with some of his issues and is now doing rather well, largely due to his wonderful and patient wife.  Support your brother as you have.  He may be mad at you now, but I think he needed to hear your words.  Hopefully he will soon allow you back in and things for all will be better in time.", "NTA. Siblings can say things like that, in times of need. It's not that you deliberately wanted to hurt him.", "NAH.  Why didn't he just wash the plate?\n\nYour brother needs therapy asap. I cannot begin to imagine the rage he must feel about being bullied and then not being believed.  Especially by his own parents.  Who were supposed to protect him. Probably like saying a rape victim deserved to be raped.\n\nWhile what you said was true, you could have been kinder about it.. I would block all of you.", "NTA he obviously needs help, but if he\u2019s against therapy he can\u2019t get it. But him needing help does not justify being an AH.

Your comment was designed to deeply hurt him.\n\nYou need to understand something. If you want to connect with your brother you have to absorb that his entire life experience from the family so far has been everyone and everything betraying him and normalizing it. That can actually cause cptsd and trauma issues.\n\nThe truth is he probably resents all of you. Your parents for abandoning him and never defending him. You for judging him freely, attacking him and not trying to see that he's scared to death of all of you. Your sister for not helping him. All of you for collectively being untrustworthy because of comments like that. You lashed out way more than he did.\n\nNow if you want to cut him off, what you said is the route to go.\n\n But if you want to push the family towards healing or connect with him, you need to think about how angry you would be if you grew up not only voiceless and terrorized, but also knowing through their actions that nobody *cares enough to help you*. Until you can reach an idea of how lonely and scary and painful that is, until you can grasp how angry it would make you for people to only notice you when you're nearly 30, you're never going to understand him.\n\nI've lived a similar life, only with more abusive parents. I got help. But his story sounds similar to mine and I know a lot of that lashing out comes from the fact that his instincts tell him every day that you're all going to betray him again one day so you're not really considered allies atm.

But this isn't it.\n\nBut again if the goal is to actually get the brother to stop, insulting him is only going to make him angrier, more resentful, and feel justified in lashing out. Telling him that his behavior is unacceptable, hurtful and alienating and placing a clear boundary by telling him unless he can address this behavior, you're going nc might break through to him. It might not but it's a lot healthier than returning hurt rage with hurt rage and hoping something good comes out of it."]}
