They didn\u2019t know where they were going wrong at the time & we were too young to articulate how we felt. We\u2019ve had several open conversations about it since, they\u2019ve apologised & we\u2019ve been a united front for the last 4/5yrs (minus some hiccups).\n\nWe were at our parents house over the weekend & my bro left a plate on the side after my mum had just done the dishes. My sister told my bro not to leave it, he got defensive & they started arguing.

You could have said all the rest (and even more) if you wanted to help your brother see where he's going wrong.\n\n--->Instead you went for the jugular yourself---which is why he's pulled away from you. If your intention was to break the relationship, then your words worked. If you were trying to diffuse and improve the family dynamic, you failed.", "ESH. He is AH for going for the jugular over a minor matter. You are AH for, well, also going for the jugular with your \"end up bitter and alone\" talk.", "ESH - He shouldn't have said what he said, it was uncalled for. Equally, whilst it's a conversation that needed to be had, the way you worded it in the moment was cruel. Explaining to him kindly that you are concerned he is pushing people away and offering to support him to find help would have been the right way to handle it.", "ESH. I mean, didn't you kinda do the same thing he did? Went for the jugular? I don't think either is really that harsh and don't understand why adults are arguing about a dinner plater, but if we are going there it feels like you and he had same action even if the impetus behind them were different.", "ESH your brother needs therapy and to apologise to your sister what he said was beyond asshole territory but if you lot would of just believed him and maybe helped him he wouldn\u2019t be so mess up", "ESH - Your brother should not have taken his low blow to your sister, and although noble in defending your sister, there are better ways. It's really almost a reflection of your parent's parenting. \n\nThey raised all 3 of you with great intentions, but clearly, issues still developed because they treated you 3 too differently. Now, in defense of your sister, you attack your brother. \n\nAll this started over dishes. Yes, your brother should've cleaned his plate to avoid the situation at all, Sis was correcting said behavior, then bro lay down his low blow. I'm all about defending a crying sister, but you have to do it right. You could've said \"Hey man, you really made sis cry over dishes, just clean the dish and apologize.\" Then his reaction would've stayed in his court and he would be posting about being the a-hole. \n\nThen mom and dad pick sides, which is not a position to put your parents in. \n\nYes bro needs therapy and so does everyone else, but he has to decide that he is ready and want it. \n\nPS: You are all in your 20's, sis is not going to be financially savvy, you learn through trial and error. Bro still has time to wade through his anger and become open to therapy before being old and alone. Chalk the fight up to being young and everyone exchange apologies.", "He needs to hear that. He really does. Just consider, though, that you did exactly what your he did to your sister, and your sister did exactly what she got upset over with him.   \n\n\nIt was a plate. She turned not washing a plate into a huge issue where they were arguing, knowing that your brother will eventually get triggered.   \n\n\nWhen he did get triggered (at least from what I've read here), it seems like he didn't really say something horrible; it was just insensitive. He was saying for her to stop picking on him, about something so tiny, when she has issues she should be focused on.   \n\n\nThen you decided to pile on and lash out at him in a completely inappropriate way. You were angry and not trying to help him. You were trying to hurt him for the way you saw him hurting your sister. The thing is, you ignore how your sister went after him over a plate.  \n\n\nAs such, and only for the way you lashed out at him, YTA. And even if he doesn't go, your family should consider anger management classes. You all seem to have issues with it.

You all need to learn how to have constructive conversations.", "You  criticize your brother but.... But... it's wrong for your brother to get angry and go for the jugular, but it's perfectly ok for you to do the EXACT SAME THING to him? I think I have a better idea why he's so angry... he gets abused by other kids when he was young, he gets neglected and/or abused by his parents, and then again by his sibling (s? Not sure if your sister does the same thing to him...) YTA.  \n\nHello pot, meet Mr. kettle.", "ESH", "ESH\n\nIt's a difficult situation, and tensions were high during the argument. While it's understandable that you were frustrated with your brother's behavior and wanted to make a point, telling him he'll probably end up bitter and alone was a harsh and hurtful statement. It's important to remember that your brother's behavior is likely a result of his difficult childhood and unresolved issues. However, he also needs to take responsibility for his actions and work on managing his anger and improving his relationships.\r  \n\r  \nEncouraging him to seek therapy could be a beneficial step, as it may provide him with the tools and support he needs to address his past traumas and develop healthier coping mechanisms. It's important to approach this suggestion with empathy and understanding, emphasizing that therapy can be a valuable resource for personal growth and healing.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's crucial for all of you to find a way to communicate and resolve conflicts in a more constructive manner. Family therapy or mediation could be helpful in fostering healthier dynamics and improving your relationships. It's important to approach the situation with love, patience, and a willingness to listen to one another's perspectives.", "ESH you aren't any different. He has anger problems sure but you don't get to put on the airs of defender when you do the exact same thing.", "NTA\n\nHe needed to hear that and be called out for his behavior, but don't expect him to change.", "ESH. Your brother said something cruel to your sister, and you're trying to use that as justification to say something much crueler to your brother. What do you think from the response, was it the right call? Did it help the situation? Will your cruelty be what it takes to convince him to see a therapist? Not defending what he said, but what you said to him is also indefensible.\n\nMaybe consider therapy for yourself as well; you and your brother seem more alike than you realize or would care to admit. You say he was faced with a minor conflict and went straight for the jugular...so what do you call what *you* did?", "NTA trauma is not an excuse to hurt others, he is no longer a child and he has done nothing to deal with his trauma just let it fester. he needs therapy or he is going to remain bitter and alone or worse in a relationship that6 turns abusive on his end.", "NTA. His comment was uncalled for and too far. And if he wants to be a successful member of society, someone needs to be the one to call him out so he can change his actions.", "NTA \n\nHe needed to hear it. If not your brother, one of the people you're closest to, who do you expect to open your eyes and make you see your mistakes ? \n\nI think he'll come around after some time, once he has calmed down. Don't be too hard on yourself.", "NTA.  Sounds like you told him some harsh truths he needed to hear.\n\nHopefully he reconsiders therapy.", "NTA. Sometimes people need to hear about themselves. His tough childhood is not an excuse. Nobody's is. Every person on the planet has had it tough in one aspect or another. You guys have offered Solutions to help resolve, and it just seems like for whatever reason maybe your brother just isn't mentally ready or he wants to stay in the situation he is in. Either way sometimes tough love includes telling somebody about themselves. If he wants to block you maybe he's doing you a favor.", "NTA. You or the rest of your family doesnt need to be subjected to his BS. You rightfully checked him.\n\nHe obviously has problems and perhaps another heart-to-heart with your parents could help. IDK how the last one went but they should at least apologize to him for being so quick not to believe him as a kid. That could help him getting into a better mindset going forward. Therapy of course is another solution but theres not much to do there if he doesnt wanna go. Just know that his refusal to get treated doesnt mean he can be a prick when he wants. Again, you rightfully checked him.", "NTA- Your language was harsh, but if he's turning down therapy and everything else, tough love is what's left.  He can't expect to treat everyone in his life as a punching bag.  Punching bags don't walk away but people do.", "NTA.  Sounds like he is already bitter and alone.  He sounds like he needs some counseling help and all you can do is try to encourage his getting it. Those around him deserve to be treated reasonably -- family, friends, colleagues.  The sooner he learns how to do this, the happier his life will be.  You all need to continue to encourage him to do this.\n\nI have a brother who also has a hard shell due to wounds from childhood so I know how this is hard to witness.  I always understood that underneath his brusk demeanor was a soft-hearted and easily hurt person. My brother was well into adulthood before he began to feel okay enough to deal with some of his issues and is now doing rather well, largely due to his wonderful and patient wife.  Support your brother as you have.  He may be mad at you now, but I think he needed to hear your words.  Hopefully he will soon allow you back in and things for all will be better in time.", "NTA. Siblings can say things like that, in times of need. It's not that you deliberately wanted to hurt him.", "NAH.  Why didn't he just wash the plate?\n\nYour brother needs therapy asap. I cannot begin to imagine the rage he must feel about being bullied and then not being believed.  Especially by his own parents.  Who were supposed to protect him. Probably like saying a rape victim deserved to be raped.\n\nWhile what you said was true, you could have been kinder about it.. I would block all of you.", "NTA he obviously needs help, but if he\u2019s against therapy he can\u2019t get it. But him needing help does not justify being an AH.

From what you say, in his mind, everyone in his life is not willing to stick up for him when it counts. So he responds in kind. \n\nIt\u2019s not right, and he has to take some responsibility for himself and recognize that people around him are trying to do better, but this was just you using his ways against him, which would never have worked. \n\nThe \u201cdie alone\u201d thing is also a little beyond the pale when striking back. That\u2019s a brutal thing to say to just about anyone who\u2019s struggling, let alone someone who has issues with trust and connection like your brother.\n\nFamily is messy and no one is completely in the right here, but when the ball was in your court you struck back with a vengeance that really wasn\u2019t warranted. Financial struggles hurt and family members using them against you hurts even more, but it\u2019s nothing like saying someone you love is doomed to die alone when you *know* that\u2019s probably something he actually fears, given what he\u2019s gone through in life.", "You\u2019re doing what his bullies did.

Your brother had to raise himself while everyone around him never believed him, punished him for things he didn't do, and was all alone. That can be extraordinarily damaging to a developing psyche.
