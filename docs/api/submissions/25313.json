Pretty sure she would have been one.", "NTA  \nFirst of all, a general thing: Maid of Honor is a role that requires a great deal of commitment to avoid stressing the bride out, and you shouldn't appoint someone to that if you aren't certain they'll be up to the task.\n\nOnto the specifics of the story. If you haven't spoken to someone in more than 3 months and they aren't family, they are likely not close enough to need a special notification of your life events. Clearly, she saw the Facebook post, that makes it sufficent. You aren't \"taking\" anything from her, either the MoH position or the wedding invite, because she is not garunteed these things. If a former friend ghosted me out of the blue for 10 months I would probably also not invite them to my wedding, lol. And it's not harsh to decide that you don't want someone who has made it clear they care more about insta clout than you as a person at your wedding. Especially if they seem like the type to start drama (which she does)", "NTA. This girl seems like she may be going through a lot personally, and for some reason, your personal news burst the pipe. \n\nRegardless of what's going on with her, it's ridiculous for most people to feel so entitled about their place in the fictitious engagement knowledge hierarchy.\n\nAlso, this gives me major Danielle on Summer House vibes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
