You are not a money pit for her. I say, be there for your niece and put your extra money towards doing that. Your niece needs a safe space with.

Your sister needs to get her life sorted out.", "NTA, helping them would be enabling it.

So if you ever call CPS or try to file emergency custody or anything like that, you\u2019ll have proof", "NTA are they substance abusers?", "NTA. Their mismanagement of their finances is in no way your fault. Especially when you have helped them out before and they didn't take those opportunities to shape it up. They need to grow up and prioritize their kids and stop blaming others for their problems. If the situation becomes more dire, are you able to care for her kids? Because like others have said, if they have no basic utilities and are forgetting to pick up their kid at school, it's only a matter of time before CPS is looking into it.", "NTA. They\u2019re trying to guilt trip you into getting more money. It\u2019s easier than trying to work for it themselves.", "NTA Tell them to get a second job  (and third if necessary). That's what responsible people do. Their problems are not yours. Let them figure it out.", "NTA, it's not your responsibility to take care of your sister and her family.", "NTA: If you want to help research for organizations that can help them financially.

Don\u2019t help and only help the kids because they\u2019re kids but tell them you cannot be the mother of their children and they need to take responsibility to earn money for their kids to eat and be able to take them places. Tell her husband to grow tf up and do something useful with his life.", "NTA- Coddling people like this never helps them. They just lean on you more and expect more each time. And if you pick up the slack then he will never even try to get a job. Do NOT put any bill under your name anymore. I\u2019ve seen friends do this and they end up in financial trouble and they will not care if your credit is ruined. This is not your responsibility. They are adults with 2 kids. Your sister needs to leave this AH as he\u2019s only dragging her down. Now, If she left her husband I can understand maybe helping her a little bit get back on her feet but I\u2019d never support them while he\u2019s sucking off her too. Save your money, as you get older more bills of your own will come. Maybe you\u2019ll need a new car etc. You should be saving this money for when *you* need it, and I promise you that you *will* need it.", "NTA\n\nYou only make $14/hour.  You are not responsible for their choices.  Remember that.  Their choices.  They chose to not pay the electric bill or phone bill. Their choice.  They wanted you to pay their insurance and you rightfully said \u201cNo\u201d.  Absolutely.  They need to find their own way.  Do NOT take on their bills, they will only bring you down with them.", "Agreed. OP says the niece is 12. Unsure of how old the other one is, but maybe OP can check in with the niece and make sure they always have food and things like that. If the parents continue not to pick up the kids in a timely fashion, CPS will probably be involved eventually.", "Thanks. I'm a very giving person. I'll help anyone. The money or tools mean nothing to me if it means I can help someone in need. But I have learned i need to say no to people to. It hurts that is my own family.", "The father grows pot.", "If they found out a child was living in a house without power they would have an issue because it limits the child\u2019s access to fresh food, they may actually help them get services though .", "Is there a way you can check in with your niece (maybe weekly) to make sure she and her sibling always have access to food and that sort of thing? I know it wasn\u2019t a specific issue in your post, but I would say if it ever is, putting your money towards that is better than bailing your sister and her deadbeat husband out of their issues.\n\nEven something like a few boxes of pasta, some canned beans, and a bag of frozen veggies can go a long way, and they\u2019re relatively inexpensive in comparison to a lot of groceries. 12 year old is old enough to be able to make pasta and throw some veggies in at the end.", "So where is the money going? There is more to this story that they are keeping from you.", "The father certainly isn't growing pot without any power at the house. If I were you I would call cps. If there isn't serious neglect you sister probably won't lose the kids, but maybe cps can help them get the resources ti atleast have power on and food in the house . I mean come on your niece has never been to Applebee's? That isn't a Michelin star restaurant or anything.", "I agree, and I actually think CPS should be called in a situation like this, but that\u2019s not my decision to make."]}
