So we agreed as a group to get him one gift card from all of us. All went according to plan til I found out that there's one coworker \"Claire\" who chose a different path and got him a seperate gift. The gift was a handmade wooden picture frame for him and his kids. Me and the other coworkers were puzzled by her move and we found it somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\nI mentioned it to her and talked about how inappropriate her gift was and how it seemed a little too personal. She acted confused and was like \"what's it to you?\", I pointed out how she should've just joined the group in the one gift we got John instead of getting a seperate one but she had an attitude saying she thought this would nicer and then, she lashed out saying it's non of my business. I told her it was just my opinion as well the opinions of some coworkers but she called me and them lazy and \"busybodies\" to be so hung up on what she got John. She said as long as he liked it then I better not mention it. I thought her tone was rude.\n\n\nMy coworkers are on my side.

John is the newst in the company and this christmas was our first major holiday together...as a group I mean.\n\n\nNgl, We were at a loss as to what gift we should get him. So we agreed as a group to get him one gift card from all of us. All went according to plan til I found out that there's one coworker \"Claire\" who chose a different path and got him a seperate gift. The gift was a handmade wooden picture frame for him and his kids. Me and the other coworkers were puzzled by her move and we found it somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\nI mentioned it to her and talked about how inappropriate her gift was and how it seemed a little too personal. She acted confused and was like \"what's it to you?\", I pointed out how she should've just joined the group in the one gift we got John instead of getting a seperate one but she had an attitude saying she thought this would nicer and then, she lashed out saying it's non of my business. I told her it was just my opinion as well the opinions of some coworkers but she called mr and thrm lazy and \"busybodies\" to be so hung up on what she got John. She said as long as he liked it then I better not mention it. I thought her tone was rude.\n\n\nMy coworkers are on my side. Some others say they fail to see how this is a big deal but again, I was just giving her my opinion.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
