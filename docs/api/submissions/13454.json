Due to budget, professors from the same department all have an open desk format in our office. \n\nOne day, I walked into the office and saw someone who was sitting at a desk. They had a lunch out and were working on a laptop at the desk. They had hand tattoos which is common for many of our students and looked young, and were twirling their hair and doing repeated weird movements. If I had to guess this person looks like he is in his young 20s. So I assumed too young to be a full professor, maybe an adjunct or student?  \n\nI set my stuff down at my desk and then walked up to the person and asked \u201cAre you lost? Is there a professor you are looking for and can help you find?\u201d \n\nThey looked at me wide eyed and answered \u201cI\u2019m a professor here\u2026\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. I nodded and walked back to my desk. A couple weeks passed and I saw them again in the office today. And asked \u201cWhat do you teach?\u201d They answered what they teach and kept it at that. I tried to make small talk but they wished me a good day and packed up their stuff and left. \n\nTurns out they have been a professor here for a few years with top scores, remarks from students, and top fellowship/scholarship/research. And apparently a lot of the faculty in the department have stories of how their students say how much they adore this professor and my colleague found it odd I never heard of them.

My guess is you\u2019ve unconsciously blocked her out because she doesn\u2019t fit your idea of a professor.

Of course one is a little bit baffled if someone, who doesn\u2019t looks like he is a faculty member sits at a desk and working/eating there. Especially after OP\u2019s comment, that they never got a formal introduction at a meeting etc. So I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to ask them, who they are respectively if they are looking for someone or if they are lost. It\u2019s per se a neutral question to which OP got a neutral answer.\nMaybe OP could have been a little bit nicer in her reaction, but I do not believe that qualifies her as an AH. \nOn the other side I can understand the professor being very reserved towards OP. \nIf I were OP, I would probably just come clean with the professor and explain the situation to her and put it down as embarrassing for me.\nSo overall NAH.", "A mistake like this does not an asshole make.

At least the person who spoke similarly to me had the decency to apologize afterward", "\"Hi, I don't think we've been properly introduced, I'm NAME\".\n\nREALLY not that hard. How would you have acted if you had been talking to another colleague and this person came up to join your conversation? I'm sure you wouldn't have asked \"are you lost\" or \"are you a student\".\n\nYTA.", "I\u2019m a professor with blue/purple hair and I look younger than my age. I get mistaken for students often. But I\u2019m a 37F assistant professor (soon-to-be associate professor). Generally speaking, a person doesn\u2019t make full professor until they\u2019ve been in their tenure-track job for 10 years (assuming US system - 5 years to associate, another 5 to full). If you figure someone is 22 when they graduate undergrad, a fair guess for when they graduate with their PhD is 28/29. That means most people are almost 40 by the time they are promoted to full professors. If the person legitimately looked mid-20s, I would never in a million years think they were a full prof. That said, it is entirely likely OP assumed the person is mid-20s due to their tattoos/mannerisms, which is just a bad way to gauge age. And using age to determine rank is not a stellar proxy, either.\n\nAll that said, it is always awkward when people assume you\u2019re new, or a student, or whatever, when you\u2019ve been there for years (I speak from lots of experience). Better phrasing, as others have suggested, would be, \u201cHi, I\u2019m XX, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Then if they think it\u2019s weird you don\u2019t know them on sight\u2026 well that\u2019s just pretentious.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You made a lot of judgments, apologized for none of them, and perhaps accidentally did the exact same thing when you asked them what they teach. That likely came off as questioning them again, especially since those are the only conversations you've had. Perhaps you can start again with a few key phrases that indicate respect, even if you don't respect them.\n\nYou also seem to generally not have a lot of respect for young folks.", "Short answer is when you mess up, you apologize. A simple \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. We haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m \u2026\u201d then _not_ interrogating them the next time you see them. Bonus points for passing along how embarrassed you were for your gaffe.", "I\u2019m not sure. My guess is that he was on boarded during the pandemic, when we were virtual for longer than most colleges and were only doing online department meetings. So unlike other faculty, he was never introduced in person at a faculty meeting. He also is a little bit of the academic orphan because he is housed in our department but the only one in his field. And we haven\u2019t worked on faculty councils together.", "Depends on the tone. Could of been quiet genuine", ">What I don't get is, you're smart enough to put two and two together.\n\nThey're smart enough, but they're also so incredibly biased that the idea that someone can look like *that* and still be a professor is still incomprehensible to them. \n\nYTA", "Why would she have to apologize? She meant what she said and even though the wording could come off as passive aggressive a bit there's nothing wrong with the general idea imo. The person looks young (which is nice, isn't it?), has nonconforming looks and yet has accomplished career. Good for them. Their response should've been just 'thanks for the compliment, dear colleague'.", "Absolutely not. That's super awkward. I wouldn't want to go to lunch with someone who my only interaction with was them rudely treating me like a child. But, in a small department where everyone knows each other, I'd also be afraid of saying no.", "An apology would be in order.", "OP did not apologize.", "> And you're not responsible for his impolite reactions.\n\nWhich ones? Quote them.", "Cool young vibes don't mean they're not professional. It's just means that they look young and OP is biased in thinking they're not good enough to be a professor at that age.\n\nIt's hard not to be surprised when you have been working there for years and received praise from students and faculty, and someone still judges you by the cover and thinks you don't belong.", "You're a teacher? Doubt it. You're a dumbass.", "Oooh, what post?", "The only time to ask someone if they are lost is if they are looking around, confused. This woman was sitting and working, minding her own business. I\u2019d definitely be insulted if someone randomly approached me with that kind of question.", "Asking someone if they're lost, no matter the tone, directly implies they do not belong where they are.\n\nThere are ways to address a person you are unsure of who they are and why they're there, but the outright \"are you lost\" to someone that is 1) not at her desk 2) quietly working and 3) not bothering her is quite rude", "No, I don't thank people who are rude and imply that I'm somewhere I shouldn't be, while I'm sitting quietly at my desk minding my own business.\n\nAnd who takes \"are you lost\" as a compliment?", "Generally the person who creates an awkward situation or makes someone uncomfortable, are the ones to apologise for said situation and making someone uncomfortable. \n\nIt's nice until it effects dating and work life. You have to put in extra effort to be taken seriously, only to end up being condescended to or patronised, even if it is unconscious.", "The comment was not \"You look young.\" It was \"You don't belong here.\" Either way, she made a mistake, and \"I'm sorry. I didn't realize\" hurts no one.", "Right. That\u2019s why I am suggesting she apologize and move on. This is really not a big deal, but she\u2019s blowing it up in her mind. If the guy is a dick and doesn\u2019t accept the apology just because she mistook him for a student, then that\u2019s his issue.", "Dumbass teacher indeed", "She was implying they don\u2019t belong where they are. That was the whole post. She confused them for a student", "Right, but she didn't, which makes her an asshole in this situation.", "I understand that. But again, implying someone working quietly at a desk is in the wrong place, without any other information, is rude.\n\nAlso, she was wrong.\n\nThen, she didn't apologize.\n\nShe's the AH."]}
