You were not rude, you were just stating the obvious. If your colleague really wanted to know how Mike was doing, he could have called him himself instead of relying on you to relay the information. You are not Mike\u2019s secretary or spokesperson, you are his friend. You have no obligation to update everyone on his life or whereabouts. Your colleague was being lazy and nosy, and he deserved to be called out on it. You were just defending yourself and your friend from unwanted gossip and harassment. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.

It's understandable that you're tired of being the go-to person for updates on Mike, especially when it fuels rumors about your relationship.

You are nicer than me. I would have been more sarcastic. \n\nIf only they made a way to communicate with people and send quick messages asking them how they are doing.

Good job shutting him down.", "NTA for not wanting to be a middle man, but YTA for the way you said it.
