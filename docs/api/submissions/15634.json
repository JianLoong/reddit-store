He sent our mom a pic of a bigger house than the one he bought while she was out of the country grieving her father\u2019s loss, and told her it was all paid for upfront (no mortgage). She let him sign on her behalf. They started investing in a business in the homeland so he convinced her to \"retire\" for a few years on our savings, until the business picks up.\n\nMy dad had secretly married another woman during his business trips to Africa and had 3 children over the years. Also turns out, our house that he said was paid for \"in cash\" was under a mortgage and my mom only found out years later. The previous business was sold for 1.5 mil, our house for just under 700k, and the new house was worth about 255k, so you do the math. \n\nWe found out that he was always a cheater in Canada too, & would flaunt his mistresses and money in front of people, and would talk badly about my mother behind her back our whole lives. Now he got money and spent all those years blowing it on women in Africa, ran that new business to the ground, and married another woman after impregnating her.\n\nHe stole my elder sister's tuition fund my mom saved for her (over 50k) and tried to take mine too.\n\nI'm still in shock today as to how little we actually knew him because of all the horrific stories we hear about how he treated people, and how he treats us now ofc. I feel like the money and status he got while married to my mom (first business was hers before they married) got to his head and he made a series of bad, selfish decisions that are biting not only us, but him in the ass too.\n\nHe did all that just to be broke in two countries and have 8 kids and two wives that he can't provide for.\n\nBtw, he fully renovated our old house before selling it but then bought a dirty old house in a random town with less space for our big family of 7, with no intention of living with us. My mom trusted him and he deceived her, and still ruins our lives today.\n\nA week ago he sent an email saying he is out of the country because his sister is in a coma and won\u2019t be able to pay the mortgage for 2 months. I was feeling bad until I found out that he recently took an extra loan of 150k to take his new wife travelling. Now the total amount owing for the mortgage is more than the og price of the house. He even sent divorce papers and said he will let us keep this house in Canada if my mom convinces her cousin to give back for FREE the house in Africa HE sold to her in the first place. I thought he is using the story of his sister to guilt trip and pressure us into trading houses and not paying the mortgage. I made a comment along the lines of \u201cwhat about it\u201d. I truly didn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t care about her illness, more about his grief because I hate him.

This includes any doubt & mistrust that are a result from years of lying.\n\nHis behavior appears to be sociopathic, and you're well within your right to safeguard yourself & loved ones against further potential financial & emotional ruin.", "NTA\n\nQuite frankly, I wouldn't believe a word this man says.", "NTA. \n\nHE CRIED WOLF TOO MANY TIMES FOR ANY OF US TO BELIEVE A WORD THAT COMES OUT OF HIS ASS", "I am so sorry, your dad is criminally fraudulent. If half the things he had done had not been done to family and been reported he would probably be in prison. I would not believe a word he says at this point. NTA, your mother should get legal advice and divorce immediately to try to get what assets she can if there are still any assets.", "NTA but I understand you\u2019re likely under a lot of cultural pressure to \u2018show respect.\u2019 But let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s a crook!", "NTA Your mom apparently was raised with a certain cultural mindset that allowed her husband to treat her and their children badly while she just is patient and long suffering in enduring his shenanigans. You are more realistic and less forgiving. Hopefully your cousin will tell your father to pound sand but dear old dad will use it as an excuse to keep defrauding and financially abusing your mom. Best wishes on escaping that man\u2019s clutches before he figures out some way to use you as a financial asset.", "NTA,\nIf I was your mom I would sue him to hell and back. Then divorce him for everything he has trust me karma will bite him in the butt one day. And don't feel guilty for what you said to him I would go NC with him.", "She should divorce him because as long as they're married he'll keep bringing her to financial ruin.", "I don't understand as well: did the mother not divorce immediately after she found out all of that? Is she not suing him? Why is anyone caring about a sister or anything concerning this lying piece of nothing good?\n\nThe whole family should cut him out and only talk through lawyers with him to get as much money back as possible. Nothing else.", "Your mom is the AH...he can't get away with all this if she didn't turn a blind eye. She needs to get out of this herself.", "NTA and protect your assets. His sister is probably fine considering there's no way to determine how long she can't pay the mortgage due to being in a coma. Could be 3 days, could be 3 years, and that's a very specific amount of mortgage he wants. \n\nAlso, Africa is not a country.", "NTA. But from all this mess, I would suggest legal advice for your mum so she can be as protected as possible.", "He can\u2019t legally use the divorce to get back a house he sold to someone else either. \n\nAnd he\u2019s already married while not divorced from OP\u2019s mom? That\u2019s bigamy. (At least). Bigamy+ his thefts and adultery mean she should have the upper hand on any divorce negotiation.", "Amen. She needs to pull her head out of sand and start working on getting out of this mess or you will be her retirement plan OP. She does not get to sit back and be hopeless. She needs to take charge for once and take responsibility for herself.

How negligent and naive is she?\n\nAt this point, she is abusing you as much as your dad.\n\nShe needs to divorce him (after filing bigamy charges), dump as much debt and bad property on him as possible, and never contact him again. If she won't, you need to get to realize neither of them can be relied on and get as far away as possible.\n\nYou and your siblings need to make sure your dad isn't committing identity theft with your information, because I doubt he'd be able to get loans and credit in his name anymore, and that's the next logical step.\n\nNTA", "Why aren\u2019t they divorced yet and why don\u2019t you have a lawyers suing him until he\u2019s in the ground? He committed fraud, stole and who knows what else. Lawyer up and sue his ass. Do not listen to a word he says. NTA"]}
