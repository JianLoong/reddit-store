When she realised she was not going to be home \"early\" she should have let you know so that you didn't need to worry.", "NTA she\u2019s lying. It doesn\u2019t take anyone that long to get a lift. I\u2019d be more worried why she\u2019s lying.", "NTA Sorry, but my SO rolling in at 5am is just not okay - particularly given the paucity of communication through the night.", "NTA. She was out for almost 12 hours, I would be very curious what she was doing. Depending on where you live, bars aren't even open past two. And with no explanation of where she actually was who knows what she was doing. Could be nothing, but sounds nefarious. And if she's mad at you for being mad at her that is screaming guilty to me.", "My partner used to do this all the time. \"I'll be home early.\" ...5am or later\n\nI eventually got sick of it and said, \"I assume you will be home well after I'm asleep unless I hear from you earlier.\" \n\nDidn't necessarily stop me from waking up and wondering where they were, but it did stop them lying to me.\n\nNTA", "Please don\u2019t jump straight to \u201cshe\u2019s cheating\u201d like so many commenters seem to want you to. Her behavior sucks. But it\u2019s also the behavior of immature drunk people. NTA for being frustrated here.", "You were up all night worried about her. She doesn't get to give you attitude.  NTA  Don't let her flip this onto you being the villain.\n\nHer aggression could also be a cover for her hooking up with someone that night.", "I think NTA. she should be able to communicate better when her plans change unexpectedly. I'd be worried about my partners safety if they weren't home hours after they said they'd be. I think it's silly that she is digging her heels in and saying you shouldn't be annoyed, because it sounds like she's accusing you of being controlling but the way I see this it's a safety concern. If she had originally said, \"don't worry about me I probably won't be home until late\" or even updated that things looked like she wouldn't be getting back until late, that'd be one thing because you'd know not to expect her. But when she says she's going to be home by a certain time, you expect that and probably plan your evening around it.", "NTA, she should have communicated better about her timing so you would know to just go to bed. She clearly had no reason to assume you would be asleep.", "It doesn\u2019t take 3.5 hours to get a car home. I\u2019d be worried and upset too especially if I texted at 10pm and didn\u2019t hear until past 1am. Absolutely NTA", "NTA\n\nOf course you should be annoyed! That\u2019s very annoying behavior. You should at the very least get an apology.", "Sorry bro, something is amiss here. She\u2019s cheating on you, emotionally if not physically.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Im that\u2019s shady and lacks common decency to update your worries partner", "NTA\n\nYou aren't annoyed about canceled ubers and that she had to look after drunk people. You are rightly annoyed b/c you didn't realize how late she was staying out and you were concerned about her well being when you couldn't get in touch with her. She should have communicated with you better so that you knew what you expect. Next time, you should clarify what she considers late and verify how/when she plans to get home. You are not her babysitter, but she needs to understand that her safety is important to you.", "NTA because she was inconsiderate you have legitimate reason to be a bit cross. but don't let everyone here make you think it means she was definitely cheating. Drunk people aren't the best at timekeeping or consideration for others, especially when they're with a group because everyone ends up waiting for everyone else. People can fuck up without it being relationship destroyingly serious. It's not impossible that she was but there's no evidence. People on here hear hooves and think zebras over horses", "NTA, it's courtesy. Even if she was just your flatmate, I'd be up worried if they told me they would be home early, and I didn't hear from them until 1.41am.\n\nShe's being emotionally manipulative, and honestly, it seems likely she's cheating.", "NTA but I strongly disagree with comments accusing her of cheating. She drank, other people drank, and it ended up being a late night. Next time...go to sleep.", "NTA\n\nShe is most certainly lying about what happened that night, and does not want you to know. \n\nMajor red flag, cheating.", "NTA. Perhaps when she says \"early\" she actually means \"early in the morning.\" Or, she just doesn't care about you or her obligations at work. There are some big red flags you need to be paying attention to here. If it keeps happening, sit down with her and ask what's *really* going on when she's out until the wee hours of the morning. Don't let her deflect, either. Keep asking her and get to the bottom of it.", "NTA- she is completely irresponsible for staying out until 5 and blowing off work.", "NTA. You \\*should\\* be annoyed.", "I guess... But she was having a night out. And she was fine in the end. Let her be.", "Why did you wait up and monitor her every move instead of just going to bed?", "NAH\n\nSeems to be a spate of these lately.    Look, at a certain point you just go to bed and let her worry about herself.  She's a grown up.   It's understandable you're irritated, but this just really isn't that big a deal in the great scheme of things.    Of course she's irritated -- she's likely hung over and it sounds like she had a fairly rough night.  Both of you just need a good night's sleep and to let it go.", "YTA \n\nUnless she was bailing on plans with you, why does it matter what time her work drinks last until?", "5AM is really early in my house....but seriously, NTA, I'd suspect she got her some.", "ESH:  \nWhy are you texting your girlfriend so much when she's out with friends? This seems very controlling.\n\nI don't understand all these N T A comments. She's an adult. Is there a reason you think she is not capable of taking care of herself? \n\nShe might have planned for an early evening but seems like she had to take care of drunk people. The only thing she did that was an ah move was texting you she was taking a taxi home and you waiting. But then, why are you waiting for her?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m Canadian. I was so mad. I could have stayed in town and gone to a friend\u2019s place before the party. I called at midnight and said I might be late. Got home at 4:30. He was mildly shocked and asked where I\u2019d been. I told him he missed a good party and went to bed. Hope he had fun with the Liberals.", "NTA perse, but the question is what you achieved (or were hoping to achieve) by being and acting angry at her. I am pretty sure that past midnight she wasn't \"going to be home early\" anymore, so from that point on you had two paths:\n\n1. Keep getting angrier and more resentful with every hour that passed.\n2. Be angry/upset, but use the time to calm down and prepare for a calm conversation where you would address what you  didn't like about what happened and why.\n\nSo you went for option 1. That doesn't make you the AH, but it did prevent you from being constructive.", "NTA She lied and kept you awake all night. What was she doing?", "'going to get a taxi' doesn't in any way mean she was saying she was waiting for a taxi, it means that she was planning to later", "I was thinking the same thing. Most bars I know aren\u2019t open past 2-3. Heck most usually close at 1 for me. What was she doing for almost ~2hrs after they closed?", "Agreed, she likely got caught up in having fun. It happens to the best of us. I think her poor communication is the problem here but not worth ending the relationship over for a one off occurrence.", "That's my problem with this... why did he wait up all night worrying about her? Why didn't he just go to bed? So strange to me.", "> But when she says she's going to be home by a certain time, you expect that and probably plan your evening around it.\n\nShe never mentioned a time...", "I\u2019m with OP on this one. It sounds like OP waited up to make sure she was okay. I\u2019ve done the same with my husband. It\u2019s a respect thing. If you\u2019re going to be out later just say that. Not the end of the world. But the key issue here is her lack of communication.", "You're allowed to text your significant other when they're out. And you're allowed to be a little annoyed when they said they won't be out late and come in a 5 am. She should've at least communicated when she knew she was going to be out a lot later than she initially said.", "In this context, it absolutely means that she was waiting for a taxi or was about to call for one.\n\nOP was not concerned with **how** she's getting home. He was concerned with **when** she was getting home, and I feel that that was clear to gf.", "2 hours is a pretty long journey", "Because she kept saying I'm on her way lol. If she said I'll be home at 5.30 from the jump, I'd take my ass to bed.", "Why go to bed if you aren't tired because you worry about your partner. There is no point in going to bed", "Have you ever been up waiting and worrying on a loved one? You can\u2019t just go to sleep. Or you shouldn\u2019t be able to if you care for them anyway", "She mentioned early when she left. Texting at 1 in the morning saying she was going to get a taxi isn't early.", "She communicated that she would be getting a taxi later. \n\nOp is apparently incapable of being in bed alone", "Why are you worried about a grown adult who is going out for drinks with friends, though?", "If my loved one is out for drinks with friends I'm not up and worrying for them, I'm sleeping because I trust them to go out, have fun, and come home when they're done. They can call me for a ride if needed.", "At 1:40 in the morning, she said that after telling OP at 6 that she would be home early due to having to work.", "She said she was going to get a taxi. The implication was that she was leaving then. The fact that she said that at 1:40 and didn\u2019t get home until after 5 is a problem. I understand if you\u2019re not in a long term committed relationship this may not seem like an issue but she\u2019s completely lacking respect for her partner in this instance."]}
