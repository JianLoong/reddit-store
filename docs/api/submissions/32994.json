One of them has a boyfriend who is almost always here, even when his girlfriend isn't. I have always had a habit of going braless in my own home, hence why I choose to live in an apartment were it was only girls for comfort reasons, however he is unexpectedly there all the time. Nevertheless, his presence doesn't stop me from not wearing a bra. \n\nRecently, my roommate has come up to me asking if I could wear a bra whenever her boyfriend is over, so always. I rejected it because I felt more comfortable without. She said it was just weird for her and her boyfriend when I don't wear a bra because I'm not close with them and it's like seeing a strangers tits. \nI don't wear see through shirts or tanktops where it is overly visible, but tshirts and sweaters where you can see the outline of my boobs but not it themselves. Therefore, I didn't really see the problem, even more so since it was my home. \n\nOne of my other roommates said it was awkward that I don't wear a bra at home especially since there was a guy in the house a lot whose dating our roommate. She kinda made me rethink this situation, because maybe I wasn't being considerate of them. \n\nSo, AITA for making my roommate and her boyfriend uncomfortable for not wearing a bra?\n\nEdit: So there have been questions about my second roommate's opinion and needs clarification. She doesn't mind me not having a bra, she just thinks it weird to not wear one when around men. Even more so when that man is dating someone you live with. About why the bf is always here, I don't know. One of my roommates told me he lives with his mom but I assume it's because he and his gf have a baby kitten they're raising and she has 8 hour workdays and can't leave them alone for a long time, so her boyfriend takes care of them while he is (presumably) a student.

If they noticed, I guess they kept it to themselves. (American)", "Shit I'm sitting at the office not wearing a bra right now. I haven't worn one in years.", "agreed, op is definitely more blessed and the other girls are being insecure.", "Exactly.", "Ok, a guy here, please explain something to mee. OP write that she is not wearing tanktops etc, so her breast are not out in the nude.\n\nSo the difference seems to be between breasts pushed up/together or them hanging?\n\nWhat's the difference? They are not getting smaller in a BH? In moat cases they are more prominent in a BH...\n\nSo is it just the illusion of free swinging breasts that is a problem?", "Oh how I wish to be perky.  I\u2019\u2019m envious", "Really?   What brand?    \nNursing bras feel like scaffolding, they\u2019re so itchy and oversized it\u2019s like wearing this gigantic extra item that I hate.", "It\u2019s time that the tenants review the terms of their lease.  The roommate\u2019s BF is closer to being an additional roommate than being a short term visitor.  His long-term presence could be jeopardizing - even violating - their current lease, which could cause a swift eviction for all.  If I was a roommate, I\u2019d be questioning his \u2018student\u2019 status, as he appears to be closer to \u2018freeloading\u2019 off of his GF, perhaps because he doesn\u2019t like living at grandma\u2019s place, or because it\u2019s more convenient to his school.  Hmmm\u2026..free rent, water, electricity, wifi\u2026.Does he contribute groceries, clean the place, take out garbage?  Oh, wait\u2026.he takes care of a kitten!  Maybe his one contribution is emptying the litter box.  He\u2019s created a \u2018job\u2019 that makes him indispensable to his GF.  What happens to the kitten/cat when they break up?  As a homeowner living near a major university, I see MANY cats released into the city at the end of the second semester every May.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking!! A comfy bralette or sports bra. Technically, she\u2019d be fulfilling their wishes!", "I hate wearing bras at home but also have too big of boobs to feel comfortable without some kind of support. Found a great wireless shelf bra that feels more like those built in bras that are in tank tops but better and I wear them constantly! Bought one in every color.", "Kinda depends on the boobs and the person viewing them I suppose. Going braless can mean that the boobs move around more and are a little more noticeable and can also mean that you might be able to see the shape of a nipple through the fabric.   \n\n\nThe solution is for the roommate and her boyfriend to get a grip and stop looking.", "I have big boobs but have been braless for a decade because no bra - even sized correctly - has been comfortable after I had back surgery. Instead I wear slightly snug tanks under everything when I leave the house.\n\nAbsolutely no one has noticed. Work hasn't, my close friends didn't notice, literally no one.\n\nMy only exception is I'm forced to wear a fancy cocktail dress that's low cut and requires 'cleavage' :p", "It's ok. The uniform has a vest. I usually wear a cardigan, too. There's no physical danger. \n\nOnly psychological.", "Lol.  Touch\u00e9", "Same plus I hate anything that\u2019s tight that I have to pull over my head lol so annoying", "That's a shame. It really does depend where you are. In the times where I didn't do it I was pretty young and working at a very liberal type place where I was also mostly in a lab coat/ causal loose fitting stuff so idk if anyone cared, I didn't anyway. \n\nNow I'm a bit older and in a more professional role I don't make a habit of it", "Pretty sure this is it. When I was breastfeeding there's no way in he'll I could use a sports bra comfortably. Even mat bras left my shoulders sore. Now that my kids are older and I've dropped the baby weight, they're super comfy", ">when the boobs are small maybe they are not the menace they are to me.\n\nSmall boobs here and the only bra I am comfortable wearing are sports bras but not the racerbacks because they become painful to my neck and shoulders.  To me racerbacks are just as uncomfortable as the wired bras.", "Negative Underwear has non-racer back options and some bralettes that you pull over the head instead of having hooks. Also sports bras all the time are a terrible option as the compression can cause anomalies in the breast that show up in mammograms, and then you have all the follow ups and drama of thinking you might have cancer.", "For me, my problem is my boobs are too small. I have been professionally fitted multiple times, and I've never found a bra that isn't uncomfortable. Many stores don't even pretend to sell my size. The fact of the matter is, my boobs don't need support. There's not enough substance to hold a boob cup in place, they just shift everywhere and cause chafing, and I put holes in my shirts readjusting them all the time.", "uhhhh...", "I usually wear / need a good compression sports bra for when I work out. Outside of that, I don\u2019t normally wear them at all. \n\nI will check out the recommendation. Thanks!"]}
