OP sucks less than her sister but this is not okay.", "And you believe this?", "I'm so shocked at how many people think it's ok to post the kids. For me it's not even about having the parents permission, their mum is already posting them behaving badly on social media and I don't like that she does it either. Noone should be posting videos of kids in their worst moments it's so unfair. If my partner was behaving really unreasonably he'd be totally in his rights to be upset if I posted a video of it, even if he was 100% in the wrong. But also, Angel sounds like a nightmare parent.", "OP also uploaded another one that wasn't posted before", "It would still be no contact forever from me. I can post my kids, I control who sees them, not my sister. \n\nBut even if you ignore the link, you have OP posting an entirely original video.

It's still not okay for OP to re-post them or their links, and she should still take them down.", "That\u2019s true, however op admitted to posting the other video that was taken, which is wrong.

OP doesn\u2019t have that same right as they\u2019re not her kids. \n\nI\u2019d give a different verdict if linking the post Angel made on her own was all OP did, but posting another video is AH behaviour. Especially because it\u2019s showing the children at their worst, and it\u2019s not their fault they have a terrible mom that refuses to parent. They deserve privacy, and the video should never have been posted, honestly none of the videos should be online, but yeah OP was an AH for putting the video of the kids on the post. Stuff like that can follow kids into school and get them bullied, and it can even surface in adulthood.

I don\u2019t get parents like that. I do share my kid on social media but not the hard times. That\u2019s there forever. He doesn\u2019t deserve that.

That doesn't change the point.", "Posting videos of children behaving badly is shaming the children as well as the mother, no matter what the OP's intent was.", "And there was no way to defend herself without shaming minor children online? She couldn't, IDK, use her words?", "It doesn\u2019t authorise op to do so. Op doesn\u2019t own image rights of her niece and nephew", "Good for OP, in my opinion. I bet her sister will think twice before trying to sic the social media mafia on her again.", "Publicity isnt the problem that makes op AH. She posted videos of children on social media. That isn\u2019t ok \nShe should\u2019ve done a comment saying what the children usually do and why she won\u2019t invite them", "I am. That\u2019s why I think op is also an AH", "What? OP got attacked on social media and she's not entitled to present evidence in her defense? You're out of your freaking mind.", "True that. While I empathize with OP and would say NTA, posting Megan's video without permission is not a wise move. Also it would drag poor Megan into this mess.", "Right? Even the link bothers me, but the new video is super not ok. I cut off contact with a family friend until they removed a post about sensitive medical information. If it\u2019s not your kid, you shouldn\u2019t be publishing about them.", "Why wouldn't we believe this?", "If it's to clear my name, then yes. I will use every piece of evidence in my artillery to prove that I am not the bad guy. It's not my fault if you forget that I have evidence and decide to take something public.\nNot to mention, if you've already shared the video once laughing and claiming you find it entertaining, then why is it all the sudden an issue when I simply share the video or link it to the post you're now talking about? If you've already shared the video once, it's already out there for people to see. It's not my fault you uploaded evidence that would have contradicted your statement.", "so its ok for angel to post bad thing about OP, but its not when OP exposes her", "so OP's in the wrong for posting the kids, but Angels in the right for posting about OP? how does that make sense?", "why should she. angel posted bad things about OP, so OP exposed her. why should OP take her post down if angel doesnt", "I don\u2019t think anyone should or will be embarrassed about a video of them from when they were 7 or 10.

Angel is the one who tried to tarnish OPs reputation ONLINE. So why is it a problem that OP went ONLINE to clear her name ? If Angel didn\u2019t want her bad parenting online, she shouldn\u2019t have made the post in the first place.

Plus... why tell Angel the *exact* reason when \"I'm only inviting adults (over 16) so S & P won't be able to attend\" is equally valid and true.  \n\n\nWhist I acknowledge Angel's 'parenting' style makes having them there less than attractive they both stirred up drama", "Angel lied about a private conversation and made unfounded accusations.  That's called fuck around and find out, if she didn't want her kids shitty behavior public she wouldn't have shared the video, the problem is her narrative got destroyed so she's mad.

That being said\u2026 do I agree this was the right move? No. I personally wouldn\u2019t go this route- I don\u2019t think anyone should post anything- especially photos or videos of anyone\u2019s children without consent.

Nope, it's not. \n\nIf they keep behaving like they do as teens and adults, then it would be quite different, since, as an adult, you have tools to try and deal with issues related to you upbringing (and even then, it's not always the case), but they are children that no-one is parenting (neglect is abuse, remember that), helping their mom to showcase these episodes is quite awful.\n\nAs I've said, you didn't upload them originally, but sharing them is still in a grey moral area.\n\n>My parents told me that I was in the wrong for sharing those videos, because everyone\u2019s children have acted up and posting those videos didn\u2019t accomplish anything besides embarrassing Angel.\n\n>They also said I could have compromised by having a \u201cNobody under 18\u201d rule for my birthday dinner.

AITA For not wanting to make compromises for my birthday dinner?\n\nYour parents are also wrong big times: for starters, your sister is abusing her children by neglecting to parent them, she should be embarrassed of herself and ashamed for the harm she is causing to them.\n\nEveryone's children act up, but acting up as a normal outcome of a balanced, healthy childhood and acting up because you are being raised like a barbarian are two very different things, your sister is setting them up for a life of failure, distress and pain.\n\nMoreover, they are also wrong in wanting to exclude Megan to be \"fair\": Megan, Sofia and Parker are in three very different age ranges, so you can expect from them very different behaviours and skills.\n\nNo-one in their right mind would ever think than a 7yo and a 17yo would behave similarly during a birthday celebration and this should have been your line: \"I'm sorry if you believe that I hate your children and I'm hurt by this accusation as I believe I've always showed my affection, but considering that it's my birthday and I want this kind of birthday celebration, I do believe that Sofia and Parker would be out of place and that they would get tired and bored quickly. I'm sorry if my actions could have been interpreted as me hating my beloved niece and nephew, but I believe that this event would be inappropriate for them, while Megan is almost an adult and is expected to behave as one. Love has nothing to do here, I was being considerate of everyone involved.\"\n\nWould your sister kept escalating the situation, you could have simply stated that your decision was final. Would she have sent more flying monkey, you could have simply told them \"I'm deeply hurt by my sister's allegations, but if you feel like they are somehow founded, I would never push you to come. I'm glad that you are showing your support to my sister and saddened that you will not attend, but I hope we will get the opportunity to celebrate other happy moments together in the future.\"\n\nSometimes going nuclear is not the way to go, sometimes you have to kill them with kindness and courtesy, keeping very distasteful video out of the picture.\n\nAnd don't get me started about your sister...", "I\u2019d never post any kid pics without kid and parent permission.   Think it\u2019s really creepy.", "A little bit the Asshole for posting the videos rather than taking the higher ground.", "Look, the sister sucks, but I embarrassed for a 27 year old who feels the need to organize a formal birthday dinner for herself. Grow up, you're not 12 years old.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think ANYONE should be posting videos like this of children online. Feels too much like public embarrassment. Their mother is immature for posting all that stuff about you, but also for posting videos of her children throwing tantrums. IMO tantrums aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s business but the parents (who should be properly handling them). I think you could\u2019ve defended yourself without reposting the videos, and talking to her in private as well. Those kids are gonna be humiliated in the future if they find these posts.", "ESH. Your parents were right, you didn't accomplish anything by posting those videos, you just made yourself look like an asshole. No one saw that and decided they were on your side instead of your sister's.", "Also ESH. maybe should have sent the family members the video of the kids misbehaving individually instead of posting it online", "Yeah it's ridiculous.", "To mock the idea that they have to set an 18 and older rule to avoid singling out people. It\u2019s called being passive-aggressive.", "I get that, and I saw the comments about the fact that it was already shared - but the videos shame the kids as much as the parent, whether that was the intention or not, and I still think it was not the right way to handle it.", "Oh yeah, because someone who watches their kids fight and swear at each other definitely is going to be into feedback from their family. You cannot get someone who clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit except when she gets called out to do a better job. If it was that easy, we would have a whole lot less to talk about on this sub.", "They *say* hands off parenting, but *mean* **too fucking lazy to bother parenting**", "Same for me but with dogs. It takes so much strength not to say anything.", "Ah, yes... I hate that.", ">letting her choose her own (weather appropriate\n\nI am having trouble with this one with my 7 yr old. It is currently winter and is still insisting on short and shirts for play clothes (school uniform he wears long pants and jumper \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). I have given up on the arguments and just started deciding whether or not I am packing him a jumper, jumper and long pants or if it's just a trip to the store to get milk, I let him suffer. As soon as we walk in the store he says \"mum I'm cold\" I reply \"this is why I told you long pants when you got dressed and to grab a jumper before getting in the car\", then he doesn't want to walk to the cold section to get milk but I remind him he wouldn't have been cold if he wore warmer clothes. As soon as we get home he puts his jumper on and I think, great I git through to him only to have to repeat the whole experience the next morning.", "I went through this with mine. She overheats easily. My solution was to tell her we have to bring it, just in case. She didn\u2019t have to *wear* it, but just have it. It was an argument at first, but she came around. I also let her pick out her own stuff at the store. I would tell her a number the coat could cost and we couldn\u2019t go over it. So it was a small lesson in budget too. She learned that we have to look at prices, not just what\u2019s pretty. When the coat was her own choosing, she was much more willing to bring it! \n\nRaising a child (especially a headstrong one) is like trying to drive blind. You know where the turns are in theory, but the execution of said turns is hard as hell lol", "Same. The helicopter parents are almost as bad as the don't care parents", "Yeah, I just keep their jackets in the car as a standard during winter, and my baby change bag has enough room to chuck in a pair of pants for him when I know we are going anywhere for more than 30mins. Mind you, though, this is a kid who will wear flannel pjs and sleep under a doona in summer \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. He is just stubborn.", "I feel that lol headstrong kids are hard as hell to raise", "Yeah. My sister's are like apache helicopters and since I was so much younger treated me like that.\n\nIf I have kids, I'm likely to do the opposite because I remember how weirdly stifling it feels", "Your sister is the one that took it to the Internet and the family and our friends and who knows else shaming you, lying about you.\n\nYou had every right to defend yourself.\n\nYour sister is TAH.", "I have zero sympathy for parents who have their children kicking and screaming at them but refuse to shut down their tantrums. \n\nMy aunt used to buy my nephew a toy to stop his tantrums or ice cream.

Back when it was 3 kids.\nIt was a nightmare. I was pregnant, nauseous and had a brain splitting headache at the time.       \nThese kids were running through the house. Knocking over stuff. Jumping on my bed and pulling things out of the draws. One of them was banging really hard on the tv and screaming. And that\u2019s when I snapped. It was a secondhand tv but replacing it would be money we didn\u2019t have at the time.             \nSo I said Oi! That\u2019s enough! Sit on the couch. And gave him a kids book. Gathered the other kids and sat them on the couch. Gave them something to occupy them. And told them it was quiet time.\nWhen I sat down. The mum said \u201coh good, I was wondering when you were going to say something!\u201d\nI was confused and I said, sorry I didn\u2019t want to overstep. Their your kids.\u201d\nShe smiled and told me.. to my face. That it\u2019s my house and my stuff so it\u2019s my responsibility to look after it.\nWut?\nOnce they left. I told my husband the whole thing. \nThey have never been invited in since. When we do get together it\u2019s at a park for a family BBQ.", "NTA. If you act unbearable don't expect people to bear you.", "NTA. As soon as someone else takes it to social media to shame all bets are off.\n\nAnd I get it. When I got married (courthouse) we held a tiny reception at my dad's house and my nephews were not allowed to come. At a time that I wanted to spend with my closest friends and family, I didn't want to subject them to listening to my sister scream at them from the couch the entire time for misbehaving, it not working, and her screaming more, and setting my dad off. If someone were to think back on that time, all they'd remember is *that*.\n\nShe threw a fit but my parents understood and I don't regret it.", "At seven and ten my kids didn't throw tantrums and yell at me. Occasionally they yelled at each other (cause brothers) but they had learned that when they are feeling angry to step back and get calm before talking to other people or trying to resolve the problem.  \n\nThey  weren't always GOOD at it, but they tried, and I always gave them credit for trying."]}
