A DNA test was carried out and confirmed my brother was the biological father. It was a very emotionally taxing time because my brother carried a lot of anger knowing his ex, who he had parted on good terms with, never told him. The only reason he can think of for why is she had always wanted to move back to her home town in another state and did not want to be forced to stay or share custody with a long distance parenting plan, and so never told my brother as a result.\n\nThe social worker in charge of the case mentioned the maternal grandparents wanted to retain custody of his son and that his son wanted to remain there, but as the biological father he had the right to take custody. My brother was called by the maternal grandparents and they, along with his son, asked for my brother to say no to custody. But he wanted his kid and forced him away from the family he knew so he could live with my brother, SIL and their kids (11, 9, 7 and 5).\n\nThings are not going well. My nephew is angry that he was taken from his family.. He doesn't want to know my brother. He does not want a relationship with SIL or the kids. He's angry and is refusing to engage in the therapy my brother put him in. He ran away twice. He has had lots of trouble in school, which is not surprising really. It's been rough. He talks to me some. He told me as far as he is concerned they can all rot in hell and if he's hurting their \"poor little feelings\" then it's too bad so sad and they better get used to it because once he can, he's going home and won't speak to any of them again and fuck blood because blood means fucking nothing. It's worth noting that his maternal family are not blood. His mom and her sister were adopted and he is aware of this and does not have much of an interest in blood ties generally.\n\nMy brother and SIL are frustrated that things are not starting to show signs of improvement.

Who cares that mom and sister were adopted, that is irrelevant. Did grandparents know who the father was and keep it secret too? Did the kid even know who is father was, or was he even told that his father didn't know he existed? What has he been told all these years? Did he have a father who he thought was biological, or was he told he was abusive or deadbeat? There are things embedded in this kids head. I feel like father was wrong in removing the kid at the point that he did. He should have met the kid, got to know him and what is best for him. I mean is he a good kid? Does he have a friend circle? how is he in school? and his community? What kind of relationship does he have with moms family? These all need to be answered.

They took that kid as an infant from his father.\n\nIt may not have been the right choice, but its the one 99.9% of people would make.", "I'm not sure this response belongs in this thread.", "A judge has to be involved in order to remove a child from their parent\u2019s custody against their parent\u2019s will. Social services can\u2019t simply do an investigation without an actual allegation of abuse or neglect.", "So what word would you use to describe OP's brother? Out of the loop father?", "Momma put him on the baby certificate, that\u2019s hardly kidnapping, it\u2019s a textbook case. What if the grandparents aren\u2019t a good influence, we don\u2019t have all the info here", "His intentions don\u2019t matter. His children are suffering and when someone tries to tell him that kindly, he reacts like a childish asshole. \n\nWhen you have kids you don\u2019t get to let your trauma effect them. Instead of developing a relationship between his older son and himself he\u2019s now guaranteed they\u2019ll never have one and other kids might resent him as well, especially the 12 year old. It has to be hell living in that house for the younger ones when the solution is simple. The oldest can go back to living with the family he knows and Dad and the rest of the family can visit over time and work to building a relationship if that\u2019s what the 15 year old wants. Honestly I can\u2019t believe his wife is putting up with this, there is no way I would allow my children to be treated like this when there is an alternative option.  \n\nHe is literally destroying his family and won\u2019t do the right thing to fix it. He is a bad person and parent and undeserving of sympathy. If he is angry and traumatized that his son was kept from him, he should go to therapy and work through it. Not force everyone else in his home to be miserable.", "I literally said that, for the kid to call and say he is being neglected, and he is having issues with home life, due to placement. He should have the ability to get a child advocate in his state to articulate his desires to the court. You may not call it abuse but that\u2019s not for you to decide that\u2019s for a judge.\nHe\u2019s at the age he can petition for emancipation. \nYour focusing on the parent, I\u2019m focusing in the kid. I have worked with kids emancipated from 12-18. \nBut they have to start the process as well. The child clearly can articulate his issues to op about not seeing these people as any sort of familiar figure.", "> he's now meeting\n\n*kidnapping", "A victim of his exes selfishness, just like their son is.", "Intentions always matter, it's what separates a good and bad person.\n\nYou don't magically get the ability to compartmentalize trauma when you have kids or reach a certain age. \n\nEverything else you said is with the benefit of hindsight. The kid could have just as easily hated OP for not fighting hard enough and only seeing him occasionally.\n\nWhat else was OP going to do? Hope that he can build a relationship while the kid is still with the family that kept him from his father? That he could build a relationship with a child states away by visiting occasionally? Move his family to where this child is?\n\nIt's a fucked up situation he did not create and is now dealing with and he doesn't have a lot of good choices. \n\nLeaving the child with his maternal family would have the least negative impact on the dad's relationships. But then how does dad live with 'abandoning' his child again? Or having a child he never gets to know? The guy did not sign up to be a sperm donor."]}
