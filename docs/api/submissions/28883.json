She died but had put my brother's name on the birth certificate and so my brother was contacted. He never knew she'd had a child let alone his child. A DNA test was carried out and confirmed my brother was the biological father. It was a very emotionally taxing time because my brother carried a lot of anger knowing his ex, who he had parted on good terms with, never told him. The only reason he can think of for why is she had always wanted to move back to her home town in another state and did not want to be forced to stay or share custody with a long distance parenting plan, and so never told my brother as a result.\n\nThe social worker in charge of the case mentioned the maternal grandparents wanted to retain custody of his son and that his son wanted to remain there, but as the biological father he had the right to take custody. My brother was called by the maternal grandparents and they, along with his son, asked for my brother to say no to custody. But he wanted his kid and forced him away from the family he knew so he could live with my brother, SIL and their kids (11, 9, 7 and 5).\n\nThings are not going well. My nephew is angry that he was taken from his family.. He doesn't want to know my brother. He does not want a relationship with SIL or the kids. He's angry and is refusing to engage in the therapy my brother put him in. He ran away twice. He has had lots of trouble in school, which is not surprising really. It's been rough. He talks to me some. He told me as far as he is concerned they can all rot in hell and if he's hurting their \"poor little feelings\" then it's too bad so sad and they better get used to it because once he can, he's going home and won't speak to any of them again and fuck blood because blood means fucking nothing. It's worth noting that his maternal family are not blood. His mom and her sister were adopted and he is aware of this and does not have much of an interest in blood ties generally.\n\nMy brother and SIL are frustrated that things are not starting to show signs of improvement. My brother mentioned that the kids have been upset by the rejection and wanted to know why he was so mean to everyone and didn't give them a chance to be a family. I said nothing to him and just heard him out but he said I had a look on my face and asked me about it and then I told him he should never have made his son move in. I told him he went against what his son wanted and now he was living with the consequences. I said whether he likes it or not, his son doesn't give a shit that he's his bio father. He cares that when he was grieving the worst loss a kid can imagine, he was torn from the people he loved to live with strangers.\n\nMy brother said he did the right thing and he could love them too if he would give them a chance.

Just plopping the kid into a pre-existing family was a recipe for disaster.\n\nWell, the fool brother has created a mess but it's his son who's suffering for it, and the only thing to do is to start FAMILY therapy rather than just sending the kid to a therapist, because no dependent child can be treated without family participation.
