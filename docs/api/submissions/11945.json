When I say this child could run a sub 5 second 40, I say this because I saw it. My dog hasnt even barked once. Theres no reason this makes sense, but I understand and appreciate the situation. I have friends that are in the same.\n\nMy neighbor asked me to not walk my dog to the bus stop anymore because 1) it scares her child and 2) they have to drive him to school. \n\nI had her repeat it just to make sure I heard right. Then I replied no. She was shocked and asked why. I said its unreasonable. Next thing is I cant walk down that way at all, or if her child wants to go up the street I have to put my dog in the house? Would you ask someone at the park with their dog to kindly leave because her child doesnt like dogs?\n\nNeedless to say, I dont think we\u2019ll be invited for their cookouts anymore.\n\nSo?", "created_utc": 1678454253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11noyym/aita_for_not_leaving_my_dog_home_to_walk_my_child/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The mild inconvenience of not taking your dog to the bus stop does not compare to the terror that kid apparently feels when they see the dog. They really aren\u2019t asking a lot from you OP.

That's like what, 10-15 mins tops?  \n\n\nNot to mention this is a young child that you \\*know\\* has autism. Why is it a surprise to you that he might be afraid of dogs? And why doesn't it disturb you one bit that your actions are terrifying a young autistic child?", "YTA. They aren't asking you not to walk that way at all, or to keep your dog in the house. Just not to take your dog to the school bus stop in the morning, a place where their child has to go in order to catch the school bus.

Is that something that might work for you and your dog?", "YTA you won\u2019t make a minor inconsequential change to your daily routine to assist neighbours you are friendly with and their autistic child because of all the imagined oppression this \u201cslippery slope\u201d will lead to.  Gross.", "YTA Raising autistic children is HARD. Your friend is asking you to do her a small favor to help her get her child's school day off to a good start (instead of with a flood of adrenaline), and you are refusing because you've leaped to the conclusion that she will try to control where your dog is at all times. That's an unfair assumption to make about a person who has thus far made one small request. If you want to get a sense of whether the small request could become a large request, you should have a conversation with *your friend.*", "YTA. \n\nYour dog is HUGE. I don\u2019t care how cute it is, it\u2019s threatening \u2026. And I doubt it\u2019s \u2018placid\u2019 yet if it\u2019s a puppy.   \n\n\nThis child with ASD is using every shred of energy it has to get through the school day. If you talk to people with ASD they say it is a gruelling marathon to just EXIST in school. So this kid\u2019s EVERY school day is going to be faced with a huge fear just as they are to get on the bus. A bus they a) have every right to be safe on, and b) NEED to be on to learn to cope with social norms, and c) their parents need them to be on because heaven knows those parents have so many demands on their time because of this kid that the bus is a God send.   \n\n\nBut that\u2019s ok. You keep walking this puppy right up to that little kids face because you have the right. It doesn\u2019t matter if it drops that kids self regulation down to the floor every day, making their first three periods of the day a dysregulated mess, which probably makes most of the day a mess, forcing the parents to deal with more and more issues at school. \n\nBecause you get to walk your dog where and when ever you want.   \n\n\nThey aren\u2019t asking you to stop walking it to the park, or around hte block, or whatever. Just to the FRICKING BUS.   \n\n\nYou are an AH mate. Through and through.", "I'm autistic and I'm a professional whose job it is to explain autism to other people, so I'm going to give this a go in case you really just don't understand what's happening here.\n\nWhat you're describing is happening to the child is autistic elopement, which is an autistic crisis point (like meltdowns and shutdowns).  This means a neurological event is taking place inside the child's brain, over which the child has no control.  It is causing INTENSE distress to the child.  At the beginning of the school day, no less, where they have a whole day of dealing with sensory input that's likely is difficult for them on top of multiple other things (it is not at all uncommon for autistic children to be so traumatised by school that they are later diagnosed with PTSD so there's a high chance the child is already having to cope with distress every day as it is).\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any particularly compelling reason you need to take your dog to that specific place at that specific time every day.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, you're refusing point blank to even consider changing your routine in a minor way to ease the extreme distress of a child you claim to care about?  Of course YTA!\n\nDo you HAVE to do as your neighbour has asked?  No, of course you don't.  I also don't HAVE to smile nicely and wave back to my kids' friends when they come out of school and wave at me enthusiastically.  I could scowl at them and tell them to leave me alone.  I wouldn't be arrested for it it, it wouldn't be illegal.  But I'd be a giant AH and everyone around me would know I'm lacking in basic human empathy, and would judge me for it.  Just like people will judge you...", "YTA- This request is not unreasonable. If you're worried about her requests becoming unreasonable, as in not having your dog outside period, then say no.

It doesn't seem like a particularly long trip. For someone you consider a friend you're causing them actual hardships purely out of stubbornness.", "NTA her situation is not your problem.  Her kid is going to see many many dogs in the real world. She needs to help them cope w dogs.  She can\u2019t ban dogs from the world", "YTA. Such a freaking minor request, and you're digging your heels in like you're Zelensky at the Russian border.\n\nRelax. Leave the dog at home. Be a decent person. It's so minor to be nice, and you're blowing up a friendship and making a kid scared.", "NTA because it\u2019s your right to walk your dog whenever you want, but- you\u2019re a pretty terrible friend. \n\nThose of us with kids who have autism have to consider and plan for a lot of things other parents don\u2019t have to think about. Once a child goes into meltdown mode, it\u2019s hard to come out of and wrecks the whole day. When your child has a difficult enough time at school, just to be there and learn, you try to mitigate any additional stressors. She asked you nicely if you would consider not bringing your dog- since you refuse, she has to drive him to school every day. Her option is to send her kid to school a mess or do the best she can and take it upon herself to transport him because her supposed \u201cfriend\u201d is unwilling to show her disabled kid some kindness. \n\nSome things in our lives are not technically \u201cwrong\u201d- it\u2019s a public street and you have a right to bring your dog to the bus stop. But when you\u2019re a decent person, and especially if you\u2019re friends with someone, if there\u2019s something you can do to make someone else\u2019s life easier- something that\u2019s not really a big deal to you but is a very big deal to them- you do it. My child has autism and I\u2019ve encountered my share of people who don\u2019t care to help make him more comfortable. Aside from legal accommodations, no one is \u201crequired\u201d to. But it sure is nice when people think \u201chey, this kid struggles and I can do something to help him\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH, but you sure aren\u2019t kind.", " YTA. If you are walking your dog in a place where that family/ child can easily remove themselves, that is within your right. Like a random walk down the street. However. You are walking the dog to a shared bus stop. You are preventing that child from using the bus. That area might be free game when it isnt being used as a bus stop, but for the period of time kids are waiting for/ getting on/ off the bus, it is not free game IMO. Like people bringing their dogs into stores where dogs are not allowed and it is not a service dog. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be the asshole for doing it one time and listening to the request. But YTA for not listening to the request.\n\nAlso, my opinion might be different if it was a typically abled adult person who \u201cdidn\u2019t like dogs\u201d or was \u201cscared of dogs\u201d. But it is a child who is neurodivergent, and people who you had previously be friendly with. \n\nYTA for throwing away being neighborly for a reasonable request.\n\nI would apologize and say you thought about it and realized the bus stop being a shared space means you were wrong to being your dog and you won\u2019t do it anymore.", "NTA. You cannot expect the world to bend around a disability. If his kid has a phobia of dogs, sorry to break it to them, but dogs arent going to vanish. \n\nExposure helps with phobias. I have a contractor/husband of my friend who was phobic of dogs as well until he started coming over to my house to do work. He was around the dogs over and over and over again> Started off terrified, now he can pet them and they don't bother him at all to the point that he and his wife just got their first dog.", "NTA\nWhat will this mother do when someone has a service dog that they have to have around??

You can always walk your dog any other time, in any direction you want once the child is on the bus and at school.", "NTA.", "YTA-- You are just walking your dog because you want to, that child has to ride the bus because he HAS too. You can walk your dog any old time, there is no reason to traumatize someones child and throw off the whole families schedule with rides because you wanna walk your big ol goof of a dog.

She is an AH for asking, when she should be trying to help her child cope.

If I were asked to leave my dog at home, I would assume the best of her, that she's really been trying and is frustrated and at her wit's end and just leave the dog at home. It's not that big of a request on her part, really.", "YTA. Take the dog on a walk at a different time of day. You are purposely altering how the childs day goes(fear before school/getting home) because you couldnt be assed to leave the dog at home for 10 minutes.

To be purposely difficult? What specifically is your reasons for HAVING TO take the dog with you to the bus stop?", "INFO: is your neighbor driving them to school because they want to, or because you won\u2019t leave your dog home?\n\nIf that child is meant to take the bus and can\u2019t because you will not leave your dog home, you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nFact is, you do not NEED to bring your dog with you. And if it is affecting that child\u2019s life so badly that they can no longer use the transportation provided by the school, you are not only an ass, but the reason that you will lose that friendship. \n\nA child\u2019s needs will ALWAYS outweigh your wants. Wanting to bring your dog to the bus stop, if it impedes on a child\u2019s life, is a dick move", "YTA.

We\u2019re talking about a designated service for children and their parents. Your neighbor expressed that you bringing the dog makes this service inaccessible to them and their child.\n\nDespite what others users have said, it is not your responsibility to expose this child to the dog to toughen them up or to help them get over their supposed phobia. So anyone suggesting that can come off of their high horse. That can be addressed by the family with the help of a trained professional only.\n\nYTA because your routine, which could be easily changed, is making a *service* for your neighbor and their child inaccessible. You would be less of an AH if you tried to work out a compromise, so for example, walking the dog but keeping a distance between the dog and the bus stop. ultimately you are not responsible for their child.", "From someone who's autistic I'm gonna say NAH with a soft YTA. This is a specific time and place that the child knows the dog will be there and it's not as simple as fear. Equally you have the right to walk your dog in a public space, and kiddos mum has the right to ask you to consider this. Tough spot tbh.", "You\u2019re NTA but I think you\u2019re also correct in assuming friendship probably not going to continue on either. Not much you can do about that unfortunately. You\u2019re entitled to walk your dog in public areas. And as other have said, you\u2019re not willing to offer any sort of compromise.", "NTA unless there\u2019s a law banning dogs from bus stops you should be able to walk with it when you want to. \n\nI know people are calling you out for making a child uncomfortable but the truth is that parents can\u2019t control everything in an environment. They should be focused on teaching their child how to cope with things that scare them rather than dictating to other people.", "YTA. The fact that you had to invent a bunch of hypotheticals that would make your neighbor the AH make that clear. They have asked you to keep your dog away from one specific place at one specific time so that their child can use a resource that has been provided for them. If they end up asking for any of those hypotheticals, feel free to come back for a judgment that may be more favorable to you, but YTA on this one.", "YTA - The child is afraid when going to the bus stop... which means it will be in close proximity to your dog.

And this is supposed to be your friend....", "YTA\n\nThe neighbor didn't say you had to keep your dog locked in the house 24/7 or never go for walks down the street. This request was specifically not to take the dog to the bus stop because her *special needs child is terrified of dogs* and freaks out and runs when he sees one. I worked with autistic children, and this is a very real safety concern, especially when you are talking at a bus stop next to the road with parents leaving for work in the morning when there may not be good visibility.\n\nThere is zero reason your dog needs to be at the bus stop. Absolutely none. Leave the dog at home. YTA.", "NAH\n\nShe's not wrong to ask and see if you might accommodate her child.

Your dog is on leash in a public space where it is allowed.\n\nIf your neighbour chooses to drive their kid to school each day rather than exposing their kid to dogs and seeking help to overcome that fear, then it's their choice. There are dogs everywhere, so it's not possible to shelter the child from all dogs in the world. What are they gonna do? Ask all dog owners to stay away from their child?

Yes of course you have a right to walk your dog down a public street, but it has a much bigger negative impact on her family than it has a positive impact on yours.

This seems like a reasonable ask that they don't hang out at the bus stop also. It may be inconvenient for you to not be able to walk the dog, but it doesn't make you fearful.\n\nYou could also offer to get the child used to the dog, but understand that children with autism are very easily overwhelmed and a big goofy puppy is a bit overwhelming.\n\nTldr: the kid has a disability, accommodate it", "YTA, for all the reasons everyone else said\u2026AND it\u2019s a puppy NOW.

Neighbor lives 3 houses from me across the street, thats the direction of the bus stop. We\u2019re friends, hangout at times and gotten along since. Neighbors child that goes on same bus is autistic, and terrified of dogs. Has never been attacked, he just cant handle it.\n\nWe have a cute st bernard puppy, big goof, trips on his own paws, far from threatening. When I say this child could run a sub 5 second 40, I say this because I saw it. My dog hasnt even barked once. Theres no reason this makes sense, but I understand and appreciate the situation. I have friends that are in the same.\n\nMy neighbor asked me to not walk my dog to the bus stop anymore because 1) it scares her child and 2) they have to drive him to school. \n\nI had her repeat it just to make sure I heard right. Then I replied no. She was shocked and asked why. I said its unreasonable. Next thing is I cant walk down that way at all, or if her child wants to go up the street I have to put my dog in the house? Would you ask someone at the park with their dog to kindly leave because her child doesnt like dogs?\n\nNeedless to say, I dont think we\u2019ll be invited for their cookouts anymore.\n\nSo?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A real friend would understand the unique circumstances of a bus stop, a St. Bernard, and an autistic child who is terrified of dogs.  Nothing about this simple request means you can\u2019t walk the dog at other times.  Maybe try a little empathy and compassion.", "Wtf is up with people. It\u2019s a public sidewalk, public bus stop and you can\u2019t control the world around you by asking other people to adjust. \n\nI would\u2019ve said no too. This child will certainly run into dogs throughout his life, what they should do is practice being around one with a person they know in a controlled environment", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re being asked to make a small, reasonable accommodation concerning your actions in a public space for a child with a known issue they cannot help.\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to do it, but you\u2019re certainly an asshole for not doing so.", "YTA. It's a really simple request. The dog doesn't need to be at the bus stop, but their kid does.", "Could the neighbor just walk both children to the bus stop while you walk the dog before or after?", "YTA, and I say this as a dog owner. Your puppy suffers no harm by staying home while you walk your kid to the bus stop.", "YTA, I understand you completely, and I get how you feel. But your choice in this matter makes you an AH, simply because it's such a small request and your cute pup wouldn't even care if he can't walk to the bus stop and back.", "Yta. She made a reasonable request. You can walk your puppy literally any other time of the day.", "YTA - especially for your what if arguments \u2026 but if that is a place the child needs to be, you should respect that.\n\nHow would you feel on the other side of that?", "YTA. \n\nThe argument that \"what will they ask next\" is such a BS way to avoid being kind and considerate. These people have never done anything bad to you, and they have a situation out of their control that I think many people would understand could happen to anyone (aka, anyone who has a child could find themselves with a similar struggle). \n\nAnd they are NOT asking you to never walk your dog, they are asking you to not bring your dog to the bus stop, because it means their child cannot get on the bus. Sure, you can take the attitude that it isn't your problem, but is that the person you want to be in the world? \n\nYou can walk your dog any other time, and if they asked you not to, then you could say no. Saying yes to one request doesn't mean you have to say yes to everything else.  This is 5 minutes out of your day that you just have to not bring your dog, it has no other impact on you besides just not bringing him with you to the bus stop, whereas bringing him has a  big impact on this child and his parents, who have done nothing wrong to you. \n\nIf you fall on the sidewalk and hurt yourself, do you want people to walk by you and say \"not my problem\" or do you want them to stop, even if they have somewhere to be, to help you? This is a question of who you want to be in this world, someone who always puts yourself first, no matter what, or do you want to be flexible and compassionate to those around you?", "YTA\n\nUnless it's pre-k, your kids can probably walk themselves and they weren't saying don't walk the dog, just please don't walk the dog where their kid can't avoid it. People talk about wanting community and good relationships with neighbors but don't want to do anything that's actually neighborly.", "Yes YTA a child\u2019s feeling is more important than a dog. Walk the dog some other time", "YTA here. Listen...you don't HAVE to leave your dog at home. You can walk your dog back and forth five minutes to the bus stop every morning if you want to, regardless of who is inconvenienced by it and even if they ask you not to. But by doing so you consciously and openly admit that you do not care that it just makes life more difficult very first thing in the morning for literally everyone involved. For a five minute little walk for your large dog that is absolutely and definitely a breed that needs to go out for BIG walks later in the day anyway.\n\nDo you at least make an effort to stand back and keep your dog away from this poor kid? I love St Bernards, I think they're adorable and I love them for how big and clumsy they are. But you have to acknowledge that if a literal child is scared the human thing to do would be to make even the slightest effort to make sure your dog isn't close and terrifying them.", "NTA. We live in a world where everyone expects constant accommodations regardless of the validity of the request. I have an autistic nephew, so I feel I'm not being biased when I say that she should not have asked you to accommodate him but should do whatever she can to comfort him while at the bus stop, assuring the child that the dog will not follow him to school. Maybe I'm TAH for saying so. I just feel that too often nowadays people expect others to be so accommodating! It frustrates me!", "YTA- that was not a big ask and it sounds like you care more about yourself in this situation. You have no idea how hard it it raising an autistic child. I have two m. I have encountered many people like you who think they know better, who think that they can teach my child to get over their problems by forcing them to face them. You are selfish. It should bother you that you are upsetting a child with an action that you could very easily avoid without any problems. Is is that you like the attention? It is that you think you know better than everyone else?\n\nNot cool. Mega YTA", "First of all, your slippery slope argument is unreasonable. She has not asked you any of these other things. She has only asked you to stop bringing your dog to the bus stop as both kids need to catch the bus there, and her kid is too scared to do so while your dog is there. You do not have to accommodate her, but do not judge a question based on whatever hypothetical thing she might ask for next. Assess it on its own merit. \n\nI'm going to say YTA. You are supposed to be friends, yet you show no empathy for her situation. The least you could have done was think along with her and come up with a solution that works for everyone.", "I know quite a few parents who walk their dog to school pickups and dropoffs. It's often the easiest time to walk their dog in a day with tight schedules.\nOP maybe don't walk your child all the way to the bus stop so the other kid doesn't have to be up close to the dog. Just walk to about 5 or 10 metres within the stop and wave you child off from there.\nThat way your dog gets walked and the other kid can learn to cope with this life hurdle in an easier setting.\nNTA", "YTA she's asking you to accommodate her child's needs at the bus stop. Where I live the bus stop is an extension of school property even tho it's on someone's driveways. You can't drink, smoke etc. If I was the parent I'd take this matter to school and let them deal with you.  She probably has a iep that entitles her to be accommodated.", "YTA I used to walk my dog to the bus stop too but if I knew a kid was fearful of him I\u2019d wait to take him out after the bus left. I don\u2019t care if the kid is autistic or not. Unbelievable how insensitive you are. She asked you kindly for a small thing and you stood your ground at the expense of a child\u2019s comfort and forced your neighbor to drive the kid to school. How do you not see this.", "YTA", "NAH / YTA \n\nYou\u2019re free to do whatever you want. However, hopefully you understand that you\u2019re choosing to create a situation that causes that child to start each school day terrified. Her request is not unreasonable. \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask you to do any of the other things you mentioned. Just asked that you don\u2019t bring your dog to bus stop. Also, ppl with children who are terrified of dogs don\u2019t bring them to a dog park. That\u2019s not even a realistic scenario. \n\nEta \u2014 also you clearly do not understand nor appreciate the situation... Or you just don\u2019t care about negatively affecting her child.", "YTA st bernards are huge and this is an excitable puppy, it's not gonna sit down calmly and wait for your kid to get on the bus before walking back with you. Look, i love dogs and my dog is my world but you are making this family's life more difficult by not leaving the dog at home for a later walk, the kid has a right to take the bus your dog will probably enjoy the walk more if you don't stop to wait for the bus every day.", "Is there a compromise here? I mean, I have autistic kids and pups so I can see there are needs for both, you want to socialise the pup and they want their kid to be comfortable.\n\nI know you can't change the world to suit one child but can you work it out between you, as friends? Be the bigger person and help each other? Maybe that way he can learn to become desensitized to dogs nearby and help you all in the long run.\n\nFrom experience I know these fears can be triggered by lack of control - he can't control how close the dog comes so he panics. If you had a deal whereby he knew you stayed a small distance off from the stop, he might find it ok, and you could even work on reducing that gradually. She isn't helping by trying to eliminate everything from his environment either.", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t like your other scenarios of \u201cnot walking the dog that way down the street\u201d or \u201casking someone to leave the park\u201d - in both of those cases your dog can be avoided. \n\nThis is a bus stop, a designated place for children to wait to catch the bus. The child can\u2019t walk to the other side of the street to avoid being around the dog, or stick to an area in the park where the dog isn\u2019t. You are actively and knowingly standing in a place where that child has to be with a thing that scares them for an extended period of time. That makes you an asshole\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to walk down the street with your dog, and to go to the park. But if you were doing one of those and saw a person who you knew was afraid of dogs would you deliberately walk right over to them and make them be around the dog? Or would you just coexist in that space at a distance where everyone gets to be comfortable", "YTA. Perfect time to put yourself in someone else's shoes. God forbid it was your child, would it be nice of your neighbor to not terrify him before school? Yes. Sounds like this poor kid has a hard time regardless - would not kill you at all to change your routine ever so slightly to be a good person.", "It's not that big of an ask, in my opinion.  This is why people hate dog owners.  You are not merely walking up the street.  You are waiting with a large dog with your children at a bus stop.  Those kids have to take the bus, you can walk your dog at any time.  Yta  They had to send out a letter because some entitled asshole brought their dog onto the school sidewalk.", "YTA. Your dog won't suffer from being inside for a few minutes, but this kid will be terrified with the dog. It's such a small and weird hill to die on. It's not inconveniencing you in the slightest, and it's a nice gesture to make sure a kid is comfortable. Also, your slippery slope fallacy is dumb. None of those other things are going to happen, and if they did then you can say no to those.", "> My neighbor asked me to not walk my dog to the bus stop anymore because 1) it scares her child and 2) they have to drive him to school. \n\n\nYTA - You are basically saying your right to walk your dog near the bus stop at a certain time is more important than another's child.", "YTA here. I don't think it is an unreasonable ask especially if you consider the person a friend. If you understood and appreciated the situation you would leave the pup at home for the few minutes it takes to get your child to the bus stop and on the bus.", "YTA: Why are you needlessly scaring a child?

Of course it\u2019s your \u201cright\u201d to bring your dog to the bus stop, but it\u2019s sad that you have so little empathy. That you feel that because you want to bring your dog, then it\u2019s okay that a kid starts their day off terrified and/or has to get driven to school every day. It\u2019s honestly sad and frustrating to read this. \n\n\u201cI asked her to repeat it just to make sure I heard right\u201d. \n\nThis sentence speaks volumes about you and makes me think I know exactly what kind of person you really are.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. the world has dogs, sheltering their child isn't helping. it is not your responsibility to tip toe around unreasonable fears. they can, and should, put him in counseling.", "YTA.

Standing at the bus stop is basically a daily social event that you all attend together, and she's telling you that your decision to bring your dog to this event is scaring her kid.\n\nI don't have any experience with kids with autism, but I know if either of my kids have a rough or stressful morning, it sets the tone for the whole day and it sucks, so I can imagine it's even worse for her.

Your slippery slope argument about \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d I think is a little over the top.  Her son has to stand in close proximity to the dog in order to catch his bus.

Morally, you are completely YTA.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter that you think your dog is great. That's super for you. He's scared of all dogs, not just yours.

I'm speaking of an actual puppy not a 18 month old \"puppy\".", "According to the American Psychological Association, some of the potential variations of exposure therapies include:\r  \n\r  \nIn vivo exposure. It involves facing your fear in real life. For example, someone with arachnophobia may interact with a spider.", "Nobody \"decided.\"\n\nThey asked.\n\nThey made a reasonable request. \n\nAnd OP considered that. And the very real motivation behind it, and said, \"No, fuck you, I'm doing what I want.\"\n\nThis isn't a legal issue. It's a \"should you have basic empathy and consideration for other humans\" issue. \n\nOP clearly does not and that's why she's the asshole here.", "It's a bus stop. For children. Not a dog park.\n\nNo one is telling OP to keep her dog locked in the house all day or that it can't walk through the neighborhood. That's all OP catastrophizing in her head. They simply requested that she not bring her dog to the bus stop (a place for children to board the bus for school in the morning) because it panics her child with special needs. Which is absolutely reasonable. The bus stop is not a place for dogs.", "Past, not to. Are you lingering at a kids\u2019 bus stop lurking? No. And they\u2019re not asking to stop walking the dog point blank. Just to consider not bringing it to linger at the bus stop. \n\nIt\u2019s OPs right to say no, but the kind thing in this specific situation is to leave the pup home.

Would you force your dog to interact with someone they are afraid of?", "I\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t hold opinions. Plenty of people hold antisocial opinions. But they\u2019re just that\u2014antisocial.", "Exactly, because it\u2019s easier to say that someone is T A than thinking that MAYBE the kid\u2019s parents should help him with his fears because dogs are very common in the world", "I\u2019m not speaking in absolutes, and I never claimed from the start that even if this persons niece was autistic that their autism is the same as OP\u2019s neighbor\u2019s child\u2019s autism. \n\nI\u2019m saying that it\u2019s false equivalency either way, yes, and that every person with ASD is a unique case.

This includes dogs and other animals, noises, people, cars... Now of course no two people are the same and they all have different triggers. But what's constant is getting triggered some way or another. You cannot avoid this fully, so you have to come up with ways to deal with it. That could mean taking more time to walk past the house with the dog or bringing your child by car. But what's once again constant is that you don't put it on the dog to not be there.", "Or you could grow up, and realize being kind and considerate to an autistic child is more important than walking your dog to that child\u2019s bus stop.", "The bus stop is not a service for the dog, it\u2019s a service for the children, and the dog\u2019s presence is making it inaccessible to one of them.", "The dog existing, and not even barking, is not preventing access."]}
