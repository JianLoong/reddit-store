He wanted everything he requested and not just one singular thing, and I foolishly obliged. I spent double what he spent and essentially left myself in debt for it. I held onto the gifts because I just didn\u2019t feel completely right about the situation and told him they were delayed in the post. \n\nHe invited me to a family event at the weekend and said it would be rude to show up empty handed. So I spent \u20ac70 on a gift for his niece, and decent wine with chocolates for his siblings. Turns out he was the one who invited me and not his family, and that there\u2019s actually no space for the two of us and he\u2019s too cheap to chip in for a hotel or B&B. I decided to stay at home and not go, but he expected me to give him the gifts I bought to bring from him. When I said no, he was actually taken back. \n\nToday I packaged his gifts and returned them, and I also returned what I could of the gifts I bought for his family.

You already know the answer and you\u2019ve already made up your mind about ending things with him. So why post it on Reddit, except for affirmation.\n\nBut to get back on topic - did you have a conversation with him about it? Just because he makes money doesn\u2019t mean his priority is to spend money. Maybe he just has never known the unspoken rules about couples travelling for one\u2019s family. \n\nSo did you have a conversation about if you were going to go, where were you going to stay? Did you say that your expectation in a relationship - when travelling at the other partners request, is that the other person covers the hotel or Airbnb? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My expectation of decency is that if my partner invited me to a long-distance wedding, they\u2019re covering airfare and we can split the hotel room. I\u2019m not staying on a couch. And any gifts for family with the exception of nominal gifts, like a bottle of wine or chocolate, are on my partner to pay for. When we\u2019re married, that\u2019s a different story because it\u2019s \u201cour money\u201d. \n\nI have a close friend (woman - Beth) who\u2019s dating another close friend of mine (man - Steve). She makes a very good salary and is older, about the same as your situation. Steve makes decent money, but he\u2019s younger and he\u2019s thrifty about his spending. Well, Steve invites Beth to a wedding some distance away. Beth agrees, and leaves it up to Steve to handle the planning. Steve books the flight and picks a budget airline with a connecting flight, making for a trip that\u2019s 2x as long as a direct flight. And it\u2019s to an airport that\u2019s still an hour from their destination. And he splits a hotel room with his sister and her husband. And then Steve sends a Venmo request (payment) for the flight and hotel. Beth is furious - she tells me all about it, but doesn\u2019t bring it up to him because she wants to see how he handles it. \n\nI had to explain to Beth - she\u2019s older, with money, and higher expectations. Steve is a man in his 20s and goes on vacations with 10 guys that share 5 bunk beds and couldn\u2019t be any happier about it. And Steve probably doesn\u2019t know that if he\u2019s taking his girlfriend to his family\u2019s wedding - he pays for it. So Beth needs to have a conversation explaining her expectations. \n\nIt came up again a few weeks ago with the same couple. They were going to one of his friend\u2019s housewarming, and that day, Beth asks \u201cSo what did you get them?\u201d Steve said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Steve is a man and culturally (here) a housewarming means beers, finger foods, and a tour of the house. What do you mean the expectation for women is to buy a gift? When I bought my house, the only gifts I received were from my female friends - blankets, a wine opener, wine glasses, and a cutting board. My male friends? Nothing except a few six packs and a bag of chips for the party! And of course I didn\u2019t expect anything - but that\u2019s because men\u2019s expectations may be very different from women\u2019s expectations.\n\nNow me and Steve are going to a wedding for another friend next month. The bougie wedding hotel costs $900 for the weekend. Instead, me and Steve are splitting a $150 room at a nearby dump with a bar and will be the happiest guests at the wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He had MANY, MANY flaws, and red flags, but his \"gifts\" were the icing on the cake. His family owns a multi-million dollar company on 2 different continents. He AND his family openly brag about their finances. Whereas our family is not wealthy. We aren't poor, but we aren't wealthy. My kids all worked thru college in order to graduate without debt. 2 years in a row, my daughters now ex-boyfriend would take her out to dinner for her birthday, as her gift. That was the extent of her gift. Now, this may all sound great, but.... they always had a deal where whoever paid the bill, the other person would pay the tip and parking if needed. So, the 1st year, he took her downtown for dinner. Parking was $20. The bill for the meal was $175 (no drinks, all food). My daughters food was $39. The tip she left was $40. So she spent $60 on her own birthday gift. His birthday rolls around, and he wants dinner and a gift. My daughter spent $50 on a gift, $125 on a meal (her food was $24). They go to leave, and the idiot tells my daughter he doesn't have cash for a tip. So my daughter left a $30 tip.\n\nThe next year, same garbage. He takes her out to eat for her birthday. The meal was $187. My daughters food was $47. Her idiot ex says to her, \"I only have $100 cash.\" So she paid $87 towards the bill AND a $42 tip. Now, I am fully aware that he has his own credit card with no limit. Both him and his parents have mentioned this several times over the years. My daughter was a bit upset on the way home from the restaurant because she really didn't budget $150 into her expenses and had to pick up extra shifts at work. She didn't say anything about it, but her ex kept asking why she was quiet and spending time on her phone (she was begging people to give up shifts so she could pick them up). So she told him she is kind of worried about how she is going to afford her parking permit at college that started the following week because she spent too much. Ex got mad, told her that he's not cheap, he took her to a nice place for dinner (she would have been happier at olive garden. He picked the places) and that she is ungrateful. She voiced that going forward, she wants to pay for her own meals, and he pays for his because she can't afford to eat out with him anymore, so she wants to get separate checks. Well, ex lost it. He broke up with her, dropped her off at home because he \"isn't cheap,\" and sent her a venmo request for the $100 he spent on dinner. Needless to say, he didn't get the additional $100.\n\nThe moral of the story is.... RUN OP!!!!! Don't waste 2 years of your life like my daughter did on an idiot who doesn't respect and  value you or put any effort into the relationship.
