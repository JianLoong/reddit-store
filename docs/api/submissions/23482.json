You're 14 working at a restaurant ?\n\nNone of this is normal. Your money should be your own and probably saved in an account for when you're 18.   \nYou need to get out of this situation as soon as you can, your mother is using you and probably plans to have you be her caretaker later on.", "NTA. you\u2019re 14, you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for paying your rent and your mother should be taking care of this and of you. She shouldn\u2019t be taking money that you have earned. Spend your money on what you want, none of this should be your responsibility. Does your mother have a job??", "NTA - you're 14 - you are not responsible for paying your mom's rent or providing her with money. \n\nI'm sorry to be blunt but as a mandated reporter, you're being abused financially. Do you have anyone in your school that you could talk to about this situation because someone who is able to help you needs to know about this, sweetie. \n\nPlease get help. This isn't a question of who's the AH on Reddit - it's a situation where you need some help and support to get out of it.", "NTA. Your mum should be responsible for you not the other way round.", "NTA your mother\u2019s job is to take care of you not the other way around. PERIOD.", "NTA this is very sad. At 14 you do not need the stress of paying rent and supporting your mother and she is 100% not entitled to your money. Unfortunately because you are young, you have limited options so I would just save as much as you can without your mother knowing until you can find other living arrangements.", "You are being your mother's mother.  Is there any family member you can move to, so you can be the child you are?", "NTA, this is abuse.", "NTA- sometimes we get used to a situation, even though it isn\u2019t right. You cussing your mom when you aren\u2019t feeling well and she is telling you that you still have to go to work tells me just how badly you were feeling. Hopefully your mom realizes this.\n\nAs to whether or not this is financial abuse, if you are working enough at 14 to earn as much as you do because you want to, then it is OK. If you are voluntarily giving your mom money to help the household out, then that is OK. What is difficult here is just how much is you doing it voluntarily and how much is because of pressure from your mother to be basically an adult at 14 when other kids are out having fun. \n\nI worked in mental health and the amount of abuse that people put up with growing up because their abusers were their parents is mind boggling. Just because she is your mother does not mean that what she is doing is normal and not abusive. One big red flag is the $75 per week for your bed or you don\u2019t have a place to sleep. That is $3,900 per year and $15,600 for over the next 4 years until you are 18. Parents are supposed to take care of their children. That means food clothing and shelter (including a bed).

Make sure you put a big chunk of your pay away where she does not have access.  If you get direct deposit split the deposit so half goes to a savings account that she is not aware of.  If you are getting checks split the money and put half in a savings account.  Since you are under 18 she must be on your checking but I do not think she has to cosign a savings account.

You shouldn\u2019t be doing all this", "NTA, but your mother seems like a gigantic one. You're being financially abused. \n\nWhat is your mother buying with this money you're throwing at her? With her rent paid, disability benefits, a side-gig house cleaning (that I guarantee she gets cash for and doesn't report), and getting money from your adult siblings, she is plenty flush. Why does she need your money? You're barely old enough to go to work!\n\nSide note, some financial advice since you are young and your mother can't be trusted to guide you on these matters: You're renting a bed for $75 a week? That's $300 dollars a month. How long is the term of this rental agreement? You could have a decent mattress and box spring for right around $300. And if you needed a bed but couldn't swing the full amount right off, you buy an $80 dollar twin mattress at Walmart, sleep on the floor on that for a month while you save for the one you want. Then get the mattress and box spring and start saving for a bed frame.", "NTA.  Start hiding your money.", "NTA. And depending on the state you live in, this is legally considered abuse.", "NTA, OP.\n\n>so i offer to give her some money here and there to help her out. I think in a month span, ive gave her over $300. \n\nYou are beyond generous to do this at your age. If she isn't satisfied with the amount, then stop giving her money. You aren't a cashcow, OP.\n\n>We recently got in an argument because i wanted to skip work because i was sick and she said i would get fired. I confronted her and assumed she really cared more about the money. She agreed and i got pissed off.\n\nYou are supposed to be a child, not your mother's caretaker. If you're sick you shouldn't have to work, and you have all the right to be angry with your mother for her response.\n\n>She threatened to send my bed back (I pay $75 for it every week)\n\nShe cannot just do something like this. It's been bought by you, so if she threatens you with this again, simply warn her you'll call the cops on her. Your mother is the AH and sucks as a parent.", "NTA and get out as soon as you can", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you and not being a good parent. She should be supporting you and caring for your health and education, not threatening to take away your bed. \n\nYou have every right to be angry and stand up for yourself. You need to get help from someone you trust, like a relative, a teacher, or a counselor. \n\nThis is not a healthy situation for you.", "NTA, it's like you're your mother's mother which feels wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, this is not what a mother is supposed to do. 300$ is a lot at your age. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry or chip in at this age at all. \n\nThis is abuse. If you can, start looking into alternative places to stay. A family member? I know it\u2019s hard to do at 14, but she will not change her ways. My stepbrother is 32 and his mother would still be doing this if he hadn\u2019t cut her out of his life.", "NTA but you have way bigger problems and issues because she\u2019s financially and mentally abusing you. You\u2019re anxiety must be through the roof and at your age you don\u2019t deserve to have to deal with that.", "NTA if you can get her to discuss finances with you, do it.

You are 14, what country do you live in? Depending on where you are you may be able to get support from the government or local authority but it seems odd that you have become responsible for paying into the household at this very young age. At 14 you are still a child and you should be focusing on your studies - I realise my view is biased because of how things are where I am from.", "NTA. She is the parent. It is literally her job to take care of you, not the other way around. It sounds like she might be financially abusing you. Are you able to talk to your school counsellor or a trusted teacher?", "Oh, buddy. You shouldn't have to worry about this stuff at your age. Your mother should be able to support the household without pressuring you for money.", "CPS?", "NTA. I was in a similar situation as you. \n\nI'll play devil's advocate and say that you don't need to cut your mother off completely. It's not good to rely on a teenager for money, but unfortunately, in impoverished families, everyone ends up contributing\n\nIf I were you I would sit your mother down and say you don't mind contributing here and there, but there are limits and you are not going to work when you're sick under any circumstances, etc\n\nYou seem like a good kid.
