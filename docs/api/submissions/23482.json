You're 14 working at a restaurant ?\n\nNone of this is normal. Your money should be your own and probably saved in an account for when you're 18.   \nYou need to get out of this situation as soon as you can, your mother is using you and probably plans to have you be her caretaker later on.", "NTA. you\u2019re 14, you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for paying your rent and your mother should be taking care of this and of you. She shouldn\u2019t be taking money that you have earned. Spend your money on what you want, none of this should be your responsibility. Does your mother have a job??", "NTA - you're 14 - you are not responsible for paying your mom's rent or providing her with money. \n\nI'm sorry to be blunt but as a mandated reporter, you're being abused financially. Do you have anyone in your school that you could talk to about this situation because someone who is able to help you needs to know about this, sweetie. \n\nPlease get help. This isn't a question of who's the AH on Reddit - it's a situation where you need some help and support to get out of it.", "NTA. Your mum should be responsible for you not the other way round.", "NTA your mother\u2019s job is to take care of you not the other way around. PERIOD.", "NTA this is very sad. At 14 you do not need the stress of paying rent and supporting your mother and she is 100% not entitled to your money. Unfortunately because you are young, you have limited options so I would just save as much as you can without your mother knowing until you can find other living arrangements.", "You are being your mother's mother.  Is there any family member you can move to, so you can be the child you are?", "NTA, this is abuse.", "NTA- sometimes we get used to a situation, even though it isn\u2019t right. You cussing your mom when you aren\u2019t feeling well and she is telling you that you still have to go to work tells me just how badly you were feeling. Hopefully your mom realizes this.\n\nAs to whether or not this is financial abuse, if you are working enough at 14 to earn as much as you do because you want to, then it is OK. If you are voluntarily giving your mom money to help the household out, then that is OK. What is difficult here is just how much is you doing it voluntarily and how much is because of pressure from your mother to be basically an adult at 14 when other kids are out having fun. \n\nI worked in mental health and the amount of abuse that people put up with growing up because their abusers were their parents is mind boggling. Just because she is your mother does not mean that what she is doing is normal and not abusive. One big red flag is the $75 per week for your bed or you don\u2019t have a place to sleep. That is $3,900 per year and $15,600 for over the next 4 years until you are 18. Parents are supposed to take care of their children. That means food clothing and shelter (including a bed).

Make sure you put a big chunk of your pay away where she does not have access.  If you get direct deposit split the deposit so half goes to a savings account that she is not aware of.  If you are getting checks split the money and put half in a savings account.  Since you are under 18 she must be on your checking but I do not think she has to cosign a savings account.

You shouldn\u2019t be doing all this", "NTA, but your mother seems like a gigantic one. You're being financially abused. \n\nWhat is your mother buying with this money you're throwing at her? With her rent paid, disability benefits, a side-gig house cleaning (that I guarantee she gets cash for and doesn't report), and getting money from your adult siblings, she is plenty flush. Why does she need your money? You're barely old enough to go to work!\n\nSide note, some financial advice since you are young and your mother can't be trusted to guide you on these matters: You're renting a bed for $75 a week? That's $300 dollars a month. How long is the term of this rental agreement? You could have a decent mattress and box spring for right around $300. And if you needed a bed but couldn't swing the full amount right off, you buy an $80 dollar twin mattress at Walmart, sleep on the floor on that for a month while you save for the one you want. Then get the mattress and box spring and start saving for a bed frame.", "NTA.  Start hiding your money.", "NTA. And depending on the state you live in, this is legally considered abuse.", "NTA, OP.\n\n>so i offer to give her some money here and there to help her out.

You aren't a cashcow, OP.\n\n>We recently got in an argument because i wanted to skip work because i was sick and she said i would get fired.

Your mother is the AH and sucks as a parent.", "NTA and get out as soon as you can", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you and not being a good parent. She should be supporting you and caring for your health and education, not threatening to take away your bed. \n\nYou have every right to be angry and stand up for yourself.

I\u2019m sorry, this is not what a mother is supposed to do. 300$ is a lot at your age. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry or chip in at this age at all. \n\nThis is abuse. If you can, start looking into alternative places to stay. A family member? I know it\u2019s hard to do at 14, but she will not change her ways. My stepbrother is 32 and his mother would still be doing this if he hadn\u2019t cut her out of his life.", "NTA but you have way bigger problems and issues because she\u2019s financially and mentally abusing you. You\u2019re anxiety must be through the roof and at your age you don\u2019t deserve to have to deal with that.", "NTA if you can get her to discuss finances with you, do it.

You are 14, what country do you live in? Depending on where you are you may be able to get support from the government or local authority but it seems odd that you have become responsible for paying into the household at this very young age. At 14 you are still a child and you should be focusing on your studies - I realise my view is biased because of how things are where I am from.", "NTA. She is the parent. It is literally her job to take care of you, not the other way around. It sounds like she might be financially abusing you. Are you able to talk to your school counsellor or a trusted teacher?", "Oh, buddy. You shouldn't have to worry about this stuff at your age. Your mother should be able to support the household without pressuring you for money.", "CPS?", "NTA. I was in a similar situation as you. \n\nI'll play devil's advocate and say that you don't need to cut your mother off completely. It's not good to rely on a teenager for money, but unfortunately, in impoverished families, everyone ends up contributing\n\nIf I were you I would sit your mother down and say you don't mind contributing here and there, but there are limits and you are not going to work when you're sick under any circumstances, etc\n\nYou seem like a good kid.

I have sadly seen it happen to my friends as teenagers, and my younger sisters friends. Parents should not rely on the money of their child for rent and necessities. It is not right to make your 14 yr old worry about these things. Many states won\u2019t even allow you to work until 15 with some sort of permit and 16 without the permit.", "honey, you need to be saving your money for your education, future home, vehicles, etc... please know this is not normal or ok", "I completely understand what you're saying. But this is why I'm suggesting you go and speak to a trusted adult. \n\nThis IS bad. And it's not 'probably only financially ' - that's still a very valid and very real form of abuse. \n\nI know that what I'm saying is not nice to hear, especially at your age, but that is why I'm saying it, because at 14 you're not supposed to be able to identify what is abusive behavior and what isn't.  \n\nHowever, my profession and the fact I am a mandated reporter as a result does allow me to tell you that it is. \n\nThis said, I am just someone anonymous online, which is why I am trying to direct you to a trusted adult, hopefully in your school, who is able to support you - it's very very important that you do this.", "At 14, I\u2019m going to assume you haven\u2019t been working for longer than a year? And already your mom has asked you to not only give her $$ and pay for your bed, but also to pay rent for at least one month. Her request/demand for your financial contribution will only increase, not decrease. The same goes for her paying you back, which it sounds like this hasn\u2019t been happening as often as when she first started asking for money. \n\nIt\u2019s not right that she puts this financial expectation on you. I can understand wanting to help your mom, but she\u2019s become manipulative and my guess is she feels justified in taking your money - for which she is NOT.", "Maybe try online banks like chime or even Cashapp has a cash card and does direct deposit", "See if you can move in with your brother or your grandparents.  You're too young to be this jaded,child. YOU'RE A CHILD. Shit call cps on your mum yourself, you'll be better off with other family.", "Still you are just 14. You need some adult person\u2019s help. The more money you will make, your mom will simply take it away from you. She won\u2019t let you be financially independent.", "Spoken like one and one who can't even distinguish the education of what ASAP means from what advice is.", "id probably go to my siblings, most likely my brother if anything. and my sister in law. my sister in law works with me and agrees with me.", "only been working basically for the summer, plus the weekends when i had school", "i doubt that, not to be rude.. but i dont think another family could help me either. it scares me quite frankly", "Sure, haha.", "But you know what, let me explain to you how the world works because you clearly don't.\n\nEvery teen every who clings to the idea of \"Just escape at 18!\" is so blissfully ignorant of what it truly means to live on their own. It's about as useful advice as \"Have you thought about not being sad?\" to someone with depression.\n\nIf fleeing an abusive household was easy, more people would do it. But apparently the cost of living, rent, and all other life expenses that it costs to support oneself is unknown to you. Sure, OP could \"escape\" to college, only to find themselves stuck with thousands of dollars of debt, especially if they switch career paths. \n\nOP could find roommates, which some people are absolutely not okay living with strangers, and I don't blame those people. OP might have friends but banking on that isn't necessarily a realistic option either. OP could find a room for rent but again, those scenarios are not without their risks. OP might have family who could help, but we don't know this.\n\nIf OP lives in a HCOL area rent is not just unreasonable, it's almost impossible for some people to be able to support themselves. The likelihood of OP finding a job at 18 that will pay enough is also an unreasonable expectation; most likely OP would have to work 2 jobs and that's a lot of stress. If their job offers health insurance that's more cost OP would have to consider.\n\nThen there's transportation; if OP isn't living in an area with easy public transportation there's the notion that OP will need to buy a car, have car insurance, will have to pay for gas, and consider cost of maintaining said car.\n\nWe haven't even touched on food, toiletries, utilities, and everything else. \n\nComing from someone who actually lived on their own, worked 2 jobs, and barely stayed afloat.", "Could you do that do you think?   How old are your brother and sister in law?\n\nI think it's really important that you do speak to them.", "It SHOULD scare you (you're not being rude, we're having a conversation!  :)  )\n\nAre there severe cons to CPS? Yes,  but if they elect to let you stay, they can help. There are programs that help single outstretched parents with rent, food, etc. I get is summer, but what happens when school rolls around again? And you should be SAVING your money. Not giving out to your mum, who clearly is abusing your kindness, and you. \n\nYou may not see it as abusive. You're 14. I don't blame you for that because 1) you haven't got a lot of love experience and 2) frankly you've almost got too much for your age at this point. You're a KID. It's not YOUR JOB to support your mum, it's HER JOB to support you. \n\nI am not saying your mum is evil. Not at all.  She may not even realize what she is doing is abuse. But here is a whole lot of internet people willing to give advice/ find a solution(s). \n\nBut picking up more hours is not the answer.  Look into becoming an emancipated minor. Make sure you at LEAST finish high school. Please. \n\nYou are not responsible for your mum's emotions or reactions. \nYou are NOT responsible for your mum's wellbeing. \nYou are NOT responsible for rent, for food, etc.", "Look into emancipation. You won't have to live with any of your family members although you will be responsible for yourself. Since you already earn enough to pay rent on a place plus more, you should have a better case for it.", "29 for my sister in law, and then 32 for my brother (atleast i think lol)", "i plan on finishing high school and then moving out. i dont mind helping my mom its just out of hand rn. but i do like my family and id like to stay with them. if anything its only my mother with that problem.", "I think if you could speak to them, and tell them absolutely everything that has been happening (please don't miss anything out, even if you don't think it's important) then I think this would be a really good thing for you to do. \n\nYou're 14 and you're not supposed to be dealing with something like this alone. \n\nPlease don't think that I am telling you your mom is a bad person - I do not know her, I don't know anything about your situation other than what you've said.  I do know that her behavior in this situation is abusive, whether she is intending to be or not.   \n\nYou do need help with this and I really hope that your brother and sister in law can support you, and indeed support your mom to sort her own finances out because realistically this is what needs to happen rather than her putting all that pressure on you. \n\nGood luck, and I hope that your family can work this out", "Definitely look into assistance programs then for rent and for food. Look into therapy programs for yourself- it will help immensely with stress. Talk to counselors at your shop that you trust about what you can currently apply for too in terms of assistance. It's not time to be prideful- it's about survival. \n\nBust your butt in school and apply for all the scholarships you can. Don't do what I did which was work the whole time and avoid schoolwork. I'm now 34 with no degree and it's seriously hurt my prospects, despite having 15+years of management experience. Get to college. You CAN break out of the poverty your experiencing and make a better life for yourself, even for your mum if you wish it.  It will be hard. Like really fucking hard.  But you can do it. \n\nAlso- people are reacting so strongly here because of your age, and what you've described.  I hope it doesn't turn you away from Reddit in the future.  Most people in here are genuine and want to help. \n\nIf you ever need to vent, please feel free to pm me. \n\nDon't give up hope.  Don't give in to the stress. You're also not supposed to go into work sick, and be aware of labor laws. As a minor, those will be your best friend and worst nightmare (limits hours you can work but helps against pay discrimination and exploitation).", "thank you, i appreciate that. im gonna just get an education and figure things out on my own. even if i shouldn\u2019t, i think im doing pretty good indefinitely, and id like to be independent. its just how i can focus on myself. but thank you", "i think im pretty independent. i do good on my own, even for my age. but im going to get an education and enough money to provide for myself. i cant cut my mother out, and i doubt she will do this when i have school. i wont make nearly as much and she knows i have to buy stuff for school, and my bed. i feel bad, i guess thats the point of AITA, but i dont like some of the things people are saying about my mother, that are off topic from this situation.", "NTA. Your mom is mean and a user. She asks all of her kids for money. Can you go live with an older sibling? Do what you can to protect your money. Open a bank account. Find and protect your documents (birth certificate, SSN, etc). Good luck.", "oh my gosh babe you sound like such an awesome kid. What your mother is doing is 100% not okay. I know in some poverty situations kids unfortunately do work and help out financially and I'm trying to he cognizant of that BUT your mothers behavior is 100% not okay... she needs to pick up the slack and find work instead of burdening a literal CHILD with her financial problems and manipulating her kids into supporting her. youre still in school kiddo and you're working which is a huge thing and I'm proud of you but housing, and meeting your basic needs (like your bed) are your mothers responsibility.", "NTA OMG\u2026 you are 14, you are the child, you are the one who should be taken care of.  None of what is happening is okay.  This is abuse.  It is kind of you to offer to help, but no, do not.  Your money is your own.\n\nDo you have other family or friends that would allow you stay with them?  If not talk to your school counselor or a trusted teacher and they can help.", "My mother did something very similar to me when I was your age. She was taking my money and using it for drugs for herself and my brother. I cut her off the moment I had an out. Your mom is toxic- she is YOUR mother and should be caring for YOU. You are a child and should be focusing on school and any work you\u2019re doing on the side should be money for YOU. Do you have any family you can go to?", "Echoing this, please tell us you have people that can help you????\n\nI'm seriously worried about you, metalupyourass777.", "Why isn't this top comment?", "thanks! maybe, if it comes to that. she provides me with food and every basic need, i just pay for my own bed. it was my decision but other than that yk.", "How is she retired at 57 and is broke? You don\u2019t retire if you\u2019re broke. That\u2019s not how retiring works.", "I don't know but I don't think it matters where the comment is - OP has engaged with me, and they may speak to their brother and sister in law.  To be totally honest I don't think they will, but, theyve seen and responded so I don't think that we can do much more. \n\nI sincerely hope that they do engage with a trusted adult somewhere as it's a very sad situation.", "That is child abuse and if she throws you out call the authorities. Record all of your interactions with her.", "I understand,  but you aren't in the best spot. As a child you don't have to pay for your own bed. But for now on, tell your mom that you will help her out, but 100% of what you give her gets subtracted from the bed bill. \n\nIf you loan her $300, then $300 is taken off the bed cost. Tell her it is that or you will just flat out quit.\n\nIf she threatens your bed, call habitat for humanity and get a cheap one.", "You are 14. You should not be paying your own bed. Or giving your mother money. It's her job to pay the bed and to give you money. Knowing where your docs are is just good planning. Better to be proactive than reactive. Good luck.", "i couldnt tell you. idk \u2639\ufe0f", "I'm near tears reading this.  I think it's one of the worst aita I've come across.  Poor kid deserves better", "shes disabled. she really cant, or else she would.", "she does not work. she barely gets any money though, and it goes to the bills she CAN pay.", "I hate to ask but what country are you in?  Because at least for someone in the US a lot of this would be considered abuse/neglect.", "I know.  I really know.", "It's never anything bad.  She only yells when I do, so it's my fault.  These are TEXTBOOK abuse victim responses.  You NEED to talk to someone at school, at a doctor's office, somewhere.  This is not right, this is abuse (not just financial abuse, but that doesn't matter abuse is abuse). You don't deserve this!", "You are in a very difficult and unfortunate situation. You are too young to be dealing with this much responsibility. Is there someone at school you can reach out to? You need some professional guidance on how to manage this situation. Good lick to you.", "TL:DR\n\nAll of it is accounted for in the word \"possible\"  As soon as possible or rephrased as soon as when possible.  All the ifs, buts, coulds, shoulds, woulds etc. all are in the \"when possible\" phrase...some people get caught up in what you listed and then some and the few who navitage through life with much more ease and much less drama look at what is possible and keep changing that to get what they want", "I can tell you love your mom. You have proven that with everything you are doing, but what she is doing is at least exploitative, if not actual abuse. What is she spending her disability on if not the rent? What did she need the $300 for? Does she get other financial assistance (food, utility help)? There are likely organizations who can help her to get on more stable ground so she does not have to rely on you/your income for necessities."]}
