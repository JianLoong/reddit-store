My kids usually come with me for the park nearby. My son (8) brought his own money to be able to buy some \u201ccool stuff\u201d but couldn\u2019t find anything he wanted except a snowball from the shop next door. \n\nI let him go by himself, I literally had eyes on him the whole time, and he spent his own money to buy himself and his sister a snowball. He used his $50, and came back with $35 change. I asked if he got a receipt, and said there was no way two kiddie size snowballs cost $15. \n\nSo after my market I walked into the shop with him, and asked if he could get his correct change. I could clearly see where kiddie sizes were $2.50, no tax, and said they owed him $10. The girl behind the counter had a horrible attitude about it and said there\u2019s no way she miscounted, but I said he very clearly now only has $35 in his wallet and he said he put it right into his wallet as soon as she gave it to him. \n\nThe owner came out from the back, looked around on their system some and checked the drawer, and she did absolutely count wrong, because he said they were off by $10. So the girl took out a $10 bill and slapped it on the counter. I just said thanks and walked out, and on the way home explained to my son why getting a receipt is important in the future and to always count change. \n\nI feel like I was in the right here, they gave out incorrect change, and I absolutely was NOT rude, I just asked for his change. But my husband made a comment as I was headed to my market this morning to \u201cnot cost someone their job over change\u201d.

I guarantee you he's not the first person she's done this to.  He's a kid so she figured he'd be an easy target.  I bet that at the end of the day, when the till was $10 over, that $10 would have ended up in her pocket.  Her attitude gives her away.  She knew from the start what she'd done.  Otherwise, she would have asked the manager to check the tape and the till and apologized.  Instead, she hoped that snarling at you would make you back down.  I've made mistakes counting change before.  When they were pointed out to me, I apologized and provided the correct change.  The only coworker I saw react the way that clerk did is the one who got fired and charged with theft a few weeks later when the tape showed her short-changing several customers, then taking the overage from the till and pocketing it at the end of the day.\n\nIf she did get fired, it was her own fault.  If she didn't get fired, the shop owner will be keeping a close eye on her because if word gets around that his employee rips off little kids, his business will suffer.\n\nYou taught your son a very important financial lesson.  Why should he have been cheated out of $10 just for the sake of keeping her employed.", "NTA.   It was $10.  And no, they don\u2019t teach kids to count change any more.

Can they not do the most basic of tasks for a cashier?   They'll assuredly be reprimanded for having a drawer thats over because the manager will know they fucked something up, either fucking the business over or fucking a customer over.\n\nOr the worst outcome:  They won't submit an over drawer because they're keeping track of what they short people and they pocket it.  Stealing.", "NTA\nThank you for doing the right thing and sticking up for your son. The cashier should be fired for her baditude alone, regardless if she shortchanged your son or not.
