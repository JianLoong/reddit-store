It happened a few weeks ago, but my husband made a comment this morning and now I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should have just let it go. \n\nI go to markets every Saturday for my business. My kids usually come with me for the park nearby. My son (8) brought his own money to be able to buy some \u201ccool stuff\u201d but couldn\u2019t find anything he wanted except a snowball from the shop next door. \n\nI let him go by himself, I literally had eyes on him the whole time, and he spent his own money to buy himself and his sister a snowball. He used his $50, and came back with $35 change. I asked if he got a receipt, and said there was no way two kiddie size snowballs cost $15. \n\nSo after my market I walked into the shop with him, and asked if he could get his correct change. I could clearly see where kiddie sizes were $2.50, no tax, and said they owed him $10. The girl behind the counter had a horrible attitude about it and said there\u2019s no way she miscounted, but I said he very clearly now only has $35 in his wallet and he said he put it right into his wallet as soon as she gave it to him. \n\nThe owner came out from the back, looked around on their system some and checked the drawer, and she did absolutely count wrong, because he said they were off by $10. So the girl took out a $10 bill and slapped it on the counter. I just said thanks and walked out, and on the way home explained to my son why getting a receipt is important in the future and to always count change. \n\nI feel like I was in the right here, they gave out incorrect change, and I absolutely was NOT rude, I just asked for his change. But my husband made a comment as I was headed to my market this morning to \u201cnot cost someone their job over change\u201d. I know he meant it as a joke, and to my knowledge it didn\u2019t cost her her job, I mean, idk if it\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t often, but it seemed a mistake.

If it was just a few cents, I would have said that it might be better to just let it slide, but ten dollars is a lot of money, especially for an eight-year-old.

Your husband\u2019s comment was disrespectful", "NTA I am astounded at how hard some people find counting change. I usually pay with cash and only use my credit card for large purchases. I was at the store the other day and the cashier, who clearly has used a debit or credit card her entire life, stumbled when I gave her exact change and she thought a quarter was a nickel.", "Nta. If that ended up costing her the job that's her own fault. She made a mistake, tried to cover, and was rude when caught. You did the right thing and it was a teachable moment for your son", "NTA.\n\nSince you were not rude, all you did was believe what your son told you, and stand up for him. \n\nIt is invaluable to your son's safety and overall well-being that he knows his mom believes him when he tells her someone has done something wrong to him. It's great he could get proof of that from an incident that wasn't traumatic.\n\nAs a mother, your job is to protect your child, you did so, without mistreating another person. Good job, mama.", "Nta. A mistake was made and corrected. Her attitude while unfortunate, does not change the fact that she made a mistake. Sounds like your husband was just kidding around.

And you probably taught your son a valuable lesson there.", "NTA.\nWhat you did was perfect. It is extremely good of you to make your kid handle money and interacting with sellers at this age.

An 8 year old with a 50$ bill is a good prey!\n2- Could it be that you were feeling a bit guilty inside and made a big deal out of your husband innocent joke? (You know him better, but I am the kind of person who tend to make similar jokes/teasing)", "NTA As a former cashier I made a lot of mistakes and corrected it. It goes with the job and it doesn't mean you get fired for it. A lot of times my managers never said anything to me about it. While it's our job to make sure you get the correct change back it's also your job to make sure of that. It's your money after all.", "NTA", "I\u2019d assume that snotty girl saw your young son as an easy target and was absolutely going to pocket the difference and got caught.\n\nWith something so cheap, how does that big of a mistake even happen??\n\nShe would be costing herself her job if anything. You should explain this to your husband.", "NTA The girl made a mistake. I hope. Anyone can make an honest mistake. I am not understanding cashier having an attitude ( and I am very  pro customer service worker), when she was mistaken.", "Nta. \u00a310 is not just a bit of change given theres a big difference.", "NTA. It may have been an honest mistake but it still needs to be corrected.", "NTA, but I probably wouldn't be comfortable with my young child walking around with $50. I get that it's his own money, but maybe break it up into smaller bills for him and if he wants a snowball, then give him $10.\n\nI've had money stolen from me as a kid from \"friends\" and I've lost money that fell out of pockets, and kids get taken advantage of by shady cashiers too. I've also worked retail way too long and have seen my share of cashiers come up with schemes to slip cash from the registers into their own pocket.", "Absolutely  NTA. Mistakes happen. The clerk was in the wrong. She should have immediately  call the owner to count the drawer instead of copping an attitude.", "NTA, $10 isn't exactly pocket change. It doesn't seem like she stole the extra money, she's just bad a math. Hopefully she'll approach her job with a humbler mentality in the future", "NTA you wouldn\u2019t have cost anyone their job, *their* actions and attempt at stealing from a child would\u2019ve done that.", "NTA. I\u2019m so tired of the culture we\u2019ve created where it you correct an employee you\u2019re suddenly a \u201cKaren\u201d and you\u2019re costing them their job. I understand people are paid dirt wages and customers are often abusive. But that doesn\u2019t mean every employee gets to automatically act like a customer is lying and being abusive. \n\nThem being bad at their job and having an attitude is what costs them their job. She didn\u2019t have to act like that towards you. Employees don\u2019t get to just talk to customers like that because they get paid like shit.

And he definitely was joking, but he\u2019s 100% non-confrontational (with everyone but me) and would die before calling someone out like that, and I\u2019m the opposite, I\u2019m never outright rude unless someone else starts that way, but I\u2019m gonna make sure my child\u2019s needs are met before I worry about someone else\u2019s feelings!", "Eh, sometimes he is, I feel like we all have our moments, but he\u2019s also super loving and gentle with me and our kids, so I can deal with a dig every now and then, and hand them right back too.", "I didn\u2019t get the feeling it was deliberate, but also, who knows! It\u2019s possible. Teenagers make silly decisions all the time. \nI did absolutely overthink the joke.

He got the bill for his birthday and has been saving it for something \u201cspecial\u201d because he thought it was so cool.

That\u2019s the definition of supervised.

Kids come first. Overthinkers unite! Lol", "I am glad you can look at things like this. I have intervened a few times asking people who were harsh with CS workers how they would feel if their grandkids were being treated as they were treating this person. It is hard for anyone to be called out on an error. Yes, it could get her in trouble, but having a drawer not add up would have caused her issues anyway.", "I don't think she made a mistake. She tried to run a scam on a kid.\n\nShe can math.

You are NTA.", "He was next door though. Clearly, your \"supervision\" here was completely ineffective. If you were watching him the whole time, then why didn't you just go with him? Was he the only one of your kids to come with you that day?", "Especially when snowballs are relatively cheap, $10 is a big margin of error when counting a drawer! I\u2019ve worked a register before, and it would be pretty normal to be off by some cents or even possible a dollar or two, but never was my drawer off by $10!", "Next door to my booth at an outdoor market. I was on the side, the snowball stand was 15 feet away. I didn\u2019t walk the 15 feet with him because I was selling at the market, I have a booth. It was him and his younger sister, they were together, and I could see them.", "It's an exact margin of error.\n\nIt's a crisp single bill to sneak out of the register and into her pocket at the end of the day.\n\nI gotta say \u2014 I'm amazed how much benefit of the doubt this teen cashier is getting in this thread!", "That is a lot of money. Absolutely."]}
