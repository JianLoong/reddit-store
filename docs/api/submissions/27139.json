Went to a prestigious school, profits off of his works, the whole shebang. I (28 F) have always considered myself a creative type, but always felt insecure of my talent or lack there of. He's always wanting to draw or paint or create with me, but I refuse due to this feeling of inferiority and slight embarrassment at our drastic difference in talent. That being said, it is something I'm trying to work through.\n\nThe other night we had gone out with some friends and ended up at our place staying up late and hanging out. One of my friends is also an artsy type, but has a lot more dedication and therefore talent in the arts than I do. On multiple occasions her and my partner gotten together to create together (this isn't a jurousy post, she's gay af). Anyways this night she pulled out some paints and a canvas. I was feeling pretty light hearted and buzzed so I began to paint/ collab with her and my partner. It was fun! When I woke up I looked at the canvas on the table and they both had essentially painted over most of what I did where you couldn't really recognize my original creation. I was pretty offended, and it solidified that sense of being inferior. I texted my partner to say I thought it was \"not cool\" and pretty rude where he responded with \"are you seriously mad? It's a collaboration...\" This actually kind of angered me further because it felt patronizing like I don't understand what collaboration is! To me collabing is adding to, not covering, the original artist's contribution...\nUgh anyways! AITA for feeling offended by this?\n\nTl;dr Partner and friend are artistically talented, I'm not.Collaborated for fun on a painting where they mostly covered up what I made.

That doesn't make you an AH.\n\nI don't think your response was an AH response, either.  NTA", "YTA for being offended about the collaboration.  You know they are more talented than you.  You should be thankful for the opportunity to work with them and learn from them.  You should not get upset when they improve what you have contributed.  It\u2019s a collaboration not your work.  It sounds like you\u2019re lucky to be able to collaborate with them.", "Yep, the only time covering up your partner in a collab is okay is on an onlyfans collab", "Simple answer is: The other night we had gone out with some friends and ended up at our place staying up late and hanging out..... I was feeling pretty light hearted and buzzed......so intoxicating substances involved.....cognition, inhibitions, reasoning, etc, all affected....let it go.", "I don't know.  Is that ESH?  \n\nI obviously don't know what they were thinking, but from your description, the most likely explanation is that you are so lacking in confidence that they assumed you wouldn't mind if they used the space your work was in.  If you were as vocal as they are about what you do, they'd probably be more inclined to stop and think before bulldozing over you.  \n\nMy guess is that they were enthusiastic about whatever they were doing and painted over your stuff because they wanted to continue it.  They wouldn't have painted over each other's stuff because they knew that would cause offense.  \n\nCould that be it?  I honestly can't imagine that any (normal) friend or partner would deliberately paint over your contribution!  This is a lesson in being brave.  It may seem like you're protecting yourself from disappointment if you run yourself down before anyone else can, but I think a healthier approach is to remember that everyone starts somewhere.  Your partner and friend haven't always been great at art either!", "NTA. Pretty sure when people collaborate, they\u2019re working together. THEY collaborated on your art, without you.\n\nI had an art teacher do this to me in college. Picked up my brush and just started painting on my piece instead of offering critique. I could not believe it, and he was clearly miffed when I told him to stop. It no longer felt like mine. It was a really good piece, too! For the record, this is super rude to do in art world without asking first, even in an educational scenario.\n\nHe owes you an apology for overstepping, and owes you some validation of how that made you feel. Paint over some of his shit and see how he takes it as a \u201ccollaboration.\u201d Bet that wouldn\u2019t go over well.", "First of all, your partner is an asshole. You told him how you felt and he dismissed your feelings. He could've said sorry, and then try to explain why they did what they did, but he just dismissed you, so NTA.\n\nSecond, i don't know about visual arts collaborations, but i do know about being \"painted over\". I'm a musician, and i once recorded for some \"friend's\" album; however, when it came out i found out he re-recorded my parts with someone else and never told me. It felt awful, even when i didn't even like his music or my performance very much; it didn't matter, it was my performance and i was proud of it. So no, you're not wrong for feeling offended.", "NTA I could have gone with N A H if it weren\u2019t for his reaction the next day. I can understand the night of if they were drunk and just kept messing with the painting after you went to bed they might not have thought about how what they were covering up was your part. It wasn\u2019t like you\u2019d et out to create something made by the three of you that could be hung in your apartment or whatever. It sounds like everyone was just messing around. \n\nEven so, it makes sense that you would feel hurt. The part that makes your bf the AH is that he was so dismissive of your feelings. He could have apologized or explained ( maybe the cover up parts of each other\u2019s stuff too), but instead he gave you a hard time for being upset.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner should be more sensitive. He knows you're insecure, and a fun collaboration with someone who claims only to be an amateur should not be a competition nor should it be taken seriously as professional art.\n\nBe careful with this aspect of the relationship. Are you insecure because of your own stuff, or are you getting lowkey vibes from him that he's \"talented\" and you're not?\n\nThe idea of talent is bullshit and you should feel free to feel good about your art.", "I don't believe in collaborative art.   \nIt's always going to be this indecisive pedestrian shit.  \n\n\nIt's hard enough to have your own point of view. Art is about staying true to that when you find it.", "Seems like the three of you have different meanings for the word \u2018collaboration\u2019. Maybe talk to them about what it means to them so you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into next time, and you can decide if it sounds fun/respectful or not. I\u2019m dedicated to my art and practice almost daily, but to me \u2018collaboration\u2019 means that any mark at all from any contributing person is valid and fair game. I fully expect people to draw on my drawings if we\u2019re drawing together. NTA just seems like miscommunication.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were asleep when they changed your portion. That is nonconsensual revision, not collaboration. You wanted to feel involved and have fun and they spoiled that with their high handed 'correction' of your work. Professional grade art is not the only valid form of art. Art for fun, art for therapy, art as a hobby is still art. You aren't trying to make a living out of it, so your threshold of pride may be 'lower', but you still have a right to have be proud of it and not have it altered.", "NTA - No, it is not a 'collaboration' at all.  The two of them painted over your work and ruined it.  It was condescending and mean of them and you have every right to not only be offended but downright angry.  What they did by their actions was to display their arrogance of their talent over yours.  Demand an apology from both or they can both leave your life.  You don't need this type of disrespect in your life and you will always stand up for yourself.  Do it now.", "INFO: Were you all painting on the same canvas? You say they covered up most of your work. How much of the canvas did you paint? By \"covered up\" do you mean they actually fully painted over your work or did they paint additions onto what you had already painted (ie: if you painted a tree maybe they added more detail to the leaves and some fruit)?\n\nBased solely on what you've written I'm going to go with a light YTA. You have an inferiority complex about this situation which is fine bit the way you speak about it makes you seem bitter. Your  s/o regularly asks you to join in with them for fun on something they enjoy doing and you refuse to do it because you're too embarrassed of not being as good as them. That probably doesn't feel great for them.", "While you\u2019re entitled to your feelings, YTA if you think you deserve \u201ckid gloves,\u201d because you know your art isn\u2019t at the same level as others. You said you had fun but it sounds like it was only fun as long as your artwork remains the focal point of a collaboration? Your friend is right - You\u2019re absolutely taking things personally.\n\nI\u2019m also an artist. I know my strengths and my weaknesses. I\u2019ve done collaborations with others much more talented than I and I\u2019m just happy to be a part of it and so should you.", "Let it goooooooo. Art is for everyone.", "As an artist myself, you\u2019re right to feel how you feel. If you had covered up their work they\u2019d probably feel pretty shitty. I know I would. When I paint I put my all into every painting, so if someone just covered it up I\u2019d be butthurt. Especially if he knows you have these feelings of inferiority. However, art is subjective and there\u2019s truly no such thing as a bad artist. Someone will always be \u201cbetter,\u201d but when it comes to art I don\u2019t believe anyone is better than another. Art is in the eye of the beholder. NTA", "Hit the nail on the head with this one.", "They didnt improve, they painted over, they RUINED her art and art for her", "What hell...? She doesn't want nor need to 'learn', she wanted to feel involved and appreciated. Art at any skill level should not be altered. You sound like you would color over a child's drawing after snatching the crayons. They know where her skill level is and offered the collaboration and then painted over it AFTER she went to sleep. That's not collaboration. Collaboration is done while everyone is awake and making decisions about the piece.", "You know, good artists say the stupid shit you just said. Great artists are happy to be a part of someone else's growth and wouldn't dream of putting them down to \"improve\" the piece. Art is great in whatever state it is if the artist is happy with it.", "Hahaha this gave me a chuckle tbh. Love it.", "This is a good point for sure. It\u2019s not like a relationship ending conflict here, just trying to get some perspective.", "I don't get it. You're telling her she's an asshole for feeling inferior? And people shouldn't \"bulldoze\" over other people just because they feel superior/inferior, or assume they \"wouldn't mind\" getting their art destroyed.", ">Picked up my brush and just started painting on my piece instead of offering critique.\n\nI went to a Art hight school 1000 years ago and the Teachers wouldn't even dream to do this! The thought wouldn't even occur to them!", "I have a memory of an art teacher doing something similar. I asked for guidance and they picked up and eraser and erased what I had done. My jaw dropped haha. Like, ok tell me to start over if I need to but don\u2019t just annihilate what I worked on!", "She\u2019s the ah for being mad that her partner literally painted over her painting because he thinks he\u2019s better than her? That\u2019s the take your going with? Lol ok", "Yeah same canvas. And painted over as in, you can no longer see what I made because they put something on top of it.", "Interesting. Yeah to clarify I wasn\u2019t looking to be the star here. Just wanted my work to show through a bit in the final piece. I think the painting over made me feel like my contribution wasn\u2019t welcome which is where the wind came out of my sails.", "Bro they painted over her art what are you talking about", "Being happy to be a doormat for other people?  No way.  She wasn't asking for kid gloves but respect for her art and it is hers not to be gone over by some insipid jerks who believe they know better.  They don't and they never will.  And if the name applies...", "That\u2019s my point though I think. I felt my art deserved some space on the canvas just as much as theirs but it was effectively removed and replaced. This whole sub is about gaining perspective in conflicts lol", "There may not be such a thing as a bad artist but there is such a thing as shitty art and the quickest way to get there is not having boundaries and letting anyone and everything water your angle down.\n\nOP is TA for letting people shit on her work.", "Sure buddy.  The talented professional artists \u201cruined\u201d the amateur work.  Imagine thinking that happened\u2026", "She should take art classes and not work with professional artists if she wants to feel involved and appreciated.  I would not let a child with crayons collaborate on a professional work of art.  I would recommend that a child with crayons collaborate with other children with crayons.  Frankly, she is only involved in the collaboration because she is boning an artist who is much more talented than her.  Of course the professionals have to clean up her amateur contributions.  She should feel grateful to have been allowed to participate at all.  You know, like Yoko Ono should have been grateful to be included in making music with John Lennon and Chuck Berry rather than ruining it with her ridiculous bullshit.", "Professional artists don\u2019t collaborate with amateurs to make professional art.  Artists are happy to help other artists grow.  Artists are not happy to let untalented artists spoil a collaboration with talented people.  Picture the look on Chuck Berry\u2019s face when Yoko Ono starting shitting on his collaboration with John Lennon.  He was a great artist and wasn\u2019t happy about that ridiculous bullshit.", "Good for you.  If this were a repetitive event while sober NTA and concern is valid. Since intoxicating substances involved you should disregard any emotional response you have to it as their actions can't be easily judged as to intent; there likely wasn't any intent.", "Nope, I was very clear about not calling her TA.  Good try!  \n\nI was telling her that it sometimes hurts us to talk ourselves down.  When we make a big deal out of talking someone else up and ourselves down, then what we're doing is transferring power to that other person.  The other person will start acting like the boss who makes the decisions.\n\nIt doesn't mean the other person is bad.  It's a dynamic between both people and the point is that dynamics change when everyone involved changes.  The friend and partner have now been told by the OP that it wasn't OK to assume the OP wouldn't consider her contribution to be important enough to keep.  And I'm telling the OP that she has a part to play too.  She needs to stop telling people that her contributions don't matter.", "Tell me exactly where I said that. What i said was she was an AH for continually ignoring or denying her partners offers to join him in an activity he loves because of her perceived embarrassment or inferiority. I never said anything in my judgement about painting over the picture, in fact I asked clarifying questions about that bit.", "Lol they were painting drunk. It doesn\u2019t sound like they were making a gallery ready piece but go off", "You make a good point! I work as a creative for my job and most of the work is collaborative \u2014 in other words you bring your piece, I bring my piece and we all flex together to make it work as a shared project. It never feels good when a single person's contribution paints over the hard work of other team members. I encourage you to make art for yourself because creativity is free, it's for everyone to enjoy, and you do NOT have to be good at it whatsoever. Seriously, it's really fun when you can let go of the fear that comes with trying to do a new thing AND make it aesthetically \"right\" or \"good\". To heck with that. I make things for ME because it's rad to make things. In hindsight I think your partner and friend did you a little dirty painting over your contributions, but hopefully it's not the end of the world. Good luck on your creative journey! Making things just to make them is my mission in life.", "They did they ruined HER art they not only ruined art in general for her but they took her part of the 3 person collaboration and turned it into a 2 person collab without her just say your a bad person who hates people and go", "He\u2019s been asking her to collaborate and she didn\u2019t do it for exactly this reason. Instead of actually collaborating, he treated her part like it was worthless. This was supposed to be just for fun, not some work for sale. She doesn\u2019t need to be grateful that he allowed her to paint with him. If he were truly great he would be creative enough to incorporate what she did without covering it completely.", "Professional art? They were drunk, amongst friends.\n\nAlso, if they didn't want their \"untalented\" friend collaborating with them, they SHOULDN'T HAVE INVITED HER.", "You started with ESH. You know what that means, right?\n\nIf you act like \"the boss\" and exert power because someone else thinks you're better than them, you're a shitty person. I play music with plenty great artists who are significantly better than me and they are happy to create art with friends, not put me down for not being up to their standards.\n\nShe never said her \"contributions don't matter\". She said she felt inferior, which FRIENDS and PARTNERS would help her overcome, for example by letting her be a happy part of a creation with no professional purpose.", "You weren\u2019t asked if she was an ah for that I\u2019m so tired of pathetic losers thinking they just get an opinion on other people\u2019s lives lmao she asked if she was the ah for being upset that he painted over her work you saying she\u2019s an ah cuz she doesn\u2019t usually paint with him is ridiculous and him doing this is exactly why she doesn\u2019t", "All the more reason they were assholes for painting over her part. It wasn't for a gallery, so it didn't need to be \"perfect\" (which is a subjective ideal anyway), meaning there was no good reason for them to paint over and destroy her contribution to the piece.  \nThat was totally cruel on their part.\n\nNTA OP", "Yeah, so why the need to cover up everything she did? This was such a low stakes situation and they could have worked around her if they didn\u2019t like her contribution.", "Thank you for clarifying your meaning! It\u2019s not the end of the world at all, I know. It actually kind of gave me this \u201cI\u2019ll show them!\u201d inspiration to just go work on my own shit that they can\u2019t bulldoze. Just felt\u2026.shitty at the time, esp. for my partner to be dismissive.", "Some great art gets created with the aid of alcohol and stronger drugs.  Inspiration,\n\nShe\u2019s boning a talented artist.  I expect that alters his judgement about when to include her.", "No one is saying they're acting like the bosses.  The OP is bending over backwards to communicate with them that she doesn't feel good enough.  They're not her therapists.  It's not their fault if they take her words at face value and don't understand that she doesn't mean them.  You can't communicate that you're subordinate in anything to do with a particular issue and then be surprised when people treat you that way.\n\nIt's not fair to expect the partner and friend to guess that the OP means what she is not saying.  The OP does need to learn how to be more confident.  Like I said (! Not repeating it again!) she has done the right thing by telling them she didn't actually mean to talk herself down and would like her work to be shown more respect in future.", "Show them! I hate hate hate artistic gatekeeping. I believe in you :)", "Haha thanks! I feel the same!"]}
