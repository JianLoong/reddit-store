Any connection you have to those children is severed, and i promise you the 12 year old almost definitely thinks poorly of you already. You were completely right in your final decision, you will not receive any gratitude for your money. This money will not buy you a relationship with her children.

That doesn't make you an AH. You don't have to feel the way anyone else would.\n\nBut if you believe that in 30 years you are going to regret your decision, then you have an obligation to *yourself* to re-explore your options here.\n\n... I do also want to say that I agree with the other replies which have cautioned against giving your sister the money directly. If you *do* choose to help, pay the money to where you believe it should go. If you put money in her hands, you lose the right to say what she must do with it. \n\n... judgement... eh... I don't agree with her decision to cut you off, but we have a right to choose our own values, so I can't judge her for that... and I would call everyone I'd ever met for help if my kid was going through this...

No exchange of actual cash.", "It's not that nuanced. OP's sister cut OP out of their lives and would not have thought twice about that decision if not for the current circumstances. She made her sister a literal stranger. Let that sink in. No love, no help, and no relationship for how long?\n\nThink about that. If OP had cancer and could no longer work as a camgirl and she went to her sister for help do you honestly think that hypocritical Christian would even help out? No. She would say it's God's punishment for OP's job. Or something like it. Or she'd force her to accept Jesus in her life before handing out a dime of help. \n\nOP is completely innocent in her sister's decision to cut her out. She shouldn't be put on the hook for her sister's bad decisions. If you can't afford children, don't have them.

I've never seen a parent who had to pay for their child's cancer treatment.  There's a Medicaid program called Disabled Child Living at Home, that children with extreme medical conditions are eligible for.  The whole idea behind it is to prevent tons of parents from losing/giving up custody of their disabled/sick children just because they can't afford the care.  Now, I only work inpatient, so I'm getting involved with cases where these kids are getting bone marrow transplants and/or months of inpatient chemotherapy.  More minor forms of cancer that have less costly outpatient treatments may not make a child eligible.

The feelings of the adults in this really doesn't matter compared to that.", "OP wanted a relationship with her nephew, so not a complete stranger.", "Your dad clearly did bad things, but the five year old is probably innocent. The sister was TA here, and she's not the sick one.", "True.  That mentality doesn't age well.", "But it isn't the nephew's fault that he doesn't have a relationship with his aunt.  This 5 yo didn't choose cancer, either.\n\nWhatever OP does, she needs to focus on the nephew, not the wretched, judgmental sister.", "Bro replied to the wrong comment", "People on Reddit would rather be right then help their nephew who has cancer.

I mean, should this kid be vomiting on the street?", ">The nephew getting sicker has nothing to do with OP.\n\nIt has nothing to do with OP's twin's words and actions either.\n\n>Her sister did that.\n\nHer sister, not her nephew. The right thing to do is to set all issues aside and help contribute in whatever way she can (as long as OP's twin doesn't abuse). Just like the kid could still die from cancer he could still survive and defeat his cancer. After the situation is contained or resolved, things can go back to how they've been if that's what the sisters want. This isn't OP forgiving her sister, it's OP being a mature adult doing what's right.", "The fact is that \n1 op wanted to have a relationship with the kids and has always been sad she couldn't.

The one who's going to suffer more here, is not op's sister, it's her children.\n\nEdit: forgot a NOT", ">Throwing money at it might not save it anyway.\n\nIt still could. It's better to be safe than sorry. The money is going to go towards the kid's treatment and well-being, not to OP's sister. By helping her nephew, OP isn't automatically forgiving her sister, she's just setting aside all problems temporarily to deal with the bigger one: cancer.

It's a 50/50 shot and even if there were only a 0.1% chance of saving the kid's life or anyone else's life in general, you take that chance. I get that OP isn't the doctor, a surgeon, a biochemist, or a billionaire like Elon Musk, but any help she can provide should be given as long as her sister doesn't take advantage and/or abuse. It's being a mature adult, it's setting all issues aside to deal with the real issue, that being cancer.
