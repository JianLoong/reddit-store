After 20 minutes or so I go and grab a slice and someone says \"try the coleslaw, it's really nice\" so I do and agree. Then they tell me that my other friend who I have known for about 15 years had just dipped his penis in the coleslaw and swirled it around. He was watching at the time and didn't try and stop me eating it. I felt sick and they just laughed.\n\nOnce they realised I was genuinely disgusted and not laughing with them AT ALL the guy that told me to eat it apologised profusely (although he was still amused) and he even later ate the rest of the coleslaw! But my friend who had done it wasn't even phased that I was upset he just shrugged and kept smiling.\n\nAlso were in our 30s, not fucking teenagers! \n\nThe friend did try and apologise later in the night a couple times but I didn't accept it and honestly I just don't feel like talking to him at all anymore.
