He is 7 months old. My wife was diagnosed with postpartum depression about 2 months ago and it\u2019s been hard trying to manage for both of us. I started working less hours so I can be with them both more often and that\u2019s been helping.\n\nSince our son was born, we have not been away from him once. We have not had a break. Not even having his grandparents watch him while we get a night. My wife will not allow it. She doesn\u2019t want to be away from him at all. So much she doesn\u2019t even want to use the bathroom with him out of her eyesight. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve been dying for a break. Going to work then being on daddy duty without even one night to ourselves has been exhausting. My youngest sister got engaged about a year ago and her wedding is in 2 months. We already planned on attending but since the birth my wife has been against this. She doesn\u2019t want us to go as it\u2019s a destination wedding and we\u2019d likely have to leave for at least 5 days without our son.\n\nMy feeling is that we need to go. This is my family and it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event for her and I know it would deeply hurt her if we did not attend. It also would be good for both of us to get a short break. It may even do some work for her mental health.\n\nLast weekend I made it a priority for us to have a full conserverait about this. I told her my feelings and suggested that we give our son to her parents for a short while so we can go.\n\nShe was livid. She said I was prioritizing my wants over my obligations as a father and I can just drop our son anytime I want to do something fun. She said that I can go but she will be \u201ctoo busy being a parent to come with\u201d and that if I go I better find a place to different place to stay when I come back.\n\nThis made me feel guilty but I\u2019m really not sure if it should. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be a bad dad for wanting to see my siblings wedding. Nor do I think it\u2019s fair for her to threaten me like this. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675351765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rsiu4/aita_for_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Five days is a long time for a new mother to be away from her child. My wife would absolutely never agreed to this as well (although she wouldn't have yelled at me about it). There are so many fears with a first child and to go from constantly together to nearly a week apart is probably too much for her.\n\nEdit: I also think leaving on her own for 5 days is also really rough.

Can't it be possible for you to bring your in-laws with you for the sole purpose of helping and watching the baby during the rehearsal, wedding, and reception. Your wife can then check on the baby whenever she wants, and you have childcare so you can relax and have a break, and the baby wouldn't be separated from mom for 5 whole days. That sounds reasonable to me.", "NAH\n\nYou definitely deserve this break AND to celebrate your sister's marriage with her.\n\nIf your wife is dealing with PPD, this isn't about her being an a-hole, this is about her needing and getting treatment (even if already in place).

She went through 9 months carrying your son, then gave birth to him and is now recovering. It\u2019s been rougher on her than you probably know. No shame on wanting a break.

So she could watch your son on the day of the wedding but when you came back to the hotel, your wife can still spend time with the child.", "NAH. your wants are reasonable since being a parent to a newborn is exhausting. She's obviously having a hard time separating from the baby but as a mother that is completely justifiable. You're allowed to want to see your sister get married as that is an extremely important event. Your wife's feelings are justified because not wanting to leave the baby is very anxiety provoking. I recommend having a consultation with a doctor and maybe forming a plan that would make both of you comfortable leaving the baby as long as its safe to do so.", "NTA.\n\nIs she getting any professional help? She definitely needs it. This is not healthy. If she is not getting professional help, make sure you know you are doing this because you love her and want her at her best. Good luck with that.\n\nAs to the wedding, I would personally make it my hill to die on. If your wife will not see reason and will not seek the help she needs, you will need your family for support. If she makes this a bigger problem, separate and get legal custody (at least to the greatest extent possible, a father will virtually always get at least 50/50 if he pursues it.

She shouldn't be forced to go if she doesn't want to, but telling you to find somewhere else to live after is ... \ud83d\ude2c much (this is leaning towards shes the AH just a bit). PPD/A is serious, yes, but it sounds like she's not coping very well. Is she seeing a therapist for it?

Can you compromise and bring the baby with you so you both get a vacation?  Even if your wife doesn't go to the wedding to stay with the baby, at least you'll all be together and it will only be a matter of hours, not days, that you are away.  Never mind the baby, she doesn't sound well enough to be left alone for 5 days. \n\nIt's not unreasonable to want to go to your sister's wedding.  You can be a good parent and still have a life (in fact you'll probably be a better parent if you have a life).", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is in the wrong here. This behavior is common with new moms, but that doesn't necessarily justify her trying to keep you away from your sisters wedding.\n\nYes, you have an obligation as a father to be there as much as you can, but you haven't had a single day off of parenting since the child was born. You would not be wrong to go away for a few days to see a family member get married.\n\nIt sounds like she could benefit from seeing a therapist who specializes in postpartum depression.\n\nGo to your sisters wedding, don't be guilted out that.", "NTA I get that she\u2019s depressed, but she\u2019s also being incredibly manipulative. She is calling you a bad parent for wanting to see your family and is threatening to kick you out.\n\nFrom what I can tell\n\n> Going to work, then being on daddy duty\n\nImplies that your wife doesn\u2019t work.

Maybe you can work up to this by having your inlaws watch your  baby for a few hours during the day and then see about an overnight break.", "NTA. You are not unreasonable or a bad parent for wanting to go support and celebrate your sister for 5 days. Your child will not be damaged by being cared for by other loving people. \n\nYour wife is also not unreasonable to want to stay with her child and to prefer not to go. I didn\u2019t sleep away from my kids for almost two years after they were born. It was just too stressful for me and I couldn\u2019t have any fun, so what was the point of forcing it? We did day trips/date nights, but not overnights. I do wish we\u2019d done overnights earlier in hindsight because they had a harder time with it starting in the clingy toddler years. \n\nBut, this isn\u2019t an N A H situation because she is telling you that you\u2019re awful for not feeling the same way as she does, to the point that she doesn\u2019t want you to come back if you go. That\u2019s not fair or reasonable at all, and it worries me a lot. \n\nThe easy solution here is for you to go, because everyone gets to do thing thing that feels right to them with no real downsides other than the distance for 5 days, and yet that seems unforgivable to her.

I started working less hours so I can be with them both more often and that\u2019s been helping.\n\nSince our son was born, we have not been away from him once. We have not had a break. Not even having his grandparents watch him while we get a night. My wife will not allow it. She doesn\u2019t want to be away from him at all. So much she doesn\u2019t even want to use the bathroom with him out of her eyesight. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve been dying for a break.

She doesn\u2019t want us to go as it\u2019s a destination wedding and we\u2019d likely have to leave for at least 5 days without our son.\n\nMy feeling is that we need to go.

If I\u2019m being brutally honest, I think you should be very clear with your wife here that you WILL attend the wedding and it\u2019s just about how she would like it to happen. She has post pardem and the baby is healthy, neither are physically sick or in any significant danger. \n\nI also like anyone suggesting bringing a helper along if your wife does want to come but bring the baby. \n\nDo not miss your sisters wedding, you will resent your wife for this down the line regardless of her diagnosis.", "NAH, but your wife needs to be on meds and in therapy, if she's not already.

PPD is horrible, so I completely understand why your wife feels the way she does. Additionally, 5 days away from a baby that is less than a year old isn\u2019t reasonable.

For either of you.  \n\nHowever, this is your first child, first children come with a lot of hover hover hover, no breaks, throw yourself 10000% into it.  It's worse for first time moms.  You HAVE to recognize this.  It isn't optional.  You HAVE to.  \n\nShe has to be made to understand that taking breaks is good as well.  That by you two going to the wedding, doesn't make her a bad mom.  It doesn't make you a bad dad.  It doesn't mean that you're choosing to drop your obligation for every fun thing that comes along.  She also has to learn that threatening you with divorce because you go to your sister's wedding can be considered abuse.  Her not being able to go to the bathroom without having the baby visible to her is very, VERY concerning.  She needs help, her diagnosis is a good start, but she needs more.  \n\nThe other side here, is that you both need to compromise.  Going away for 5 days might be too much.
