He is 7 months old. My wife was diagnosed with postpartum depression about 2 months ago and it\u2019s been hard trying to manage for both of us. I started working less hours so I can be with them both more often and that\u2019s been helping.\n\nSince our son was born, we have not been away from him once. We have not had a break. Not even having his grandparents watch him while we get a night. My wife will not allow it. She doesn\u2019t want to be away from him at all. So much she doesn\u2019t even want to use the bathroom with him out of her eyesight. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve been dying for a break. Going to work then being on daddy duty without even one night to ourselves has been exhausting. My youngest sister got engaged about a year ago and her wedding is in 2 months. We already planned on attending but since the birth my wife has been against this. She doesn\u2019t want us to go as it\u2019s a destination wedding and we\u2019d likely have to leave for at least 5 days without our son.\n\nMy feeling is that we need to go. This is my family and it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event for her and I know it would deeply hurt her if we did not attend. It also would be good for both of us to get a short break. It may even do some work for her mental health.\n\nLast weekend I made it a priority for us to have a full conserverait about this. I told her my feelings and suggested that we give our son to her parents for a short while so we can go.\n\nShe was livid. She said I was prioritizing my wants over my obligations as a father and I can just drop our son anytime I want to do something fun. She said that I can go but she will be \u201ctoo busy being a parent to come with\u201d and that if I go I better find a place to different place to stay when I come back.\n\nThis made me feel guilty but I\u2019m really not sure if it should. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be a bad dad for wanting to see my siblings wedding. Nor do I think it\u2019s fair for her to threaten me like this. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675351765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rsiu4/aita_for_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 1278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Five days is a long time for a new mother to be away from her child. My wife would absolutely never agreed to this as well (although she wouldn't have yelled at me about it). There are so many fears with a first child and to go from constantly together to nearly a week apart is probably too much for her.\n\nEdit: I also think leaving on her own for 5 days is also really rough.

If it was close by, you would absolutely not be TA. But it's a destination wedding and that's super stressful for a parent, especially one that is filled with PPD and anxiety.\n\nI do have a suggestion, though. Can't it be possible for you to bring your in-laws with you for the sole purpose of helping and watching the baby during the rehearsal, wedding, and reception. Your wife can then check on the baby whenever she wants, and you have childcare so you can relax and have a break, and the baby wouldn't be separated from mom for 5 whole days. That sounds reasonable to me.", "NAH\n\nYou definitely deserve this break AND to celebrate your sister's marriage with her.\n\nIf your wife is dealing with PPD, this isn't about her being an a-hole, this is about her needing and getting treatment (even if already in place).

She went through 9 months carrying your son, then gave birth to him and is now recovering. It\u2019s been rougher on her than you probably know. No shame on wanting a break. Could you take your son with you? Or could you maybe do 3 days away instead of 5? Find some sort of compromise?", "NAH.  PPD is T A.  She does need counseling ASAP and perhaps medication, too.  I would really work with her to see there is a compromise that works for you both.

So she could watch your son on the day of the wedding but when you came back to the hotel, your wife can still spend time with the child.", "NAH. your wants are reasonable since being a parent to a newborn is exhausting. She's obviously having a hard time separating from the baby but as a mother that is completely justifiable. You're allowed to want to see your sister get married as that is an extremely important event. Your wife's feelings are justified because not wanting to leave the baby is very anxiety provoking. I recommend having a consultation with a doctor and maybe forming a plan that would make both of you comfortable leaving the baby as long as its safe to do so.", "NTA.\n\nIs she getting any professional help? She definitely needs it. This is not healthy. If she is not getting professional help, make sure you know you are doing this because you love her and want her at her best. Good luck with that.\n\nAs to the wedding, I would personally make it my hill to die on. If your wife will not see reason and will not seek the help she needs, you will need your family for support. If she makes this a bigger problem, separate and get legal custody (at least to the greatest extent possible, a father will virtually always get at least 50/50 if he pursues it. Your son will need a healthy parent in his life.", "Eesh. I'm gonna say NAH (but only just, definitely NTA on your part) You should be able to go to your sister's wedding. She shouldn't be forced to go if she doesn't want to, but telling you to find somewhere else to live after is ... \ud83d\ude2c much (this is leaning towards shes the AH just a bit). PPD/A is serious, yes, but it sounds like she's not coping very well. Is she seeing a therapist for it?

Does she have a therapist?\n\nFive days is a huge ask for someone who has trouble leaving their kid out of sight even for minutes. But no breaks isn't doable either.\n\nSit down again, find some kind of compromise.

Maybe you can work up to this by having your inlaws watch your  baby for a few hours during the day and then see about an overnight break.", "NTA. You are not unreasonable or a bad parent for wanting to go support and celebrate your sister for 5 days.

I didn\u2019t sleep away from my kids for almost two years after they were born. It was just too stressful for me and I couldn\u2019t have any fun, so what was the point of forcing it?

I started working less hours so I can be with them both more often and that\u2019s been helping.\n\nSince our son was born, we have not been away from him once. We have not had a break. Not even having his grandparents watch him while we get a night. My wife will not allow it. She doesn\u2019t want to be away from him at all. So much she doesn\u2019t even want to use the bathroom with him out of her eyesight. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve been dying for a break. Going to work then being on daddy duty without even one night to ourselves has been exhausting. My youngest sister got engaged about a year ago and her wedding is in 2 months. We already planned on attending but since the birth my wife has been against this. She doesn\u2019t want us to go as it\u2019s a destination wedding and we\u2019d likely have to leave for at least 5 days without our son.\n\nMy feeling is that we need to go.

Consider attending a therapy session with your wife (as long as she and the therapist are ok with this) to work out some solutions for attending the wedding. I hope you\u2019re both able to come up with a plausible solution!", "And an extra option to add OP:\nIf you want to go (and I get why, it is your sisters wedding) you could ask someone (or multiple people) to stay with your wife and baby at home. Dragging your wife there is going to add to her trauma and might result in a break down or set back. She would not have a good time at the wedding. If she wants to stay home she should. Maybe you can hire a nanny or night watch to make sure everything is fine and ask other friends and family to check on her so you don\u2019t have to worry about her and your baby.", "Nobody is calling the wife TA for her over the top not to mention hurtful reaction? She said he can choose between keeping his marriage and going to his sister\u2019s wedding. She\u2019s TA 100%.

The best thing she did was go back to work. She didn't need to work by any means but she got a little part time job and she was immediately so much happier, it gave her some space and my neice has amazing social skills which may be down to her being in nursery since she was 6 months. But I genuinely think that job saved my sisters life. Maybe OPs wife needs an outlet.", "NTA and I think having someone come along to help with the baby is a fantastic idea!!", "Agree with all of this. NAH. Your wife clearly isn\u2019t ready and continuing to pressure her is probably a bad idea. You should be able to go to your sisters wedding though. Arranging someone like her family to stay with her while you\u2019re gone would be a good call. Or taking baby with you. If you can\u2019t afford to take a caregiver your wife could even skip the wedding events and just be there together. Maybe by that time she\u2019d be ready to do an evening just the two of you if your family was willing and able to watch baby and you\u2019re within the same hotel. Good luck.", "Totally agree. I think it's important to recognise also though that:\n\n1.OP's mental health is equally important as his wife's mental health and he's stated repeatedly that he *needs* a break.\n\n2. Not attending the wedding could have a lifelong negative impact on his relationships with his family. He not only needs the break but he needs to attend his sisters wedding.\n\nI like your compromise of him making it a shorter trip (if possible, the 5 days might be a day to travel, a day to recover, a day for the wedding, family brunch the next day and recover from wedding, a day to travel home) and having someone stay with his wife so that she's not caring for the baby alone.\n\nThat said, this seems like an incredibly severe case of PP separation anxiety and I do wonder what treatment and therapies OPs wife is receiving.\n\nI had severe PP separation anxiety due to a traumatic birth, which involved my baby and I almost dying. I didn't sleep for months because I **needed** to check on her every 10 minutes and make sure she was breathing. Treatment and quite extensive therapy helped and by the baby was 7 months old I was in a much better place (not fully, but better than I was). \n\nSo this is a bigger issue than just one destination wedding. OPs wife seems to be needing more mental health support than she's getting. Still not being able to use the bathroom without the baby in sight doesn't seem as though much progress has been made. Medication is trial and error, and finding the right therapy and therapist can take time.\n\nI'd suggest that OP focus on helping his wife to find the best possible treatment and care for herself, while making it clear that his mental health matters too and he needs to attend this wedding.", "Agreed. I had really bad postpartum anxiety and hated being away from my son. He goes to preschool now 2 days a week for 2.5 hours. I cried like a baby when I dropped him off the first time. I've never left him overnight and have no plans to do so any time soon. The thought fills me with extreme panic. It's even worse with an infant.

I had to have my 8 week old baby (my firstborn) taken away from me (planned) for a week while I was hospitalised, my partner had to work so my newborn had to stay with my parents 110 miles away. It was the hardest week of my life. The pain and stress of my illness was absolutely nothing compared to the emotional pain of being separated from my child. My entire body was just screaming for my baby, and not being able to hold her was torture. I developed separation anxiety around my children (though it is *extremely* mild today), and I needed to know exactly where they were at all times and be within at least the same building as them. I think taking a baby away from their mother for the first time is something that needs to be built up to gradually, not just a sudden 5 day separation.\n\n\nEdit: for everyone saying I need help, I have been getting help from a therapist since my hospital discharge. I'm currently doing really well, and was talking mostly from past tense. At the time this occured I only had the one child, who was 8 weeks old. I have two children now, but over the years my symptoms have become so mild they are unnoticeable unless I choose to talk about them. Both of my children are under the age of five and I was using my own story to say that a sudden separation of mum and baby is traumatic, and more often than not, it is underestimated. None of my children are traumatised, so unnecessary comments like that are not appreciated, and actually come across as quite hostile. While I had anxiety I also had self control, so I was well aware of limiting my behaviours and not forcing toxic boundaries onto my children.

But finding an alternative - shorter trip, bringing a friend along - is going to be better than going (with or without her). I think part of this is that the OP wants a break *from the baby*, and given where his wife is, that may not be possible right now without causing problems in the relationship.\n\nNot the question, but it may be worthwhile on them having 1x1 time with the baby while the other is on a break.

I think OP cavalierly suggesting they spend 5 full days away from a baby that will be 9 months old is a bit of an AH move too though. That's a lot of time to spend away from a baby that young.

But even without PPD and with a very easy baby and my mum staying over I didn't enjoy my husband going away for a stag party and leaving me with the baby. I was glad to do it for him but it was hard.

Honestly, aside from the wedding, that\u2019s just not healthy, for her or the baby, she should at least be able to leave baby for a few hours at a time. She really should talk to her doctor and maybe a therapist. That level of anxiety over her husband wanting to do something very reasonable is also concerning.  And that her anxiety is so high that instead of looking for reasonable solutions so her husband can attend the wedding she jumps right to absolutely not I\u2019ll divorce you? That\u2019s someone who really needs help, her judgment is skewed.", "There is something seriously wrong for the way she threatened him for wanting to attend his sister's wedding.", "I\u2019m not asking about leaving a 9 month old away for 5 days. \n \nThe \u201c2 month timeline\u201d you say isn\u2019t reasonable is entirely self inflicted. You have truncated the timeline by ignoring the issue. The wedding has been known about for over a year, the fact that it is now 2 months away and the mother can\u2019t even pee without having the baby with her is again, self inflicted and not OP\u2019s fault. Most kids are in daycare long, long before this. \n \n2 months is a more than reasonable timeline to be able to break this behavior and take a shortened trip. It should have already happened, this isn\u2019t healthy for any of the 3 involved.", "When she got pregnant, there should have been a conversation about this wedding, regardless of her now having PPD. They knew for a year about the wedding. Baby gestated for 9 out of those 12 months. There needed to be a talk about whether a destination wedding was ever feasible with a newborn. I'm curious to know how wife was expecting to go to this event if she thought about it during the time she was still pregnant", "Future psychiatrist here (who has worked as a doctor in psychiatry already), mental health can only generally be used in a court room if it means the person had so serious issues that their cognitive capabilites/judgement could be dismissed, and they would qualify for like conpulsory care. It differs from country to country but PPD wouldnt hold up in most courts, PPP definately would though but it isnt mentioned here. Using psychiatric issues is very serious and while some issues are understandable it isnt generally \u201dexcusable\u201d, there seems to be some general misconception about that though.", "(Not disagreeing with the rest tho)", "I mean I wouldn't call her an AH either, depression is a severe problem but OP is also definitely justified for wanting a break and feeling hurt over his wife jumping straight to divorce and implying he is a bad parent. \nAnd op has been helping so far, I assume he is going to continue doing so but his life can't just be helping out with the baby and considering her wife's needs, he is allowed to want things too. Like going to his sister's wedding.\nIt wasn't just OP who made those promises, there is two people in the marriage.\nMaybe they could have a joint session with wife's therapist and they could help come up with a compromise? I agree with the NAH judgement but just doing what the wife wants all the time is just not healthy.", "If I had to guess, I would say that the one who ended up on Reddit had the more behavior problems.", "It would be fair to reply \"That's a ridiculous thing to ask of me, of course I can't leave the baby for 5 days.\"\n\nIt's NOT fair to threaten divorce if he chooses to go to the wedding alone. \n\nIt's a massive asshole move to threaten that.", ">lack the ability to manipulate right\n\nSo, first of all, the kid was 1. Second of all, 1 year olds can absolutely manipulate.", ">She was an absolute nightmare to live with and probably close to injuring/killing one of the kids.\n\nAnd you're worrying that they unfairly put her on meds?", ">you can\u2019t have one person as your only support system \n\nSorry to be a bit snarky but saying that doesn\u2019t change the situation many parents find themselves in, with no *option* for any type of support group. If OPs wife doesn\u2019t have dependable or present family/friends in the area, then he simply *is* her only support. Medical staff in America only provides borderline emergent care, they can hardly be considered \u201csupport.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but the reason I struggle to *not* call him an asshole is his admittance that his wife has a PPD diagnosis but his clear lack of understanding how that would effect her or their relationships. It seems so blas\u00e9 and uncaring to not have the most basic grasp of PPD. Especially to the degree that you can\u2019t gather that your wife would *never* leave her child for 5 days straight and it would set her off massively to attempt to press the issue. I feel like there\u2019s way more awareness and common knowledge regarding PPD (especially for people regularly using Reddit and posting on this sub) to give OP the benefit of the doubt. \n\nHe should have helped her address this a long time ago, or reached out for support to address this since we can gather from the post he\u2019s at least close to some of his family even though we don\u2019t know the wife\u2019s predicament.

I\u2019d be worried for them both.", "I agree that you should not compare it. That was my point, illness is illness. Maybe it came out wrong but that's what I meant. People need to take mental illness as seriously as physical. Also i agree that ultimatums are horrible way to deal with anything but being mentally ill very often means that your brain is not very rational. We don't know if she did this before but if she didn't then this is the PPD speaking.", "Exactly dude! It takes a fucking village.", "Yes.

I don\u2019t think the husband wanting to go alone is at all reasonable for 5 days, but she shouldn\u2019t be jumping to divorce.

Did you miss that part of the title of the post?", "PPD (or PPA, which sounds much like it\u2019s in play here) is NOT \u201cself-inflicted\u201d. It\u2019s hormonally driven. I\u2019d wager quite a bit the wife would prefer to differently as well but doesn\u2019t realize this is possible. Daycare is also totally different than traveling to a 5 day destination wedding.\nIf nothing else, this should be a huge wakeup call to the husband and her family that her current treatments are not adequate and she needs more mental health care.", "It seems like everyone involved is aware that her behavior is not healthy, given that she has been diagnosed with PPD and is presumably in treatment for it. It\u2019s not OPs fault this is happening to her, but it\u2019s not her fault either.\n\n\nPPD and PPA are not things you can just\u2026muscle through and you\u2019re all set. Treatment (any combination of drugs+therapy) can help a lot, but it\u2019s not an instant magic bullet. PPD is often triggered by the intense fluctuation of hormones during pregnancy and after birth. It is simply not something that OPs wife has control over\u2014it\u2019s a horrible shitstorm that she now hs to weather ON TOP of being a new parent.\n\nRecovery from a profound mental health crisis doesn\u2019t just happen because you need or want it do. \n\nI\u2019m not discounting how difficult this time must be for OP. But I would wager it is objectively, measurably *worse* for his wife. A lot of these responses are so devoid of empathy, as though OPs wife\u2019s situation is the product of lack of willpower.", "Well, this post is about leaving a 9 month old for 5 days. Do you wanna clarify what *you\u2019re* talking about?\n\nHow short is this short trip? 3 days? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to not want to leave your baby to go on a 3 day vacation. And honestly there isn\u2019t a reason they have to leave the baby at home - OP wants that because OP wants a break. But I don\u2019t think a vacation is a sensible first break for him and his wife. I think date night would be. Or a spa day. \n\nAs for the problem being self-inflicted, I agree b it don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant. We\u2019re discussing reasonable solutions, and that means we can\u2019t backseat drive the past. Just because his wife\u2019s current emotional state isn\u2019t his fault doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have some responsibility towards helping her, and it doesn\u2019t give him crate Blanche to wash his hands of it and feel persecuted. It\u2019s not her fault, either - she literally had PPD and is (hopefully) being treated for it. If they haven\u2019t gotten to this part in her therapy, it\u2019s likely because they\u2019re focusing on other, more important things that negatively effect her daily functioning. Now this doesn\u2019t mean that this doesn\u2019t effect her daily functioning negatively, but I can easily see there being other, bigger problems. \n\nThere are a lot of parents that don\u2019t do daycare - even low income ones - simply because daycare costs more than one parent\u2019s wages. And I say that as a preschool teacher. \n\nSaying that they shouldn\u2019t been preparing for the wedding for the past year - when they were 4 months pregnant - means nothing. That all goes flying out the window when the baby gets there. Some wedding that\u2019s 9 months away? You don\u2019t think about that daily. You\u2019re just trying to survive. Especially with a new mental illness. Of course she doesn\u2019t want him to go a leave her alone for 5 days with all the work; she\u2019s drowning. She needs him. \n\nI think the solution of the in-laws coming along to take care of the baby so mom can pop back and forth and hopefully they can work on Mom being able to be away from baby for a few hours in the two months in between is probably the best solution, but who knows how financially feasible that is for OP.", "If it's his sister he might have more stuff he needs to attend, like rehearsal dinner and family brunch the next day", "It's also an asshole move to say your going to this wedding for 5 full days without any sort of compromise on your part. Five days is a long time to be away. Guess what. Everyone iss being illogical here.", "Well if you take the view that you're you're team and one part is just absconding then it's not entirely ridiculous.", "The prefrontal cortex needs to be developed in order to manipulate, something that a 1 year old lacks.", "Oh my god. That is absolutely horrific! That poor family! I just looked it up. Apparently, her insurance denied her hospitalization?! WTF?!", "Let\u2019s hope they find a healthy compromise. OP sounds like he\u2019s trying.", "I mean to be fair, OP *is* taking her PPD seriously. Just b/c he would like to attend his little sisters wedding, doesn\u2019t belittle how serious OP is taking it.", ">It would be a joint custody that in all likelihood would favor the mother at least when they reach school age.\n\nJoint custody is usually 50/50, and if not, it \"favours\" the *primary caregiver before the divorce.* Not a specific gender.\n\nBut many people think getting \"more custody\" (3 days a week instead of 4 for example) = winning a divorce, regardless of the children and what's best for them", "I think the husband wanting to go alone *if* he agrees to shave it down to the minimum amount of time required to actually be at the wedding is reasonable, especially if some alternative support can be arranged for his wife. \n\nGoing to a family wedding, destination or not, is different than saying \"I want to go on vacation\" and I can't help but wonder if she would feel differently if it was *her* family.", "So there's no reasonable way you can possibly see for OP to attend his sister's wedding?", "I thought the person you are replying to here meant the \"two months left\" is self inflicted (ie: they should have been working on this sooner)", "At **no point** did I say PPD was self inflicted. Not even close. I directly said the 2 month timeline was self inflicted due to this issue not being resolved when it came up, because OP directly stated:\n \n>We already planned on attending but **since the birth** my wife has been against this. \n \nThis is not a new issue. This is not an issue that suddenly popped up 2 months before the wedding. This has been a known issue, since the child was born, that they have not addressed. \n \nNo idea how you read my comment and somehow got \u201cPPD is self inflicted.\u201d", "I haven\u2019t seen any comments suggesting willpower is the cure for PPD, or the magic bullet, or that the wife\u2019s struggles aren\u2019t worse than OP\u2019s. \n \nOP has said the wife has been in treatment, which is why my comment said I would expect 2 months to be a reasonable timeline for feeling comfortable breaking this behavior. PPD hits everyone unfortunate enough to have it differently, but I would expect to far surpass being able to pee without your kid present after 2 months of treatment. If not, you should have already talked to your doctor about hormone therapy and alternatives, but that\u2019s a tangent.", "Leaving a child with trusted caregivers for a short family obligation is not abandonment. Stop being preposterous.", "I agree that he does. I don't think he is handling her illness wrong and he has every right to want to go. I wanted to say that the responses would have probably be different if it was different illness. Also attending a wedding for a few hours and being away for 5 days is very different. His sister knew that he would have a baby at this point and that a lot of things can go wrong, you should be preprared for that when you plan a destination wedding. I know OP is stuck in a very tough situation right now but creating a family means also sacrificing sometimes. I think it would be fair for everyone if he goes only for one day for the actual wedding.", "No you didn\u2019t say she should be able to pee alone in two months\u2014you said that 2 months is a more than reasonable timeline to be well enough to *take a trip without the baby.* MOST of the first time parents I know who didn\u2019t even struggle with PPD or PPA wouldn\u2019t have felt comfortable leaving their baby for that long at that age.\n\nHow, exactly, do you expect her PPD to respond to this timeline if you don\u2019t think she just needs to\u2026try harder? I\u2019m telling you that what YOU PERSONALLY think is reasonable (as someone who, I have to assume, has never suffered from PPD) has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on OPs wife\u2019s recovery. The fact that you think that two months without recovery means the treatment isn\u2019t working really demonstrates that you don\u2019t have enough information or experience to be offering OP advice.\n\nI have friends who were in treatment for *over two years* before they felt \u201cok\u201d again after having their babies. There is no singular timeline for recovery. Often times the goal of treatment is to quite literally reduce the incidence of suicidal ideation, and any treatment that makes the patient feel *less like dying* is doing it\u2019s job.\n\nDo I think it\u2019s reasonable for OPs wife to threaten divorce if he goes to the wedding? Probably not. But that\u2019s sort of like, the whooooole deal with PPD\u2014it can profoundly disrupt logical thinking. It can make unreasonable emotional reactions feel inevitable.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t say if his wife has confessed suicidal ideation to him. If that is part of her PPD package, however, I would have a pretty easy time understanding why the idea of being *home alone with the baby for 5 days* made her go straight to the nuclear threat."]}
