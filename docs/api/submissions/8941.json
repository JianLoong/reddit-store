I started working less hours so I can be with them both more often and that\u2019s been helping.\n\nSince our son was born, we have not been away from him once. We have not had a break. Not even having his grandparents watch him while we get a night. My wife will not allow it. She doesn\u2019t want to be away from him at all. So much she doesn\u2019t even want to use the bathroom with him out of her eyesight. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve been dying for a break. Going to work then being on daddy duty without even one night to ourselves has been exhausting. My youngest sister got engaged about a year ago and her wedding is in 2 months. We already planned on attending but since the birth my wife has been against this. She doesn\u2019t want us to go as it\u2019s a destination wedding and we\u2019d likely have to leave for at least 5 days without our son.\n\nMy feeling is that we need to go. This is my family and it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event for her and I know it would deeply hurt her if we did not attend. It also would be good for both of us to get a short break. It may even do some work for her mental health.\n\nLast weekend I made it a priority for us to have a full conserverait about this. I told her my feelings and suggested that we give our son to her parents for a short while so we can go.\n\nShe was livid. She said I was prioritizing my wants over my obligations as a father and I can just drop our son anytime I want to do something fun. She said that I can go but she will be \u201ctoo busy being a parent to come with\u201d and that if I go I better find a place to different place to stay when I come back.\n\nThis made me feel guilty but I\u2019m really not sure if it should. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be a bad dad for wanting to see my siblings wedding.

Make sure there is someone staying with your wife and child to support her. \n\nThe first time your wife is away from the baby should be a short coffee run, a block away from home- not almost an entire week at a destination wedding. If she\u2019s not ready to use the bathroom without Baby in her sight, she certainly isn\u2019t ready to hop on a plane and be able to play the role of \u201cdestination wedding guest\u201d", "NAH For me it was postpartum anxiety, so not the exact same thing.  One of the things I was counseled to do was have small outings without my baby to get used to things going well while I was gone.  Is it possible to take her parents with you?  I may be worth the cost to fund them coming if it makes a little progress. Give her a short time without the little person at the wedding, perhaps pop back to the hotel to see the little one and then decide if she can handle the reception? Talk to her doctors and therapist who are helping with the PPD before setting this up, but they can help navigate exactly this sort of thing.", "NAH. Five days is a long time for a new mother to be away from her child. My wife would absolutely never agreed to this as well (although she wouldn't have yelled at me about it). There are so many fears with a first child and to go from constantly together to nearly a week apart is probably too much for her.\n\nEdit: I also think leaving on her own for 5 days is also really rough. I'd try to reduce the days gone to 3 max. Like there are clearly other ideas that could be discussed.", "Info\n\nCould your wife go and stay with her parents or have them come visit while you go to the wedding?\n\nIf she is suffering from PPD it may be too much for her to go at this time. You could go and she could get help with the baby.\n\n\nEditing to add: \n\nNAH\n\nI understand you wanting to be there for your sister and it totally makes sense. However, your wife is suffering, which means your family is suffering and I cannot call her an AH while experiencing PPD.\n\nMaybe try to talk again. Tell her you love her and want to be there for her while she is healing. Let her know you really want to go to your sisters wedding. Ask her what ideas she has for all of you to go (bringing someone, etc) or what would she need for you to be able to go? \n\nI hope you can make it work and if you can\u2019t, maybe a visit with your sister after  your wife is in a better place.", "Okay... NAH?\n\nYou guys do need a break. But 5 days is a long time to be away from a child that is less than a year old. If it was close by, you would absolutely not be TA. But it's a destination wedding and that's super stressful for a parent, especially one that is filled with PPD and anxiety.\n\nI do have a suggestion, though. Can't it be possible for you to bring your in-laws with you for the sole purpose of helping and watching the baby during the rehearsal, wedding, and reception. Your wife can then check on the baby whenever she wants, and you have childcare so you can relax and have a break, and the baby wouldn't be separated from mom for 5 whole days. That sounds reasonable to me.", "NAH\n\nYou definitely deserve this break AND to celebrate your sister's marriage with her.\n\nIf your wife is dealing with PPD, this isn't about her being an a-hole, this is about her needing and getting treatment (even if already in place). You also need a support system in this.\n\nThis isn't \"normal\" but being in the right doesn't get you, her or your son anywhere.", "INFO: Why does attending the wedding \"likely\" mean leaving your son behind at home for 5 days?\n\nUpdated based on OP's comment that he \"thinks it's better\" to leave the baby home (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10rsiu4/comment/j6y6s8w/ ): YTA. Your reasons for wanting to travel to the wedding and leave the baby home are no more rational or objective than your wife's reasons for wanting anything but that. It's not inherently irresponsible to leave an infant with trusted caretakers for five days, but there are plenty of relaxed, not depressed, not paranoid parents who would not be comfortable with that.\n\nI don't think the threat that you'll have to stay somewhere else if you go to the wedding was a great move on your wife's part, but IMO we're not in E S H territory because she was responding (while already not in good mental health) to you telling her what \"we\" need to do. If you had said, \"it's really important to me to attend my sister's wedding, can we talk about what options we have to pull that off?\" and she responded that way, she might be an AH, but that's not how it went. I'm a pretty chill mom of an infant (11 months) and I don't have PPD or any other type of depression, but I have not been ready to spend a night away from the baby yet and I would not respond well to someone just announcing that I needed to do that now (five nights in a row!) because they said so.", "Is she getting therapy for her PDD? Is she on meds? Is this something that can be tackled in therapy sessions? Its not acceptable if she isnt.\n\nCan her parents move in whilst you are gone?", "Nta\n\nBut given your wife's attitude, you need counseling ***NOW***. As in, *right now*. **Asap**.\n\nIf she's going to continue to be like this then she'll wreck the marriage in no time.", "I want to say NAH. 5 days is a long time to a new mother to leave her baby. Is she breastfeeding? If so, it\u2019s going to be difficult for her to have enough milk for him. I get you need a break, but your wife does too. She went through 9 months carrying your son, then gave birth to him and is now recovering. It\u2019s been rougher on her than you probably know. No shame on wanting a break. Could you take your son with you? Or could you maybe do 3 days away instead of 5? Find some sort of compromise?", "NAH.  PPD is T A.  She does need counseling ASAP and perhaps medication, too.  I would really work with her to see there is a compromise that works for you both.  I do think that five days away from your shared child is a stretch at this point, and if she's nursing, it's close to impossible.  \n\nI feel for you.  Mental illness is super-sneaky that way, because people look and seem \"able-bodied,\" but this is really no different than if she had chemo or just needed major surgery.  It's a condition that needs accommodating.", "NTA\n\nBecoming a parent doesn\u2019t mean that you cease to be a person nor does it mean you stop having other family obligations. I also hope that your wife is seeking treatment and is processing her feelings with a therapist. While there might be compromises between not going and leaving the baby with her parents for five day, the crux is that your wife isn\u2019t coping in a healthy manner and yes, new parents need breaks and need to continue to foster their relationship with each other.", "INFO: How long is the flight?\n\nI'm pretty sure either N T A or N A H is the judgement, but unless it's the other side of the world then I say just take the kid with you. If it is long, any way you could stagger the flights with layovers in other countries?\n\nAlso consider having support from yours or her family whilst out there.", "NAH. This is an acute situation. Expecting your wife, midst mental health crisis, to have a completely reasonable and understanding response to a challenging situation isn't going to happen. Also, unfortunately, this isn't the time to travel to a destination wedding.", "NAH\n\nThough you are being a bit inconsiderate by trying to force your wife to do something when you know she can not control her feelings right now(as illogical as they may seem)\n\nYour wife needed to be in therapy MONTHS ago to start dealing with this.  Just dropping 5 days away in her lap is too much too soon, when you have not even been able to get her to leave the baby for a few HOURS with someone you both trust.", "NTA.\n\nBut why can't you take your son with you? Five days is a long time? Would it be possible to bring your MIL with you? So she could watch your son on the day of the wedding but when you came back to the hotel, your wife can still spend time with the child.", "NAH. your wants are reasonable since being a parent to a newborn is exhausting. She's obviously having a hard time separating from the baby but as a mother that is completely justifiable. You're allowed to want to see your sister get married as that is an extremely important event. Your wife's feelings are justified because not wanting to leave the baby is very anxiety provoking. I recommend having a consultation with a doctor and maybe forming a plan that would make both of you comfortable leaving the baby as long as its safe to do so.", "NTA.\n\nIs she getting any professional help? She definitely needs it. This is not healthy. If she is not getting professional help, make sure you know you are doing this because you love her and want her at her best. Good luck with that.\n\nAs to the wedding, I would personally make it my hill to die on. If your wife will not see reason and will not seek the help she needs, you will need your family for support. If she makes this a bigger problem, separate and get legal custody (at least to the greatest extent possible, a father will virtually always get at least 50/50 if he pursues it. Your son will need a healthy parent in his life.", "Eesh. I'm gonna say NAH (but only just, definitely NTA on your part) You should be able to go to your sister's wedding. She shouldn't be forced to go if she doesn't want to, but telling you to find somewhere else to live after is ... \ud83d\ude2c much (this is leaning towards shes the AH just a bit). PPD/A is serious, yes, but it sounds like she's not coping very well. Is she seeing a therapist for it? What professional help is she getting because she either needs to start or whatever she's getting isn't working.", "This is a tough one.

She can get help from her parents. \n\nUsing her logic once you have kids you never attend weddings. That's ridiculous. \n\nYou need counseling to address this. She seems to be in a mental health crisis and you need a professional to help you navigate these waters.", "YTA. Your wife has PPD and doesn\u2019t want to leave the baby, so your solution is to make her leave the baby for 5 days?\n\nDude. Does she have a therapist? Or do you guys have a couples counselor? You might need help discussing this. However, even without PPD, it is completely normal that a parent wouldn\u2019t want to leave their infant for that long. If she\u2019s breastfeeding, that\u2019s even more reason. \n\nCould you go for 2-3 days and have someone else stay with your wife, that she would be comfortable with? \n\nAlso, people who have destination weddings should be prepared for those with young children to not be there.", "ESH. 5 days is way way too long to leave a 9 month old anyone that isn\u2019t his parents.

Does she have a therapist?\n\nFive days is a huge ask for someone who has trouble leaving their kid out of sight even for minutes. But no breaks isn't doable either.\n\nSit down again, find some kind of compromise.

Maybe you go with her blessing and her parents stay with her to help.", "Need more info.  Have her parents agreed to watch your baby for 5 days? Are they capable and responsible? (No offense intended -- some grandparents are too old to manage a baby).\n\nIf responsible child care is lined up and your son is not breastfeeding, then NTA.  If your wife is still nursing, it is a big hassle to pump for 5 days to maintain her supply.  \n\nIf your wife refuses to travel, I would absolutely not leave her alone with the baby given that you say she is suffering from severe postpartum depression.  \n\nIt is important for you and your wife to get a break from 24/7 baby care -- at least a good night's sleep.  Maybe you can work up to this by having your inlaws watch your  baby for a few hours during the day and then see about an overnight break.", "NTA. You are not unreasonable or a bad parent for wanting to go support and celebrate your sister for 5 days. Your child will not be damaged by being cared for by other loving people. \n\nYour wife is also not unreasonable to want to stay with her child and to prefer not to go. I didn\u2019t sleep away from my kids for almost two years after they were born. It was just too stressful for me and I couldn\u2019t have any fun, so what was the point of forcing it? We did day trips/date nights, but not overnights. I do wish we\u2019d done overnights earlier in hindsight because they had a harder time with it starting in the clingy toddler years. \n\nBut, this isn\u2019t an N A H situation because she is telling you that you\u2019re awful for not feeling the same way as she does, to the point that she doesn\u2019t want you to come back if you go. That\u2019s not fair or reasonable at all, and it worries me a lot. \n\nThe easy solution here is for you to go, because everyone gets to do thing thing that feels right to them with no real downsides other than the distance for 5 days, and yet that seems unforgivable to her.

A destination wedding of 5 days is a HUGE ask though at that young age. Especially with no test of how baby and grandparents will do. Why can't baby go with you to the wedding?

How you respond in this period of your wife\u2019s life will stay with her forever. She is ILL. She needs your help and support, and needs you to understand that leaving her baby for five days to go far away from her baby is not going to help her get better. Neither is you leaving her alone to deal with her depression and an infant- this is a potentially unsafe situation if her treatment is not yet helping her. \n\nPeople who choose to have destination weddings need to accept that not everyone will be able to attend.

I would suggest OP makes time to do things with wife and baby too so she doesn\u2019t feel she\u2019s stuck in a hotel/Airbnb the whole time. That\u2019s what we did. Days were spent seeing the city with our friend tagging along and evenings were spent on wedding events.\n\nETA: even if you take someone to babysit, it likely won\u2019t be anxiety free for your wife, OP, so you\u2019d need to manage expectations. I could only be away from my baby a few hours, so I didn\u2019t stay for the entire reception or go out with people afterward. I checked my phone the whole night. Our Airbnb was in a high rise condo building and I had debilitating thoughts of my baby flying off the balcony or out a window. PPA/PPD makes it impossible to enjoy anything because you feel like you can\u2019t know for certain your baby is safe.", "I agree with the NAH judgement. I also think asking a trusted family member to come along will help. \n\nI suffered from severe PPA and moderate PPD when my son was born, so I understand how your wife may be feeling right now. I felt like a the biggest failure as a mom, but at the same time felt no one could care for my son except me, it\u2019s not an easy state of mind to be in. \n\nWhat helped was having some trusted family members be available to care for my son so I could get a break (because believe me, your wife does need a break). The trusted family members needed to respect my boundaries and let me be a little controlling with my son\u2019s schedule. My SIL and mom were both great during this time, and my mom even came to Hawaii with us for 2 weeks so she could babysit while we went out. \n\nI still have some anxiety, but I\u2019m much better than I was. Consider attending a therapy session with your wife (as long as she and the therapist are ok with this) to work out some solutions for attending the wedding. I hope you\u2019re both able to come up with a plausible solution!", "And an extra option to add OP:\nIf you want to go (and I get why, it is your sisters wedding) you could ask someone (or multiple people) to stay with your wife and baby at home. Dragging your wife there is going to add to her trauma and might result in a break down or set back. She would not have a good time at the wedding. If she wants to stay home she should. Maybe you can hire a nanny or night watch to make sure everything is fine and ask other friends and family to check on her so you don\u2019t have to worry about her and your baby.", "Nobody is calling the wife TA for her over the top not to mention hurtful reaction? She said he can choose between keeping his marriage and going to his sister\u2019s wedding. She\u2019s TA 100%. PPD is no excuse to go nuclear, especially since OP did nothing but shared his feelings.", "Just replying because it's top comment. My sister had really bad post partum depression. The best thing she did was go back to work. She didn't need to work by any means but she got a little part time job and she was immediately so much happier, it gave her some space and my neice has amazing social skills which may be down to her being in nursery since she was 6 months. But I genuinely think that job saved my sisters life. Maybe OPs wife needs an outlet.", "NTA and I think having someone come along to help with the baby is a fantastic idea!!", "Agree with all of this. NAH. Your wife clearly isn\u2019t ready and continuing to pressure her is probably a bad idea. You should be able to go to your sisters wedding though. Arranging someone like her family to stay with her while you\u2019re gone would be a good call. Or taking baby with you. If you can\u2019t afford to take a caregiver your wife could even skip the wedding events and just be there together. Maybe by that time she\u2019d be ready to do an evening just the two of you if your family was willing and able to watch baby and you\u2019re within the same hotel. Good luck.", "Totally agree. I think it's important to recognise also though that:\n\n1.OP's mental health is equally important as his wife's mental health and he's stated repeatedly that he *needs* a break.\n\n2. Not attending the wedding could have a lifelong negative impact on his relationships with his family. He not only needs the break but he needs to attend his sisters wedding.\n\nI like your compromise of him making it a shorter trip (if possible, the 5 days might be a day to travel, a day to recover, a day for the wedding, family brunch the next day and recover from wedding, a day to travel home) and having someone stay with his wife so that she's not caring for the baby alone.\n\nThat said, this seems like an incredibly severe case of PP separation anxiety and I do wonder what treatment and therapies OPs wife is receiving.\n\nI had severe PP separation anxiety due to a traumatic birth, which involved my baby and I almost dying. I didn't sleep for months because I **needed** to check on her every 10 minutes and make sure she was breathing. Treatment and quite extensive therapy helped and by the baby was 7 months old I was in a much better place (not fully, but better than I was). \n\nSo this is a bigger issue than just one destination wedding. OPs wife seems to be needing more mental health support than she's getting. Still not being able to use the bathroom without the baby in sight doesn't seem as though much progress has been made. Medication is trial and error, and finding the right therapy and therapist can take time.\n\nI'd suggest that OP focus on helping his wife to find the best possible treatment and care for herself, while making it clear that his mental health matters too and he needs to attend this wedding.", "Agreed. I had really bad postpartum anxiety and hated being away from my son. He goes to preschool now 2 days a week for 2.5 hours. I cried like a baby when I dropped him off the first time. I've never left him overnight and have no plans to do so any time soon. The thought fills me with extreme panic. It's even worse with an infant.

I had to have my 8 week old baby (my firstborn) taken away from me (planned) for a week while I was hospitalised, my partner had to work so my newborn had to stay with my parents 110 miles away. It was the hardest week of my life. The pain and stress of my illness was absolutely nothing compared to the emotional pain of being separated from my child. My entire body was just screaming for my baby, and not being able to hold her was torture. I developed separation anxiety around my children (though it is *extremely* mild today), and I needed to know exactly where they were at all times and be within at least the same building as them. I think taking a baby away from their mother for the first time is something that needs to be built up to gradually, not just a sudden 5 day separation.\n\n\nEdit: for everyone saying I need help, I have been getting help from a therapist since my hospital discharge. I'm currently doing really well, and was talking mostly from past tense. At the time this occured I only had the one child, who was 8 weeks old. I have two children now, but over the years my symptoms have become so mild they are unnoticeable unless I choose to talk about them. Both of my children are under the age of five and I was using my own story to say that a sudden separation of mum and baby is traumatic, and more often than not, it is underestimated. None of my children are traumatised, so unnecessary comments like that are not appreciated, and actually come across as quite hostile. While I had anxiety I also had self control, so I was well aware of limiting my behaviours and not forcing toxic boundaries onto my children.

Part of successful therapy is putting into practice the tools you are given. If the wife can't even go to the bathroom without the baby she has serious issues. Taking small steps of leaving the baby and working up to going on the trip will be a great opportunity for the wife to work on dealing her anxiety.\n\nRight now, she is putting her anxiety # 1, not the baby. The baby will be best served by having mentally healthy, happy parents, who have a good relationship. Them going away and having time together not dominated by child care responsibilities will be good for their relationship if she is able to do it.

I think OP cavalierly suggesting they spend 5 full days away from a baby that will be 9 months old is a bit of an AH move too though. That's a lot of time to spend away from a baby that young.

But it's more for the way OP is framing and thinking about everything rather than the actions themselves. \n\nClose to a week away from an infant at 9 months can be done responsibly. Making the plan 2 months out before you've even had a single successful overnighter is not responsible planning.

He needs a break. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity (for him). He would look bad if he didn't go. It's not a good look and I judge him for it. \n\nObjectively, and this is what I was trying to convey, what she said was worse. In a bubble if a third party had explained their actions I'd have said hers were worse, because everything you said is correct.

She really should talk to her doctor and maybe a therapist. That level of anxiety over her husband wanting to do something very reasonable is also concerning.

Especially to the degree that you can\u2019t gather that your wife would *never* leave her child for 5 days straight and it would set her off massively to attempt to press the issue.

It\u2019s not her fault, either - she literally had PPD and is (hopefully) being treated for it. If they haven\u2019t gotten to this part in her therapy, it\u2019s likely because they\u2019re focusing on other, more important things that negatively effect her daily functioning. Now this doesn\u2019t mean that this doesn\u2019t effect her daily functioning negatively, but I can easily see there being other, bigger problems. \n\nThere are a lot of parents that don\u2019t do daycare - even low income ones - simply because daycare costs more than one parent\u2019s wages. And I say that as a preschool teacher. \n\nSaying that they shouldn\u2019t been preparing for the wedding for the past year - when they were 4 months pregnant - means nothing. That all goes flying out the window when the baby gets there. Some wedding that\u2019s 9 months away? You don\u2019t think about that daily. You\u2019re just trying to survive.

I\u2019m telling you that what YOU PERSONALLY think is reasonable (as someone who, I have to assume, has never suffered from PPD) has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on OPs wife\u2019s recovery.

The realization of what she did came the next morning when she couldn\u2019t find her baby & called 911. It was a horrendous sight. \n\nOne woman put hers in the oven and when her husband came home she said dinner was ready and served up her newborn to her husband. He flipped out demanding to know where their baby was.  He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. She told him \u201cdon\u2019t be silly we don\u2019t have any kids\u201d. She had no recollection of having a baby or being at home w their baby. She was child free and interviewing her was like talking to a woman who did not have kids. Even showing her pictures w her holding her baby she said that was a friends baby. She was as calm as she could be and so confused about what was going on. She woke in the hospital remembering what she did and tried to kill her self. \n\nJust this last week a mother close to our home town had a baby. She had 2 other small children under 4. The husband went to get them food and was gone less than 30 minutes and she strangled all 3 babies to death. She had no recollection she did it. Husband came back and found all 3 dead. When he asked her about it she realized what she had done and tried to kill her self out of guilt but failed. She\u2019s currently in the hospital in a coma and if she wakes she faces life either in prison or psychiatric hospital for life. \n\nPPD is pure hell and the mothers who have it are very unpredictable.

She has a fear of something happening to the baby. She doesn\u2019t want to leave him for fear of something happening. She doesn\u2019t anyone babysitting because she fears someone will hurt him or take him etc etc. But you\u2019re arguing w her to take a break and go on a 5 day vacation?\n\nWe were still in the hospital from birth and my wife went to take a shower. When she came in the room and saw me holding our baby girl she asked \u201cwho\u2019s that baby and why are you breast feeding her?\u201d I was holding her and tracing my finger around her beautiful little face , touching her ears & nose etc. She got angry that I took someone\u2019s baby. I explained she was ours and what I was doing. She played it off as a joke and I should have caught on to it but I had no clue what was going on.

I understand you need a break but a 5 day trip without your not even 1 year old son is NOT the answer. Your wife is still anxious about leaving him long enough to use the bathroom so that suggestion was probably very triggering to her. As a mom who likely had mild ppa myself I would NEVER have left my son with someone else overnight before a year old. He\u2019s almost 2 and I still stress about if I need to be gone overnight for any reason. When my baby was 6 months old my husband\u2019s cousin got married 5 hours drive away.

Your wife is seriously struggling, and your baby will too if its separated from her for 5 days having never gone without her. You can, make it a short trip (3 days instead of 5), bring your wife and baby along, but tell your wife she doesn't have to attend the wedding or all that crap, she can literally just come to the hotel / place with the baby and do her own thing. It might even be reasonable to bring her mom or someone she trusts with the baby along on the destination. If her anxiety is as bad as not being able to see baby while using the rest room, you will definitely have to start slower, and start now if you want her to even be able to leave the child for even an hour. Start with maybe having her go to a separate room for 5-10 min while you play with the child. I get it, parenting is hard. The reality is \"mom\" duty, is on all day, all night... there is no turning off switch, and certainly not if she has ppd / ppa. So while you go to work and be \"off dad duty\", she is still on. Her mental state is unwell, so she can't \"turn off\" mom duty even if she wanted to. I would suggest even just going for a day, cut that vacation down, or bring her along so she can do her own thing with the babe. That is a long time at 9 mo and I think its extremely unfair and unreasonable for you to expect her to be able to leave an infant for so long, especially if she's bf. She did say some hurtful things to you, and she honestly probably regrets them. You both need to cut each other some slack right now.

This may help her and also help you in the long run to get that much needed break.\n\nBreaks are so essential, but I wouldn\u2019t push this any further without hurting your wife and relationship. \n\nA compromise is that you go and she perhaps goes to her parents but, she needs to know she\u2019s supported at her parents as if you were there. If she\u2019s struggling with you there, I suspect it would be a whole new level of difficulty to do it without you. \n\nOr could you go for 1-2 days only?

I know you\u2019re both struggling, the first year is so so hard, and it sounds like you both desperately need a break. I would start slowly, asking a family member to watch the baby for an hour for a weekend lunch date. You taking the baby while she goes for a walk or out on her own. You need to get her comfortable with being away for small amounts of time before a night (or nights) away. And this is something YOU need to plan, don\u2019t ask! Have the babysitter show up and then tell her to get ready for the date, prepare her workout clothes on the bed or plan a spa day. Run the bath and take the baby out while she relaxes. If the onus is on her to both plan and execute time away from the baby it won\u2019t happen. And I need to add that this will not be feasible in the two months before the wedding to allow you both to attend without the baby. \n\nAs for the wedding, I agree with other commenters that you should bring someone along whose sole purpose is to watch the baby while you two attend the wedding. Or you\u2019ll just have to deal with attending as a family of 3. If this is not feasible I really do think you need to reconsider going. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair, no but that\u2019s parenthood sometimes. I think if you go alone for 5 whole days it will destroy your marriage.

She cannot rely on him for 100% support, there need to be others involved so that nobody burns out. If he burns out, she loses all support. This is the exact reason respite exists for caregivers.

She will have plenty of chances to take an hour break or something while her husband watches the baby. Or ya know, bathe. Because if she's struggling to use the bathroom alone, I can almost promise you she's not showering. I think the ultimatum was uncalled for, but I also think it was a cry for help. NTA.\n\nETA: read more of OP's comments. He's not willing to compromise with her at all. He is firm on leaving their baby with her parents for a week. YTA OP.\n\nETA2: If the grandparents have had ZERO time with this child, you will effectively be leaving them with strangers (in the eyes of the child). They're old enough to know that mom and dad are gone. They're old enough to have those abandoned feelings. OP you're delusional. Everyone is worried about the actions of the mother here...and is she breastfeeding too? I feel like that hasn't been answered yet, and it's a pretty important question. Y T A.", "Typo. 100% was my intent", "I was suicidal, thought my kid wasn't actually mine and that I was clearly an imposter or a nanny, and I started hallucinating.\n\nMy ex husband told me to get over myself and stop being difficult.\n\nThankfully, my doctor noticed how fucked up I was at my PP checkup and immediately got me medicated.  Otherwise, I'd probably have offed myself.", "I totally felt like that as well. In some ways I was fortunate because I have bipolar disorder so I\u2019m very cognizant that my mind isn\u2019t always right and I just did \u201cfake it until you make it\u201d for sooo long with parenting my baby. I always thought of him in my head as my husband\u2019s baby for like the whole first year.", "Me too. I still remember sitting on our bedroom floor, sobbing and begging him to take our newborn and raise her with another woman. I can\u2019t even imagine what was happening in his head.", "People ignore caregiver burnout because they don't believe it's a thing, not until they deal with it themselves.", "My mom had postpartum psychosis following a miscarriage.\nI just remember coating my clothes with sap of a plant we were both allergic to, so she couldn't touch me.\n\nIt hurt, and I got welts from where the sap leaked through the cloth, but I was 5 and it was all I could think of.  My dad acted like it was a joke when he got home. Like if he pretended hard enough he could make it so that the sap was on my clothes because I was careless and not because I was afraid.\n\nLuckily that passed and my mom recovered.  Once she was herself again, she didn't even remember the things she did while psychotic, which is apparently pretty common for people who suffer from that.\n\nIt makes it hard sometimes, because she's my mom and she loves me so much, but she's also featured in my nightmares for a very long time for very good reasons.", "which is why she needs to get proper help. it is unfair to husband to give everything and slowly burn at both ends just to make sure his wife does not harm herself or their child. relationships require giving up a bit of personal freedom and preference to be healthy. Husband has clearly shown that he is willing to be there for his wife - but wife is diagnosed with PPD and not seeking help from professionals, instead choosing to threaten husband for not throwing himself in the fire as well. i don't expect any major changes in 2 months, but it's clear wife needs a support network that extends beyond just husband.", "If I had a friend in that situation, I would pack up myself for a week and go stay with her so the husband to go to the wedding.  Like OP's wife is being massively unreasonable.  And I'm not going to lie, if OP was my brother and missed my wedding because of his wife, I would never forgive either of them.", "That would be a very good start at least. She has already been diagnosed, yet no mention of any kind of therapy.", "Yes, she definitely needs PPD care.  I didn't see a mention from OP if she's getting any kind of outside therapy?  It doesnt' sound like it.", "Well, she'd get some real separation anxiety when he gets 50/50, or even just weekends.", "For real, I'm thinking back to all the times my inlaws watched our kids for a date night or the whole weekend and I don't think either kids was older than 3 months when it first happened.", "Same. We\u2019re still having a marriage. And that relationship needs to be prioritized so that when the kids are gone you remember why you were together in the first place. We adore our kids, but we enjoy our time alone and they benefit from having close relationships with their grandparents.", "It is kind of weird how many Americans will not spend a night away from their kids. Our daughters are 6 and my wife and I have left them with our respective parents for a week at a time when my wife go away for some needed alone time. It\u2019s how we keep our marriage centered. But of the families that we know, we are the only one that do something like that. We know one family that won\u2019t even do a babysitter, in 7 years they have not had a date night.", "Some of these comments are really out there.", "Fr. My mom got a month before she had to be back working 12hr days 6/7 days a week. Not that I don't think that was ridiculous, and she deserved more time than that, but...  Whenever I see people talk like this I *have* to assume they're upper middle class SAHMs. Plenty of women leave their babies with others regularly.", "My parents *literally* never spent a night away from us until we went to college. They didn\u2019t even do date night, they\u2019d do a date afternoon. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll do date nights and leave my kids with my parents for an evening, but not overnight. My kids are 6 and 2.5. Were planning a weekend trip a few hours away for my birthday and I\u2019m both excited and slightly dreading it.", "Our first trip away from our oldest was when he was 18 months. He stayed with his grandparents. It's not healthy for couples to never be away from their children. We had regular date night starting every month when he was about a year old.", "Everyone is different, this is personal preference, upbringing and so many different things at play.\n\nJust because it's nuts to you doesn't mean it's nuts to everyone.", "The baby will only be 9 months old at the time of the wedding.  That\u2019s still a bit young for a 5-day absence.", "I mean, I was breastfeeding.  My baby pretty much rejected bottles with extended screaming fits instead.  Being away from my baby would have meant my baby screaming at someone for several hours a day before eventually probably taking a bottle and not actually ending up in the hospital for dehydration.  Hopefully.  I never actually had to try it.  \n\nMeanwhile, I'd have to spend 6-8 hours of time pumping per day away; 30 minutes 6-8x per day to save enough milk to leave behind, and then 30 minutes 6-8x per day while gone.  Plus all the logistics around transporting the milk and having a spot to pump everywhere.\n\nI was happy to leave my kids overnight and eventually for short trips with a trusted caregiver who they were comfortable with after they weaned and were a bit older.", "It\u2019s just so they can tell people how they\u2019re better parents who love their kids more lol", "Its pretty normal in my culture for kids to be raised by grandparents. But usually parents/ extended family all live nearby. It's very \"it takes a village\" type of culture, but my parents immigrated to the US for school when my mom got pregnant.\n\nMy mom expected to do the same with my kids, but I'm the same as you I was like no way am I separating with my kids for that long (or living with my mom for that long). Sorry mom, you can babysit for a weekend if you want.", "My mom wasn\u2019t allowed to see me and my twin for 3 days because we were premature and she developed a fever. A nurse took pity on her and brought our little incubators by her door so she could look at us.", "I know right,.grandma and grandpa are taking my 3 yr old for a week this year. I'll be vigilant but relieved for a break.", "Him having to work fewer hours is very concerning. What is going to happen if he loses his job and can\u2019t provide? It\u2019s likely going to be even more difficult to find a new job with this type of flexibility.", "It was a long journey, but I'm super proud of how far I've come now \u263a\ufe0f", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Yes something is wrong. Good grief so none of y\u2019all know what postpartum depression is? Y\u2019all are basing her reactions as I\u2019d she doesn\u2019t have a mental illness. PPD is hell and dangerous if not treated. If she has a diagnosis of PPD then she\u2019s getting help.", "I do agree with your 100% on that comment, but I\u2019m giggling at the idea of intentionally commenting 0% on someone else\u2019s comment.", "Thank god he is an ex and thank god your doctor figured out what was wrong!", "I suffered from depression prior to pregnancy, and my therapist advised me of the increased risk of PPD after baby was born. I had 0 clue that I had PPA as I didn't know what it would manifest as. Apparently, being obsessively worried my baby was going to die is how it pop up. Luckily, thanks to all the crying (on my end) it made me realize that something wasn't right and I needed to get help.", "Oh it is. I watched it happen to my husband when I got sick. And he\u2019s the last person I think anyone would expect to see that happen to. It can happen to anyone and it usually does happen.", "We had our daughter on a plane when she was 3 months old, to move to South America. I had to leave her multiple times throughout that year. I missed her, but also I enjoyed being baby free", "Exactly. It\u2019s not as though grandparents have no experience with babies.", "Exactly, couldn\u2019t agree more.", "The first time I left my little son he was 4 months old. There was a really terrible relationship with my big son's (stepson's) biological mother, just super toxic and not healthy. We had to drive 12 hours on Christmas Day to drop my big son off with her. He didn't want to go, the trip would be grueling, and she had a history of calling the cops / showing up with a group of family and friends for trumped-up or invented reasons. There was just no healthy way to mix a 4-month-old into that. \n\nEnter my mother-in-law, who successfully raised for wonderful sons to adulthood. She was visiting for the holidays, is a fantastic mom and a wonderful friend to me.\n\nDespite knowing that my husband and big son needed me more, and despite knowing that my mother-in-law had this whole thing under control in my absence, and despite the fact that this would be 36 hours at the most until I'm holding my baby again... I was crying and a nervous wreck. I made a list of all possible illness scenarios and medications and dosages. \n\nIn hindsight, that last bit was overkill. \n\nI blame the hormones a little, but mostly I think it was the deeply ingrained evolutionary trait of mothers being wildly protective of their offspring. It has successfully kept our species alive for a very long time now. Even when I had all necessary evidence and knowledge about the need of this separation and of my son's assured safety, I couldn't turn that switch off. \n\nIt's like knowing you're having a panic attack, and knowing that you don't NEED to panic, but you can't stop the panic attack.", "Like holy shit, did sleepovers not exist for a whole generation or am I fucking crazy?", "I really feel there\u2019s been huge cultural and generational shifts around this!\n\nWhen my grandmother was six she was sent to town to live with her grandparents, because she was struggling in the one room country school in her rural hometown. She saw her mom like twice in that first year. \n\nMy mom spent whole summers with her grandparents in the country so her mom could pick up more shifts at work. \n\nWhen I came along my mom thought nothing of leaving me with my grandparents for the summer from the time I was pretty small\u2014 like three\u2014 and I stayed with grandparents for the weekend from the time I was like six months. My folks would use that time to rest or work more to save money. \n\nNow me and my brother have kids and my mom gets upset sometimes because we just aren\u2019t willing to part with our very young kids for a weekend or longer. Partially it\u2019s because we don\u2019t need to on the same way- both me and my brothers wife got good maternity leave and have access to decent childcare, so by the time the weekend rolls around we really want to hang out with our kids.", "Maybe. Everyone has a different philosophy on child rearing, but some take it to the extreme", "Jesus Christ, I wasn\u2019t able to see my babygirl for like idk not quite 12 hours because she had to go to NICU from theatre and I\u2019m still not past it\u2026 three days would have broken me, man. That nurse had a good heart fr", "Enjoy. My daughter is 16 now, so we don\u2019t have these issues anymore, but the exhaustion of chasing and corralling a 3 year old is burned into my brain", "You should be proud. \u2764\ufe0f", "Why not? Especially since it seems like her parents are a viable support structure for her and their kids?", "Happened to me with my ex. Killed the relationship when she refused to get help and kept putting more and more and more on me, and I felt trapped.", "She is a Labor and Delivery nurse so she would be aware of PPD more than most people. It is such an incredibly terrible situation.", "Her insurance company should be culpable in this. Had they not denied her the appropriate treatment for her illness her children would be alive today.", "They didn\u2019t exist for certain people. \n\nMy parents were immigrants, they had zero trust in anyone close by. I think that even the night my sister was born, I stayed at my grandmother\u2019s but my dad actually came by after sis was born and slept on the couch there until I woke up and then took me over to meet her. Like, I did not spend 24 hours away from my parents until I went away to school.", "Cultural, I think. My grandmothers never spent time away from their kids either\u2026 one had 11 kids and never took a night away. The idea that I might want a night away is really *different.*", "This happens a lot in our rural areas as well. Children stay on the farms usually with grandparents and parents go work.", "I was away for 2 weeks....", "The minimum amount of time is probably 4 days unless there's a way to red-eye or early morning flight on the front end.  Being her brother, odds are he'll be wanted to participate in some part of the ceremony, so day 1: travel there, day 2: rehearsal, day 3: ceremony, day 4: travel home.", "I think the best case scenario is that they work on her being away from the baby for small bursts of time (2-3 hours) and take her parents with them to watch the baby during that amount of time. \n\nI think another solution might be him going 3 days (flight there, wedding, flight back) and hiring some help (maid, nanny) for those three days while she stays home.", "The feeling of \"Where did the time go? Where was I?\" when looking through their baby pictures/videos is already hitting hard. Adding \"I literally wasn't there and missed something I won't ever get back\" has to be an everlasting pain. Heck, even being there but not being able to really interact due to our girl being in an incubator left scars on me and my wife."]}
