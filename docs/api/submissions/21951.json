When my kids went for their summer time with their mom, they said to my stepkids not to watch the movie without them so they can all watch it together when they get back. My stepkids said okay. So a couple weeks ago my wife said to her sons that she would take them to go see the movie while her daughter was at ballet. My stepsons said they didn't want to go, because they promised they would wait, which I thought was sweet.\n\nMy wife said that wasn't a reasonable request, and she was offering to take them, so they don't have to wait, but the boys insisted they didn't want to go without their sister or my sons. My wife was annoyed and said they could stay home and do nothing then. I ended up taking the boys to get ice cream, which my wife was very upset about, because she said it's not right to take the boys to get ice cream but not her daughter. I said I was rewarding them for being thoughtful, and she said that I wasn't, that I was rewarding them for being disrespectful.\n\nAnyway, my kids got back Saturday, so I said I would take all five to the cinema to watch this movie. My wife said no, that she didn't want to go to the movies that night because she was tired. I said we'd just go without her, and she said no again, but I took all the kids anyway. She said I'm wrong for overriding her with her kids, that they aren't my kids, and it's not my place. I said the kids waited all this time to see the movie, so they earned it.

Yeah, NTA. She\u2019s a giant AH.\n\nStart planning your escape. There\u2019s a reason the first (?) guy left. I suspect you\u2019re finding out too.", "NTA\n\nYour title is misleading. The kids want to bond together and the other adult just wanted to do whatever she wanted.", "NTA - I don't think the kids were disrespectful, and its lovely that they want to do things with their step siblings meaning they see them as true family which is brilliant. I do feel sorry the daughter missed out on a fun ice cream trip, however the boys deserved a reward for sticking to their word and being thoughtful.", "NTA\n\nYour kids agreed to watch the film together. They stuck to that. Actually commendable.\n\nFeels like your wife just wanted them to not watch the film together which just makes me confused as to why?", "NTA.\n\n>the boys insisted they didn't want to go without their sister or my sons. My wife was annoyed and said they could stay home and do nothing then.\n\nYour wife had a needlessly antagonistic response to this. I find parents / people who are this angry at a perceived lack of appreciation/gratitude to be really draining and frankly it's teaching the kids the wrong thing. They were PUNISHED for wanting to uphold their word, and for honoring the wishes of their step siblings. It's very sad to me that your wife chose to see disrespect in this, and lacks respect herself for their bond. Was it really that hard for her to find something else to go do with them? It's especially odd that she wanted to extend this grudge and punishment several days later by trying to prevent the whole family from seeing this movie.\n\nIs your wife normally this petty and vengeful?  \n\n\nEDIT: Clarified references to 'them' being the kids.", "NTA\n\nWhy is your wife trying to create drama between all the children? The children aren't disrespecting her, she is disrespecting the mature agreement they all made. Is intentional sabotage of this blended family a common occurrence for her?", "NTA, there's no disrespect here from them.  Your wife however is disrespecting all the kids wishes because they all want to see it together.  A child not wanting to do an activity isn't being disrespectful.  Why does she think they were being disrespectful to her?  She has no grounds from what I can see.\n\nAlso taking the kids for ice-cream was a nice thing, daughter was at ballet so she was doing her own thing (plus would've been excluded from the cinema so it's a non-point.)\n\nMaybe a little bit not great for taking the kids on Saturday when your wife wanted to go too but was tired for that night... although it's Saturday night, how long are they supposed to wait?  If there's one reason she's not talking to you, it's this one night.\n\nOn her \"not your kids\" line... does she want a family or a fuck buddy?  Time to talk this through together... hopefully nicely.", "NTA. Your wife is choosing some very strange hills to die on. I like your step kids.", "So it was disrespectful for the boys to get ice cream while their sister was at basket, but it wasn't disrespectful to take the boys to see a movie while the sister was at ballet?  Your wife is petty AF.  NTA", "NTA.  How was that disrespectful?  If you excluded her out when she could have gone then sure.  Shes all about having control, not just over her own kids.

It\u2019s wonderful that all of the step kids get along so nicely! Why does your wife want to create conflict between them all? Most stepmothers want peacefulness at any cost, so this woman\u2019s antics not only are baffling but only serve to propagate the evil stepmother myth", "NTA.  You have a wife problem.  Why is she trying to sow dissent between the kids?", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re acting like the adult here, setting a good example of living up to promises and creating a sense of unity by shared experiences.

Please go through this thing you wrote and count how many times you vetoed her and just did what you wanted. I counted at least 6, possibly 7 times.\n\nBecause she has no power and no voice, she's going to start screaming and lashing out, even if she does it through the silent treatment or petty denials.\n\nYou guys need to get on the same page and realigned as a team.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That was kinda disrespectful but that was you and not the kids). The kids said they wanted to wait. There was nothing wrong with that.", "Nta", "When someone who has kids from another relationship gets married, it is not up to them to decided if their new husband/wife is a paternal figure, it is up to the kids. The kids love your children as their own siblings and they respect you enough as a paternal figure. She doesn't get to use the \"not your kids\" card here, as it is not up to her to decide that. NTA", "NTA but your wife sure is - You might want to think long and hard about that.  She is deliberately trying to cause resentment between the children and she is creating drama in the home.", "NTA. She is showing you her true colors. She wanted to favor her kids and she didn\u2019t like that they wanted to wait for your ex\u2019s kids. Her line about how her kids aren\u2019t yours seems similar to her not wanting your kids around for fun things", "It's wrong for you to take the boys to get ice cream without her daughter,but *not* wrong for her to take them to the movies without her? You're mostly NTA,it sounds like you're doing a good job of trying to foster positive relationships between you & all the kids. Her reaction in this situation is super odd imo,it sounds like she's either being needlessly controlling,or that she's insistent on being the,\"FUN parent\". She wants to be the one that takes them to the movies,she wants to be the one that takes them for ice cream,and she doesn't like when you're the one having those experiences with them instead.\n\n However,I do think it would have been better to wait until your wife was able to go with you all. Personally I think that was inappropriate,would it have hurt to have gone the next day instead? The whole thing started because the kids wanted to go together as a family and not have anyone miss out,so why make mum miss out? She was being weird about this to start with,but going without her wasn't cool,and is the sort of thing that builds resentment in the long run.", "NTA - Is this a control thing with her? Is she actively TRYING to make the kids all hate each other? And blaming YOU for being the one to reward them being good, honest people, instead of doing what their shady mother demanded and tried to punish them for???\n\nPlease get her into family and couples counseling.

How does punishing kids for being thoughtful for their other siblings benefit anyone other than the mother's ego?\n\nHow were the actions of the father (other than the fatal mistake of disagreeing with his wife) incorrect?\n\nEffectively she was punishing the children for made-up offenses; is her voice being silenced or is she being prevented from harming the familial relationships?"]}
