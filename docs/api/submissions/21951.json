The fact that she's not speaking to you indicates that she's pretty petty when it comes to \"my kids, your kids, our kids\"", "NTA but that \u201cnot your kids\u201d comment is a big red flag that you guys aren\u2019t United in her eyes bc you don\u2019t listen to her demands. I\u2019d run if I were you before you get deeper in the hole Step parents in general are either in it respectfully  co parenting , or not. She\u2019s the latter and it\u2019s only a matter of time before things escalate into more foolish arguments.", "I agree, this doesn\u2019t sound good. Not a well-blended family, at least your wife isn\u2019t. If the kids want to watch together, why would she try to force her sons not to wait? Seems unnecessarily mean. I don\u2019t get it.\n\nAlso the \u201cnot your kids\u201d card was cruel. Maybe you can all talk about this as a family? \n\nNTA, and good luck.", "Yes. The kids are holding a promise. The mother is way more childish than her kids.", "The wife was the one who would have been taking the kids to the movie if they went without the step-siblings. So that doesn't make sense with this scenario, she would have been out of the house at the movies.", "I read it more as she would have dropped them off at the movie, but that\u2019s definitely not the only read it on it by any means.", "I often wonder, do people not portray the awful side to themselves before marriage?\n\nYou should probably show her this, and from her reaction, you can make a decision on what to do next.", "NTA.\n\nSounds to me like your current wife is working on becoming your second ex-wife.\n\nEx-wife tried to pull a power trip on the kids by saying they needed to stay home and be bored because they weren't willing to go see the movie with her. That's why she was upset you took them out for ice cream.\n\nCurrent wife tried to pull a power trip and block you from taking all the kids to see the movie, hence the \"not your kids\" nonsense. Her being tired is a reasonable excuse for her not going with you. It's not a good reason to prevent the kids from seeing the movie.\n\nThe fact that both your ex and your current wife are power tripping should alarm you.", "Sounds like those are some awesome kids!\nNTA", "NTA", "Im so sick of people who think kids having their own opinions and decisions is \u201cdisrespect\u201d they\u2019re not slaves they\u2019re humans. NTA", "If my husband took our kids out without me I would be elated. Time to myself!!! Your wife has a problem. NTA", "Omg! I\u2019m so sorry to say but your wife has the maturity of my toddler, lmao. NTA obviously", "These kinds of posts should come with a flow chart to spell out exactly who is related to who, by marriage, blood or whatever. Kinda tough to figure out if \"mom\" is ex or current wife, and whose kids are whose. \n\nNevertheless, it appears to my confused brain that you are NTA. I hope everyone who went enjoyed the movie.", "Your wife is a control freak and needs to get off her high horse! Your not the asswhole at all.", "Was it Spider-Verse? NTA by the way", "NTA, you weren't rewarding disrespect. She was disrespectful to push them to break a promise. Then played the not your kids BS. Fuck that she's definitely TA", "NTA. This exchange makes me raise an eyebrow. Do your kids get along okay? It seems like. Why is your wife trying to incite kids against each other?\n\nMight need some time to sit and discuss between you two what's going on.", "NTA\n\nAny other person would have said, \"Oh, that's right, I'm so glad you remembered! You're such good kids for keeping your promises!\"\n\nInstead your wife was telling them, \"Break your promise, break your promise! Fine, you won't break your promise? YOU CAN BE BORED!\"\n\nThere is something incredibly intentional about this, OP. I would observe her more closely around your kids, especially when she doesn't think you're watching.\n\nYou treat her kids like they're yours. She treats your kids like...they're an inconvenience to her.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you have 6 kids, not 5.", "The not your kids thing is a major \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nNTA. \n\nAlso makes one wonder how she feels about YOUR kids.", "Yeah it really seems like she\u2019s trying to create an us vs them dynamic instead of a 2 parts of a whole. She was upset because *her* kids put a promise they made to *your* kids over what she wanted to do to the point where she punished them for it by throwing a fit and not doing anything\u2026 and then got mad that you took them for ice cream instead of doing nothing. You ruined her punishment. So she doubled down and threw a fit when all the kids were there and tried to ruin the movie. She\u2019s emotionally manipulating her own children and trying to weaponize them against yours.", "For real. Reading her reactions during this ordeal gave me bad vibes. NTA OP", "ya dude. this set off all my alarm bells", "I say this in my head so many times when I browse here.", "And proud of them for making the promise to begin with. This sub has so many stories of blended families that don't work, of kids resenting being forced to communicate and live with step sibs. This story is refreshing from the perspective of sibling communication, but confounding as to why the mom is trying to sabotage this.", "your wife don\u2019t like your kids.\n\nthink about that.\n\nshe was trying ***REALLY HARD*** to get her kids to break a promise they made to your kids.\n\nshe\u2019s not gonna stop.", "Exactly!", "I think some couples counseling might be in order here. The kids are fine, they seem to get along well but there's something very odd about the way your wife is trying to separate them into 'your kids' and 'my kids' when they clearly feel like family to each other. And punishing them for wanting to keep their promise? Doubly weird. I think it might be helpful to find out what her thought process is in a situation where a third party can mediate.", "The Eye of the Family Drama Storm, that's gonna be a song title when I start a band \ud83d\ude01", "Family Drama Storm would also just be a sick band name haha", "Yessss haha!", "NTA, ALL your kids sound delightful. I hope whatever selfish behavior your wife has isn\u2019t transferred to your kids.", "Esh,  her more.   You need to communicate better, or get the kids out of this situation", "NTA - the kids were never disrespectful. How is taking the boys to the movies ok but for ice cream not? \n\nYour wife sounds crazy and mean.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds exhausting", "NTA, but your wife is a piece of work. She was disrespected by the kids whose boundaries and commitment she was disrespecting? Sheesh, that one takes some mental gymnastics.", "NTA what the actual hell is wrong with your wife? Tryna drive a wedge between \u201cher\u201d kids and \u201cyour kids\u201d instead of celebrating how much all your kids love and respect each other? Woman needs therapy.", "Why are you married to the wicked witch of the west?", "NTA but I think you have a bigger issue I think your wife hates your kids and wants her kids to hate them as well to try to divide you from them!", "Okay, what are the 6-7 times?\n\nHe took the boys to ice-cream instead of making them stay home because they didn\u2019t want to go to the movies without their siblings.\n\nHe took all the kids to the movies because they\u2019d all waited patiently to be able to watch it together and mom decided to \u201chave a headache\u201d and prevent anyone from going.", "Also, notice the double standard? It was ok for her to take her sons to a movie without her daughter (she was at ballet), but it wasn\u2019t ok for OP to take the boys for ice cream without her? Only the wife gets to exclude her daughter?", "ESH but the kids.\n\nYou and your wife need marriage counseling badly. She obviously has issues with the roles the kids and you have in each others lives. But you obviously don\u2019t respect her. Maybe she wanted to see that movie with all the kids but actually was tired? You couldn\u2019t wait one more day? Did you even ask? They had waited a long time, they could\u2019ve waited one more day. And you did actually take her legal children without her permission-that\u2019s weird. If she\u2019s pulling a controlling move, you doing the same thing isn\u2019t any better. \n\nI feel bad for these kids. Seems like they\u2019re doing their best and they have two supposedly adults in their lives with major emotional problems and no respect for each other.", "NTA - But your wife needs to consider why she's acting the way she does.", "NTA. Tell your presumably ADULT wife to grow the eff up. She's acting like a 5 year old.", "NTA\n\nEvery day this sub gets horror stories of what happens when stepsiblings don't get along. I don't get why your wife is so butthurt that the stepsiblings are getting along in your household, that's a great thing if she wants to have a happy family.", "NTA. I don't understand her logic here. She wanted to exclude the other kids by having the boys see the movie, they very thoughtfully said no, and you provided them an alternative to do that day since she was going to do something with them ONLY anyways. \n\nThis reads like she specifically wanted to hurt your kids or sow discord. And then she made the \"not your kids\" comment. This needs to be nipped in the bud immediately imo.", "I agree  it's also time for you to start paying very close attention to how she treats your son's. She's absolutely fine hurting them for her children's feelings so what else is she doing. What evil little digs does she do to your children when you're not there.", "She didn't have a problem leaving the daughter at ballet to see the movie, so what was the difference between you getting them ice cream? Her double standards are really evident here.", "Yeah, seems like the adults are the problem here", "nah just seems like one of them so far", "Maybe she thought the movie was 'not appropriate' for daughter(read not girly enough) and didn't want to pay for step sons?  It's mean but there it is.\n\nNTA.  You did a solid and your kids/step kids sound like a band waiting to happen.", "NTA. Thank you for being a good dad to ALL the kids.", "NTA. I'd be ticked off by her crap.", "NTA - Your wife sounds like hard work man", "Anyone just read the title then go straight to the comments to be surprised?", "NTA but wifey is & a bit of a hypocrite! It\u2019s ok to take her kids to see a movie without their step siblings but it\u2019s not ok to take them for ice cream without her daughter! Sounds like different rules apply to her bio children. What u did was really sweet & she should be glad ur good to her children. She could lesson from u about making her step kids feels important & included. Sounds like u want to treat all the kids equally but she doesn\u2019t! I imagine it must\u2019ve been a lil hurtful for ur kids to hear about her trying to come between the the kids & ruin something they wanted to do together.", "Your wife was being petty, a control freak, and an asshole.\n\nGood for you for standing up for the children, and taking them to the movie anyways.\n\nNTA OP.", "Nta\u2026. Sounds like your kids/step kids have a good relationship why is your wife trying to throw that off balance that\u2019s my question especially when getting blended families to get along is so hard and alot of them have issues when they\u2019re adults most parents would help support this good relationship not try and sabotage it", "Disrespect? In what parallel universe not wanting to go to a movie night out is \u201cdisrespecting\u201d?\n\nNTA.", "I noticed that too lmaoo the mental gymnastics of that one. \ud83d\ude02\n\nSad that OP is a better parent to all of them and his wife is a selfish thief of joy."]}
