She knows the routine if she goes to this movie theater enough times that when you purchase tickets you also purchase a certain seat to sit in. I don't know how many times I've gone to a movie theater before the tickets to a movie had to match the seat location you said in, but most of those times had to do with people pulling out their cell phones in the middle of the movie to look and see if they got a certain message or phone call instead of walking out of the theater to check their phones. The bright lights from the phones really affect my eyes and distract me from the movie. I don't pay x amount of dollars to go see a movie just to have someone next to me or a few rows down from me pull out the phone and look at it while the movie's going on. It's recruited uncalled for.
