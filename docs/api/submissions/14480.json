He has a sister we have been NC with for almost a decade. She is a spoiled brat honestly and when she didn't get her way tried to start problems with my brother and accuse him of things so we cut her off. \n\nWe still see her at family event because everyone still talks to her. It was rough for me for a while to go to events with my husband seeing how everyone was still close to her despite my husband and I telling everyone what she did. It really hurt me that his entire family just took her side I thought after they herd what she did they would see what a toxic person she is. But if they still chose to have her in their lives there's nothing I can do about it. Usually we just ignore each other, I have made it clear to MIL that SIL is not to go anywhere near our children or speak to them.\n\nYesterday we went to MIL's for easter, we knew SIL would be there and did our normal routine of completely ignoring each other. There are 5 other kids in the family all children of husbands cousins. SIL made them each easter baskets and made a big show of giving them to each kid in front of my kids. Of course nothing for my kids. My kids were so upset they didn't get anything from her. (they don't know who she is we just tell them she is grandmas mean friend and to stay away from her.)\n\nThis for me was the last straw now she was actively trying to make my kids feel bad, making sure they felt left out. I'm sure she planned this for that purpose alone.  We left right after dinner with our very upset children, I didn't want to fight with family in front of the kids so I waited until this morning to call MIL.\n\nI asked her if she though it was ok what SIL pulled yesterday. She claimed to have no idea what I was talking about. When I brought up the easter baskets she tried to justify it by saying that SIL is close to her cousin's kids so of course she would make them easter baskets and it had nothing to do with my kids. Once again condoning her toxic behavior. \n\nI told MIL plain and simple this was the last straw and the fact that she is justifying it made it worse. I told her we would no longer be attending any event SIL is at so the ball was in her court. She told me I was being ridiculous and the easter baskets had nothing to do with me or my kids. She told me she would still be inviting SIL and it was up to us what we wanted to do. Before I hung up I told her to think about if her toxic daughter is wroth the relationship with her grandchildren then hung up.\n\nMy brother and his wife think I am totally in the right and just looking out for my kids. But my friend told me to let it go because I am causing tense situations and my kids will suffer and miss out on family. I don't want SIL near them when she will keep pulling this crap to try and make my kids feel bad I'm sure other mothers will see where I'm coming from.", "created_utc": 1681159246, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hvhfj/aita_for_telling_mil_that_this_will_be_the_last/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. your brother was a creep to her, and she called him out. lmao you are defending your creep ass brother creeping on her and it's not a good look. I'm surprised YOU are still invited to family shit.\n\nALSO: you can't have it both ways. you can't have it so she's not allowed any contact with your kids AND she has to give them gifts.", "Your married brother texted your SIL and told her to come over while his wife was away.

Your brother sent her sexually inappropriate texts which you excused as jokes. You then told her to stay away from your kids but got mad when she didn\u2019t make them Easter baskets. You\u2019re disgusting and so is your brother and your husband\u2019s family would probably love it if you stopped showing up to their family events.", "YTA simply for expecting her to make easter baskets for your children despite going NC and making it clear you did not want her near you and your kids.\n\nThat makes ZERO sense. You also can\u2019t force other members of the family to take sides.", "YTA.  If she felt the text message your brother sent was creepy...and after you and your husband told everyone....people agreed with her...the issue is probably that your brother *was* creepy.  Especially when you say he was \"just making jokes.\"  There's always posts on here about parents/siblings siding with their family member just \"making jokes\" and it turns out they were sexually harassing people or worse.  If it wasn't a bad thing - you would have said it up front instead of being secretive about it in your post, and then in your comment.", "YTA. Dude, really?\n\n>She tried to say he was fliting with her and asking her to come over while his wife was away. She could have destroyed his marriage. He was joking he didn't want her to come over. But she is so full of herself she could not possibly believe it was a joke. she thinks every man wants her\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a joke. He only said it was a joke so that he didn\u2019t get in trouble with his wife. Anyone that is married and says these things \u201cas a joke\u201d are really just fishing to see if the other person would accept it.", "YTA\n\nYou flat out lied. Your SIL didn't accuse your brother of things. You tried to excuse his behaviour as a joke.\n\nHe tried to get your SIL to cheat, and when she told HIS WIFE, he played it off as 'I was joking'.\n\nYou cut her off because she called out your brother for being garbage.\n\nYou cut her off from your kids. What did you expect was going to happen? You said 'she is not to go anywhere near our children or speak to them'.\n\nSo she doesn't. That doesn't mean she doesn't get to have a relationship with the other kids. You have excluded her, and therefore excluded your children from her.\n\nOf course your brother agrees with you. Your SIL refused to sleep with him, he dislikes her as much as you do.\n\nETA: also forgot to mention that at the time of the 'joke' your SIL was a minor and your brother is a fricken teacher. So he's a creep.", "You didn't make it clear what accusations she made to spoil the relationship in the first place. You could have forgiven her and opened up a line of communication. Yet you stone wall her, and that's ok, but it's not ok for you to expect her to give you or your kids anything. \n\nAfter all, what did you bring? Makes me think, the start of all these tensions was you making a mountain out of a mole hill over something as petty as this. Grow up.\n\nAnd, bonus, you get the mother in law involved, and try to pit family against each other, then guilt trip and blackmail the MIL with your grandkids, just because MIL didn't want to be in the middle of it all the stress, which you created. \n\nYTA; a manipulative one at that", "INFO:\n\nFirst question:  \\*\"...tried to start problems with my brother and accuse him of things\"\\*\n\nWhat problems did she try to start, and what exactly did she accuse him of? \n\nSecond question: did you and your husband get any gifts for all 8 children?\n\nEDIT: based on comments, YTA.

It was a little rude of her give gifts to other kids in front of your kids, but you started this and aren't actually staying away from her.", "So just to get this straight:\n\nYour brother (who is married) tried to hit on your SiL, who then rejected him and outed him as a creep, at which point of course suddenly \u201cit was just a joke\u201d (\ud83d\ude44). \n\nSo then you try to start a smear campaign against your SiL bc she \u201ccan\u2019t take a joke\u201d and is clearly \u201cjust dying for attention,\u201d but are unsuccessful at getting anyone involved in your drama. \n\nSo instead you just ignore each other, which is fine, until the boundary that YOU put in place results in your children not getting Easter baskets from the woman you have expressly forbid them from interacting with?\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nOh\n\nYTA", "I'm confused. You went low/no contact with SIL and ignore her at family gatherings . . . yet you're upset that she didn't make Easter baskets for your kids?\n\nINFO: Why would your kids expect to get anything from \"grandma's mean friend\"?\n\nINFO: Why are you surprised she's also low/no contact with you and your family?\n\nHonestly you sound entitled and it's more like you're the problem. The rest of the family doesn't see the problem with SIL? Chances are you need to find a mirror.\n\n~~E S H~~  YTA (updating based on additional info in the comments)", "YTA\n\nWhy are you still checking out her posts if you're no contact? Do you think that everything she is doing is just to spite you and your kids?\n\nYour brother texted your sister-in-law and told her she should come over while his wife was away. I would not be amused if my husband did that nor would I be amused if one of my in-laws sent me a message like that. It's not her fault saying something might have ruined his marriage. It's his fault for sending something that might have ruined his marriage. If he's such a jokester, then his wife should have known it was a joke. So how could his marriage get ruined by his wife hearing about another one of his hilarious jokes?\n\nWhenever people start with the he's a jokester, we usually know it means a person said something inappropriate just as your brother did hear, and another person is trying to excuse / enable his behavior.\n\nYou have created a situation where you want it her family to turn on her because your brother sent her an inappropriate text? And now you have poisoned your children by saying that's a Grammy's bad friend stay away from her. But you still feel entitled to gifts from them for your children? Wouldn't they have followed your orders and run away if she tried to give them gifts??\n\nYou made it seem as though she had done something to you and your husband. She didn't. She told the truth about something your brother did. And if the truth makes you look like an a-hole. You should probably be more concerned about what you're doing then about whether or not people are going to tell. You seem very very toxic very very bitter and very very narcissistic", "YTA. You are NC with her, but still expect gifts. It seems as if you and your husband are actually the toxic ones. What exactly did SIL do then?", "You handed her a double-edged sword. If you set boundaries, you can\u2019t reasonably get mad that she respected the boundaries. Was the big show intentional? Probably. But she couldn\u2019t win either way, so still YTA.\n\nEdit: since more info has come out since I posted my judgement, I think it\u2019s somehow important for me to say that you\u2019re a way bigger AH than I first thought.", "Based on all of your comments and what you conveniently left out of your original post? I'm going with YTA. \n\nIt sounds like your brother's \"joke\" was inappropriate and sexually charged and everyone except you and your husband saw it given that they all still speak to and support SIL. You sound like you're making excuses for a serial creep. \n\nYou're NC with his sister. NC means no contact, and that includes no gifts for your kids. She was under no obligation to give them anything and was, in fact, respecting the boundary that *you* set with her. You should have either prepared your kids for that, or stayed home. \n\nFrankly, it sounds like you and your brother are the problems here, not SIL.", "YTA.  Just because you chose to cut off someone doesn't mean other family members should take sides as well.  That's her daughter ofc she is gonna be invited.  And you basically villainized her the whole time but still expect her to buy gifts for your kids?  How does that make any sense.  Seems like she just followed your request of not going near your kids and staying away from you as well.\n\nEdit: After reading OP's comments, she is a much much bigger AH.  The whole reason you are villainizing your SIL is because your brother is a creep, and your SIL rejected him.  Now you are spoiling her name and making your brother out to be the victim.  When a guy asks you to come over when his wife is not home, it's never meant as a joke, he just got caught and started backpedaling.", "YTA - based on your cryptic comments, your brother was a creep to your SIL and you are trying to force his family into cutting her out. This will backfire. \n\nYou also were very hypocritical trying to tell her how she needed to get gifts for your kids after telling her not to interact with you. \n\n*Info - The way you wrote this it\u2019s be very easy to say N T A but I think it matters why you went NC with the SIL.

This woman has no relationship with your children. If you prefer not to spend the holidays with her that's your choice but don't but your mother in law in the middle. You're an adult, you can make these decisions without dragging your in laws in the middle.", "What things did your SIL accuse your husband of? That could be a huge range of things that directly plays into justifying your reaction. You clearly have extremely strong feelings about it, whatever it was.

He has a sister we have been NC with for almost a decade. She is a spoiled brat honestly and when she didn't get her way tried to start problems with my brother and accuse him of things so we cut her off. \n\nWe still see her at family event because everyone still talks to her. It was rough for me for a while to go to events with my husband seeing how everyone was still close to her despite my husband and I telling everyone what she did. It really hurt me that his entire family just took her side I thought after they herd what she did they would see what a toxic person she is. But if they still chose to have her in their lives there's nothing I can do about it. Usually we just ignore each other, I have made it clear to MIL that SIL is not to go anywhere near our children or speak to them.\n\nYesterday we went to MIL's for easter, we knew SIL would be there and did our normal routine of completely ignoring each other. There are 5 other kids in the family all children of husbands cousins. SIL made them each easter baskets and made a big show of giving them to each kid in front of my kids. Of course nothing for my kids. My kids were so upset they didn't get anything from her. (they don't know who she is we just tell them she is grandmas mean friend and to stay away from her.)\n\nThis for me was the last straw now she was actively trying to make my kids feel bad, making sure they felt left out. I'm sure she planned this for that purpose alone.  We left right after dinner with our very upset children, I didn't want to fight with family in front of the kids so I waited until this morning to call MIL.\n\nI asked her if she though it was ok what SIL pulled yesterday. She claimed to have no idea what I was talking about. When I brought up the easter baskets she tried to justify it by saying that SIL is close to her cousin's kids so of course she would make them easter baskets and it had nothing to do with my kids. Once again condoning her toxic behavior. \n\nI told MIL plain and simple this was the last straw and the fact that she is justifying it made it worse. I told her we would no longer be attending any event SIL is at so the ball was in her court. She told me I was being ridiculous and the easter baskets had nothing to do with me or my kids. She told me she would still be inviting SIL and it was up to us what we wanted to do. Before I hung up I told her to think about if her toxic daughter is wroth the relationship with her grandchildren then hung up.\n\nMy brother and his wife think I am totally in the right and just looking out for my kids. But my friend told me to let it go because I am causing tense situations and my kids will suffer and miss out on family. I don't want SIL near them when she will keep pulling this crap to try and make my kids feel bad I'm sure other mothers will see where I'm coming from.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH. You should NEVER try to force a mother to choose between her children, that's a YTA. If she chose to get baskets for the other children she definitely should have included yours just because they wouldn't understand being left out at that age but, if she chose NOT to get your children baskets, then she should have given the other baskets to those children before you got there, after you left, in another room, etc. And that's where the ESH comes in. I just feel bad for the MIL and the kids who didn't understand why they got no baskets.", "You always keep kids out of a feud. \n\nYou told your kids she's grandma's mean friend and they have to stay away from her.\n\nSIL is making baskets for all kids except yours, and hands them out in front of them.\n\nYou two are both immature adults fighting your feud over the backs of innocent children.\n\nESH", "ESH. If SIL made a big show out of giving out the Easter baskets, then that is a seriously shit move. No matter what anyone\u2019s feelings are about the parents, kids are innocent and your kids did not deserve to be made to feel left out. However, you don\u2019t get to dictate SIL\u2019s relationship with the other kids in the family and it is a very entitled attitude that you have if you think she should provide gifts to your kids after you went NC.", "NTA\n\nStand up for your kids. \n\nYou don't say what your husband's reaction was to the Easter baskets or if he was in agreement with your call to his mother. \n\nThis is his family, so he gets to decide his relationship with them, but you absolutely can protect your children and yourself. \n\nYour MIL and the rest of the family get to make their own choices as well. Don't try to make her choose between you and her daughter, you'll lose every time. \n\nPerhaps in the future, you invite your MIL and a couple other family members to your home one or two weekends before the big holiday events, and on the actual days you do things with your side of the family or start your own traditions. \n\nThere is an interesting dynamic that could play out. You mention that the feud has been going on for a decade and that all the other children were that of cousins. So, the SIL doesn't have children, and your children are the only grandchildren? And the SIL is rapidly approaching an age in which children will no longer be an option for her?\n\nProtect your relationship with your husband's side of the family, minus SIL. Host things on your turf, take the lead. Until then you are allowing SIL (and MIL) to control the narrative and you're coming across as the one causing drama. \n\nIf you really want to shake things up, plan a get together with the cousins, directly and solely. You know, because you all have young kids. Don't even mention to MIL. Not a birthday or any big event, just 'hey, do you want to meet at the fastfood playplace, or picnic at the playground'. Just something extremely kid-centric. Then wait for it to get back to her in the course of normal family discussions. Even if she asks that she be included in the future, and you know she'll also invite the SIL, it will still be your event, in a venue of your choosing.
