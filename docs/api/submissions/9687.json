It\u2019s her family, she can go without you. As long as you show up for big things, I don\u2019t see the problem. I visit my MIL, but generally it\u2019s when I want to. My spouse doesn\u2019t go to my parents each time I do. Couples can do things without each other.", "I think it\u2019s weird some folks are saying it\u2019s \u2018unhealthy\u2019 to see ur parents once a week. Uh I mean if u don\u2019t like them for sure. And there should be no pressure or shame, but just chillin with your folks once a week is actually a sign of a healthy family.", "NTA, Maybe suggest a weekly family dinner mid-week, time allowing.", "Assuming your wife can still go to dinner on her own, I'm not sure why it's an issue at all.  All she has to say if anyone asks where you are is that you're taking the opportunity to relax in a quiet house.  Politely declining an invitation to your in-laws' shouldn't be a big issue.  \n\nHave you asked your wife why she's so upset about it?  Does she think that you not being there says something about the state of your marriage?  Does she not like going to events alone?  I'm just not sure why it's an issue.  NTA", "NTA- a weekly family dinner is a BIG  expectation and will only get worse once you start having kids. It\u2019s not about cutting them off but maybe going twice a month. You and your wife do need some autonomy from her family and yours to create your traditions, grow your relationships and enjoy each other\u2019s company", "NTA \n\nEvery weekend is too much in my opinion", "NTA.  It's nice that they have that tradition but expecting you to go every weekend is excessive.", "Every week is way too much", "NTA, it does seem exhausting", "Every weekend is too much. I wouldn\u2019t want my partner to come and have dinner with my family every weekend because I\u2019d also prefer some time with my family without them, as much as like they would like some time for themselves. Every weekend is too exhausting imo.

However, your wife should be able to visit with her family whenever she wants. Just set a boundary. Maybe go every other week or once a month.", "NTA - you need time for yourself too. This was a similar deal in my first marriage and well, played a role in the divorce too bc every Sunday turned into 4 days / week.", "NTA. Every weekend is a huge commitment.", "NTA...every weekend is excessive. It's concerning that she gets angry over you declining one time. You have a right to your own time.", "NTA.

You want to do married stuff together. Provide better experiences for your wife. She will come to appreciate the time you spend together. \n\nIf you are just playing video games or watching TV, that is not a good reason to not go. \n\nMy family plays table top games, goes on hikes, etc", "NTA - It's completely unreasonable to demand a partner attend dinner every weekend with in-laws.  Sounds like you offer plenty of time to them and that you've established a good relationship with them.  Start your negotiation at one dinner a month and meet in the middle.  You're married.  You're not on a leash.", "NTA. I know it depends on the culture you're in, but it doesn't seem healthy to me that a married adult needs to have dinner with her parents EVERY week. And think about if you had the same tradition with your parents. Would you be going to both every week, and giving up your whole weekends? Are her parents very conservative? Are they reluctant to fully let their \"little girl\" be grown up and independent? Does she really want to go, or is she afraid to say no to them?", "NTA.\n\nJust put your foot down and make it clear that you will not be attending all weekly dinners henceforth. This has happened because you kept going. So your wife is used to it. But it gets really boring eventually. Been there, done that. I get it. Sometimes we just need some alone time. Simply say NO and follow through. From now on, only go occasionally when you feel like it. They will get the point and be okay with it with time.", "When my parents were dying (yes at the same time and yes it was as grueling and awful as you can imagine), I visited them one or more times a week after work.  I attended alone as my SO did not need to experience that and I cherished my time with my parents.  They were ill and dying for 5 months (Mum) and 18 months (my dad).\n\nIf I could go through that without. my SO's mandatory attendance, your wife can certainly visit her parent without you.", "NAH, consider working on your communication about it. You might have a better outcome if you focus on you and your wife's underlying needs (like rest, connection, harmony, adventure, relational closeness, various kinds of intimacy) instead of the means to create them (like staying home, having dinner with extended family, going out for dinner, etc). All the best.", "Married life is about balance, and at the moment yours is leaning A LOT towards your inlaws.  Among other things, this precludes you from going cinema, having a weekend out of town, going to a concert, a sporting event, etc..", "NTA-  Going to the in-laws every  weekend to have dinner is not healthy.  Both you and your wife, need to do things together, with friends and even alone with friends. My wife was wanted to have dinner with her parents/siblings once on thee weekends. At first I was OK, then when something came up, she was we are going to my parents.  I went, got a scissor and she ask me what that was food. I said to cut the umbilical cord.

Working full time gives you a limited amount of time off. This precious down time should mostly be 'yours' to use as best as you can to meet your 'needs'.  That may be rest/recharge or accomplishing tasks and chores. Spending time with extended family is a secondary option - key word 'option' - and doing so *every weekend?* NO. That's too big an Ask, and a fast-track way to suck the happiness out of a marriage. My own mother lives close by now, and we usually go over Sunday afternoons to play cards and have dinner - I love my mom, but I recognize this is a 'chore' for my husband (sometimes for me too) and I would NEVER *demand* that he do this *every week!* Days off are precious and he needs to do what's best for his mental/emotional health - and spending time with In Laws (even good ones) can be draining  - you might as well be at work! *Every* weekend is NOT okay.", "NTA, it's great that you two have such a close relationship with her family, but every weekend is a bit much.

Ask you wife how she would feel if you demanded that she spend every weekend with you at an obligation on your family's side? Would she have an issue with that? Of course she would.
