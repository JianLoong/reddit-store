He is purposely making your relationship very sexual.  Be careful.  I would not be alone with him.  Put a lock on your bedroom door or find some way to block it so he can't come in while you are sleeping.  Move out if you can.  Take a self-defense class.  This does not sound like a safe situation.", "NTA, but dear GOD your mom is. Your brother is a creep, and if you've got the cash to, look into door locks for your room. He's escalating his behavior (going from comments to physical touch), and your mother needs to wake up and realize her son's acting predatory toward you. Your mom is failing you, and I say this as a parent. She's being a bad mother. You deserve better than this. Do what you can to keep yourself safe, and if you're able, get out of there as soon as possible. I'm so, so sorry.", "NTA - get out of that house before your brother does something worse and your mother doesn't believe you.", "NTA. The escalation in his behavior is alarming. He's testing the waters and your mother has just told him it's safe for him to escalate further because she's not going to stop him. \n\nYou should consider reporting him. Someone needs to protect you from him and if your mother isn't going to do it, you need to do it for yourself.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mom is dismissing you. You need to tell her EVERYTHING he has said and done that is creepy.", "NTA.  Your brother absolutely does sound like a creep.\n\nYou are not overthinking this, or misunderstanding anything.  He is sexualizing you - no other way around it.", "NTA. Your mother is an asshole for giving excuses for shitty behavior. Your brother isn\u2019t a creep though, he is worst than just a normal creep. Your his sister and making sexual advances towards you should not be happening. The police should be called the next time since your mom doesn\u2019t see what is wrong with sexual assault and harassment.", "NTA? This is sexual harassment and assault. Unfortunately, telling your mother did not do anything. The excuse that \u201che is a man\u201d is absolutely unacceptable. Try to find a way to get out of that house, or try to talk with someone about this. Maybe a counselor or someone who can help you?", "NTA\n\nGreat, your mother is ignoring the actions of a person who sexually assaulted his sister.  \n\nWhat would she say if you told her some guy just rubbed his hand on your butt and made a creepy remark.   Would she be alarmed?    Or would she blame you?  Or tell you you're overblowing the situation?    \n\nIf she gets alarmed, then tell her it was your brother.   Is she still alarmed?    \n\nFollow the advice that has been given in this thread.   Get yourself in a safe place if you can.   He's not to be trusted.", "NTA\n\nNope. His behavior is gross and inappropriate, and your mother is excusing it.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to misunderstand here.", "NTA\n\nI hope you are able to move out soon.", "If that's for real. You're not misunderstanding that that's sexual harassment. Your mother's behavior is only going to enable his to get worse I think you need to have some space between the two of you.\n\nIt doesn't matter that he's your brother. If he makes you uncomfortable, then he makes you uncomfortable.\n\nI wish you good luck.  I don't know what else to tell you to do because I don't know if you have another place to go to. If you do though I would definitely go there I would move out right away.", "NTA, but your mom is for not saying \"WTF\" and dealing with your brother.", "NTA. Not at all. He\u2019s harassing you and assaulting you, which is unlawful. Your brother is obviously an A and your mother is too - I can\u2019t believe she would defend his revolting behaviour.   \nI hope you can move out sometime soon.", "NTA. I'd call him out loud and clear everything he does  sense your mom seems to not realize that something is amiss.  Make sure you are on alert with him because you never know how far he will go. It seems like he's looking at you in a sexual way and that could lead to an assault. I hope not but be on guard and try to stay away from him as much as you can.", "Get out of that house. ***Get out of that house!***", "NTA.\nIf your mother won't help you, find someone who should. His behavior is way out of line, especially because he's your BROTHER and basically sexually harassing you.", "NTA I'm gagging as I'm reading this. This is so gross. call the police and file a report so that he and your mom knows you aren't kidding. Police have to file a report when you call them or whatever, cops get called all the time for filing reports and yes it may be annoying to them but it's concerning but may make it stop.", "NTA and him touching you sexually against your will is sexual assault. Any silence at his behavior will be taken by him as an invitation to push the envelope by him. Don't be alone with him and move into a different home because he's a creep.", "NTA\n\nThat all sounds creepy.", "NTA he will do more, worse, possibly soon if he knows you're leaving. If you have any relatives or friends in town, spend as much time at their houses as possible and tell them your situation. It's devastating that your mother has failed you so spectacularly. This situation is absolutely nauseating and with all the love in my heart, please use the therapy resources at your college as soon as you get the chance. \n\nI think I would commit physical violence if someone did to me what he did to you. Don't be afraid to do whatever you need to do in order to stay safe. Don't let your guard down for a minute.", "Is there anyone else you can tell or live with until you finish your senior year? Dad, grandparents, aunts or uncles? Please stay safe, lock your door, and move out the second you can. I would also go to the police. Even if you don\u2019t think they can help you, they should at least make a report and have it on his record. Also, get some mace, next time he tries touching you, grab it and spray directly in his face. He\u2019ll think twice before touching you again. I\u2019m wishing you nothing but the best.", "Please be careful. Your brother is a sexual predator, and groping you is sexual assault. You're absolutely NTA, your mom definitely is for excusing away his behavior (\"he's a man\"? So all men are horny for their siblings?). And he is as well, obviously.", "NTA- Your brother is sexually harassing you. Frankly, the ass thing could be construed as assault. You are not safe. Please take every step to protect yourself and get out as soon as possible.", "Yuck, Nta.  Also is your mom crazy?  Please please find a way to move out. I know you\u2019re 18 so you may not have the money or resources to move out. Please put a lock on your door. It\u2019s very inappropriate and tbh I\u2019m scared for you that one day he\u2019s going to do more than touch your butt. I was sexually abused by a family member. I never want another person to experience what I went through. For the love of god, please find a way out of this home.

Tell your mother that good, decent, proper men don't treat women and particularly female relatives of any degree the way your brother has been treating you.

Something like this happened to me. It gets worse with time. It does not get better. I thought I could ride it out until I went off college too. Nope. Ended up reporting this person. Sure I went into foster care, but no one touched me ever again. I was safe. I really hope OP will be ok", "Like another poster (probably a few) stated: look for hidden cameras in your room/bathroom.
