Turns out that was a lie, I snooped around her email and found that insurance offered her $41k. I just laughed it off with her. Today she said that I was deemed 100% at fault and that her premiums for her next car is going to be $150 more and demanded that I pay the difference for the next 6 years. Again, I called the insurance company and they said that I was not deemed at fault. What the fuck. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s strapped for cash, just lying to me again and again.

It's not always about money, sometimes people just want something to hold over your head. NTA.", "NTA but you will not really get anywhere by calling her names.

As I've gotten older I've started going lower and lower contact with her. I am almost 30 and we talk maybe once a month, I play nice for now because I have an underage sister I raised and am very close with. My underage sister is in high-school now so once she graduates I will probably go no contact with my mom. My mom never wanted me but was more than happy to have another child and take on step children. She almost died a few years back and I was the only one who showed up to help her after multiple surgeries and she still treats me like dog shit. \n\nNow if we ever go out to eat I ask for separate checks,  I won't let her pay for a thing to hold over my head and won't give her a chance later on to say I owe her money for something. \n\nI know you're young and car insurance is expensive but if you're able to start cutting the cord of being financially tied to your mother I would strongly recommend it", "Tell it like it is - it's not right in the slightest for your mother to exploit you like that.\n\nNTA, maybe don't use her car anymore, and get out of this toxic environment as soon as you can.", "NTA. Your mom needs mental help. Get out as soon as you can and consider no contact.

NTA.", "NTA.\n\nFriendly advice: LEAVE! Get your own place, your own job, your own car, and your own life. Sorry, but your mom is not in her right mind and abusive!", "Leaning towards NTA. Calling her a bitch is probably too far, but the lying and manipulation from her to get some cash out of you is messed up. Based on your age and the fact that you\u2019re car sharing, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not exactly in a position to be paying and she\u2019ll know that.", "NTA.
