For example, not wearing makeup, not always wearing jewelry, and disliking dresses.\n\nRegardless, we mostly get along. This morning, my mom asked me to go with her to get her eyebrows threaded. This isn't an unusual thing for her to ask, cause she likes company, so I agreed. Everything was normal, we went in the car and to the salon, and she got her eyebrows done. \n\nBut then, she suddenly turned to the lady who did her brows and told her that I would be getting mine done, too. She hadn't mentioned anything of the sort to me, and I was taken off guard. I didn't want my eyebrows threaded. Not only had I heard it was extremely painful, I liked my eyebrows the way they were. \n\nPlus, my mom herself had told me that after you got your eyebrows threaded, you needed to always upkeep them, or else they'd look bad. And I've never really liked trying new things and change.\n\nI told the lady firmly that I would not be getting my eyebrows done. And my mom looked mad at me and she said that I would be and the lady looked really conflicted, but started getting the chair ready for me. My mom quietly told me (in our language, not english, so the lady couldn't understand) that I would be getting this done, and it was for my own good, and I would look so much prettier after, and I'd thank her after, and how could I know i didn't like it if I didn't do it?\n\nI turned to my mom and said that if she made me do it, I would scream and kick. I was being 100% serious, but my mom never takes anything I say seriously. When the lady had her back turned, she started trying to push me towards the chair, and I started screaming. \n\nMy mom looked immediately distraught and let me go. Everyone in the salon turned to look at us. My mom has anxiety and she quickly paid and left the store. She started yelling at me when we were in the car, but also started breathing really weird like it was hard. \n\nWhen we got home she went to her room and closed the door, and I'm pretty sure she had an anxiety attack.

You're 16 and she clearly disrespects your bodily autonomy.

Walking out would have been better. \nBut I understand that it was a eruption of emotions a long time coming and you are still 16, not a adult.\n\nI suggest sitting down with her and try yet again to talk.

You have thoughts and ideas of your own.\nAnd as long as it does not involve direct danger or a real threat to your future you shoul be aible to express your self.", "NTA, a minor didn't regulate their emotions because their body autonomy was being infringed.

I relate to this a lot being the \"tom boy\" out of me and my sister and not dealing well with change. Both of you have anxiety from what it sounds like. You are at an age that you need to be in the loop on things that pertain to you, meaning if she wanted you to try threading, she should've let you know at least a day before; explained why she wanted you to try and understood if you said no. Parents need to respect boundaries and I know it may be hard to explain these things that she should get. depending on her age, she most likely grew up in a community that didn't acknowledge mental health. Your mom may not have gotten what she needed from her guardians which just starts a domino effect that you have the power to stop. So, give her a small break just bc of that simple fact (if that assumption fits her narrative), but I do think you should have a mature conversation with your mom and let her know how you feel about more than just the eyebrow situation, explain that you know you embarrassed her and apologize, and tell her where you want to go from there with your relationship. you can say this in whatever order you need to make it fit for you. Regardless of what happens, make sure you put yourself in the best position for a happy life, try to smile every day and do selfcare, make yourself the main character so no one can ever dim your light. When you know who you are, accept your faults and are actively trying to work on them, things fall into place, and you won't feel as angry about things you know you're right about.", "NTA, your mom blindsided you, and you put your foot down and said no.

Were there other ways to deal with the situation? Clearly yes, and better ones at that.

Looks like you Mom brought a knife to a social-pressure gunfight. \n\nYou and your Mom have very different values based around the importance of other people's opinions.

My opinion here is more like that you maybe can try now and talk with her in peace, maybe in a few days that you like yourself how you are and you don't like it that she keeps pushing her standats on you.

It's your body and your choice. I'm not a feminine woman and it was always like that, but my mom never forced me to wear jeans, have long hairs or anything.

She doesn't get to make choices for you.  You warned her, she did it anyway.", "NTA. My mom did the same to me when I was a teen. Context - I didn\u2019t do my hair, never wore dresses, didn\u2019t do makeup, and I also had thick bushy eyebrows. She tried plucking my eyebrows herself by blocking my way out of the bathroom. Eventually, at 18, I started waxing my eyebrows. After a few years, the hair stopped growing back and I have very thin brows. Now, the trend is to have thick eyebrows and my mom keeps insisting that I let my brows grow back out (not realizing that they just don\u2019t grow anymore). All of this to say if YOU like YOUR eyebrows, don\u2019t change them. Your mom is the one who made a scene, not you. She should not have assumed you would just sit there quietly and bend to her will about YOUR body just because you were in public.", "I\u2019ve never seen your eyebrows, but I\u2019m absolutely sure they\u2019re perfect the way they are.

Good on you.", "NTA. Your eyebrows, your face, your body, YOUR CHOICE. It really grinds my gears when people act as if kids don't have choices just because they're kids. You told your mother what would happen if she tried to force you, and you followed through.", "NTA. I would be screaming too if someone tried to put their hands on me, no matter who it was. If your mother did have an anxiety attack, she has only her own behavior to blame. No means no.", "NTA\n\nIt's a very interesting situation here, but it comes down to basic and fundamental ideas: consent and autonomy. \n\nYou are 16, almost an adult, and your mom invited you out for HER to get her eyebrows threaded. Autonomy says you can decide yes or no, you decided yes. That yes does not mean you CONSENT to getting YOUR eyebrows threaded. It wasnt up to her to decide what you want to do. She is completely in the wrong, and while it's okay to feel sympathy for her distress, you're NOT to blame for it.", "NTA. She is using her mental health issues to manipulate you, and that is not ok. It doesn't mean her issues aren't real, but those issues do not override your consent.\n\nShe is having anxiety because she did something bad. She is experiencing consequences of her own actions, and this is not your fault.", "NTA. But also for a 16 yo screaming and kicking is defo not the way, just my opinion. Specially if your mom suffers from anxiety. You could have walk away.", "NTA but I think if you just kept saying No to the salon person, she qould bot have do e it.  They aren't going to use force and they don't want to be in this situation at all.. No need to scream.", "NTA, and I suspect your Mom was probably just being a drama queen in the aftermath. Bullies will often pivot to playing the victim when they're defeated.", "NTA. Your old enough to make these decisions for yourself. You didn\u2019t want this done and knew the only way your mom would drop it was to cause a scene.", "NTA, but you shouldn\u2019t be screaming in a public place it\u2019s rude to everyone. Mother is the AH for insisting you change something about yourself.", "She clearly understood what you had to say. She just didn't care. \n\nShe pushed you into the chair. \n\nYou are NTA.

I grew up the same way. \nMy mom once pushed me to cut my hair a certain way because \u201cI think you\u2019ll look girly and good\u201d and I ended up with a pixie cut and crying at how ugly I looked. \nYour mom should respect your boundaries and not try to cross them just because she wants you to be \u201cgirly\u201d Stand up and defend yourself, even if it makes her angry or upset.", "NTA autonomy isn\u2019t respected for children across most cultures, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok!

Your mom has no authority over your body, if you don\u2019t want your eyebrows threaded that\u2019s your choice not hers.

My mom and I have the exact same \"relationship.\" Immediately, whole-heartedly, entirely NTA. And don't you dare let her guilt-trip you about it when she recomposes herself.

So hard headed in fact they need a lesson the \"Hard way\". This would be one of those lessons.\n\nOne thing to remember for you is we come from a generation where older people demand respect and expect it no matter what...times have changed yes but teaching older people new things...welllll", "NTA. Your mom reminds me of mine, beauty and conforming to beauty standards is more important than our happiness. Please do your best to understand that her being mad at you is a reflection of her.

She practically assaulted you while trying to force you to adhere to her beauty standards.", "NTA.\n\nI was never the teen who was into makeup and did eyebrows, at a time when thick eyebrows and contoured makeup was really in (and largely still is). Being 4ft 10 with a baby face, I only really wore makeup to try and look older. It didn't work lol.\n\n I grew up realising I was queer as well, which didn't help, as someone once told me I didn't wear makeup to deliberately \"detract unwanted male attention\".\n\nI didn't want anyone to show me how to do my makeup or look older, I just wanted someone to tell me that I looked fine the way I am.\n\n\nYour mum is too obsessed with looks and is at risk of damaging your self-esteem because of it.", "NTA. \n\nYou said no. \n\nYou said how you would react if she forced you. \n\nShe attempted to force you anyway. \n\nHer methods are a good way of ensuring you go low contact as an adult should her behavior escalate.", "NTA\nShe is going to have to accept that your body is YOURS.", "My mom made me get my eyebrows waxed when I was 9.

You are not TA, your mom should have respected your boundaries.", "NTA\n\nWhat happened to her is her own fault, if she didn't want you to scream, she shouldn't have grabbed you.", "ESH except the people in the beauty salon. \n\nMom sucks for obvious reasons: trying to ambush OP, judging and criticizing her, etc, etc. \n\nHowever, while OP was justifiably upset at her mom, I think she was a minor AH because her loud screaming would be stressful and upsetting for the random strangers at the salon who wanted no part in this drama. I have a job and kids and going to a salon is a special treat. Just getting a haircut feels like marvelous, relaxing self-care. OP could have walked out of the salon. Public screaming/shaming might feel good in the moment but there are better ways to set boundaries", "My mom did this to me when I was in 7th grade with waxing my brows. I have had to upkeep them ever since. And I have thick dark hair.

Your body, your choice.", "Why not simply just walk out?", "NTA \n\nI know you feel bad because your mom is having an anxiety attack. You care about her. That's totally okay, but in no way makes you an AH. \n\nYour mom's anxiety attack was caused by her own actions. She expects to be able to push you around and it didn't go her way. I hope she will not blame you because it was not your fault. She was embarrassed because she realizes how judged she was for not listening to you as your mother.\n\nIt's not a good lesson she's teaching you. She should encourage your own autonomy in order to set boundaries with others and not be taken advantage of out in the world.\n\nI hope you get to talk to her, that she'll be willing to listen, and you both can come to the same page. She needs to respect who you are, and you can let her know how much you love her but her words and actions are hurting you every day. Good luck OP!", "NTA. I wouldn't have the balls to actually scream as you did but I don't blame you at all. I have a set comfort zone with my appearance; I'm a \"tom boy\". My whole life I've been told to wear makeup, pluck my eyebrows etc and it's heart breaking after a while. You said no. That's all that matters - stick to your guns.", "NTA at all. I caved in to peer pressure when I was a teen, and my eyebrows still haven't recovered. And I've made some more discoveries about my gender identity and presentation, and I really, really miss my old eyebrows...", "NTA.", "NTA. When I was a teen I would've paid extra of my own money for any hair/beauty tech that respected what I wanted over what my mom wanted for my head. I'm now 28 and hate needing to get my hair cut because I missed out on the bad/experimental years of figuring out what you like.", "thanks :)", "Not only this, but she also told mom EXACTLY what she was going to do as a response.  It wasn\u2019t even slightly unexpected.", "The beautician should have also refused to perform the service once OP said she didn't want it done.", "How could you be one of the few NTA for such a clear cut judgement where OP is so clearly not the asshole. What would even be an argument for YTA ? I cant even imagine one.", "I agree. NTA. Bodily autonomy. \n\nAnd just because I haven\u2019t seen it mentioned, OP\u2019s mom sounds like a narc. Didn\u2019t get her way with controlling her daughter and she\u2019s going to lock herself in her bedroom to have an anxiety attack? Yeah, okay. That sounds like the way narcissists try to make someone feel bad about making the right choice for themselves.", "thanks <3 :)", "I don't know, I think the way OP handled it was fine. She said no, her mother didn't listen. She stated what she would do if she was forced, her mother didn't listen, and she she followed through on the stated consequence. Anyone who is being forced to do something with their body that they don't want to has every right to scream, in my opinion.", "I think this one worked perfectly.", "What else could OP have done? Negotiating clearly wasn\u2019t working.", "The technician probably does the same set up in between every service. They would have had to get ready for the next client regardless so they might as well do it at that point even knowing that OP didn\u2019t want the service done. It doesn\u2019t mean they were going to disregard OPs wishes and go through with the threading just based on what the mum wanted.", "My mom used to say:  You should wear more makeup!

NO is a complete sentence. OP made it clear she didn\u2019t want it done and her mother kept pushing it. It\u2019s not to anyone to decide your appearance and what you look like.

You needed to establish a boundary and with an adult like your mom, the only way to get the message across is to cause a scene once in a while.
