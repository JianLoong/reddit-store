{"id": 14450, "submission_id": "12hihvm", "title": "AITA for telling my stepdad I don't want his last name?", "selftext": "This discussion happened two weeks ago. My stepdad brought up to me (16f) that we could change my last name to his, if I wanted to have the family name instead of being the odd one out in the house. He also told me he would love to share his last name with me and I might not be his daughter by blood but he always considered me his daughter. I told him I didn't want to change my last name but thanks for the offer. He said we could have the same last name though and I told him I didn't want his last name, that I loved my own last name and wanted to keep it.\n\nThe story of our relationship is as follows. My parents were divorced by the time I was 1 and my older sister was 8. My mom met and married my stepdad within 18 months. She and my dad shared custody of my sister and me. My stepdad came into the marriage with no children and had three boys with my mom, no girls. My sister was older and never saw him as more than mom's husband. He did try but I think he realized early on that she had decided what they were and never pushed. He was more invested in trying to become a second dad to me. There were many times he was me uncomfortable once I was old enough to realize what was going on (from the age of 5 pretty much).\n\nMy dad died 4 years ago. The last year of his life he spiraled after my grandparents, his parents, died in a car crash and then my uncle died overseas within weeks of each other. He turned to drugs and he died within a year. My sister and I were devastated. We both adored our dad and our paternal family and we lost all of them within a year of each other. \n\nMy sister got married last year and asked me to walk her down the aisle and dance with her. He also felt slighted that he was just listed as mom's husband and not a parent in the digital book thing she supplied everyone with.\n\nI think all of this has led to the moment. He and mom both expected my sister and I to see our dad way differently after he turned to drugs and especially when he died because of them. But he was still my dad and regardless of that last year, he's our only dad and was a great dad to us in the years before that, and I believe he still loved us both.\n\nMy stepdad didn't like how I turned down his offer. He told my mom about the offer and what I said. Both of them sat me down and said I was too dismissive of his feelings and that I should have given it some more consideration. He told me he's here and he loves me and he wants to feel like he won't be pushed aside for the rest of his life by me. My mom said I might love my dad but the way he turned out that last year, I should see that he wasn't perfect and be more willing to meet my stepdad for a more enriching relationship.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso yes, I am in therapy.", "created_utc": 1681132493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hihvm/aita_for_telling_my_stepdad_i_dont_want_his_last/", "score": 882, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can still be a key figure in your life even if he is not your dad. If you don't have a close relationship to him, this is just weird and you don't owe him anything more than you've already given him.

I don\u2019t think he realizes his efforts to claim you as his have pushed you away from him.

WTF is it with step parents (and their spouses) trying to insist that their step children erase the original parent in favor of the step.  I see so many of these posts on Reddit. It is totally unfair to push the child to make a choice between step and original. Furthermore it is stupid because from what I've seen the child, when pushed, opts for the original.

Tough, cause guess what? You're the child and your feelings come first.\n\nYour dad wasn't a bad person for self medicating for some significant trauma. Would it have been better if he had engaged in therapy and gotten medical supervision and drugs meant to support him through that time? Yes. But not making that choice doesn't make him a bad person, just someone who had more hurt than they could process. No one is perfect, so if that's the standard we're held to in order to be loved and for our memories to be cherished, we're all screwed.\n\nYou love your father, you cherish your connections to him, your grandparents, and your uncle. Your last name is one of those connections, one of the last strong ones. I'm sorry that your mother and stepfather can't see or respect that. Or just think your connections or potential connections to them are more important because they're still alive. That's really rotten of them.\n\nIn most countries, they will not be able to change your name at this age without your agreement, and your stepfather will not be able to adopt you without your agreement.

If you\u2019re talking about stepdad trying to develop the relationship, then I agree that\u2019s damaging to the relationship, but it\u2019s been 15 years of a relationship with OP without her bonding a little bit with her stepdad, acknowledging any contorbitutions he has made (or acknowledging him having good intentions but acting poorly) and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s nearly enough info to support the various assertions you\u2019ve made.", "This is such a lovely reply. I wish I could upvote more than once!", "As A stepparent myself, I never pushed myself on my stepsons. I think because of that they respect me and we have a great relationship. Stick to your decision.", "*step-dad\u2026\u2026 probably autocorrect", "He and my mom see me not treating him as my second dad as pushing him away. I also believe the times I didn't choose him over my dad for Father's Day events are seen as me pushing him away. But I wanted to have my dad for that stuff.", ">If the name change is more important to him than the relationship, he\u2019s missing the real point.\n\nAnd if having the same name as you, OP is so important to him, why don't he and mom change their names to match yours?\n\nNTA. Your name is your name and what you do with it is up to you. You got it for your birthday, after all.", "that doesn't mean she should see the stepdad as her father or take his last name", "nah once she makes up her mind and says no and he continues to insist...he becomes the asshole", "why should she have to? He's been very invasive clearly. No other elaboration required", "They are saying you are dismissive of his feelings, but from they said they are being extremely dismissive of your feelings. Even if a parent does something bad they are still your parent and that doesn't mean that the bad thing affects your relationship with them.", "Tell them your final answer is No and you don't want to be asked again.  You've thought it through and that is the answer.", "NTA\n\n\u200b\n\nit sounds like they want to erase your dad from your life. like he never existed. that's wierd.", "I think you already said the right thing...thanks for the offer, but no thank you.  Your name has meaning to you...and this is your decision.  I hope for your sake he doesn't keep bringing it up.  Stick to your convictions....sometimes its all we have.", "Maybe try \"It really feels like my feelings are being ignored and minimized. I feel like I am being asked to be responsible for an adults emotional well-being rather than having my emotional well-being looked after. I no longer want to discuss this with you.\"", "I don't think so. I'm pretty sure they were referring to OP's actually father.", "I don\u2019t understand his or your mother\u2019s reasoning at all - they have THREE kids together. He has plenty of kids that only have him as the father for their Father\u2019s Day. It sounds like it\u2019s because you\u2019re the youngest girl and were so young when your parents divorced, so he basically sees you as \u201chis\u201d and therefore \u201cyou reject him\u201d in his eyes or maybe it hits his ego that despite him being in your life that long, you don\u2019t see him as such. \n\nIn any case, this seems entirely about his ego and his wants and needs and feelings and none of  yours.", "Heck, I didn\u2019t change my name when I got married - I don\u2019t see why you would do this. You are who you are.", "It can also be more meaningful if your Mom and stepdad acknowledge your feelings for your Dad.", "I can see why he'd be upset but it's not your responsibility to control how he feels.", "There's nothing wrong with him offering/asking, but you gave him your answer. Your actual father not being perfect is irrelevant. You loved him and he was your father.", " it's hers! It's strange to me that anyone would expect another person to change their last name (the only last name she has had her whole life) in late adolescence. It's strange.", "So, you deciding you want your last name to stay the same is \"being dismissive\" ...but them not accepting your answer, is not being dismissive? Why do they get to be dismissive of your feelings, and your choices?\n\nNTA.", "If you read the comment I replied to carefully, you will see what I\u2019m trying to do to help with clarity. And I also give the commenter the benefit of autocorrect. I will isolate it for you:\n\nYour mom and stepdaughter are trying to dishonor his memory. \n\nNow - the OP is the stepdaughter.  So based on your comment to me is saying the stepdaughter, by refusing the step dad\u2019s last name is, is dishonoring her own dad\u2019s memory. No - that\u2019s not correct. However, if you read it as \u201cyour mom and *stepdad* are trying to dishonor his memory\u201d then that makes total sense and is agreeable to the situation - mom and stepdad are dishonoring bio-dad\u2019s memory. Hence my attempt to help with clarity.", "Your mom and \u201estepdad\u201c are the AH here, trying to push away your biological father out and replacing him.", " The relationship itself defines your relationship with your stepdad and your last name should be of no consequence in that regard. If he loves you he should accept you as you are.", "They're being too dismissive of your feelings, though. Also, changing your last name is a big thing for many people, if you don't want to do it then they shouldn't pressure you.", "You had a bio Dad who loved you despite being separated from you early on.\nHe's a parental figure but not who you see as your Dad\nYou have a name you like already 4.Changing your name is a pain in the butt. The administration required for all the legal entities is torture (this is from changing it when I married)", " Not a fan of your mom using your dad's drug abuse as a way to pressure you to being close with your stepdad. That's manipulative.", " You don't need to choose. This has to do with him and his insecurities. Maybe have a couple therapy sessions with him so he can see that and leave you alone."]}
