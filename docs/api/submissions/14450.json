{"id": 14450, "submission_id": "12hihvm", "title": "AITA for telling my stepdad I don't want his last name?", "selftext": "This discussion happened two weeks ago. My stepdad brought up to me (16f) that we could change my last name to his, if I wanted to have the family name instead of being the odd one out in the house. He also told me he would love to share his last name with me and I might not be his daughter by blood but he always considered me his daughter. I told him I didn't want to change my last name but thanks for the offer. He said we could have the same last name though and I told him I didn't want his last name, that I loved my own last name and wanted to keep it.\n\nThe story of our relationship is as follows. My parents were divorced by the time I was 1 and my older sister was 8. My mom met and married my stepdad within 18 months. She and my dad shared custody of my sister and me. My stepdad came into the marriage with no children and had three boys with my mom, no girls. My sister was older and never saw him as more than mom's husband. He did try but I think he realized early on that she had decided what they were and never pushed. He was more invested in trying to become a second dad to me. There were many times he was me uncomfortable once I was old enough to realize what was going on (from the age of 5 pretty much).\n\nMy dad died 4 years ago. The last year of his life he spiraled after my grandparents, his parents, died in a car crash and then my uncle died overseas within weeks of each other. He turned to drugs and he died within a year. My sister and I were devastated. We both adored our dad and our paternal family and we lost all of them within a year of each other. \n\nMy sister got married last year and asked me to walk her down the aisle and dance with her. He also felt slighted that he was just listed as mom's husband and not a parent in the digital book thing she supplied everyone with.\n\nI think all of this has led to the moment. He and mom both expected my sister and I to see our dad way differently after he turned to drugs and especially when he died because of them. But he was still my dad and regardless of that last year, he's our only dad and was a great dad to us in the years before that, and I believe he still loved us both.\n\nMy stepdad didn't like how I turned down his offer. He told my mom about the offer and what I said. Both of them sat me down and said I was too dismissive of his feelings and that I should have given it some more consideration. He told me he's here and he loves me and he wants to feel like he won't be pushed aside for the rest of his life by me. My mom said I might love my dad but the way he turned out that last year, I should see that he wasn't perfect and be more willing to meet my stepdad for a more enriching relationship.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso yes, I am in therapy.", "created_utc": 1681132493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hihvm/aita_for_telling_my_stepdad_i_dont_want_his_last/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can still be a key figure in your life even if he is not your dad. If you don't have a close relationship to him, this is just weird and you don't owe him anything more than you've already given him.

I don\u2019t think he realizes his efforts to claim you as his have pushed you away from him.

WTF is it with step parents (and their spouses) trying to insist that their step children erase the original parent in favor of the step.  I see so many of these posts on Reddit. It is totally unfair to push the child to make a choice between step and original. Furthermore it is stupid because from what I've seen the child, when pushed, opts for the original.

Tough, cause guess what? You're the child and your feelings come first.\n\nYour dad wasn't a bad person for self medicating for some significant trauma. Would it have been better if he had engaged in therapy and gotten medical supervision and drugs meant to support him through that time? Yes. But not making that choice doesn't make him a bad person, just someone who had more hurt than they could process. No one is perfect, so if that's the standard we're held to in order to be loved and for our memories to be cherished, we're all screwed.\n\nYou love your father, you cherish your connections to him, your grandparents, and your uncle. Your last name is one of those connections, one of the last strong ones. I'm sorry that your mother and stepfather can't see or respect that. Or just think your connections or potential connections to them are more important because they're still alive. That's really rotten of them.\n\nIn most countries, they will not be able to change your name at this age without your agreement, and your stepfather will not be able to adopt you without your agreement.

My parents too divorced when I was 1yo. My dad was involved, but not as present as yours. My mom remarried and had my brother. \n\nMy mom, step-dad and brother all had the same last name. Most of my childhood and school years I felt like the \"odd one out\". It was especially hurtful at school, when I was asked occasionally (by colleagues, or there were forms to fill) why I don't have the same last name as the rest of my family. \n\nIn my country, to change a child's name, both parents have to agree. My birth father refused to allow the change of my last name. He was adamant that I keep his last name, so that was the end of the story. It did hurt most of elementary school.\n\nIt's obviously not your case :)) But your step-dad's intentions aren't bad, so don't be mad at him.", "NTA,  I would have the feeling that both my dad's presence and my own identity were being erased, as though neither were important. And I agree, OP, it's annoying  that the first \"no\" wasn't taken seriously, and that your mom and SD think if only they KEEP ASKING MAYBE OP WILL SEE THE LIGHT ND CHANGE HER MIND.", "\"So Step Dad.... I've thought about what you said that you wanted us all to have the same last name..... Feel free to take MY last name!\"\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I'd tell them that your last name reminds you of the good times with your dad, and that with him, your grandparents, and your uncle all dead in such a short timeframe, to change your last name would feel like you were erasing him from your life.  That you appreciate the offer, but you want to keep the memory of your father alive.", "Yeesh. She said \u201cno\u201d dude, respect that! NTA.", "NTA\n\nI was thinking this would be an attempt to console you but this, sounds almost like \"claiming\" you and while that might be the extreme, but the fact that they said you were dismissive while they are being dismissive.", "A couple of weeks ago my ex husband referred to his partner of less than a year as my daughters new mum.  Uhm excuse me, what?!  Your girlfriend is certainly NOT my daughters new mum, I am her mum, and I always will be, and pushing like that is only going to result in the kids hating her.  I asked the kids if they felt that way and all 3 said hell no, but anyway.  My point is, some people think only about themselves and their own feelings, and are apparently unable to comprehend that others think and feel differently.  My ex husband is like this in a lot of ways.  Extremely selfish, always thinks he\u2019s right.  All you can do is smile and nod until you can move out.  I\u2019m really sorry for your loss", "Nta. I'm sorry for your losses and I think it's wonderful that you have compassion for what your father went through and that you understand that didn't take away from all of the years that he was a good father and what he meant to you and what you meant to him. I'm also sorry that your mom and step-dad are disregarding your feelings on this and I hope that they will come to understand.", "NTA. Your stepdad is an opportunist. He thinks that since your dad's family is gone it leaves an opening for him. It does not.\n\nStay strong and love your dad; his love will always be with you. Think of his drug use as the symptoms of grief that it was, not as a reflection of his character", "NTA\n\n\"Look,  I'm the child here.  Why should your feelings matter more than mine? You need to back the hell off. I don't appreciate you trying to emotionally manipulate me into something I never have wanted. You asked, I gave you my answer.  It's final. I loved my dad,  and just because he turned to drugs because he was mourning and grieving the loss of the rest of his family doesn't mean he was a bad person or any less my dad.  He is and will always be my dad.  Period.  It's not bad to want to have more of a relationship,  but pushing this matter is only going to put a bad taste in my mouth and push me away.  So stop it.\"", "NTA at all sweetie and I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. Also enjoy having your big sis walk you down the aisle when you get married, I\u2019m sure he thinks he deserves that honor too. He doesn\u2019t. Maybe you can move out and in with big sis when you\u2019re 18 so you don\u2019t have to deal with this bs from your mom and step dad.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for all your family losses. I would think that would make you want to keep your name even more (not that you need a reason!). \n\nI just love how he and your mom think you should be more considerate of *his* feelings while dismissing yours.", "Whats wrong with stepparents?????\n\nNTA", "That's how I feel about him and this. I don't think he's bad for wanting it. But the pushing is too much and is leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth.", "This I agree with you, it brings a sour taste to my mouth whenever a stepparent comes in and pushes a relationship onto the child even though the child has made it clear that they don't want anything like that. O p it is your choice and don't let your parents guess like you and guilt trip you into this. Your father made a mistake last year but he was in grief one year of mistakes does not replace countless years of love and he has shown upon you all that matters is that you're happy.", "If he is decent he should respect her sense of identity and embrace it. But he wants the uniformity of name for appearance\u2019s sake. If he truly sees her as a daughter he would ask to adopt her and take full responsibility as a parent. But that\u2019s not what he is asking for.", " It sounds as if you don\u2019t acknowledge the role he is playing in your life or engage with him,", "It\u2019s even more of a pain if you\u2019re not changing it due to marriage. No way would I just do it because a step parent asked me.", "I don't think that it necessarily would \"disavow\" her father to change her name (she may want to change her name someday if she marries, for instance, and that would not disavow her father). However, this is her last name! It's not just her dad's last name, it's hers! It's strange to me that anyone would expect another person to change their last name (the only last name she has had her whole life) in late adolescence. It's strange.", "I agree. I hate that my mom said it like that. But I also feel like my mom's whole idea of enriching our relationship means making it a father-daughter one and not accepting it as a stepdad-stepdaughter one.", ">Your stepfather\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t feel loving, it feels possessive.\n\nYeah and performative, judging by how he got upset that he wasn't listed as a parent on OP's sister's wedding book. Like was he mad she doesn't think of him as a dad, or just mad because of how he was listed in the wedding book that the whole family will see?", ">honor your bio family.\n\nEven if she doesn't want to \"honor\" her bio dad, maybe she just likes her name, and that would be okay too! When I think of my last name, I don't think of my dad -- I think of myself. After all, my name is my name -- the only one I've ever had. The stepdad is expecting her to change *her* name to make him feel better, and that's just weird. It is weirdly patriarchal to view women's last names as the name of whoever the most important man in their life is, rather than their own name in their own right.", "I don't like the idea of hyphenating my name. Not that there's anything wrong with that option. But it's not for me.", "There were times I would talk about dad, and he would tell me I had two dad's. When I was a small kid I was in a drama club and we did plays for Mother's Day and Father's day with the parent every year. He asked a couple of times if he could go instead of my dad. That sort of stuff.", "Who would want to be close to someone who has been trying to erase her father all her life? The constant pushing and manipulating a child to be called dad when she already has one was completely inappropriate.OP seems polite enough and no one is owed an emotional relationship regardless of a parents marriage. Usually if a child is reluctant to get close to an adult, it\u2019s for a reason. I don\u2019t know why so many people don\u2019t understand this. Stepdad\u2019s pushing for more of a relationship than OP is comfortable with is what is damaging the relationship, not OP having valid boundaries and creating distance for emotional safety.", "Don't let yourself be gaslit into something you are uncomfortable with by people you love, even if they mean well and even if you care for them. You're going to resent them for it eventually, so aside from being pressured into stuff you dislike you're not even really doing them a favor, not if their chief concern is for you. Which, if you care about being seen as a parent, it should be.", "Never lose your father. He loved you until he was not here anymore. The other bloke only wants it for himself. It\u2019s nothing to do with you & what you want/need. No consideration for you at all. Stand tall and be proud.

Don't change it. \n\n\nAlso, I'm really sorry about your dad. I lost my little brother to drugs during 2020. It's devastating. I miss him so much. His mental health and addiction issues didn't change how much I loved him or how much he meant to me or how close we were just like it doesn't change how much you loved your dad and what kind of person he was. Grief is cruel and so are drugs.", "If anything, he's being dismissive of YOUR feelings. In the end, it's not your job to manage his emotions. He can be disappointed and even hurt, but that is because he created expectations in his own mind, it does NOT mean that you did something hurtful. Both can exist at same time. You weren't unkind when you turned down the offer, in fact, you were very kind and kept the focus on what you loved and wanted (your current last name).\n\nIn response to:\n> He told me he's here and he loves me and he wants to feel like he won't be pushed aside for the rest of his life by me. My mom said I might love my dad but the way he turned out that last year, I should see that he wasn't perfect and be more willing to meet my stepdad for a more enriching relationship.\n\nIf you feel you could do so safely, you may say something like, \"Stepdad, I do love you (if you do) and respect the role you have played in my life. However, right now I feel like you are being dismissive of my own grief and my relationships with other people.While I'm sure you didn't mean it this way, your request made me feel like you are trying to erase my father and my identity.  If anything, I feel like that pushes me away, as part of loving me is loving who I am and respecting who I love. I'm sorry that you felt rejected, that's not what this is. \n\nSIDEBAR: F*#K these adults putting the responsibility of their feelings on a 16 year old who is obviously still grieving. Horrible people.\n\nAlso - Request a therapist so you can have someone else to help you navigate this. Not a family one, and individual one.", "Your mom and stepdaughter trying to dishonor his memory. Sure he had a bad last year but he's still your dad and you have good memories of him. He's part of your identity and they should not take that away from you", "He, and your mom for that matter, need to realize that they are pushing you *away*. And FFS, throwing a dead man under the bus like that? Shame on mom! NTA", " I have a dad. I have a name. I love them both just fine.\u201d", "Definitely flawed but he is still a person, we all have flaws so let's cool the vitriol. I doubt the dude is realizing what he is doing.", "Totally agree. I was just thinking of language she could use to shut it down.

You can use your stepfather's sons as a better example of what he thinks they should do for their \"new dad\". You don't have to be malicious but don't be afraid to make them uncomfortable and force them to explain their own twisted logic.", "I would tell him that you don't love him any less but your name has been your name for 16 years. You love him dearly but you are almost an adult and this name has been you for your whole life. It doesn't mean you are rejecting him.", "Try showing your mom some of these replies", "Yeah. The most charitable interpretation I can think of would be that he just figures his daughter doesn't realize how cool the idea is and if he tries he can convince her, not realizing that it comes off as puhsy adjacent to a really traumatic family situation and callously self-centered.\n\nThe worst, I guess is your idea that he doesn't really care and is just using his daugther as a virtue generator. Based on the post and the clearly emotionally intelligent daughter not having a landslide of condemnation to offer, I doubt that that is the case."]}
