{"id": 14450, "submission_id": "12hihvm", "title": "AITA for telling my stepdad I don't want his last name?", "selftext": "This discussion happened two weeks ago. My stepdad brought up to me (16f) that we could change my last name to his, if I wanted to have the family name instead of being the odd one out in the house. He also told me he would love to share his last name with me and I might not be his daughter by blood but he always considered me his daughter. I told him I didn't want to change my last name but thanks for the offer. He said we could have the same last name though and I told him I didn't want his last name, that I loved my own last name and wanted to keep it.\n\nThe story of our relationship is as follows. My parents were divorced by the time I was 1 and my older sister was 8. My mom met and married my stepdad within 18 months. She and my dad shared custody of my sister and me. My stepdad came into the marriage with no children and had three boys with my mom, no girls. My sister was older and never saw him as more than mom's husband. He did try but I think he realized early on that she had decided what they were and never pushed. He was more invested in trying to become a second dad to me. There were many times he was me uncomfortable once I was old enough to realize what was going on (from the age of 5 pretty much).\n\nMy dad died 4 years ago. The last year of his life he spiraled after my grandparents, his parents, died in a car crash and then my uncle died overseas within weeks of each other. He turned to drugs and he died within a year. My sister and I were devastated. We both adored our dad and our paternal family and we lost all of them within a year of each other. \n\nMy sister got married last year and asked me to walk her down the aisle and dance with her. He also felt slighted that he was just listed as mom's husband and not a parent in the digital book thing she supplied everyone with.\n\nI think all of this has led to the moment. He and mom both expected my sister and I to see our dad way differently after he turned to drugs and especially when he died because of them. But he was still my dad and regardless of that last year, he's our only dad and was a great dad to us in the years before that, and I believe he still loved us both.\n\nMy stepdad didn't like how I turned down his offer. He told my mom about the offer and what I said. Both of them sat me down and said I was too dismissive of his feelings and that I should have given it some more consideration. He told me he's here and he loves me and he wants to feel like he won't be pushed aside for the rest of his life by me. My mom said I might love my dad but the way he turned out that last year, I should see that he wasn't perfect and be more willing to meet my stepdad for a more enriching relationship.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso yes, I am in therapy.", "created_utc": 1681132493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hihvm/aita_for_telling_my_stepdad_i_dont_want_his_last/", "score": 2725, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can still be a key figure in your life even if he is not your dad. If you don't have a close relationship to him, this is just weird and you don't owe him anything more than you've already given him.

I don\u2019t think he realizes his efforts to claim you as his have pushed you away from him.

WTF is it with step parents (and their spouses) trying to insist that their step children erase the original parent in favor of the step.  I see so many of these posts on Reddit. It is totally unfair to push the child to make a choice between step and original. Furthermore it is stupid because from what I've seen the child, when pushed, opts for the original. (Which is a totally reasonable reaction.) I'm sorry you are being subjected to this selfish nonsense.

Tough, cause guess what? You're the child and your feelings come first.\n\nYour dad wasn't a bad person for self medicating for some significant trauma. Would it have been better if he had engaged in therapy and gotten medical supervision and drugs meant to support him through that time? Yes. But not making that choice doesn't make him a bad person, just someone who had more hurt than they could process. No one is perfect, so if that's the standard we're held to in order to be loved and for our memories to be cherished, we're all screwed.\n\nYou love your father, you cherish your connections to him, your grandparents, and your uncle. Your last name is one of those connections, one of the last strong ones. I'm sorry that your mother and stepfather can't see or respect that. Or just think your connections or potential connections to them are more important because they're still alive. That's really rotten of them.\n\nIn most countries, they will not be able to change your name at this age without your agreement, and your stepfather will not be able to adopt you without your agreement.

What's not fair is trying to turn you against him. And it's especially dirty that she would use what **happened to** your father (happened to, not \"what he did\") to taint his memory. \n\nYou are absolutely NTA, and they are huge ones.

I was well over the age of a legal adult when this happened, but it still wasn\u2019t easy. My dad started talking badly about my mother, due to her actions, but regardless she will still my mom and she loved my sister and I and was always there for us. She was killed in a car accident less than a year after they legally separated. Her boyfriend was high and driving and ran off the road, hit a tree, killed her instantly. Dad still talks about her as if they weren\u2019t married for 25+ years and expected us just to love his new wife.

And of course your dad still loved and adored you, even if he turned to drugs. Addiction is a powerful thing, believe me, I\u2019ve been down that road myself and am in recovery now. Nobody ever chooses drugs over love or family. You have to see them as two separate, but equally powerful choices. Addicts can still love you and use.

You can't force someone to have feelings for someone, and a step-parent should not replace a parent who was involved in your life. And attaching a step-parent's last name to yours doesn't guarantee that you will feel any closer to them.  It's comparing apples and oranges - feelings and name recognition.

We are often told to \u201cstop being selfish\u201d etc. All her step dad cares about is his feelings and not hers. She had a relationship with her dad. She loved him.

Yet somehow mom and step dad want to vilify him for it and make her change her last name. Wtf.       \nI like my last name. Years ago I decided I would never change it. Not even in marriage. Mostly because I like it but also because women aren\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t be, property anymore. Why does this guy have to have the \u201cbrand\u201d of his last name on her?

However I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re a guy and you haven\u2019t realized that whenever women actually stand up for ourselves, we are called a bitch (or worse). Not joking. I stood up for myself when I realized all the women at work got shitty raises and all the men got good raises. I was pissed. But I calmly sat down and discussed it with my manager and he told me I was being \u201cdifficult\u201d. That I had no right to be asking people about their raises. Tried to say it was illegal. Lol. I told him it wasn\u2019t and if someone wants to tell me what they got they can. See, It doesn\u2019t matter how nice you word it, many men out there do not want women to stand up for themselves. They\u2019ll respect a guy for doing it but women aren\u2019t treated the same. He already went to her mom to tattle on her for not just doing what he wanted.

Due to the whole patriarchal family name thing, there was no pressure to change my name, but it still felt awkward when it came up.\n\nThree decades later, I'm happy that he calls me his son (no step). There's a lot of history behind that, but a big part of that is that they never put any pressure on me to have a more intimate relationship than I wanted at the time. And because they didn't put any pressure on me, I came to really appreciate how much he and my mom cared for one another, and how they supported one another in hard times. I've also learned the importance of having the family one chooses, not only the family in which one is born. Because he was so understanding and supportive when I was a teen, I've chosen him as a second dad.

Trust me, I change my name if it meant I be in line for inheritance lol", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcOP, this right here is the perfect answer.", "This isn't meant as a reproach at all, but just something to be curious about - why don't you see him as your dad? He has been around you raising you since before you can probably remember (2?). I would assume that for all intensive purposes he has been your dad, you just seem to have two of them.  I can understand why he is probably so anxious, he has raised you since you were a baby and feels you are his daughter, but you don't feel he is your dad. You are also 100% entitled to your opinion and feelings, but I think it might be worth investigating this deeper to pinpoint exactly why.", "Idk I didn't read it", "> it doesn\u2019t follow logically\n\nBecause if there's one undeniable fact about humanity its that we're all logical 100% of of the time about everything! /s", "INFO have you talked to your sister about this and if so what does she say and if not you should.", "OP, NTA. You shouldn't have to, but you may be the one who can offer your mom and stepdad a way out of the mess they are creating.\n\nTalk to them again. Tell them:\n\n1. You see step-dad as a good man and knows that he loves and cares about you.\n2. You know that he sees you as his daughter and understand that it hurts him to not be fully embraced by you as your dad.\n3. You have absolutely no wish to hurt him. But him and your mom needing you to erase your dad is hurting you. You know your dad had challenges and wasn't perfect. Your dad never had to be perfect for you to love him. And you never had to be perfect or anything other than who you are for him to love you as his daughter.\n4. You would like for you and your stepdad to have the best relationship the two of you can have, but it will never be what either of you want if stepdad keeps pushing it to be his vision of father/daughter. And, honestly, it's a bit selfish to make it about what stepdad wants. And not truly honest to present it as \"if I wanted\" when it's really about what stepdad wants.\n5. What you want is to not have lost your dad, your uncle, and your grandparents within a year. What you want is to not be pressured into erasing your last links to that part of WHO YOU ARE. You are \\[your dad's name\\]'s daughter. You always will be.\n6. That doesn't mean you can't love and appreciate stepdad, too. It's not a competition. They are both a part of your life, just not exactly the same. But you and stepdad are here and still getting to share life and make memories. Stepdad and mom need to let those moments be natural and not make them be an erasure of your dad. You and your dad do not get to physically share new moments, and you need to be able to grieve for that instead of being given the job of making your stepdad feel like he got the father/daughter relationship he wanted by successfully erasing your dad.\n7. Ask you mom and stepdad to talk to family counselor, someone experienced with blended families and the loss of a parent. (You might be willing to see the counselor once early on to share your perspective and challenges; but it should really be your mom and stepdad meeting with the counselor for a few months before there's any attempt for all three of you to have a shared meeting.) They need time to become more open to and understanding of your perspective and position before that.\n\nIf your mom/stepdad can take in any of this and be open to counseling, there's a real chance that  you and stepdad could forge a relationship that you both are happy with and that doesn't take anything away from what you had with your dad.", "ESH.\n\nYour father chose substance abuse over his daughters.\nVery hard-to-swallow pill, but the \"idea\" of your father isn't the reality of your father.\n\nStepfather stepped up from the very beginning. It's okay for him to be a little hurt that you want to idolize the drug addict. And my words are blunt. I'm not trying to hurt you, I'm trying to contextualize things. So, I apologize on advance if it comes off as insensitive.\n\nYou're not obligated to accept a new last name, but I'm also a child of divorce: don't put parents on pedestals.", "My sister has been supporting me.", "He was around a lot longer after I was 6. I was 11 when dad ended up turning to drugs and 12 when he died. He was around the 11 years before that and was an amazing father. My stepdad is my stepdad. He has never been and will never be my dad. I only have one dad and he is the man my sister and I will always love and grieve for.", "My dad had lost so much and was in unimaginable pain. He wanted to ease that pain. That way was not healthy but he wasn't thinking fuck my daughters, I don't give a shit. I had 11 amazing years with my dad. My sister had many more with him. Those years are not changed by one bad one.", "If you don't give a shit, why are you in a space looking for perspective? This isn't a hugbox of affirmation. I contextualized how your step father might feel, but if you don't give a shit (your own words) then I guess you're just the asshole with a weird complex over choosing a father, when you don't even have to. It's the way you went about it that made it ESH, and the way you want to approach it now that I find concerning.\nNo one said your dad thought \"Fuck my daughters.\" I'm saying your dad chose substance abuse over you. He did. \n\nI thought the world of my mom and always wanted to protect her. I didn't find out until many years later that she completely changed her views on the world as a survival tactic to keep a new marriage to a genuinely abusive man. It took time to further contextualize the relationship. It didn't click at 16, or 18, or hell even mid twenties. Then it did.\n\nI think the world of my dad now, but the reality is he was such a dipshit growing up. Constantly setting up his own raodblocks and lashing out at everyone else. He grew. He changed. The ugliness is still there. If someone brings it up? I don't \"not give a shit\" I acknowledge it's an important reality of our relationship as it developed.", "I didn't say I don't give a shit, I was saying my dad wasn't thinking or saying that. Yes, my dad ended up on drugs. But he was and still is my dad. He wasn't perfect but nobody is. I still love him. He still means the world to me. He doesn't have to be perfect for me to feel that way about him and just because he's imperfect doesn't mean I am going to change the love I have for him and transfer it into my stepdad.", "My dad was sick. My dad lost his parents and his brother, his family, within a tiny space of time. He didn't abandon me. He was going through unimaginable pain and tried to make that better and it cost him, and us dearly, but that last year will never change the amazing years we had with him.", "Then this is how you plainly put it. Exactly the way you phrased it. But again, this was never an AITA post. You just wanted affirmation for how you already knew you felt. That's fine. Go spell it out for him plainly just like this, and if he's a good man he'll get it. if not, then yeah, he's an asshole. This raw honesty about how you feel is completely valid. This is what you should tell him.", "Obviously I\u2019m in the minority here, and that\u2019s fine by me. But seriously, what sounds more likely to you: \n\nOP\u2019s mother made a completely callous and meaningless statement that was *bound* to alienate her child and prevent her from getting her way, and that carries no internal sense \n\nOP, a grieving teenager, didn\u2019t record her mother\u2019s statement word-perfectly in the post they wrote up afterwards, and was also heavily influenced by their perspective and emotion about the situation, which distorted the meaning slightly", "I want to keep my name. My sister did. BIL took her name when they got married so I'm hoping for the same.", "That's how it feels. It's clear from some of the stuff he's said that he would have really wanted a daughter. But he realized early enough that there was no hope for my sister seeing him as her dad. So I got more of that attention on me and more of the pressure. It's a lot to handle. Especially when as a kid I was asked to pick him over my dad for some father's day stuff.", "It's not something he chose. I know my dad loved me and my sister and I know he was a damn good dad.", "Neither did my sister. BIL took her name and I'd like to keep mine when I get married too.", "Mom might not want to be reminded of my dad, but I do.", "I was always very close to my dad. He was very active and involved and I never liked the idea of being asked to push my dad aside for my stepdad. But when I was 5 he asked me to pick him instead of my dad for a Father's Day play (and it was not the only year he did that). He would also correct me when talking about my dad and say I have two dads. It was pushy and while he said I had two dad's, his asking to take my dad's place in stuff was not something I appreciated. It also felt very suffocating having his desire for a daughter to be put entirely on me. I think it shaped how I saw him. He's my stepdad and I have never denied that. But for me, I only have one dad dad.", "It happened more than once, where he asked to take my dad's place at the father's day play. He asked me quite a few years. It always felt unfair to put me in that position and I felt that weight of him wanting a daughter.", "This might be a key thing to point out to them. If you don't even plan on changing your name when you get married, that might be enough to make them see why you didn't give his offer 'more consideration', because you'd already considered and ruled it out in the context of marriage, why would you do it for any other reason. It shows that \"being the odd one out in the house\" doesn't phase you in the slightest and your name means enough to you to buck the status quo of changing it for marriage, so you'd decided before his offer that you were keeping your name forever. I'd also ask stepdad how he'd feel if something happened to him and your mom was having this same conversation with his kids and their new stepdad a few years down the road, trying to erase him after he's gone. It won't sit well because he knows she's helping him do it to you, so why wouldn't it be a possibility?"]}
