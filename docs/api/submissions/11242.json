His little brother (Matthew, 14) asked if he could tag along and I said sure. This isn't an uncommon occurrence - I've known my friend since we were teenagers, and I've known his little brother since he was single digits. I've always been cool with him joining us.\n\nI think we all kind of struck the childhood goldmine. Matthew is a little more sheltered than me or my friend were, but I think it's honestly for the best. He's allowed on very few social medias, and they're all monitored to some extent. I wouldn't say he's a weird kid, I would just say he's a happy-go-lucky one that's a little outdated on his jokes thanks to him not being super tapped into popular/internet culture.\n\nMy girlfriend (Amanda, 23f) is adamant about not wanting children. That's fine, everyone has their opinions on the topic. I don't know where I stand and don't feel like it's necessary for me to make a 100% certain decision about that yet. Still, whether I have them or not, I like children. Amanda doesn't. It's honestly one of my least favorite things about her, the way she talks about kids. She always rolls her eyes when she hears them crying in the store and talks about how parents need to get their 'spawn' together. I try to ignore it as to not start an argument, because I think it's something she'll end up growing out of. I don't mean that she'll ever want kids, but I assume she'll look back on the way she spoke and cringe because it's so immature and out of touch with adulthood. \n\nAnyway, my best friend and Matthew showed up to my pick me up. Usually I'll just meet them somewhere, but they were already around and Matthew asked to come in to use the restroom. While he was using the bathroom, Amanda made a comment about the fact that he was wearing some kind of graphic t-shirt that had a slogan on it. I don't remember exactly what the shirt said, but it wasn't offensive in any way other than being a little millinial-esque in its humor.  My friend gave me a \"wtf?\" look but I just dismissed it. It wasn't worth our time.\n\nAs we were leaving, Amanda told Matthew \"cool shirt, buddy\" or something, very clearly being sarcastic. I told my friend that I'd meet them outside. While we were alone, I looked at Amanda and said \"it's a good thing you don't want to be a mom, because you'd be fucking awful at it.\" When I got back home afterwards, she was gone and I haven't heard from her since.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677710147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fkgux/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_shed_be_a_terrible/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was needlessly cruel to a child!!!", "NTA, Amanda sounds exhausting in general and in this instance, she was picking on a 14-year-old for his shirt.

She sounds like a high school mean girl.", "NTA.  It's fine that she doesn't like kids, but she doesn't have to be so nasty about it.  Frankly, I wouldn't want to be around someone  that would belittle a child.  Count your blessings.", "NTA - just because your girlfriend has an opinion, doesn\u2019t mean she gets to weaponize it.

Everyone has those phases/moments. Does she think she was born cool or something? I\u2019m sure many people thought the same about her when she was 14. She\u2019s the asshole for making fun of a child. I have a friend like this too where i\u2019m cool with his brother and he does things that are odd to us too, but he\u2019s a child at the end of the day and will grow out of it. Like others have said, you dodged a bullet. She doesn\u2019t sound like a nice person.", "NTA, and be happy if she doesn't come back.", "NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet. She can feel how she wants about kids, but they are a fact of life. We all have to see them and deal with them at some point. Don\u2019t want kids? Great, don\u2019t have them. I probably won\u2019t, even though I generally love kids. But there is no need to harbor such animosity towards them. We don\u2019t have a world going forward if they aren\u2019t around. Someone who treats people \u201cbelow\u201d them like this is someone that\u2019s really just not worth having in your life imo.

It is a major red flag that she talks like this", "NTA and honestly, people who treat children with such disdain should come with warnings labels like you'd find on toxic materials and such.  It's fine to not like kids.  It is not fine to be intentionally cruel to them.  This may be an attitude she might grow out of, or may grow further into.  You never know but IMO it's not worth sticking around to find out.  You were completely accurate in your assessment but probably should have used a bit more tact in your delivery of said assessment.", "Careful. Child free by choice and anti anything kid Reddit is practically sacred around here i hope you didn\u2019t insult the way they speak about kids. \n\nNTA. But in all seriousness, I don\u2019t think GF is going to \u201coutgrow\u201d the way she speaks about kids.

It\u2019s one thing to not want kids but it\u2019s another thing to openly despise them. Does she forget that she was a child herself literally a decade ago?", "Well.. why did she get angry now? Because truth hurts? Someone had to stop this awful attitude of your gf, someone who talks like that about children should be kept away, I'm surprised you are still with her (are you? I hope she left for good and if she returns, run away). NTA.", "Justified asshole.\n\nYou know what you said was shitty, but she sounds mean and exhausting.", "NTA. I fully understand and respect people who wish to remain child free or aren\u2019t keen on being around children. However, the straight up hate is something she needs to get to the bottom of. There\u2019s absolutely zero reason to be that disgusting about kids, especially to their face. He\u2019s 14, not a crying toddler\u2026 not that it would be any better if it had been.", "NTA and if she is gone you dodged a bullet!", "NTA.\n\n1. I don't see why what you said should hurt her in any way. You only pointed out the truth. And since she does not want kids anyway and has been blatantly clear about it, why does this bother her at all?\n\n\n2. Just a PSA. Never go into a relationship expecting that someone will just change or someone will just grow out of a behavior. These sort of expectations would only end in grave disappointment for you\n\n3. And no, this isn't just about her not wanting kids. I know people who don't ever want kids but still treat children with respect and kindness because they are human beings. This is about your GF being a cruel person in general.", "She's being rude to another human being. It's a very odd movement that thinks people of a certain age don't have value or emotions the same as everyone else. 14 yo boy is very young still and he doesn't need to be made 'cool'.

She definitely should NOT be making fun of a kid\u2019s shirt, and you are probably right about her as a mom, but I think you could have gone about it in a different way.", "ESH. She's being rude about children existing. Her passive dislike would be fine if she weren't being rude TO a child. She doesn't need to make multiple quips at this child for wearing a mildly sassy statement.\n\nIMO, you escalated it with the profanity and by going there. She wasn't trying to mother this kid, or anyone, or to be seen in that light. She was making mean-girl remarks at him, which deserves a callout in its own regard.", "ESH-i get saying something in anger in the moment, but that was harsh.\nIf you might want kids you should dump her. That's a super important thing to agree on", "ESH\n\nIf Amanda doesn\u2019t want kids, that\u2019s up to her.

And even people who don\u2019t want kids don\u2019t want to hear that they\u2019d be bad parents.", "ESH, Your gf is AH for picking on a kid. You are AH because you could have articulated that instead of kicking down on her.", "ESH Amanda sucks because she was rude. You suck because instead of calling Amanda out for being so rude, you thought the meanest thing you could say was to say she would suck at being a mother, like being a good parent is the gold standard that women should be measured by. There\u2019s plenty to criticize Amanda for. She was rude to someone who did nothing to her, a person who was a guest in her home. But not being good at something she doesn\u2019t even want to do? Pretty sexist criticism.", "ESH \n\nShe does sound unbearable, and the comment was not nice. \n\nBut if that is all she said to the kid, then I don't think it warranted that harsh comment.
