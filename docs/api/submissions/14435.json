I don\u2019t know a lot about Ella yet because we only met about a month ago when she joined my soccer team, but she seemed cool and my other friends on the team were going so I went too.\n\nThe sleepover went relatively well except when her mom made us all pray before dinner (we live in an area where there\u2019s not a lot of super religious people so it was kind of weird), but it\u2019s her house so it\u2019s whatever, I just did it without complaining.\n\nThis morning, her mom woke us all up at 7 AM and told us to get dressed. It turns out today was Easter and she wanted us to go to Easter mass. I\u2019m not Christian and have never been to mass before, and neither had any of my friends. In fact, I had literally no idea it was Easter until I got woken up.\n\nAt first I thought I would just go along with it since I\u2019m usually really conflict avoidant, but when her mom said it would be THREE HOURS long, I decided that compounded with the fact that I had barely gotten any sleep last night and it was 7 AM, there was no way I was going. I said I\u2019d call my mom to pick me up, but Ella\u2019s mom started getting really upset and saying I was being \u201crude\u201d and \u201cout of my place as a child\u201d.\n\nApparently, they moved from the south where if you stayed over at someone\u2019s house, you were expected to go to church with them the next day. We don\u2019t live in the south and I\u2019ve been to sleepovers before. This is definitely not the norm here.\n\nI\u2019m now banned from Ella\u2019s house for being a bad influence. My other friends are spit. One says I should have just sucked it up and went, while the other two say that I made the right call to stand up for myself. They all agreed that they didn\u2019t want to go, though.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681101926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h7evm/aita_for_not_going_to_easter_mass/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That took a lot of guts, especially for someone who tries to avoid conflict. \n\nElla might be nice but she should have at least warned everyone that her family has an Easter tradition and that going to a 3 hour long church service was going to be required the next morning. For her guests to be awakened and pretty much forced to go or be banished is bad manners, at best. Or her mom could have told everyone up front. How rude!!", "This was a bait and switch - it was never a sleepover with church afterward, it was an Easter service hidden behind a sleepover. \n\nThey knew exactly what they were doing by not telling any of you what was happening the next morning, they just figured you'd all fall in line.\n\nYou are NTA for standing up for yourself, but your friend's mom sure is. She got pissed when you opted out because she had one less soul to collect for her church.", "NTA. I'll tell you what should have happened (I'm am adult, but lived down south in college and my family originated there). If you sleep over a friend's house for the first time over the weekend, part of the conversation the parents/guardians have is to make sure it's okay that you're sleeping over (that you have permission) and that you'd bring something with you to wear to church the next morning (basically saying we're planning to take your kid to church with us, is that cool?). This would give your folks the chance to say no for you on your behalf. Your friends parents didn't do that and that's on them. \nEaster is primarily a religious holiday, but plenty of people celebrate it in different ways, or like your family, they choose not to celebrate. It can be cool to share your faith with your friends, but it should always be clear to everyone that's what's happening, and also that you can say no thank you without being called names. I'm sorry that was your experience. I'm sure your friend's mom will calm down once she lives in your community for a while. And even if she doesn't, remember your friend actually has to live with her mom. She probably still wants to be your friend. Good luck", "NTA and I say this as a parent.\n\nMy rule has always been that any sleepover guests take part in family events however IF there is anything planned for that timeframe I make sure that the guest and family knows what will be happening beforehand.  \n\nThe conversation that should have taken place was one of: Yes you can come however it is Easter and our family tradition includes attending Easter mass the next morning.  Easter Mass will be from X to Y time.  If you don't want to do that you will need to either come another weekend or arrange to be picked up at X time.", "INFO: How\u2019s your friendship with Ella since this? Is she also offended, or is it just \u201cmy parents said you can\u2019t come over\u201d and you\u2019re still friends?", "NTA \n\nIf you were told of the religious expectations before choosing to sleepover, you could\u2019ve made an informed decision. \n\nYou were respectful and rolled with it until it crossed a boundary for you, then chose to leave. Nobody told you in advance you were expected to go to church for three hours the next morning. It\u2019s strange your friend didn\u2019t mention it (especially as you were all up late and Easter is a big deal to them)", "no one is allowed to push their religious views onto anyone. what if you were muslim? would they fast with you? or if you were jewish, would they celebrate passover with you? NTA", "NTA. If the expected you to go to church, they should\u2019ve made that clear when they invited you. Also, they shouldn\u2019t try to force people to go to a three hour mass service. It\u2019s interesting to me that they\u2019d let their daughter have a sleepover that ended on a holiday since they are so religious and obviously were going to celebrate.", "NTA. You found a solution, the mom is just upset she couldn\u2019t indoctrinate you into it.\n\n\u201cBad influence\u201d in this case just means someone who disagrees. A defence mechanism to protect fragile beliefs. You are in no way the AH here.\n\nYou did good kid, and consider that \u201cbanning\u201d a gift to you.", "You're never wrong for staying away from church. NTA", "Definitely NTA.", "Nta. You did nothing wrong, and in all honesty they probably did you a favour banning you from the house", "NTA who forces that on someone? Good for you", "Doesn't sound like a good friend.\n\nNTA", "Nothing wrong with being secular, but praying before a meal or going to an Easter service are not weird.\n\n\nNTA since you were blindsided and all, but check your attitude.", "INFO: did you give them a reason for not going?\n\nI don't think that anyone should have religion forces on them but they had expectations as did you. The tone makes it seem like you disrespected them. You were tired sure, that was a choice. Calling your mom and bailing was also a choice. They are allowed to be upset. 3 hours may be long for you but to many people in the Christian community Easter mass is one of the most joyous times of the year. It's a celebration that they invited you to. Sounds like you let your ignorance become arrogance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What Ella\u2019s mom did was not acceptable (and frankly Ella should also have stuck up for you all also). Did they give you all a heads up on the clothing that would be required? Did they give you any idea of the schedule they would be running? Of course not.\n\nAnd I should add, this is not acceptable in the \u201csouth\u201d either, and I\u2019d also bet their pastor is not likely to approve of the mother\u2019s behavior either.\n\nNTA", "I haven\u2019t talked to her since, but I\u2019ll see her at soccer practice next week so I guess we\u2019ll see.", "Weird is something different from the ordinary. If your ordinary is no mealtime prayers and no religious services then yes, those things would 100% be weird for you.", "\"I don't want to do that\" is a perfectly valid reason not to go, especially as it was a religious event just sprung on them after a sleepover (which of course they were tired after, that's how teenage sleepovers work, doubly so if your hosts wake you up at 7AM). Nobody is obligated to participate in others religious events, which you point out at the beginning of your comment before spending the rest of it seemingly trying to make OP feel guilty about not going. Then you describe OP as both ignorant and arrogant which i find kinda strange. I don't see how it's ignorant or arrogant to not want to attend a religious event. Conversely though, it DOES seem a bit both ignorant and arrogant to assume you can make people go to your religious event.", "Sure, but did OP say, 'I don't want to do that or just call her mom and leave?\n\nNot knowing about an event that is celebrated by a wide cross section of the world is somewhat ignorant. \n\nAs a guest in someone's home is a privilege and as I pointed out I think there is a disconnect in the expectations of both parties. \n\nI am not saying that OP had to go to church but their reaction to the family praying before the meal and the tone in which it was expressed does not reflect an attitude of openness but rather a level of prejudice. \n\nThink about it from the point of the friend who's house she is staying at. She made a new friend in a community that may not understand the way she grew up and/or her faith. She makes a friend that she has over for a night, maybe she had to convince her parents that it will be okay and that she just wants to fit in. Then they sit down for dinner and the freind is confused. Are their questions or just judgement? Who knows. \n\nWhy is one person's expectations worth more than another's? Does someone have the right to force religion on another? No. But that doesn't mean that the person who had the expectations of everyone going to church is wrong either. People have their own traditions. Conversation and curiosity go a long way.", "\"Does someone have the right to force religion on another? No.\"\n\nThere's your answer.\n\nAs a parent, if someone did this to my kid I'd reign hell on them for tricking them into a\n3 hours long religious indoctrination, and I would make sure to inform and warn every other parent in my kid's circle about what happened.\nYou should be respectful as a guest in someone's house, and OP sure was, but as a host you can't expect to drag your guests to church and think this is OK, especially calling them names and \"defiant\" if they refuse. Mind you, these are minors too. \n\nNTA"]}
