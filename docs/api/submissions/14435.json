For her guests to be awakened and pretty much forced to go or be banished is bad manners, at best. Or her mom could have told everyone up front. How rude!!", "This was a bait and switch - it was never a sleepover with church afterward, it was an Easter service hidden behind a sleepover. \n\nThey knew exactly what they were doing by not telling any of you what was happening the next morning, they just figured you'd all fall in line.\n\nYou are NTA for standing up for yourself, but your friend's mom sure is.

I'll tell you what should have happened (I'm am adult, but lived down south in college and my family originated there). If you sleep over a friend's house for the first time over the weekend, part of the conversation the parents/guardians have is to make sure it's okay that you're sleeping over (that you have permission) and that you'd bring something with you to wear to church the next morning (basically saying we're planning to take your kid to church with us, is that cool?). This would give your folks the chance to say no for you on your behalf. Your friends parents didn't do that and that's on them. \nEaster is primarily a religious holiday, but plenty of people celebrate it in different ways, or like your family, they choose not to celebrate. It can be cool to share your faith with your friends, but it should always be clear to everyone that's what's happening, and also that you can say no thank you without being called names. I'm sorry that was your experience. I'm sure your friend's mom will calm down once she lives in your community for a while. And even if she doesn't, remember your friend actually has to live with her mom. She probably still wants to be your friend. Good luck", "NTA and I say this as a parent.\n\nMy rule has always been that any sleepover guests take part in family events however IF there is anything planned for that timeframe I make sure that the guest and family knows what will be happening beforehand.  \n\nThe conversation that should have taken place was one of: Yes you can come however it is Easter and our family tradition includes attending Easter mass the next morning.

The tone makes it seem like you disrespected them. You were tired sure, that was a choice. Calling your mom and bailing was also a choice.

Nobody is obligated to participate in others religious events, which you point out at the beginning of your comment before spending the rest of it seemingly trying to make OP feel guilty about not going. Then you describe OP as both ignorant and arrogant which i find kinda strange. I don't see how it's ignorant or arrogant to not want to attend a religious event. Conversely though, it DOES seem a bit both ignorant and arrogant to assume you can make people go to your religious event.", "Sure, but did OP say, 'I don't want to do that or just call her mom and leave?\n\nNot knowing about an event that is celebrated by a wide cross section of the world is somewhat ignorant. \n\nAs a guest in someone's home is a privilege and as I pointed out I think there is a disconnect in the expectations of both parties. \n\nI am not saying that OP had to go to church but their reaction to the family praying before the meal and the tone in which it was expressed does not reflect an attitude of openness but rather a level of prejudice. \n\nThink about it from the point of the friend who's house she is staying at. She made a new friend in a community that may not understand the way she grew up and/or her faith. She makes a friend that she has over for a night, maybe she had to convince her parents that it will be okay and that she just wants to fit in.

People have their own traditions. Conversation and curiosity go a long way.", "\"Does someone have the right to force religion on another? No.\"\n\nThere's your answer.\n\nAs a parent, if someone did this to my kid I'd reign hell on them for tricking them into a\n3 hours long religious indoctrination, and I would make sure to inform and warn every other parent in my kid's circle about what happened.\nYou should be respectful as a guest in someone's house, and OP sure was, but as a host you can't expect to drag your guests to church and think this is OK, especially calling them names and \"defiant\" if they refuse.

If she\u2019s all preachy on you, distance yourself from her. \n\nAlso, stand your ground with your friends who said you should\u2019ve sucked it up - no one should ever force a religious service on anyone and they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of saying no to any perceived \u201cauthority figure\u201d that tries to get them to do anything like that against their will.", "NTA.

That only applied for normal church and was discussed between parents before hand anyway. Though most sleepover were on Friday night and ended on Saturday... Specifically to avoid issues with church. Especially big ones. \n\nIt was NOT normal to spring church on someone. Parents hosting would let every other parent set know \"hey, were leave for church at 8:00 Sunday morning\" and if you didn't want your kid going to church with that family... You just showed dup before 8:00 and picked up you kid. Otherwise, you sent them with church clothes. I had plenty of sleepovers (with only a few kids staying over) where some friends got picked up before church and some went to church with us and went home after. Went to plenty of sleepovers that the same thing happened. Wasn't a big deal. \n\nIt wasn't normal for that church to be holiday church (Easter, Christmas, good Friday, whatever) anyway. Holiday church was generally assumed to be a family affair and you'd go visit family all day after or just be with family at home. It doubly especially wasn't normal for that holiday church to be what sounds like a vigil service or vigil mass. Normal Easter mass isn't 3 hours- I went to mass yesterday for Easter at a literal, honest to God CATHEDRAL, like, at the head church for the Catholic faith for the ENTIRE city... And it took 1 hour, 13 minutes. My parents went to their church (different state, they still live in the south) and that took just under an hour. My grandma went to yet another service, which took a hour and a couple minutes. That's 3 churches, 3 denominations, none hit 3 hours.\n\nElla's mom is trying to guilt you and tried to spring this on you and was hoping you wouldn't argue cause she's \"the adult\".

While Catholics and a few others have a long Easter Vigil tradition (generally on Good Friday), a three hour Easter morning service is the purview of the far more fundamentalist/cultish denominations.", "Yes-definitely agree.", "I agree this sounds like fundy not Catholic.\n\nFor a Catholic, Easter vigil is on Saturday evening and often lasts 3 hours. Good Friday services are also pretty long. Neither of those is obligatory.\n\nMass on Easter tends to be long due to the pageantry but even the Pope's mass in Rome didn't last 3 hours! It is usually followed by \"hospitality\" aka food and drink, often including mimosas or other potent potables.\n\nAlso OP is past the age of confirmation so the decision to attend mass is 100% her own.

And would she seriously be okay if the shoe were on the other foot, and one of your friends hauled her daughter off to a mosque for evening prayers or a worship event from another religious tradition? I seriously doubt it. There's a lot here that makes me think she was attempting to proselytise by stealth - haul you all to church, hope that the spark of faith is kindled in your souls, and then she could pat herself on the back.\n\nShe's expecting a Christian-centric culture (with a tinge of \"everybody knows everybody else\") in a much more diverse area, and she's just going to make her daughter very lonely if she keeps this up. \n\nMy advice would be to talk to your parents about the pressure she put on you, see what their reaction is, and hit them up for ideas for what responses you should give if you find yourself in a similar situation again.

NTA\n\nGoing to service with the hosting family isn't unusual in the South, but it really depends on the type of Christian. Quite a few times the kids that stayed over were from the congregation, so that would be how they were given back to their parents, ha!", "NTA. I\u2019m Catholic so Easter and Mass on Easter Sunday is very important to me but I would never EVER dream of making someone go if they didn\u2019t want to", "NTA, you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. Plain and simple.", "NTA", "NTA - That was not cool of the mother for springing that on you. I am a Christian and we invite people to go to church, not force them against their will and then reject them if they refuse. The mother should have discussed those plans before you stayed over. \n\nWe have friends that are follow other religions or are atheists, and we hang out and love each other all the same. Why? Because they are awesome people and treat and love others the way we like to be treated and loved. We would NEVER push anyone towards something they do not know, understand, or have any interest in.", "I imagine they didn't tell anyone on purpose, because they figured they'd \"save them\" by making them go to church.", "Probably better we don't get the answers to those questions.", "Yeah, there're people in this sub who think weddings don't have alcohol, I'm sure Ella thought this was the most normal thing in the world", "Ella was probably not aware, but her mother definitely was. She said nothing until the next morning on purpose, knowing children are less likely to push back against an authority figure", "Absolutely, I would never in a million years ask one of my son's friends to come to Mass with us.  As much as I hope people will respect my home when they visit, (eg don't wreck it!) I respect my guests and would never expect them to pray, worship etc!", "Geez, that's scary. I was brought up Catholic but it wasn't that way. I personally don't believe in any organized religion. I don't belong to any.", "Yep. Super religious southerners do this to people who move down here too. Almost every classmate who spoke to me asked me what church my family goes to in my first week of school in the south. Several tried to talk me into going to theirs"]}
