It turns out today was Easter and she wanted us to go to Easter mass. I\u2019m not Christian and have never been to mass before, and neither had any of my friends. In fact, I had literally no idea it was Easter until I got woken up.\n\nAt first I thought I would just go along with it since I\u2019m usually really conflict avoidant, but when her mom said it would be THREE HOURS long, I decided that compounded with the fact that I had barely gotten any sleep last night and it was 7 AM, there was no way I was going. I said I\u2019d call my mom to pick me up, but Ella\u2019s mom started getting really upset and saying I was being \u201crude\u201d and \u201cout of my place as a child\u201d.\n\nApparently, they moved from the south where if you stayed over at someone\u2019s house, you were expected to go to church with them the next day. We don\u2019t live in the south and I\u2019ve been to sleepovers before. This is definitely not the norm here.\n\nI\u2019m now banned from Ella\u2019s house for being a bad influence. My other friends are spit. One says I should have just sucked it up and went, while the other two say that I made the right call to stand up for myself.

That took a lot of guts, especially for someone who tries to avoid conflict. \n\nElla might be nice but she should have at least warned everyone that her family has an Easter tradition and that going to a 3 hour long church service was going to be required the next morning. For her guests to be awakened and pretty much forced to go or be banished is bad manners, at best. Or her mom could have told everyone up front. How rude!!", "This was a bait and switch - it was never a sleepover with church afterward, it was an Easter service hidden behind a sleepover. \n\nThey knew exactly what they were doing by not telling any of you what was happening the next morning, they just figured you'd all fall in line.\n\nYou are NTA for standing up for yourself, but your friend's mom sure is. She got pissed when you opted out because she had one less soul to collect for her church.", "NTA. I'll tell you what should have happened (I'm am adult, but lived down south in college and my family originated there). If you sleep over a friend's house for the first time over the weekend, part of the conversation the parents/guardians have is to make sure it's okay that you're sleeping over (that you have permission) and that you'd bring something with you to wear to church the next morning (basically saying we're planning to take your kid to church with us, is that cool?). This would give your folks the chance to say no for you on your behalf. Your friends parents didn't do that and that's on them. \nEaster is primarily a religious holiday, but plenty of people celebrate it in different ways, or like your family, they choose not to celebrate. It can be cool to share your faith with your friends, but it should always be clear to everyone that's what's happening, and also that you can say no thank you without being called names. I'm sorry that was your experience. I'm sure your friend's mom will calm down once she lives in your community for a while. And even if she doesn't, remember your friend actually has to live with her mom. She probably still wants to be your friend. Good luck", "NTA and I say this as a parent.\n\nMy rule has always been that any sleepover guests take part in family events however IF there is anything planned for that timeframe I make sure that the guest and family knows what will be happening beforehand.  \n\nThe conversation that should have taken place was one of: Yes you can come however it is Easter and our family tradition includes attending Easter mass the next morning.  Easter Mass will be from X to Y time.  If you don't want to do that you will need to either come another weekend or arrange to be picked up at X time.", "INFO: How\u2019s your friendship with Ella since this? Is she also offended, or is it just \u201cmy parents said you can\u2019t come over\u201d and you\u2019re still friends?", "NTA \n\nIf you were told of the religious expectations before choosing to sleepover, you could\u2019ve made an informed decision. \n\nYou were respectful and rolled with it until it crossed a boundary for you, then chose to leave. Nobody told you in advance you were expected to go to church for three hours the next morning. It\u2019s strange your friend didn\u2019t mention it (especially as you were all up late and Easter is a big deal to them)", "no one is allowed to push their religious views onto anyone. what if you were muslim? would they fast with you? or if you were jewish, would they celebrate passover with you? NTA", "NTA. If the expected you to go to church, they should\u2019ve made that clear when they invited you. Also, they shouldn\u2019t try to force people to go to a three hour mass service. It\u2019s interesting to me that they\u2019d let their daughter have a sleepover that ended on a holiday since they are so religious and obviously were going to celebrate.", "NTA. You found a solution, the mom is just upset she couldn\u2019t indoctrinate you into it.\n\n\u201cBad influence\u201d in this case just means someone who disagrees.

Good for you", "Doesn't sound like a good friend.\n\nNTA", "Nothing wrong with being secular, but praying before a meal or going to an Easter service are not weird.\n\n\nNTA since you were blindsided and all, but check your attitude.", "INFO: did you give them a reason for not going?\n\nI don't think that anyone should have religion forces on them but they had expectations as did you. The tone makes it seem like you disrespected them. You were tired sure, that was a choice. Calling your mom and bailing was also a choice. They are allowed to be upset. 3 hours may be long for you but to many people in the Christian community Easter mass is one of the most joyous times of the year. It's a celebration that they invited you to. Sounds like you let your ignorance become arrogance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What Ella\u2019s mom did was not acceptable (and frankly Ella should also have stuck up for you all also). Did they give you all a heads up on the clothing that would be required? Did they give you any idea of the schedule they would be running? Of course not.\n\nAnd I should add, this is not acceptable in the \u201csouth\u201d either, and I\u2019d also bet their pastor is not likely to approve of the mother\u2019s behavior either.\n\nNTA", "I haven\u2019t talked to her since, but I\u2019ll see her at soccer practice next week so I guess we\u2019ll see.", "Weird is something different from the ordinary. If your ordinary is no mealtime prayers and no religious services then yes, those things would 100% be weird for you.", "\"I don't want to do that\" is a perfectly valid reason not to go, especially as it was a religious event just sprung on them after a sleepover (which of course they were tired after, that's how teenage sleepovers work, doubly so if your hosts wake you up at 7AM). Nobody is obligated to participate in others religious events, which you point out at the beginning of your comment before spending the rest of it seemingly trying to make OP feel guilty about not going. Then you describe OP as both ignorant and arrogant which i find kinda strange. I don't see how it's ignorant or arrogant to not want to attend a religious event. Conversely though, it DOES seem a bit both ignorant and arrogant to assume you can make people go to your religious event.", "Sure, but did OP say, 'I don't want to do that or just call her mom and leave?\n\nNot knowing about an event that is celebrated by a wide cross section of the world is somewhat ignorant. \n\nAs a guest in someone's home is a privilege and as I pointed out I think there is a disconnect in the expectations of both parties. \n\nI am not saying that OP had to go to church but their reaction to the family praying before the meal and the tone in which it was expressed does not reflect an attitude of openness but rather a level of prejudice. \n\nThink about it from the point of the friend who's house she is staying at. She made a new friend in a community that may not understand the way she grew up and/or her faith. She makes a friend that she has over for a night, maybe she had to convince her parents that it will be okay and that she just wants to fit in. Then they sit down for dinner and the freind is confused. Are their questions or just judgement? Who knows. \n\nWhy is one person's expectations worth more than another's? Does someone have the right to force religion on another? No. But that doesn't mean that the person who had the expectations of everyone going to church is wrong either. People have their own traditions. Conversation and curiosity go a long way.", "\"Does someone have the right to force religion on another? No.\"\n\nThere's your answer.\n\nAs a parent, if someone did this to my kid I'd reign hell on them for tricking them into a\n3 hours long religious indoctrination, and I would make sure to inform and warn every other parent in my kid's circle about what happened.\nYou should be respectful as a guest in someone's house, and OP sure was, but as a host you can't expect to drag your guests to church and think this is OK, especially calling them names and \"defiant\" if they refuse. Mind you, these are minors too. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this, but you handled it super well! Great job, really.\n\nIdk whether Ella wholeheartedly agrees with her mom\u2019s behavior or if she\u2019s more a \u201cvictim\u201d of it, but you should have a talk when you see her again and if it seems more like the latter than the former, she deserves support. If she\u2019s all preachy on you, distance yourself from her. \n\nAlso, stand your ground with your friends who said you should\u2019ve sucked it up - no one should ever force a religious service on anyone and they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of saying no to any perceived \u201cauthority figure\u201d that tries to get them to do anything like that against their will.", "NTA. This person is a freak attempting to indoctrinate minors. No way. Creepy. Good for you; sorry for your friend.", "NTA\n\nI'm from the South and people usually had sleepovers and birthday parties on Friday nights to AVOID wrangling all the kids to Church the next day. In fact the only time I've been to Church after a sleepover was when I would stay over with my cousins (not in the South).", "NTA. Some christians are encouraged to convert non christians. For all you know, inviting you over could have been a way to pressure you into going and hopefully converting. Her pointing out she was meant to have inherent authority over you as an adult further indicates this was the case.\n\nYou failing to cave has resulted in you being evicted from your friend's life. You didn't want to participate in a 3 hour 'mandatory' activity with no notice and little sleep. Well done for standing your ground. Not everyone would have.", "Nope NTA\n\n\nLook, I\u2019m Roman Catholic, I do church on Sunday\u2019s, midnight mass on Easter and Christmas. And there have been a few times I\u2019ve taken other kids with me. But I always ASK the parents if it\u2019s okay, if not, that\u2019s fine I go the next week.

Feel bad for Ella tbh.", "Yep. I grew up interfaith with a mainline Protestant mom who went to a very progressive Christian church and a secular Jewish dad and my childhood best friend was catholic and my parents eventually had to put a stop to me having sleepovers on Saturday because it became obvious they were doing it so I had to go to mass.", "Exactly!! I am not rleious and I would fight tooth and nail to support their right to practise whatever religion they choose but I will fight twice as hard for my right not to have anyone's else religion rammed down my throat.", "You did really well with this.

I\u2019m very religious. I love being Christian. But I would never *not ever* bring someone to a service, especially someone else\u2019s child, and someone who is definitely of the age they could make their own decisions. Fair enough, go home, but it was incredibly rude to try and make her go to church with you. \n\nEspecially as Easter mass can be extremely long anyway.", "NTA - that isnt typically normal in the south either so Ella\u2019s mom was lying about that. Always stand your ground against people like that.", "NTA", "NTA. \nEveryone has a right to their own beliefs. \nNo one has the right to force another person into their religious traditions. Prayer before dinner is one thing, forcing a minor to go to a three hour long easter mass, assuming their parents don\u2019t even know about it, is a whole other thing. \nBe proud that you didn\u2019t comply to that mother.", "NTA. I had a friend like that when I was a kid. My parents used to pick me up at 6 am so I didn't have to endure a very boring church that I don't believe in. \n\nI think your parents should (politely) reach out and ask if going forward they'd like to arrange morning pick ups on both sides or if they'd each like their daughters to experience each other's religious practices", ">saying I was being \u201crude\u201d and \u201cout of my place as a child\u201d.\n\nThat woman was incredibly rude and out of place as an unrelated adult, to think she could boss you around like that. NTA. Ella should have warned you.", "NTA. I grew up in the south, and while it was normal to go to church if you slept over til Sunday morning... That only applied for normal church and was discussed between parents before hand anyway. \n\nIt was NOT normal to spring church on someone. Parents hosting would let every other parent set know \"hey, were leave for church at 8:00 Sunday morning\" and if you didn't want your kid going to church with that family... You just showed dup before 8:00 and picked up you kid. Otherwise, you sent them with church clothes. I had plenty of sleepovers where some friends got picked up before church and some went to church with us and went home after. Went to plenty of sleepovers that the same thing happened. Wasn't a big deal. \n\nIt wasn't normal for that church to be holiday church (Easter, Christmas, good Friday, whatever) anyway. Holiday church was generally assumed to be a family affair and you'd go visit family all day after or just be with family at home. It doubly especially wasn't normal for that holiday church to be what sounds like a vigil service or vigil mass. Normal Easter mass isn't 3 hours- I went to mass yesterday for Easter at a literal, honest to God CATHEDRAL, like, at the head church for the Catholic faith for the ENTIRE city... And it took 1 hour, 13 minutes. My parents went to their church (different state, they still live in the south) and that took just under an hour. My grandma went to yet another service, which took a hour and a couple minutes. That's 3 churches, 3 denominations, none hit 3 hours.", "NTA, I understand what you're saying especially if you are guest at someone's house yes you're supposed to be respectful of their house but you're not supposed to be forced to go to a celebration or a religious event that you know nothing about. \n\nAnd Opie being non-catholic really said that she had a choice even if the mother thought it was rude it's more rude to force someone to go along to an event for 3 hours if the person is not interested.", "\"Three hour mass\" is kind of a tell. While Catholics and a few others have a long Easter Vigil tradition (generally on Good Friday), a three hour Easter morning service is the purview of the far more fundamentalist/cultish denominations.", "Yes-definitely agree.", "I agree this sounds like fundy not Catholic.\n\nFor a Catholic, Easter vigil is on Saturday evening and often lasts 3 hours. Good Friday services are also pretty long. Neither of those is obligatory.\n\nMass on Easter tends to be long due to the pageantry but even the Pope's mass in Rome didn't last 3 hours! It is usually followed by \"hospitality\" aka food and drink, often including mimosas or other potent potables.\n\nAlso OP is past the age of confirmation so the decision to attend mass is 100% her own. NTA in any case."]}
