Recently I found out that she has been lying to me for 2 years about being pregnant and having a baby. This \u201cfriend\u201d would tell me for the last year and a half how her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d has kept her from her child. Of course as a good friend, I wanted to help her. I agreed recently to take her to go get her child from him. I drove 2 hours to pick her up the night before and then took her the next day to get her child. I drove her 3 hours from where I lived. We had arrived at 2:46pm. When we got there she said she needed a minute to herself and wanted to go walk around, so I sat in my car by myself while she did that. Around 3:30pm I texted her and asked what time he would be there and she told me he got off at 4:30pm. I agreed to wait. After waiting for about an hour, I had texted her again and asked what time he would be there, she told me 6:00pm. At 6:01pm she texted me and said he would be there at 6:45pm. I had eventually texted her at 6:40pm and told her if he was not there at 7:00pm I would be leaving. At 7:01pm she texts me and says that he\u2019s going to take her to her daughter, which I thought was a little strange. I tried to call her and she didn\u2019t answer, so I texted her and I let her know I would be leaving regardless.I waited until 7:20pm to leave, and she never said anything to me at all. She didn\u2019t text me until 11:00pm. Well before I had receive a text from her, I ended up reaching out to her mom to see if she had spoken to her. This is where it got interesting. Her mom had informed me she has never had a child. Well I was convinced that I didn\u2019t know what was true. So I had decided my only point of contact between me and her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d was his ex girlfriend. So I messaged the ex on instagram. This ex had helped me out so much. My \u201cbest friend\u201d was extremely pissed that I reached out to her mom and the ex girlfriend. My \u201cbest friend\u201d finally decided that she was going to come clean and tell the truth, that there has never been a baby! I even tried to confront her about it after her mom told me there was no baby, and she refused to answer the question. I was so pissed and upset. Also, let me add in there she told me I\u2019m a bad friend, because I left her 4 hours away from her house and in a strange town. But am I the ass hole for doing my own investigating?\n\nEdit: here is the timeline of our friendship\n\nLet me clear a couple of things up. We started being friends in 2012. She moved 2 hours away in 2020. In 2020 I got pregnant with my son. I have been a full time single mom. I stayed in contact with her through FaceTime and I have only seen her in person 3 times from the time she moved to current. During her \u201cpregnancy\u201d I didn\u2019t see her because she used Covid as an excuse. Which I respected because I had a covid baby. Well in May of 2021 she sends me a picture and says she had her baby. She tells me on FaceTime one day that she let her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d take the baby because she was depressed. Well when she reached out to me on Thursday she said he was trying to take her daughter from her for good and get her rights taken away. So I agreed on Friday to take her to get her daughter. And that\u2019s when this shit show happened. I hope this helps a little more.\n\nAlso, I will add that maybe I was blinded by things because she told me things I could relate to.\n\nThe other part is where she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to post her\u201d because she didn\u2019t want the world to see her daughter.\n\nTo clarify the picture of the baby was her cousins baby! I don\u2019t know anyone on her dad\u2019s side also.", "created_utc": 1690184082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1583jfv/aita_for_outting_my_best_friend_of_10_years_for_a/", "score": 2356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not even sure what she was doing\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I heard he had two solariums!", "Well, I think all of Reddit gives you permission to ditch this wacko, guilt-free.", "Judging from OP's grammar, the area could be Germany (or another German-speaking country). Weird, though: I wouldn't have thought drugs are all that hard to get hold of in any of those.", "I mean if they live in rural Germany it could be hours away", "Sounds like a safe assumption. At least you know now and can get rid of whatever the hell she was scheming to do.", "NTA and this \u201cfriend\u201d needs serious psychiatric help. This isn\u2019t OP\u2019s responsibility to help her friend get help, I should note. At this point, OP should completely end the friendship and cut all ties with this person. Someone who would make something like this up cannot ever be trusted to tell the truth again and should be avoided at all costs.", "NTA- That is not your friend she never has been with those types of lies. Cut that chick off all she wants is pity and attention. She was jealous you had a baby so she had to invent one smh she has serious issues.", "NTA. She\u2019s toxic, get her out of your life.", "Wow, your friend is fucking crazy. I hope she can get some help.", "Woah end that friendship now.  That's toxic.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard to wrap your head around, but people will make up elaborate stories and keep them up. I knew a woman who claimed to have terminal cancer. In the early days, I drove her husband to the hospital when she faked an emergency and went to the ER.", "NTA obviously.\n\nWhat isn't obvious to me is where tf did she make you drive her? Where was she all those hours? What was the point of the lies for all these years?? What was her plan??", "She was frantically trying to kidnap a baby.", "I agree, NTA. I had a friend who would call in the middle of the night, needing help. I\u2019d go to help, and she\u2019d take off, expecting me to follow. The last time, I went home instead and ended the relationship. It turned out she was unmedicated bipolar. Still unmedicated. Now at 61, posts \u201chelp me\u201d notices on Facebook. All that to say, sounds like your \u201cfriend\u201d might be dealing with more than you know", "Oh my gosh. Has she always been like this or is it newer? From this post it just seems like the friend is absolutely psychotic or genuinely delusional in ways due to mental illness or drug use", "You are NTA.  If I were you, though, I would have concerns about your safety and your child's safety. I'm glad she didn't try to \"borrow\" your child. This friend sounds unhinged.  I hope she will be an ex-friend after this.", "Wait, how old is the ex boyfriend?", "Honestly not that I remember! Hearing how she is now really scares me. When we stopped being friends in high school she had gotten involved in drugs but I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s still into all that", "I just found out from him he\u2019s 18\u2026", "Wait, so she's in her mid-20's and was \"dating\" a 16 year old?", "YTA. \n\nImagine for a moment there had been a baby. An actual baby, 4 hours away. \n\nWhat exactly was it that you\u2019d initially agreed to? To kidnap a kid you knew little to nothing about? \n\nAre you effing mad?", "NTA \n\nBut don\u2019t get involved with custody disputes. \n\nIf she did have a child and you helped her get said child that could likely get you charged with kidnapping", "**NTA**. You did the right thing", "Ahh well I honestly hope she gets better from whatever she is suffering from, because putting OP through this is horrible. Wishing all of y\u2019all the best!", "Jesus christ, so she committed statutory rape, fraud, extortion essentially of a minor, and god knows what else!", "It's a good time to tune back in, stuff is getting crazy!", "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry for you \ud83d\ude22", "And that's not even the worst part; at the time, I only had a Gameboy Advance... with only the streetlights to see with! /s\n\nNo, but honestly, I appreciate it. It was a crummy time in my life, but thankfully it's been many years since and I'm (relatively) well-adjusted now, lol.", "Yes thats when it started, if not before that", "NTA\n\nI had a crazy friend like this once in my mid teens who literally lied about everything. She lied about being friends with random people, lied about having boyfriends, lied about her age to people. She once cut her forehead with a pink razor and then pretended she fell in the shower (cant remember why other than attention) and got mad when I said it looked like she rubbed her razor across her forehead. The cuts didnt match up with a single other thing in that shower.\n\nIts all for attention.", "NTA. This is the kind of scary shit that has people stealing other people's kids and telling everyone it's theirs. Drop this psycho.", "100% NTA, you went out of your way to help her and you\u2019re the \u201cbad friend\u201d. You literally have your own kid to think about. She was probably jealous of you and your kid to make up having a child", "Nope not TA", "NTA. \n\nBut where did she go?", "I\u2019ll be honest, I never got the answer to that question form her. She said she was sitting on a bench for 4 hours outside in 100+ degree heat\u2026\ud83d\ude44", "I am letting the mom of the boy handle it. I just gave them all the information and let them do what they want with it.", "I completely understand.  It's just such a shit show.", "NTA. I had a roommate like this. She (30s f at the time) told everyone she worked with that she had a son, her parents had custody to prevent his father from taking him. Kept the lie going for YEARS. Pictures of a little boy, excuses when family.fun day events occured in the company. After living with her for 2 years, and knowingher for 3 previous to her moving in, she NEVER had him over, even supervised, and when id gone to her parents with her, he was always in bed, napping/gone. If her parents were home, i couldnt go say hi. Fell apart for her when people we worked with met her father (he worked at our head office) and asked him how's Mason (fictional son) doing? He confirmed she had no kid, and he certainly wasn't raising this child; he did ask why, and others who knew her confirmed she was telling everyone this. Turns out she made shit up all the time because her younger brother had leukemia and got all the parents attention. It all fell apart when brother died (this was not a lie - several upper managers knew the family and were at the service). She tried to claim she was being bullied to hr and her coworkers were all lying about her saying this stuff because she was so great at her job (she wasnt) and we were jealous. She got herself transferred to a new office 2 hours away and moved out pretty quick when it became public knowledge. But that's not even the kicker. When she moved out? that's when I found out she was also storing all her cats litter box presents in her closet.  15 large, plastic bins, closed and taped, filled with used litter. She is now known as the Cat Poop Crazy to my friends and family.\n\nJess, I really hope you got help, because my God do I feel sorry for your wife if you haven't.", "NTA.  You are way more patient than me and your former \u201cfriend\u201d is a nut job.  I honestly cannot imagine a scenario where I would even get to that point without a clear plan.  I cannot believe you waited that long lol.", "My burning question out of all of this is why have you drive her 4 damn hours? Like what was there for her? What was she freaking doing at 11pm? Does she have a history of drug addiction??\n\nSo many questions, I'm so sorry though, that shits craaaazy", "No those are valid questions. But in all honesty I\u2019m not even sure what she was doing. Because what she said didn\u2019t add up. And plus, I don\u2019t even believe her anyways anymore."]}
