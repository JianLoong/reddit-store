Recently I found out that she has been lying to me for 2 years about being pregnant and having a baby. This \u201cfriend\u201d would tell me for the last year and a half how her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d has kept her from her child. Of course as a good friend, I wanted to help her. I agreed recently to take her to go get her child from him. I drove 2 hours to pick her up the night before and then took her the next day to get her child. I drove her 3 hours from where I lived. We had arrived at 2:46pm. When we got there she said she needed a minute to herself and wanted to go walk around, so I sat in my car by myself while she did that. Around 3:30pm I texted her and asked what time he would be there and she told me he got off at 4:30pm. I agreed to wait. After waiting for about an hour, I had texted her again and asked what time he would be there, she told me 6:00pm. At 6:01pm she texted me and said he would be there at 6:45pm. I had eventually texted her at 6:40pm and told her if he was not there at 7:00pm I would be leaving. At 7:01pm she texts me and says that he\u2019s going to take her to her daughter, which I thought was a little strange. I tried to call her and she didn\u2019t answer, so I texted her and I let her know I would be leaving regardless.I waited until 7:20pm to leave, and she never said anything to me at all. She didn\u2019t text me until 11:00pm. Well before I had receive a text from her, I ended up reaching out to her mom to see if she had spoken to her. This is where it got interesting. Her mom had informed me she has never had a child. Well I was convinced that I didn\u2019t know what was true. So I had decided my only point of contact between me and her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d was his ex girlfriend. So I messaged the ex on instagram. This ex had helped me out so much. My \u201cbest friend\u201d was extremely pissed that I reached out to her mom and the ex girlfriend. My \u201cbest friend\u201d finally decided that she was going to come clean and tell the truth, that there has never been a baby! I even tried to confront her about it after her mom told me there was no baby, and she refused to answer the question. I was so pissed and upset. Also, let me add in there she told me I\u2019m a bad friend, because I left her 4 hours away from her house and in a strange town. But am I the ass hole for doing my own investigating?", "created_utc": 1690184082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1583jfv/aita_for_outting_my_best_friend_of_10_years_for_a/", "score": 350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wtaf?\n\nDefinitely NTA but whew, I\u2019d put some distance between you bc there\u2019s nothing healthy going on there & I dunno why, but it makes me feel worried for your safety bc there\u2019s no good reason for you being the sole target of this lie nor her anger toward you over *her* lie after she left YOU abandoned with zero info in the middle of trying to do her a huge favor. That she complained about you leaving her after going AWOL & radio silent is just some incredible DARVO mess around \n\nThose are some huge lies & deeply unstable behaviour luring you to places & leaving you in the dark. Just smells sketchy & unstable enough to take an even worse turn if it escalates further \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA. she lied to you and got you to spend a whole day bored and working for her as a driver.\n\nI'd end the friendship.", "This is such a bizarre story. All this time she\u2019s never shown you (and you didn\u2019t ask) a picture of her child she\u2019s so desperately trying to get?  But she has shown you picture and the account of the alleged baby father\u2019s ex girlfriend? That is crazy.", "[removed]", "The comment-copying bots love your post.  You\u2019ve got at least three \u201cresponses\u201d from them so far, which is all of the responses at the moment I started writing this.", "[removed]", "> he sounds delusional. Impressive you put up with that at all and stayed for 4~ hours waiting on her. Its good you did your own investigation so you know the actual truth.", "She said we were meeting him at an outlet mall. And I know how she gets so I let her be. Well I also let her go by herself because she was being bitchy with me. And I also should have listened to my other friend because she had told me something wasn\u2019t adding up or making sense and she thought that my \u201cbest friend\u201d was lying", "So she said her name was Serenity but called her SJ. And I had questioned why she never posted her or anything, her response was she didn\u2019t want the world to know about her because the world is a sick place. \n\nAnd just before the comments about my 2 year old come in\u2026I allow my son to stay at his grandparents every single Friday. And yes I put my sons 2nd car seat in my car for her \u201cdaughter.\u201d And as I stated before I was trying to be a good friend thinking that the \u201cfather of her child\u201d said it was okay to take her. I had no intention to kidnap her at all.", "I\u2019m honestly not sure. I\u2019m sure her mom will get her help after this.", "I will admit I was an ass hole for even thinking it was okay. And I know where I was wrong even agreeing to that situation.", "My previous replies explain the timeline of the \u201cpregnancy\u201d and the whole run down of that.", "She did admit eventually that she does not have a child and there has not been a baby, this entire time. I talked to her mom first. Then I tried to get the truth from her. When she wouldn\u2019t tell me the truth, that\u2019s when I reached out to the ex gf and talked to the ex bf. And then once I had done all of that she had to come clean. But I had recorded our phone call and sent it to the ex bf because he deserved to know.", "I\u2019ll accept that.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And I\u2019ll add where we were it is extremely hot. We have even had excessive heat warnings throughout California. So again, not something I believe.", "Again I apologize\ud83d\ude2d there is so much and that\u2019s why I kept replying to comments to make sure everyone was getting their answers.", "The times we did the \u201cdaughter\u201d was with the dad. And when we would FaceTime or talk she would say that the dad had her. Yes I am fully aware I am very easily na\u00efve.", "No as in I agreed to meet him in a public place while he gives her, the baby back. Once she said he was taking her to her daughter I left. I didn\u2019t agree to kidnapping. I agreed to them meeting and exchanging the baby.", "Probably due to a significant recent event within the last few years that might have limited their contact.", "[removed]", ": I'm confused. How have you been friends for more than ten years, yet she faked a whole pregnancy, birth, and court case where she lost custody of her child?", "Either hooking up with a guy or doing drugs at a trap house seems like to me personally. Maybe both.", "Making a baby", "This is the same shit Kacey Anthony did. She led investigators to her \"office\" at Disney just to get to the end of a random hallway and say she didn't work there and didn't know what she was doing.\n\nSpecial kind of liar to get so caught up in their bs they insist on bringing everyone else into their delusion with them.", "Drugs", "I would have left too. Find your own way back", "I'd have given her 5 minutes, baby or no baby. I'm avoiding the traffic \ud83d\ude02", "Almost 30 years ago I waited 15-20 minutes for a friend who was just going to be a minute, and I'm still annoyed with myself that I didn't drive off and leave him.\n\nIf you wait 4 hours, you're a saint.", "Was she just out there buying stuff? Anyways cut contact with that 'friend', sounds like a complete lunatic. And be careful.", "Did you ever see her pregnant or anything? This is weird.", "Ah, so maybe the reason she fed you that particular lie was to bond with you.\n\nAnyway, you're NTA. She's properly mad. Steer clear.  Relay your version of events to any mutual friends.", "I honestly believe you and wonder if she infact lost a baby and needs therapy *and* simultaneously used you to get somewhere to do something shady, so it just turned into a big shit show. \nI'm glad you cut her off, maybe suggest to her mom she needs therapy. She could also possibly be using, which causes delusions. Or has untreated mental illness issues. \nI believe you're a good friend and sorry you got into this mess. Pathological liar, sick, confused, idk what she is but she needs help.", "You sound incredibly naive. I don't in any way understand how you could fall for this whole story.", "But you almost did put yourself in that situation. She said that he had agreed to let her have the baby yes, but you only had her word for it and it's not exactly uncommon for parents who've lost custody to get someone to help kidnap their child by telling them this exact thing. \n\nYou were extremely lucky that the lie wasn't about that but that there was a child in the first place.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", " she was so deep and so lost into her make believe world that she\u2019s unable to separate the truth from the lies.", "> I think it's likely she had a miscarriage and lost touch with reality after that.", "Weeow", "Same on the traffic. I do a lot for loved ones, but not traffic.", "That is what we think. But who even knows anymore what she really was doing. We think that was the case, but again not sure because we all blocked her.", "No. I posted the timeline of our friendship and where she moved and reasons of my own pregnancy with my son.", ">You sound incredibly naive. I don't in any way understand how you could fall for this whole story.\n\nYea and who waits for someone that long?", "Yes I agree. And I know better than to take someone\u2019s word for something. In all honesty, I was trying to be a good person. My intentions were extremely pure in this whole situation and that\u2019s where it screwed me. But now I know better and I know that I cannot just believe anything anyone says anymore, no matter how long I\u2019ve known them. And I\u2019ve also learned to not get dragged into other people\u2019s crap,", "She said for Serenity June. OMG! I\u2019ve never seen that. But I hope to god that was NOT the case!", "Yeah I really disagree with the idea she was there for a hookup. It's 3 hours away, and she was gone for 4-5 hours. Something else is going on.", "Good for you. It seems you can\u2019t trust a word this woman says and anything she does say she will use to exploit you and your kindness. Sorry you had to find out who she was the hard way.", "You don't sound like you know better. If there had been a baby, you most likely would have been aiding in kidnapping it.", "I had a friend strung out on fuck knows what play similar games with me to get money. I can believe that friend did this. Lesson learned there too. Also I'm totes a sucker apparently.", "I\u2019ve never questioned her before about honesty and now I\u2019m assuming she is"]}
