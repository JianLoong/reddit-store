Recently I found out that she has been lying to me for 2 years about being pregnant and having a baby. This \u201cfriend\u201d would tell me for the last year and a half how her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d has kept her from her child. Of course as a good friend, I wanted to help her. I agreed recently to take her to go get her child from him. I drove 2 hours to pick her up the night before and then took her the next day to get her child. I drove her 3 hours from where I lived. We had arrived at 2:46pm. When we got there she said she needed a minute to herself and wanted to go walk around, so I sat in my car by myself while she did that. Around 3:30pm I texted her and asked what time he would be there and she told me he got off at 4:30pm. I agreed to wait. After waiting for about an hour, I had texted her again and asked what time he would be there, she told me 6:00pm. At 6:01pm she texted me and said he would be there at 6:45pm. I had eventually texted her at 6:40pm and told her if he was not there at 7:00pm I would be leaving. At 7:01pm she texts me and says that he\u2019s going to take her to her daughter, which I thought was a little strange. I tried to call her and she didn\u2019t answer, so I texted her and I let her know I would be leaving regardless.I waited until 7:20pm to leave, and she never said anything to me at all. She didn\u2019t text me until 11:00pm. Well before I had receive a text from her, I ended up reaching out to her mom to see if she had spoken to her. This is where it got interesting. Her mom had informed me she has never had a child. Well I was convinced that I didn\u2019t know what was true. So I had decided my only point of contact between me and her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d was his ex girlfriend. So I messaged the ex on instagram. This ex had helped me out so much. My \u201cbest friend\u201d was extremely pissed that I reached out to her mom and the ex girlfriend. My \u201cbest friend\u201d finally decided that she was going to come clean and tell the truth, that there has never been a baby! I even tried to confront her about it after her mom told me there was no baby, and she refused to answer the question. I was so pissed and upset. Also, let me add in there she told me I\u2019m a bad friend, because I left her 4 hours away from her house and in a strange town. But am I the ass hole for doing my own investigating?", "created_utc": 1690184082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1583jfv/aita_for_outting_my_best_friend_of_10_years_for_a/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How have you been friends for more than ten years, yet she faked a whole pregnancy, birth, and court case where she lost custody of her child?", "Definitely not the asshole.  The friend is the asshole - and her level of complicity in getting you to drive her to a town 4 hours away, and then ignoring you and blatantly continuing to lie and lie and lie to you simply means that you have been used and used and used time and time again, to give her attention and for her it's really only become a vehicle to see how much she can get away with where you're concerned.  \n\n\nBlock her..  discontinue contact..  she is no friend .. nor could you ever believe her again.

She needs professional help. NTA and I highly going recommend going fully NC!", "INFO: how is this your best friend of 10+ years and you didn't know that she never had a child?", "I mean. NTA, and thankfully you've seen the light but learn from this. She very easily manipulated you and you didn't even facetime the baby at all. Very odd. To say you're best friends and to not have that much contact is wierd despite covid.\n\nAlso, she was clearly off with a random guy while you drove her there thinking you were being supermum rescuing her child.\n\nYou put yourself in a dangerous position. Sitting in a car in a random place for hours just waiting. I know you didn't think that would happen but after a few hours surely you'd have some suspicions and ask the guy what is going on? Maybe you are this trusting and its on her for abusing it, but you need to consider your safety more. Especially as you actually have a child.", "NTA this is so strange and weird to me but is there any way she could have possibly miscarried? Maybe she\u2019s dealing with stress, anxiety, PTSD from the situation.
