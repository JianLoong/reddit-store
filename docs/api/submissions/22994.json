Recently I found out that she has been lying to me for 2 years about being pregnant and having a baby. This \u201cfriend\u201d would tell me for the last year and a half how her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d has kept her from her child. Of course as a good friend, I wanted to help her. I agreed recently to take her to go get her child from him. I drove 2 hours to pick her up the night before and then took her the next day to get her child. I drove her 3 hours from where I lived. We had arrived at 2:46pm. When we got there she said she needed a minute to herself and wanted to go walk around, so I sat in my car by myself while she did that. Around 3:30pm I texted her and asked what time he would be there and she told me he got off at 4:30pm. I agreed to wait. After waiting for about an hour, I had texted her again and asked what time he would be there, she told me 6:00pm. At 6:01pm she texted me and said he would be there at 6:45pm. I had eventually texted her at 6:40pm and told her if he was not there at 7:00pm I would be leaving. At 7:01pm she texts me and says that he\u2019s going to take her to her daughter, which I thought was a little strange. I tried to call her and she didn\u2019t answer, so I texted her and I let her know I would be leaving regardless.I waited until 7:20pm to leave, and she never said anything to me at all. She didn\u2019t text me until 11:00pm. Well before I had receive a text from her, I ended up reaching out to her mom to see if she had spoken to her. This is where it got interesting. Her mom had informed me she has never had a child. Well I was convinced that I didn\u2019t know what was true. So I had decided my only point of contact between me and her \u201cdaughter\u2019s father\u201d was his ex girlfriend. So I messaged the ex on instagram. This ex had helped me out so much. My \u201cbest friend\u201d was extremely pissed that I reached out to her mom and the ex girlfriend. My \u201cbest friend\u201d finally decided that she was going to come clean and tell the truth, that there has never been a baby! I even tried to confront her about it after her mom told me there was no baby, and she refused to answer the question. I was so pissed and upset. Also, let me add in there she told me I\u2019m a bad friend, because I left her 4 hours away from her house and in a strange town. But am I the ass hole for doing my own investigating?", "created_utc": 1690184082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1583jfv/aita_for_outting_my_best_friend_of_10_years_for_a/", "score": 1182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have met someone like this before (twice) and I couldn\u2019t believe how they are capable of lying this much to a friend. It\u2019s not our fault, we believe in goodness of people but some things are just out of our control. I feel you OP.", "Honestly I knew an actual pathological liar in high school (friend of a friend, o I made nice with her, but not my friend) and she had this lie that she'd gotten married and pregnant in ninth grade and she and the \"husband\" got into a car accident and she ended up in a coma for a few weeks and lost the baby... totally forgetting or ignoring that we were in classes with her in ninth grade and would have noticed if she was missing for weeks. Like it was so obviously a lie, we were all there in ninth grade and in group projects with her and stuff and would have noticed if she went missing for weeks, and she just confidently continued insisting on the lie, sometimes changing it to deal with any questions we had. \n\nA lie doesn't have to be believable for a pathological liar. I could see this."]}
