To get straight to the point, I have an extensive dating history, and this bothers him a lot. He is working on this and we've talked about therapy for him. It affects our sex life negatively and is a self-esteem issue for him. \n\nToday, I received a text in the morning from an unknown number asking, \"Is this [my name] from [city I lived in]? I was cleaning out my contacts and found this number.\"\n\nNot knowing who this was, I said: \"Yes. Sorry, I don't have this number saved. Who is this? Might recognize your name\"\n\nHe said: \"Oh it's [his name], I think we went on a date years ago. I don't actually know what compelled me to text you but hope you're doing good.\"\n\nI did remember him, this was 5 years ago. but I didn't want to encourage him at all, since I was obviously not interested. My last response said: \"Yeah sorry, not sure. I'm engaged now though and don't live there anymore anyways. Thanks for reaching out, best of luck.\" That was the end of the interaction. \n\nI didn't think I did anything wrong but I still didn't want my fianc\u00e9 to see the texts, since it would trigger a bad mood if he saw someone from my past trying to contact me. But he was later using my phone and opened these messages and he was instantly upset. \n\nHe was throwing things and kicking stuff and yelling about this guy and how he hates that someone is hitting me up trying to have sex with me. He asked me if I remembered him, which I replied honestly that I did, and he kept saying things like \"bet it was fucking good since hes coming back for more\" and \"hope you had fun with him, hope it was worth it.\" But more than that he said I was being too nice to the guy. \n\nI was really confused about what I did wrong here. This is how I respond to people. This is not the first time this has happened and each time I respond with some variation of \"sorry, doesn't ring a bell, I'm engaged and moved out of state, good luck out there though.\" I don't have a reason to be rude and I don't get bothered by these men after this. Usually I get \"Oh congrats, have a nice life\" and then I will block their number. \n\nBut my fianc\u00e9 says I was too nice to this guy, probably because I wanted to keep him \"in the reserves,\" and I should have ignored the first text entirely. I told him I responded because I didn't know who it was initially, and then when I found out I shut it down. I was just being polite. I don't have any desire to see that man again, it was years ago.

His projection of his own insecurities will get worse if he doesn't get therapy and I suggest you allow him to have some time alone to consider what he may lose if he doesn't work on himself.

Throwing and kicking things alone should get him told to leave the house until he can stop being a toddler.\n\nPlease do not alter your perfectly reasonable behaviour to try and make your BF happy, as you're just going to keep squashing yourself down, stepping on eggshells, trying not to cause an explosion.

I\u2019m not saying get rid of him completely, or even don\u2019t marry him, just take some things into consideration before you enter a permanent marriage with him:\n\n1. He appears to be (subconsciously at least) slut shaming you. This is a result of misogyny (either his own or that of people around him) and insecurity. It results in more insecurity, making it perpetually worse.\n2. His reaction of kicking things and shouting begs the question of: is he always like this when feeling a strong negative emotion such as anger or frustration? Does it always take as little as this to set him off? Do you believe it could ever escalate into his kicking/hitting you or kicking/throwing things at you?\n3. The way you have talked about your sex life makes it seem like you are unhappy with it. This is a large part of a relationship (of course it depends on your priorities, but it is still important to make sure that there is no insecurity, jealousy, etc. in that aspect of your relationship).\n\nThese are all things I would recommend making sure are greatly lessened or, even better, fixed completely before you get married. Again, I am not telling you to get rid of him completely, but please take everything into consideration (which you probably have done, but there is a chance you have not, so it\u2019s better safe than sorry for me).\n\nNTA, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You are in an abusive relationship.", "NTA\n\nThe last time someone said these kinds of things to me was when I was with an abusive partner. No one in their right minds would fly into such a rage about this, and even if it was an actual issue for your partner (which this example should never be as there was no way you could even prevent the interaction, meaning you did *nothing* wrong), a normal human would take care to bring it up respectfully.\n\nMy abusive ex would take this kind of thing far enough that when I moved towns to start uni, he would stop talking to me for days, then start a fight because \"studying in a new city meant I would meet so many new guys and _inevitably_ fall for one of them\". When I started working and named everyone at the lab, he would fixate on any male names and say stuff like \"oh must be fun that you get to work so close to that man\". This is flat out psychotic behavior. Like what am I going to do, stay at home so there's no chance I ever meet someone of the opposite gender? That is what he would've preferred, actually. That I have no life, contacts or friends. \n\nThe fact that you felt the need to hide these messages speaks volumes - you did not try to hide them so that he doesn't find out that you did something wrong. You hid them because you *knew he would go crazy over it and it would be dangerous for you*. But the fun thing is, when you're with this kind of person it doesn't matter how careful you are. Everything you do is wrong. When I chose to omit interactions I had with men, he would say that I was clearly lying because there was no way no man had hit on me since I was always parading myself around like a thirst trap. \"It is really weird you never mention anyone that has asked you out because obviously they would, so you're definitely cheating on me\". \"Oh a guy asked you out? You've surely been giving him signs all this time\". There isn't a way to win with these people. There isn't a way to avoid them abusing you because they _want to find a reason and so they will find one_. \n\nWhen you are in the middle of it, abuse can be invisible to you, but I hope this many people online calling him out on it is enough to wake you up. Don't think all the time you've put into the relationship is wasted if you leave. No. All the time that you would spend on it from now on is what you should be worried about wasting when you could instead enjoy single life and then perhaps time with someone who respects you and around whom you don't walk on eggshells.", "The background of this page should be red.

There is never - NEVER - an excuse for him to be throwing things and kicking stuff. That's a sign of violence (and shitty self-control).  Frankly, that *is* violence - he gets angry at you and doing things that are an implied threat. \n\nHe is fucking scary. \n\nAlso, he has *no* excuse for his anger. You were completely clear about everything to this former hookup, and now your bf is throwing a fit, acting violent and whining for you to tell him how great he is.\n\nHis jealousy and irrational insecurity are not your problem.\n\nAlso, he shouldn't have been looking at your messages.\n\nALSO, you shouldn't feel like you have to hide something as minor as a message in order to avoid his bad mood. You shouldn't have to hide anything because you're afraid of how he'll react.\n\nHe is not acting like a decent person, at all. He's being controlling, jealous, and violent.", "This! You managed it quite well and still he lost his shit, and it will get worse from here. Reconsider getting married to your fiance.", "I think it would have been better if she didn't try to hide it and showed it to him the first time she got the message. That's kind of a breach of trust but I agree they shouldn't marry before he works on his issues. Or better if they are separated. It's not like she cheated while in a relationship, it's her past and she can't change it.", "yes, when we started dating I had a male best friend. We had met on OkCupid, hooked up once, and then decided to just be friends, that was 5 years ago. He'd been a close friend who had been there for me through a lot and our relationship was purely platonic. But as part of my fianc\u00e9's agreement to get therapy I had to promise never to speak to anyone I had been intimate with because it was a trigger for him. So he does restrict my male friends in some ways. He is always asking if a male friend of mine ever had sex with me.", "Come on. You really think this psycho would allow her to have male friends?

I\u2019m still best friends with an ex (not a sexual relationship tho) whose house I slept over at when dating my now husband and at first, my bf at the time was uncomfortable with the friendship and trip (understandably), but I explained that it\u2019s a matter of trust and it\u2019s on me if I break his trust, not on him. It\u2019s on him if he couldn\u2019t trust me when he had no reason to not trust me. Didn\u2019t break his trust, he learned more about my friend and saw why he had nothing to worry about, and the ex was even at our wedding and is still a best friend of mine. All that to say that ur fianc\u00e9 needs to trust you and not be so insecure bc that\u2019s what his response is. Your past is yours but he needs to accept that. My husband was my first but I was not his. It was difficult to accept, but that was something I had to work on, not make it a mode of control. He has female friends and I have male friends and we discuss any jealousy or feelings that develop and how we plan to handle it or navigate it. I hope this helps show what other relationships can look like.", "Wait, above you say you've \"talked about therapy for him.\"  That sounds like he hasn't actually gone to any therapist. \n\nAre you saying that you have up your close friend but he failed to hold up his end?
