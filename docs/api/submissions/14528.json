But in her case she weighed over 300lbs, and they were trying to control her food intake.\n\nMove out the first chance you get.", "NTA. You are legally an adult, but if you dependent on  parents for everything, you\u2019re still kind of a kid. Can you move out- financially/culturally? If not- get a job, a mini fridge and keep things in your room. As long as you live with your parents, they can set the rules\u2014 not saying they should but it\u2019s pretty common. I expect my kids to ask about desert- they are 12 and 14, usually say yes but they know they have to have finished dinner.", "INFO:\n\nWhat came first, your midnight munchies and lack of eating at the 'preordained' times or their locking up the fridge and enforcing the preordained times?\n\nCause I can definitely see both sides:\n\nKid never participates in regular meals, but does eat candy and ice cream in-between, followed by late night snacking, making parents despair and do a more strict routine.", "get your own fridge for the room and stock your own food ?\n\nmaybe get a flat now that you are no longer a kid", "Buy your own food and/or move out.  That is all so ridiculous.  Do they have nothing better to do than police your food intake?", "Just move out", "Info: do your parents lock up the kitchen because of your ed?", " I would cut contact and leave them behind.", "I was thinking this too! Wondering if the parents never had that discussion with OP because otherwise this is messed up. Either way, NTA!", "Not everyone lives in countries where it's actually easy to move out and be independent at fucking 15.", "OP is probably eating all the food and not contributing to the cost.", "Did you ask your parents for food in the home you lived in together? You probably didn\u2019t.", "OP literally said she was only eating a small piece bruh", "If OP were suffering from the Prader-Willi-Syndrome, then the parents indeed have to monitor everything OP eats and restrict food for OP's sake - locking the kitchen - to avoid risking severe health issues and even death. But OP didn't mention that they were suffering from this syndrome, so the parents might indeed just abuse their power over OP.", "Does it have anything to do with your other post from a couple of weeks ago where you said you are living in an apartment that your parents pay for? Are you living close enough (is the apartment on their property?) to go to their kitchen every night & could that be why they are upset?", "Control. THAT'S why they do this", "Well, move out then.\n\nThey are, indeed, allowed to decide if they want you to eat their food that you're not paying for.\n\nMove out, buy your own ice cream and eat as much of it as you want.", "Is she cleaning your room still?  Maybe you should take up that chore  and then she won't find your hidden stash.", "What makes you think it was easy? Are you really that ignorant that you think a child would find that easy?!\n\nMy point is that he is 20 and therefore more than capable of moving out. Stop complaining about your parents and just leave if it's soo bad \ud83d\ude44", "Of course. Unless it was discussed beforehand that I could help myself to something. Also, this isn't food, it's ice-cream, a luxury.", "Never said that. But as an adult she has options beyond complaining on Reddit.", "If it was only a piece then OP\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t feel the need to lock it up.", "She\u2019s 20. Buy your own candy, buddy.", "Because OP is 20 and refuses to pay for their own food.", "So not only sponging off them for a place to live, but also eating their food.  Yeah, OP needs to grow up and get their own place and buy their own food.", "She has never in my live cleaned my room. She actively searches regularly through my whole room to Put everything i have that she doesnt want me to have (sweets, food, some pencils (yep i dont get it too...), Sketches, one time even my Headphones she agreed a month ago that o could buy...) In the Trash...", "The economy in most countries is so bad that even most 20 year olds aren't able to move out. And btw I'm 17 and I'm gonna move out soon for college.", "I\u2019m sorry your parents had control issues, that is a shitty way to treat kids in their own home.", "Several people have asked OP if they pay for any of the food, and OP hasn\u2019t answered a single one them them.  Time for OP to grow up and pay for their own stuff.", "And your dumbass think this is recent? It wasn't something they did their entire life?\n\nThis is abusive behavior, doesn't matter it's their home. If a husband was doing this to a wife? What you would say? Or a child doing this to their elderly parent?\n\nFuck off.", "That hasn't stopped them from restricting her food to the point of giving her an eating disorder (and out of the three in the DSM this would almost certainly be anorexia, which has a *20% mortality rate, so they're actually likely killing her*) so what in the damn hell makes you think that would stop them from letting her get a job?", "OP *is* growing up. Why do you think they're asking for advice on this? We don't know *why* OP lives off their parents, so we can't judge.", "Yeah i had guessed you were young from your reply, it shows your age and lack of experience. You're stupid to assume that it was ever easy just because I said I get annoyed. I had no one and almost died numerous times so don't insult either of us by being that niave. \n\nThere are family, friends, authorities and organisations that help people in this situation in most countries. If OP is isolated and alone with only their parents and no one outside the home to offer any help then the problem is a lot more serious than being stopped from eating and they need help ASAP. This is potentially quite dangerous but they didn't say that so I assume he has family and friends who could help\n\nIt's ridiculous that a grown ass adult is being prevented from eating and has developed an ED because of this. I'm a therapist so my main focus will always be on how to prevent any more mental health problems to occur, let alone any physical repercussions that would come from these issues and the fact of the matter is, if OPs parents treat him like this at age 20 then it will not get any better and he needs to get out now.", "Doesn\u2019t even have to move out, just buy their own food.", "Entitled much? It's not shitty at all, I bet you're the kind of person who helps themselves to other people's lunch at work, too.", "Very interesting! Half the posts I read on this sub have strong comments about gender equality, but then the other half seem to have an implicit gender bias. Maybe they are different crowds, but I suspect there are some sheep that upvote already popular comments", "Ugh- it\u2019s giving off \u201cnice guy\u201d energy", "Nice", "Well if OP parents are in complete control of her and she can\u2019t do anything against their will - what is your suggestion", "Additionally, both Bulimia and Binge Eating Disorder feature varying degrees of binge eating, which is kind of hard to do when you aren't being allowed access to food. The post didn't specify, but the meals OP is allowed could very well be monitored and further restricted (if they demand the authority to refuse any and all treats, it isn't unlikely that they demand the authority to specify quantities of food eaten.) From the post, anorexia is not only the most deadly eating disorder, it is also the most *likely.*", "I\u2019m so confused as to why you\u2019re mentioning the mortality rate. I simply pointed out that OP didn\u2019t state they had anorexia, just an eating disorder lol", "Yes, the food of near strangers in a business is absolutely equivalent to the food in my own kitchen! No, I\u2019m the kind of person that doesn\u2019t think my kid should need to ask me for food in his own house. You\u2019re not a guest in your home and expecting kids to behave like that in their own homes or they are \u201centitled\u201d is frankly disturbing.", "Oh yes, because the digestive biscuits in the cupboard are so precious to me", "This doesn\u2019t even take into account if OP lives in a culture that does not allow young women to live away from home until they are married. Her parents are abusive, it is not ok to lock your kitchen so that the residents can\u2019t use it she shouldn\u2019t have to skip meals because her parents don\u2019t think she needs to eat, this is insane."]}
