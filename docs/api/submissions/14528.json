I cannot imagine doing that for an adult child. Any chance you can live elsewhere?", "NTA.   OP, there is something very strange about your situation.  Your parents\u2019 rules are not normal and it\u2019s hurting you in ways that go much further than you may realise.  It comes across as part of a pattern of abusive behaviours on their part.  I don\u2019t feel like we are getting the full story.  What is their reasoning?  Do they lock the kitchen specifically so that YOU can\u2019t get in there, or do you have other siblings?  Why are they trying to control what you eat?  Why don\u2019t you go and buy your own food?  You are an adult, so why do you still live with them?  Are they controlling other aspects of your life, like your relationships with friends or lovers?", "If ed stands for eating disorder, op already knows. NTA, please move out soon. I know everything is crazy expensive but I'm rooting for you!", "I had an adult child living at home with me and my husband, so I have some parent perspective--I do most of the cooking and shopping, so if say I knew there was an ingredient at home and planned a meal around it, then got home and someone had used it all without replacing it, it causes me an issue to cook what is planned. Similar with the ice cream if I work all day and plan to have ice cream after dinner and find someone has eaten it all and didn't let me know so I could get some at the store, I feel grumpy! So this is a situation where the parents control might be warranted, but otherwise I think OP should move out asap.", "Continued from above\u2026.Do you pay towards the food and household bills at all?  If you do then you definitely should have access to food.  Have they always had these rules about food.  Did you used to binge eat so they had to put these rules in place?  I agree that it\u2019s a strange set of rules, but it feels like a lot of the context is missing. Now that you are an adult of 20, the best thing to do is to save up your money and move out as soon as you can.", "If possible. Parents may monitor her room too.", "Please never have children", "There is also a chance that the op has prader-willi, and hasn't told us. One of the things parents tend to do to their kids is lock up fridges and have strict eating schedules to legitimately keep the afflicted from eating in extreme excess. Their \"developed eating disorder\" could also be op being formally diagnosed. Imo there is not enough info in the post to judge.", "I don't understand how you can agree that the behavior they're exhibiting means that she needs to move out while also maintaining that the behavior isn't abusive.", "I have a mom like you too, she often thinks we have a \"great relationship\" but my younger sister has already cut her off and I only haven't (yet) to protect our youngest brother. \n\nIf you think your children should immediately have to pay for food at 18 or be cut off, you're a shitty parent. They're adults but they're still your children and it is your job is to support them no matter what, not make them \"sink or swim\". If that is your mentality than I guarantee they are most likely successful in spite of you, not because of you.", "A lot of people do. And I\u2019m glad you raised your daughter in a way that she wants to take you in not all parents deserve that and mine certainly don\u2019t be getting it", "Yeah, but as I mention, there is a chance that those meals are being monitored and the amount OP is allowed to eat at those times is being restricted", "I have been in plenty of living situations that were unpleasant or didn\u2019t suit me , which I felt I should leave\n\nI have been in no living situation where I considered my housemates to be abusive", "Then the parents a.) didn\u2019t support them or b.) that person is disabled in some way and the parents should\u2019ve made preparations before they died.

Don\u2019t have kids if you don\u2019t want to love them", "This is probably the first time I've ever advised this but act like an American and throw a f****** fit! take every damn piece of food in the house and tear it open throw it on the floor take a bite out of it and tell them that you're not putting up with this s*** no more and then move out like a big boy cuz this isn't really a solution it's a temper tantrum but I promise it'll be effective", "Tell the whole story. This is clearly only a half truth. My house My rules does not track with this level of control. Be honest. Why are they regulating your food intake this way?", "I\u2019m not sure I believe this is real.", "NTA. Good heavens I treated my kids friends better than this. They all knew they could whatever and whenever they wanted food. Years later one of them told me they never had enough food at home so he relied on snacks and offers to join us for dinner. Your parents rules are ridiculous. Do what you can so you can move out asap.", "Is there anything preventing you from moving out?", "NTA. Please move out. My dad regulated (still regulates when I\u2019m around him) what I ate and how much when I lived with them. It was so freeing moving out and buying my own groceries. In general, my dad is jerk who gave me C-PTSD, but he definitely caused me an eating disorder. Sometimes when I feel bad about myself, I\u2019ll still skip eating for days, up to around a week. Please get out before this affects you - before it causes you trauma, triggers or an eating disorder.

It doesn't say they are starving op. It says that op has to ask for candies and ice cream. It also says op skips family meals and wants to snack at night. Imaging a 20yr old who skips out on family provided meals but wants to eat ice cream and candy all night that I'm assuming they don't pay for would irritate me. I could be wrong because clearly details are missing. If OP had said they have to ask to eat an apple or leftovers (luxury vs. necessity), then I'd say NTA.", "I stayed with my parents for about 9 months while undergoing cancer treatments and while I did eventually contribute to the payment of groceries, for a long time, I didn't and I could eat whenever I wanted to.", "I rarely asked my parents if I could have some food, unless it was something that was intended for dinner the next day.", "For sure.

You need to move out of your parents house.", "NTA", "Was going to say yes, because I used to lock my kitchen at night, my kid had problems and I didn't want him burning the house down or hurting himself somehow. Then I locked the fridge because he couldn't stop just raiding it constantly - not that I didn't want him eating, it's that some foods were really really bad for him, and one time I woke up to find a whole cheesecake I had baked the day before in the bin, with the base put back in the fridge. He'd do weird stuff like that all the time. I get pissy when the kids eat food we had set for dinner, or raid the desserts/treats in a selfish manner. \n\nBut this is wild, do your parents have some sort of trauma issues from their childhood?

It\u2019s ok to have to ask, in a house where someone else buys the food, if you can eat the last apple for example. It is a whole other kettle of fish to restrict your eating, force a timetable on you and lock the kitchen.   \nThere could be a number of reasons they are doing this, but each one ends with the result that you have disordered eating, possibly an ED, and no skills in looking after yourself.\n\nLeave.", "Why do you live with them?
