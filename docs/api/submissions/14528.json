You're 20 years old and your parents are abusing you with this massive control issue. I have a feeling there are other facts that you are not divulging - who the hell locks a kitchen at night?

If you lived with roommates and they asked you not to eat their ice cream and you did it anyway, then YTA, right?\nIf you want ice cream, then buy some for yourself.\nImagine how your parents feel.

You are 20, an adult and old enough to provide for yourself. If you are paying your full share of all the bills and groceries, you have every right to eat as much of your share as you like and whenever you like. If you are not paying, unfortunately, it is their food and their house. \n\nParents who use the line, 'My house, my rules!' are not helping you grow and thrive as an adult though. If parents have rules they need to explain the reason for these rules. If your parents want you to contribute to the food budget they should be communicating this to you rather than restricting your access to the food. Their behaviour is controlling and abusive, you do not deserve to be treated this way.", "NTA. Time to move out", "NTA, and your English is fine. You've speak one more language than I, so well done. You're an adult, and can make your own decisions here. \n\nIf you want to avoid arguements, can you hide non perishable food in your room?", "NTA.

Why would you consider asking for permission to eat? Sounds like a strange problem.", "Sounds like your parents have done everything in their power to make sure you end up with an earring disorder and succeeded. \n\nIf you're stuck living at home for the foreseeable future I'd ask for family therapy.

Because op is an adult their parents have to give them whatever they want ? \n\n\nOP can buy their own ice cream if it is an issue", "Neither does secretly purchasing and hiding food.

I agree that both these behaviors are in the realm of disordered eating, but eating at night in secret is absolutely better than eating nothing at all. \n\nI suggest seeking out treatment from a nutritionist and therapist after moving out, but that\u2019s not really going to help someone who\u2019s being locked out of the kitchen and yelled at for eating during the day.", "I agree , OP should move out to get out of this situation"]}
