They've answered another q but not the multiple INFO requests about this?). Complains about having to ask for food that they don't contribute towards, Reddit's response \"They Are Abusive They've Given You An Eating Disorder.\"\n\nOP go live with flatmates see how happy they are about you eating their ice creams that you don't pay for hahaha.\n\nBarring access to the kitchen is weird and sounds crazy but I suspect there is INFO missing. Maybe they were fed up with noisy cooking sounds in the middle of the night? Who knows.\n\nOP you say (in your only comment) that the only reason they give is \"their house their rules.\" That's a hint and not a subtle one. They don't want you using their kitchen as your own free-of-charge personal larder.", "No obligation?! Your parental duties don\u2019t just magically end once your kid turns 18. They chose to have her, they need to provide for her. She\u2019s *20*. Maybe she works part time and doesn\u2019t have much money. Maybe she goes to college full time and can\u2019t work at all. Her parents *chose* to have her. They need to feed her, too. It\u2019s literally bare minimum.", "\ud83d\ude02, but seriously, this is not normal parental behavior. Figure out how to get out of this living situation asap, and start getting food for yourself. In the future don't be surprised if you need a therapist to help you with a difficult food/eating patterns. We are here to tell you that you are NTA", "If this is the parent\u2019s attempts to manage an eating disorder this will end badly. No therapist or psychiatrist worth their degree would recommend physics restraints from food. But I agree there is information missing specifically why, as an adult, OP still lives at home and hasn\u2019t made a move to be on her own when she is refused access to food", "That's exactly what I meant. People should be able to eat food in their homes, whenever they want (as long as it's not specifically reserved for someone or for an event). But I can't imagine that I buy chocolate and my BF would have to ask me in our home, if he can have some. I'm just not that kind of person. Even if I was paying for everything and he never bought any chocolate himself I would still want him to feel comfortable enough to just eat some.", "See, in my house we have a cupboard of food that is free game with granola bars, apple sauce, crackers, fruit snacks, etc., but everything else the kids need to ask before eating. Granted, my oldest is 11, not 20, but even when my kids are teenagers, I will expect them to ask before getting into the ice cream. I don't know how I will treat it when they are adults.", "She\u2019s 20, she knows what is unhealthy I\u2019m sure. But having to ask to eat shared groceries in your home is just weird. It\u2019s destructive and clearly leads to EDs. Now if they\u2019re 4 years old wanting to eat candy all day, that\u2019s different. But just a snack? She shouldn\u2019t have to ask. \n\nAlso, I never said they *dont* provide. I\u2019m saying parents should. That\u2019s kind of their job.", "She\u2019s *20*.

It\u2019s literally bare minimum. Groceries are shared in a household as far as I\u2019m concerned. And OP said they never eat all of one item, and that it isn\u2019t just sweets. It\u2019s all food. That\u2019s so controlling of her parents. I never had to ask to eat something at home.", "Way past that. My kids turned into great adults and are very responsible and considerate.", "This is AN ADULT, not a girl. The thing I see that is clearly wrong is OP feels entitled to food she doesn't pay for. The parents are clearly giving her a hint to move out. \n\nWhat is stopping OP from buying her own food? I'm glad I learned from my parents how to be a responsible adult, been on my own since I was 17. My kids are grown, responsible adults as well. My parents nor I would ever put up with my adult offspring acting so entitled.", "That's totally unreasonable.", "Flatmates didn\u2019t give birth to her without her permission ??? Tf", "Right on the nose!", "You're not being down voted for pointing out other eating disorders but because you're missing the point: There's no way for OP to live in this environment without an eating disorder, so it's better that they eat at least sometimes rather than never.  If they are able to bring food into their room, that would ensure that they have some available, particularly in the hours when they are hungry but their parents are asleep.", "As someone who\u2019s struggled with a number of EDs my entire life, you\u2019re not being downvoted for pointing out that other EDs exist, but for being willfully obtuse.", "She won\u00b4t get to grow up, because SHE CANNOT EAT", "It\u2019s not like anyone can move out as soon as they turn 18. OP might still be studying and not have an income and not be paying rent, that\u2019s not abnormal and it doesn\u2019t mean anyone should be this controlling on their food or anything else.", "In *spite* of you, probably, not *because* of you", "i find that very hard to believe", "Wow your poor kids", "Sure.\n\n\n Plus, still doesn\u2019t change my original sentiment.", "You don't know her situation, maybe she needs to get married in order to be allowed to move out.", "She's 20 not 10 the infantalization is real. \n\n\nGiving birth to someone is not signing up to giving them unlimited access to your ice cream (note we are talking about junk food here not healthy stuff) for the next 50 years of your life.\n\nReinforcing the idea that this woman has no control over her life and is a victim of the people she's living off is not helpful. In fact if she's developed an eating disorder it's likely to be linked to her own feelings that she lacks control in her own life. Treating her like a passive victim (rather than someone who can exercise agency over their own life) is not likely to get her to a better place.", "Don't worry about them changing their user name, it's clearly sarcastic.

When you do, and they ruin their appetite eating whenever and whatever they want, rendering your efforts to give them a balanced diet null and void, give me your opinion on controlling their intake somewhat.
