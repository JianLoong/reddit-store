Both her grandmother and her mother wore it to their weddings. She was planning on wearing it to hers, but there was a family emergency the day before, so the wedding had to be postponed. Not wanting to wait, Bea and her husband eloped as soon as possible, and while she got to wear the dress, she didn\u2019t get to have a big ceremony with all her friends and family like she had wanted. She had passed it onto her only daughter, but it didn\u2019t fit her. I didn\u2019t realize this was going to be an issue, but the dress fit me like a glove, and now Bea is pushing me to wear it to my wedding.\n\n  \nFirst, I want to say that Bea is not a stereotypical MIL. We are actually quite close, and she is a cool, fun person. This is the first instance of her being the type of pushy MIL that you see portrayed in the media. The dress is not ugly or stereotypically vintage looking, but it has long sleeves, which will be uncomfortable in the Texas heat, and a floral pattern, which I\u2019m not a fan of. The dress clashes with the overall aesthetic of the wedding too, which is a more modern/industrial vibe, and the dress I had picked out fit that perfectly. \n\n  \nI know that it would mean a lot to Bea if I wore the dress, but I only get one wedding (hopefully) and I\u2019ve been planning it for almost a year. I will look back on the photos for the rest of my life, so it\u2019s important to me that everything is as close as possible to mine and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s vision. Additionally, I have a large-ish (\\~15k) Instagram following, and while I\u2019m not going to make decisions based on my followers\u2019 opinions, I want to make sure the photos I post on my account are reflective of what I want and who I am.\n\n  \nMy parents think I\u2019m being over dramatic and I should just wear the dress. They had originally given me $1500 to choose a dress, and said if I didn\u2019t buy a dress they would still give me the $1500 to spend however I pleased. This was pretty tempting, but I don\u2019t really need the money, and would prefer to have my dream dress. My fianc\u00e9e\u2019s sister, who I always thought was my friend, flipped out on me, told me it was just a stupid \\[redacted\\] dress, and called me a Bridezilla. My fianc\u00e9e told me I should wear whatever I want and just let everyone else deal, but now, especially after his sister\u2019s reaction, I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to piss off and alienate his entire side of the family and that it will take me a long time to live it down. I just wanted my wedding dress to be perfect, but now I\u2019m not sure what to do.  \n", "created_utc": 1693255517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163xiam/wibta_for_not_wearing_my_future_mother_in_laws/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The mil can do a photoshoot in it if it's so important. This whole issue is rude and oppressive by everyone involved, except your fiance. This isn't your burden to carry around. She needs to renew her vows and wear the dress and get on with her life.", "YWNBTA\n\nIf you think you will look back on your photos in 5 years time, and still cringe at the dress you wore, then don't do it. Its only a dress. This is YOUR day, wear what you want!", "So MIL didn\u2019t get the wedding she wanted and her response to that is to pressure you to give up the wedding you want?  Yeah, that\u2019s not how it works.  Wear the dress you want.  BTA", "NTA but maybe you choose your own dress for ceremony and photos then could wear the other dress at your reception?", "If your decision to wear a wedding dress that you,  i dunno, *like* is going to alienate your in-laws, I say, let the alienation begin.  \n\nBecause I can hardly wait to hear how your groom's charming sister and her minions are going to react when there's actually a substantive disagreement with two sides both of which one could argue with a straight face down the road.\n\nForcing the bride to wear a wedding gown she doesn't like because it will be deeeeeply meaningful to the groom's family is not a reason to wear a wedding gown you don't like.  It's your first opportunity to politely but firmly stand up to your in-laws without feeling guilty or questioning your own best instincts.  Your groom is with you on this.  Get a dress you like.\n\nNTA", "wear it and make an ig post out of it. then get a reception dress.", "NAH, why not wear both?", "NTA\n\nbut I\u2019d like to offer an idea:  wear the dress to the ceremony so you meet the \u201cfamily expectations\u201d and the dress you want to the reception?  The reception is where the heat will probably be worse for ya so you could have what you want and be happier?", "NTA, wear your dress. It could be a nice thing though, to put on the dress the day of the wedding and get some photos in it for your MIL. You're wearing it on your wedding day, she'll have some photos to evidence that but you're still getting your choice for the event itself.", "NTA.  It was nice of her to offer, but she's gone over the line by trying to arm-twist you into doing what she wants instead of what you want.  This is a test, and if you cave, you can count on MIL trying to run your life after you're married.\n\n> My fianc\u00e9e told me I should wear whatever I want and just let everyone else deal\n\nHe's right.", "A special photo shoot, wear it for the rehearsal dinner ect. If you really need to say you are concerned that the fabric is frail and you want to preserve it for future generations so you don't want to wear it to a big wedding where it's easily damaged. It's your body so you wear what you want on the actual day.", "I love this idea!\n\nAlternatively, what about wearing it for the rehearsal/rehearsal dinner? That\u2019s way the important people see it, it\u2019s part of the festivities, and there will be some photos of you in it at a wedding event.", "The mil did wear, she just didn't have a big wedding", "Or too tall", "You usually do a trial day with hair and make up, before the wedding any way so why not plan a photo shoot that day for OP, OPs Mum and MIL (and maybe SIL of she apologises for her attitude) kinda likea girls bonding day amd wear the dress for the shoot", "Depends on the wedding dress. I didn't necessarily mean at the reception itself but I see your point"]}
