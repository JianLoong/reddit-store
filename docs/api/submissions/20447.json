Don\u2019t let anyone talk you into paying her way till that has happened\u2026", "NTA\n\nCassie is really upset because Cassie got caught.

Millions of people would be thrilled to have two years' less college debt. \n\nYour wife needs to get on board with you. She is not helping her daughter at all by just erasing the lies and stealing. Allowing Cassie to get away with nearly two years of embezzlement (make no mistake, that's what this was) teaches her what, exactly?\n\nCASSIE is responsible for Cassie's education. You are not \"ruining\" anything.

Cassie\u2019s excuse she didn\u2019t know better is ridiculous.  She lied about visitors to hide her deception and has in effect been stealing from you since she dropped out.  \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right, many, if not most kids, work and take out loans to pay for college.  Cassie had the golden goose and made the conscious decision to choose deceit over her education.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry your wife isn\u2019t on board with this tough life lesson and wish you luck staying firm with your decision.  Hopefully a good dose of reality will help Cassie learn to take responsibility for her actions.", "NTA \n\nThat was a major lie. I wouldn't trust her. How would you verify if she's going to classes if you did pay for it again? She's ok being deceptive. Nah, do not pay for her again.", "NTA.  She can prove to you that she\u2019s serious about school by paying for two years of community college herself.  At that point, perhaps she\u2019s earned a second chance.  Or as you mentioned, she can take on all the loan debt.", "You're NTA. \n\n>she'd dropped out of college after the first semester, and using the college money to buy expensive things and fund her lifestyle.... She cried and said she didn't know better\n\n\nShe didn't know that lying and misappropriating your money was wrong? I wonder how long she intended to keep living this lie. Until the time she should have graduated,  maybe?\n\nIt's time for her to get a job and fund her own lifestyle. She's lucky you aren't expecting her to pay back the money she misdirected. Perhaps after a year or so of responsibly living and attending school, you might reconsider helping her with the costs. But if it were me, I wouldn't do that until she proved herself responsible and appreciative of the opportunities she had.", "NTA. She's 20 she knows better. I mean, ruin what education? She chose to drop out and not tell you.  \nInstead of using the money for education she's using the money to fund her lifestyle which she was more than happy keeping from you until someone told you.", "NTA - She's an adult and she lied to you to trick you into giving her money for over a year and a half. You were paying for her to go to college, not to do nothing. What did she think was going to happen after her time at \"college\" ended? She is reaping the rewards for her own terrible decision making.", "NTA. I have a family member that is doing something similar. It\u2019s over a decade later since this family member first went to college, and he still plays the same games with the parents. They fund the bill, and he continues to take their money on a ride. It doesn\u2019t matter what logic you present to the parents, they didn\u2019t set boundaries early on, and now they feel obligated to \u201csee this through.\u201d The parents don\u2019t see that they are actually enabling this behavior, and they can\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t pull it together. Their son is in his 30\u2019s, no job, no degree, no work ethic, and going to school part-time while he plays video games all day and doesn\u2019t have to pay for a single bill. At the moment, it\u2019s a pretty good deal for him..so I think if I were him, I wouldn\u2019t have the motivation to change anything, either. They\u2019ve made it too easy for him after he initially messed up 10+ years ago.\n\n\nYou\u2019re in the right on this. If she wants it bad enough, she\u2019ll find a way. And it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of your retirement savings.", "NTA\nShe probably realised now who else is going to fund her lifestyle hence wants to go back to college.", "NTA. If she wants to go to school, she can pay her own way now. People don\u2019t get to walk all over and betray the trust of others without making amends and demonstrating that they are deserving of trust again. Respectfully, you would be silly if you started paying the school directly right now because she SUDDENLY decided that that she *does* want to go to school after misappropriating the money you were giving her for school for two years. She can go to a community college and complete her gen ed credits on her own dime, then transfer back to her traditional 4-year university and complete her degree- at which point you can help her financially if you deem it appropriate.", "NTA. She didn't, as a full grown adult, just suddenly learn the difference between right and wrong. She is just learning, perhaps, the consequences of a bad choice between them, which in this case will not ruin her life. She can, as you properly made clear, take out a loan.", "Nta actions have consequences and I call bull to her not knowing better. My 9 year old niece knows lying by omission is still lying. And if she didn't know it was wrong why lie about the halls? Good on you giving her a chance to prove she's learnt something.", "NTA. If Cassie really wants to go back to school, she can take student loans to enroll in a community college for a certificate or to get her gen eds. If shes able to complete a program there, you can revisit helping her transferring to get a BA.", "nta\n\nshe abused your trust and she knew this was wrong and made lies to collaborate the story.", "NTA. She is on her own. You funded her bullshit lifestyle and now she is learning her lesson. Fafo.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re being generous and willing to potentially give her a second chance down the road. \n\nThat was a pretty egregious lie. \n\nTrust is a two way street and you have to earn it. She unfortunately has not met that standard.  \n\nAs a parent I feel like one of the biggest lessons we can teach our children is not squander opportunity.", "NTA.  She took money for nearly 2 years and didn't use it for it's intended purpose.  In most scenarios this is a crime.  She abused your trust, now the responsibility to pay for her lifestyle is on her, if she wants to go to college then she can pay.  If your wife thinks that her doing this for nearly 2 years is a mistake then maybe she can get a job/second job and fund your daughters college, as long as she still contributes what she currently is to the household.  This was not a mistake.  What did your daughter think was going to happen after college was supposed to finish and she had no degree.", "NTA. She lied and disrespected you by lying. This is your hard earned money meant to give her a better future not drop and have extravagant stuff. Punishment fits the crime in my opinion. I would suggest she pays on her own for the time period she missed and has to catch up, afterwards continue paying, but directly to the school. Or if she doesnt want to do college that is fine, she can get a job and pay her way and have the extravagant lifestyle.\nYou use the money on something else\ud83d\ude09", "NTA\n\nI know its your daughter, but, exchange her place with anyone in the world and what would you do?  \n\nYour dilemma, \n\n* Dont help with college and take yourself out of the equation but leave her future in her hands\n* Continue to fully fund and she really hasnt been punished or learned accountability\n* Help and be able to monitor her progress but appear as if you are the oppressor\n* Make her pay next semester (or two) to incur hardship, give the appearance of \"paying you back\" and give her some visual of the strain you go through for her.  Set parameters with this and goals to be achieved", "NTA she was more than old enough to realize her many actions would have consequences. She had to know you guys would be finding out someday. She is just upset because she got caught before figuring a way to tell you both. She consciously lied and continued to lie and not a small white lie either. She is an adult making adult decisions, she should be treated like one now too. Yes you don\u2019t want to hinder her education and bad judgment or choices do happen, but I think letting her take out her own loans and let that trust build back up before dishing out more financial assistance is what she needs. She is not a child anymore and needs to see what it\u2019s like in the real world when there is not someone you can always fall back on or expect someone to pay your way. She will always know she is loved even with boundaries.", "NTA. Your wife needs to have your back. If this hadn't come to light, when would Cassie have spilled the beans? How long would she have kept the wool over your eyes? She can't be trusted, until she earns back your trust.", "NTA. She wants to study accounting and if she wants to get her professional qualification, the professional bodies have mandatory modules on ethics and integrity. She should learn how to walk the talk.", "I was so ready to say YTA after the title but after reading, deffo NTA. You\u2019re right and seems like you are invested in how she turns out as a person.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it was a stupid move to give Cassie the money direct. You were treating her like the adult she is and allowing her to take responsibility for her future. She betrayed that trust by stealing from you for 2 years and then claimed she didn\u2019t know any better!!\n\nHas she even apologised for what she\u2019s done? I would suggest at a bare minimum she needs to get a job and start paying back all the money she stole. Maybe once she\u2019s paid you back you can revisit her education options but as it stands you have no obligation to fund anything.", "NTA. It's a betrayal of your trust and sacrifice. She is an adult so she should realise the consequences. And honestly, with such a deception, I don't think accountancy is a suitable career path for her.", "NTA, she straight up lied and used you.\nAlso I\u2019d have a serious talk with your wife, seems like she knew about all this to me", "Young ppl are dumb, their brains are developing, they make poor choices. It took me way longer than it should have to mature and realize right from wrong. I only say that because there are a lot of saints here in these comments.\n\nNTA. Trust has to be rebuilt, she doesn\u2019t get to steal and experience no consequences, and you\u2019re absolutely right she should take out loans and show she\u2019s serious. But if she does, I would resume paying. Or help with loans afterward, or with a masters or something. I don\u2019t think people realize how crippling debt from education can be. If you can help after she shows maturity I hope you do", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s 20, and it sounds like she weaved a little web of lies to keep this going for over a year. Do you really believe she didn\u2019t know better and it was an honest mistake? I don\u2019t. She\u2019s just upset she got caught.", "there are plenty of part time evening accounting college courses - some that do not take very long to get a certificate - payroll etc.\n\nShe can get an entry level job in an office doing AP or AR and take night classes.  If she shows willingness to work, then if I were in your situation I would consider funding the night classes.\n\nOften evening classes are the route for accounting field - experience with ERP system and hands on AP AR GL transactions is more valuable to learn first.", "if she\u2019s serious about going to college, she can take out the loans and then you pay off the loans when she graduates? if that\u2019s possible", "NTA, but mom\u2019s suggestion is the best.  Pay only invoices issued from the school, to the school.  Cassie needs to get a part time job to pay back the monies stolen.  Let this be a fire under your kid to get a degree and work.  Don\u2019t let it become a permanent impediment in your relationship.", "NTA. You don't have to pay, especially after she violated your trust.\n\nBut I would consider paying the college directly. Your daughter is still immature and her pre-frontal cortex is not fully developed yet. Don't let her stupid decisions derail her for life.", "NTA, but I could think of a more reasonable compromise. Cassie pays for the 2 years you already paid for, you pay for the remaining 2 years, after she\u2019s already paid for the initial 2. Maybe after her graduating, you\u2019ll reconsider and help her pay off the loans. Maybe not, but I think that\u2019s a more fair compromise that won\u2019t make her resent you in her adult life. You need to remember she\u2019s got a sister who she\u2019s comparing herself to, including her relationship with you. It\u2019s not fair to you, but I\u2019d think about a different compromise for the sake of the relationship.", "Odds are there's more going on here than someone dropping out just to live an easy life. I expect something happened: she couldn't handle academic life, or she got caught cheating and expelled, or some other event happened. And she couldn't or opted to not tell her parents. So they went on thinking she was in school, she went on cashing the checks...\n\nUntil it all fell apart.", "What's your endgame on this? What if it's that Cassie never goes to college? Is that the victory you're after?", "NTA but I wonder why you think your wife doesn't get a say in the matter. Do you keep your money separate and were you the only one paying for the college?", "I'm undecided between NTA and ESH. \n\nYou can't do something like that if your wife (if she's Cassie's mother) isn't on board. This is not a decision you can just make alone.\n\nAnd just one thing to consider: your daughter is extremely bad with money (and seems quite immature), do you think that she'll manage to get an education now, without your money when she didn't manage before, when you were helping her?\n\nI think it would be a good idea to make a specific plan now. What does she have to do now to get your trust back? And what will she do about her future?\nThis is something you and your family should discuss and set clear goals (I'm not saying you absolutely have to pay for college again, there's a lot of ways to help her out.)", "NTA, but have a conversation with your wife about it. Maybe you guys can set aside the money to pay off or pay down the loans as soon as Cassie graduates, if you two can agree that's the right path forward - but this time around, the risk should be on her.", "ESH\n\nWhat Cassie did is wrong, definitely agree. But people fuck up and deserve second chances. You're not a random stranger. You're her dad. If she can't lean on you for support, then who will she go to?\n\nAn extremely dumb move on your part to hand the money directly to her. Not saying what she did is right but seriously, how many people would be able to resist that temptation? Your wife is correct, you can pay directly to the school from now so you know Cassie can't use it for anything else. Maybe she was struggling in her classes and felt she didn't have any other option so she hid it from you, so get her help if she needs it too.", "Each child is a different experience. Technically you did all the right things and I get you are disappointed but you have to understand children will disappoint you. Your child was probably overwhelmed after the first semester panicked and found an unhealthy coping mechanism. Any person with fully developed brain would\u2019ve known this arrangement wasn\u2019t gonna end well but she is a child yes young adult but still very young. We all learn through mistakes we make. You are right she broke your trust but your wife is also right. She can try again and you can directly pay the school. Give a try again see if this was the wake up call needed. You need to cope with your disappointment and put your child\u2019s future ahead of your emotions. Many people looking at it mechanically will agree with your approach but I\u2019m telling you as the kid who fucked up and thanks to my dad punishing me a different way then by putting me in a different school and I became an honors student, moved to America had a very successful career. I\u2019m the fuck up problem child turned into success and I\u2019m trying to give you a different perspective from your child\u2019s perspective as someone who managed to turned things around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What a betrayal. I'm sorry for you and your wife.", "I messed up a couple of semesters and my dad said instead of paying for college I will reimburse you for every successful semester you complete. So if I fucked around and didn't do what I was supposed to it was on me. If I did what I was supposed to I had the next semester paid for", "A mistake? It was on going for how long? And by how many lies?", "First off she is not a child, she is a 20 year old adult who has to learn to deal with the consequences of her actions. \n\nShe knew exactly what she was doing when she lied to you regarding the \u201cstudent housing\u2019s rule\u201d and used you like a piggy bank to fund her lifestyle.(with her being college aged I assume partying etc) It would be different if she invested the money you gave her.\n\nIf Cassie truly wants to go back to college and you want to help out, fine, you can make payments directly to the school and cut her out as the middle man. There are so many people who take out loans and work full time to fund their education. We would have been thrilled to have the same help you provided.\n\nAt the end of the day OP that\u2019s YOUR money. Not Cassie\u2019s. And you can do with it as you see fit. Don\u2019t let your wife convince you to allow this enabling behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Cassie isn\u2019t upset because she knows she lied to you and doesn\u2019t know any better. She knew exactly what she was doing and kept the facade going for 2 years and is only upset that you found out. She probably hoped she could string you along until she came up with a valid reason why you\u2019d need to keep paying for her lifestyle under the assumption that you trusted that she was telling the truth", "she sounds like she'd be a terrible accountant", "NTA she literally stole from her own father. She had to know youd find out eventually, and she just didn\u2019t care about betraying you.", "NTA- She spent a lot of the money that you budgeted for her college. If you would like to give her the rest of the money once she has started school, that would be good. For example, if she took two years worth of money and wasted it, she has to take out student loans for the first two years and you can pay after that.", "She made you look like an asshole, but you are NTA. I wouldn't even offer to pay at all. I'm also not a father and all the emotions that come with that.", "Fuck around, find out", "Lmao. You\u2019re not being harsh. She fucked around and found out. \n\nNTA.", "NTA she also needs to repay you everything after she dropped out.\n\nShe can take out loans like most of us mere mortals", "NTA\n\nMom is delusional if she thinks Cassie made a mistake for nearly 2 years. Initially it was a mistake for Cassie to not tell you that she dropped out. But after the first couple of weeks Cassie made a conscious choice to steal money from you. \n\nCassie managed to figure out how to live a non college life( living space, utilities, food, etc) for 18ish months off what was essentially 3 semesters of your college funding. That is not a mistake. That is some seriously sly budgeting that she planned and executed. Not only did she survive off your money she lived and thrived to the point she got a new(assumed) better apartment while still stealing your money. Doesn't sound like the actions of someone whose immature, mistaken, or whose frontal lobe isn't developed as some other comments have stated.\n\nActions have consequences.  I am thinking you and your wife spent time as Cassie was growing up teaching her about life lessons on telling the truth, stealing, hitting, speaking kind words, etc. And punished her accordingly for rules she broke. Cassie needs to learn this lesson as well as she will need it to become the adult she is fully capable of. \n\nPerhaps she should finance her own education for the next 3 semesters and then you can sit down and decide if you are willing to help her complete her education.  And her financing the next 3 semesters could include getting grants and scholarships she wouldn't even have to pay back. Getting loans isn't her only option to pay for school.", "Where is college tuition a monthly expense rather than by semester?", "The most important lesson she needs to learn right now is you shouldn't lie and cheat your way through life.\n\nBetter *for her* that she demonstrates she learned this before you give more money.", "NTA You\u2019re teaching her an important lesson. You said you may pay for her college once she shows commitment. I think that would be the right thing to do. In the meantime, she should take out student loans, or better yet, let her get a job and save her own tuition.\n\nI paid my way through college, and believe me, I made sure my tuition dollars didn\u2019t go to waste!", "She didn't know any better? At 20??? Pft. \n\nYou're not ruining her education. She can take out a student loan, like so many others, and work to pay it off. She was blessed with having her schooling paid for and she lied to you and stole from you. Wouldn't it technically be fraud? \n\nAnd she was taking accounting lmao Definitely lacking the ethics I'd want in an accountant. Maybe someone should point out if she does that with a client's money, she's getting sued or charged. \n\nTime for your 20 year old to learn consequences. \n\nLet her pay for her own way, and PAY YOU BACK. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  She basically stole from you, this wasn't an accident, and saying she didn't know better is ***STILL CONTINUING TO LIE***.  She concocted a story to manipulate you out of money and continues to manipulate you and your wife even now.   \n\nI worked my way through college and took out loans starting mid way through my freshman year because while there had ostensibly been a plan and funds to pay for my education, my parents split during my freshman year and my dad was blowing what they had on drugs.  I had college debt for many years but I also graduated with highest honors in my major, got an early start in my career by finding a paid internship a year later that actually aligned with my goals, which became a multi-year thing, and got into a top tier graduate/professional school when the time came.  Long story short - having had to do it without help did not stop me.  It didn't even stop me from partying pretty hard during school - just gave me a sense early on of the value and importance of what I was doing and helped me to stay focused on my goals.\n\nHaving to provide for her own college is absolutely not the end of the world for Cassie, far from it.  She needs to learn that actions like this have real consequences, and even aside from teaching her a lesson, it's also totally OK for you to feel, and act on, having been fundamentally deeply betrayed and not wanting to reward her theft by just turning the spigot back on.  Absolutely, positively NTA.", "NTA. This wasn\u2019t a one-time mistake or lapse in judgement. She kept this up for a year and a half!! That\u2019s a calculated choice. And she didn\u2019t even come forward with what she did, she got caught! I assume during this time she was keeping up a web of lies about how finals were going, what classes she was taking, etc. \n\nIf you just pick the bill back up then she has suffered nothing more than some temporary social unpleasantness. I don\u2019t know how much college is where you live, but for my area this deception would translate to tens of thousands of dollars stolen. Absolutely not. If it were me I would say she could pay her own way and be grateful she\u2019s not facing criminal charges. \n\nAs a parent of young children my husband and I are sacrificing a lot to save for our kids\u2019 college funds. We are doing what we can to give them an opportunity to get a good start in life debt-free. If my kid turned around and squandered those years of sacrifice on nonsense and lied to my face for over a year in the process? You better believe I wouldn\u2019t make that mistake twice.", "NTA  This isn't a 7th grader forgetting to do their homework and lying about it...", "NTA she knew better for two years and she probably would have kept going. That's really messed up and no now she needs to go work and pay for her own schooling. At most once she proves herself then help.", "Cassie is psychotic and no intentions of returning to school. What you want to do is wise, because if she could do this, she could worse things to other people because she keeps getting away with stuff. Don\u2019t let her get away with this. The reason why I call Cassie psychotic because no normal person in their right mind would lie to their parents like this, steal money from them through deception, lacks empathy and accountability, and when she\u2019s found out lies again to continue living her lifestyle. Clearly her mother has enabled Cassie through out her entire life. This behavior is not ok. Don\u2019t pay for Cassie\u2019s life anymore and let her go find a job and work. So she can appreciate money and life better and will go back to school to get a better life.\n\nComplete NTA", "NTA. Sheesh. She took thousands of dollars from you that was given as a very generous gift. Having college paid for is a privilege and she will do just fine on student loans.", "NTA. But I\u2019d like to suggest you revisit this in a few years if she demonstrates a true turn around", "If I'm not mistaken I read this exact story here sometime last year.", "NTA. It\u2019s a harsh thing to do BUT she lied to you. On such a big scale. And she\u2019s an adult. Cassie is now going to have to accept the consequences of her actions. It was hardly an innocent little mistake", "NTA. I did something similar when I was in college and my dad also cut me off. I resented him for it for a long time, but now I understand why he did.\n\nThat said, I think you should consider setting up some condition through which you would begin paying for her school again so she can go back. She may have really learned her lesson, and if there's a way you can help prevent her from getting buried in student loan debt you really should. Maybe some way she can prove to you she's ready to go back and take it seriously - maybe she funds a semester or two herself. I don't know, something like that. I think it would have made a big difference in my educational/financial life and in my relationship with my dad if I hadn't been cut off so completely.", "NTA good on you for showing her there are consequences to her actions. You even agreed to potentially pick up payments in the future if she shows she is truly committed to going back and follows through on that commitment. She stole money from you and betrayed your trust. That cannot be allowed to go unchecked", "Don\u2019t let them redirect her actions onto you. You are not ruining her education. She is ruining her education.", "First, I don't think you're in the wrong, so NTA.\nBut I do think something more is going on with your daughter. \n\nI am 27, so I'm not too much older than her, and it was really hard being her age in college. Usually, the first thing you try isn't what you wanna do, and that does leave you with some feeling of being a bit lost and disappointed. Bc you're like \"well..now what do I do...???\" And you cope in bad ways. \n\nAlso intro to accounting is usually one of the most failed / dropped / withdrawed from classes (alongside general chemistry) bc it's really hard. So maybe she just wasn't prepared for that brain fuck. \n\nIt's obvious you want her to succeed and you care about her, which is why you were paying for her college in the first place. \n\nYou can help her in other ways tho, maybe she needs to talk to someone (college is hard and therapy helps with it tbh. Like forreal). Maybe help her by suggesting she try those programs that help people try different things to find their interests. Or maybe she can go to community college to do her gen eds, and then move to a different school. \n\nAnd if she sticks to it, and does well academically, then maybe you can pay for her school again. \n\nBut for now, student loans are there, and she can get a job too. She needs to learn that college isn't cheap and wasting money and time on it when you're not serious is a huge mistake.", "NTA- your wife is wrong. She did not make a mistake, she made a CHOICE. She is grown enough to know better. She is just mad that she doesn't have free money anymore. I would cut my child off of a college fund as well.", "I would think it\u2019s time to move back home, get into Community College to get those basic courses down (did she even pass anything that first semester???) and have her get a job to pay for it all, including any student loans.\n\nWhen she proves she can pass you can see about helping out the last two years. Until she can show that she wants to go to school, she gets no help from you aside the free room and board.\n\nLiving the life on your dime is over!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut maybe make a deal where you pay the college directly?", "NTA. She knew what she was doing. She needs to face the consequences or she will never learn.", "NTA, she's basically stolen from you, until she pays that back, don't give her any more money. What you do now is education. Do you want to teach her to be responsible for her own actions, or that thieving and scamming pays off?", "NTA \n\nYour daughter \"made a mistake\"\n\nI hate it when people conflate deceit with mistakes.", "So for years she has not only been taking your money and lying about being enrolled, but probably has also been giving elaborate stories about how school and classes are going? How hard she's been working, how annoying that teacher is, how much homework and studying she has...\n\n...and your wife and family think you should just continue to fund this liar?? \n\nTell them that you have supplied her with 2 years schooling, and expenses. She should go get those 2 years of schooling completed on her own and then come back, grovel and beg forgiveness, and then maybe you'll *discuss the possibility* of paying for school again. But never cash in hand (or direct deposit to her) again. \n\nNTA. Your family is not realizing just how long this con has gone on, how much she has used and abused you and your aid, your generosity and love. Shame on her and shame on them. I hope your wife comes around and agrees with you.", "NTA\n\nshe's sorry she got caught.", "And I guarantee if she does end up going back and taking out loans, she\u2019ll have a great GPA and graduate with a good job because she\u2019s seen what fucking up looks like and not want to go down that path again.", "^this!!! Definitely NTA. Her putting in the effort of paying her own way for the same amount of time her parents did would really show her commitment to college. If OP pays her way it basically excuses her deceit. Trust is earned and she now needs to demonstrate that she can be trusted.", "I think this is a reasonable and measured approach.  I wouldn\u2019t blame OP for not paying another dime.  But this ensures she has skin in the game.", "Look up Jennifer Pan. Casual Criminalist just did an episode on her thing there is tubs else out there as well. She ran with this same lie for like 7 years, \u201cundergrad\u201d plus \u201cmed school\u201d before getting found out. It did not end well fire anyone.", ">\tShe didn\u2019t know that lying and misappropriating your money was wrong? \n\nShe should be treated as if this were true, meaning she\u2019s too stupid for college.", "And the worst part is she absolutely would\u2019ve continued to lie and take your money had she not been exposed.", "Love this comment! Completely agree. Accountability and boundaries need to be set.", "Yes I'd definitely be willing to pay off some of the loans if she can prove to me she's going to be on the right track, and that I can trust her again", "Immature? She lied to him and stole his money (yes this is stealing) for almost two years. He only found out because her friend slipped, she had no intention of telling him. That doesn't sound like someone immature, that sounds like someone that was clever to cover their tracks and know exactly what they're doing.\n\nHe's not letting her derail, he's telling her she can get loans and work like majority of the population do, show him that she's willing to put in the effort and regain his trust, and then he would consider paying. If she doesn't want to do that and is just waiting for daddy's money again, then it's obvious she still hasn't learnt anything and just wants the cash to fund her lifestyle.", "Lmao? She lied and stole for 2 years. How is that a fair compromise? Her sister wasn't a thief, no comparison. She has absolutely no right to be \"resentful\".", "Yep I can see what you're saying. IMO the OP is not being reasonable. Also the fact that OP says his older daughter was also given money for college and she was fine, sounds like he probably brought it up with Cassie too \"Look how well your sister did and you're just nothing!\". What she did is wrong, yes. What OP is doing is also wrong.", "NTA. Cassie can still go to college on her own dime, she blew through YEARS of what could\u2019ve been working towards her degree", "She\u2019s an adult now. She lied to her dad & took advantage . It wasn\u2019t a mistake that she dropped out & continued to use the funds given in good faith for living the way she wanted to. If she wants to go back, she can take out loans. I have a feeling she\u2019s just saying so sorry now, to receive the money. She\u2019s facing the consequences of her actions.", "She can take out loans. She can get a job. There are many many ways to get through school without using a dime of parents money, as hundreds of thousands of students do. What OP said is perfect, if she can show she truly cares and works hard, then he would consider paying in the future. Trust is easy to lose and hard to regain - what Cassie did isn't a simple \"mistake\", it's full on lying and stealing. \n\nWhat she can do now to get his trust back is start acting like the adult she is, show that she can make good decisions instead of stealing money to move to fancy apartments and buy Chanel bags.", "Oh, great. Blaming the victim.\n\nHe trusted his daughter and she abused that trust.", "This is such a shit take. He is giving her a second chance. He didn't disown her and tell her to get out of his life. He said if she wants to go back to school on her own, she can do so and if she shows him she actually cares this time, he'll consider supporting her again.\n\nAnd while I do agree that he shouldn't have given the money to her directly, he says he did the same with his other daughter and she graduated just fine. So clearly she could resist the temptation to steal. I would assume most people can resist the temptation to steal. Clearly he trusted his kids a lot and supported them, and this is a massive blow to that.", "This has merit.  Be her parent.  Guide her on the right path.  She has abused your trust and must mend that.  You can pay invoices issued by the school, but she must put you on her student account so you can see her grades.  She needs to get a pt job to begin repayment.  Trust but verify.", "Agreed.  If she pays back what she stole in the form of paying for her own schooling for two years, then contributing the last two years would be a nice thing to do.  It\u2019d also be a teaching moment", "Yeah, shows that she understands what OP gave up to support her over this period right?", "This happened near where I used to live. It was huge and stunned everyone in our community.", "Exactly! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be paying for my kids\u2019 college, but I do know it\u2019ll be fair around the board. Otherwise, worse things will come from it all together.", "Yup, and she would've kept abusing dad's money for her lifestyle if she hadn't of got caught.  \nShe can work part time and go to college part time on her own dime.", "I was stunned over the internet with years of distance. It was just so duplicitous and shocking."]}
