Cassie\u2019s excuse she didn\u2019t know better is ridiculous.  She lied about visitors to hide her deception and has in effect been stealing from you since she dropped out.  \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right, many, if not most kids, work and take out loans to pay for college.  Cassie had the golden goose and made the conscious decision to choose deceit over her education.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry your wife isn\u2019t on board with this tough life lesson and wish you luck staying firm with your decision.  Hopefully a good dose of reality will help Cassie learn to take responsibility for her actions.", "NTA \n\nThat was a major lie. I wouldn't trust her. How would you verify if she's going to classes if you did pay for it again? She's ok being deceptive. Nah, do not pay for her again.", "NTA.  She can prove to you that she\u2019s serious about school by paying for two years of community college herself.  At that point, perhaps she\u2019s earned a second chance.

You were paying for her to go to college, not to do nothing. What did she think was going to happen after her time at \"college\" ended? She is reaping the rewards for her own terrible decision making.", "NTA. I have a family member that is doing something similar. It\u2019s over a decade later since this family member first went to college, and he still plays the same games with the parents. They fund the bill, and he continues to take their money on a ride. It doesn\u2019t matter what logic you present to the parents, they didn\u2019t set boundaries early on, and now they feel obligated to \u201csee this through.\u201d The parents don\u2019t see that they are actually enabling this behavior, and they can\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t pull it together. Their son is in his 30\u2019s, no job, no degree, no work ethic, and going to school part-time while he plays video games all day and doesn\u2019t have to pay for a single bill. At the moment, it\u2019s a pretty good deal for him..so I think if I were him, I wouldn\u2019t have the motivation to change anything, either. They\u2019ve made it too easy for him after he initially messed up 10+ years ago.\n\n\nYou\u2019re in the right on this. If she wants it bad enough, she\u2019ll find a way.

If she wants to go to school, she can pay her own way now. People don\u2019t get to walk all over and betray the trust of others without making amends and demonstrating that they are deserving of trust again. Respectfully, you would be silly if you started paying the school directly right now because she SUDDENLY decided that that she *does* want to go to school after misappropriating the money you were giving her for school for two years. She can go to a community college and complete her gen ed credits on her own dime, then transfer back to her traditional 4-year university and complete her degree- at which point you can help her financially if you deem it appropriate.", "NTA. She didn't, as a full grown adult, just suddenly learn the difference between right and wrong. She is just learning, perhaps, the consequences of a bad choice between them, which in this case will not ruin her life. She can, as you properly made clear, take out a loan.", "Nta actions have consequences and I call bull to her not knowing better. My 9 year old niece knows lying by omission is still lying. And if she didn't know it was wrong why lie about the halls? Good on you giving her a chance to prove she's learnt something.", "NTA. If Cassie really wants to go back to school, she can take student loans to enroll in a community college for a certificate or to get her gen eds. If shes able to complete a program there, you can revisit helping her transferring to get a BA.", "nta\n\nshe abused your trust and she knew this was wrong and made lies to collaborate the story.", "NTA. She is on her own. You funded her bullshit lifestyle and now she is learning her lesson. Fafo.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re being generous and willing to potentially give her a second chance down the road. \n\nThat was a pretty egregious lie. \n\nTrust is a two way street and you have to earn it. She unfortunately has not met that standard.  \n\nAs a parent I feel like one of the biggest lessons we can teach our children is not squander opportunity.", "NTA.  She took money for nearly 2 years and didn't use it for it's intended purpose.  In most scenarios this is a crime.  She abused your trust, now the responsibility to pay for her lifestyle is on her, if she wants to go to college then she can pay.  If your wife thinks that her doing this for nearly 2 years is a mistake then maybe she can get a job/second job and fund your daughters college, as long as she still contributes what she currently is to the household.  This was not a mistake.  What did your daughter think was going to happen after college was supposed to finish and she had no degree.", "NTA. She lied and disrespected you by lying. This is your hard earned money meant to give her a better future not drop and have extravagant stuff. Punishment fits the crime in my opinion. I would suggest she pays on her own for the time period she missed and has to catch up, afterwards continue paying, but directly to the school. Or if she doesnt want to do college that is fine, she can get a job and pay her way and have the extravagant lifestyle.\nYou use the money on something else\ud83d\ude09", "NTA\n\nI know its your daughter, but, exchange her place with anyone in the world and what would you do?  \n\nYour dilemma, \n\n* Dont help with college and take yourself out of the equation but leave her future in her hands\n* Continue to fully fund and she really hasnt been punished or learned accountability\n* Help and be able to monitor her progress but appear as if you are the oppressor\n* Make her pay next semester (or two) to incur hardship, give the appearance of \"paying you back\" and give her some visual of the strain you go through for her.  Set parameters with this and goals to be achieved", "NTA she was more than old enough to realize her many actions would have consequences. She had to know you guys would be finding out someday. She is just upset because she got caught before figuring a way to tell you both. She consciously lied and continued to lie and not a small white lie either. She is an adult making adult decisions, she should be treated like one now too. Yes you don\u2019t want to hinder her education and bad judgment or choices do happen, but I think letting her take out her own loans and let that trust build back up before dishing out more financial assistance is what she needs. She is not a child anymore and needs to see what it\u2019s like in the real world when there is not someone you can always fall back on or expect someone to pay your way. She will always know she is loved even with boundaries.", "NTA. Your wife needs to have your back. If this hadn't come to light, when would Cassie have spilled the beans? How long would she have kept the wool over your eyes? She can't be trusted, until she earns back your trust.", "NTA. She wants to study accounting and if she wants to get her professional qualification, the professional bodies have mandatory modules on ethics and integrity. She should learn how to walk the talk.", "I was so ready to say YTA after the title but after reading, deffo NTA. You\u2019re right and seems like you are invested in how she turns out as a person.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it was a stupid move to give Cassie the money direct. You were treating her like the adult she is and allowing her to take responsibility for her future. She betrayed that trust by stealing from you for 2 years and then claimed she didn\u2019t know any better!!\n\nHas she even apologised for what she\u2019s done? I would suggest at a bare minimum she needs to get a job and start paying back all the money she stole. Maybe once she\u2019s paid you back you can revisit her education options but as it stands you have no obligation to fund anything.", "NTA. It's a betrayal of your trust and sacrifice. She is an adult so she should realise the consequences. And honestly, with such a deception, I don't think accountancy is a suitable career path for her.", "NTA, she straight up lied and used you.\nAlso I\u2019d have a serious talk with your wife, seems like she knew about all this to me", "Young ppl are dumb, their brains are developing, they make poor choices. It took me way longer than it should have to mature and realize right from wrong. I only say that because there are a lot of saints here in these comments.\n\nNTA. Trust has to be rebuilt, she doesn\u2019t get to steal and experience no consequences, and you\u2019re absolutely right she should take out loans and show she\u2019s serious. But if she does, I would resume paying. Or help with loans afterward, or with a masters or something. I don\u2019t think people realize how crippling debt from education can be. If you can help after she shows maturity I hope you do", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s 20, and it sounds like she weaved a little web of lies to keep this going for over a year.

She\u2019s just upset she got caught.", "there are plenty of part time evening accounting college courses - some that do not take very long to get a certificate - payroll etc.\n\nShe can get an entry level job in an office doing AP or AR and take night classes.

So they went on thinking she was in school, she went on cashing the checks...\n\nUntil it all fell apart.", "What's your endgame on this? What if it's that Cassie never goes to college? Is that the victory you're after?", "NTA but I wonder why you think your wife doesn't get a say in the matter. Do you keep your money separate and were you the only one paying for the college?", "I'm undecided between NTA and ESH. \n\nYou can't do something like that if your wife (if she's Cassie's mother) isn't on board. This is not a decision you can just make alone.\n\nAnd just one thing to consider: your daughter is extremely bad with money (and seems quite immature), do you think that she'll manage to get an education now, without your money when she didn't manage before, when you were helping her?\n\nI think it would be a good idea to make a specific plan now. What does she have to do now to get your trust back? And what will she do about her future?\nThis is something you and your family should discuss and set clear goals (I'm not saying you absolutely have to pay for college again, there's a lot of ways to help her out.)", "NTA, but have a conversation with your wife about it. Maybe you guys can set aside the money to pay off or pay down the loans as soon as Cassie graduates, if you two can agree that's the right path forward - but this time around, the risk should be on her.", "ESH\n\nWhat Cassie did is wrong, definitely agree. But people fuck up and deserve second chances. You're not a random stranger. You're her dad. If she can't lean on you for support, then who will she go to?\n\nAn extremely dumb move on your part to hand the money directly to her. Not saying what she did is right but seriously, how many people would be able to resist that temptation? Your wife is correct, you can pay directly to the school from now so you know Cassie can't use it for anything else. Maybe she was struggling in her classes and felt she didn't have any other option so she hid it from you, so get her help if she needs it too.", "Each child is a different experience. Technically you did all the right things and I get you are disappointed but you have to understand children will disappoint you. Your child was probably overwhelmed after the first semester panicked and found an unhealthy coping mechanism. Any person with fully developed brain would\u2019ve known this arrangement wasn\u2019t gonna end well but she is a child yes young adult but still very young. We all learn through mistakes we make. You are right she broke your trust but your wife is also right. She can try again and you can directly pay the school. Give a try again see if this was the wake up call needed. You need to cope with your disappointment and put your child\u2019s future ahead of your emotions. Many people looking at it mechanically will agree with your approach but I\u2019m telling you as the kid who fucked up and thanks to my dad punishing me a different way then by putting me in a different school and I became an honors student, moved to America had a very successful career.

If you would like to give her the rest of the money once she has started school, that would be good. For example, if she took two years worth of money and wasted it, she has to take out student loans for the first two years and you can pay after that.", "She made you look like an asshole, but you are NTA.

I am thinking you and your wife spent time as Cassie was growing up teaching her about life lessons on telling the truth, stealing, hitting, speaking kind words, etc. And punished her accordingly for rules she broke. Cassie needs to learn this lesson as well as she will need it to become the adult she is fully capable of. \n\nPerhaps she should finance her own education for the next 3 semesters and then you can sit down and decide if you are willing to help her complete her education.

She concocted a story to manipulate you out of money and continues to manipulate you and your wife even now.   \n\nI worked my way through college and took out loans starting mid way through my freshman year because while there had ostensibly been a plan and funds to pay for my education, my parents split during my freshman year and my dad was blowing what they had on drugs.  I had college debt for many years but I also graduated with highest honors in my major, got an early start in my career by finding a paid internship a year later that actually aligned with my goals, which became a multi-year thing, and got into a top tier graduate/professional school when the time came.  Long story short - having had to do it without help did not stop me.  It didn't even stop me from partying pretty hard during school - just gave me a sense early on of the value and importance of what I was doing and helped me to stay focused on my goals.\n\nHaving to provide for her own college is absolutely not the end of the world for Cassie, far from it.  She needs to learn that actions like this have real consequences, and even aside from teaching her a lesson, it's also totally OK for you to feel, and act on, having been fundamentally deeply betrayed and not wanting to reward her theft by just turning the spigot back on.

Clearly her mother has enabled Cassie through out her entire life. This behavior is not ok. Don\u2019t pay for Cassie\u2019s life anymore and let her go find a job and work. So she can appreciate money and life better and will go back to school to get a better life.\n\nComplete NTA", "NTA. Sheesh.

Maybe some way she can prove to you she's ready to go back and take it seriously - maybe she funds a semester or two herself. I don't know, something like that.

Her life, her decision. If she can swing some funding for education elsewhere, good for her; I'll count that towards being \"paid back\" as long as it's not a handout from some other relative.

Maybe you pay 50% of her tuition directly to the school and she has to come up with the rest. That would still help her learn to be responsible with money. Or you could offer to pay only for community college courses.

There are so many different degrees out there, and most unis also have a study abroad option for part of or all of second year too which she could apply for. Let her look at all of her options and then offer the deal. As doing an obscure to many topic could lead to her doing a L7 postgraduate degree e.g pgce and going into teaching at schools or f.e colleges\n\n Offer the deal with conditions obviously.

As if you don't even offer that deal, it could end up being a permanent issue between you. Yes, she f'd up by not being honest with you for 2 years, and that deceit and deception will continue to hurt you for a long time.
