Me and him don\u2019t get along for a multitude of reasons. When he was younger, he stole money from my room and lit my makeup brushes on fire in the bathroom sink. For his punishment, he wasn\u2019t allowed to come over for that weekend he was supposed to visit, and my dad allowed me to buy a lock to put on my door. That was his only punishment for destroying my things after I had been nothing but nice to him, even giving him money so he wouldn\u2019t steal mine. \n\nHe\u2019s coming down this year, and my dad and stepmom were planning on hiding it from me until Christmas Eve when I went over and would see him there. Well, there plans got foiled by my younger brother, and now I don\u2019t want to go to the Christmas party and plan on locking myself in my room when they come over to my Grandmas on Christmas. I didn\u2019t feel bad about it, but my brother says I\u2019m being over dramatic by not celebrating so now I\u2019m second guessing myself. AITA?\n\nETA: I was 16 and he was 11 when this happened. I understand that happened 6 years ago, but he faced no consequences, didn\u2019t show remorse, and my parents didn\u2019t hold him responsible. On top of that, I\u2019ve seen him maybe twice since then and locked myself in my room every time.
