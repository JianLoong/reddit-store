New employees are given a pass for so long but eventually you have to be able to pull your own weight. Debbie can't but you've been pulling her weight for so long that she is probably freaking out.\n\nI would tell her the truth. You are not her baby sitter, she gets paid more than she deserves for the work she does already and she is a grown ass adult so if she can't get her own new job it is not your responsibility to find her a job.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude02 No wonder new people don't like me at work.

I\u2019m a petty person, so I\u2019d tell Debbie I\u2019ll speak with management at the new job re: a position for her. Then go tell your mew manager ALL about Debbie lol. They would likely appreciate it", "NTA Debbie is displaying narcissistic traits which is why she is trying so desperately to contact you. You are responsible for your own happiness so you should keep ignoring her and be relieved you will soon have her out of your life.", "Ok, so if you died, the company would hire someone in your place. It's because your replaceable at work.  We all are.. she just wants life to be easy and knows when your gone they will see her faults.  So leave without guilt. Enjoy life", "NTA - block her everywhere and stop feeling bad about it, you\u2019re probably the only reason she has this job, and it\u2019s not your problem anymore. Do not help her get another job, you\u2019ll ruin your reputation for no good reason. Good luck on your future projects", "NTA\ndon\u2019t feel bad at all, debbie can\u2019t do her job especially even when she was getting mini lessons from you. she basically just gave you another workload to worry about, yeah the team will not function but  maybe it\u2019s time for debbie to finally learn her job.", "NTA Do not respond - this is harassment. It's not your job to be on call for her outside of work.", "NTA at all. Debbie sounds horrible. Keep those boundaries up and good luck on your new job. If you really feel the need to keep things smooth you could say things like \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re hiring anyone else right now but if I hear about anything I\u2019ll let you know\u201d and then never talk to her again.", "NTA", "NTA, but please, actually contact HR now that you are no longer in a position where you can experience retaliation from debbie, tell HR what's going on.", "NTA and if you have sick leave, I'd take it. If not, and if you can afford not to work for those weeks, I would go to HR and simply say that you are being harassed and are not comfortable staying on any longer. That your coworker is calling you off the clock to do her work and that she is demanding that you help her find a new job and she's been using you to do her work for quite a while and you're done.", "Perhaps you could help her find a job far far away from your location. NTA", "NTA. But you should have dealt with that through HR or talking to a manager or someone who managed you all. Block her and don't interact with her anymore.", "NTA.  You owe this woman nothing, and just based on what you wrote, she\u2019s one of the main reasons you\u2019re leaving.  Block her on your personal phone and go MC with her the day you leave.  Good luck in your new job!", "Nta. Drop the rope. You're just pulling yourself down. She is the catalyst of your stress. It sucks for the rest of the team, yes, but you can only look out for yourself. \n\nAnd think about how you are going to tell HR the truth about her work. If only for the future of the people on the team that you do like.", "NTA, but it's sad you felt like you had to leave your job to get away from Debbie instead of going to your manager / owner / HR or whatever and set the record straight.\n\nFor info, any reason you felt like you could not do that? Is Debbie related to someone important there?", "NTA. And DON\u2019T TELL HER WHERE YOU WILL BE WORKING. What if she follows you and continues this madness? Agh I can\u2019t stand lazy mooch coworkers.", "That exit interview should be pretty juicy.", "Seriously, OP owes Debbie nothing, if she wants to be thoughtful to someone at work, as regards her leaving, she should be thoughtful to everyone BUT Debbie, and make a list of everything OP can think of that Debbie did wrong (possibly a list of deleted emails...) and send it to HR/their boss, whomever can get Debbie written up.", "Deleting client emails is crazy.  That's going to end up costing the company money.", "At this point, I wouldn\u2019t wait for an exit interview.  I don\u2019t even know if companies do them anymore.  I would walk into HR in the morning and let them know exactly why you are leaving and how stressed you are due to Debbie.  Then let HR know what she is doing.  Especially deleting the emails.  That could harm the company.", "I definitely need to work on that. I don't like confrontation. I've been trying to explain things to Debbie nicely and have snapped a couple of times but nothing seems to get through to her.", "I love your response tbh because if you are sweet they will take advantage of you.", "I think she's taking advantage of me too. I just want to leave immediately. It's causing me so much stress and my mental health has been at its worst.", "It doesn't get through because she's willfully ignoring you. She doesn't want to hear you because if she does, you'll stop doing what she wants. She recognizes that you're too nice to speak up and is manipulating you.", "I think she\u2019s a lost cause \u2014 the people who need to take action are her boss and the company. Let them know that you\u2019ve been helping her do her work because she\u2019s not capable despite extensive coaching. And let them take it from there. \n\nPs: block her phone number", "would you be able to go NC/block her now? if not, do so as soon as you can because she will continue to hound you and if she finds out where you\u2019ve went, no doubt she will apply for a position . I had a co-worker/friend like that. We hung out outside of work (both nurses) & after she was fired, she was continually going from job to job. She always claimed she was always being bullied but the truth was, she was the bully & was also stealing drugs. Addiction doesn\u2019t necessarily make a person bad but even sober she would use  & manipulate people.  She was able to keep her license but the last straw for me was when she fabricated my job position on a resume. I always gave her a great reference (even though she kept getting fired but I knew she had kids to support).  instead of listing me as a co-worker, she put me down as a manager & I could have lost my license for falsifying my position. When I refused to do it, she went off on me and I told her I was finished being used by her. You\u2019ve got to make a clean break from her because she will continue to suck the life out of you. Congrats on you new job & new journey - you deserve it!", "BLOCK HER the day you leave!!  NTA OP", "I feel like in that last two weeks you should show how Debbie is taking advantage of you. Not doing anything she wants and they will see who is really needed at that work place before you go.", "Wtf why are you acting like a doormat? Text her that she's incompetent, to not bother you again and that she's deluded to think you'd help her with finding a job ever again. You'd be doing her a favor and maybe she will change her ways."]}
