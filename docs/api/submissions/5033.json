She doesn\u2019t deserve her promotion", "NTA.  Block her on your phone.  She's trying to use you to get another job.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to stop worrying about Debbie. Seriously. She is harassing you. Stop avoiding her, establish a boundary and be honest with this person who bears some (if not all) responsibility in how toxic your current job has become for you. Tell her under no circumstances would you get her a job at your new employer, that she is a big part of why you are leaving your current job, you don't want to work with her again  and you are not responsible for whatever hardship she believes your leaving this toxic workplace will cause you. Her hardship is her own fault because she can't/won't step up and do her job. Tell her to stop calling and texting your personal phone and then tell HR what is happening to ensure the harassment stops.\n\n  \nThis is the perfect opportunity for you to learn how not to be a doormat and let people take advantage of and abuse you in the workplace. Trust me when I tell you that learning how to do this may be difficult at first but will become easier the more you do it and will be one of the best things you can do for yourself.", "NTA and honestly you should just stop working now. 2 weeks notice is a courtesy but you already have a new job and owe them nothing. Take some time to rest.", "NTA", "NTA do yourself a favor and block her number, her incompetence is no longer your problem", "Eh, I'd say OP should stay out of it and keep her exit clean. It doesn't benefit OP in the slightest for her to clue in HR, and could actually negatively affect future references if they end up blaming OP somehow. OP's boss should have been managing effectively and if they had been, they would have realized OP was doing all the work and that Debbie is a poor employee.\n\nYour soon-to-be old company will find out what's what after you've made your exit, OP - it's really not your problem anymore!", "If you've already handed in your resignation, and you know you're going to be harrassed by Debbie and that HR won't help, just call in sick for the next two weeks. What are they going to do? Fire you? \n\nI wouldn't even worry about a reference from this company because it sounds like it's going under, and so many companies are only allowed to confirm that you worked there, and not give any evaluation of what you were like as an employee. \n\nYou've already worked loads of overtime for that company. Think of leaving before the two weeks are up as time they owe you.", "Don\u2019t help her with a new position. Your referral would help her. But it would hurt you. Once they figured out she is a poor performer. You\u2019ll lose credibility with them.\n\nIf she figures out were you work. Then tries to use your name or you as a reference. Just say I can\u2019t give her a referral. When they ask you about her. You don\u2019t say anything bad, just refuse the referral. They\u2019ll read between the lines.", "Do you have to stay, like per a contract? Or is it at will, and you don't need to give notice?", "OP, you sound like a good and considerate person but please take the time to be good and considerate to yourself first! Debbie sounds insufferable: first you help her to get a promotion, then she decides to abandon you and the team in search of a new job while dumping a lot on you, and finally when you decide to leave as well, she has the nerve to blame you for her workload. This doesn't sound like a trustworthy person who deserves help regarding a new position / new company.", "There are companies that do take advantage of good employees as they always seem to be the ones that sacrifice to get the job done. People like Debbie are responsible for companies losing good employees. \n\nA high turnover rate indicates that a company at its core is problematic.\n\nGood luck in your new job.", "Screenshot all those texts and forward them to HR. If you have voicemails send those as well.", "Debbie is clearly a user. Ghosting her doesn't seem to be working, so I think you need to try the bluntly honest approach. Try something like this:\n\nIf I helped you get a new job, it would reflect poorly on me and my judgment. I learned that lesson when I helped you get the promotion. \n\nThen block her on your phone and social media.", "She\u2019s going to get herself fired, you don\u2019t have to say a thing. Block her number and move on. Our next workplace will appreciate you.", "Just because an email domain is legit doesn't mean those weren't spam or phishing emails. Not enough info on this point to make judgement but overall you're NTA.", "Then talk to your manager or email your manager.\n\n If you have any personal/vacation/sick days left make sure you are going to get them paid out.  It sounds like you are leaving a sinking ship.", "It probably won't improve until you're honest and tell him that he's a big part of the reason you're leaving"]}
