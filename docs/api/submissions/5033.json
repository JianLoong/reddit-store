Tell her to back off or just block her number.", "Why were you helping her at all?", "You no longer work there.\n\nNTA.  \n\n\n\\*Edit - I read this wrong, but still not the asshole. Block her on your personal phone because she has no reason to call you after work hours, you're clearly not friends. Save everything, and just do your work, no more no less, and you'll be fine.", "Nta", "I was at a job that had a lot of turn over for many reasons. I put in the work and extra work over others and was laid off before them. It honestly was a blessing because I didn\u2019t realize just how much I was burnt out/taken advantage of. For a bit after a few of my former co-workers would text me to ask questions or input about things I had been working on. I answered the first couple but after that I stopped because it\u2019s there job not mine anymore. Stop answering and just get through your last days as quietly as possible.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSend an email to HR with screenshots of all the texts and things she's sent you because it's straight up harassment.\n\nAlso cc yourself into the email so you have a record of it", "As Eminem says fu Debbie!!", "Sounds like a toxic workplace, but you\u2019re NTA for looking after your physical and mental health by leaving. Debbie doesn\u2019t sound like a good coworker & you aren\u2019t obligated to drag her along like a tin can tied to a dog\u2019s tail.", "Don't bother HR. When you do they will probably turn it to be you allowed this by helping her all the time and painting that to your co workers. Instead work with the co workers you like and get them up to speed on what you can. Then go. \n\nAs far as Debbie goes, just tell her you are closing out and passing on your projects and won't have time to help her out.\n\nAt most if something of yours is being given to her just do a quick debrief no more than 1/2 hour.", "NTA.\n\nHopefully your former employer has realized Debbie isn't so dynamic after all - just a dunce.\n\nPS - you do what is best for YOU!\n\nGood luck with the new job!", "NTA Block her. Put the past behind you and concentrate on your future, which does not include Debbie. Your past employer will manage somehow. Debbie is not your responsibility, she is an adult being paid to do a job. Let her do it.\n\nGood luck at your new job. I hope that it is a lot less stress than your last one. Don't let anyone ride your coattails.", "NTA \n\nDo not tell Debbie where you are going\n\nDo not answer Debbie\u2019s phone calls \n\nDo not get Debbie a job\n\nDo tell HR that Debbie is harassing you and deleting emails \n\nDo turn your phone off after work\n\nDo enjoy your new job", "This is bad advice. They\u2019re in the same field and it doesn\u2019t make sense to burn these professional bridges.", "We're encouraged to help each other out because the most important thing to our bosses is that deadlines are met.", "Agree 100%. Why would OP want to rehash all that? She found another job and is leaving.  She should leave no negative vibes behind being petty by pretending to help the company.", "Yes. Forget the whole exit interview thing. Just leave like everyone else who gets a new job-with optimism and a chance for a brighter future. Good luck and enjoy your new position.", "In lieu of an exit interview I figured I would do one myself. \n\nBelow are the top 10 questions to ask an employee during an exit interview, as well as my thought out response. \n\n...", "You need to report all of this to HR.\n\nThen, after that, tell Debbie that you are not interested in helping her find a new position because she has not proven herself competent in her current position and you can not be used as a reference. Tell the rest of the team that when they get sick of Debbie that you will serve as a reference for them. \n\nDrive your stake in the ground.", "Just finish your time and leave. Block what\u2019s her name and move on.", "Absolutely don\u2019t tell anyone about Debbie. You don\u2019t owe this company anything and it\u2019s no longer your problem. There\u2019s no reason to stir up anything for yourself.", "Why should OP do this? She\u2019s done enough for the business. They should already know what\u2019s been going on. If they don\u2019t\u2026 oh well. OP should make a clean break and be done with it, not spend her last days rehashing everything.", "I\u2019m in HR and I support this message", "It\u2019s not for the business, it\u2019s so that if someone else complains about Debbie, there\u2019s something on record to back up the complaint."]}
