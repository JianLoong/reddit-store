You are expected to cover for a flakey co-worker. Start looking elsewhere.", "NTA And tell them nothing other than that you need a sick day. Anything beyond that isn\u2019t their concern.", "NTA. Time to talk to HR and file a formal complaint against your boss and your coworker. And make sure to explain in detail how your coworker called you to berate you for not giving your pre approved day to her when you have been denied emergency PTO when you have a sick child. I'm sure they would be very interested to ask your boss why this has been allowed to go on for so long.", "Your manager and coworker are an AH. If my boss ever told me to have my spouse to WFH. Absolutely not, they have training, a mandatory meeting, etc. It's not his business. Also just say taking a sick day no other explanation is needed. Never give up a PTO day, you earned it. Tell your coworker to be a better parent and her teenager is not your problem. Tell your boss to be a team player and do the coworkers job. Their Emergency is not your problem. \nI am always vague of my plans, but if called I just say I have nonrefundable tickets or out of town so am 3 hours away. Sorry this was a planned PTO.  Keep your distance from that co-worker also tell HR about the phone call and you are now going to block her.", "NTA\n\nBut also, never answer your phone on your days off.", "Nta, not your problem at all, in fact, tell ypur boss to hire people who show up to work, and be sure to contact hr for harassment", "NTA. Management\u2019s responsibility to ensure adequate staffing and handle contingencies. Your boss is cutting staffing to the minimum because you are a labor expense and he wants to look good to his bosses for being efficient.", "NTA\n\nI have trained it into my supervisors that besides the head supervisor and 2 times a year when we do shift change phone calls, i will not answer my phone when not on shift.  I might answer emails or texts, if they are lucky, but that is done on my time.  Next time they call, don't answer. \n\nEven if she never took time off,  you shouldn't give your day away in favor of them.  The fact that they are abusing the system makes that even more so.", "NTA for not covering but I notice you and others being a tad ableist in the comments. It\u2019s not your responsibility to cover for your coworker, especially if you were scheduled off in advance, but you mention that your coworker has migraines in a comment and that their kid had a \u201cmild\u201d headache. I highly doubt their kid missed school for a mild headache. Migraines are hereditary\u2026 highly likely that their child gets migraines too (they\u2019re not too young either- I already was experiencing migraines at that age). Chronic migraines are a disability. Boss could get in real trouble for failing to accommodate your coworker. But that need for accommodation shouldn\u2019t fall onto you.", "YTA for asking such a ridiculous question.", "NTA had no right to call you and say anything about it.", "[removed]", "Big time!", "I feel it is Completely inappropriate for her employers to be demanding her husband take days off instead of her.  They are NOT his employer and they do not pay his salary, therefore THEY should not be interfering with his employment at all.\n\nShe needs to shut that down.", "Coworker does have a medical condition if you read the comments- migraines, and judging by the frequency, chronic migraine, which is a disability. Highly doubt the kiddo had just a \u201cmild\u201d headache- chronic migraine is hereditary.", "I'm not, but debating it. I hate that the environment is so toxic because I love the job that I do very much.", "Yes, I get 3 weeks of time accrued a year", "We have company supplied phones and they know that on my days off I turn it on vibrate or silent. What I do isn't saving lives or vital to infrastructure. They also know I fish and hike so I'm often in areas with no reception. They know to leave me a message if they need help and will gauge whether I can or want to come in. \n\nI get paid a base salary plus commission, so sometimes it's  very much worth it to come in. But I also value my recreation time, in my eyes part of the entire purpose of having a job. It helps that I do my job well, client like my work and I have decades of experience at this point in an industry that lost too many workers during the pandemic (put it this way, you almost have to try to get fired ATM. We even rehired someone who was fired just a few years ago).\n\nSo my advice is the same as others: **simply do not answer that phone.** Force them to leave a voicemail or send a text so you can judge whether it rises to level of giving up what sounds like mental health time. If it doesn't and you don't feel like you need to justify it, tell them you went for long walk/hike purposely without your phone or to see a movie in a theater with poor reception.", "Yeah husband said the \"team\" doesn't exist to me except the hours of 8-5 M-F, it's just hard for me because outside of the coworker, I love what I do so much", "I didn't report to HR because I got no follow up from my last complaint. Thought about going to CEO but I fear backlash. (My company has like 40 People so CEO is in same building as us)", "Unfortunately they absolutely would which is why I now have so many tasks I didn't use to have. They just shift it on to the existing employees and hire new.", "That's deep", "I want to try that, but am scared to at the same time. I'd say 25%of my PTO days have a phone call or text message included from someone at work. I'm not even in management or a supervisor but I still get called with questions a lot.", "Yeah it gives me the icks but I do it because I feel if I don't I will get reprimanded", "I'm only leaned in the last couple years I can \"question\" authority (even though that's not what I'd be doing). I was taught to be quiet and do my job as my boss is my boss for a reason.\n\nI'm learning how toxic that mentality really is the hard way", "Yeah, I work at a small business in a small town.", "I worry if I don't and it's something that I have to do then it'll cause more work for me after I return to the office", "I say mild because that is what M called it. I wouldn't assume that's what I were if she had not told me.", "Next time tell them that your husband's workplace has had a policy change and they have to book with days in advance now. Ideally you would just be able to say no, but prep a lie for when they push and you feel you can't get away with no being a complete sentence.", "Employers don't get it at all.\n\nI once got told that I needed to make sure my husband was taking sick days to care for our kids when they were sick because I was taking too many (I wasn't and my husband earns twice my pay and does shift work so can't just swap his sleep to care for kids). \n\nFor a time, my husband worked at that same company with me. We had a conference one day that we were both supposed to attend but kids were sick. Husband stayed home to care for them while I went to the conference. Got told that I should have been the one to stay home.\n\nYou can't win with these sorts of people.", "Is she related to someone? Or sleeping with someone?  <j/k>", "I agree and if that's what it is there should be accomodations for her. But those accomodations should not be \"well that's OP's job now\"  \n\nI know all about the accomodations that people need and that I do not need to know, byt it should not integrally change my job as well.", "Don't. You aren't being paid to do her job. \n\nEmail boss next time this happens and you get her work shoved on you, document everything. \n\n\"Hey boss, due to M's absence she is unable to participate with X or complete X and it has been put on my desk, should I prioritize the current tasks I have been given, or should I work on X first?\"\n\nPut the ball in their court. Let them know that you will not, and cannot, feasibly do both.", "I always do. Habit that I can't break from previous employment I have.", "Good luck. Small workplaces are nice, but they're also hard. After a while, everyone tends to know your business, and some managers can lean a little too hard on \"team player\" in unfair ways.\n\nYou might tell your boss you were thinking about what they said about being a team player, and ask if it would help the situation to cross-train another person on the special tasks you and M do. Just a thought.", "Oh it is definitely inappropriate.\n\nShutting stuff like that down is sometimes harder in a smaller office, where people get overly familiar with each other's lives. In principle, it's better to take a Strong Stance, but in practice, sometimes a little finesse gets you more of what you want and less of what you don't want.", "M states it was mild, I did not decide that myself.", "Then it's on your boss to figure out how to staff in case people are out.  It's different if half the team comes down sick or something, but you have a perpetually absent worker and another that schedules time off in advance - you can't just say \"no\" later on (you can always ask, especially for emergencies, but you can't really force someone to come in).  \n\nI've taken PTO for a mental health day before.", "<<she told me it was none of my business.>>  \nBut by calling you at home, and making you do her work--she's made it YOUR business.", "Just FYI, migraines can last multiple days. They are awful. There is a reason chronic migraine is classed as a disability.", "Nah I\u2019ve just been there. \n\nIt\u2019s hard being the company well that everyone draws from without thought for your very real needs as well.", "Good luck!! But you are definitely NTA. Become a *woman of mystery*", "That's good. Because we have that policy expectations for PTO, so he should too", "NTA. You have a horrible boss though.", "No. She's been there for like 13 years and with our high turnover that's basically a lifetime.", "Thank you, that helps so much", "Yeah, I've brought it up but they want one of the other team member to have more experience before we put new tasks on them (fair).  But it's hard to be the only one in the whole company who can do certain things when M is out", "That's how I usually use my PTO as well. I am kind of burnt out there and have a home life as well with it's stressors so my PTO days are usually my reset days.", "Yeah I schedule a day every couple of months to just exist outside of work and responsibilities. I take it when my husband's in the office and kids are at school. Play video games or watch TV, just....exist lol", "That's what I thought to, but she doesn't see it that way.", "><<isn\u2019t her fault>>  When M calls OP at home, she is AT fault", "I agree. I don't need to know why anyone is off. I just hate that it impacts my days so much, but also wonder if that makes me selfish", "Yes, they are. I am aware of that based on previous employment that I've had. I've only experienced once.", "Thr audacity is strong with this place lol", "At one place I worked every time someone called out due to their child being sick the business owner would ask why the other parent couldn\u2019t stay home with the child.", "That's...sadly accurate to my time at my current job", "Oooh, that sounds fun. Keep em guessing while still doing my job well.", "Sounds like you need a new job.", "If this boss frequently acts like this it\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s a high turnover", "Oh, I don't have one of those but my arthritic father does. I could make that reality! Lol", "M doesn\u2019t sound like a great person. But the employer forced them to compete for PTO. They are the true AH in this scenario.", "It doesn\u2019t make you selfish. It just means your employer is the AH.", "My longest migraine lasted over 3 days. It was Not A Fun Time. Lol", "Noooo. NO. At that point I'd just start making things up.\n\n\"They've been recruited by the CIA and they're undercover in the middle east.

It\u2019s fine to do A favor, it\u2019s not fine to let them walk all over you.", "Unfortunately, anyone who took time off for any reason paid the price of being abused by the business owners. \n\nI used to schedule my medical appointments in the morning before work so I wouldn\u2019t inconvenience anyone.
