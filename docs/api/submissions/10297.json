And how did your rude coworker get your personal number? Block her.", "Do not answer the phone when they call if you are on an approved PTO day.", "Definitely. I've been on this team for 5 years and we know more about each other than probably acceptable. The company is predominantly female (barring CEO and my supervisor) and most between the ages of 30-45 so there's a rapport that's built up.\n\nI've learned it's a trap", "We work on a small building with less than 50 employees so my boss implemented a group chat for our team of 5 to communicate on, using personal phone numbers.", "A 14 yr old can typically be trusted to stay home with a migraine - that's old to need supervision for a sick day, assuming no extenuating factors.", "if she has time to burn let her burn her own time not bar you from using yours.", "NTA. If it\u2019s a work phone, turn it off when you leave work and turn it on when you return. If it\u2019s a personal phone, block their numbers. Stop answering on time off!", "Also be careful with HR they\u2019re there to protect the company not you. \n\nAny interaction you have with HR, a manager, or coworker that can affect your performance evaluation or be used as grounds for termination should be documented. It can be something as simple as an follow-up email detailing what you discussed in the meeting. This create a paper trail that can be used in case anyone tries to retaliate. \n\nThere is a really great Instagram account about employees rights, manipulative corporate tactics, and how to handle these situations: @attorneyryan \n\nBtw, not trying to make you paranoid. I\u2019m just trying to share some cover-your-ass information", "I am betting you don't call out for frivolous things like \"beach day\" or \"I just don't want to get out of bed, it's warm\" like your coworker (I mean a teenager with a slight headache, no fever, and no vomiting?)  \n\n\nIf that's the case, the way I would handle it is to call or message them for a call out \"I am calling out sick because of <insert illness of whoever you have to take care of> I will not be available today and will answer reasonable questions when I come in. I will not be in today.\" And then don't answer. If you are following company policy, then this message lets them know you are using your legally usable PTO for a legit reason, and that you will not be answering questions until you are on the clock. And, then, only reasonable ones.", "The entitlement of these people. Don\u2019t cave in. Also, next time when you are on PTO- simply don\u2019t answer any work call. Reply 4 hours later and said \u201csorry, I was busy.\u201d", "Good idea. And to OP: always have a lie ready. You could have told them you had a medical appointment set months ago or something like that. By the way, NTA but your boss and your colleague are both AH.", "OMG why would you even need to do that? I can just imagine if where my wife works (we live in Ontario, Canada for whatever that matters) saying that. We'd both laugh at them and continue on our day. Or hire lawyers and they'd instantly lose (more likely back right off because it's highly illegal).", ">Employers don't get it at all.\n\nNah, employers get it. They just don't care. If they can threaten their employee into compliance, they'll do it.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s none of your employer\u2019s business whether your husband can work from home or not. They definitely have no right to say he should stay home. That\u2019s appalling that they pull that crap. Next time they try it just say he can\u2019t. If they press just say that\u2019s all you\u2019re able to say. \n\nIf you can find a better employer do so!", "Nothing like a little sexism thrown in for good measure!", "Oh, just a smack dab in the middle of farming country", "Didn't it also say that M said she had to leave the teen with her mom? So a 14 year old with basic supervision. That's not really getting put in a bind. I mean I completely get wanting to be there for your kid, but that's not too bad of a situation. Now having to leave a vomiting 2 year old in the care of a 14 year old is not at all an ideal situation. So really M has no right to complain to OP.", "Yeah, 14 is definitely old enough to babysit so long as they're mature, etc. And having a 'headache' shouldn't be enough to miss school, assuming OP works normal 9-5. My mom would never let me skip school for that reason, tbh, unless it was a migraine", "Yes! Definitely do this. I\u2019m in a position where if my coworker is out (and they are out A LOT) I have to do their job and mine. But when I\u2019m out they don\u2019t have to do my job. \n\nI told my boss (who is awesome) that I\u2019m happy to be backup and put out fires as needed, but I was done neglecting my work for this person\u2019s when they suddenly decide 2 hours before work starts to take off. Oddly enough coworker has started planning time off now because apparently it sucks to \u201ccome back to a bunch of work\u201d. Huh. Funny how that happens.", "for OP: My biggest advice to follow up everyone's \"find a new job\"(cause it's so easy as a working parent to find spare time)  \nRecommendation:  Is don't tell anyone that hubby can work from home.  Let them think he has a full time in-office job, if necessary.  Not their business.", "Yeah give it a month or two and then just tell them the change has been implemented, that way it\u2019s not on the back of them wanting him to WFH so you can come into the office. Like a preemptive strike so you\u2019re covered next time this situation arises.", "Honestly you don\u2019t owe your job any explanation. In the future if your job pulls this inappropriate business and tries to pressure your husband into working from home and he can\u2019t/ doesn\u2019t want to just tell your boss that your husband isn\u2019t available/ able to and if your boss tries to press for more information tell them you aren\u2019t comfortable providing that but if they would like to continue the conversation request to bring hr on. The fact is no is a complete sentence and as an employee you have rights especially when it comes to your private life.", "You might want to not state it's the workplace, for honesty and in case the boss happens to know someone (or know someone who knows someone) who works there -- you could just say \"My husband can't do that any more\" or \"He can't do that when the kid's that sick\" or the like rather than lying that it's his workplace's decision.  \n\nYou are emphatically NTA.  Please seriously consider changing jobs -- your current workplace isn't willing to staff sufficiently, and your boss doesn't respect your time and earned benefits, let alone your husband's.  It's unlikely to get better as long as he's your boss and she's your coworker; even if that changes, it won't fix the short-staffing problems.", "On one hand I\u2019d say don\u2019t even bother lying. They don\u2019t deserve ANY kind of reason. \n\nOn the other hand make up a ridiculous and disgusting lie - \u201cyeah I can\u2019t come in as my vaginal discharge is particularly troublesome and copious today\u201d.     Bet the boss would NEVER ask again.", "I think I can see why there's high turnover", "I can see why the high turnover. NTA", "Ah, there\u2019s the answer. I worked with an M. She was a shift lead and a world class jerk-particularly to me, for some reason only she knows. She\u2019d been there for 8 years. Absolutely horrendous lead, but got away with just about anything. Turnover was nuts, in the year I worked there more people came and went than I could count. I ultimately left largely because of \u201cM\u201d and management\u2019s refusal to address it. Good luck.", "Yeah with as small as my town is, if I lied there's a 50% chance someone would find out. But my husband does a lot of calls and zoom meeting on wfh days with an office half the country away so it's no stretch to say he isn't able to. I just hate that it's now an expectation for him to.", "Loool that would almost be worth the write up he wouldd very likely give me. Making him read the reason as to why.", "Exactly my thought!", "Dude, these are so good!"]}
