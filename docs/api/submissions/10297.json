In the second case, if they've decided to accommodate her, what they need to do to do is cross-train other employees, and/or staff the workplace appropriately.\n\nIf co-workers have to give up their days off, in order to cover for M's management-sanctioned unscheduled absences, the workplace is not appropriately staffed. After all, you're not the one who decided to accommodate M.\n\nYou scheduled a day off. You did nothing wrong in taking off the day as scheduled.

Don't tell them what you're doing (because then you give your co-workers and managers the opportunity to judge whether the reason for your scheduled day is as important and someone else's reason for an unscheduled absence). Just make random comments about how busy you're going to be. \"Tomorrow is my day off, and I'd get more rest if I stayed at work.\"\n\nIf people ask what you're doing, say, \"It's personal,\" or \"It's too much to go into here, or if you want to get tongues wagging, say, \"It's a secret.\"\n\nLet them think you're having an affair with George Clooney, if they want, when really, you're just staying home to organize your spice rack and catch up on the latest season of your favorite TV show.\n\nLikewise, you said your husband has the option to work from home. It's time to shift their perception of your situation. Every time he has to go in, mention it in passing. \"Ugh, Jimmy had to go into work today. That messes up everything with Bobby's piano lessons and Suzy's soccer practice,\" or \"I hope Jimmy doesn't have to go into work tomorrow, because I was counting on him to blah blah blah,\" and \"Jimmy got called in last week. I guess his optional work-from-home is winding down.\"\n\nI'm not telling you to lie, by the way. Just use what you have and frame it such that they start to realize that while Jimmy can be home, he WORKS.

If that is the case the company is shit and hope you can find a new place. \n\nAs far as M - the way things are going I would not be surprised if she does not get let go soon due to her absences.\n\nFinally glad you talked to HR to have it documented and also to put in the radar that you should not be expected to be Ms coverage plan.", "Can't disagree there", "NTA go to your bosses boss to file a complaint about the double standard.", "Oh, don't be sorry.
