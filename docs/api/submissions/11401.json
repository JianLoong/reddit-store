I\u2019ve been a manager and have made schedules. To me availability was basically law. However I always gave preference to people with open availabilities. If you could only work 5 shift that was fine but I wouldn\u2019t guarantee that you would be scheduled for all those shifts.  So you\u2019re definitely not an asshole.

Go find yourself an office job because your childcare arrangement doesn\u2019t match your current employer\u2019s schedule. There\u2019s lots of openings for Mon.-Fri.
