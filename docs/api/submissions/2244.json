Luckily my parents didn't listen to her. Last time I saw her, she seemed almost disappointed that I realised my career goals. She obviously expected me to fail after my parents ignored her useless advice.", "you played a huge part in destroying her self-esteem. she spent years thinking she couldn\u2019t succeed because of you. you do not get to lay claim on her success just because she knew you for 9 months at 5 years old.", "LMAO.  You know what I remember from kindergarten?  Absolutely nothing.  It\u2019s not as pivotal as you think it is.  And no, you don\u2019t raise other people\u2019s children.", "The lack of logic in that statement is concerning.  Even if it truly definitively was in her best interest to be held back do you expect any child to be grateful for it?\n\nYou should be aware that the road to hell is paved with good intentions everyone has good intentions.  Even people who do horrendously bad things most the time have good intentions.  It's not an excuse.  The fact that you don't accept any responsibility for making her life more difficult the fact that your decision denied her sports, activities and made her life far harder for her.  \n\nYou made a decision seeing one tiny snapshot of her life, that decision had consequences for her that you didn't care about then, and don't care about now.\n\nHow are you acting in her best interest?\n\nSidenote, my sister was almost held back in kindergarden because she cried during a Tornado drill.  The teacher insisted it was a sign of a lack of mental maturity.  Luckily my parents told the teacher where to shove it, and she wasn't held back.  \n\nOnce your held back these days there's no catching up its basically impossible unless you drop and home school.", "Why have you come on here and asked if YTA if you can't accept what almost every poster here is saying - YTA. \n\nInstead you are being defensive. Just like when you kept pestering this woman when she said no.", "Her reasoning doesn\u2019t matter. She said no and the conversation should have ended there. You are not entitled to her time.\n\nPretty full of yourself thinking that you have anything to do with her success.", "How are you looking out for her best interests? How does doing you a favor benefit her? You don\u2019t even fucking know her outside of the one year you taught her ABC\u2019s but you\u2019re entitled to her time? YTA", "Huh, crazy, someone you're invalidating doesn't want to do you a favor. \n\n\"No\" is a complete sentence; even a Kindergarten teacher should know that.", "Her reasoning doesn't have to be valid. She experienced her life and knows more about it than you do. You have no right to demand anything from any former student.", "And one that can't tell the difference between implode and explode \ud83e\udd14", "When are you going to admit this post is fake as can be? How would you recognize an adult from when you knew them at 5 years old? What could she possibly speak on in your class? How ineffectively she colored?", "You don't get held back for bad fine motor skills. Coloring between the lines ins't a requirement for going to 1st grade as it neat handwriting. You are still learning how to write even after kindergarten.", "Because she said no the first time and you didn't accept the no.", "it\u2019s not about the request. it\u2019s about the fact that you: \n1. traumatized this woman as a child to the point that it literally changed her life \n2. your refusal to accept no as answer. No means no, as a kindergarten teacher i\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t understand that", "The original request itself wasn\u2019t unreasonable, but pushing after the first \u201cno\u201d was.\n\nAs a teacher, shouldn\u2019t you also teach kids that saying \u201cno\u201d to something is a full, valid response in itself?", "\"No.\" Is a complete sentence, since you're a teacher one would expect you to know that. You HARASSED her, she clearly didn't want to engage, you forced further conversation, when she said \"no\" you continued to harass her. You have an overinflated opinion of your contribution to her success - SHE SUCCEEDED IN SPITE OF YOU. You caused her damage and you think she owes you something because of it? She owes you NOTHING, leave her TF alone.", "Please tell me you know about consent? No is a complete sentence.", ">I'm very proud and know I played a part in her success.\n\nJust because you were their teacher doesn't mean you made any contribution's to how successful they were in the future. They put the work in, not you. I find it hard to believe you're a teacher. Your emotional maturity is lacking majorly.", "YTA. You are clearly terrible at reading the room and reading people. The conversation should have ended halfway through that encounter. The fact that you pushed your own agenda rather than empathize or apologize for the situation you put her was just wrong on so many levels. I can only imagine what kind of teacher you really are.", "Seriously?", "Saying she is \u201coverreacting\u201d is abuser speak to invalidate someone\u2019s feelings. You need to stop. YTA", "Kindergartners aren't usually asked to be kept back because they are academically behind.  That isn't a concern at that age as they will catch up with that in 1st grade.\n\nIf the kid had socialization issues, that may be a different issue but isn't usually labeled special ed at that point.", "Wake up. The answer is in your own words why you are so very much TA.", "Was there actual evidence or were you just not interested in actually playing teacher?", "She gave you direct feedback on how you made her feel and the negative impact you had in her academic journey. Instead of accepting and reflecting on this, you\u2019re doubling down and invalidating her experiences. \n\nAlso, as a kindergarten teacher, you should know no is a complete sentence. \n\nYTA", "I think you're overreacting in your reasoning. You asked someone who didn't want to talk to you for a favor. When they said no, you continued. \n\nHere's an example. \n\nWill you go on a date with me? \n\nNo. \n\nWhat??? I'm great. Go on a date with me? \n\nNo\n\nYou don't have the time for one little date? \n\n\nYou are the creepy person persistently asking for a date. You are equivalent to a creep. Then we take into account she gave you the reasons why she doesn't like you and you don't have the perspective to understand her side. \n\nFYI you should be teaching your kids no means no. Not I'm going to keep asking and you should give me what I want.", "Probably for teachers she doesn\u2019t hate.", "You\u2019re a kindergarten teacher. You\u2019re a 180 day blip in a thousands day long learning journey. The shoes they wear to school are more impactful.", "You didn't play any part in it.", "You are a kindergarten teacher. Seriously how much impact do you think you have on her? I don't even remember my kindergarten teacher. Although tbh she does remember you potentially mislabeling her as special needs and causing her harm. Who knows if she really did need extra help but her perception is negative and she's an adult. Leave her alone.", "Did you also play a part in all of the students you don\u2019t find successful? Or do you only take credit for the good parts?", "It\u2019s interesting you\u2019re so quick to claim to have played a part in her success, but are totally unwilling to consider you might have impacted her in other ways. You might want to think about that. \n\nYTA.", "I do not lack these skills at all. You\u2019ve clearly never been a teacher, we literally raise peoples children.", "I was thinking the same thing when reading this as OP didn't say why they contributed.\n\nIf anything they held the student back from achieving sooner.\n\nUnless you actually spent hours with someone, encouraged them and acted like a cheerleader or mentor, then you didn't play a part in their success. You was just in their lives briefly.", "I feel the standards this teacher set is too high of a kindergarden age. Surely those sorts of things get better in time and does not always indicate a learning disability? I am from the UK however and keeping someone back a year is very rare.", "She didn\u2019t have socialization issues. She was behind in her fine motor skills.", "She wasn\u2019t coloring inside the lines, had sloppy handwriting, and wasn\u2019t able to copy notes down from the white board quickly.", "OP should be teaching her kids no means no. Not harassing some girl to do something she doesn't want to", "She doesn\u2019t have any reason to hate me, she\u2019s overreacting", "How can you know that?", "No we don't. We teach children. Get off your high horse.", "You sound like a bad teacher", "My mother is a teacher and she does not consider herself to be raising other people's kids. That's egotistical. \n\nHere's how you lack proper skills. You approached a former student and wouldn't back off when they told you that they wouldn't come to class and didn't take no for an answer. You argued. You lack social and emotional skills.", "No, just no", "You don't, at all. Kindergarten teachers like you are literally glorified babysitters.", "No sounds like you are just a living under a bridge.", "how tf do you remember that after ten years", "Faaaaaake", "Why would a kindergartener need to copy down notes from a white board quickly? Also pretty sure you can't hold back kids for not coloring inside the lines and having sloppy handwriting. My mom has kids in her 5th grade class who are right where they need to be and can be sloppy writing.", "So she was... colouring and writing like an average kindergartener. YTA, move on.", "how tf do you remember that after ten years. i call bullshit", "AS IF you\u2019d remember this much detail like twenty years later when you\u2019ve taught hundreds of kids. Either this whole post is made up or you\u2019re now just saying any old lie because everyone thinks you\u2019re the AH and you STILL can\u2019t accept an answer you don\u2019t like.", "YTA, and certainly not a teacher. These issues would not warrant retention or sped services. I will never understand fake posters.", "And you're overreacting thinking that you contributed to her successes in life.", "You don\u2019t get to decide how other people feel about you.", "that is irrelevant.  You asked - which you are within your rights to do - she answered.  That should have been the end of it, but you pressed, and then pressed again.   Once she said no, you needed to drop it.   I don't care if she is over reacting.  I don't care if she is blaming you for what her parents did.   She said no.  That should have been the end of the conversation.", "\"Overreacting\"? Her success is IN SPITE of your actions. You don't get to tell people how to feel about what you did to them.", "Clearly there's an issue with your listening skills. Why ask people if AITA, if your not going ro listen with an open, active mind? If she's willing to talk to classes of her other teachers but not yours,  if she told you no and you didn't listen, if the while group here is telling you YTA and why but you still think you're right,  then you really do have a problem.", "OP: this and this happened, AITA?\nLiterally everyone: YES\nOP: lalalalaaaa I don\u2019t see what y\u2019all\u2019s problem is.", "How did you know that you actually did? Sounds to me like if you actually played a role, you would have had more of a relationship with this kid years later. Seems like you're only interested in her now that she's done something big and you want to take credit for her achievements.", "Because the student literally told you that any impact you had on them was negative.", "Bruh your a kindergarten teacher you didn\u2019t do jack", "You recommended she repeat because she wasn\u2019t up to your standards but she didn\u2019t and went on to be successful. Some might even say in spite of you. You had no hand in her success.", "Because if you actually had a relationship with her after kindergarten, you would know how much she dislikes you.", "Her parents caused a big stir at school because they asked for her to be evaluated by multiple child therapists. The principal declined and said that wouldn\u2019t be necessary. After it all went down I was transfer to our alternative high school.", "This!", "Everyday I have my kindergartners copy down a learning contract where they write notes on everything we are doing for the day. Sloppy write is also an indicator of poor fine motor skills. Her art skills were bad in general.", "This is the absolute fakest and weirdest shit.", "kindergarten. man, how horrible was op to this woman that she still remembers how shitty *kindergarten* was?? oof", "Your Googling of how to work in a school system is off.", "You were transferred from kindergarten to high school? I can\u2019t say for certain for everywhere, but from everything I\u2019ve seen those are different degrees and licenses.", "The more you post, the more it sounds like she succeeded *despite* of you.", "And I'm the Queen of England. You'd do that in higher grade levels. Definitely not in primary school levels. And i was bad at art and didn't get held back.", "Art skills. \ud83d\ude02 What a joke, pick a lane. Was she not doing well in her kindergarten 'learning contract' or were her art skills bad? I haven't seen you write ONE good quality about this girl either btw. So it sounds like you just tore this poor girl down and now are all surprised that she said you brought her down.", "YTA for this alone. That isn't appropriate for Kinder.", "No wonder they transferred you. They should have just fired you.", "I had my kindergarteners do this daily, so I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re talking about.", "1. I was a kindergartener once. \n2. My mother taught kindergarten.\n\nI think I actually know more than your Google search on how to be an educator."]}
