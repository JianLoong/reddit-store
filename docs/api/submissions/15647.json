They don't plan anything fancy, just a small baby shower during our lunch break. These two coworkers who are planning the party came up to me yesterday and asked me to contribute with money to the party, they said they will get some cupcakes, cake, soda and that kind of stuff. I told them they I won't give them money for this, if they want to plan this it's ok, but I couldn't care less about the pregnancy and I won't spend my money on this. They argued that pregnant coworker will be happy for the party and that helping will make me a good coworker, I said I don't care about their impressions of me. They called me a selfish asshole and left. \n\nMy girlfriend then told me I was wrong for this because it's only a couple hundred dollars so it's not that hard to help out.

I think it\u2019s also possible other people said no so they asked op for a higher amount than others. The fact that the two people argued with him about giving money is ridiculous. He may be considered rude in his workplace culture for saying no (even if he had said it politely) but maybe the environment is toxic since the coworkers seem angry about his refusal and not how he refused.", "Not necessarily. An office can have people working on $15 to $100 an hour wages and everyone has different financial backgrounds regardless of wages.", "Okay.\n\nI'm sorry, but if you're refusing to give a *small* amount (read, small amount) to your small office coworkers without explanation, then I definitely believe you to be an asshole. But it's your damn right not to do it.\n\nIt's not black and white though. If OP was asked for 5-10$ and replied \"Damn man, it's the end of the month and I can't make ends meet without - Sorry, but I would have very much liked to contribute\" then I doubt anybody would bat an eye (he's never obligated to explain, but again, this is AITA). But if you literally take OP's post and edit the amount to 5-10$ instead of 200, then I would have said he was the asshole - like I said in my comment above.", "Yeah seriously. Maybe they said $200 total for the event and since he wasn\u2019t really listening that\u2019s the number that stuck in his head.", "My immediate thought: \u201cthink of it as you\u2019re paying for the cake, not the baby, sheet cake.\u201d But $200 a person would be a custom tiered cake lol", "Oh I totally agree.  And even for friends and family 200 to help out for the shower is a lot to ask.  Especially for a party with only 7 people attending.  I would offer to bring a dish and a small gift, maybe.  Depending on how close I was to the coworker.", "Yes! I make a crappy public salary, barely enough for bills. I'm not gonna spend my money on extras, sorry. Sometimes I will draw a card or help decorate if I like the person enough.", "Wonder if the total was $200 (to be divided) and he just didn\u2019t pay enough attention to know or care \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "$20 for some cupcakes is reasonable. I'd put in $20 and go to a baby party for cupcakes and I don't like babies. But $200??? What the heck kind of cupcakes are they ordering??", "where I work, before the pandemic we would have let whoever wanted to contribute give whatever they wanted, bought a cake and whatever was left over would go in a card to the expectant mother. \n\nnow one person sends an email to the group with the deadline for contributions, everyone Venmo\u2019s whatever amount the want (or not) and the person who did the collection sends an e-gift card for the whole amount with a list of all who contributed to the expectant mother\n\nno one needs to contribute if they don\u2019t want to", "Yeah, by attend i meant more like, participating in the party, eating the food if there is any", "They must be. Assuming these two (and anyone else in the office) are also chipping in 200$, that would be $600+ for the kind of party that just needs cake? Plus a gift? \n\nNTA and just offer to buy a cake if you actually want to. Or don't, if you don't.", "They're getting cupcakes from the cake gate girl apparently. Damn that's a lot of money!", "Add it to the Auto-Mod message?\n\n\u201cRemember, OP can be legally/morally/ethically justified in their actions and *still* an asshole.\u201d", "No question on $200. Nta. But all these people saying not giving anything at all are people I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t work with.", "After 3 weeks of NO sleep, you will pay literally anything for some shut-eye. Our second would not sleep unless she was on you and I can only sleep knowing she is safely in a bassinet/crib. We tried all the tricks, different wraps, making it warm, etc - nothing. But the Snoo, with it\u2019s ridiculous price tag, did it\u2019s job for about 4-5 months. Then she transitioned to her crib beautifully. The resale value of the Snoo is also pretty good. We got half our money back.", "I've never once heard of a new parent complaining that they have too many diapers", "We really don\u2019t know where they work and what he does. There is nothing to me rude about simply asking because like I said we don\u2019t know if this is normal for their workplace or not. Not that how much he makes means he has to give money to them but it could be normal if these are people make a good amount of money. I mean the lady went through fertility treatment. She probably doesn\u2019t make minimum wage.", "Damn right , it is his right  to not want to contribute : You didn\u2019t read when I said , him not wanting to contribute ONE PENNY does not make him an asshole . You are free to contribute any amount you want . It\u2019s your money and only you can make that decision.", "it\u2019s only a central point only because it\u2019s affecting the way people are voting, and OP knows that. i don\u2019t like when people manipulate the audience into getting the answer they want when the debate over 20 dollars is a lot easier to have than 200. i pretty much determined by the way he described the situation that he was TA until i got to that number, and then when i saw the way he was kind of like \u201clol idk\u201d when people asked if that number was real i didn\u2019t care what they asked, he\u2019s an asshole and the only thing left to figure out is how much we can rely on his account of their assholiness", "Oh yeah, you could definitely sign the card without giving anything and nobody would care. I don't think anyone was keeping track unless you didn't have the cash on collection day and told the person organising it that you wanted to bring some another day.", "Who cares? $200 per person for an office baby shower?? Absolutely not.", "if he's a manager why are they so comfortable calling him an asshole to his face.", "That would make more sense. Managers wind up having to kick in a bit for office parties.", "That could definitely be the case based on comments he made.\n\n>Q: Are you absolutely positive you didn\u2019t mis-hear? Anything up to $20 is completely normal for this kind of thing. And assuming you\u2019ll partake in the coffee break and eat food, you should contribute. $200 is absurd\n\n>OP: It's a possibility since I was working when they came up to me, idk\n\n>Q: Are you sure you didn't misunderstand? Maybe they were trying to raise $200 total, not asking you for that amount as an individual.\n\n>OP: Well, it's q possibility since they asked me while I was typing in my computer, but knowing them I think they might want to buy expensive desserts and some gifts too", "Even if that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s still NTA.", "Yeah he can decide not to participate. I just get the feeling that with some of the coworkers, being in the same room would be as good as participating.", "Personally I think \u201cjustified\u201d should be its own verdict, but I recognize that could get complicated.", "I can see the \"you don't have to\" because, yeah, obviously, it's your money. But people are also suggesting they've struggled before and others saying a little donation is good manners means \"they clearly don't know what it's like to be pay check to pay check\". \n\nI grew up poor and THAT is why I have this mindset. If you can afford to spare $5, you do it because community is built on kindness and reasonable support.\n\n Maybe that sounds a bit dramatic based on a post about an office party, but I just think a kind gesture demonstrates good morals. That's how I was raised. This world is too cold and heartless already for people to make a big deal over a couple of bucks they can afford to spare.", "Probably not 200 per person.  200 for him so everyone else can be cheaper, or not pay at all.", "Honestly, I can't even imagine being comfortable with ANY coworker enough to call them an asshole in a serious tone. Unless they were doing something outrageously rude, like running me over with their car or something.", "Same. I\u2019m not particularly interested in being friends with anyone I work with, so I don\u2019t participate in the social activities in and outside of work. I think I\u2019ve been to one office potluck, and even then left after only 10-15 minutes.", "It's pretty easy to not eat the food purchased specifically for the party. It may not be easy to not be physically near the party, but if you're not actively engaging in it and not consuming anything purchased for the party then that's a pretty clear indication that you're not participating.", "Why aren't the coworkers assholes for demanding that people give money and give up their lunch hour to throw a party for someone one may not even like?", "So he refuses to give his money to a coworker and that's shows he doesn't care? My pappa died and none of my coworkers gave money or food. Did I deem them mean or a holes? No, because I know I'm not entitled to anyone's money. In this day, money getting harder and harder to stretch and deeming someone a jerk because they refused to give it to you is nothing short of entitlement.", "I dont know most of these people outside of work. Are they the kind of people who let their cat walk around on the kitchen counter? Do they wash their hands before preparing food? Its just one of those things i cant get past. Also my lunch break is just that, a break. Its 30 minutes that i can sit quietly, clear my head, and eat my lunch. I dont want to lose that for some crappy meatballs that have been sitting in a crock pot for god knows how long.", "Because $20 and a lunch break is not an unreasonable ask to support someone you work closely with who is going through a major life event. In exchange, you get a cupcake and you stay in the good graces of your coworkers.", "Nobody is saying they can't be. ESH is an option, after all.", "If someone is asking for a small amount of cash, like <$20, then yes you would likely be perceived as an asshole for refusing. It would communicate that you don\u2019t care enough to make a very small donation, even if that\u2019s not how you feel. Again, is it morally wrong to refuse to donate any amount of money? No. But you\u2019ll look like an uncaring jerk and in a small office setting that\u2019s not a good look. \n\nAnything more than $20 and I think most reasonable folks would be more understanding and receptive to a refusal. If his coworkers really did ask him for $200 and pressured him when he refused, then they are absolutely being assholes. But it sounds like OP wasn\u2019t listening very carefully and didn\u2019t fully understand the request, which in itself also kind of communicates that he\u2019s a standoffish jerk. That may not be true at all, but perception matters. If nothing else, it shows a lack of social skills."]}
