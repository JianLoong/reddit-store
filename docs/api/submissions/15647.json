These two coworkers who are planning the party came up to me yesterday and asked me to contribute with money to the party, they said they will get some cupcakes, cake, soda and that kind of stuff. I told them they I won't give them money for this, if they want to plan this it's ok, but I couldn't care less about the pregnancy and I won't spend my money on this. They argued that pregnant coworker will be happy for the party and that helping will make me a good coworker, I said I don't care about their impressions of me. They called me a selfish asshole and left. \n\nMy girlfriend then told me I was wrong for this because it's only a couple hundred dollars so it's not that hard to help out.

Your girlfriend is wrong. It's \"only\" x amount of money is always applicable when it isn't your money being spent. $200 is a couple nice meals out, or a grocery budget for that payperiod.
