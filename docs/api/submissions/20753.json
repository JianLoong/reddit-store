And please, if you have any idea of what it sounds like my son might have, please please please let me know in the comments. His doctor won't evaluate him without going through the school and school is over. \n\nMy wife and I have my niece (10) every day from 6am to 4pm while her mother sleeps from working the overnight. We have 2 kids (12f and 6m). Now, as you've gathered, my son has issues. He is so quick to anger. Like he has absolutely no emotional regulation whatsoever. He's off the walls entirely. He's always running, jumping, climbing on things, hiding under things, making animal noises (like dinosaur noises), etc. Even if he's on his tablet. He will be super involved with his tablet (the only thing that keeps him calm) but he will make squawking or screeching sounds randomly. Like stimming! I guess. But like, even if he is having a fantastic day, all it takes is one super minor trigger and all bets are off. My wife is a fantastic mom. She can usually calm him no problem. But my niece is absolutely a trigger. She purposely makes him feel like he isn't included or she doesn't want him around, but she will make sure to manipulate my daughter in to not including her brother too. It's been causing one too many freak outs. \n\nYesterday I absolutely had enough because I have openly told my niece to cut the shit on more than one occasion and she won't. She will wait until I walk away to start shit talking me to my daughter and then will get an attitude and start bossing my daughter around and still not include my son at all. My daughter is sweet as a peach without this girl around and there's no issues usually. But yesterday my niece wouldn't stop so I told her to stay away from my kids. Told her to go play by herself. I told my sister what happened when she picked her kid up and she was pissed at me because \"it's not my kids fault that she can't tolerate your son and his behaviors. You're putting too much on her.\" I told her that it's one thing to not have tolerance and a completely separate issue when it comes to being a bullying asshole. She said I can no longer watch her kid (good) but now my family is ganging up on me.\n\nETA: my daughter doesn't like my niece, nor does she want to hang out with her (she's asked me several times to not have my niece here) but even if she did, that has nothing to do with my post. Please stick to the question. Maybe I should have clarified more: my son does not even need to be near my niece. She has gone out of her way several times to go to him while he's on his tablet on the couch to poke at him and cause tension.

I\u2019ve got a step sister that we had to also keep away from my brother due to reasons like this. (My lil bro has pending ADHD and other learning disabilities that cause temper and sensory issues. He\u2019s also glued to his tablet whenever he gets his hands on it) My step sister loved to just toy with him and cause issues and it\u2019s completely okay that you try to separate your niece and son if there\u2019s pending diagnosis on the way that may cause his behaviours. In the best way possible, your son could be a ticking time bomb if set off the wrong way and until you find out what\u2019s really going on it\u2019s best to keep triggers like that away from him until you can find out what\u2019s wrong and fully understand how to handle him going forward.", "NTA, if your niece is triggering your son and knows that but still actively tries to get on his nerves. It seems like your niece is the kind of kid that wants a reaction from others or more attention for something because she really is doing the most. \n\nMaybe your son has ASD, it's a very broad spectrum. What kind of symptoms does your son show?", "I\u2019m a tad conflicted. On the one hand, I\u2019d want to say what an awful little girl. But I have to stop and check my - and your - swing here. What 10 and 12 year old girls want a six year old boy tagging along and included in what they are doing? Them all doing the same things together would seem to be an exception rather than a rule, these are very different ages.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if your niece is actively going after and targeting the kid. It\u2019s quite another if you are looking at this boy\u2019s sister and niece as playthings to occupy his time. And I sort of get a latter vibe from your post\u2026. And this gets reinforced by your sister\u2019s comment - she isn\u2019t defending her daughter being a bully, she\u2019s calling you out for putting so much on her daughter, AKA expecting the girls to be built in daycare.\n\nDon\u2019t know enough to put an AH Judgement, as depending on the details, this wildly swings from bratty Niece to overbearing expectations from her uncle.", "INFO: You post says your mad because she's leaving him out. But you comments say it's because she's poking at him when he's trying to be by himself. So which is it?", "Sounds like your son could possibly have adhd or is on the spectrum.", "Your son reminds me of my brother who was diagnosed as a child with Autism, ADHD, and oppositional defiance disorder.  It\u2019s very common to have a child to be both ASD and ADHD.  ODD is often common with ASD because these children have difficulty expressing themselves so they become frustrated/overwhelmed which causes them to lash out.  i call it a trilogy of heartache.  The niece is 10 years old and I highly doubt she comprehends the severity of your son\u2019s inability to cope.  Honestly, for the niece, her cousin is probably not enjoyable to be around with unpredictability and his outbursts.  You want her to understand something you don\u2019t fully understand. \n\ni grew up with a sibling much like you son and it was very difficult to have a relationship because I didn\u2019t understand the limitations and having to tiptoe around to not rock the boat.  The niece is being an average kid who is struggling with the expectations that the household has to revolve around 1 person.  It is very hard for a kid digest and cause sibling resentment.\n\nI will also suggest discussing with your daughter because she may feel \u201cinvisible\u201d at times due to your son\u2019s needs.  His lack of control impacts the whole house.  His need are important but don\u2019t overlook your other child.", "ESH - your sister is putting you in a crap position when you obviously already have a heaping ton of shit on your plate HOWEVER it is NOT the responsibility of the children (your daughter or your niece) to appease or conform to your sons obvious issues. 3 things i as an internet stranger recommend \n\n1. Stop watching your niece BUT also apologize to your sister and niece and explain that you have enough on your plate without adding another child to it\n\n2. Get your son an appointment with a child psychologist to be evaluated for Autism and ADHD\n\n3. Most importantly imo get your daughter not only evaluated for both autism and adhd as well (it is genetic and often undiagnosed in minor females) but also in with a therapist who will help her navigate any completely reasonable feelings she may be having regarding the situation with her brother and with her cousin. I know that your son is the squeaky wheel right now but if you're gonna bust out the grease you may as well grease all the wheels yea?", "ESH.   It\u2019s like no one here has emotional control.", "Has it occurred to you that your 12 year old daughter might actually welcome the opportunity to play with someone closer to her own age without her much younger brother who has serious issues?", "NTA based on the edit.  Your niece loves provoking him and then uses that response as an excuse to exclude him.\n\nAs for what your son has, take him to a diagnostic psychologist and have them test him.  Your doctor doesn't need to be involved in that process.", "I'm surprised your sister doesn't discipline her daughter - treating her cousin so poorly instead of blaming him.  He sounds like he might be on the spectrum?  I don't know where you live, but his doctor should be testing him - I don't understand why it has to go through school??  It's a medical issue, not an academic issue.\n\nYour sister is parenting out of guilt (I think).  She doesn't punish her daughter's poor behavior because she feels guilty she has to work and probably doesn't spend a lot of time with her. If she thinks her daughter can't \"tolerate\" her cousin, then maybe she should TEACH her about tolerance.  She's 10, not stupid.  Her daughter's behavior and bullying will get worse, and I don't see your sister stepping up any time soon.  So be glad you don't have to watch her.   \n Whomever watches her next (god forbid they have kids), will be treated the same.  Maybe someone other than yourself might give your sister a wake up call.  NTA  Good luck!", "NTA - A 10 yr old has the capability to follow through on your requests. She does ahole moves: shit talking you, getting and attitude and bossing. She can control these behaviors but chooses not to. The family ganging up on you can open their doors to watch your niece. Your sister lacks insight and empathy. It's best your house return to 2 kids.", "NTA \n\nHopefully you won\u2019t have to deal with this anymore. Your sister is doing you a favor, especially if your kids don\u2019t want their cousin to come over", "ESH\n\nIt definitely sounds like your neice bullies your son. You have too much on your plate to add her to your daily work. If you can't safely supervise them, including having clear reasonable expectations for their behavior that you can enforce, stop trying to do it anyway.\n\nIs your older child expected to supervise and entertain her brother a lot of the time? You say your niece's triggering your son is to get your daughter to play with her, without him. Why does that work for her? Is there an acceptable way for the older girls to play away from him? Or is your daughter his default companion?\n\nI think you were okay separating your niece for her persistent bullying. But all of those kids need more attention and support from adults than they are getting. Your sister could help teach your niece more appropriate ways to get what she wants and needs. But I'm not sure what that would be. How would she get to play with your daughter, away from your son's distracting behavior, in an acceptable way? Do you have options for your kids to be safe and separate during the day? Or is brother watching expected, all day?\n\nThere's no shame in having limits to what you can safely and successfully take on. Adding daily babysitting of your niece was over your limit.", "Have you been to the doctor and does the school have any ideas?  Your description I\u2019d say autism or ADHD. But no one here is a doctor. Especially not with such little information. Do him a favour and take him to the doctor. Having a diagnosis helps kids not feel so different from everyone. \n\nNTA for trying to make a safe place for your kids. Each kid should have a safe quiet place they can be, and hopefully your son having a safe place will help him not feel overwhelmed which should ease some of his triggers.", "ESH. Someone needs to be giving son appropriate sensory outlets. Niece may be nd herself and can\u2019t handle the noises and sensory input from your son so she does the only thing she can to make them stop. Too much focus is on the behavior and not enough on the cause and accommodation for everyone.", "NTA I would have stopped watching her long before it got to this point.", "OP, you need to get a new Doctor! Your son sounds like he could be both ASD and ADHD. My grandson is and we paid for private testing, because the wait list to have him tested at school was 2 years. \n\nBTW, NTA.", "NTA\u2026\n\nI will say this (pls do not take offense) you are going to experience this often with other children. Watching these interactions is going to be heartbreaking to watch. Trust me I know first hand. Keep in mind that your niece is 10 and in her mind she probably thinks he is super annoying. I\u2019m not defending her.\n\nRaising your voice at her is not going to help but I understand your frustration. I don\u2019t know if it is possible to pull her aside and say something to the effect \u201cwhat you just said was inappropriate, hurt my feelings etc.\u201d\n\nNext issue\u2026why hasn\u2019t your pediatrician refer you to or give you information on the early intervention program that is offered by the school district?", "I am not a professional licensed to diagnose, I'm just a parent of a child with similar behaviors. My son is Autistic and ADHD. He struggles with emotional regulation and needs almost constant sensory input. \n\nMy question is what does his doctor want the school to screen for? If it's Autism, you should definitely find another provider to do testing ASAP. The school only evaluates for \"educational autism,\" not \"medical autism,\" and apparently, they are different. From what I've gathered, autism testing in most areas has a long wait list, so you'll want to get on that soon. \n\nIf they're screening for ADHD, that is much easier to be tested for. My son was diagnosed by a psychiatrist. You might also want to consider trying to get that done this summer so if he does receive a diagnosis of ADHD, you can come up with a game plan as far as meds or therapies, and can request an IEP (if necessary) at the start of the school year. \n\nThis whole process was... a process! I'm happy to share my experiences if you have any questions.", "It sounds like your kid is the one whose the problem.

It sounds like you are indeed trying to be a dick with phrases like \"Mystical Woman Power\" and \"Penis Exemption.\" WTF\nAlso OP, you're NTA", "What the actual fuck is wrong with you?", "yeah, same here. I'm trying to keep an open mind and I see the points of people saying ESH/YTA but I do also really feel for the younger kid. of course, a 10 year old shouldn't and can't deal with OP kid's issues but OP is still the parent and responsible for looking after his child, even if it means telling off the niece, IMO.", "At first I agreed, seems like a normal 6 yo boy, but my son did have some of the above behaviors (at that age, we worked with him on controlling emmotions, learning strategies, etc.), but as a teen his therapist recommended we talk to his doctor about being tested for ADHD. My son has ADHD, but because we worked with him so much on strategies we thought were helpful for life and learning, he was not diagnosed until a teen. In addition, because we had taught him so well managing skills, medication was the next step. (My husband disagrees with the medication, but the proof is my usually A and B student that went to C and D, is back to good grades and happier on the medication).\n\n\nOP you definitely need a different pediatrician who will recommend and refer you to a proper Psy.D. there is 0 reason to wait.", "Have you ever been around 10 yr old girls? I was a girl scout leader for years and from my experience this is 100% typical 10 yr old girl.", "Really my ESH boils down to OP is the adult and he has now made a child (his niece) feel like she is the problem when in all reality the root of the problem is OPs son. And i am likely bringing my own trauma into it but it seems like females are often put in a place where they *must* control their emotions and responses in order to appease the males in their life. If OP can't or even just doesn't *want* to watch his niece that's 100%fine but he shouldn't make her feel it is her fault.", "I am a teacher and have taught this age group. It is NOT typical for a 10 year old girl. It is more typical for 12-13.\n\nEdit: Though I have also known 5 year old girls to do this. Typically from 7-10 they don't do this. They still have other problematic behaviors.\n\nEdit #2: To be clear, exclusionary behaviour is seen in all age groups. This petty announcing of exclusionary behaviour is NOT common at 10."]}
