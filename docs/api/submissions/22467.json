So me and my mom were struggling with money and my mom gets paid money for me from the government but ever since I started getting older my mom\u2019s just completely stopped even helping me with the money going to get groceries or even wanting to buy me clothes for school or important girl needs. So I was like you know what I\u2019m just gonna get a job for myself to provide for me so I got a job been working for about a month and a half and it\u2019s been going well but also during this time I was living at my sisters for like 4 months cause my mom was out there doing whatever she wanted. But she would stop by my sisters and ask me for money like $40 or $50 bucks for bills and rent so that I could \u201ccome home \u201c but my pay checks aren\u2019t that much usually $147 to $250. \n\nI always gave it to her so suddenly I came home after 4 months of me living with my sister but before I went shopping for like the week. And I got a pack of Carne Asada for $20 bucks which for me was a scam but whatever. So that night I went to sleep and then got up in the morning for work I went to work and then when work was over I walked home and got in the house and she told me she cooked so I said thank you \ud83d\ude0a I went to my room cause I wasn\u2019t hungry at the moment and I came out later on and was looking for my meat and I asked her she said she cooked it and gave some to her friend and she also ate some which got me upset because she wants to eat the food I bought with cash for me because she doesn\u2019t want to get food for us with her $600 dollars on food stamps. So I don\u2019t know if you guys have to deal with parents like this but yes I do also just make it more clear she\u2019s an alcoholic she\u2019s been ever since I was born.
