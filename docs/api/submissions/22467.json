So I don\u2019t know if you guys have to deal with parents like this but yes I do also just make it more clear she\u2019s an alcoholic she\u2019s been ever since I was born.

She is stealing from you, literally.\n\nNTA, but stop giving her money. Stop being a doormat.", "NTA.", "Emancipated minor.", "NTA. Mom's using you to fund her life. Go back to sis, get the food stamps transferred to her. Find out about any child support too. All that money is for your support, you should not have to work just to feed yourself.\n\nMom is toxic. Cut her off when you get out.", "ESH. If I understand correctly you put the food in her fridge right? Did you label it as yours with your name or something? I can\u2019t really fault your mom for seeing food in her own fridge and cooking it. The money issue is something else entirely, if she\u2019s already getting money from the government for your care then you don\u2019t have to pay her anything. Going forward I would stop giving her your money and start labeling your food if you put it in her fridge.", "NTA I think you should ask if you can stay with your sister and not give your mother money. Do well in school and go to college or get into a trade. Some trades pay well. You can do better and have a better life.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mother is failing to meet your basic needs. She shouldn't be taking things from you, that's not how that relationship is supposed to go. \n\nWhile I think AA has some cult-like aspects to it, I do think there is some wisdom to be had amongst the preachings, and Al-Anon might be a great resource for you. It is a program and regular meeting for loved ones of alcoholics, with some aspects of AA incorporated. If nothing else, it is a room full of people who have the best chance at understanding what you're going through.\n\nI can see you're in a really tough spot right now. I would recommend continuing to strengthen your bond with your sister. Is living with her until you turn 18 an option? Have you spoken to a guidance counselor at school? An education might seem like something that can be put on the back burner right now, but I promise you it is the thing that will enable you to live your life separate from family as needed.  \n\nI wish you nothing but the best - you're in a tough spot but you clearly have a head on your shoulders and if you keep moving forward, someday this is going to be the memory of \"the hard times\".", "Nta you should move back with your sister. Your sister can get food stamps by adding you on that case. Report what's going on to the caseworker because that help was meant for you and she's not using it on you.", "NTA- But people show you who they are and your mother is a taker. I moved out when I was 16 and am NC with my mother who was exactly the same. I've supported myself ever since and forgiven my mother for who she is but I limit her access to me even if she asks me for money, in fact its the only reason she ever gets in touch. Have peace with what you decide is healthiest for you but keep your finances private and inaccessible to your mother; I don't know why they feel so entitled. You can decide to help her but it will never stop and she will never pay you back, just be at peace with that. Good luck.", "Nooooo NTA. Your mom is already getting the food stamps that are supposed to be feeding you- you don't owe her anything else.\n\n1) Take a look at the the stuff here - they have online chat groups filled with kids going thru the same stuff. You are definitely not alone and other people have come up with some good ideas. https://al-anon.org/newcomers/teen-corner-alateen/\n\n2) Ask your sister if she'd be your foster parent for a year.

This is classic - even down to the fact that she\u2019s giving your stuff away to her friends, to look generous.\n\nPeople like this think the world owes them something, and if people have more money than them, then those people are rich and should be giving it away to help people like her. They will shake people down for every penny, call them stuck up if they refuse, and take six miles when given an inch. And once they have found a good thing, they\u2019re going to alert everyone else to that fact so they look like the generous one. Hey everyone, look at this free ride I\u2019m getting - hop on board! \n\nMy uncle is like this. Swindles my grandparents out of everything. They give him money for necessities, he blows it on entertainment for he and his friends. They buy him a house so that he can have somewhere safe and comfortable for his kids during his custody time - he gets a girlfriend, moves her and her kids into his daughters\u2019 bedrooms, and makes his daughters sleep elsewhere. Then he destroys the house with cigarette smoke and physical damage, and then asks for more. Goes around calling my aunts and mom (his sisters) rich assholes  (they\u2019re thoroughly middle class, standard homeowners with mortgages and debts) to anyone who will listen for not giving him money for necessities - and in the same breath uses his parents\u2019 money to buy his girlfriend a diamond engagement ring and wants to have a big (second) wedding. Shows up to every single potluck late and without food. Visited my grandfather in hospice until they found out my aunt had power of attorney and grandpa couldn\u2019t give him money, and then never visited again. Showed up to my grandfather\u2019s funeral and attempted to steal everything that wasn\u2019t nailed down. The fucking *decorations* at the funeral that were either donated by the church or merely loaned on display from his grandchildren for the service. \n\nThis will never end. Take this advice.

As a minor, your mother should be financially supporting you.  As others have said, she is using you.  Move back in with your sister and have her help you open a checking account in your name.

There are two people in that house and the mother knew she didn\u2019t buy the food. Cooking it is one thing, giving it away such that the girl had none left?
