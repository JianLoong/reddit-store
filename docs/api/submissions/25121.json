I said it was bc I thought he didn't care about his last name whereas my last name is very important to me. \n\nContext:\nI never changed my last name when we got married because in my culture this is uncommon  and my name also has very heavy cultural and historical significance. I am extremely proud of it and I am also very close  with my extended family. My husband  has no relationship with his family, as his parents abandoned him to his uncle who abused him for years until he moved in with me. \n\nWhen we were getting married he  wanted to change his last name to mine bc he feels like my family is his real family, which I was ok with but eventually we decided he doesn't need to go through that hassle since he's a part of our family regardless. He's never expressed any type of interest in his heritage (Irish) and even when I suggested we go visit Ireland he was uninterested.\n\nBut now, he said people will think the kid is not his, and that it's disrespectful to have kids not take the fathers last name. I was  confused because he has never expressed any such sentiment before. I told him my last name is nonnegotiable, so we can hyphenate it. He was resistant since both our last names are clunky and long, but eventually he said only if HIS name comes first. I got really annoyed at his implication that there's something wrong with taking the mom's last name, so maybe I was a little petty and said \"suits me, that way people will think your name is just a middle name and mine is their last name\". He told me I was being an asshole and left the house, it's been a couple of hours and he's responding to my texts with one word responses.\n\nEDIT: I am seeing some misunderstanding about why he never changed his last name to mine. I thought it was a good idea and so he was doing research on the process, but ended up complaining to me that the process seemed like a big hassle. After which I told him that my family loves him regardless of what name he has, so he decided to not go through with it. Right now we decided to discuss this whole thing in the morning after we get some sleep, and I will try to offer some of the suggestions people made in the replies.

I do think you should revisit him changing his name to yours so you're a \"matching\" family since it seems to be bothering him already - it will only get worse. My partner and I aren't married and when we had kids they took his surname, mostly because I loathe my surname and didn't want to pass on the bullying I endured because of it. It was all fine at the time but now I do feel like an outsider sometimes and while I recognise that it's silly and doesn't matter I do wish we all had the same name or at least that my kids had my name. If I get called Mrs Partnersurname by the school one more time I swear I will lose my shit lol.", "This makes me think he should take your last name. And then the baby will have \u201chis\u201d last name.", "ESH. In 2023, neither parent has the right to assume that their child will take only their last name. This is something you and your husband should have discussed a long time ago. You discussed whether you would take his last name and whether he would take yours. Why didn\u2019t your potential kids\u2019 last names come up during those conversations?", "NTA\n\n\nBut maybe he should still change his name? Make your name is name and everything would be good for both of you?", "NTA. I didn\u2019t change my name. My husband always assumed the kids would have my name. It\u2019s common and easy to spell and pronounce. His is German and difficult.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both equally making assumptions and telling the other that certain things are nonnegotiable.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to negotiate.  You have to meet in the middle, there\u2019s going to have to be some give on both sides.  This is your *child* - not a fight that one of you \u201cwins\u201d.", "NTA maybe it\u2019s time for him to take your name so you can all have a family name", "Hyphenating is the answer here. You probably should have just left it at that. You didn't really need to point that out. Should have just taken the win.", "NTA, my parents hyphenated their surnames (mums was first). I believe flow should dictate the order of the surnames that are hyphenated rather than because it\u2019s mum or dads", "NTA. This sudden attitude of his is definitely... weird. I'd remind him of when he wanted to change his last name to yours, and suggest he now take the time to do that, that way the three of you will have the same last name. Easy peasy.\n\nETA: I agree that this should be calmly talked over since this clearly has become a bit of a hot-button issue, but I also don't totally begrudge OP from kind of assuming the baby would get her last name considering all the other discussions they have had about their last names.", "NAH I get that you're attached to and like your last name.\n\nBut, I'm sure he is feeling pushed aside.\n\nHe has no family.\n\nHis wife didn't want to tie herself to him by taking his name.\n\nAnd now, she's telling him that the kids aren't allowed to have his last name either.\n\nI'm sure he is feeling very alone and unwanted right now.", "NTA, why is it just expected the child would take his last name? You are the one carrying the child. I do understand him wanting it though, maybe a hyphenated last name?", "I have both my parents last name, is that something you could do too? Like in my passport it's one middle name and one last name, but in \"life\" I've always had both last name and used them both every time I write my full name", "NTA. First of all, if this was a story from the perspective of the father, nobody would bat an eyelash about your assumption; but the fact of the matter is that these traditions have no logical basis in the modern world. Your names and traditions are equally important. As for your comment about the baby's name, it's very clear you had a rational reason to assume your name would be prioritized. He literally almost took it himself. If my wife wanted my name for herself I think I'd be quite surprised to find she'd object to our children having it. His reasoning, by contrast, is based in an outdated tradition that, as stated, he *himself* already almost bucked. Hyphenating is the clear answer (even if his family wasn't in the picture, his name is still his) but his desire to be *prioritized* in the hyphenation still reeks of the double-standard. I'm not a dad so again, grain of salt, but it's odd he feels he needs to 'win' here.", "NTA: he was even going to change his. It makes more sense for children to have yours", "NTA if you are the primary caretaker. My siblings had their dad's last name and my mom always had to go through sooooo much paperwork to prove we were her kids for stuff like school pickups, getting copies of government docs, and anything hospital related. It's a big headache. If you are planning on doing most or all of the child rearing then having only your last name makes the most sense.", "I am very attached to my last name, was quite insulted to get cards and such as Mrs such and such after I married. I felt like my identity was lost. Didn't change my name until 2 years after bc I couldn't take the nagging. Got divorced 2 years later and had to change my name . Never again.", "NTA\n\nYou've been extraordinarily clear about your last name whereas he has changed his stance to the point I am guessing he was hiding his true feelings or straight up lying to you.", "NTA. But I think this is largely a cultural issue & it might help if he can see it that way.", "1. Your husband is pregnant as well? Congrats! \n\n2. By his logic ,wouldn\u2019t strangers think the baby is not yours because it doesn\u2019t have your last name? Why would people think is not his baby because it has your last name? \n\n3. You tried to reach a compromise and he still was an asshole about it.", "NTA. He should take your name, and you will all have the same name. People will assume it\u2019s HIS name anyway.", "Leave him be to settle down. Stop texting him. Tell him since you kept your name, you want the kids to have that name. There is just as much validity to that as having his name. \n\nIn my country, usually hyphenated names are Mom-Dad not Dad-Mom. Just make sure that the D-M naming doesn't cause more confusion.\n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nIf you ADULTS can't communicate and agree on last names, I'm concerned for how you'd ever coparent a kid", "I'm going NAH. It could also be E-S-H, but I'm going to say you both just got fired up and can sit down and respectfully discuss it.\n\nTo be fair to your husband, though, without a conversation about it, I don't see why anyone would assume you'd be going against the grain to be honest. That's not to say there's anything wrong with it, it's just not presumed.", "I'm torn between YTA & ESH. Your husband absolutely overreacted but this was something you should have discussed and agreed on, not simply assumed, particularly in this case where you know that his heritage is a difficult subject for him. Also, just because he hasn't previously expressed any interest in his heritage doesn't mean he hasn't been thinking about it, partiularly now that he's about to be a father.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with any of your reasoning, but this baby is part of both of you, everything needs to be discussed and agreed and you cannot assume anything, also, given his background and desire to be part of a family, didn't it occur to you that having his child be called a name different from his might be very upsetting for him? Like he was being rejected. Again. And your retort was simply nasty, particularly when taking what you've told us about his family into consideration.\n\nYou need to stop assuming and start communicating.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s too late for him to change his last name to yours. It makes total sense that given he literally wanted your last name, you assumed he wouldn\u2019t have strong feelings about the kids. Hyphenating is a reasonable compromise but not if he plans to basically pretend your name is just a middle name.\n\nHe\u2019s just being sexist and selfish.", "ESH\n\nThis should have been discussed before you fell pregnant or even when you both were choosing a name.\n\nYou both need to sit and have a mature conversation about this. As long as he's on the birth certificate nobody is gonna question if he's the dad.", "NTA. Making assumptions would normally make you the AH, but given the amount of evidence you have, to the point that your husband was even going to take on your name, I would say that your assumption was a very safe one.", "YTA for assuming and doubling down to explain why you think your last name is more important after he told you how he felt about it related to your kids. You\u2019d made your mind up without speaking to your husband/the child\u2019s father. He go defensive and you both said stupid things. But imagine if the situation was reversed and your husband came in hot at you over the topic. Would you have felt respected? You really cut your nose off to spite your face by getting defensive though. You wanting to share your last name with the kids is 100% valid. But rather than speaking about it and deciding together you did what you did. And then didn\u2019t take a beat to even truly consider his point of view or how your actions made him feel. I get why he was pissed. You both need to apologize for how you spoke to each other, but you need to own your assumption and how it helped create this situation in the first place.", "NTA my son took my last name because it meant more to me", "NTA, why is it okay for the husband to assume it will be his last name but not her? yeah it\u2019s the norm in most places but him wanting to take her last name to me sounds like a good reason to assume the kids would also have her last name as well. maybe i\u2019m a little biased because i already think it\u2019s stupid kids normally get their fathers last names, especially when they usually aren\u2019t the ones pregnant and birthing the kid. also if anyone thinks the kid isn\u2019t his a simple \u201cthey are my child, we gave them my wife\u2019s last name because it\u2019s very significant to her and her culture\u201d will clear that up.", "I'm gonna say YTA for *assuming* because you didn't talk to him about this first.\n\nThis sounds like you two need to have a conversation where both of you are willing to hear the others reasons, so that you can come to a compromise.\n\nI understand your context, but this still is a big choice - one that he should have a say - but not the *entire* say in.", "NAH, as it seems you both have a lot of value in your last name. If he's willing to change his last name to your it may not be because it's your name. He may just feel like he wants his name to have as much significance as your name through your child. While yours is very important for you, having the child with his may add value to a very painful part of his life. I definitely say talk about it more with him and try understanding his reasoning as much as possible.", "You both need to grow tf up before you\u2019re left responsible for a whole human ESH", "ESH", "ESH\n\n-You assumed\n\n-He emasculated (purely going by your phrasing)\n\n-He\u2019s distraught over not having a name for his family (parents abandoned plus no connection to roots: clearly you understand how much familial roots matter)\n\n-You\u2019re pregnant and both of you are fighting\n\nToss a coin to decide who\u2019s name comes first", "YTA.  You shouldn't have assumed this and presented it like a forgone conclusion.  Imagine how it would have felt if he did that to you. Imagine if he dismissed your identity.  Your arrogance in your pride is doubly worse due to your disdain for his heritage.  \n\nAlso, from a practical perspective -imagine him traveling with your child with a passport with different names ... It'd be a red flag for child trafficking.", "ESH you both assumed something different because you guys didn\u2019t COMMUNICATE.", "ESH. No one should ever assume anything, and both you and your partner should have talked about this before you got pregnant.", "ESH. You are both acting like toddlers. Grow up. And I hope you both love your child enough NOT to give them a hyphenated last name.", "YTA you should obviously give your child both last names. It is your shared child not just yours. My parents never married and are from different cultures I have both names because I share both cultural heritages.", "YTA \n I would assume the child is not his child. \n This is definitely something that should have been discussed before marriage. I understand people\u2019s cultures are different but, Men can have very strong feelings about their child\u2019s last name. This is going to lead to resentful behavior no matter what the name is now. My wife was excited about changing her last name to mine when we got engaged. If she came at me with the \u201cI\u2019m not gonna change my name & children will have my last name\u201d \n I would have just asked for the ring back, paid the child support & moved on since our family values & goals don\u2019t align.", "YTA, kids should take the dads name.

My wife has a known name in her industry and she has two surnames- you could\u2019ve went the same way and then kid could have two as well ?", "Esh he has no family and wants his kids to have his name. Maybe he\u2019s insecure about his connection with his kids and lack of family. It sounds like he\u2019s reacting emotionally and the name thing is just an expression of his feelings.  \n\nSounds like this convo took a left and it didn\u2019t have to, have another conversation with him about it. I feel like this is deeper and you both could have handled it better.", "ESH. \n\nAt least where I live, if you can't agree which last name the child gets, you hyphenate it. You may just have to do that with your husband's name and yours.", "NTA But\u2026logistically speaking if your husband were to travel with a child with a different last name than his, it would cause more questions than if you did it.

This is the kind of thing that needs to be discussed in the dating stage.\n\nNAH", "I think you both are kind of AHs. You for not discussing the last name of the baby and him for assuming the kid should take the fathers name automatically. How about you combine the names for the child or hyphenate.

I'm in the UK and every child I know takes their mothers name, unless both parents have the same name, at which point baby would have the joint name (usually the fathers as the woman usually takes the man's name, but not always) I don't know anyone who has their fathers name but not their mothers u less their parents got divorced and mother went back to maiden name.  \nChatGPT  \nThe statement you provided seems to be discussing naming conventions, specifically the practice of children taking their mother's surname. Naming conventions can vary widely based on cultural, regional, and individual family preferences.  \nIn many parts of the Western world, including the UK, the traditional practice has been for children to take their father's surname. However, there are several points to consider:  \nChanging Traditions: Over the past few decades, there has been a shift in some Western societies, including parts of the UK, where couples are choosing non-traditional naming conventions. This can include children taking the mother's surname, both parents hyphenating their surnames, or even creating a new combined surname.  \nIndividual Choices: Naming conventions can be deeply personal, and families might choose a particular surname for their children based on various reasons, including cultural or familial significance, personal beliefs, or simply how the name sounds.  \nLegal Considerations: In some countries or regions, there might be legal guidelines or traditions regarding naming conventions. For example, in some cultures, it's customary for children to take both parents' surnames, either hyphenated or as two separate names.  \nDiverse Experiences: It's essential to recognize that individual experiences can vary widely. While one person might know many children who take their mother's surname, another person might have a different experience based on their community, cultural background, or social circle.  \nDivorce and Remarriage: In cases of divorce or remarriage, naming conventions can become more complex. A child might retain the surname they were given at birth, or there might be a decision to change the child's surname to match a custodial parent or new family unit.  \nIn conclusion, while traditional naming conventions in many parts of the Western world have leaned towards children taking their father's surname, there is a growing trend of more diverse and flexible naming practices. The UK, like many countries, has seen a shift in these traditions, and individual choices can vary widely based on a range of factors.", "This one threw me for a loop, but I find myself not only seeing where you're coming from, I also agree. \n\nToday is weird, someone yelling on the Internet actually changed my mind.", "It's actually only tradition in certain cultures \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nAnd frankly it's 2023 tradions and societal expectations change.

Easy and simple.", "NTA. However I will offer a possibility to think of: There's also the possibility that after everything he's been through perhaps subconsciously he wants to associate something good with his name and create/build something beautiful from it. I could be wrong. But it was a thought. For example: I've never been married, but a few rare times I gave it some thought as a maybe someday type of thing, I also thought about last names and how I (born female) would want to carry on my last name even though that's typically a male thing to do - and I realized that (for me) it was because I wanted to leave all the bad things behind (I didn't have the most wonderful childhood, although Mom tried her best, she could only do so much, especially when I wasn't in her sight because I was on visitation) and I would want to or want to try to create or make something good with what I've been given. It's also in that same vein that if I ever have children (I won't) I want to give them part of my deceased Mother's name: I want to hold on to something good and bring it with me even if I have to create it. So if I ever had a girl she would likely have my Mother's first name but if I had a boy he would be given my Mother's middle name. Your husband probably doesn't have the same thought about names but it's also possible that he does. It's also possible that he has the typical worry about being emasculated. However part of the reason for carrying on a name is to carry on or create a legacy, and that usually requires good input, and quite honestly donating sperm to the cause isn't quite valued the same towards building/creating as passing something down to the next generation is. So while you have something you want to pass down (a name), so does he, although you may have different reasons for it.", "This probably should have been discussed before you two got married  Maybe go with the hyphenated name or if you have more than one, give one moms last name and one dads last name.

His comment about it being disrespectful not to have his last name is absolutely wrong. Many children take their mothers last name.
