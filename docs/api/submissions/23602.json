I know that sometimes siblings, especially sisters, tend to copy each other, but this has gone too far. \n\n   When we were younger, my friends used to think we were twins because of how much she copied me. Every shirt I had, she had. Every friend I had, she had. Every BOYFRIEND I had, SHE HAD!!! We never got along, and shes been keeping this up for my whole life!\n\n   (Before I get to the rest of the story, I just want to mention that she has never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses that could cause her behavior, it's most likely just jealousy.)\n\n   I thought she had stopped when my boyfriend (now husband) proposed to me when I turned 25. She did for a while, until the day of the wedding.\n\n   I planned for my big day to go perfectly; who wouldn't? I was excited and so happy to finally be married to the love of my life. We allowed guests to wear whatever they wanted, as long as it wasn't white. Well, turns out my sister \"didn't see it on the invitation\" and showed up in a long, white, elegant wedding dress. \n\n   I asked her to go change before the ceremony started but she refused. I didn't want to argue and ruin my mood, so I asked our mom if she could get Kylie to change. \n\n   The ceremony went perfectly and I wish I could relive it. But I won't spare the details or this post would be too long. Immediately after, I went to go look for my sister to see if she changed. She didn't; and it turns out she was talking to my husband in a corner of the room. How sketchy is that?? I asked Kylie why she didn't change and she said that she didn't feel like it. I was really trying to compose myself since this was supposed to be my special day, but I couldn't. I brang her to one of the changing rooms of the hall and told her to change into the dress I was going to wear when I left. It was a simple red dress that she had no reason to deny wearing. I left her alone to change and went back to my husband.\n\n   This whole part is really a blur so spare me if I don't include many details. My husband tells me what they were talking about. He said something about her saying that they could get together and I don't have to know but he was telling her to stop. All I can remember after that is security kicking her out of the hall. My parents and few guests were mad at me but I told them they could join Kylie outside if they wanted. The rest of the night was perfect and I don't regret my decision, but I've received a bunch of angry dms from my sister and her friends and few guests who are mad at me for kicking my own family out of the wedding! I don't think they understand how many times she's done this, but the fact that she had the nerve to do it on my WEDDING DAY???? AITA??\n\n   I'm not sure where to squeeze this into, so I'm leaving it back here. My sister has a boyfriend and they've been together for 3 years when this occured.\n\nEDIT: Messaged all guests who attended the wedding and whoever got involved this drama the truth. People are 50/50, but my parents believe my husband and I.

Definitely go no contact", "NTA, block the sister, tell your sisters bf of what happened and refuse to apologize. Anyone who is upset at you for kicking your wedding dress wearing attempted husband seducing sister is a weirdo.", "NTA\n\nSimple response to anyone on your sisters side of this that reaches out:\n\n*thank you for your concern regarding MY reception.  While I\u2019m not sure what you may have been told, the truth is I feel no regret for having my sister removed after she A) showed up on what could only be described as a wedding dress, B) refused to change into the *much more appropriate for a guest\u2019 dress she was offered and C) attempted to convince he groom to run away with her even after he repeatedly asked her to stop.*\n\nIf they continue to defend your sister tell them \u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, it was nice knowing you\u2019.  Then block and continue to live your best life with your new husband.", "NTA. The best thing to do is cut your sister out of your life and tell everybody why. Don\u2019t even provide the entire backstory (they will accuse you of being petty/say you should let it go) just tell everyone it\u2019s because she tried to fuck your husband and you know this for a fact. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t provide any other information or history. If people here that, there\u2019s nothing they can say back. Just get that information out there so that people know what the deal is. If you try to maintain a relationship with your sister after this, you\u2019re just asking for more drama.", "NTA.  Make sure she's never ever alone with your husband again. Certainly don't let her ever come over to where you live. I can just see you being away on a trip, her getting into your place, crawling into bed with him and having sex with him when he's half asleep before he realizes it's not you. Of course getting pregnant in the process. It all sounds like a very bad Lifetime movie", "She definitely needs therapy, your sister sounds disgusting.

Please tell those who message you that your sister tried to have sex with your husband on your wedding day. Anyone who disagrees with what you did should also be cut from your life. I'd immediately blacklist her from my entire life.", "Your sister wore a wedding dress to your wedding and then propsitioned the groom before the cake was even cut.

Why hide it.", "Based on the 4 year age gap with her sister being the elder, I kinda suspect this person doesn't exist.\n\nThinking it through, what grade 8 is going to want to wear the same clothes as a grade 4?

I\u2019m guessing the next thing that happens is she tells everyone your husband was propositioning her.", "please please please put her on blast.", "Honestly, at this point , you should put her on blast. She and your parents obviously aren't keeping it quiet and are siccing their flying monkeys at you, so why should you just take it? What is your silence protecting, because it isn't you and your husband. Drop the bomb and walk away.", "I\u2019m not usually one to encourage putting people on blast, but this is certainly a situation that calls for it. SM post: \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving a lot of nasty calls and messages regarding the fact that we had my sister escorted out of our wedding reception. Since I don\u2019t have the time to respond to everyone, I\u2019ll just say that after my sister wore a wedding dress, refused to change, then tried to convince my husband to begin an affair with her, I believe we were justified in having her removed. If you don\u2019t find those acceptable reasons, just go ahead and remove yourself from our lives, because we refuse to defend ourselves any further.\u201d", "If I do that, I'm afraid she might find a way to turn the situation onto me and say I'm lying. Is it worth that risk??", "What risk? You're already paying it.

Sibling rivalry, attempted infidelity, wedding-day drama, white dress stuff? \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself believe this is real.", "Girl.............\n\nThe fact that no one dumped a drink on her dress or forced her to change tells me everything I need to know about your so called family. Cut them all out of your life, they won't even defend you from your sister on you f-ing wedding day?!?! Clearly IF sis gets married instead of trying to steal your man you need to wear your wedding dress there, it'll be a tradition and you can finally copy big sis yourself. Nta, ignore the haters and enjoy the new hubby.", "NTA. Read about personality disorders. Sounds like your sister could be histrionic or narcissistic or worse.

I\u2019m sorry but, Your sister is fucked.", "NTA!", "NTA, your sister needs a therapist. I would go no contact with her and anyone who defends her actions.

This includes your sister.", "NTA", "NTA. You may love your sister, but she is obviously toxic and it is damaging you. Society has created this notion that you have to love and stick by your family no matter what, but that isn't true. You don't owe anyone, including your family. You really need to take a step back and really think about your relationship with your sister. If she is willing to show up to your wedding and try to ruin it, then obviously she doesn't love you. You should seriously consider going either low contact or no contact with her. You shouldn't have to spend you life looking over your shoulder for every disaster your sister creates. Also think about your husband. Imagine how uncomfortable she makes him feel, he shouldn't have to put up with that either.", "Didn\u2019t you post about sleeping with your boss last week?

So kinda not having any sympathy for you", "I'm going with YTA.\n\nLooking at her post history as of the time I'm posting this, she has also made a post in TIFU (today I f'd up) that says she slept with her boss today - the same week she got married and was devastated by her sister propositioning her husband minutes after she got married.\n\nShe is either TA because she's here karma farming with fiction or because she cheated on her husband the week she got married.", "Or had a red wine \u201caccident\u201d on her dress", "That was today, and I didn't remove it because it never posted??

Zero sympathy", "Don't let her control the narrative, tell them EXACTLY what happened, even better if your husband does.", "INFO what about the boss you said you were sleeping with on TIFU?", "Tell them what she did. If she\u2019s embarrassed or ridiculed, she brought it on herself by doing it.", "she seems pretty down to turn em all against you.", "Not to be totally off base here... but how can you still possibly love someone who a every stage of life (including your wedding day) has made it their mission to hurt you by destroying all of your relationships? It's so incredibly sad that you value yourself so little.", "Tell them about you banging your boss while you\u2019re at it", "Different sizes in clothing exist. Also, my husband is only a year older than me and she still went after him.", "Yeah this post is weird. #skeptical", "So you think it makes sense to assume that OP only dated people exactly the same age as her? Not every 16yr old only dates other 16yr olds. Moreover, OP doesn\u2019t even say what age the boyfriend stealing happened.\n\nMaybe it needs a bit more \u201cthinking through\u201d?", "Credit goes to u/j_birdddd who tipped me off in a discussion below another comment where I was giving reasons why I was skeptical of the story (before she posted in TIFU).", "It's entirely possible your story is real, yes, and it sounds like an awful situation for you if it's true.\n\nBut the skepticism comes from the series of statements like: \"Every friend you had, she had. Every boyfriend you had, she had.\"\n\nYou seem to have misunderstood my point, though. Kids style choices and what's popular are quite different between gr 5 and gr 9. I realize it's possible to buy different sizes. I also wasn't referring to your present husband. A 4yr age gap is trivial in your late 20s. But for her to have dated all your boyfriends, a 4 year age gap, especially with the girl being older, is massive in high school and even into your early 20s. It's difficult to imagine a grade 12 girl who dreams about taking the grade 9 boy her sister dated to prom. These details make it harder to believe the story.\n\nDon't worry about it, though. It's Reddit and random strangers' opinions about whether your story is true or not has zero bearing on your reality.", "As I say, I am simply expressing my skepticism, not campaigning for you to agree.\n\nShe's 26, has been engaged for a year, so likely dating her husband since she was 24.\n\n\"Every boyfriend\" implies several, so let's say 3. You are right that she could have started dating at 20 and dated guys who were a bit older than her. You are 1000% welcome to see nothing implausible about this story. I choose to give more weight to my skepticism in this case. Too many details don't fit well for me, but again, I'm just a random Koala on the internet and my opinion has no bearing on her reality. OP is getting lots of reinforcement and sympathy for her post. My skepticism is a mere footnote.", "Honestly there is nothing to lose at this point, anyone that sides with your sister after that was never going to be worth the trouble either way. Honestly I would be ecstatic at the chance to really weed out the snakes, you\u2019ve just been handed a lawn mower, use it.", "they're doing that right now - they think you're the asshole because as far as they believe, you just had a tantrum for no reason. there's literally no risk because she's already doing this to you. are there any pictures of her in the dress? I'd post an explanation with that, if you can find one.", "Could she possibly turn it on you by telling your husband you fucked your boss? \ud83d\ude31", "make your husband talk to her with hidden voice recorder. That way you'll have the evidence to back you up so she can't lie to others and turn them against you when you've been a victim all your life.", "I get what you mean.", "She also made another post, a TIFU by sleeping with her boss an hour ago?! Idk, something seems weird", "Yeah, lol. I love how I'm getting downvoted for gently expressing skepticism \ud83d\ude05", "Lol. Just learned what TIFU means \ud83d\ude02.\n\nSo yeah, just married, hurt by her sister propositioning her new husband at the wedding, and making a bad life choice by sleeping with the boss the same week as she gets married.", "INFO: Was this before or after [you fucked your boss?](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15eyghi/tifu_by_fucking_my_boss/)", "Um, brang isn't a word.
