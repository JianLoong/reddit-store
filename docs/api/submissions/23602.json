I know that sometimes siblings, especially sisters, tend to copy each other, but this has gone too far. \n\n   When we were younger, my friends used to think we were twins because of how much she copied me. Every shirt I had, she had. Every friend I had, she had. Every BOYFRIEND I had, SHE HAD!!! We never got along, and shes been keeping this up for my whole life!\n\n   (Before I get to the rest of the story, I just want to mention that she has never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses that could cause her behavior, it's most likely just jealousy.)\n\n   I thought she had stopped when my boyfriend (now husband) proposed to me when I turned 25. She did for a while, until the day of the wedding.\n\n   I planned for my big day to go perfectly; who wouldn't? I was excited and so happy to finally be married to the love of my life. We allowed guests to wear whatever they wanted, as long as it wasn't white. Well, turns out my sister \"didn't see it on the invitation\" and showed up in a long, white, elegant wedding dress. \n\n   I asked her to go change before the ceremony started but she refused. I didn't want to argue and ruin my mood, so I asked our mom if she could get Kylie to change. \n\n   The ceremony went perfectly and I wish I could relive it. But I won't spare the details or this post would be too long. Immediately after, I went to go look for my sister to see if she changed. She didn't; and it turns out she was talking to my husband in a corner of the room. How sketchy is that?? I asked Kylie why she didn't change and she said that she didn't feel like it. I was really trying to compose myself since this was supposed to be my special day, but I couldn't. I brang her to one of the changing rooms of the hall and told her to change into the dress I was going to wear when I left. It was a simple red dress that she had no reason to deny wearing. I left her alone to change and went back to my husband.\n\n   This whole part is really a blur so spare me if I don't include many details. My husband tells me what they were talking about. He said something about her saying that they could get together and I don't have to know but he was telling her to stop. All I can remember after that is security kicking her out of the hall. My parents and few guests were mad at me but I told them they could join Kylie outside if they wanted. The rest of the night was perfect and I don't regret my decision, but I've received a bunch of angry dms from my sister and her friends and few guests who are mad at me for kicking my own family out of the wedding! I don't think they understand how many times she's done this, but the fact that she had the nerve to do it on my WEDDING DAY???? AITA??\n\n   I'm not sure where to squeeze this into, so I'm leaving it back here. My sister has a boyfriend and they've been together for 3 years when this occured.", "created_utc": 1690848108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ewf95/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Definitely go no contact", "NTA, block the sister, tell your sisters bf of what happened and refuse to apologize. Anyone who is upset at you for kicking your wedding dress wearing attempted husband seducing sister is a weirdo.", "NTA\n\nSimple response to anyone on your sisters side of this that reaches out:\n\n*thank you for your concern regarding MY reception.  While I\u2019m not sure what you may have been told, the truth is I feel no regret for having my sister removed after she A) showed up on what could only be described as a wedding dress, B) refused to change into the *much more appropriate for a guest\u2019 dress she was offered and C) attempted to convince he groom to run away with her even after he repeatedly asked her to stop.*\n\nIf they continue to defend your sister tell them \u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, it was nice knowing you\u2019.  Then block and continue to live your best life with your new husband.", "NTA. The best thing to do is cut your sister out of your life and tell everybody why. Don\u2019t even provide the entire backstory (they will accuse you of being petty/say you should let it go) just tell everyone it\u2019s because she tried to fuck your husband and you know this for a fact. That\u2019s it. Don\u2019t provide any other information or history. If people here that, there\u2019s nothing they can say back. Just get that information out there so that people know what the deal is. If you try to maintain a relationship with your sister after this, you\u2019re just asking for more drama.", "NTA.  Make sure she's never ever alone with your husband again. Certainly don't let her ever come over to where you live. I can just see you being away on a trip, her getting into your place, crawling into bed with him and having sex with him when he's half asleep before he realizes it's not you. Of course getting pregnant in the process. It all sounds like a very bad Lifetime movie", "She definitely needs therapy, your sister sounds disgusting. Knowing all the background I\u2019d have probably kicked her out since I saw her wearing white but for the people that matters to you, like your parents, explain them what happen and the rest and your sister BLOCK\n\nCompletely NTA", "Your sister really needs to get her shit together.\n\nYou're NTA", "Lol nta versus a million. She deserves way more than just being kicked out.\nAnd if I were your friend I would make sure to ruin her dress\u2026 the nerve", "NTA. You laster longer than most, lots if people would have kicked her out after she showed up in a long white dress.", "NTA!! she\u2019s terrible", "I can\u2019t even believe people like this exist. \n\nNTA.", "Dang, that's cold on your sisters part.  Worse than even things my sister has done.  NTAH and I'd cut her out of your life indefinitely...", "NTA", "Your wedding day you call the shots. The rest of the family members who didn\u2019t agree with you and are hounding you are TAS. The bigger AH is your toxic sister.", "Are the people mad at your aware she was asking your now husband to fuck her at the wedding or..", "NTA - Removing her from the festivities was the correct decision. Ignore the noise. They did not live your life nor have all the details. No sound person would view her proposition as 'okay'. Enjoy your new life!", "NTA. Please tell those who message you that your sister tried to have sex with your husband on your wedding day. Anyone who disagrees with what you did should also be cut from your life. I'd immediately blacklist her from my entire life.", "Your sister wore a wedding dress to your wedding and then propsitioned the groom before the cake was even cut. If your relatives don't think that was enough of a reason to remove her from the place, what would they think should qualify? I'm really curious to know!\n\nNTA", "Tell her boyfriend, her friends and your family what shit she pulled. This is grounds for a full cut off. NTA.", "Your sister sounds profoundly mentally ill -", "NTA, and you have the patience of a Saint, because I know a lot of women who would've given the sister a black eye for pulling shit like that.", "Wow not the nta you should really all of them and plz update of you do", "NTA", "Bloody hell NTA! \nCut her off, go NC. She\u2019s not going to stop just because you\u2019re now married, if anything she\u2019s going to try harder. And if anyone asks why you\u2019ve gone NC, tell them the truth about the wedding day. Get her out of your life, she\u2019s not worth the stress. Good luck OP!", "NTA. I\u2019d tell everyone who asks exactly what happened, including her bf. Why hide it.", "Based on the 4 year age gap with her sister being the elder, I kinda suspect this person doesn't exist.\n\nThinking it through, what grade 8 is going to want to wear the same clothes as a grade 4? What girl at 20 wants to date a 16 year old boy? It doesn't make sense.\n\nIt's totally possible this is real, of course because people are strange, but I doubt it.", "I never told anyone because I love my sister and I don't want to turn everyone against her. I think I'm only going to tell our parents and her boyfriend so they're aware.", "By keeping it a secret, you are asking for trouble. I\u2019m guessing the next thing that happens is she tells everyone your husband was propositioning her.", "please please please put her on blast.", "Honestly, at this point , you should put her on blast. She and your parents obviously aren't keeping it quiet and are siccing their flying monkeys at you, so why should you just take it? What is your silence protecting, because it isn't you and your husband. Drop the bomb and walk away.", "I\u2019m not usually one to encourage putting people on blast, but this is certainly a situation that calls for it. SM post: \u201cI\u2019ve been receiving a lot of nasty calls and messages regarding the fact that we had my sister escorted out of our wedding reception. Since I don\u2019t have the time to respond to everyone, I\u2019ll just say that after my sister wore a wedding dress, refused to change, then tried to convince my husband to begin an affair with her, I believe we were justified in having her removed. If you don\u2019t find those acceptable reasons, just go ahead and remove yourself from our lives, because we refuse to defend ourselves any further.\u201d", "If I do that, I'm afraid she might find a way to turn the situation onto me and say I'm lying. Is it worth that risk??", "What risk? You're already paying it. People already think you're the asshole because you are leaving the story untold. \n\nAlso, the fact that your sister showed up in a long white gown---which I'm assuming everyone saw---is external proof that she was willing to upstage you.", "Your husband can back you on it"]}
