His long term domestic partner called to tell me he was on the way to the hospital but was certainly deceased. Her health was poor and she died the same day, which I didn\u2019t learn until much later when she was unreachable. I couldn\u2019t get into the house and had to force the door. The dog was obviously orphaned. A cockapoo, small, easy, mild, 9 years old, no problems. I took the liberty of bringing her home.\n\nMy wife was a little shy of furious but very very angry. She said I should have asked her, that \u201cit\u2019s my house too!\u201d I wouldn\u2019t contradict that, but under the circumstances I was certain that she would understand. I was very hurt by her insensitivity. Obviously I was somewhat stunned by grief and I couldn\u2019t imagine anything other than adopting the dog myself. We own our home and already have two cats. As I said, she\u2019s a low maintenance dog. \n\nMy wife persists to refuse to walk the dog saying \u201cshe\u2019s not my dog\u201d. Occasionally she uses this incident to demonstrate how I\u2019m a bully in the relationship. I have a hard time seeing in objectively. I\u2019m over the grief and I just want some thoughts, so let me know.\n\nClarification: it\u2019s not really about expecting my wife to do dog chores. I just wanted to have an example of the strange dynamic. Like in two years she has never walked the dog. Not once. I have been bold enough to suggest it on occasion, such as when we had evening plans and she was already home but I was going to need to come home versus meeting up, or if I wasn\u2019t feeling great. I\u2019ve been surprised when she holds that boundary. I\u2019m guessing she would walk her if I was incapacitated (she\u2019d be pissed though). She doesn\u2019t actually despise the dog. She chooses to give her treats and things. It\u2019s not really about me expecting my wife to take care of the dog.\n\nTruly, still feel I had no excuse not to take the dog. It was a duty I welcomed. My wife didn\u2019t want it but that wasn\u2019t a suitable reason to defy my conscience. I\u2019m majority YTA so far. I\u2019m certainly not impartial. So be it. I wanted the dog then also I couldn\u2019t imagine being the son who send the dog to strangers or the humane society. Most of the comments have been kind enough.

Sounds like she\u2019s using it as scapegoat to not address the real reasons she might be frustrated. You have cats so obviously it\u2019s not a case of wanting a pet free home, and a low maintenance dog really doesn\u2019t require much work.

I might not have been super happy about it, but the situation definitely doesn't call for the level of toxicity she's showing. A mentally stable person in her situation would probably ask for you to adopt the dog away as soon as possible, but from your description she wen't ballistic right away which was totally uncalled for considering the situation.  \n\n\nWhile you however can't expect her to take the dog for walks or whatever, her attitude is obviously hugely assholish and I can just assume that she regularly uses that kind of passive aggressiveness as a mean of control in your relationship, and not just regarding the dog?", "Screw the masses!

I know you said you\u2019re over the grief, but I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. You definitely should have talked to your wife first before adopting the dog, but if I was someone\u2019s long term partner like that, I\u2019d understand them making some rash decisions out of grief after a highly stressful situation like that. And especially if the dog wasn\u2019t causing any problems, I\u2019d just get over it. Sometimes life puts problems on our plate, and we aren\u2019t in the best place to deal with them; any partner should understand that.

Your wife needs to grow up and finally quit being a \"B\" about a dog YOU DIDNT WANT but felt compelled by  circumstances that affected your heart to bring home! This wasn't a NEW pet or just any old pet being given away..this was your deceased FATHERS companion!!!

Yes an animal is something that should generally be a 2 yes 1 no situation but damn does she have a heart at all. What did she want you to do? Put your dead dads dog in a shelter or leave it alone unattended in their home till someone else found him. Let\u2019s be straight bringing a pet home unannounced is usually never okay except in this one extreme circumstance because honestly these are extenuating circumstances. And honestly she\u2019s just being petty and spiteful at this point refusing to help walk the dog once I a while (every few months when op is sick or doesn\u2019t want to make a trip home just to walk the dog so he can then take said wife out to dinner). It\u2019s been 2 years and she\u2019s still holding a grudge she never should have had. She should have been there supporting you completely when this all happened, but instead she chose to get her panties in a twist over something that should have been insignificant given the circumstances.

The other options were to let the dog sit in an empty house to starve and otherwise be neglected. Dropping the dog off at a shelter would likely be a death sentence.

I agree that your wife has no responsibility to the dog and that you should be doing 99% of all dog care but come on people a marriage is a partnership, sometimes you have to compromise.  I do things that i dont like occsssionally for my husband cuz thats just what you do.  Its seems like  she is really holding a grudge on this one and still doesnt have empathy/understanding for what you were going through when your dad died which makes her a bit of an AH in my opinion.", "NTA Personally I would think about rehoming, you and the dog deserve a peaceful life. Seriously, please don\u2019t ask your wife to care for the dog in any way, she isn\u2019t a dog person and that\u2019s fine, but dogs have feelings, this poor dog lost both of its humans suddenly and that\u2019s traumatic. Having her do something she doesn\u2019t want to do is only going to be bad for the dog", "NTA... what did she expect you to do - take Fido to the pound?", "NTA you adopted a dog that I'm assuming your father loved and did it in a way to show your love for your father, be kind to an animal in need, and honor him. What your wife is doing 2 years in by refusing to help at all sounds like a selfish game. I don't know what point she's trying to prove but she's in the wrong.", "NTA. This was an extreme circumstance. I reacued a dog and then a year or so later became physically disabled. My husband did not want the dog. He still does not want the dog. I am now physically incapable of caring for the dog. He has totally taken over. He complains but admits he loves him but still doesn't want the dog. But rehoming a 10 to 12 year old pomeranian isn't easy and might be cruel. So the dog is here. Wife doesn't have to walk the dog but I'd go malicious compliance and not help her on things you don't want and didn't agree to.", "NTA because your wife was being unreasonable in an extraordinary grief laden situation. Who does that? Who castigates against their partner the person that they say they love for bringing home an orphaned abandoned probably starving and traumatized pet? Then on top of everything else she has the nerve to call you a bully which is so outsized wrong on so many levels. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss and the resistance to trying to adjust to a very rapidly evolving situation. There is no way I would leave an animal in distress like that. I question your wife's heart for you and for others.", "Ignore the people who say anything except NTA.  The idea that there are people who would condemn a pup to abandonment is just so sad.  You are a good person.  Don't let that wife of yours convince you otherwise.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA and she isnt an AH either perse! This is OP's dads dog..... not just any dog that he just randomly decided to adopt. Sometimes unexpected things happen and situations pop out of nowhere.

It is a living part of his father. It is something that his father left behind. Of course OP wants to hold onto that. This is a living breathing creature. They have feelings too.

OP isn't asking their wife to take care of the dog for them. \n\nOP isn't upset at their wife for refusing to do so.\n\nIt takes a cold heartless person to consider OP to be an asshole. I mean seriously, you must have no empathy whatsoever. \n\nOh you have empathy for the wife? What if the tables were turned then? What if she suddenly had to adopt a new pet because her parents died? Would she then be the AH?\n\nSeriously. It honestly disgusts me, the complete lack of compassion you people have shown here today. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.", "No, it should still be a discussion. He might insist on it, but he still should have discussed it with her.", "Is it an acceptable reason for keeping it for two years despite his wife\u2019s protests?", "How does the wife suck?", "It's very unlikely that a 9-year-old dog would be \"rehomed\" through a shelter. It's more likely that the dog would be killed.", "This is not about bringing the dog home, but keeping it two years later and expecting wife to take care of it", "Yeah, there are a lot of things not being said here. It's possible OP is just a normal dude who has blunders like this only once or twice and the \"bully\" comment is unnecessary. It's also possible he consistently oversteps boundaries and assumes if he's okay with something his wife must be too despite never talking about it. It's possible this dog is a well behaved little angel, and it's also possible the dog is aggressive towards the cats and makes messes in the house she is sick of dealing with.\n\nThe fact she is bringing it up over and over more than 2 years later shows there are bigger issues in the relationship than the dog. I can see why OP did what he did. Older animals don't fare well in shelters and often are put down. It can be extremely hard to simply ship off your loved one's beloved pet to a shelter while you are in the midst of grief. But for the love of god if someone is your spouse--your life partner--you gotta sit down and talk about it.  Sometimes your lives really genuinely cannot accommodate a dog as much as you want it to and you can sometimes be blind to those issues.\n\nESH unless this is a better of behavior from him, then Y T A. I recommend couples therapy to get to the root issue and properly address it but this is a serious crack in the foundation if she's consistently calling you a bully in the relationship\n\nedit: Situations like this is also why I think everyone should have a plan of what happens to their animals if they die. I know no one likes thinking about it but even if you're not that old it's never bad to have a plan in place. Have a list of people you've talked to, friends/family who could take it in. Have money set aside for your pet if possible for them moving/their needs. They're living creatures we may very well leave behind so it's not wrong to have a plan to potentially fall back on.", "He's asked her to walk the dog a few times when it would either benefit her or he's sick.

It's such an asshole move for him to just expect his wife to do it when she never agreed in the first place.\n\nA lot of people with kids and busy schedules vet a ton of babysitters in the area who are willing to do short notice, and then if they ever need a short notice babysitter, they call down their list until they find someone who is free. He can do the same with dog sitters I bet.

Is there a pattern of you finding ways of trumping her feelings that led to her reaction, or was she being an AH?\n\nBut two years is a shockingly long time for a couple to be dug into their positions and not try to problem-solve.  In two years you could have found a loving home -- a 100% loving home, not just 50% -- for the dog.  \"Sending her off to strangers or the humane society\" is a false dichotomy of your own making. Why not prioritize your wife's feelings this way?\n\nYet, according to you, your wife can treat the dog nicely  -- does that mean that she sometimes appreciates the dog's company?  In that case, spending 2 years holding your impulsive decision over your head is just dysfunctional. \n\nShe says you act like a bully. Either you do, or she's projecting because she does, or your relationship has devolved into one of perpetual score-keeping.  In any case, get thee to therapy!", "NTA you dint abandon a dog to die what kind of sick human does that?  Your wife needs help professionally if she thinks you shouldn't have stepped in.", "NTA. Not all of life can be planned. If wife cares about her spouse she should be able to roll a bit. Besides, what kind of person doesn\u2019t like an orphaned dog?", "NTA. Your wife didn't want the dog but circumstances are what they are. \n\nHow could she expect you to lose a parent and then send the parent's dog to the pound, if there is an easy enough way for that not to happen? Did she want you to be guilt-ridden for the rest of your life? She sounds lovely.\n\nShe should show a little grace instead of making 15-odd pounds of low-maintenance dog the reason for a 2+ year dispute.", "Also wanting to address this line from OP's post:\n\n>how I\u2019m a bully in the relationship\n\nOP is a bully. Intellectual bullies (which OP sounds like) tend to act in a way that forces people to come up with \"valid reasons\" why they are incorrect. But these \"valid reasons\" are only accepted by them, and not a consensus that both parties come to agreement on.  Often times an intellectual bully will require a detailed, thought out counterpoint with PowerPoint presentations that spans 10+ minutes (I am only *kind of* exaggerating). Intellectual bullies ignore the \"no means no\" mantra.\n\nThe fact that OP still thinks this line: \"My wife didn\u2019t want it but that wasn\u2019t a suitable reason to defy my conscience\", is a clear indication that he is an intellectual bully.", "It's only nta if you answer the questions in the title. Everything else is YTA. OP admits caring more about his own choices than his wife's input in the edit and his post actually has no point other than an effort to complain about his wife and paint her in a bad life. There is no conflict other than him trying to guilt her into his way.", "I'm sorry but an animal is not like porcelain or silverware or linens. It's more like a child and either both of you are on board or you're not. And at that point the person wanting the animal needs to ask of they want the animal more than they want their marriage. If that's the case then the divorce proceedings should go forth. \n\nYou don't make a life decision that may last a decade of not longer unilaterally and without your partner's support. They're called a life partner not a rug you can walk all over.", ">for me two things stuck out as missing missing reasons  \n>  \n><<*Occasionally she uses this incident to demonstrate how I\u2019m a bully in the relationship*.>>  and  \n>  \n><<*My wife didn\u2019t want it but that wasn\u2019t a suitable reason to defy my conscience*\\>>  OP's use of the word Defy.    \n>  \n>Even if he means it as he wouldn't defy his conscience and not that he wouldn't allow his wife to defy his conscience, it's a telling word choice.", "Vet bills can add up fast for elderly pets, so unless the dog remains immaculately healthy until it dies, they're going to have to make some financial decisions. If it comes down with a terminal illness, he may well want to spend the money to keep it alive by any means possible.", "I came here to say this too... My cat creates more mess than my two large dogs combined. She sheds more than them both, makes a mess of her food and water, tracks litter all over the house (it got so bad we switched to wood pellets, and somehow shes still getting those into our bedroom), and she launches litter around the room her boxes are in. The dogs leave us with some muddy floors if the weather is  bad, I would take that over the mess from the cat we're constantly cleaning any day! (I love my cat dont get me wrong, but that 9 pound gremlin is the messiest being in my house!)", "It doesn't matter if they're aggressive or not. The dog is unwanted and OP is trying to bully his wife on the internet and hoping we shame her into accepting the dog. \n\nThe poster you're referring to is posting specifically to someone who had experience with a violent dog.", "I think that lots of people are just speculating Its OK at any time to not want a pet in your home? I mean as much as I love being a pet owner, I don't do cats and no one  in my life can expect me to live with one. (They make me itch.)\ud83d\ude02", "This is more than fair, IMO. If my husband adopted a white rat, I'd be gone before his car engine cooled off. Some things are a hard NO! for me.", "She isn't bullying the dog. She is refusing to walk it. She feeds it treats and pats it. Walking it is something she doesn't want to do. I would feel the same. She didn't sign up to walk with a dog and pick up their poop. She has a boundary and he needs to accept that boundary.", "Well maybe he shouldn't have made a unilateral decision to take in an animal (that he knows she doesn't like/is scared of) to care for for the next 10 years first.\n\n>he should be able to ask for help from his wife.\n\nYeah it's almost like dogs are high maintenance animals and that's something that should've been taken into consideration.\n\nIf this was a temporary thing while they find it a new home I would feel differently, but it's been two years and unfortunately it seems the dog is staying.", "There's a difference in bringing it home first because it has no one else AND THEN discussing options of keeping it long term and rehoming it and bringing it home and DEMANDING to keep the dog and wanting her to just deal with that decision whether she likes it or not and then expecting her to take care of the dog she did not want.", "It really, really does. Half the commentators are acting like the wife's demanding that the dog be thrown in a pound, when absolutely nothing OP said even implied that, OP is just butthurt that his wife \\*dares\\* to have her own  opinion and \"persistently\" refuses to walk the dog for him.", "Not just this, but she literally had no say in it living in her house.", "I don't like dogs at all. I'm not afraid of them, but I they make me uncomfortable and I have to immediately wash my hands off I pretty them because I hate the way the oil on their fur makes me feel.\n\nI like cats but I can accept some people don't. Dog people seem completely incapable of understanding that some people just don't like dogs.", "\"oh for sure, we can totally host the holiday this year!!\" While he has nothing to do with the hosting except maybe setting up tables and chairs.", "I mean. It's a middle aged to elderly dog. Being in ill health, including puking and incontinence are right around the corner", "It\u2019s possible OP is a bully in other ways in their relationship and it\u2019s not mentioned in this post, and the dog is just one example.", "Animal ppl are so obnoxious. Let me count the ways I'd ignore that dogs existence. How dare you bring a life and responsibility to her doorstep unbidden and be upset she doesn't simply acquiesce. YTA", "This. I\u2019m not sure why people are suggesting that OP should\u2019ve just surrendered his dad\u2019s dog and calling him an asshole for refusing to do so. I\u2019m more of a cat person but I would never not take in my parents\u2019 dog and my SO would do the same. Animals are living, breathing, sentient beings with feelings and connections, not pieces of furniture.", "Yep, I get that most of the dog care should fall to OP but refusing to do anything to care for the dog out of spite is heartless.", "No he is not expecting his wife to care for the dog. He simply asked for help when he couldn't make it on time. What kind of person refuses to help with a simple request like that and 2 years later still throwing it in his face? Someone sounds spoiled, intitled and bratty and it isn't OP.", "\"He's not asking her to care for the dog, just do all the tasks involved in caring for the dog!\"", "He said that she would if he were truly incapacitated though. She just won't be involved if he is capable of it.", "His wife is not unkind just indifferent. You do not rehome an 11 year old dog (9+2). just because someone is pissed at their husband.", "Then you should go. He deserves way better than you.", "It is literally a pet. It is a living sentient PET.", "It doesn't have to be festering resentment, but it can be a hard boundary. He went against her wishes and took in the dog. She is living with all of the expenses and messes that come with having a dog in your house, but she has made it clear that it is NOT her dog and she wants no part in its care.", "You rehome a dog when there are people on the home don\u2019t want anything to do with it and the person who took the dog in doesn\u2019t want to be 100% responsible for it.  From the sound of it OP never bothered to check if another relative wanted it.", "yeah, like... what exactly is the alternative here? the Y T A commenters don't really seem based in reality. Maybe it's just me but I would assume \"I will not make you kill your dad's elderly dog if your dad dies, nor will I hold a grudge against you for not doing so\" is one of those things that is implied in the for better or worse part of the marriage vows, you know?", "Depends on the area. In my county the only dogs you find at shelters are pit bulls. Little curly dogs go in 5 minutes regardless of the age.", "Exactly what I was thinking about. Or \n\"Of course WE bring food for the BBQ.\"  \n\"Of course you can come over in two days and stay for two weeks, no problem at all.\" \n\"Honey, have WE bought a present for the birthday tonight that I am telling you about right now because I don't want to admit I forgot?\"", "Yep. I get that impression of him too. And I think it's really odd how no one is realizing that she's using the dog as a single example of bullying (tho I'd more consider it steam rolling but w/e) when he didn't hide that at all. He clearly wants the focus on the dog and not any of the other things he does"]}
