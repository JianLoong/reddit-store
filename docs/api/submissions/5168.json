I'm not a cat person (allergic), but I'd certainly do my fair share of cat care if needed, including scratches. \n\nRehoming the dog with strangers would be cruel unless there was absolutely no other choice.

If she genuinely feels this way towards you then perhaps there are real relationship issues that need to be spoken about, and if that\u2019s the case it runs deeper than a dog. Sounds like she\u2019s using it as scapegoat to not address the real reasons she might be frustrated. You have cats so obviously it\u2019s not a case of wanting a pet free home, and a low maintenance dog really doesn\u2019t require much work. She\u2019s being inconsiderate of what you went though, sounds completely unwilling to even be negotiable and using it as a way to guilt you.

Plus, you already had pets.  Does the dog cause problems with the cats?  Have a lot of health issues? Destroys things? If not, then you need to have a heart to heart with your wife.  And LISTEN.

It may not even be 5 years. I would hope that your wife could look into her heart and for just a few years - whatever time she has left on earth - be kind to an orphaned senior dog who lost the person who was her whole life.

I feel like I might understand what op is feeling? It\u2019s not just any dog, it\u2019s his dads dog\u2026 Something he most likely cherished. Rehoming the dog would feel like giving away a part of his dad. Obviously idk if that\u2019s exactly how op feels, but that\u2019s the way I see it and I feel like a bit of understanding from his wife isnt the worst thing to expect.", "As someone who has spent the last 10 years terrorized by my husband\u2019s \u201c*NOT* a low maintenance dog,\u201d but puts up with and tries to love (generally hates, still loves, but absolutely does NOT LIKE), simply and singularly, because HE LOVES HER, I don\u2019t think OP is necessarily leaving anything out.   \n\nHe might be over the grief, but not the connection.  \n\nNTA.", "I have to wonder if he's been trying to dump MOST of the chores on her.  It's like how some husbands take in a friend who just lost his job or wife but then the wife ends up having to do all the cleanup/cooking/etc, the actual labor of having an extra person in the house.    I remember an AITA where said friend staying at the house then demanded the woman cook for HIS friends.", "Funny how you make a quick judgement on others but say be gone to those who disagree with your assessment. I think NTA for her inability to see past the dog and support her grieving husband. \n\nGrief makes people react in a way that can overpower reason. Yes communication is key in any healthy relationship. She\u2019s right in saying she doesn\u2019t want the dog, but he\u2019s not the AH for dealing with a hard situation quickly.", "I'm a cat person, I would never DREAM of abandoning my father's pet, even if it's a dog (I don't like dogs)\n\nthis commenter is just cruel, an animal is an animal, all animals need attention, cat's included. u/alien_overlord_1001, you are such a dick", "Ok thanks for answering, did your wife ask to rehome the dog? Or have they ever deliberately ignored the dogs needs like leaving them to go to the toilet in the house when you aren't present or not fill an empty water bowl or feed them when you are away?", "[deleted]", "Wow, found the psycho.", "I got to point out that if someone brought in a volatile and aggressive dog without my consultation, then NO, I would not be happy about it EVER, especially if you insisted I help you take care of it.", "He's now said he's past the grief and is surprised when his wife doesn't want to walk the dog even though it would be convenient. Grief could explain bringing the dog on a temporary basis. Now he's deemed it permanent and he's mad at his wife for not taking on the work of the dog she wasn't consulted about and didn't want. He's moved into YTA territory for sure.", "[removed]", "Aggressive dogs are usually just insecure dogs that need help managing their emotions. My granny\u2019s dog isn\u2019t cured, but I\u2019ve learned her triggers and get by with little to no incidents nowadays. In a shelter that wouldn\u2019t happen and there is a possibility she would be put down. She\u2019s a good dog, very loving towards people, she just needs more work. Great news though, ops dog is polite, so that doesn\u2019t really pertain to them. The emotional connection should be taken into consideration when judging ops actions.", "A dog is not a disposable item to get rid of just because he's past his grief.", "[deleted]", "It's also not a sentimental item he gets to unilaterally bring into their home that sits on a shelf and doesn't affect day to day life. It's a living thing that he wants her to take care of.", "[removed]", "Seems he can deal with it, she's using it as an excuse.", "He can deal with what? She's using what as an excuse for what?"]}
