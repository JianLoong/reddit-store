Sounds like she\u2019s using it as scapegoat to not address the real reasons she might be frustrated. You have cats so obviously it\u2019s not a case of wanting a pet free home, and a low maintenance dog really doesn\u2019t require much work.

It may not even be 5 years. I would hope that your wife could look into her heart and for just a few years - whatever time she has left on earth - be kind to an orphaned senior dog who lost the person who was her whole life.
