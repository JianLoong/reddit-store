His long term domestic partner called to tell me he was on the way to the hospital but was certainly deceased. Her health was poor and she died the same day, which I didn\u2019t learn until much later when she was unreachable. I couldn\u2019t get into the house and had to force the door. The dog was obviously orphaned. A cockapoo, small, easy, mild, 9 years old, no problems. I took the liberty of bringing her home.\n\nMy wife was a little shy of furious but very very angry. She said I should have asked her, that \u201cit\u2019s my house too!\u201d I wouldn\u2019t contradict that, but under the circumstances I was certain that she would understand. I was very hurt by her insensitivity. Obviously I was somewhat stunned by grief and I couldn\u2019t imagine anything other than adopting the dog myself. We own our home and already have two cats. As I said, she\u2019s a low maintenance dog. \n\nMy wife persists to refuse to walk the dog saying \u201cshe\u2019s not my dog\u201d. Occasionally she uses this incident to demonstrate how I\u2019m a bully in the relationship. I have a hard time seeing in objectively. I\u2019m over the grief and I just want some thoughts, so let me know.\n\nClarification: it\u2019s not really about expecting my wife to do dog chores. I just wanted to have an example of the strange dynamic. Like in two years she has never walked the dog. Not once. I have been bold enough to suggest it on occasion, such as when we had evening plans and she was already home but I was going to need to come home versus meeting up, or if I wasn\u2019t feeling great. I\u2019ve been surprised when she holds that boundary. I\u2019m guessing she would walk her if I was incapacitated (she\u2019d be pissed though). She doesn\u2019t actually despise the dog. She chooses to give her treats and things. It\u2019s not really about me expecting my wife to take care of the dog.\n\nTruly, still feel I had no excuse not to take the dog. It was a duty I welcomed. My wife didn\u2019t want it but that wasn\u2019t a suitable reason to defy my conscience. I\u2019m majority YTA so far. I\u2019m certainly not impartial. So be it. I wanted the dog then also I couldn\u2019t imagine being the son who send the dog to strangers or the humane society. Most of the comments have been kind enough.

Sounds like she\u2019s using it as scapegoat to not address the real reasons she might be frustrated. You have cats so obviously it\u2019s not a case of wanting a pet free home, and a low maintenance dog really doesn\u2019t require much work.

At that point, grief is not an excuse for behaving like an AH anymore.\n\nI don't agree with it being an E S H, given the timeframe. Again, if it had *just* happened then sure.

I completely agree with her on this one. also what about the cats in all of this? He hasn't given any thoughts at all to the effect it would have on the cats, the stress it might put their existing animals though.", "I have a beagle that got attacked when he was younger. No injury, but he became far more reactive to other dogs. Especially since he was already timid to start. Specific breeds seemed to bother him more. But it was definitely a fear response, not aggression. And yet people at the dog park would just assume he was aggressive. Between that and the diseases my other dog brought home from the dog park it just wasn\u2019t worth the aggravation to go anymore. Now he\u2019s a grumpy old man dog, but without the strange dogs in his space, he does fine.", "Did you surprise your husband with the dog? Did you talk about it first? He says he's surprised when she doesn't volunteer to walk the dog even though it would be convenient for her.
