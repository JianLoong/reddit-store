I will fully admit that it's my fault for not getting her into treatment sooner, because she's been insisting on everything being in multiples of 3 since she could count. Still, I can't change the past, and now she's got a diagnosis. \n\nHer mother sent her to a psychiatrist who gave her the diagnosis but she's refusing to see him anymore because she said that he scared her. That's fine with me. I can't maker her see him. But I was very clear with her that it's up to her to manage herself if she keeps refusing help. \n\nSince starting high school her insistence on the number 3 has gotten worse, but she's still refusing to do anything about it. Her mother and I are divorced and share custody so I don't fully know what's going on at her house, but when she's at mine she can't even walk through a door without counting her steps and tapping the door 3 times. My younger sister (30f) lives with me and has seen my daughter displaying this behavior, and she's frequently told me, after my daughter's gone to bed, that she thinks I'm a bad father for raising a \"neurotic, out-of-control child\" (her words, not mine). \n\nSo after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself. I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help. \n\nMy daughter started crying and refused to talk to me for a few days.

I started with a cleaning compulsion as in washing my hands multiple times until they cracked and bled and then worked my way into \u00feappung doorknobs, having everything done in threes, only taking food that I'd all the way to the left in line or taking the third drink back in rows. \n\nAm I aware it's weird? Yes. But do I feel like I can stop? No. Because you literally feel like if you don't do the compulsion something bad will happen. You don't know what but something will.

Good thing she doesn\u2019t go to that specific one anymore, but why are you acting like there simply aren\u2019t any available??? You are being a bad parent by not advocating on her behalf.

Let\u2019s break this down: \n\n- You say your daughter is scared of her psychiatrist. What have you done to address this? Is she being harmed by this man? Has he been inappropriate with her? Has he hurt her? Have you asked? Do you know?   \n\n- You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on at her mothers house. Have you asked? Do you discuss this behaviour with your wife? If not, what have you done to educate yourself or investigate what contributes to OCD? What sorts of things have you tried to understand her OCD and to make any changes or modifications that may alleviate your daughter\u2019s stress and unpleasant feelings? What did you do to educate yourself before this diagnosis? It sounds like it\u2019s been going on for some time. \n\n- You\u2019re using language like \u201cshe is refusing\u201d and \u201cshe is getting worse\u201d and \u201cher insistence\u201d and \u201cshe is being weird\u201d. She is 14. She needs help. She is not deliberately fucking with you. She is not purposefully insisting that you have to worship the number 3. I know it\u2019s a tempting narrative to believe but she is not being deliberately difficult, and you know that she isn\u2019t, because she has been doing this exact behaviour for years before she reached an even vague sense of grownup consciousness.   \n\n- Please educate yourself on the statistics around suicide and neurodiversity, they are extremely sobering. One datapoint I have seen is that neurodiverse people attempt suicide 9 times more often than the neurotypical population. Can you see now why this is so much bigger than your disinterest or your sister\u2019s crappy comments? This is your child, at higher risk of taking her own life, because of the terror and confusion that can come with being neurodivergent _and the way people treat neurodiverse people who are just trying to live their lives and find a scrap of happiness_\n\n- You are placing expectations on a child that an adult would struggle to meet. She is doing no one any harm. She isn\u2019t hurting animals or humans. She\u2019s got a thing about the number 3. What\u2019s the big deal? Your asshole sister\u2019s asinine comments are more important than the struggles of the child you helped bring into existence?  Don\u2019t you want to make life easier for your child? Even if she does not meet the criteria you believe qualify as \u2018normal\u2019?\n\n- Have you got any manifestations of OCD, autism, ADD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, Tourette\u2019s, dysgraphia, bipolar, or any of the other ways of being that sit under the neurodiversity umbrella, in your family? Have you even done any research on OCD? Have you resisted it because perhaps it hits a bit close to home?   \n \n- At a very basic level, children look to parents to keep them safe, to explain the world, to help them, to protect them, to tell them they are wonderful just the way they are, even if they have a few quirks, or are bullied for being different. Being told you are Weird by a parent is *world-breaking*. You\u2019ve probably done unalterable damage to your relationship and I would not be surprised if your daughter lost an incredible amount of trust for you.

Why are you not seeking a different doctor? Why are you making her treat herself? I\u2019m speechless.", "YTA.  Your daughter had an issue with that psychiatrist, the correct response would have been to find out exactly what her issues were and try to find a different one that she would be more comfortable with.  The fact that you are concerned with what people think about your parenting instead of the welfare of your child makes you a massive AH.", "YTA. I bet you let her drop therapy and then told her to manage herself, saved you paying the therapist didn\u2019t it? Then when it became apparent she couldn\u2019t manage herself, something that came up in a conversation with the disgusting person you call a sister, you decided shaming her is the answer, and now can\u2019t understand why she\u2019s upset. Hmmm. I wonder.", "YTA.  You clearly have no clue what you are doing.  Your daughter, like many others including myself, is suffering from a mental illness.  As someone with OCD it is not something you can always control.  It\u2019s there in the actual name of the illness, OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE!!!! I assume you understand those 2 words? \n\nAdd to that the extra stress of her parents divorce on top of her OCD and you have a recipe for potential meltdown.   Then you come along and tell her she\u2019s weird? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s already very aware that her behavior is odd but have you looked up the literal definition of obsessive or compulsive?", "You are father. Let other folks call her weird, not you.", "Yta. She\u2019s a minor. It doesn\u2019t matter if she doesn\u2019t want to go to a dr. She\u2019s mentally unwell. You take her anyway! And now you are putting the blame on her. Man up and be a parent", "Soft YTA Shes not trying to act weird. She has a mental illness. She probably needs cbt or meds or both.

I have a child with OCD, and I'm sickened by this to my core. There I was hauling a newborn, with a toddler, and with my child who has OCD to appointment after appointment when I could have just... what? Punished my child? Told my child to handle it themselves? Watched them suffer day after day?\n\nThis child should be removed from the care of these people who don't care about her. My god, OP, get her into an ERP therapist. Get her into specialists in your area. Join groups for parents of children with OCD.\n\nYou sicken me, OP. Get your child help. She is SUFFERING. Can you imagine being stuck in her head? I sobbed when I saw my child like that. Other parents cried. Get her help!", "Not just an asshole, he's also ableist as fuck. If she could control her behavior, she probably would. But that's pretty much the definition of OCD. OP should be talking to his daughter about why she doesn't want to see the psychiatrist, would she be willing to try with a different psychiatrist, and what things he and her mom could do to make her life less stressful.", "She's *fourteen* and OP is expecting her to regulate herself. Even adults with OCD often struggle.", "This is it, to a T. Op needs to put daughter up for adoption", "It is SO hard to manage, and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with male therapists. It also takes time and effort, and trial and error. She needs parents to HELP her through this!", "You are brilliant. Of course the third doctor will be the one. Why was a total stranger able to come to this conclusion and her father was not? There are so many ways to attack this from that angle, make the appointments on dates that have a three in them, make them at 3pm, make sure the address has a 3 in it, or the phone number. Anything to make the visit palatable, and we know threes are important, use that, do what you have to do, drive 3 miles, walk three blocks whatever it takes to get her some help. I hadn\u2019t considered it until you pointed it out but you would think OP would have, it\u2019s his daughter.", "Also you realize this guy didn't get his daughter diagnosed her mother is the one that set up the Dr appt. The mother is the only capable of doing anything. If this doctor didn't work out LOOK FOR ANOTHER ONE. YOU DONT TELL YOUR 14 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO FIGURE OUT TO MANAGE HER MENTAL ILLNESS HERSELF. Stop being a lazy father.", "Do you actually want your kid or do you only have partial custody to lower/eliminate your obligation to pay child support?  If you're incapable of parenting a child with a mental illness then you need to ceede full custody to her mother and provide financial support instead.  Imagine how much easier your life would be if you didn't have to deal with your weird kid.", "not all therapists look like freud, so there's no reason not to get her a different one. not all therapists and patients are compatible, that doesn't mean she doesn't want help at all", "Find a different one.

You didn\u2019t get the help your daughter needed and you\u2019re still not getting it for her. \n\nI hate to tell you this, but washing your hands of your child and letting her fall through the cracks is an exact definition of a bad parent. Your entire job as her parent is to give her the tools she needs to succeed, and if you can\u2019t do that then your reputation should be the least of your concerns.\n\nYou can\u2019t change the past but you\u2019re doing a pretty crappy job in the present, and that\u2019s on you.", "So then TAKE HER TO ANOTHER ONE. How are you so inept that the simplest solution apparently never crossed your mind? Is there some kind of medical reason that you're incapable of basic problem solving? Do you care so little for your own child that you'll give up that easily, and if so, why the fuck do you care if she goes to stay with her mother?", "From what I hear, you don't stop going to therapy because you don't like the doctor, you try a different doctor until you find one that clicks. She's still a minor I assume. Make her try a different doctor.\n\nAlso, some people don't find being called weird an insult. But if it makes your daughter cry, and you knew that ahead of time, YTA. Maybe work on that.", "Then find her one who doesn\u2019t look like Freud. She would probably be much more comfortable with a female psychiatrist", "So go on psychology today, look at some pictures of local psychiatrists and see who she gets good vibes from.", "So....there's only one psychiatrist in your area? Find her another. For pity's sake, mental illness treatment is not something that she takes a pill, drinks a potion, and everything is fine again. This is a lifelong issue for her.", "Then find her one that doesn't look like Freud.  That is an issue that shouldn't apply to many people and should be very easy to work around.  YTA.", "So, why didn't either you or your ex find another therapist who she felt comfortable with instead of throwing up your hands & telling her (a literal child) to \"manage herself\"?\n\nYTA & so is your sister. As a parent it's *your* job to get your daughter help when needed & not scold her when someone makes you upset for calling you a bad parent because they don't like how your daughter's mental health is causing her to do things that annoys them & nothing else. \n\nI feel for your daughter. Instead of telling your sister that *she* was out of line for speaking that way about your daughter, you chose to lash out at your child calling her weird & telling her to \"manage herself\". That's more than bad parenting. It's terrible. Shame on you & shame on your sister. Your daughter needs help. Not two grown AH adults judging her for something that her brain is causing her to do. You both should feel ashamed of yourselves for treating her like you have. Apologize & be a better father while telling your sister to mind her business.", "Well, since all psychiatrists are required by law to look like Feud, I guess she\u2019s just out of luck.  Good job telling her to hide her symptoms better so as to not embarrass you - she needs to realize her illness is about you and what others think of you.

It's a freaking nightmare to live with and people minimize the hell out of it, acting like it's just being quirky or difficult. Nothing has made my life harder than having OCD.", "Absolutely. I also have ocd and it is so exhausting. I am fully aware I may come across as different, but there is little to no control over it.  I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until I was 32.

It  wars with my autism and ADHD, and the Adderall I have to take to fight the executive dysfunction of those two disabilities makes my OCD so much worse; but nothing we can do about it that we aren't doing already. \n\nUgh it just fucking blows. \n\nOp is THE biggest ah  for his attitude, and also for not putting his foot down and making a CHILD get the medical treatment they need when he can obviously see she is suffering.\n\nNo kid likes going to the doctor, but guess what it's 100% necessary and is 100% the parents' responsibility to make sure it happens. Bc what we WANT to do or LIKE to do (or what we  don't  want/like to do)  isn't always what's best for us, at all. And a 14yo child isn't capable of discerning/deciding things 100% on her own.\n\nThat said, op SHOULD, ofc, respect her input/fears/etc related to the therapy process, and in this case if I were him, I would be first off asking my daughter why this man/doctor \"scared her\"; and then I'd address it appropriately (For ex, is she just anxious about therapy, and not comfortable discussing her issues just yet, so is \"scared\" to see this doctor? Or did he do something to make her feel unsafe/unheard/ etc etc??). If the forner, discuss this with her doctor and ask his ideas on how to ease this fear. If the latter, then research and vet various other, new docs and let daughter have a large role in choosing one; this gives her some control over the situation and helps her develop independence ).", "\"I'm sure my *14yo* who's been struggling with this condition for years is perfectly capable of figuring out how to manage it all on her own even though she hasn't managed it so far.

Good God.", "self manage? she's a child, she doesn't know what she's doing. she shouldn't be left to fend for herself because she rejected her first therapist, professional help will be vital to her managing her condition. parents who knowingly and willingly let their kids suffer from untreated conditions, whether physical or mental, aren't good parents", "Because what you said is beyond dumb", "Yeah I am literally crippled most by ocd. I have a bunch of other stuff but nothing has messed me up as bad.
