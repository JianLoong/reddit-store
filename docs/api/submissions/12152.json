I will fully admit that it's my fault for not getting her into treatment sooner, because she's been insisting on everything being in multiples of 3 since she could count. Still, I can't change the past, and now she's got a diagnosis. \n\nHer mother sent her to a psychiatrist who gave her the diagnosis but she's refusing to see him anymore because she said that he scared her. That's fine with me. I can't maker her see him. But I was very clear with her that it's up to her to manage herself if she keeps refusing help. \n\nSince starting high school her insistence on the number 3 has gotten worse, but she's still refusing to do anything about it. Her mother and I are divorced and share custody so I don't fully know what's going on at her house, but when she's at mine she can't even walk through a door without counting her steps and tapping the door 3 times. My younger sister (30f) lives with me and has seen my daughter displaying this behavior, and she's frequently told me, after my daughter's gone to bed, that she thinks I'm a bad father for raising a \"neurotic, out-of-control child\" (her words, not mine). \n\nSo after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself. I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help. \n\nMy daughter started crying and refused to talk to me for a few days.

Your daughter needs your help, and whether you like it or not, you and her mother need to communicate with one another about this. I don't care if you can't stand the woman, both of you are this child's parents and your child is in need of help, and if you can't even say a civil word to one another about anything else you must communicate about your daughter's health.\n\nApologise to your daughter. Help her find a psychiatrist and a therapist. Educate yourself about her condition. And be her ***parent***.\n\nEdited a typo", "Yta. News flash you are a bad parent and don't be surprised if she goes LC to NC with you once she can. Your sister isn't any better too. You both need to work on better people.", "NTA - It seems to me that you're talking about her refusal to get treatment being weird, not that her diagnosis is weird. That's a big difference and I think she's conflating the two.", "This comment. You're an ass OP. YTA.", "Well said!", "That's what I heard!  OP YTA!", "And the fact that they know nothing about OCD, did him and sissy \ud83d\ude12 ever think to look up what it's about, that you can't \"raise\" a person that way ..all these years they know and still couldn't give af", "Also the idea that it\u2019s either one male psychiatrist or nothing is insane. I\u2019ve had over five psychologists I\u2019ve worked with and only ever opened up to 1!!! It\u2019s very important to feel safe with the person whose treating you. And he didn\u2019t even investigate what the psychiatrist did to scare her??? Absolute YTA", "This. OP, find a new therapist and check your sister when she says ableist things about her own niece.\n\nIf you're worried about being a bad parent, this is the bare minimum.", "Yeah, his reaction should have been to shame his *sister*, not his daughter. Not only is his sister the adult, she can control her mouth far easier than the daughter can control her OCD. Furthermore, the OCD doesn't seem to have any *real* effect on others unlike the sister's unwarranted criticism and idiotic ableism.", "I'm pissssseddd.. \"raising\" her that way, you don't raise a disability ..and OCD gets worse by stress so no wonder it's like that when she's around those 2 AHs", "These are good suggestions.\nTry harder to get her into appropriate mental help.\nRight now you are being a shit parent, YTA. And so is your sister!", "She went to one doctor who scared her. Why are the only options a scary man or no treatment at all? Even with adults, it usually takes some trial and error to find a doctor you like.", "As a parent, it\u2019s on OP to lovingly and supportively help his child find a doctor who the 14 year old child feels comfortable with.  And perhaps that means he goes, (and maybe if the co-parenting relationship is not toxic, he and the child\u2019s mom go together) and pre- interview different doctors.  Try to explain to the doctors you interview that the child is uncomfortable with seeing someone for this issue and do they have a suggestion how to overcome the reluctance.  Find one he you thinks may relate well with his child\u2019s personality.  Maybe a first visit by FaceTime or virtual visit. Perhaps anxiety about change is why she doesn\u2019t to have treatment.  OP states from the age of counting she has displayed this type of behavior so treatment for this feels new and perhaps frightening to the child.  OP is the AH for calling his child weird.  If he didn\u2019t mean that SHE is weird but her behavior is weird, still the AH.  OP also needs to make sure his child feels comfortable in his home and he and his sister can perhaps see a councilor as well to understand the diagnosis and how a 14 year old should have compassion in dealing with her diagnosis.", "It seems to me that you've misread what was said ..he literally said that she's being weird AND needs to get her behaviour under control, he made the title himself, if he wanted to say that the refusal was weird, he would have put it in\n\n\" after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself.\"\n\nAlso he's clearly only worried what HE looks like and not actually even bothered to do any research on OCD him and his sister don't seem to give af, otherwise they would not say horrible things or think you can \"raise\" a person to have a disorder \n\n\" I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help.\"", "Yea exactly.. nothing about why he scared her ..just \"that's fine with me\" \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  so unbothered", "He didn't say they (either parent) refused to take her to a different doctor, he said she refused help and is refusing to self-manage."]}
