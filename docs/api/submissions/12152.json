I will fully admit that it's my fault for not getting her into treatment sooner, because she's been insisting on everything being in multiples of 3 since she could count. Still, I can't change the past, and now she's got a diagnosis. \n\nHer mother sent her to a psychiatrist who gave her the diagnosis but she's refusing to see him anymore because she said that he scared her. That's fine with me. I can't maker her see him. But I was very clear with her that it's up to her to manage herself if she keeps refusing help. \n\nSince starting high school her insistence on the number 3 has gotten worse, but she's still refusing to do anything about it. Her mother and I are divorced and share custody so I don't fully know what's going on at her house, but when she's at mine she can't even walk through a door without counting her steps and tapping the door 3 times. My younger sister (30f) lives with me and has seen my daughter displaying this behavior, and she's frequently told me, after my daughter's gone to bed, that she thinks I'm a bad father for raising a \"neurotic, out-of-control child\" (her words, not mine). \n\nSo after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself. I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help. \n\nMy daughter started crying and refused to talk to me for a few days.

It sounds like the help offered by OP to the minor daughter was: \n\n>\"So after a few days of this I pulled my daughter aside and told her that she's being weird and needs to get her behavior under control. I told her quite simply that it's her prerogative if she thinks she can manage herself better than a doctor can but, in that case, she had better actually manage herself. I'm not going to be scorned for bad parenting when I've offered my daughter help\"\n\nWhat kind of choice is that? What makes OP believe she (at 14) is qualified enough to make such a decision, given she was only recently diagnosed within the last three months? What does management look like for her? \n\nOther viable options would be taking the time to work with her to help her find a therapist she is comfortable with; does OP even know why the daughter experienced discomfort with the original therapist? Was it a reasonable concern, or was it the idea of therapy in general? Finding out how you can help her with the management of her illness, and asking your sister not to talk about your daughter's mental state while she is in the house unless she is being encouraging would go a long way in making your daughter believe you actually want her to get better and will be supportive as she does so.", "Well, I mean she's kinda right. Knocking on everything 3 times means she doesn't have to deal with that asshole anymore", "I see this all the time on Reddit. \u201cMy child is extremely mentally ill and I\u2019ve tried everything but nothing is working!\u201d \u201cWhat exactly have you tried?\u201d \u201cWe went to one therapist and tried one medication and it didn\u2019t work!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s gonna take a little more than that dude.", "This is really the \"classic\" manifestation of OCD in pop culture... I'm not really sure how they weren't like \"Hm, I bet she has OCD.\"", "Because that would require him spending time, effort and money to help his daughter. Judging from the post he's a 'do the bare minimum for my kid, anything else they need is their responsibility' type parent. He's the same type of parent to be surprised when their kid goes no contact as soon as they can because he \"gave her sooooooo much\". It does my head in.", "Find one who doesn't look like Freud. Problem solved.", "Find a different one. You are being a bad father and her mother is being a bad mother. You\u2019re the adults it\u2019s your responsibility to find her help and make sure she\u2019s comfortable with whoever is helping her", "She's 14.  She might have problems opening up emotionally to some severe-looking old dude.  It's really common to take a few tries before you find a good fit for a therapist.  You really need to keep looking!  \n\nIt's unreasonable that she's got such severe symptoms and you're insisting she handle it herself (how's that been working out for her, up until now?).  She needs therapy, and it's your job as parents to find her a therapist that will work for her.", "Is there only one psychiatrist driving distance from you? Calling her weird is not effective. I suggest you educate yourself on how OCD works. Your daughter does not want to engage in these behaviors. They are called compulsions because she feels compelled to and feels like something will go wrong if she doesn\u2019t. Sometimes people with OCD feel like they control whether someone will live or die. She\u2019s not being weird. She\u2019s sick.", "Did they even ask you that?", "get her a new one then!!  you have to expose yourself to that person and if she doesn't feel comfortable it is your job to find someone she is comfortable with!!", "exactly! I\u2019m sure she\u2019s wishing she didn\u2019t feel the way she\u2019s feeling, but she won\u2019t just \u201cstop\u201d the way OP wants her to. It\u2019s exhausting, frustrating and she needs real support.", "you are aware there's more than one physiatrist in the world, and in your area right?", "When I was around her age I found it easier to speak to female psychiatrists because I felt more comfortable. I have no idea if that would help her, but she may be interested in trying it", "And you didn't think to be like, oh ok, let's find you a new doctor who doesn't look like Freud? That just didn't cross your mind? Instead you decided to insult your child instead? Grow the fuck up and BE A PARENT.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you think her fear is unreasonable; she does not connect with this psychiatrist and needs a different one, probably younger and/or female. Do a 5 minute Google search for \u201cchild psychiatrists near me\u201d. If insurance is the issue, you can find lists of in-network providers on your insurance company\u2019s website. BE A PARENT!", "So find someone else for your daughter to go see. I will tell you right now, most teenage girls are *not* going to connect well with an old, male clinician. I work at a semi-private practice and the two of us in the office who are youngest end up with *all* our office\u2019s child/adolescent clients, often after they\u2019ve struggled to work with the older clinicians. \n\nYour 14 year old is not solely responsible for her mental health here\u2014you, as a parent, need to make some actual effort to find her support and assistance. Instead, you\u2019re content to throw up your hands because the *one* option\u2014which her mother found, not you\u2014didn\u2019t work out. The fact that you\u2019d rather shame her for the behaviors and think she should be able to just get it under control on her own is ridiculous. If she could, don\u2019t you think she fucking would have, years ago? But you don\u2019t care about what she\u2019s going through. You\u2019re more worried about how her behavior reflects on *you*.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be judged as a bad parent because your daughter is struggling with a mental illness that\u2019s gone undiagnosed until recently? Then be a better parent. YTA\n\n\nETA: side note, most *psychiatrists* don\u2019t do therapy, and primarily do medication management. Your daughter doesn\u2019t *need* to see a psychiatrist, so I don\u2019t want to hear how hard it is to get in with one. There\u2019s a whole wide world of mental health practitioners to choose from. Find a therapist/counselor in your area who specializes in OCD or anxiety disorders in general. Maybe include your daughter in the process\u2014you can often find profiles, pictures, etc. of clinicians on their websites or on sites like Psychology Today.", "So you\u2019re just gonna give up and let a child dictate her own mental health with no intervention? YTA", "Sure why not ?", "She should make sure to tell him three times to go fuck himself next time she sees him as well!", "Somebody did. Maybe I responded to the wrong comment.", "Psychologytoday.com is a great tool for searching for a mental health expert in your area. You can filter by insurance, location, online or in person, diagnoses they treat/specialize in, etc. \n\nOP, you\u2019re the adult. Instead of making your child feel bad for a mental illness they didn\u2019t ask to have, do your job as the father and help her.
