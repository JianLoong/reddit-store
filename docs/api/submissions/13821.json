I do front line, so there's a lot of talking. I am also hard of hearing. I do not wear a hearing aid, but I have enough hearing loss combined with apd (auditory processing disorder) to make too many noises at once a NIGHTMARE. I tell everyone this. My manger knew this when he hired me, everyone on every shift knows, ECT. \n\nHere's where my coworker (20? Ish, F) comes in: a month-ish, maybe 2 months ago, we worked a shift together. We're not close, she's new, i don't typically work a shift with her, ECT. But she's fine. Part way through, I'm pouring drinks and she comes up to me and tells me she doesn't appreciate being ignored. I am confused. We haven't said anything to each other. There was nothing to ignore. She tells me she asked me a question a \"few minutes ago\" and I didn't answer. I explain to her that I just couldn't hear her, and she knows I have issues with it. She says it's immature for me to be laughing (I'm laughing at the stupidity of this conversation) and I need to grow up and listen to people. Naturally, I don't like this and now I start to dislike her. Who calls someone immature for having hearing issues? I told her \"ok\" and continued on with my shift, just as \"immaturely\" as before. \n\nto cut it down (word limit) i do not add to the peace, but I also don't take away. I simply do not talk to her unless it's work related. \n\nWell today, like 2 hours ago, she comes up to \"apologize\" and talk to me. I put my phone down (my job is incredibly relaxed, which makes up for my awful coworkers). She talks about how she doesn't have bad blood and this and that. I tell her I do. She called me immature for a disability I have, that she knew I have, and then waited 2 months to apologize when she knew that was the only thing bothering me. She tried to pull the \"I was in jail for 2 months\" line, but we had worked together the weekend before and I had seen her on shift changes. So if she's referring to prior to her working here, that's irrelevant. \n\nI KNOW she waited until our gm talked to her to apologize. A different manager told me they had over heard him talking to her about it. \n\nShe then threatened to go to our gm about our \"working situation\" because I am being difficult. I told her I'm done with this conversation. I won't accept her apology that needed to be forced out. She kept trying to talk to me when I walked away, tried again when I came back (I went into lobby to clean up a little) and I kept telling her I am not speaking about this anymore. I don't care if she goes to the gm, if she was really sorry, she wouldn't have waited 2 months. I have done nothing to make work harder. Maybe she doesn't enjoy being around me, but I have never messed up her station, left her behind, slacked, ect. \n\nI know our gm is gonna talk to me, and I'm going to tell him the same thing I told her. But am I being unreasonable?", "created_utc": 1680448076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129nyaf/aita_for_not_accepting_a_coworkers_apology/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're good", "NTA- what a lot of people don't understand is exactly what APD is. Some just assume HOH and its not. When you add in both it can be extremely difficult and confusing. Let your GM know exactly what you said and reiterate the statement you made. Also maybe tell him that IF he wants to know what you experience there are things on Youtube that somewhat simulate APD. Let them know you do not \"talk\" for many reasons, one of which is her attitude but also because in order to do you job you need to focus on tasks and that you cannot do that while someone is gossiping to or near you. That IF she needs to tell you something work related, she can make sure you are looking at her or maybe tap your shoulder to get your attention. That you do not appreciate her trying to get your attention for non-work related things for the stated reasons above and that you have no wish to have non-work related relationship so you do not need to have non-work related conversations.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to accept her apology, and you don\u2019t even have to like her. All you have to do is remain professional and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done. \n\nAnything problems she has with that are on her.", "YTA. \n\nYou are trying to extract an emotion that\u2019s not there. She apologized, in general you should accept.", "Was she? An auditory processing disorder is not visible. Furthermore, people that have it can sometimes respond normally in quiet surroundings, but have difficulty distinguishing voices from surrounding sound when in noisy situations. It can be confusing and counterintuitive to others, and they *can* feel intentionally ignored.\n\nShe was at least making an effort to approach OP and resolve the issue. Laughing in her face seems like an AH move to me.", "Nothing about me is even agressive. I am factual. I correct everyone who has things wrong. You can see the amount comments are unanswered, and I haven't upvoted/down voted anyone. That's all it is", "I am HOH on TOP of my APD. It doesn't matter if it's visible, she knew as I directly told her upon meeting her because I trained her. \n\nThe only reason she made an effort was because my manager told her to. Even then, she was still harsh during the conversation but those details aren't necessary for this story, because all she did was attack me for things unrelated to work.\n\nI didn't \"laugh in her face\" I laughed because it's ridiculous to accuse me of things instead of simply asking why the person who cannot hear didn't respond to a question.", "OP mentions that she was aware in the story? And after over a month and she somehow isn\u2019t aware then that's on her, not OP", "Honey fucking chill I was talking about your coworker. Can you read?", "I would think that her approaching OP to resolve it merited an explanation and not contempt. Maybe ESH, but OP definitely strikes me as an AH.", "I did read what you said. Given we both use she pronouns and what you said can EASILY apply to me assuming you think I'm in the wrong, it's easy to see how this happened.", "In this context you could more easily assume Im addressing YOU on your own damn post", "No I couldn't.... That's why I responded....", "Im starting to see that you were BOTH the problem", "ESH. I find it hard to believe you can't hear and are working in a place that would make that difficult. It's bogus to expect everyone to automatically know or remember your condition.", "\"She says it's immature for me to be laughing (I'm laughing at the stupidity of this conversation)\"\n\nShe wasn't calling you immature for being disabled, she was calling you immature for your immature laughing, wasn't she? I wouldn't apologize either unless I was forced, because she's right, that's immature. Unpopular opinion, but there it is. YTA", "She is obligated to apologise, but forgiveness is your privilege, not your obligation. NTA", "NTA you are under no obligation to forgive someone. Sorry isn't a magical word to fix everything, sometimes being a jerk sticks", "NTA. I was rehired at a local fast food chain in September 2021. We rehired an Autistic woman. I was rehired as an assistant manager. So I ran all evening shifts but my 2 days off. We made everyone at drive thru window wear a headset. I wasn\u2019t told anything about her when I came back after my days off. So I tell her she has to wear a headset. She explained that something to do with her Autism made it so she couldn\u2019t understand anything through the headset. So I immediately said no problem and never asked her again. I think I might have apologized since I didn\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t hard to respect her condition. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to respect yours either. I don\u2019t make friends with coworkers so I never saw her outside of work. But it really wasn\u2019t hard to work with her.", "as someone who has worked in the food industry, itd literally be the easiest part of the job to remember that one specific person has hearing loss and might miss something you say. if, say, 7 people had hearing loss out of 50 then it might be hard to remember who does and who doesnt, but one person? thats easier than 90% of the entire job description", "What does this mean and why is it being downvoted so much", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed due to a [rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) violation.
