On one hand, it\u2019s not cool to ask why he hid his screen (assuming he even did) if you hadn\u2019t any reason to be suspicious. On the other hand, if he has nothing to hide he would have been open about showing you what he was looking at. \n\nThe only real options are 1) he was looking for a present for you, 2) he was talking to someone he didn\u2019t want you to know about, or 3) he was searching what to do about hemorrhoids or something. \n\nBut I\u2019m inclined to say ESH", "YTA - Trying to restrict his communication with his friends.\n\n>the people he speaks to that im not on good terms with\n\nEven when he's alone, he got to worry about you sneaking around and insulting him for to talking to people.

If you can\u2019t trust him, then why are you even in a relationship??", "YTA for insisting.\n\nYou say you trust him but your actions say otherwise. You\u2019re oddly insistent over the pettiest of things (whether or not he admits his behavior was suspicious). You said in a comment that there are private things you don\u2019t tell each other but then in another comment you declare he should tell you about things like porn and not keep things from you. You say you don\u2019t think he would cheat but then imply this kind of behavior might lead you to think he is cheating in the future.\n\nWhat exactly do you want out of this situation? It sounds like at this point it is just an argument out of pride. You want to be right and you want him to concede and agree with you so that you can be. Do you trust him or not? Are you able to let this one suspicious incident go or not? Do you need him to tell you everything before you can trust him, or is he allowed to have some things he doesn\u2019t tell you?\n\nWhy do you want to stay together? I mean, you two were already on cool terms from a previous argument and then got into another one. This doesn\u2019t seem like the most stable or understanding relationship.

It is slightly sus that he turned the screen away from you, notably closed out of whatever he was doing, and lied that he wasn\u2019t doing anything (when it was clear he was doing something). While not indicative of cheating, it is strange behavior and you have the right to be in your feelings about the interaction. Maybe he was doing something you wouldn\u2019t approve of, or maybe he was planning a surprise for you and didn\u2019t want it to be spoiled. Who knows! Just communicate your feelings to him, listen to his side of things, have a talk about it. It certainly isn\u2019t anything to worry about unless it becomes a repeated offense paired with increasingly strange behavior. Things might be weird because of your previous argument the night before, too! So maybe start with that and communicate effectively, get all those bundled up feels out, and apologize where apologies are due. Hope the best for you two. \u2661", "YTA\n\nYou didn't approach him accusing him of cheating; however, the way that you asked him who he was talking to, definitely came off that you were already suspicious of him for something... hence why he was probably so quick to become defensive with you.\n\nYou don't trust him, and it really showed when you came up to him already defensive/accusatory. Everyone has a right to alone time and privacy. It doesn't always have to mean that they're being sneaky. I'm sorry that's something you're worried about\u2013 it could be helpful to do some self-reflection to understand better why you are so distrusting of him, and if it continues to be a source of anxiety and harm your relationship, maybe it's time to move on.\n\nIf you're worried he's talking to people you aren't on good terms with, and he knows you're not on good terms with them... that's something the two of you need to navigate.

Turns out i was right. He was cheating.", "NTA, don't let these reddit idiots gaslight you. He hid his phone screen for a reason I am sure. Ask him if he minds you using his phone for a bit and see if he gets nervous. In an iPhone go into the photos app and see if he has any hidden photos, youtube how to find where they are. There is the same thing on android. Does he have any weird messaging apps? I would wager my left nut he is up to something not good. I used to run a investigation business and have seen it all, I got paid for finding information like this out and helped hundreds of clients find what they needed to know though various methods. He showed you his tabs because he was in private browsing mode so he closed it quickly and it would not show up on his history. If you have access to your home router there are ways you can log connections, it won't tell you exactly what he is doing but it could indicate what websites he is going to, like if you and him are the only ones on the router and it is connecting to [Tinder.com](https://Tinder.com) that gives you a clue. Another thing you can do is go to popular dating apps and say you forgot your password and if it asks for a phone number enter his number because it will send his phone a text if he is in their system. Ahh reddit is going to hate me for this entire comment but there are so many ways you can investigate this and don't let this guy gas light you and call you names for being suspicious. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT when it goes off like that don't listen to random strangers on reddit who know nothing. THis is the age of cheating. Not saying he 100% was cheating but at the very least up to something like watching porn but since he wasn't jerking at the time probably fucking around. Look into this.", "honestly i do believe him when he says he wasnt doing anything wrong, but i think it was something private that he didn't want to involve me in. all i wanted was an explanation for purposely hiding the phone from me, as theres no logical reason anyone would do this unless they didn't want what they were doing to be seen. i dont have trust issues with him and im not going to leave him over something so insignificant.", "YTA- for all you know he could've been buying you an apology gift.

He gets to have an inner life, and have friends of any gender, as well as confidentiality with any/all of them.\n\nIf he does something wrong, act accordingly.

There\u2019s really no way of knowing if it\u2019s anything worth thinking about, unless you see an actual red flag. But if you live your life like this, being so deeply suspicious of a ridiculously minor thing like not being included in his every thought\u2026you\u2019re gonna make both of you miserable, and you\u2019re gonna drive him away. \n\nYou went accusatory right out of the gate, and it signifies deep, *deep* insecurity.

Sounds to me like he was trying to exist in a space he wasn\u2019t comfortable with and being in that defensive mindset makes anything he does need to be hidden. Speaking from experience. My suggestion is resolve the issue you had the argument about before hopping on his behavior while clearly uncomfortable and on edge. YTA", "Ok, if I am looking at things from your perspective then this is where I\u2019m at:\n\n1. Your bf could possibly be looking at something he would like to keep private, maybe he was on AITA talking about the argument you previously had. Maybe he wants to keep it private away from you. On that note: does he know about this post? \n\n2. It sounds like you are projecting your emotions about the previous fight into this. There was no reason to mention the fight, other than that you think it has something to do with this, which it doesn\u2019t. \n\nTry to give your bf the benefit of the doubt, and even then, he isn\u2019t in the wrong for not wanting you to know his every last action.

People are making assumptions based on your story because you posted it in this sub to ask people what they thought of it.  If you didn't want people to chime in, why ask?", "YTA. I basically summed up why in a reply to one of your comments, but I want to add that you do not own him. If he has to communicate with his friends - who, btw, you don't need to be friends with - because you don't like them, that's a red flag. If I was dating you, and you pulled that shit with me, I don't care where we are, it would be over right then and there. If you told me to cut contact with *any* of my friends or the little bit of my family that I still talk to, it would be over. You have no right to every single aspect of his life. You are not entitled to know or be part of his inner circle.\n\nI don't know or care when, where, or how you learned that it's okay to be controlling and paranoid, but you need to get a handle on that. It's very unattractive.", "YTA - I would be upset if I were him too. Just because your boyfriend hid his screen from you doesn't mean that he's cheating. A person is entitled to their privacy, and should get benefit of the doubt. Otherwise, why are you with someone that you don't trust to own their own phone?\n\nA phone is like a diary, and if it's not yours, it's not for you to access without permission. It's not for you to monitor. Everyone is entitled to their privacy, and everyone keeps things in their phone that they don't want anyone else to see, however stupid and innocent it is.\n\nIf you don't trust him, you don't respect him. If you turn something like this into what you did, treating him like a child rather than a partner, of course he's going to be made to feel as though he's done something wrong when it's likely that he didn't. Without trust and respect, love doesn't count for shit.\n\nWe yell at guys here that insist on looking through their gf's phone because it's controlling behavior. This is not much different. Unless you have a real reason to be insecure and jealous, all you're doing when you make a scene like this is being controlling. Keep that up, and you'll be single. No one wants to be treated like they've done something wrong when they haven't.", "YTA. I have nothing to hide from my partner but I hate when they sneak a glance at my phone screen and ask questions about who I'm texting or what I'm looking at.

You need to approach with the right tone.", "If there is no trust it will not work", "YTA what if he was looking for a gift for you?", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like it was a one off. He's allowed some privacy and if he said \"it's private\" would that really have helped or escalated it more in your mind? \n\nIf that is the only reason you're being suspicious, it sounds like you're over thinking it.", "YTA.  I mean this from the bottom of my heart, and in the most sincere manner possible, but girl you need a hobby.

You shouldn't be so concerned with what's on your boyfriend's phone screen. If you were being cheated on it will come to light eventually regardless of you pursuing it, and there are better ways to know other than snooping. We live in an age where we keep our phones on us at all times and use them for almost anything, hence he could have been doing almost anything. If he didn't want to share that with you right that second it is NOT evidence of guilt, and acting on it as if his unwillingness to share means he did something wrong is unfair.

Also who knows, maybe in a previous relationship you dealt with this before and that could be why you got so upset to begin with. To that I would say, just remember he isn't that person you were with before. \n\nCommunication is always key! \n\nAnd I agree with you, everyone dogging on you can piss off, but also don't post it on Reddit if you don't want to hear it \ud83d\ude05", "YTA!\n\nI know this might be hard for you to understand but there is a thing called 'Privacy'.

Note it down on your phone calendar, and do it whenever you get this same feeling. Sometimes it's easier to see when there is a pattern in his behaviour that way, and on the other side of the coin it can also highlight if your emotions are possibly linked to your hormonal cycle or perhaps something else outwith the relationship. There's also the possibility you were feeling raw from the argument and projecting your feelings, but again only you'll know this.", "YTA\n\nIf you\u2019re a guy doing this it\u2019s automatically creepy and controlling. So \u2026equality.", "yta", "Eh, I'll go against the grain and say NTA, but tread carefully.\n\nI believe if he truly had nothing to hide, he would have had a simple, non-emotionally reactive explanation.

ANYTHING. \n\nThe fact that he didn't have any kind of explanation + him becoming extremely defensive over it and flipping it around onto you, making you out to be the one in the wrong...is never a good sign. He was clearly emotionally on edge about being \"caught\" doing something he inherently feels or knows is wrong, otherwise he would have had no reason to react the way he did, at least IMO. Speaking from personal experience, anyone who has nothing bad to hide has no reason to react in such a way. But that's my experience, which will differ from yours, of course.\n\nEither way, I hope for your sake OP that it really was nothing and that the two of you have a long and happy relationship together.", "I find it incredibly odd how people are telling you not to jump to conclusions while also slinging the following:\n\u201cUnhinged\u201d\n\u201cUnstable\u201d\n\u201cEmotionally immature\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t love him\u201d\n\u201cBreak up with him\u201d\n\u201cDelusional woman\u201d\n\nJFC, calm down. This is a situation that can very easily be mended with better communication from both parties. You all are slinging rather hurtful insults about a stranger that you don\u2019t know, while moral grandstanding about how she shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions. You are all jumping to conclusions about a relationship you are not in, about someone you don\u2019t know. I understand wanting to be \u201cright\u201d, but holding someone to fire because of your own emotions regarding the subject is not going to solve anything. Telling someone to break up or that they don\u2019t actually love their partner, when it\u2019s a situation that can be resolved with communication, is horrible advice. Relationships take work. They are not all sunshine & rainbows.

He acted suspiciously so he was doing something he didn\u2019t want you to know or see. At the very least have your radar up.
