I tend to tilt my screen away often as an automatic reaction. I'm 37 and I have never cheated in person or online. \n\nMaybe he was looking at porn or something and was embarrassed. \n\nI'm going YTA. People deserve privacy. You said you trust him. If there is trust, there is room to respect privacy.", "YTA. You admit you have no reason to believe he was cheating, so why all the suspicion? He wants to keep something private from you knowing that you'll just explode at him and accuse him of ridiculousness anyway? It sounds like he can't win here. I feel bad for the guy.", "YTA.\n\nEither you trust him or you don't.  He's allowed to be private about whatever he was or wasn't doing, it's his phone.  If you don't trust him just break up already.", "These situations are tricky. On one hand, it\u2019s not cool to ask why he hid his screen (assuming he even did) if you hadn\u2019t any reason to be suspicious. On the other hand, if he has nothing to hide he would have been open about showing you what he was looking at. \n\nThe only real options are 1) he was looking for a present for you, 2) he was talking to someone he didn\u2019t want you to know about, or 3) he was searching what to do about hemorrhoids or something. \n\nBut I\u2019m inclined to say ESH", "YTA - Trying to restrict his communication with his friends.\n\n>the people he speaks to that im not on good terms with\n\nEven when he's alone, he got to worry about you sneaking around and insulting him for to talking to people.  Not good at all.", "Dude, YTA. You also need to grow up and let go of your insecurities. He doesn\u2019t need to explain anything to you, he obviously cares enough to go back and have a conversation with you. You are acting like a child and should apologize to him. If you can\u2019t trust him, then why are you even in a relationship??", "YTA for insisting.\n\nYou say you trust him but your actions say otherwise. You\u2019re oddly insistent over the pettiest of things (whether or not he admits his behavior was suspicious). You said in a comment that there are private things you don\u2019t tell each other but then in another comment you declare he should tell you about things like porn and not keep things from you. You say you don\u2019t think he would cheat but then imply this kind of behavior might lead you to think he is cheating in the future.\n\nWhat exactly do you want out of this situation? It sounds like at this point it is just an argument out of pride. You want to be right and you want him to concede and agree with you so that you can be. Do you trust him or not? Are you able to let this one suspicious incident go or not? Do you need him to tell you everything before you can trust him, or is he allowed to have some things he doesn\u2019t tell you?\n\nWhy do you want to stay together? I mean, you two were already on cool terms from a previous argument and then got into another one. This doesn\u2019t seem like the most stable or understanding relationship. You two really need to learn some communication skills if you don\u2019t want your relationship to just be a miserable emotional rollercoaster.", "YTA the spectrum of embarrassing shit to google is insanely vast. Or maybe the poor lad just had a random urge to find out where his elementary school classmates are in life now, but you sound like the type to freak out over seeing a random female face on the screen.", "Always trust your gut.", "Yta. It\u2019s none of your business what he was doing. If you trust him, leave it alone. Ffs.", "Going against the grain here to say NTA.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never hidden things from my significant other and we\u2019ve never been aggro when it comes to protecting our phones. It is slightly sus that he turned the screen away from you, notably closed out of whatever he was doing, and lied that he wasn\u2019t doing anything (when it was clear he was doing something). While not indicative of cheating, it is strange behavior and you have the right to be in your feelings about the interaction. Maybe he was doing something you wouldn\u2019t approve of, or maybe he was planning a surprise for you and didn\u2019t want it to be spoiled. Who knows! Just communicate your feelings to him, listen to his side of things, have a talk about it. It certainly isn\u2019t anything to worry about unless it becomes a repeated offense paired with increasingly strange behavior. Things might be weird because of your previous argument the night before, too! So maybe start with that and communicate effectively, get all those bundled up feels out, and apologize where apologies are due. Hope the best for you two. \u2661", "YTA\n\nYou didn't approach him accusing him of cheating; however, the way that you asked him who he was talking to, definitely came off that you were already suspicious of him for something... hence why he was probably so quick to become defensive with you.\n\nYou don't trust him, and it really showed when you came up to him already defensive/accusatory. Everyone has a right to alone time and privacy. It doesn't always have to mean that they're being sneaky. I'm sorry that's something you're worried about\u2013 it could be helpful to do some self-reflection to understand better why you are so distrusting of him, and if it continues to be a source of anxiety and harm your relationship, maybe it's time to move on.\n\nIf you're worried he's talking to people you aren't on good terms with, and he knows you're not on good terms with them... that's something the two of you need to navigate. This post sounds like there are some deeper communicative issues you two need to work through together.", "You are not the AH\u2026i was in a similar situation few years back where i thought it was funny my then BF had started hiding his screen and he tried to make it deem like i was being delusional. Turns out i was right. He was cheating.", "NTA, don't let these reddit idiots gaslight you. He hid his phone screen for a reason I am sure. Ask him if he minds you using his phone for a bit and see if he gets nervous. In an iPhone go into the photos app and see if he has any hidden photos, youtube how to find where they are. There is the same thing on android. Does he have any weird messaging apps? I would wager my left nut he is up to something not good. I used to run a investigation business and have seen it all, I got paid for finding information like this out and helped hundreds of clients find what they needed to know though various methods. He showed you his tabs because he was in private browsing mode so he closed it quickly and it would not show up on his history. If you have access to your home router there are ways you can log connections, it won't tell you exactly what he is doing but it could indicate what websites he is going to, like if you and him are the only ones on the router and it is connecting to [Tinder.com](https://Tinder.com) that gives you a clue. Another thing you can do is go to popular dating apps and say you forgot your password and if it asks for a phone number enter his number because it will send his phone a text if he is in their system. Ahh reddit is going to hate me for this entire comment but there are so many ways you can investigate this and don't let this guy gas light you and call you names for being suspicious. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT when it goes off like that don't listen to random strangers on reddit who know nothing. THis is the age of cheating. Not saying he 100% was cheating but at the very least up to something like watching porn but since he wasn't jerking at the time probably fucking around. Look into this.", "honestly i do believe him when he says he wasnt doing anything wrong, but i think it was something private that he didn't want to involve me in. all i wanted was an explanation for purposely hiding the phone from me, as theres no logical reason anyone would do this unless they didn't want what they were doing to be seen. i dont have trust issues with him and im not going to leave him over something so insignificant.", "YTA- for all you know he could've been buying you an apology gift.

Lol", "he doesnt have money to buy me a gift so that couldnt be it. im over it now and dont suspect anything serious was going on. i wish he would see my side that it was weird behavior and he could have just said it was private instead of pretending he didnt do it at all.", "how am i sneaking around? how am i insulting him? what are you even talking about", "This was my exact issue with your post. No big to casually ask who your partner is talking to, what they\u2019re looking at, etc. What is an issue is that it sounds like he isn\u2019t allowed to talk to people you don\u2019t like. Very much YTA for that.", "he does have a right to explain things to me as im his girlfriend and there should be no secrets unless its strictly private. im open with him about everything and he could watch me on my phone at any time because i have nothing to hide. bringing up secretive behavior is not childish, its called open communication which many people lack these days. i admit i went a bit overboard on the assumptions, but i dont regret bringing up something that bothered me.", "This is an excellent response. \n\nThe whole ordeal reeks of emotional immaturity. I wonder how old OP and the BF are. If they're under 24 this may be the first real situation OP has had navigating adult relationships in this way. The need to be right is also something that causes more issues when you are young. I'm not excusing OP\u2019s behavior but I'm curious if it can be chalked up to inexperience and emotional immaturity or simply the latter.", "i agree with this. im not pressuring him about it further because i simply have no proof anything happened. i was only upset he turned his phone away and then proceeded to deny it even happening. that would get old fast for anyone. people dont do that unless theres a reason; i couldn't imagine myself doing that if i had nothing to hide. this alone made it hard to understand his side since he gave no explanation as to what he was being secretive for.", "Then calm tf down. He\u2019s entitled to privacy. You seem rather unstable.", "If you haven\u2019t ever seen him hide things from you before, maybe he really wasn\u2019t doing anything sketchy. My guess is that he really just had his home screen up, and now he\u2019s pissed off since you made a weird accusation. It\u2019s very weird of you to jump to the assumption that he\u2019s trying to hide something from you just because his phone was on the home screen. The guy even let you look at his phone, which he definitely didn\u2019t need to do, and you still continued to accuse him. Then, you threw a fit and went into your room because he wouldn\u2019t tell you he was doing something wrong when he wasn\u2019t. That is not normal behavior.\n\nYTA", "Have you discussed your porn related expectations? This is not something everyone seems to agree on. I have never personally been with anyone that cared about or policed porn consumption, but I have read about the differing opinions on the topic.", "1) You don't know that, and 2) do you think it's reasonable to demand that he tells you what porn he looks at? Sure, if that's something you guys like to talk about, go for it, but saying that's something he shouldn't \"keep from you\" is not a realistic expectation. What exactly did you want him to say? Because from the tone of this post, if he had said, \"Actually I was looking at porn and I don't want to talk about it,\" it sounds like you would have been angry with him regardless.", "Just from your responses to other people on this post of yours, I really don't think you would have let it go.\n\n1. You obviously don't trust him, as evidenced by your post and subsequent replies.\n\n2. You're nosey, given your demands that he tell you what he was looking at.\n\n3. You're insecure, because you implied he's cheating and hounded him about it, therefore putting him on the defensive and reinforcing your belief that he is indeed cheating.\n\n4. You do not respect him.\n\nThat is not how you maintain a relationship. You're young, so I'm telling you now so you can work on yourself. I recommend therapy so you learn to regulate your thoughts and feelings in a neutral, safe environment. I know that therapy is pushed a lot around here, and that's because a whole big bunch of us spent a long time sabotaging ourselves and our relationships with others before getting help.", "thats debatable. there are traumatic things i will never tell a soul, and he has kept things to himself as well. we dont go through each others phones or computers, and we dont know each others passwords because its just unnecessary. i felt something was off by him hiding what he was doing, and he denied even doing it which is what upset me. he had never done this before so it caught me completely off guard.", "It's one of the most vague accusations as well. He probably got defensive because he wasn't doing anything and OP is acting unhinged.", "You're a girlfriend, I think You're overstating your importance here. Just because you're together doesn't give you unilateral control over his life and he has a right to privacy without being pressured by your insecurities. And by the way, YTA.", "Of course! You are completely valid in how you feel about the interaction, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. I am of the same belief that if there isn\u2019t anything to hide, you wouldn\u2019t hide said thing. That being said, please sit down with him to have a talk when you are mentally able to bear a heavy conversation. You both need to take a minute to communicate all these feelings, because healthy relationships take a whole lotta work. I hope you\u2019ll come out of that future convo with a better understanding of each other and a stronger foundation. \u2661 \u2661 \u2661", "Again: you either trust him or you don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with him. He deserves privacy. He deserves not being interrogated when he doesn\u2019t want to share a thing with you. He gets to be embarrassed and make stupid excuses. He gets to have an inner life, and have friends of any gender, as well as confidentiality with any/all of them.\n\nIf he does something wrong, act accordingly. But when he does something minor that you don\u2019t understand, simply make a mental note of it and move on. *Perhaps* it\u2019s a pale yellow flag. There\u2019s really no way of knowing if it\u2019s anything worth thinking about, unless you see an actual red flag. But if you live your life like this, being so deeply suspicious of a ridiculously minor thing like not being included in his every thought\u2026you\u2019re gonna make both of you miserable, and you\u2019re gonna drive him away. \n\nYou went accusatory right out of the gate, and it signifies deep, *deep* insecurity. Work on that. And like, I\u2019m not even saying there is zero percent chance he\u2019s cheating! Some dudes are dogs, manipulators, and gaslighters. Your job is to trust your own judgement of character. But this alone? No. This ain\u2019t it. You went full tilt over nothing. YTA", "Agreed. She\u2019s actually mad at him because she couldn\u2019t coerce a confession for something he didn\u2019t even do to begin with? It\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019d be pissed off too. What an AH"]}
