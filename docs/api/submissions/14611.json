You want her to be triply exhausted from the long travel times with a toddler, while breastfeeding, AND while pregnant all at once.  It sounds miserable.  It's entirely possible she wouldn't be able to recover enough from the travel to enjoy the visit once you all are there.  She's going to need a vacation from the vacation once you get back home.\n\nI'm going with a soft YTA because it's very understandable that you want to see your elderly grandparents as soon as possible, but it might just not be feasible under these conditions.", "2 days travelling with a layover is exhausting for most people, let alone trying to keep a 2 year old happy.

It could even damage the baby with the levels of stress your wife would be under. The hard part for you is to  come to terms with not bringing them and not resenting that. I am sorry you are in that position.  I used to take my 2 year old 6000 miles. It is really hard and wiped me out for weeks.", "YTA. Go visit your grandparents alone and have a proper, long goodbye visit. They aren't going to be able to really bond with a jet-lagged two year old and it's really their relationship with you that is going to matter at this point.

You literally listed 6 reasons not to go and then added like 2 more in context. \n\nI get it, they're your grandparents.

And you also acknowledge that all the reasons she has given are absolutely valid and the trip would be a massive undertaking for your wife and child - I think you know it's a bad idea, you just have an understandably sentimental picture in your mind of how it should be. You're not an asshole for that, far from it. Perhaps you could fly to see them and do some video links to your wife and baby while you're there?

If you\u2019re going to regret it for the rest of your life if your grandparents don\u2019t get to see your child, that\u2019s a good enough reason to do it. Some things are just necessary. I\u2019m sure if you explain that to your wife she will get on board. \n\nBut you need to schedule time off work to do more childcare before and after the trip to help her recover, and spring for business class if you can.", "INFO: Am I right in my reading of this that she is prioritising seeing her parents over yours (along with your grandparents)?

Yours doesn't count? Just go", "Be clear on whose interests it serves to make this trip.\nYour 2 year old isn\u2019t going to get much out of this- you are doing this for yourself and for your 90yo grandparents. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that though, but just be aware. \nMy grandparents died when i was 2, 3, and 5 yo. I was in close contact with all of them, but I have no memories of any of them.\nThe fact I never met my grandparents does not bother me BUT Im sure that my parents are happy that we met.\nIMO Meeting a baby once does not necessarily equate to having a meaningful relationship between grandparent and grandchild. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nBreastfeeding while potentially pregnant while caring for a toddler travelling for 2 days is a massive undertaking. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to make her do this trip unless SHE wanted to. Going alone or going with the 2yo with you and leaving the wife at home would be a fair compromise.\nYTA if you make her travel with you", "NTA for asking, but you would be if you told.  This is along trip, with a 2yo, and would be especially worse if your wife was pregnant at the time as well. \n\nI understand time is running short, but sometimes its just not the right time.", "YTA. Visit them alone. Also if she would be pregnant, she\u2019s going to be exhausted all the time, while taking care of the baby and breastfeeding. That sounds awful. Also what will your child gain from the trip?", "I'm going with a soft YTA. It's not an AH move to want to see your grandparents but like others have said, your 2 yo might not even remember. Also with a potentially pregnant wife, no. Pregnancy is exhausting, and even if her first pregnancy was totally fine, no one knows how much the second will affect her. Also, food for thought, how much of the administrative work will be done by you completely? How much of the child watching will be done by you? How much of the packing and organizing will be done by you? I have found that even in the most balanced of relationships someone takes the lead (and unfortunately it's usually the wife). If you can confidently say that you do all of the administrative tasks, all of the packing, all of the organizing and details and will be on call if she needs to pass the toddler along, then yes, maybe push a little harder for this trip. But if that's not something you can do then go by yourself. Make those memories with your grandparents, show them videos and pictures. But don't drag your (potentially pregnant) wife, and toddler along. Good luck!", "INFO: why can\u2019t you just take your 2 year old and your wife stay home?", "NAH but try to put some perspective on this. The babies won\u2019t remember the trip. The grandparents whilst they may be disappointed to not meet their grandchild, also don\u2019t know them, so they\u2019re not going to have the same bond you have with them for example, or local grandkids. It would be an introduction before never seeing them again. So the person most likely to be feeling feelings in this is you. And you are asking a lot from your wife to accommodate your feelings. So I guess you need to decide just how important it is to you in the context that it is about you.", "As long as you're both taking care of the 2yo on this trip: nta.", "NAH  \n\n\nIt's a tough situation, because I'm sure your grandparents would love to meet their grandchild. However, it is also a huge commitment to travel that far with a toddler.", "NAH, but you would TA if you tried to force it. Go yourself for a proper goodbye.", "NTA. I hope she doesn't plan on flying with your toddler to see her family. If she's worried about being pregnant, then stop trying until after the trip. Also, she can't be that bothered about 2 year olds sleep, if she's OK with the still waking in the night to breastfeed. In fact she could feed the toddler on the plane if they get fussy. People travel all the time with kids. It might not be the most pleasant experience, but kids adapt pretty quickly.\n\nYour grandparents want to meet their great grandchild and won't get many opportunities too. If your wife doesn't want to go then you could take the child yourself. But then I suspect she would have an issue with that too.", "Go yourself, get the grandparents and bring them to your wife&kid. Money doesn't seem a problem, so just do this and everyone is happy.

Close enough to 'helpfully' make suggestions, but not close enough to HELP. \n\nI was judged by all the relatives. No help was offered. They hid my son's pacifier (first time round) when my ex FINALLY took me out for a few minutes at night with just him, so I could get a breather away from all the people whose language I did not speak. We were gone maybe forty min, we could hear him screaming from down the block. His pacifier was in a corner of the drawer they swore it was not in. Again, judged for them not being able to find it, let alone him still being on one, when their own kids had the same. fuck 'em. \n\nIf I knew then, what I knew after? I'd have taken a sudden trip to some made up 'friends' and come back to my own home after he left. SCREW ALL OF THAT. The plane, the weather, the undrinkable water, the racist relatives, the almost inedible food (people thought it was fun to give me 'authentic' food, which meant no actual spices, just chili powder) just...everything. \n\nNot to mention all the lies told about how he'd be different this time and actually help, and how unhelpful all his relatives were. NOPE. By the time I left, my back was bent for months, because my daughter got sick ONCE and then refused to walk the rest of the trip. \n\nI had no insurance, so no chiropractor for me. It took WEEKS for my back to straighten, I was in agony for months after that (we were there almost five months and girl was HEAVY)\n\nThat trip really led to me hating him.\n\nNEVER AGAIN.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a hard trip. I have had to do long flights with my kids when they were younger by myself. But that\u2019s the price we pay for living far away from family we\u2019re close to.\n\nIf you can wean the 2 year old before then or get her to take bottles that would help your wife as you could do feeds while she sleeps. You can each take turns giving the other a chance to rest.

Don\u2019t inconvenience other people by forcing them to do it.", "NTA.  1) Baby needs to be weaned off the breast.  It's more about comfort than nutrition now.  2) you need to consider slightly delaying a 2nd baby:  weaning oldest is priority and there will be a regression period.  3) sleep disruption will happen but can be fixed.  4) how will you feel in 5/10 years?  Baby won't remember a thing but you will have pictures and memories you can share with Baby.  My regret will always be not having my children meet their great-grandparents (travel restrictions for the 'event' for the last several years).

It will probably be stressful and exhausting but it sounds like it would mean a lot to you", "Take kid yourself and give wife a break", "NAH as I understand your point of view, but I am nonetheless agreeing with your wife with one extra datapoint - the 2yo, who will not be consulted for this decision, 100% doesn\u2019t want to go.

Your 2 year old is unlikely to remember much of the experience. It is not fair to ask your wife to travel pregnant and deal with everything that comes along with a cranky kid.", "YTA. Traveling with a 2 y/o even for two hours by plane can be a nightmare, and the mother usually bears the most parental burden.\n\nAlso, 90 year olds do not generally make good babysitters and expecting them to do the job even for part of one day may be hazardous to your kid's health or even theirs. Some years back, my s/o and I flew with our two kids 9 hours to Hawaii to visit my elderly parents. During the visit, my s/o and I made a 2-night visit to another island, leaving the kids with the grandparents, who both seemed eager to oblige. We ended up spending a night in ER because Dad's heart condition flared up from too much stress.", "How far is the other side of the world. I flew Australia to Europe and back with two toddlers multiple times. It never took two days each way. NAH.", "YTA YIKES", "NAH, I get why she's not excited by the prospect.

I'm sad she never got to meet her only great grandchild, and that I was too far away to see her after November.", "NAH. I\u2019m forever in the same boat but it was certainly harder when the kids were small. My husband did fly from Toronto to Melbourne with a 1.5 and 3 year old and it was exhausting. I didn\u2019t go because I couldn\u2019t but then I also wasn\u2019t breastfeeding, which throws a wrench in everything for you. \n\nYour grandparents will get something out of meeting your child but your wife is right to be worried about the travel. Could you fly to the first layover spot, spend a couple days, fly the rest of the way and do the reverse on the way back? (Like let\u2019s say you\u2019re in the U.K. and need to go to New Zealand - could you take 2-3 days in Dubai to relax?).", "It is highly unusual for a toddler to still breastfeed. Technically mums can breastfeed for as long as they want but with a potential newborn on the way, it may be advised to wean your toddler. It also saves a lot of hassle when it comes to sleeping. Even my 6 month old doesn't need feeding at night because the milk keeps her full for longer. \n\nAs for the trip: it is possible if you wean your child and plan thoroughly so your little one doesn't get bored. It's also important that she doesn't get overwhelmed. Airports are full of people, advertisement, loud announcements and all that stuff. Make sure she gets the opportunity to rest, shut off, have some quiet time. And try to stay with her and give her a feeling of safety. And if she throws a tantrum or get anxious, have plans to deal with that. If you have time you could \"practice\" before the trip. Maybe take her on a day trip to a zoo or something. Or take a train ride somewhere. To test the waters so to speak.\n\nMy husband and I have done day trips when our daughter was a month old and it worked out well. My advise would be, try it out and if it doesn't work, then that's how it is. When you have children, you have to sacrifice some things in your life.", "NTA. As someone who travels around 15 to 20 hours to go back to my country since our first was 3 months and our youngest was 6 months, I don\u2019t feel like the trip is a problem. We are lucky enough that both me and my husband are originally from the same city, so all the family is there, but I have travelled solo with just one and both of them, and it\u2019s doable, especially if you get help once you arrive. \n\nI was going for a N.A.H.
