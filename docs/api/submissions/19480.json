She still stole and has been harassing you regardless", "One is *never* an AH for wanting/having someone/anyone who has stolen from or hurt you held accountable. Them having a problem of some sort/any sort is not a get out of jail free card to do whatever they want.", "NTA\n\nYou need a police report for no other reason than to have a record of it. Whether it goes anywhere in the legal system or not isn\u2019t as important as having a file on her. This woman threatened you physically aside from the theft and lies. Get these incidents on a police report. If she\u2019d do this once, she\u2019ll do it again and there\u2019s no telling how that might go.", "Right?! The theft was in 2021 though; but I\u2019m still dealing with the DV charge since I forgot to remove it until a future employer asked about it. Hopefully there isn\u2019t a time hack on filing since I have proof.", "Exactly. People who use the sympathy card to abuse others are trifling.", "Right, idc if it\u2019s from a while back; theft is theft.", "Genuinely. I only feel bad for the kid. And she uses him as a pawn to get sympathy from people to help her. When she stole an old phone of mine and I found out; she blamed him and threatened to beat him for it. A horrible person and Mother.", "get a restraining order", "According to her, none of this would have happened if I didn\u2019t \u201ccheat\u201d on her since we were in a \u201ccommitted relationship.\u201d We didn\u2019t even have a picture together.", "Definitely. Thought she was my friend, and the sex was happenstance since we were around each other so often. Nope. Completely calculated. Started saying \u201cour house\u201d because I was charging her rent. When I said no to anymore sex she went ballistic.", "They gave me my money back! Thank goodness; the old DV charge came up when I needed a background check for a new job and it made me upset all over again. If she\u2019s not going to get in trouble for filing a false police report, it\u2019d make me feel better that there\u2019s theft attached to her. My lawyer said I could sue for defamation, but she\u2019s not worth all of that. If they call me up after I file; I\u2019ll just show the bank statement and her texts blaming her nephews.", "Getting charges in place will also serve to show who the criminal is.  She may not be done with you.  After getting arrested you have leverage against her lies or she may move on to the next victim.  Abusers don't stop until they're stopped.  They want to act that way.", "Then report her and start the ball rolling to *get the kid away from her*.", "I tried and went to two police stations and they said because we weren\u2019t physically violent, I\u2019d have to go get help somewhere else. No one cared about the abuse I was going through until she filed the false charges. :( just two \u201cemotional women\u201d", "A committed relationship takes two parties to agree to be exclusive. Not a few convenient one night stands. She is trying to project. As I said, she is wacko. Rather get it on the record. To protect yourself.", "then id let it go... not for her, for you.... not worth the time and effort. Disconnect and have zero contact no katter what.", "Right?! I don\u2019t want her to hurt anyone else; and even though it\u2019s been years I feel like I need that closure. If they ask why I\u2019m bringing it up now, I\u2019ll simply state that I\u2019m still affected by the abuse and have to pay for the false charges to be removed from my background.", "I will.", "I\u2019m on the fence since it\u2019s kind of old; (2021) but if the false charges are following me then I feel like her real charges should be on her record. You don\u2019t play with peoples lives like that.", "I told her the way she behaves is going to get her seriously hurt/dead/in jail. But alas, she\u2019s just a poor victim and everyone does her so wrong.", "Its hard when she stole from ME and I have to pay to get the charges removed. I believe in God and karma, have done therapy, but she smiled in my face about trying to ruin my career and at one point shoved me to the ground when I asked her to leave. It\u2019s hard to get past abuse.", "Feel free to also say, it's to ensure she can't hurt you in the future with manipulative lies.\n\nPlus, she deserves it!  This is what jail is for!  She's not Jean Valjean.", "Indeed. Old charges or not. She could come back at you any time. You have gone to so much expense already, lawyers, protecting your career, etc. Even if nothing comes of it, she needs to be flagged on the system. All the military men and women i know are way too forgiving. You have given enough for your country. You need to take something for you too. If that is only going to be peace of mind that the next guy out there has support when he lays charges against her.  So be it.", "Think of it this way.if the genders were reversed....I can guarantee you would be in prison right now. \n\nWhat is good for the goose....is good for the gander too.", "agreed... but it takes two to tango. the more you ignore her, the more she will be exhausted and stop. Everytime you respond, it will feed her toxic need to provok you for attention.", "Thank you for not telling me to just let it go!! <3 she lied on me, humiliated me, stole from me, and painted me to be an abuser when I simply wanted her to leave me alone. I lost weight and developed insomnia due to the stress. In the words of Denzel Washington, \u201cI\u2019m leaving here with something.\u201d Plus like you said; I don\u2019t want her to play the \u201cwoe is me\u201d role on someone else and they get her abusive wrath as well.", "You\u2019re very right. She even tried the, \u201cI came out to my family for you, so we have to stay together.\u201d I don\u2019t even believe she\u2019s gay; just lonely. \u201cWhat about my Son?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t live without you.\u201d I know it worked in my favor that were both women. And since she would date anyone who gives her any attention; I feel bad if she charges a man with this as well. A big reason why I want it filed.", "She\u2019s blocked on everything; the false charges are just following me.", "Nope. That's what we all are told to do \"let it go\". Sorry. No can do. My mental health is just as important as the person standing next to me. \n\nYou certainly did leave with something. I hope a life lesson to never let another person take you for granted. \n\nYou are worth more than that. \n\nIndeed. Go do it. It will ease your mind In terms of the abuse, knowing you did something constructive about it. You never know, your charges might be the turning point for her to be a better person. (Or not lol). \n\nAs for the weight loss and insomnia...hopefully this will fix itself in time as you work your way through this.", "She did not \"come out\" to anybody. She used you and took complete advantage that you would do \"nothing\" (military manners). Her kid is not your responsibility. Maybe losing the kid to the system will shake some sense into her. Who knows these days.", "Thank you, I genuinely appreciate your input. Even if it\u2019s old, I need to do it to ease my mind. People like that need to be exposed for the monsters they truly are.", "I dont get it. she didnt show in court and YOU have to pay for anything? US is a strsnge place, sorry. NTA. I would file a report", "Charges will do nothing in this case, plus it's unlikely you can successfully lay charges anyway. Your account details were in her account, this happened years ago and you received the money back, so it'll just be treated as a mistake (possibly even your fault because you left your information there). She even claimed it was \"her nephews\". No charges will be successful here and you'll just be opening up another thing for her to harass you over. People telling you to go for it aren't being realistic.", "Gotta disagree. I don\u2019t care if the charges don\u2019t go through; I just want her being a thief to be documented just like me being \u201can abuser\u201d is. Only if we go to court will the date get brought up, which once again doesn\u2019t matter. Simply filing a report saying she stole money is enough for me. Her background doesn\u2019t deserve to be clean and she also should have to explain her charges when housing/jobs ask about it. I don\u2019t expect money; I want closure.", "Also; if she was in the care of her \u201cnephews,\u201d knew they did it and didn\u2019t alert me she\u2019d be the adult responsible either way. It\u2019s an already documented investigation from the bank that it was her account. Plus, her sister will prove that she wasn\u2019t anywhere near her nephews when the theft happened. She\u2019s just an idiot."]}
