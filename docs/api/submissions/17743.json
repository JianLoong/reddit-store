They're adults and can make up their own minds. As long as you're not actively speaking against her, you can't be faulted for no longer pushing them.", "You are trying to be the bigger person, but you went way, way too far in the opposite direction. If I understand correctly, all your children are adults. You should have stopped pushing them a very long time ago; in fact, you were something of an asshole to keep doing it for so long.", "NTA - Let your ex wife enjoy eating out of the shit pot she created when she walked out of your kids lives.  She created the situation, she needs to be willing to live with the consequences.\n\nIf you keep pushing you might damage your own relationship with your kids.", "NTA. You remind me of my dad. Even after they separated he\u2019d push us to stay in contact with mum. If she did something to upset us, he\u2019d be pushing us to forgive her, all while trying to undermine our relationship with him at the same time. His actions negatively impacted our relationship with him. Stop before your actions start to negatively impact your relationship with you. \n\nThey\u2019re adults. They can decide what relationship they want or don\u2019t want with their mother. Focus on your relationship with them and leave the rest alone.", "YWBTA\n\njust let them be. they've made their decision about their mother. and quite honestly, it's justified. I mean...what kind of person walks on on their kids at Christmas?", "NTA, but you've spent a long time essentially trying to force a relationship where there isn't one. I'd be irritated if my mother walked out on me and my other parent basically pushed me to do all the emotional and physical labor  of maintaining a relationship. \n\nYou guilted your children into arranging a Mother's Day brunch for a mother who abandoned them. I think you probably owe them all an apology for what you've been doing not just \"stopping\" what you shouldn't have been doing in the first place.", "NTA, they are old enough to make their own decisions about how much contact they have with her and there is no need for you to interfere with that.", "NTA. It\u2019s up to your adult children whether they want a relationship with their mother. It\u2019s not your responsibility anymore. You are a good man.", "NTA. For whose benefit are you doing this pushing? Your kids feel invalidated by it because it ignores their feelings, and it's creating conflict in the only parental relationship they have. Let it go.", "Nta , I didn\u2019t even read the story. IFBYOU PUSH THE ISSUE THEY WILL GROW TO RESENT YOU", "NTA. They are adults. They've made their decisions. You need to respect them and their decisions. This is out of your hands as it should be. If you keep pushing them, soon they will be pushing you away along with pushing away from their mother. Don't do that. Don't drive them to do that. Let them be.", "NTA. Your kids are old enough to make their own decisions pertaining to their estranged mom. Step back let them decide how much or how little contact they want.", "NTA but you WOULD be an asshole if you kept pushing. They have told you again and again they don't want that. You not respecting their boundaries is what makes you the asshole.\n\nYou, however, dropping it because they are adults and know how much contact they want with their mother IS the right thing to do. You owe her nothing.\n\nYou are not treating them as adults if you keep persisting in them having a relationship with someone who abandoned them.", "NTA, in fact the opposite. If you continue in the habits you've been doing, you might be an asshole. They are adults, they can choose for themselves. You should be a source of emotional support for them first and foremost. Trust them to make the decisions right for them.", ">\" They don't need my help.\"\n\nHow are you *helping*? You're meddling.

I think you were not wrong to *encourage* them to keep contact when they were young (and full marks for not *forcing* them to), and I think you would be wrong to push it now. You're handling this just right.\n\n\n\nYWNBTA", "OP YWNBTA. Your kids are adults and they can decide for themselves whether they want a relationship with her or not at all. So the right thing to do is just leave them be and let them decide what is right for themselves", "NTA - you can carry on joy bad mouthing them but there\u2019s no need to spend energy encouraging them or taking steps to ensure that they have a relationship now - they\u2019re more than old enough themselves.", "NTA but time to leave it alone. You're kids are actually adults and are capable of deciding what type of relationships they want and with who.\n\nI feel you, I went through this with my youngest and I have to tell you the relief I felt that as an adult they don't need me to manage their personal lives is priceless.\n\nIt's on their mother if there is something left to fix with your kids. Let go.", "YWNBTA. The recent conversation with your kid is a sign of that. \n\nIt is also a sign that this is no longer about your *adult* childrens realtionships with their mother. It is now about their relationship with **you**.\n\nThat if you don't stop with the pushing, you will find them starting to dial back their relationship with you.\n\nYour kid may have been overtly asking if you understood how their mother was and if you'd support them. But in the back of their mind, the question may have been as much \"am I going to have to cut down my contact with you too?\"\n\nAnd after your own description of your own behavior leading up to Mothers Day, I can certainly understand why they might be questioning that. Seriously, go back and re-read what you wrote, and think about the questions you kid was asking in context of it.\n\nIn the end, your children are adults. Their mother is no longer in a relationship with you. There is nothing to indicate that you have any further obligation to ensure or facilitate a relationship between them and her. Stop trying and let them manage their relationship or lack of it as they choose.\n\nIf your ex has a problem with it, just point her at them and let them work it out between themselves.", "YTA - you do not have their backs.  You push them to have a relationship with someone they do not want to have a relationship with. \n\nINFO:   What do you get out of this?", "YTA for pushing it until now."]}
