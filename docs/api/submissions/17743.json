At that time my two youngest were still living at home, and my youngest was in Highschool.\n\nI have a mostly good relationship with my kids.  My eldest has lived in a distant city for a long time now, so its mostly a long-distance relationship.  Two still live with me, and another is staying whilst renovating their home, with which I'm helping.\n\nEver since our split, I have always pushed my kids to maintain relationships with their mother.  Mostly they don't.  When I push the issue, I get responses such as \"she doesn't care about me, so why should I bother?\"  At least one of my kids has completely cut off contact with their mother, describing her as \"batshit crazy\"  and has come to the conclusion (without any prompting) that their mother suffers from a Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\n\nI pushed them to do something with her at Christmas, but nothing happened.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Mothers' day, I repeatedly told my kids that they needed to arrange something for Mothers' Day.  I got either pushback or indifference in response, but finally one of them reached out to her and arranged a Brunch that some of them went to.\n\nTo be honest, I'm just over it.  They are all adults, they don't need by help, and I'm honestly a bit fed up with it.  I feel that from now on I should just shut up about it, and leave it to them to remember and decide if they want to do anything with her.\n\nBut also, in the recent conversation my child seemed concerned that I would not support them.  That somehow I was not aware of their mother's NPD.  I had to assure them that I understood.  I have never \"bad-mouthed\" my ex, I've never had to, but I also don't want to be seen to be defending her.\n\nSo if I just shut up from now on, and stop pushing them to have a relationship with their mother, WIBTA?\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust to clarify something:  My youngest was in his penultimate years of highschool when she walked out.  He's an adult, but he has ASD.  He can't really understand why she left, these kinds of things just don't compute to him.  He still loves his mum, and I don't have a problem with that. \n\nFor him, it's more a \"reminder\" than a push, just like I remind him about a lot of other stuff.  I suppose that in part I have pushed his siblings, because I wanted him to have some support.

It is now about their relationship with **you**.\n\nThat if you don't stop with the pushing, you will find them starting to dial back their relationship with you.\n\nYour kid may have been overtly asking if you understood how their mother was and if you'd support them. But in the back of their mind, the question may have been as much \"am I going to have to cut down my contact with you too?\"\n\nAnd after your own description of your own behavior leading up to Mothers Day, I can certainly understand why they might be questioning that. Seriously, go back and re-read what you wrote, and think about the questions you kid was asking in context of it.\n\nIn the end, your children are adults. Their mother is no longer in a relationship with you. There is nothing to indicate that you have any further obligation to ensure or facilitate a relationship between them and her. Stop trying and let them manage their relationship or lack of it as they choose.\n\nIf your ex has a problem with it, just point her at them and let them work it out between themselves.", "YTA - you do not have their backs.

If your ex wants a relationship with her children, she should demonstrate that she cares about them.  \nMy family resents that my children didn't cater to my mother, their grandmother.  But she never once reached out to them, not a card, not a few bucks, not a phone call.  Other grandkids who lived near her, she catered to.  One of them even lived with her for a bit. If we visited, she found a way to make demeaning comments that were supposed to be \"kidding.\"  It was never appreciated by any of us.\n\nMy father sent them cash for Christmas every year, there were 13 grandchildren in all, and he never missed one of them.  And it was ridiculous how much all of the kids looked forward to that $20 bucks.  My kids were very fond of their grandfather, and my mother they had no use for.\n\nYou reap what you sow.  Going forward, pushing your kids toward their mom will only come back on you.  Just let things take their course and don't interfere.", "YWNBTA, drop it. Like she did them", "NTA.  You gave your opinion so drop it.  They only have one parent and deserve your support with that decision.", "YTA for how you've been pushing all this time.\nYWNBTA if you were to stop pushing going forward. Your kids were grown when she left, and they are grown now. They know what's going on, they know what's best for them, and what they need and want to do pertaining to THEIR lives. If they choose to not associate with someone who clearly showed she doesn't care for them, then they have every right to not want to associate with that person. Your kids are showing great healthy emotional growth that is rare in young adults their age; this is something for which you should be proud of them. But, a couple of things that don't make sense to me regarding your post:\n1) How do you know she does not have Narcissistic Personality Disorder? Are you basing this off of her not ever telling you? I hate to tell you, but based on your description of her, she most certainly does have the traits of it. I dated a man with this condition, and had an employee with it. Your kids are right about that. It's possible she told them at some point that she has it, or they maybe did research on it. You said there was no prompting them saying this, I guess based on before she left? I don't think that's true. I think that you lived in a mental bubble that prevented you from seeing her major flaws, and the kids were able to see it because they were never part of that bubble; they were able to see the truth outside of it. When we love people so much, we don't see the whole picture, only the good parts and what we want to see. Your kids have always been able to see the whole picture, and it sounds like you are unable to even now.\n2) How does your kids maintaining a relationship with the woman who left them benefit you? What are getting out of them doing this? It honestly doesn't sound like this is for them, it sounds like this is for you. They've told you they don't want this relationship with her, they've told you how uncomfortable it makes them, but you keep pushing and pushing and get UPSET that they don't. What your one kid said is true, you don't value their feelings. This is all about you. But why? Are you trying to vicariously have a relationship with your ex through them? Do you still love your ex? Actually....does your ex even want to still have a relationship with her kids? Or, is this all a \"I just want everyone to get along\" type thing? None of these things are healthy. You need to listen to your kids, respect what they want or don't want regarding their mother. Their relationship with her literally has nothing to do with you. If YOU want to still maintain a relationship with her somehow, that's for you and her to decide, but don't use your kids. \nStop pushing, please. Value their feelings, respect their wishes and decisions. It's their lives.\nBest of luck", "YTA for not having dropped the issue before now. they have made it clear how they feel about their mother, so you should follow through and let them be. continuing to push will actually have negative consequences for your own relationship with them.", "YWNBTA - my dad tried for years to get me to have a relationship with my mother, whom I refer to by her name. \n\nThe TLDR is it didn\u2019t work.", "Gentle Y-T-A but only for pushing as hard as you have for as long as you have.
