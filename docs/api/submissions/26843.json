For almost two years now they have been up my butt about playing or watching TV with them or sitting with them and trying to engage with them more so they know I'm their big brother who will always look out for them. That is not something I want to do and never has been. Their pestering got so bad that I asked my dad if I could move in with my grandparents or my uncle. After that we went to group therapy together.\n\nFor a few months now we have been going around in circles. They want me to be more involved with the kids and play more of a brotherly role in their lives. Dina said the kids already look up to me and I should be making more of an effort because they are only this little (4, 3 and 7 months) once. She also said that her kids deserve more than for me to be indifferent to them. I have been asked why I don't want to be closer to them and I said I see them more as dad's kids with someone other than mom and not really siblings. I was asked if I wanted to change that and I said no and I had no plans to try and change that. We kept circling back around the same topics. So then my dad asked why I wanted to leave so bad. I told him I knew they would not let up on trying to force me to be more involved and I know he would also try and change how I feel.\n\nIt was the next session where they asked if I even loved my half siblings and I decided brutal honesty was maybe the only way to get what I wanted. So I did just that. I said no, I don't love them, I'm indifferent to them. I made it clear I don't hate or dislike them but I have no interest in changing how I feel. I will forever be indifferent. I won't be a dick to them but I won't ever be the brother to them they want me to be. Dina's reaction was as I expected it to be. She was saying I should just go to live with my family then and leave her kids alone because I would break their hearts and not even care.\n\nIt was only afterward my dad was on me for doing what I did to get what I want. He said he knows I held back the last few months because I thought they would give in faster and he said it's an asshole thing to want to leave so badly that I would hurt both of their feelings like that, whether it was in therapy or not.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694695596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ihiut/aita_for_being_more_brutally_honest_to_get_what_i/", "score": 353, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They loved their stepparents, were made to feel included and heard throughout their half-siblings coming along, and given lots of space to do their own things and time alone with their parents. So when they bonded with the little ones, it was in their own time and at their own pace.\n\nThe issue here, I think, is in forcing him to feel something that he just . . . doesn't, and not hearing what he's telling them.

A parent interfering, because they have another dream of What the relationship should be, risk ruining the potential for *any* kind of relationship in the future.\n\nI\u2019ve been there, with my older siblings. It came to a complete head when I reached my teen years, that I refused to speak to my older siblings for almost a year. It took my mom butting 1000% out of it, for us to rebuild a relationship that fits *us*, the kids, the siblings.

They're 4, 3, and 7 months. I don't think that OP not sitting with them or watching TV (*Miss Rachel, maybe?*) let alone moving out is going to rock their world and damage them emotionally.

Please tell you dad that their only hope of you haveing feelings for your siblings was to let it happen organically.

Trust me when I say that EVERYONE looks back and knows that as a teen, their were dumb in a lot of ways. And one day you will realize that they really are your siblings and who knows, you may need help one day and they may be the only ones who could help you and now its not an option because whether you want to admit it or not, you parents cause you to hate them, it was not a decision you \"just made\" and your immaturity is what kept them from being a part of your family.", "NTA...  your free to feel the way you wish..  but sad that you don't want anything to do with them", "ESH and I'd suggest therapy for you.

You just feel how you feel. You are going trough a lot of changes in your teenage years and the fact u told them u don\u2019t hate them but just don\u2019t feel a brotherly bond with them is a very mature way.

Therapy is a safe space where you can be brutally honest. Being asked if you \"loved\" them was THE loaded question.\n\nUnfortunately, your apathy towards your step-siblings is not uncommon. People have different degrees of attachment to others, even those with whom we share both parents by blood. \n\nAt 16 -- pardon me if I write out of turn -- you don't really know how you will feel a year or five years from now. Teen years are crucial in establishing individuality, a sense of self can be totally consuming. It's your time to be an operatic diva -- ME, ME, ME! There is little time or emotion left over to children who are at least 12 years your junior.\n\nEven if you feel indifferent, you can still be kind. At their ages, a little of your time would go a long way.\n\nAnd be careful that you don't get into the habit of weaponizing your truth as a means to get what you think you want or to say whatever you want and think there should be no reprisals because it's \"truth\"; that would be an asshole move.", "NTA. I get your perspective, but at the same time would it really ruin your day to engage with them? No one can force you to love them, but they are family now. I have step siblings now, and it makes my little bro really happy if I just sit there, and watch him play some video games. Would you not have time to hang out with them some, and then do your own thing? They probably love you, and really want to spend some time with you. No one can force you into a big brother role, but I don't know what is so terrible about stepping into that role a little bit. People get divorced every day, and families change. Why not embrace that a little. It feels good to make others happy around you, whether their blood or not.", "NTA.

That's disgusting and wrong, and your father going along with it is worse. Had they simply allowed you all to exist together, your relationships would have developed naturally as the kids grew up and developed personalities.

Few teens actually want to be around little kids like that and the future isn\u2019t set in stone. However I see that being an unlikely outcome if they keep doing what they\u2019re doing. Also you wouldn\u2019t want to leave so bad if they weren\u2019t so insistent on steamrolling your feelings. And I would say you had to be that honest because you were getting nowhere by being polite.

You could hang out with them, watch movies, and play a fatherly role with them. But you don't want to, right? Because those are random kids who you don't feel any attachment to. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen to them, but you have no desire to hang out with them and form a bond. Just like I don't want to form a bond with your other kids.
