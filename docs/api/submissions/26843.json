I (16m) was there and so was my dad and his wife, Dina. We started group therapy a few months ago because dad and Dina wanted me to be closer to my half siblings and didn't like how indifferent I am to them (the kids). For almost two years now they have been up my butt about playing or watching TV with them or sitting with them and trying to engage with them more so they know I'm their big brother who will always look out for them. That is not something I want to do and never has been. Their pestering got so bad that I asked my dad if I could move in with my grandparents or my uncle. After that we went to group therapy together.\n\nFor a few months now we have been going around in circles. They want me to be more involved with the kids and play more of a brotherly role in their lives. Dina said the kids already look up to me and I should be making more of an effort because they are only this little (4, 3 and 7 months) once. She also said that her kids deserve more than for me to be indifferent to them. I have been asked why I don't want to be closer to them and I said I see them more as dad's kids with someone other than mom and not really siblings. I was asked if I wanted to change that and I said no and I had no plans to try and change that. We kept circling back around the same topics. So then my dad asked why I wanted to leave so bad. I told him I knew they would not let up on trying to force me to be more involved and I know he would also try and change how I feel.\n\nIt was the next session where they asked if I even loved my half siblings and I decided brutal honesty was maybe the only way to get what I wanted. So I did just that. I said no, I don't love them, I'm indifferent to them. I made it clear I don't hate or dislike them but I have no interest in changing how I feel. I will forever be indifferent. I won't be a dick to them but I won't ever be the brother to them they want me to be. Dina's reaction was as I expected it to be. She was saying I should just go to live with my family then and leave her kids alone because I would break their hearts and not even care.\n\nIt was only afterward my dad was on me for doing what I did to get what I want. He said he knows I held back the last few months because I thought they would give in faster and he said it's an asshole thing to want to leave so badly that I would hurt both of their feelings like that, whether it was in therapy or not.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694695596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ihiut/aita_for_being_more_brutally_honest_to_get_what_i/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA for expressing yourself clearly. NTA for wanting to live where you weren't being pressured to change your feelings.\n\nBut, I wonder why you don't want to feel a part of this family. Do you want to live somewhere else because you are isolating yourself or because you are hoping to feel more loved and cared for with your grandparents or uncle? Is your current life centered on these new little beings in your dad's life? Are you feeling side-lined? Marginalized?", "NTA\n\nYour father and stepmother cannot dictate to you how you should feel.  Sounds like you tried to communicate your feelings to them, they didn't pay attention, and now, after your \"brutal\" honesty (did not sound so brutal to me, just honest), they get it.\n\nThey really should not try to force the situation - it obviously backfired.", "NTA. Diana has to learn that her wish to form a family unit doesn't make that happen.  She's trying to push you together and demanding that you kiss. It just doesn't work in the real world.", "NTA they wanted honesty and they got it. You can't force a familial bond.", "beautifully said", "Thank you!", "Apparently I should take an interest in those things for them out of love. That's how they see it at least.", "Honestly, they're not necessarily idiots. My oldest nieces were tweens and then teens when their half-siblings were born and they absolutely adore them and definitely spend time with them. And I know other blended families where that's also the case, so it's not unheard-of at all.\n\nBut none of those older siblings were PUSHED to. They loved their stepparents, were made to feel included and heard throughout their half-siblings coming along, and given lots of space to do their own things and time alone with their parents. So when they bonded with the little ones, it was in their own time and at their own pace.\n\nThe issue here, I think, is in forcing him to feel something that he just . . . doesn't, and not hearing what he's telling them. And it sounds like that's been happening all along.\n\nThe stepmother talks about \"what her kids deserve\" but hasn't thought about or acknowledged what OP deserves: respect, space, time, and to build a relationship with his half-siblings on his own terms.", "I'm supposed to do all that stuff with them. And also play dress up or tea parties. Play with their stuffed animals. Sit and ask them stuff and take an interest in them in that way.", "Not even for bio siblings.", "They don't really ask me to babysit. Though I do notice a lot of extra pushing for me to watch TV with the kids is when Dina wants to do chores around the house or talk to some of her family. It's not just then but she gets extra pushy about that kind of thing then.", "I would say mostly to get what I wanted (to be able to live somewhere else). I have been honest up to now. Just not as honest.", "I know they are my half siblings.", "He obv knows theyre his step silbings hes not denying that cause thats how genes work lol but it literally means nothing at all if he doesn't want it to", "I am tired of having them on me all the time to spend time with the kids and to take more of an interest and be more of a brother. I'd be fine staying if that wasn't such a huge part of what it's like at home now but it is. I'm not going to fight to change that either. We've been in therapy for months and nothing has gotten better on that front. If anything they push it more often.", "What interests of yours has Dina taken an interest in, \"out of love?\" Or are you the only family member who is expected to change who you are?", "Do your parents do all that with the kids? \n\nNTA but I think they would like you to do more than they are willing to.", "I'm relieved to hear they're not making you watch them solo. Also, if it's not too tough a subject, is your mom still with us?", "Fair enough. Doesn't seem like you've done anything wrong though", "I hear you. I think my questions were more for you to do some self-reflection rather than answering me. Your feelings are not unusual. I see kids who feel apart from the new family just as much as kids who jump in. My questions were posed for you to think on why you feel apart. \n\nHas the therapist tried to push your dad and Dina to reflect on your view rather than focus on their own? I wonder if they've consider what a 16M is feeling when faced with half-siblings ages 4 and under after 12 years of being an (I assume) only child.", "INFO: Do you actively avoid your step-siblings at home? Do you yell at them to leave you alone? I understand you feel indifferent, but I encourage you to remain calm and civil.", "Only me. I'm supposed to fit into the mold they created for me.", "Dina does that with the kids. Though not too often. She expects me to do it more than her. My dad might watch something with them sometimes.", "Yeah, it's something I'm glad for too since I'm sure I would have to deal with even more crap from them if they were expecting some Mary Poppins level of babysitter.\n\nMy mom died when I was 8. I miss her all the time.", "The therapist has been pretty useless in my opinion. I'm not sure why they even bother sitting in on sessions sometimes because they'll ask a few questions but mostly leave us to talk stuff out.", "I don't yell at them or raise my voice either. I don't go out of my way to interact with them and I mostly do my own thing. But if they came up to me I'd answer a question or acknowledge their presence. If the 4 year old asks me if I want to do something I'll say no but I won't be mean about it.", "Have you asked your dad why you need to change instead of him changing his expectations? He's your parent. It's his job to make you feel.comfortable in your own home, not the other way around.  \n\nSorry this is happening. I know it must suck."]}
