For almost two years now they have been up my butt about playing or watching TV with them or sitting with them and trying to engage with them more so they know I'm their big brother who will always look out for them. That is not something I want to do and never has been. Their pestering got so bad that I asked my dad if I could move in with my grandparents or my uncle. After that we went to group therapy together.\n\nFor a few months now we have been going around in circles. They want me to be more involved with the kids and play more of a brotherly role in their lives. Dina said the kids already look up to me and I should be making more of an effort because they are only this little (4, 3 and 7 months) once. She also said that her kids deserve more than for me to be indifferent to them. I have been asked why I don't want to be closer to them and I said I see them more as dad's kids with someone other than mom and not really siblings. I was asked if I wanted to change that and I said no and I had no plans to try and change that. We kept circling back around the same topics. So then my dad asked why I wanted to leave so bad. I told him I knew they would not let up on trying to force me to be more involved and I know he would also try and change how I feel.\n\nIt was the next session where they asked if I even loved my half siblings and I decided brutal honesty was maybe the only way to get what I wanted. So I did just that. I said no, I don't love them, I'm indifferent to them. I made it clear I don't hate or dislike them but I have no interest in changing how I feel. I will forever be indifferent. I won't be a dick to them but I won't ever be the brother to them they want me to be. Dina's reaction was as I expected it to be. She was saying I should just go to live with my family then and leave her kids alone because I would break their hearts and not even care.\n\nIt was only afterward my dad was on me for doing what I did to get what I want. He said he knows I held back the last few months because I thought they would give in faster and he said it's an asshole thing to want to leave so badly that I would hurt both of their feelings like that, whether it was in therapy or not.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694695596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ihiut/aita_for_being_more_brutally_honest_to_get_what_i/", "score": 790, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They loved their stepparents, were made to feel included and heard throughout their half-siblings coming along, and given lots of space to do their own things and time alone with their parents. So when they bonded with the little ones, it was in their own time and at their own pace.\n\nThe issue here, I think, is in forcing him to feel something that he just . . . doesn't, and not hearing what he's telling them.

A parent interfering, because they have another dream of What the relationship should be, risk ruining the potential for *any* kind of relationship in the future.\n\nI\u2019ve been there, with my older siblings. It came to a complete head when I reached my teen years, that I refused to speak to my older siblings for almost a year. It took my mom butting 1000% out of it, for us to rebuild a relationship that fits *us*, the kids, the siblings.

They're 4, 3, and 7 months. I don't think that OP not sitting with them or watching TV (*Miss Rachel, maybe?*) let alone moving out is going to rock their world and damage them emotionally.

Please tell you dad that their only hope of you haveing feelings for your siblings was to let it happen organically.

Trust me when I say that EVERYONE looks back and knows that as a teen, their were dumb in a lot of ways. And one day you will realize that they really are your siblings and who knows, you may need help one day and they may be the only ones who could help you and now its not an option because whether you want to admit it or not, you parents cause you to hate them, it was not a decision you \"just made\" and your immaturity is what kept them from being a part of your family.", "NTA...  your free to feel the way you wish..  but sad that you don't want anything to do with them", "ESH and I'd suggest therapy for you.

You just feel how you feel. You are going trough a lot of changes in your teenage years and the fact u told them u don\u2019t hate them but just don\u2019t feel a brotherly bond with them is a very mature way.

Therapy is a safe space where you can be brutally honest. Being asked if you \"loved\" them was THE loaded question.\n\nUnfortunately, your apathy towards your step-siblings is not uncommon. People have different degrees of attachment to others, even those with whom we share both parents by blood. \n\nAt 16 -- pardon me if I write out of turn -- you don't really know how you will feel a year or five years from now.

It just doesn't sound like you can be what they want you to be.", "NTA.                                                                                                                                                                                                           I don't understand how so many parents don't seem to understand that the harder they push on an issue like this the more resentment will grow. They have now pushed you to the point that you no longer want to be around any of them anymore, that's really sad - but understandable. You must be feeling terrible stress every time you're with them.", "If that's exactly how you said it, then no, you're not an asshole. You're just being direct after being badgered endlessly. You weren't \"brutally honest\", just direct.\n\nIt's also true that they are demanding things from you that they don't have a right to expect. People who get married tend to automatically expect the kids to start playing \"happy family\" and then get bent out of shape if that doesn't happen.\n\nIt's good that they brought you to a therapist so you can make it completely clear that it's not something that's going to change. Now there's someone they respect to help argue that things aren't going to work out the way they wanted.\n\nI hope that you're able to find a better place to be. It sounds like your stepmom is going to be rather unhappy with you for a while.\n\nIf you get to live elsewhere, maybe consider being willing to try being friends with the kids without feeling like you have to be their brother. I can appreciate that for now you just want to get away because it feels so forced.", "NTA.  They need to know if they\u2019re going to force a connection and control you like that", "NTA.  They can't force feelings on you.  Perhaps you could ask the therapist to focus more on helping your dad and stepmother adjust to how you feel about the family, instead of them focusing on making you change.", " NTA. Sounds like they want a free baby sitter, bonds can\u2019t be forced. Trying to force something usually ends with the opposite effect.", "NTA. and it\u2019s gross that they\u2019re prioritizing these kids over you. You\u2019re still a child and a part of the family, Diana saying you need to go live with other family and leave her kids alone is fucking disgusting. It\u2019s gross to act like you\u2019re not a part of the family now because you\u2019re not in love with her kids.", "NTA.  It sounds like you're being forced into a bunch of things you don't want.", "NTA. The entire purpose of this sort of 'therapy' is to browbeat and manipulate you into behaving how they want. It's fundamentally destructive the the bonds you do have, but they won't realize it until it's too late.", "NTA and your dad said it so. You'd held back in hopes they'd stop pestering you. This indicates he already knew of your wishes and still persisted and hoped to overwrite your own desires through persistance. Was it a little too brutal? No. Because by his own account YOUR father pushed you to that point.\n\nReally did he expect the magic therapy session to make you soften your words and make you speak the exact opposite of what it is you feel out of peer pressure?", "NTA. It's better to be honest about what you are feeling. Hope your family situation gets better, don't be pressured to change what you are feeling. I think your Dad needs therapy to accept your feelings and that he is responsible for the situation.", "NTA. It's completely normal for a 16 year old to not be particularly excited about spending time with Pre-K kids. It's mostly babysitting rather than genuinely equal relationships like you might have with a near peer. Even if they were blood siblings, you being more interesting in your own stuff would be normal and fine, as long as you were polite and occasionally did full family things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did nothing wrong at all at any point (based on what you've said).", "NTA. Just because your dad wants to live with some woman he met and their kids doesn't mean you have to. People who try and force \"blended families\" on teens are absolutely nuts, and they all deserve the heartache and chaos that often follows.", "NTA \nThis is exactly what therapy is for. To be in a safe place, with a neutral and trained mediator, and express your actual feelings. People make me crazy with their \"Happy Family Fantasies\" Just because your Dad and his wife love each other does not mean you automatically love the wife, her kids, or their kids together. Trying to FORCE feelings NEVER NEVER NEVER works, in fact it usually makes things worse. \ud83d\ude24 I am interested to know what your therapists take on this is?", "NTA. The nerve of your stepmom telling you that you should just leave. You were there first. She doesn\u2019t get to just enter your life and expect you to care about her kids as much as she does, to the point where if you don\u2019t, you no longer belong IN YOUR OWN HOUSE. No one asked you if you wanted any of this. You can\u2019t be expected to care as much as they do\u2014they made the choice, you did not. \n\nYes of course it would be nice for everyone to love each other. But it can\u2019t be forced. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very hard on you being a teenager in a newly blended family.", "Fully agree. Everyone I know with a significantly older sibling is not close with them because tweens and teens generally don't want to play with toddlers! It's very normal with such a large age gap for teenagers to be busy with their own lives.", "Oh good grief. These kids are more than a decade younger, so they probably won't even remember much of this, and even if they did it's not Opies responsibility.", "I agree with you. But, the parents are definitely the AH here either way. \n\nThe lack of empathy is very concerning. It may just be because of the parents pushing it. Forcing babysitting duty. Being helicopter parents in terms of emotions. Or his age even. I remember wanting to get away from my family as a kid too, and feeling indifferent to things that in hindsight: I regret and were not representative of my true feelings.\n\nOr it's just a person with little/no empathy. Which isn't necessarily wrong so long as they don't start murdering animals in the backyard. \n\nThey are family. Blood family even, though only half. That's a dumbass reason to not love a family member who cares about you and hasn't done anything against you. \n\nI have blood family members I don't 'Love' because they are toxic. \n\nI have non blood family members who I do love because they are good, caring people. \n\nReally it's just a complex situation here and I don't think we have enough details to understand it and make guesses as to what the actual problem is. It's fair to say that the parents made the problem worse and have unfair expectations. It is also fair to say that the lack of care towards people from OP in general is concerning.", "This is totally and completely normal. The age gap is massive, so even if these were blood siblings, it would be completely reasonable and acceptable to not spend that much time with them. 16 is an age for spending time with friends, studying hard for college, working a part time job, dating, etc. not playing tea party with little kids. Some people like that, and that's okay too, but it's not the most common.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides, plenty of people do not consider half-siblings to be the same as full siblings. Especially if their dad clearly prioritizes the new fun wife and kids over his older son. If his dad actually loved him just as much, as soon as he said, \"You're bothering me so much I don't want to live here anymore,\" that would have prompted self-reflection from the father.", "I am just as perplexed. One of my comments keeps getting downvoted because I encouraged the OP to have a heart-to-heart with his father and stepmother.", "This 16 year old lost his mother at 8. Then Dad remarries and has a whole pack of kids 10+ years younger, and wants to play Brady Bunch. And people are surprised Opie isn't interested? Come on people.", "I think we found Dina \ud83d\ude44", "Right? I\u2019m guessing the median age of the responders is also about 16.\n\nOn the bright side, being a self centered asshole at 16 is pretty normal.", "Why not? He's a teenager, they are more than a decade younger and annoying. Y'all need to get out of the Big Happy Family/ It Takes a Village fantasy world.", "This. Additionally, OP should consider what he is possibly losing out on by refusing to forge a bond with his young siblings. Mine have brought so much into my life, they're people I can rely on no matter what.\n\nOf course that's not always the case but, given how young OP's siblings are, the nature of their relationship will be determined largely by him. Feels like OP is cutting off his nose to spite his face.", "Free babysitting. My half brothers have an even bigger age gap with me than OP and his little sibs, and the number 1 thing my parents did that made them resent me was telling them that free babysitting is the point of older children.", "no adult (or young adult) wants to do those things. They are boring, the parents should organize play dates with other kids instead of forcing you to. NTA.", "Like a parent would. NTA", "I would prefer a root canal myself.", "That's literally babysitting", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Honestly at your age I would\u2019ve said something very bad to get out of that situation, you just said how you really felt and it wasn\u2019t really bad or harsh, just the truth.", "I agree. It\u2019s completely normal to want your child to have a relationship with their siblings, and babysitting has nothing to do with that.", "I am surprised at the number of commenters who are assuming the worst about the OP\u2019s father and stepmother. There is clearly more to the story.", "Yep. This is really no different than if the kids were full siblings. A big issue is the age difference. OP was 12 when the first half-sibling was born. Some 12 YO would love it, others not so much.", "Yep. Or just packed a bag and went out the window.", "What benefits? The only one benefitting is dad, and none of this is any if ops responsibility. He owes them nothing. Dad wanted a new wife and family, he has it. Why should op be required to play along with dads fantasy?", "I\u2019m curious about what the therapist said?", "NTA and there's nothing wrong with how you feel.\n\nThe therapist is not doing their job if, in all this time, they haven't prompted your parents with any questions to get them to consider a different perspective (you have had no say in the step family entering your life; blended families do not all - or even mostly - blend perfectly; your needs are every bit as important as her kids' needs...). I think I would point blank ask the therapist if they plan to just let you go one saying you don't want this and the parents to push for what they don't want... or is this therapist going to help anyone see things in a different light. If they won't or you get the sense that the therapist is catering to your dad/stepmom, then tell them you want to see someone else. If your grandparents/aunts/uncles/ etc. can speak on your behalf, please ask them to. Good luck.", "Why do your parental units think their feelings are more valid or more important than yours?  If there are any more therapy sessions, I might bring that up.\n\nETA - NTA, BTW", "They watched too much TV growing up. PSA: The Brady Bunch, Eight is Enough, and Happy Days were all fictional!!!", "So Diana is looking for an extra caregiver, not a sibling for her kids. Bring that up with the therapist.", "I'm not going to argue with you. OP should talk to a therapist, not reddit.", "A paycheck.", "Me too!!", "Not to be harsh, but of course the therapist is catering to the parents, They're the ones paying him, and if they don't like what he's telling them they're probably going to go to find someone who does. IMO they're going to therapy to have a 'neutral' third party tell him he's in the wrong", "\"I don't want to\" is a satisfactory answer when you have absolutely no responsibility to do what the other person is asking. Teen or adult, it doesn't matter. Dad started a new family, good for dad. His son is not responsible for that, nor does he have to play along and pretend like its the Brady Bunch.", "YAY!!!! Best of luck to you! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "Very irresponsible and gross thing to tell a 16 year old that their father failed them because he wanted to try to rebuild a family. \n\nHe didn\u2019t do it right, sure. But failed him? Come on. This guys going to grow up one day and unless he\u2019s cool with having 0 family to lean on at all in the worst times, I\u2019d cool it with the condemnations. \n\nThey want different things and they don\u2019t know how to make it work, it\u2019s a problem but there are infinitely worse people out there. They\u2019re don\u2019t seem to be bad bad people, they just don\u2019t know how to cope with it all.", "I moved 250 miles to get away from my family. He will be better off.", "His father had a family which he has failed to do his duty towards. If he cannot keep both his son and his wife, new kids happy, he shouldn't have had the latter.\n\nThis isn't a \"Is it fair for me to have to double up in a room for a bit?\" post, it's a post about a father fundamentally failing to treat his son's feelings and motivations as important.", "I am so sorry for your loss, OP. \n\nI wonder if your indifference stems from the lack of closeness. Would you feel the same about your half siblings if you and your father had a closer relationship?"]}
