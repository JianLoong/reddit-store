Recently my daughter and I went to az to visit my family.\n\nSo our daughter had gotten sick. She had a fever and no appetite and was vomiting up everything she ate or drank. I called my bf to tell him something was wrong. He brushed it off and said she was fine but in my gut I knew something was wrong. My daughter got pneumonia when she was 6months old and was smiling through the pain. This time she wasn\u2019t her smiley bubbly self at all. Plus she got extremely pale so I decided to take her to the hospital. This is the first time she was in the hospital out of state. After waiting nine hours to see the doctors and have them run test. They told me that she would have to be admitted. I was scared. This was the first time she\u2019s ever was admitted to the hospital and we were out of state.\n\n My family was there but couldn\u2019t be physically inside because of their policy. Only 2 adults per child.\n\nOnce they told me that my daughter was admitted I immediately called my bf and told him the news. I also found out in that phone call he fractured his leg while drunk at a party the weekend prior. I was surprised he didn\u2019t tell me sooner but let it go because there were more important things at hand. I asked him when is he coming down and he just looks at me confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked. I told him, you are coming down right? He just said no that in case his work called him in that he needs to be there. I was shocked because his job required him to be on his feet all day and he\u2019s injured. He\u2019s not going to going back to work anytime soon. Honestly thought he was joking but he was serious. Even my family was shocked and was asking why he isn\u2019t coming down. It\u2019s his daughter too. They even offered my bf a plane ticket out here. My brother said he\u2019ll offer to drive to cali an back so he can see her but he just turned them down. When our daughter asked for her dad I didn\u2019t know what to say. She just kept calling his name. But unfortunately he never showed.\n\nOur daughter was sick. She was severely dehydrated because she vomited everything she consumed. Her blood sugar level were low as well because of the vomiting. Turns out she had the rsv virus. We stayed in the hospital for almost a week before they let her go home. I stayed the entire time not leaving her side  once. \n\nI don\u2019t think I can forgive him for that. Our daughter needed him and he wasn\u2019t there. He called but to me I felt like he should be there physically for his daughter when she was in the hospital not over the phone.

And maybe not wanting to fly but not travel by car to a seriously ill child, \"fractured leg\" or not? I don't think I'd forgive him either.\n\nNTA.", "NTA: what sold me was the week, I\u2019m going be honest no good parent would allow they child to be in the hospital and not show up especially for a week. I could understand a day or two. But a week that\u2019s crazy. Your family provided him with so many options including coming to see her and going back and he still said no. Girl plan your move now and keep it pushing. So what would have happened if she was home sick, u was out. Would he ignore her and dismiss her. \n\nI think how a parent treats their children is a clear tell of who they are a a person. Because of you treat ur own children someone you create poorly then you can\u2019t be a good person.", "NTA. If she were in overnight, and he didn\u2019t have means to travel over, his excuses would make more sense; but after an RSV diagnosis, with family members offering to drive him over, he just sounds like a lazy father.", "NTA.  Once it became apparent that she was in for a significant stay, BF had an obligation to stop whatever partying he was doing and come visit.  Doubly so once people offered to pay his way.  I'd be super angry at him for not coming, not to mention suspicious of what it is he is actually doing that he can't leave.  As OP stated, it's not like he's working.  His excuses aren't aligning here.", "NTA. Your daughter is his responsibility too. He should have showed up. It\u2019s more so cruel that she was calling/asking for him and he didn\u2019t come.", "NTA, the fact that he didn't drop everything for his daughter who is incredibly sick is definitely grounds for separation.", "NTA.  it is the people who show up that matter. \n\nif there were significant financial restrictions that would prevent him from dropping everything to be there, or if he needed to maintain the household or care for other family members, it would be a different issue.  based on the broken leg scenario, it sounds like he is just immature and selfish.", "NTA file for child support and be done with it. Your daughter deserves better.", "INFO: If I'm reading this right, you were in Arizona and he was in California? Does his employer offer modified work? Did he call frequently to keep up with what was going on? Are you in a financial position that he didn't need money and could have taken emergency leave?   \n\n\nI've been in your shoes, and while I was by my child's side constantly, my husband couldn't be. And that was at a local hospital. We couldn't afford it, as these illnesses like to sneak up on us when we don't have funds in the bank to cover everything. So he would visit every couple of days when we could spare the parking money.  \nBut if he just wrote it off and said \"yeah lemme know when you guys are coming back, I'm gonna take a nap bye.\" then yeah, that's a prick move.  \n\n\nBut there are a lot of factors as to why he wasn't there, have you thought about all of them? Or just that he hurt you by being absent?", "NTA. you're making the right decision.", "NTA.  Yeah, thats gonna be hard to forgive.  Dudes priorities are not right", "NTA\n\nPeople show their true colours when the chips are down. You both needed him and he wasn't willing to be there. This will not be the last time he does this.", "NTA \n\nPartners need to be able to rely on each other during hard times. What if things had taken a turn for the worst? Was he really OK with just not being there to comfort his daughter AND gf? What if you were the one sick? Would he even show? I personally would not trust him to have mine or my daughter's back which would therefore end the relationship. \n\nAlso, I feel like him not coming was also an indication of not taking your instincts seriously and being a \"hysterical/overreacting\" mother. That's another hell no. Partners should support each other even when/if others are doubting, at least to a point. He just sounds like a person who is along for the ride. \n\nINFO: not that it really matters but did he ever get called into work that week??", "NTA. Your daughter needs a good male role model, and this guy isn\u2019t it. What she sees is a guy who isn\u2019t there for her when she needs him. It\u2019s a fact that children end up seeking similar relationships that their parents (or male and female role models) have. You don\u2019t want her looking for guys that don\u2019t care about her.\n\nLeave him and find a good guy for you, and your daughter", "NTA- my partner shows more concern for our DOGS than yours does for his biological CHILD. \nGrounds for separation.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter spent a week in the hospital, and he chose not to be there for her.

To say that is crappy parenting is an understatement. It's abhorrent behavior.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this. I hope she feels better soon.
