Your mother shouldn't be adding guests at all, as she isn't getting married. She can make requests and suggestions, but the day is about the joining of you and your fiance, so you two get final say on the guest list.", "NTA. I had to tell my mom to stop inviting people to my wedding, they weren\u2019t invited by my ex and me.", "NTA. It's YOUR wedding. Let the friend know that she is not invited. Honestly, I'd probably not invite your mom either.", "YTA. Guys her mom is paying for half of this wedding. OP needs to edit this post and include this fact.", "NTA It's your day.  It's your one day. Run the day how you want it and forget everyone else.", "Absolutely positively NTA. She does need to step back & remember that this isn\u2019t her wedding. The hair and makeup, maybe she thought she was helping you out but it was still an overstep on her part.

I find it very bizarre that people are interested in attending the weddings of their friends kids who they barely know or didn\u2019t watch grow up and that parents are interested in having their friends attend. \n\nThat being said if she\u2019s paying half letting her have a friend is a small trade-off imo. \n\nAs for hair & nails, that\u2019s something you need to shut down. Cancel the people she hired and hire your own stylist.", "IDK, you haven't really told us how she reacted to being told to tone it down.", "NAH If you let someone pay for something, they think the have ownership of it.
