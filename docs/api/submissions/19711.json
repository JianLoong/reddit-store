She is your mom and if it makes her happy what's wrong, you don't necessarily have to interact with her friend do you?\n\nI am not sure if mom is a control freak and trying to take over the wedding or just genuinely excited and  wanting to help out and not realizing her intentions are not coming across they she intends.\n\nI doubt you will remember this in the long run, what matters is you are getting married to the person you love, everything else should be just background noise.", "Why are people here so hostile towards their parents, its not a big deal  and one should be able to do that for their parents, out of respect at the very least. As annoying as it is most parents, moms especially, look forward to their kids weddings and that enthusiasm can manifest itself in strange ways sometimes but it usually comes from a sincere place, its important to remember that.", "Lol if she doesn\u2019t invite her mother I\u2019m pretty sure mom is going to NOT pay for half of the wedding", "Also a good time to pay for her own wedding \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Then Op shouldn\u2019t be taking mom\u2019s money if she refuses to invite one friend of hers", "If Op wants full control than Op should have at the full bill. Mom is paying for half the wedding so should be able to invite a friend", "Choosing to pay towards your child\u2019s wedding absolutely does not entitle you to a portion of the control, what the hell man?", "She didn't have to give money for the wedding and doesn't sound like the money had conditions involved either by the post. I agree 100 doesn't seem a small number but in comparison to a lot of weddings 100 is definitely a small number wedding wise.", "Out of respect?\nWhy should OP 'show respect' for her mother when the mother clearly has no respect for OP", "If you\u2019ve never had to deal with a narcissistic parent, move along. Sorry to shatter your universe, but selfish parents exist.", "I had a small Indian wedding \u2026 300 people. \n  \nI always dreamed of the smaller intimate, 50 person wedding. But then I went and fell in love with an Indian man! Wouldn\u2019t change a thing :)", "When someone else pays for something for you control and power is basically given to the person paying. Money is power. \n\nTo pretend otherwise is foolish. \n\nPay for your own stuff. Can\u2019t afford it. Don\u2019t gripe when the person with money influences the event.", "> Paying for a wedding is a gift it shouldn't be used as a tool for manipulation. \n\nWell, you sure go from 0 to 100 real quick...\n\nIf you are paying for your own wedding, then asking you to extend the guest list to accommodate another person has a real life cost attached. That's not relevant here as OP's mother is obviously paying for the extra guest she's requesting.\n\nSomeone pays for half your wedding, and you're not even grateful or gracious enough to allow them to invite a +1? That's some entitlement...", ">If mom is paying for the wedding then she absolutely should get to enjoy the event she's giving to you with a friend at her side.\n\nHard disagree there. If you pay for someone else to do a thing you are not entitled to tell them how to do that thing, and still call it a gift.\n\nIf you gift someone a meal at a restaurant, do you expect to tell them what to have for starters, for mains and for dessert? Pick their drinks for them? Of course not. That would be unfathomably rude.\n\nSo why is it suddenly different when it's a wedding?\n\nEither you gift them the money for the wedding, and it's a gift, or you decide that since you're paying for it, you get to decide how it should go, and then it's just you making someone else dance to your tune for money.", "Why exactly should the bride's mother get to - or even want to - decide on who does the bride's hair and make up?? That is a very personal thing and incredibly weird to go over the bride's head with. Of course if she pays for it she gets to decide *how much* she's willing to pay for it, she can set a price range for it, but there is no reason to not let the bride have an opinion on who does her hair and make-up on her own wedding day. You wouldn't go and buy a bride a surprise wedding dress under the guise of \"I'm paying for it so I get to decide,\" you also don't do that with her hair or MUA. Not quite the same thing of course but it is her face, on her wedding day, of course she should get to have a say on who does it. Just hiring one without even bothering to consult with the bride makes me think the mom just uses the fact she's paying to control things.\n\nLetting mom bring a friend to an event she's paying for on the other hand, not a big deal to make a compromise on. It's not a small intimate event, it's 100+ people.", "Fair enough. This is a generation gap. We did our own hair and make. Glam squad, make up artists coming to our homes wasn't a thing. Hair, it was usually the beauty parlor in the morning", "It really varies depending on the country and culture. Where I'm from it's uncommon for parents to fund weddings, and the cases I know where they have, then they also get to add people to the guest list as part of the celebrations as a courtesy/thanks for paying.\n\nOP can decide not to invite people she doesn't want. She's not the asshole. However, the mum can also choose to no longer fund so much, and she won't be the asshole.", "Except possibly... a smaller wedding? :)", "If she offered herself to pay for the wedding because they're not in a good enough financial situation that is literally the definition of a gift", "If I am paying for dinner, I also get to invite who I want to come along the dinner.", "she DOES have a say. she already invited some family that op isnt close with, according to the original post", "I would agree with this if it\u2019s just a few people, but sounds like OP\u2019s mom already invited a bunch of her side of the family that OP isn\u2019t close to. If this one friend causes OP to not be able to invite someone she is close to, then I think OP has the right to ask her mom to not invite some other people. \n\nWedding is suppose to be about the couple not the parents. Whoever pays for it get to voice their opinions and should be taken into consideration, but ultimately the couple should have the final say in things. \n\nI feel a bit strongly about this because I have been to couple weddings where I have never met the couple. It was awkward and boring af. I felt nothing since I didn\u2019t know the couple. I didn\u2019t want to leave too early, so I ended up just sitting there on my phone lol.", "The mum may have someone lined up who does hair and make-up. Having a reliable person would lead to a smaller chance of anything going wrong.\n\n> It's not a small intimate event, it's 100+ people.\r  \n\r\n\nWhat do you mean it's not? It's a wedding! She also says about 100, so that's a fairly small wedding. Not a meet and greet. Some families alone can take up that 100 spots pretty quickly. Which the mother has already invited many along. There are a lot of places that if you're even 1 person over then you get a hefty charge.\n\nMany parents do contribute to weddings. They can help in some ways, but at the end of the day it's not about them. They can't go and invite others along to someone else's wedding. Just thinking quickly, if I were to get married I already have about 50 people on a list. That's not even taking into account my girlfriend's side. Take that into account. 100 people is a small wedding.", "Probably the parents of the groom pay the other half", "Then OP can hire her own makeup person. Oh wait\u2026. Mom is paying for half of everything including makeup."]}
