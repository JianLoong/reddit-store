Run the day how you want it and forget everyone else.", "Absolutely positively NTA. She does need to step back & remember that this isn\u2019t her wedding. The hair and makeup, maybe she thought she was helping you out but it was still an overstep on her part.

I find it very bizarre that people are interested in attending the weddings of their friends kids who they barely know or didn\u2019t watch grow up and that parents are interested in having their friends attend. \n\nThat being said if she\u2019s paying half letting her have a friend is a small trade-off imo. \n\nAs for hair & nails, that\u2019s something you need to shut down.

I\u2019m currently planning around the same sized wedding and we both have lots of family alone to consider and already cannot include all the friends we\u2019d like, so asking to include someone we don\u2019t know would be hard to accept.
