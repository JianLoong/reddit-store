The groom's family usually understood not to get ridiculous with the guest list. It was good manners to keep the halves balanced.\n\nIt was an opportunity for the bride's family to display their prosperity and for the young couple to be helped out in their early marriage with gifts of cash & necessary household items from extended family  The bride had likely already long been filling a \"hope chest.\"\n\nBut it wasn't uncommon for fathers to invite business colleagues and use the social opportunity to further their connections in the local business community.\n\nIt wasn't truly the bride's day. She was, even to this day in some circles, the commodity.\n\nToday, we rightfully chuck a lot of this rubbish to the curb.\n\nExcept many couples want to keep the part where their parents pay for it all while shutting their parents out of any decisionmaking.\n\nNope.

It's no longer a gift if you give it with strings or conditions.\n\nWhen you give a gift, it should be with good intentions and without any stipulations on it or with strings that come attached. That's what a gift is. Expecting someone to give you control of something just because you gave them money for it as a gift, is entitled as hell.

If you try and hold the money you gave somebody over their head as a way to get what you want, you are manipulating or blackmailing them. Threatening to take away that money, is also a form of manipulation.\n\nI don't get what's so hard to understand about that.", "But that was also probably a HUGE agreement made before hand.

Is she planning on paying for her friend to be there?", "NTA\n\nIf your mom is paying for any part of the wedding, she could (if you want) allow her to have ONE plus one.\n\nYour mother is taking over your wedding. Tell her to step back or she won't be invited.", "My sister-in-law took it upon herself to invite children of other relatives to our wedding so her kids could hang out with them-I made her go back and tell them that they were not invited. NTA-why do invited guests think they have a license to invite other people?", "Info: who is paying for the wedding?", "NTA\n\nA small wedding of 100 people???\n\nYou can invite whom you want to your wedding.\n\nI would want my partner join me to attend the wedding of my daughter, but after all - it's her wedding.", "You know what, I didn\u2019t pick up on that either lol. But now that you say it that would make a lot more sense to me.", "The OP has nothing to do with unfettered decision making. The mom wants to invite **a** person.", "If mom is paying for that person\u2019s food, drink, and seat, they actually should get a say.  \n\nIf you want 100% control, pay for it yourself.\n\nAlso in the comments she says it\u2019s her mom\u2019s plus 1, so OP is a huge YTA.", "We sent the invites, but asked our parents and siblings who they may want to be invited. Our wedding was something we wanted everyone to enjoy. It ended up being a blast and everyone stayed until the end. My family has always done it this way. They also know that there is a limit to how many can come.", "Lol no - I actually enjoyed the wedding. It was a great event. \nMy only wish was for there to be more time to spend with my guests. But that wasn\u2019t necessarily due to the size and more making sure my toddler was happy", "Heh, Yeah, right. Mom should pull her money\u2026that\u2019s how these things work in the real world!", "I could easily hit 60 on just my side of the family.  No friends.  Add friends and you would be over 100 easily.  And that\u2019s without the other persons side.\n\nSome people come from bigger families (and like them).  And some people come from fairly social families and accumulate people over the years.  Some people come from both.", "Win win. Her friend still isn\u2019t going"]}
