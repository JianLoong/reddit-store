Yeah a little harsh.  Lots of people have fads.", "I mean, NTA, but it's less of a double standard and more of you not understanding the culture.

I think it\u2019s fine to point out her hypocrisy, but the last part was definitely harsh. If you think she\u2019s weird and delusional, why are you friends with her? It sounds like you\u2019re being fake. I would never say something like this to one of my friends about their interests or hobbies.", "YTA.\n\nYou meant that to be an insult to her. If you were trying to be a friend, you wouldn't have said that.", "YTA. Are you sure this your friend? If she was doing this with  hip hop/rap artists, would it be the same? How about rival sports teams? How about fans of Taylor Swift? Rihanna?", "As a kpop fan myself being judgemental about her subscribing to Bubble as well as her buying merch and going to concerts is weird.\n\nAnd while her texting Korean words in English  can be annoying,you should've just  told her not to text you like that.\n\nSo soft YTA because you definitely could've handled this differently.", "NTA,sm really needs to give reality check to these obsessed kpop fans.while you were a little harsh to her at the end but sm needed to tell her that.", "As a kpop fan I can see where you are coming from but if you don\u2019t like the way she acts don\u2019t hang with her and don\u2019t be so harsh it\u2019s fine to point it out but don\u2019t be rude about it I understand your concerns about the way she acts but I believe you could handle it better", "YTA, as long as she's not stalking anyone or engaging in other damaging/creepy behavior, let her have her fantasies. (Also it's pretty common in kpop fan culture to think that all the fans of other groups are delusional and weird and social media just reinforces that line of thinking.)\n\nWe all do dumb shit in high school. Did I laugh at my friends for writing self-insert fanfic of their celebrity crushes while also being stupidly obsessed with certain celebrities? You bet. In all likelihood you've got some teenage behaviors that you're blind to as well. You can ask her not to drag you into it so much, but don't shit all over something she loves.", "NTA. You're doing everyone a favor by putting kpop Stans like this in their place.", "NTA. One of the advantages of attending junior high and high school in person is that you will learn real quick what behavior is acceptable to others and what is not. Her obsession/interest isn't what set you off. It was her hypocrisy. That's the kind of shit that will keep you from having real friends as an adult. \n\nThis is a great example of the kind of social rules school is supposed to teach us.", "Hahahah NTA\n\nShe needs a mood stabilizer.
