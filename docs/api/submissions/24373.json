Very kind and caring\n\nExcuse me, you're the one that flipped out and screamed to the top of your voice...but I'm so glad that he went back to normal after you were the one to snap and lose composure.\n\nI said it once, and I'll say it again. You're a flippin nut.", "ESH - you for yelling at him like that, because really in the history of marriage has yelling and shaming a spouse ever really worked? Not so much.\n\nHim for doing this repeatedly and not wearing a pad at the very least. The first time I leaked urine after my hysterectomy, I started wearing incontinence pads, and have now bought several pairs of underwear for it, and actually have an appointment with a pelvic physio next week.\n\nYes it's embarrassing, but frankly wearing a pad is less embarrassing that ruining my bed repeatedly, and impacting my husband.", "I don't really understand a lot of the comments here. I mean, yelling at him may sound harsh but honestly if my grown ass husband kept peeing next to me without seeking help I'd be frustrated too. If I were the one peeing in bed I know I'd do ANYTHING to fix it so that my partner wouldn't get piss on them. Wearing some type of protection to keep from pissing on a shared bed is way less embarrassing than peeing again and again without trying to fix it. I really don't feel like it's on her to make him seek help. There are plenty of embarrassing reasons to seek medical help but as adults we all have to take care of our own health and issues. Women have to keep from having periods on the sheets every month, I don't see how one should expect anything less from a man who has a known issue with bed wetting.", "YTA. I don't think it's unreasonable to not want to share the bed with him, but you should have spoken with him about it in a kind way. And you should be encouraging him to see a doctor to find out what's going on.", "38 years old and still pissing the bed?. Take him to the doctor, it's gotta be a medical condition. I would say NTA but I think he needs to see a doctor.", "YTA, you said you felt embarrassed, how do you think he feels? He should definitely see a doctor to make sure there's nothing physically wrong. It's likely he feels stressed, lost his job, 3 presumably young kids, a not exactly understanding wife. \n\nEven if you don't want to share the bed with him, there'd have been a much better way to address this. Stressing him out even more won't help. This is where you, as a spouse, are supposed to support him and offer help. \n\nHow would you feel if he treated you the way you did if you accidentally bled on the sheets during your period?", "What theeeee", "YTA. This is a medical issue and you\u2019re very crass. Do you even care about him? All you seem to care about is money and your clean sheets.", "That\u2019s so cruel, I\u2019m so upset for your husband. YTA", "NAH. I wouldn\u2019t want to sleep next to someone who May wet the bed, even if it\u2019s a medical condition. \n\nI think the best way is for both of you to sleep separately while seeking medical help", "\u201cI love my husband enough to die for him, but not quite enough to help him in his time of need\u201d", "YTA but so is he. \n\nDon't yell at him or ignore the issue, offer help and support!\n\nOn the counter, he should seek help rather than wetting your bed again and again, that's just disgusting. Of course he can't control it, but he can do something to prevent it or minimize the damage.", "NAH \n\nLike abit mean that you are yelling at him, but honestly he needs to do something about it and i\u2019m sure he understands that it is an issue.", "My thing is - would he rather be embarrassed of peeing everywhere, or wearing an incontinence pad. I'd choose the one that will be less impact on my partner.", "You forgot the massive YTA", "This.  Instead of just yelling at him, why not try to get your husband the medical help he needs?  He doesn't need you to die for you.  He needs you to be there for him.", "This. He could have prostate issues and let's face it, a prostate exam doesn't sound like a pleasant experience. He's embarrassed and needs support and a good check up.", "right I\u2019m like it sounds like he might need some serious empathy rn.", "The bread winner comment is to be transparent about the current situation and identify if this might be one of the root cause for him, nothing more", "I will check out the alarms. Didn\u2019t know about them. Well, I have been patient for sometime hoping this will wear off. Kids sleep upstairs, no one is aware but the two of us and Reddit friends", "He\u2019s a grown ass man. Why is it her job to seek him medical care??", "Yes thinking to see a doctor asap, thanks!", "You\u2019re right that this is a medical issue, but I\u2019d be screaming too if he continued to do nothing about it instead of going to the doctor. Its been WEEKS if not MONTHS that this is going on. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely in his control to investigate what is going on. He is a grown ass man, why hasn\u2019t he made himself a doctors appointment?? Is he just going to pee the bed forever? Why isn\u2019t he wearing depends or limiting his liquids before bed or literally doing anything aside from saying \u201coh well!\u201d \n\nThat isn\u2019t acceptable and he should be doing everything he can to prevent this instead of just reacting after and cleaning up. \n\nHe\u2019s the asshole for not taking any action.", ">because of a medical issue that\u2019s out of his control.\n\nGetting it checked is out of his control exactly why...?", "Why hasn\u2019t he gone the doctor himself after the first time? He\u2019s a grown man it\u2019s not on his wife to sort out his medical issues.", "While I understand your point at the same time as a grown person if I suddenly started pissing myself at night regularly that\u2019s a clear indicator that I should go to the doctor. \n\nOp shouldn\u2019t have to tell him that and shouldn\u2019t have to suffer waking up in a urine soaked bed.", "Stress incontinence is when extra stress is placed on the bladder (like when you cough or do a high impact activity like jumping) not mental stress.\n\nBut I agree that stress may well be playing a part on this. OP I get the frustration but you and hubby need a sit down and a grown up talk.  Seeing his GP should then be next on the list", "Oh nothing but the truth! Care to support a man and 3 kids for 2 years straight and still be a good wife and keep a straight face and tell me how that feels!", "Seriously, dude needs to go to the doctor and buy some adult diapers.", "He\u2019s an adult wetting the bed regularly. Why can\u2019t he figure out to visit a doctor??\nI\u2019d be annoyed if my spouse was lacking in common sense and continuing to urinate in our shared bed.", "lol! But thanks for getting me straight", "This.", ">Keep calm, stay adult, add refuse to accept or acknowledge any tantrum. If the tantrum gets too big, ignore all of him. In other words, you make him talk to you in an adult manner because you do not respond to anything else. \n\nFrom the post OP is the only one that seems to be having tantrums", "If the roles were reversed people on this sub would be calling him a AH and she should leave him immediately.", "> Well, I have been patient for sometime hoping this will wear off\n\nInstead of talking to him and being a supportive loving spouse? He's not a child and he's not on his potty training stage. Adults wetting the bed is not a good sign and it doesn't go away. you're being very cruel to him.", "Yeah just check out Amazon. They work pretty well. With his age it is enuresis is almost always because of medical problems, but very rarely it could come from something else like trauma. \n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. Kids hear and know much more than their parents think. Source: I\u2019m a child therapist.", "You should take him to see doctor. It might be stress related issue and it might be some other health issue that might be caused by stress.  \n\n\nAs you can see it won't just wear off and it's putting a lot more stress on your husband and a lot more strain on your relationship.", "YTA. Being patient is not enough, you have to be proactive. Adult bed wetting is no joke and it has been going on for a long time. Have you tried talking to him about it at least? It is a hell of a situation for him with job loss and all, he needs help asap! You don't mention him going to a doctor or doing therapy, it seems you both don't take it seriously enough. Or he is too ashamed to seek help. Adult bed wetting is not a harmless nuisance as childhood one is, it's a medical condition that can be very serious depending on what causes it. Apologize to your husband, talk to him, be there for him so he doesn't at least feel embarrassed so much, and make him see a doctor very soon! This will absolutely not magically resolve without you ever lifting a finger.", "If everything else fails, there are adult pull-ups available \ud83d\ude0a", "THANK YOU. I'm like all these \"take him to the doctor\" I'm sorry, but my husband is a grown man, and not my child. If he hasn't sought out medical care to this point, it's on him, not her.", "It isn't her job but she can easily suggest that her husband go in. From there it's on him if he doesn't \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Glad internet strangers had to tell you to see compassion on your partner.", "Maybe no job no insurance?", "I can understand that.", "You made a post on a public forum asking a question. This was my answer. Why are you angry? I did exactly what you wanted and answered your question.", "Two years!

It\u2019s just taking longer than to be over  I thought", "She wanted an echo chamber so she didn't have to feel bad for being an ah.", "Not angry, being transparent cause I need all the judgements right now to keep me focused. Thank you!", "I needed to hear this, thank you!!", "My heart breaks for him. \nAnother Reddit or said there's very disturbing reasons someone could wet the bed for, I really hope it's just anxiety because if it's something else he's gonna need a bigger support system and this person's not gonna give it. And the cycle will continue.", "And if you are yelling at him and he\u2019s sleeping in the other room, the kids know more about this than you think", "If you'll be sitting and waiting doing nothing it won't ever be over.
