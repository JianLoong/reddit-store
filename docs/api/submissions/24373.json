Tell him that he has your support and that you understand that it is very embarrassing for him.   That is called being a loving partner!  Screaming at him makes this even worse and may make the bet wetting worse.\n\n\" I love my husband so dearly and would die for him\"  I could never treat anyone I love the way you treat him, especially my wife.

Yelling at him isn't going to make it stop. \n\n He definitely needs to see a doctor. What if it's prostate cancer? Men can often struggle to get medical help and now he probably feels ashamed.

If it's medical and you start screaming the house down about it it's definitely gonna be psychological. \n\nYou've probably already done damage.", "YTA  - It sounds more like you resent him for the income issues and he would feel the contempt and it leads to pressure. Or maybe he has prostatitis which is hard to handle. His fears are not unreal since a huge amount of women get divorced after 5 years if the husband is a stay at home dad.", "YTA. A massive one. Your husband needs to see a doctor, not for a wife to scream at him.", "YTA, buy him some depends for nighttime", "YTA wow please get your husband a medical check up.

He should get medial treatment and / or wear adult diapers till it is resolved.\n\nI don't understand why he hasn't done that already. But I sure as shit don't understand the chain of though that made you think this situation will be solved by verbally assaulting your SO. And to top it all off, I don't understand how him submitting to you casting him away from your bed confuses you.\n\nOne common cause of bed wetting is anxiety. The kind you get when you can't get a job for 18 months. Or the kind caused by your life partner, the person that is supposed to be on your side, yells at you to do something. Then tries to paint you as the bad guy on the Internet, when you do what you were yelled at to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To address the elephant in the room. No. Being sole provider for family against your will is not great. But it's not a reason to abuse your partner either. If you've been pressed into this situation against your will, then that is something that needs to be addressed. Especially if the employment outlooks do not appear to be improving. But making a post that essentially reads as \"I make the money now, so I'm entitled to abuse my husband for his medical condition\" will not go over well.", "YTA. What makes you think it's in any way okay to scream at anyone, for any reason, especially someone who you claim to love and care about? \n\nClearly your husband is having a medical or psychological problem that requires empathy, understanding, and encouragement to see a dr to find out what's going on. What if he has bladder cancer or some other major medical problem that you're both ignoring?", "YTA. Idk why people think that screaming at someone solves any problem. Your husband sure as fuck doesn\u2019t deserve that. Do you scream at your kids if they wet the bed?", "YTA. He\u2019s not wetting the bed because he wants to. He needs empathy and kindness and maybe an offer to find a solution together\n\nCould he wear depends? You can also get washable pyjama pants with absorbent padding built in.

I began bed wetting, sometimes even getting some on my husband, and not only did he NOT yell or make me feel insecure WHATSOEVER, he would help me clean up the mess, help me get situated and then cuddle me afterwards telling me that it was not a big deal and that I was safe. I was also on medication at the time that amplified the chances of bed wetting. Just thinking of if he had handled it like you makes me so sad and anxious. In sickness and in health right?

He should have been on this 2 years ago.", ">It\u2019s just taking longer than to be over I thought\n\nDid you think it would just stop?\nIf it is a medical problem, it won't stop until it is diagnosed and treated. \n\nHe needs to see a doctor. He is probably scared to see the doctor for fear of what they will find. Most things are treatable but that doesn't stop us being scared.\n\nBe a supportive partner. I get that it isn't pleasant for you. It is even less pleasant for him. Encourage him to see the doctor, and support him through whatever comes. \n\nIf you carry on as you are, don't be surprised if he isn't there for you when you are ill or going through a rough time.", "Has it occured to you that it could be prostate cancer? Because bed wetting can be a sign of it.", "Have you asked him to make an appointment at the doctor?  If not doctor, then counselor.", "You signed up for all the lows in a relationship.

You have a calm talk with them. You don't just yell at them.", "I'm comparing not being able to control either and then being yelled at. Guy has some issues going on,sure. But waking up and yelling doesn't really solve it, does it. Just adds to the confusion and embarrassment. I'm sure the guy doesn't like it either. It's not like he's standing up and peeing on her like a Calvin and Hobbs sticker.", "you're really gonna yell at someone you love over pee before trying to discuss it in a more understanding way? if you're really standing behind that which is seems like you are then you suck", "There is 100% a toxic masculinity issue at play when it comes to men going to the doctor's, being seen as weak, less of a man. It's bullshit, but it affects a lot of men, and is the same reason why suicide rates are so high among men etc. \n\nNot really sure why you're railing against this with 'women have it hard too'. No one is arguing otherwise. But men not talking about their issues is a widely acknowledged and understood challenge, it can't be new to you?", "How does this work? You yell as everyday method of communication when you're not angry?\n\nBecause people usually tend not to do that unless they're angry.", "Sometimes, it is hard to ask for help, especially when you aren't sure the other person will be supportive.  \n\nYes, he should be able to do this, but clearly this is difficult for whatever reason. Screaming at someone who is struggling will not magically make the situation better. If she had a lump in her breast, but was afraid to get it checked, do you just scream at her or say \"she's a big girl, she can make her appointment.\" No, as a loving spouse, you do whatever you have to do to help your partner be healthy.", "Agreed 1000%. All the YTA comments seem based on the idea that op should be mothering her husband and have him seek out help. But her husband is a grown man and a parent. He is more than capable of calling a doctor and seeking help.

He's a fully grown man.", "My gf doesn't even snore but this is the point I'm trying to make. Don't just yell at someone cause you're upset. Like yelling isn't fixing anything. Dude is already embarrassed, and I'm assuming she wasn't exactly yelling helpful things. It's just odd to me that so many people think that yelling at someone for doing something in their sleep and out of their control is ok. \n\nIt reminds me of the video of the girl who's throwing her bfs clothes outside because he was having sexy dream about the girls sister.

This is crazy talk.", "You cannot, but you can do an ultrasound through the rectum if it is difficult to do through the vagina. Of course, I do not condone the reason the person above gave for that, but as for myself, I am unable to receive transvaginal ultrasounds and got diagnosed with PCOS with an ultrasound of the ovaries that was done through the rectum.

So you're part of the problem perpetuating this stuff!", "Your point?", "OK. Whatever you say. You're totally right.  I'm not arguing about something so stupid. If it wasn't before 6 am, I'd actually call the doctor and have them send something as proof. Did it ever occur to you that different doctors do more preventative testing than others? I guess not because you are flat out telling me that I am wrong about something that you didn't witness. \nGood Lord. \nPlease go have a good day somewhere else.", "It's definitely not a part of a gyno exam.
