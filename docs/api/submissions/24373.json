Tell him that he has your support and that you understand that it is very embarrassing for him.   That is called being a loving partner!  Screaming at him makes this even worse and may make the bet wetting worse.\n\n\" I love my husband so dearly and would die for him\"  I could never treat anyone I love the way you treat him, especially my wife.

Yelling at him isn't going to make it stop. \n\n He definitely needs to see a doctor. What if it's prostate cancer? Men can often struggle to get medical help and now he probably feels ashamed.

He should get medial treatment and / or wear adult diapers till it is resolved.\n\nI don't understand why he hasn't done that already. But I sure as shit don't understand the chain of though that made you think this situation will be solved by verbally assaulting your SO. And to top it all off, I don't understand how him submitting to you casting him away from your bed confuses you.\n\nOne common cause of bed wetting is anxiety. The kind you get when you can't get a job for 18 months. Or the kind caused by your life partner, the person that is supposed to be on your side, yells at you to do something. Then tries to paint you as the bad guy on the Internet, when you do what you were yelled at to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To address the elephant in the room. No. Being sole provider for family against your will is not great. But it's not a reason to abuse your partner either. If you've been pressed into this situation against your will, then that is something that needs to be addressed. Especially if the employment outlooks do not appear to be improving.

I began bed wetting, sometimes even getting some on my husband, and not only did he NOT yell or make me feel insecure WHATSOEVER, he would help me clean up the mess, help me get situated and then cuddle me afterwards telling me that it was not a big deal and that I was safe. I was also on medication at the time that amplified the chances of bed wetting. Just thinking of if he had handled it like you makes me so sad and anxious. In sickness and in health right?

Just like how you're embarrassed to talk to him about his bedwetting, it's embarrassing to say that you wet the bed to multiple people when going to the hospital and figuring out the reason behind it. You can't hope that it will just magically go away! It won't.\n\nBesides that, I'm almost inclined to say that YTA because you're confused about the reason your husband sleeps in the guest room. It's really obvious; the way you explode at him for something he doesn't want and can't control hurts him. But it makes me really confused because he doesn't do anything about his situation, not even putting an absorbent towel to patch up the situation. It's a messy situation, and you need to put the embarrassment aside and talk together.", "NTA. \nAfter reading all the Y T A comments, I would love to create a post saying \u201cAITA for screaming at my wife for refusing to use period products and continuously bleeding into the bed\u201d and see all the same people calm that poor fellow and promise he is definitely N T A for losing his shit about this. \nYes - this comparison is flawed and yes, shouting at him wasn\u2019t a fine move but considering the time span of this happening without him even stuffing his pants to avoid wetting the bed is just unreal.

He hasn't done ANYTHING wrong, this is completely not his fault, and yelling at him probably just made the issue worse.\n\nI think it's definitely fair to suggest for him to go to therapy and work through whatever he's dealing with.

The cycle continued because she lacked that love and shame-free judgement. \n\nHonestly I think you risk losing your marriage if you continue to frame this as something he's doing wrong. If your child did this, would you shame and shout at them? I hope not.\n\nAgain, it's valid to feel frustrated. But ideally you work through that with your own therapist, instead of putting more pressure on your husband. If you show support and empathy and kindness, that's likely the way this will stop.\n\nYour only expectations of him currently should be that he at least seeks help. It can take time to heal, and if the expectation is solely focused on ending what is likely a mortifying anxiety reaction for him, you'll be disappointed, and his cycle will continue.", "NTA.

Alcohol worsens both diabetes and sleep disorders. Your husband HAS to see a doctor. And he HAS to get an in-facility overnight sleep study.

What I\u2019m not seeing in the post is whether she ever \\*really\\* insisted he go to a doctor, but I also know from experience getting a full grown man to do so can be next to impossible if they won\u2019t get past the phase of agreeing with you in the moment to shut you up but then not actually ever doing it.", "When I was married to my ex-wife, I was overworking myself to exhaustion a lot, and had accidentally wet the bed a couple of times. My ex-wife got upset and made fun of me a couple of times. I was overworking myself because I had taken a job that gave me the opportunity to earn extra money, money I was using to catch up and pay of bills. My ex wasn't working extra to improve our financial footing. You can imagine how great that made me feel, to have my partner ridiculing me for a couple of accidents after I had worked massive hours (I was averaging 60+ hours a week, not including the commute) trying to make sure we had a solid future.\n\nFast forward a year later, when she got incredibly sick with the flu. We were sleeping in the bed, and she shit the bed. She was incredibly embarrassed, and super apologetic. All I could think about is how she made me feel when I had my accidents. I still didn't ridicule her. I helped her change the sheets and clean up, and I checked up on her as much as she would let me. Due to her past behavior, I could've treated her the same, but I was more worried about her. I wish she could've had the ability to act or think the same.\n\nWhen I look back on that relationship, it's things like that that remind me why it's better we split up.", "The first thing to do is rule out a bladder infection or something else along those lines because that can cause this. That should have happened after the second time, really.", "Right. And she didn't.. for the first 18 months of it. \nBut c'mon.", "She didn\u2019t jump straight to this reaction. You can imagine it happen once and you reacting, but she\u2019s been dealing with this for a while. \n\nHe\u2019s a grown man\u2014why isn\u2019t he addressing his problem himself? Initiating a discussion with her? He\u2019s acting like it\u2019s just a normal part of life and that\u2019s frustrating.", "i agree with you, though some people wouldn't see it the same way. maybe it's cultural too. i just can't believe people are so opposed to this idea of helping their SOs out. too much individualism lol", "Sadly, even our vernacular doesn't allow for a distinction between \"oh I'm a bit depressed\" and \"I'm suffering from an episode of depression.\" These are two very distinct things but the same word is used to describe both. \n\nClinical depression is honestly devastating for some people and can be very difficult for those suffering to even recognize in themselves. It's not always something someone goes one day and says \"oh you know, I'm depressed I'm going to seek help for this\" it's a silent war to just do life functions. Not to even think about the hurdles of seeking help for something you think may be the cause of your exhaustion. \n\nIt can also be a function of depression to tell yourself it's not worth the effort, that the bad things will still be there even if you get help. So why bother? \n\nBut you know it's not visible so a percentage of people just think it's either something you can get out of all on your own. Or that you are just making up excuses to be lazy. \ud83d\ude44", "Who said anything about leaving him. In principle marriage is a lifelong commitment to your partner.\n\nThe words are about supporting your partner through thick and thin. You don't just get to check out when things get a little tough (and compared to some of the horrific situations described in this sub this is a 'little' tough).\n\nIf it were my partner my first concern would be for their physical or mental health and support them in getting any help they need.\n\nSilently brooding over it for a few weeks then exploding in his face shows no love or concern on her side.", "I just wanted to mention,if you haven\u2019t considered pelvic floor physiotherapy you should look into it.

So that seems to absolve him of any responsibility any fixing a problem that is his and his alone to fix. My diagnosis is the unemployed \"nice guy\" is doing this deliberately to show contempt for his wife.", "neither of them are addressing it, thats the problem, I am not saying at all this is OP's sole responsibility.  I'm saying as a partner both he and she need to stop being embarrassed and seek help.  I get he needs to do it too, my initial comment was its not her responsibility, I disagree with that, when my hubby and I married, we took on an agreement to be partners in life, if needed I help him and he helps me", "Thank you.
