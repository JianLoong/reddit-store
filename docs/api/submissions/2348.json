Autism doesn\u2019t stop her from doing any of those things; nor is it a good excuse for avoiding her responsibilities - just have a blunt and honest conversation with her about how you both can share your space and the chores that need doing fairly, and help her get into a routine of picking up after herself if that\u2019s something she\u2019s struggling to remember to do, and you should be fine.
