I can see this backlash getting worse though so make plans to change your roommate/living situation as soon as possible.", "NTA. Remind everyone that you're dormmates. You never agreed to be her live-in caretaker. Talk to the housing authority about being assigned a new roommate.", "NTA. Tell them that it's still not your responsibility even if she really doesn't know better because you've never been hired as a caretaker nor did you volunteer to be one. But your rate starts at $150 an hour if they're going to keep insisting.", "NTA, why is it even expected of you in the first place? Was this a random assignment or where you consulted first?", "NTA at all. Neurodivergent people are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves and anyone who is telling her otherwise is doing her a massive disservice. It's honestly so disrespectful of them (to both of you) to act like it's your job to take care of another person who is your age and not profoundly disabled. Even if your roommate *were* profoundly disabled, it would not be your job to take care of her.

Clearly her family felt she was capable of living on her own if they sent her away to college. Learned helplessness will not benefit her. Stick to it and allow her to care for herself.

Taking care of her takes time out of your schedule, to attend class, study, attend study groups, maybe a part-time job, and yes - relax and enjoy your life.  Sarah is not necessarily part of any of that.\n\nWhen my daughter (with whom I get along really well) who is not neurodivergent became a messy monster in high school, I decided that I was not going to argue with her daily and I was NOT going to be her maid.  So, I put a large box inside her room and when she left stuff all over the house, I simply put all her stuff, clothes, books, notes, dirty dishes (within reason) in the box.  So we didn't argue about her stuff, and to her credit she didn't complain about it.\n\nYou could try the box method with roommate, and she can eat cereal if she cannot cook.

It\u2019s actually better for her to have people setting expectations for her that are achievable and reasonable; being autistic doesn\u2019t prevent her also becoming spoiled, and you seem to be the only one stopping that happening. Autism doesn\u2019t stop her from doing any of those things; nor is it a good excuse for avoiding her responsibilities - just have a blunt and honest conversation with her about how you both can share your space and the chores that need doing fairly, and help her get into a routine of picking up after herself if that\u2019s something she\u2019s struggling to remember to do, and you should be fine.

You should charge her.", "Someone who is not autistic can be an identically poor roommate. Trust me. So, this isn't about her autism, Its about you being a bad fit for cohabitation. At any rate, for the sake of your sanity, I'd look into a move with someone you'd rather be around. (I have had my sister and my best friend as roommates and even they got on my last nerve. I've had a thieving roommate and a roommate who brought guys in to sex up while I was in the room, in my bed sleeping. I've even had  the party girl roommate who'd get so drunk she had no idea how she left her underpants on my pillows. Having a roommate is a constant negotiation dance and compromise.
