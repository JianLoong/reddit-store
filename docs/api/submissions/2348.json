I'm autistic and even when I actually forgot to take care of my basic choir, never once I had an audacity to expect my roommate to do it for me!\nIf she is not capable to live by her own then she needs her own caregiver, not you!", "NTA\n \nReport this to housing or at least request to be moved.\nYou aren\u2019t her caregiver.", "NTA. Offer to switch rooms with her friends. They clearly want to make sure shes taken care of. Her family can help chip in too! Maybe suggest reaching out to school services so she can recive extra help since she can't do basic stuff that is needed to be a good roommate. \n\nOr report to whoever you need to report to for harassment from her friends and family because they expect yout to play caretaker to someone who probably doesnt need it. Using autism as an excure for weaponized incompetence is not cool.", "Nope-NTA\n\nSuggest to each and every person, they take up the slack.  Don't let them guilt you into being the loadbearer.", "NTA. My job as an autistic parent is to make sure my teenager, who's autistic, is full prepared for the world and how to take care of himself. This looks like teaching him how to identify good days and bad days, and coping skills on the good days to make them last longer and make the bad days a bit less bad. It also means we're teaching him how to keep a self sufficient routine that is sustainable for him. He does his laundry every Wednesday. It takes him two loads since he changes to comfy clothes after school. He does the trash on Mondays and Thursdays. He sits down and helps plan meals and snacks for the week, and helps with the grocery shopping. He's learned on hard weeks we get ready made meals so everyone is fed, and on good weeks I can make more homemade meals to balance our diet. He's learned how to make several dishes for each meal, so he'll never go hungry. For Christmas we're getting him a cookbook based on anime shows since he has a thing for anime. Were also teaching him how to reach out for help when he needs it so he doesnt get overwhelmed. If hes having a hard week hes asked if we can switch his laundry cuz the wet clothes are getting tk him, or here lately hes told us that the reason hes having a hard time in school is because he cant seem to get off his phone and we set some parental locks on it with his input. The point is, your roommate should be able to do basic care tasks. Maybe not perfectly, her laundry might not always be in the hamper or put away right, but it should be on her side of the room. She should be able to grocery shop herself, or learn when to go to the dining hall, or even get a grab and go box from the dining hall. She should as an adult, be communicating politely if she's having a hard time and would appreciate it if you could snag her something from the hall and give you money for it. She should not be relying on you if you have not agreed to that dynamic. You are not her parent nor her caregiver. If she needs a caregiver or personal assistant, that's perfectly fine, but then she and her responsible adults should be looking into how to get one for her.", "NTA. Autistic people are going to have to learn to be adults in the world like everyone else; they're done no favors by being treated like children in this way. Autism isn't a \"get out of human responsibility free\" card, but it wouldn't surprise me (since she's clearly competent and has cared for herself before) if Sarah 100% understands what's happening and is just choosing to abuse the situation because she knows she can get away with it. Put in for a room transfer as soon as possible.", "NTA\n\nIf Sarah isn't capable of doing basic tasks on her own, such as cooking simple meals, chores, her own laundry, then she shouldn't be living independently. \n\nYou are not her mother, paid PA or carer.

While you don't mind making accommodations for Sarah's needs, you are not responsible for her care.", "NTA\n\nEveryone deals crappy roommates in college", "Find out how you can get a new dorm mate", "NTA. You are her roommate, not her mother. If she actually needs a caretaker while at college, she or her legal caretaker needs to arrange it. \n\nShe is not your responsibility just because she is your roommate. You are not obligated to be her caretaker just because you live with her. You did not choose this, and should not be forced into this role.", "Send them a bill for the hours you have spent helping her and tell them if they expect you to help her then they can pay you and that is your part time job in college to help with your expenses. Or they can hire her a nurse to check in on her. Also report it to the college.", "You need to go to the school admin and tell them your being harrassed and bullied by her and her family and friends because you won't take care of her cooking/ cleaning/ etc at home. They need to be also told that while you tried to talk things out its only made things worse. You no longer feel comfy living with her due to the bullying and harrassment and you would like a new room assignment. NTA", "NTA, move out OP, if it's school dorms talk to your Residence office and see about changing rooms or moving someplace else. Either way you need to get out before you get gaslit even more", "NTA\n\nCollege is enough stress on it's own. You don't owe this person anything. I would ask for a room transfer if possible.", "Then i would complain. OP is not the caregiver. What if she has her own problems like depression? And as someone with autism: I hate it to use this as an excuse. Either you function alone or you don't live on your own. Don't expect others to do your stuff! Or special treatment in college and work \"but i can't do this, i\"m autistic!\". So why are you here?!", "This reminded me of an episode on good doctor. Lea was teaching Shaun how to drive but he was anxious about accidently running over someone and she was like you're not blind, you're autistic.", "Sure, people aren\u2019t expected to have absolutely perfect syntax, but words also have meaning. Their original statement, was, incorrect. That\u2019s why the clarification was helpful. I feel like it\u2019s not the end of the world to admit that the initial claim was overstated, and that it has now been clarified to avoid understandable confusion.", "Yes I agree. I'm glad it has been clarified.", "NTA. She is using her autism as an excuse to get you to be her servant. If she didn't ask for specific accommodations, I can't see how picking up after herself is something she can't do. If she is unable to do that, then she needs to live with a helper. But I would guess that she's always used her autism as a reason to get people to do things she doesn't want to do, not things she can't do.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t cope on her own she shouldn\u2019t be living on her own.", "NTA, just throw her clothes back on the bed, do not act as her mom.  Tell her she is an adult, she can take care of herself.", "NTA. Ask for a change in roommate. You're literally putting your life on pause for your roommate. That's not okay.", "Nope, don\u2019t go along with any of that help crap, she is just acting like a five year old testing boundaries.", "Totally NTA, I showed this to my husband who is on the spectrum and first words out of his mouth were \"she's faking not being able to care for herself\"", "NTA. If that\u2019s expected of you - I\u2019d start submitting invoices to be paid.", "NTA but this really needs to go to an RA or student housing. You are not paying college tuition and housing costs to play caregiver.", "If they\u2019re all so outraged, they can move in and pick up after her. NTA.", "NTA. I was convinced you\u2019d be TA bc I thought you meant \u201clooking after\u201d as in making accommodations for such as not using an aroma diffuser or something. But cooking and cleaning for her? Hell no! That\u2019s odd to expect that of you. I work with autistic kids and we work with them to help them be able to cook. Even if they couldn\u2019t, it\u2019s not your responsibility to. They\u2019re capable of grabbing a microwave meal and putting it in at the very least so don\u2019t worry.", "Easy NTA, if she cannot cook or clean, she needs some kind of carer.\n\nBut it sounds like she can, she's lying.", "Definitely NTA as many redditors said you need to talk to whoever is in charge of housing. And as many said, when someone talks down to you say great I will let her know you will take care of her ... and follow through.", "You are not responsible for her and shouldn\u2019t support her if she is capable. Yes, if she has additional support needs the college and her parents are responsible and not use you as unpaid help.\n\nI would ask to move and explain why this affects you.\n\nit about their thinking and thought process and parents or college should be looking at how the autism affects her abilities to manage day to day and her studies. \n\nHaving the diagnosis doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do things, just may be have different understanding and how process information. Reasonable adjustments should be made if needed and not because of the perceived need due to the diagnosis.", "NTA ask for a room change and explain its because of the change in her behaviour.", "Hi, autistic 21 year old here\u2026 lmao NTA. I cook for myself, I do as much cleaning as I can (I\u2019m also disabled so my bf does help me with this as long as I do all cooking and driving + he knew and agreed to all this before moving in together). She really can\u2019t use it an excuse and if she is she\u2019s going to have a hard time in life always finding someone to cater to her. If she always has up to this point already she\u2019s extremely lucky. Just keep reminding people you have your own studies and life you need to focus on.\n\nA key piece of advice that has helped me is realizing if people want to see you as the villain they will, especially if it keeps fingers from being pointed at themselves. You can scramble and argue back you aren\u2019t the bad guy but you keep moving forward and focus on yourself instead. These people are (hopefully) temporary.", "NTA. Do you have somebody within your university that you can speak to about this? Her friends and family are harassing you and causing you stress over something that isn\u2019t your responsibility at all. Your university needs to move one of you to another room, or if she feels that she can\u2019t look after herself (even though you know she can) then her family need to make arrangements for an official carer that isn\u2019t you.", "You are absolutely not the A-hole! I'm sorry your college experience has been dealing with a bad roomie situation. But she isn't your responsibility in the least. If her family and friends want to give you crap,  they can go to hell. How freaking ridiculous of them to think you would just jump into the role of caretaker for a stranger. There are programs across the country that cater to neurodivergent students and offer ways to encourage independence for autistic students. They need to send her to one of those universities if they think she needs caregivers.", "NTA. That's your bed, and she shouldn't put her clothes on it! You're going to school, you're gonna be busy. You can't afford the time to care for another human right now.", "NTA. Autism doesnt make you a fucking baby. Shes honestly dragging us all down by using it as an excuse.", "NTA, first, it\u2019s not helping someone to do things they are capable of doing themselves. Second, move out as soon as possible.", "NTA.

If she\u2019s fully capable of taking care of herself and high functioning then she can most definitely care for herself. However as someone with autism I personally work well on a structured schedule accompanied with a to do list, you can also make that a game for her like whoever keeps their side of the room clean gets a prize at the end of the month. If you wish not to do anything at all then talk to the housing department since it seems she\u2019s unable to care for herself and get a new roommate.", "NTA \n\nI went to highschool with a girl that would weaponize her autism. As in, she\u2019d ask other girls to go ask a guy she found cute if he was into her. And when they wouldn\u2019t? She\u2019d start crying and tell her teacher that they told the guy to not talk to her because she was ugly. And every single time the teacher sided with her rather than ask every one involved. She did this until a teacher actually heard the conversation before she started her performance. And she finally got in trouble for it. She was a mess for a week because she couldn\u2019t manipulate her teachers anymore.", "Stop taking care of Sarah. Report her to the RA and say she needs to live in disabled housing where she can be better looked after, since she is incapable of feeding herself or cleaning herself or cleaning after herself. The RA will take the report to her parents, and her parents will ask why she suddenly doesn't know how to look after herself. Then it's no longer in your hands. \n\nNTA but stop doing anything for her.", "NTA her being capable or incapable of caring for herself is irrelevant to the issue. If she needs a live in help, she can request and pay for a live in help.\nIf she is incapable of not intruding on your personal property (leaving her clothes on your bed), she cannot live with roommates and needs to find alternative solutions.
