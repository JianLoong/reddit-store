Autism doesn\u2019t stop her from doing any of those things; nor is it a good excuse for avoiding her responsibilities - just have a blunt and honest conversation with her about how you both can share your space and the chores that need doing fairly, and help her get into a routine of picking up after herself if that\u2019s something she\u2019s struggling to remember to do, and you should be fine.

It also means we're teaching him how to keep a self sufficient routine that is sustainable for him. He does his laundry every Wednesday. It takes him two loads since he changes to comfy clothes after school. He does the trash on Mondays and Thursdays. He sits down and helps plan meals and snacks for the week, and helps with the grocery shopping. He's learned on hard weeks we get ready made meals so everyone is fed, and on good weeks I can make more homemade meals to balance our diet.
