Autism doesn\u2019t stop her from doing any of those things; nor is it a good excuse for avoiding her responsibilities - just have a blunt and honest conversation with her about how you both can share your space and the chores that need doing fairly, and help her get into a routine of picking up after herself if that\u2019s something she\u2019s struggling to remember to do, and you should be fine.

It also means we're teaching him how to keep a self sufficient routine that is sustainable for him. He does his laundry every Wednesday. It takes him two loads since he changes to comfy clothes after school. He does the trash on Mondays and Thursdays. He sits down and helps plan meals and snacks for the week, and helps with the grocery shopping. He's learned on hard weeks we get ready made meals so everyone is fed, and on good weeks I can make more homemade meals to balance our diet.

She might be autistic but she\u2019s not your f responsibility she wants to sleep on a pile of poo let her unless she cleans. You\u2019re not her mother.", "NTA - and \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence.", ">If her friends and family are getting in your case for not helping her, let them know that they are welcome to come help her.\n\nThank you for volunteering - let me know when you\\`ll be here to do her laundry, and when will you cook? if you cook for both of us, i will reimburse you of course for my part.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! It\u2019s not like autistic people can\u2019t do things themself, she\u2019s just a total jerk whose supporting the idea that autistic people are incompetent.", "Nta. She's weaponizing her autism and she knows it. If it becomes more of an issue take it up with someone higher if the RA or anyone doesn't address it.", "You need to speak to you RA like right now because your concerns are valid but without a nuanced discussion will never be heard. You have a legitimate reason to move rooms, so please follow up on that before there's more damage to your mental hygeine.", "Talk to your ra and if that doesn't work, escalated to someone higher up. You should not have to take care of your autistic roommate in any way. A roommate is just that - someone who shares your room.", "Fantastic show. And excellent point. Roomie isn\u2019t incapacitated; she\u2019s autistic. She did just fine before OP was forced into the role of caregiver. \n\nNTA, OP. Do whatever you can to get out of this arrangement. It\u2019s not fair to either of you. She\u2019s weaponizing her autism to get out of doing normal things that everyone has to do for themselves, and your job is your education - no more, no less, and you\u2019re being kept from focusing on that.", "If anyone gives you grief ask them what day they\u2019re going to cook for her", ">they\u2019re taking advantage of OP by using their disability as a way to get out of doing things.\n\nEither that, or she\\`s been trained by her enabling family to be helpless - and that is abuse, plain and simple.\n\nBut - be that as it may - still not on OP (for this discussion a mere student) to act as licensed and trained caregiver at her own cost.", "Then roommate needs to get more formal accommodations.", "If she lives in a dormitory with neurotypical people, she can take care of herself just fine. Otherwise she would've got another type of accommodation", "This is beyond what an RA can handle and might end up causing OP more problems. I would go to student services and talk to them about how this is impacting your mental health. They are the ones who need to work with a student to provide reasonable accommodations if warranted (or tell them they are not reasonable), not other students.", ">  if they want the help they better pay the bill\n\nThe OP isn't available to provide care services, even if paid. This idea of yours sends the wrong message.", "Yep! And if they\u2019re going to make these kinds of concessions for someone who has proven to be capable, they might as well cook for you, clean up after you, and do your laundry, as well.", "Yeah, she was looking after herself fine until other people started babying her.", "I agree.  It\u2019s not OPs job to take care of her. But a lot of people with capacity deficits don\u2019t find out about them until leaving home for the same time.", "Yeah, OP is there to learn, not play nursemaid to her lazy roommate. If she gives in to this her studies will likely suffer for it.", "It was pretty obvious what they meant. Stop being pedantic", "Oh my wwwoorrrddd, stop looking for something to be offended about. Go back to Twitter if you wanna act like this.", "Everybody but you seem to got what they were talking about. I'm also neurodivergent btw", "To be honest - i think the amount of ND\\`s functioning more or less as \"normal people\" is larger - mostly due to some backwater countries not having the options to get support, or diagnosed properly - or only at great cost.\n\nWe (ND people) HAVE to mask / pretend to fit in - because NT are ill equipped to deal with people acting out of the norm, thinking differently or needing physical movements to regulate emotions. \n\nIt\\`s only since early this year I have my diagnosis - at 49 - though i knew longer  (waiting list and so).   \nThen there are large groups that can function with some assistance - or slight accommodations.\n\nThere is also a group that can\\`t really function independently at all - which is sad - but so far this group seems limited .. (depends on country, rate of diagnosis, general state of healthcare in said country etc) \n\nI think I can say that most, if not all, NT people think they know everything about ND people, even though they refuse in many cases to even allow them to have agency.. (such as the case of OPs roomie)"]}
