There are no words to describe the pain but I\u2019ve learned how to carry on and live with it. I do have an amazing daughter that makes it worth it. \n\nI have a friend we\u2019ll call Anne (55f). Anne never married or had kids. Every day Anne would message me and at some point in the conversation it turns to her not ever becoming a mother and how it\u2019s \u201ctriggering\u201d She is either complaining or crying how she never married or had kids. No fertility issues, no miscarriage etc. She\u2019s just very self centered and has trouble getting along with people \n\nThe issue is every time she\u2019s start talking about \u201cmourning the loss of the children she never got to conceive\u201d she says it that I understand because it\u2019s just like how I feel about losing Josh. If I was having a good day she\u2019d bring up my loss when talking about her stuff and it would be hard to deal with emotionally but I tried to be a good friend and be there for her.\n\nAnne has a friend well call Cara.  Cara is becoming a grandmother as her daughter is pregnant. Anne message me every day for a week screaming and crying because the word \u201cpregnancy\u201d triggers her and she\u2019s asked Cara not to say that word and refer to it as her daughters \u201csituation\u201d. Anne was yelling saying how she didn\u2019t want to hear about Cara\u2019s daughter\u2019s f*cking pregnancy. She\u2019s going on and as always SHE brings up my son. I don\u2019t talk about his death to many people. I talk about his life. I don\u2019t like to relive it more than I already do. \n\nAnne says \u201cWell, I never even got to have a child to lose\u201d\n\nLike wtf. I sent a message telling her that what she said was ignorant and hurtful in any context. This isn\u2019t a competition. I said his death isn\u2019t all about me. Hes not a figment of my imagination. He was a living, breathing, amazing human being that had his life ripped away at 22. To make like I\u2019m lucky to have the \u201cprivilege\u201d of losing my only son and isn\u2019t as bad as if I\u2019d never had kids set me off. I told her he wasn\u2019t my imagination or the thought of a child. I said the fact she won\u2019t allow people to even use the word pregnancy around her isn\u2019t normal. \nIn my message I said that she could adopt children - but I can\u2019t bring my son back.\n\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I overreacted.

No you did not overreact.  She is not your friend.  Letting her melodramatically blather at you and compare your very different situations just enables her rude and unacceptable behavior.  She doesn\u2019t want children of her own.  She just wants attention.  You and Cara both need to cut her off.", "NTA. Honestly, you underreacted. Please, give yourself a gift this Holiday Season; the gift of not having Anne in your life any more. She is a drama llama to the nth degree and needs to be treated as such. It's not hard to see why she never married, if her current behavior is par for the course. She's horrid.", "NTA. Firstly, I am sorry for your loss. I personally know the deep pain and mental anguish that comes with losing a loved one.\n\nAs to your friend, since she clearly feels comfortable sharing with you her feelings about not having children, you can share your feelings just as openly about how she talks about your son. It\u2019s a two-way street. \n\nHowever, it might not have been the most diplomatic thing for you to do, considering how emotionally charged this issue is for both of you. Your friend clearly is not blessed with a sense of what is appropriate to say and what is not.", "Hey would you ever have said to someone else who's grieving what Anne said to you? Likely no, because you're and most people are empathetic and care. \nYou're not overreacting at all. She was inappropriate. NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour friend constantly bringing up the death of your son has likely left you emotionally battered. I would have snapped long before.", "Why have you not blocked her years ago. ?\n\nNothing is worse than losing a child. Whether they are barely formed and you miscarry to what ever age they grow to. \n\nShe has a problem to put it politely.", "I understand your problem, my son was 18 but a friend like Anne would not have stayed my friend. Get rid of her, she is poison", "Absolutely NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nIt\u2019s been nine years since my brother passed away at the age of 22. My Mom has friends who grieve their missed opportunity to have children of their own but would NEVER dream of comparing that to my brother\u2019s death. Your friend needs some serious therapy. \n\nI am wishing you so much love and healing right now, I know the holidays can exacerbate feelings of grief when there\u2019s a loved one you wish was here to celebrate with you. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.  You have been more than patient with her.  It was well past time for you to put a stop to her self-centered rants.", "NTA. She would be not my friend for a loong time already. I'm sorry for your loss. Can't imagine.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, I am so so sorry for your loss.\n\nsecond: what the hell? Anne sounds like a monster. For the record I'm about her age and never had kids because I never wanted them. I don't regret that one bit. It sounds like she does but so fucking what, that has nothing to do with the raw grief you feel for your beloved son, who was a person who actually existed not a theoretical ideal of what could have been.\n\nYou didn't overreact at all. If anything you were unbelievably tasteful and understated in your response.\n\n\"She\u2019s just very self centered and has trouble getting along with people\"\n\nUnderstatement of the year. She sounds like a vicious narcissistic nightmare of a person.", "NTA and you\u2019re a better person than I am because I would\u2019ve clocked her in the face. Seriously, why are you even friends with this person? She sounds like such an emotional drain. I would never even dream of bringing up someone\u2019s deceased child in any type of context.", "This friend is grieving in her own way - but what she's grieving is the loss of opportunity to have that child.  To that end, I have sympathy and would tend to not minimize one person's grief as not be comparable to my own.  \n\nHaving said that, this friend is completely selfish and insensitive and out of line both in what she said to you and in what she expects of others.  She needs to see a counsellor herself to deal with her emotional issues cause she's clearly got them\n\nMy youngest was a few months shy of 24 when he died - so I know the pain you feel.  I dealt with a few boneheaded comments from people trying to make me feel better... (don't do that cause you will always say something insensitive) and I generally did not lash out as I understood what they were trying to do - but in your shoes, I'm not sure I would have reacted any better.  \n\nIF you overreacted, you were still NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He had a horrible relationship with his cop dad who disowned him so me being sad about my dad dying wasn\u2019t only foreign to him, it was upsetting. I would leave the hospital after visiting my dad to go over to his house to bring him dinner and cigarettes because he was broke, but he couldn\u2019t give two shits in the end.
