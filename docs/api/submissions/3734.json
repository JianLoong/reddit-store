Oh dude.... that's fucked up. I would be seriously reconsidering your relationship at this point.", "This is not about you vomitting in the car. This is about her not accepting your food sensory issues.\n\nDo you trust someone who on purpose feeds you food you can't eat without feeling sick?\n\nComming from a family with food sensory problems. If i put somewhere mushrooms in, I will tell. And if known in advance i buy the kind a mushroom they actually can eat (it is a little bit mroe pricey) Things like this. This is just one of the long list.  \n\n\nEdit NTA.  Food sensory issues is a real problem... Maybe next time try spitting it out of the window. But what happened, happened. And I hope she learned a lesson not to mess with it.", "NTA- even if it wasn\u2019t a sensory issue\u2026 even if it was simply you don\u2019t like it\u2026. You set a boundary that she continuously attempts to break. If it hasn\u2019t changed by now, it never will. Break away, and go find yourself someone who will respect you as a human enough to respect your boundaries.", "NTA. It is never okay to fuck with someone\u2019s food. That is a basic, simple rule that people don\u2019t seem to get.", "NTA, that's so fucked up of her to do. I'd go so far as to say it's abusive too.", "Yes you could have tried to get it out the window but she is completely out of line for trying  \"to help me stop being picky,\".  You are an adult who can decide they hate a particular food.   NTA and I would rethink this relationship.", "NTA, she knows your strong aversion and decided to trick you into eating it.  Annnnd that's how she found out how to steam clean her car.  Honestly, I'd be re-evaluating this entire relationship.  She doesn't respect boundaries and will go so far as to trick you.  What if she does the same to someone with a deadly food allergy because she thinks they're just dramatic?", "NTA That was a super messed up thing for her to do.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is for tricking you into eating something she is well aware you have issues with. Reminds me of asshole people who don't believe in food allergies, and try to sneak allergens into other's foods.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is fucked up and honestly mean.", "NTA.\n\nSomething similar happened to me - I'm sensitive to gluten, so I CAN swallow it and not notice a thing, but in an hour or two I get these cramps in my bowels that hurt to a point where I just bend over and am unable to move because of the stabbing pain.\n\nMy wife's grandma just doesnt believe me, since when I took a test for Celiacs, it came back negative (doc told me that for best results Id have to eat gluten for about two weeks before the tests come back fully positive, not willing to go through that), so she thinks Im making it up to feel special or something.\n\nSo almost every time we go to her place, she'll try to feed me stuff with flour in it and gets offended when I refuse to eat it. Last time she made potato soup. I asked her if she put any flour in it and she said no, so I happily eat away. An hour in, Im getting cramps and Im twisting on the floor in pain. Wife asks her if she's sure she didnt put any flour in and she goes \"Well, just a little bit, that can't be it, he probably ate something else before he came here!\" I'm NEVER eating anything from her ever again and refuse to talk to her now.\n\nI often remark how would she like it if I brought her come weed cookies or candy laced with LSD and didnt tell her about it. I know, overkill and very unethical, would never do it, but I fantasize about it when Im mad at her", "NTA\n\n\nYour gf is the asshole. Why would you stay with someone that crosses your boundaries?", "NTA, though ideally you could've spit it out the window instead. This doesn't make you an AH imo though, that's like stabbing someone then getting onto them for bleeding everywhere", "NTA - the fact your girlfriend did that to you is bad enough, but that she did it in her car and then had the nerve to be that mad at you is awful", "NTA.  \n  OP I have sensory issues with ADHD & food as well and I honestly just tell people I\u2019m allergic for exactly this reason.  I have the same issues particularly with mushrooms and seafood (though I\u2019m getting better exposing myself more at my own pace).  I also don\u2019t think you should be blamed too much for spitting it out in the car, since it is an involuntary action and you were looking for a napkin.  Like I said to someone else it\u2019s basically like vomiting - You might be able to hold it for a few seconds but it\u2019s a panic situation, and you even tried to find something to spit it into.  Yeah, too bad you didn\u2019t think of the window a little faster, but it happens.  \nI think you need to sit your partner down and explain to her that this isn\u2019t being picky - It\u2019s a involuntary reflex and it makes it literally impossible to get it down.  If she\u2019s open to the idea, some reading on ADHD that could be a good way to go.  SPD (sensory processing disorder) is also very common among adults with ADHD, and can go beyond foods to things like scratchy clothing or tags, etc\u2026\nThis is the first link I found, but it could be a good place to begin.  I would also try to bring up adult ADHD specific articles since it\u2019s quite new research and I wouldn\u2019t want her to continue infantalising you.  \nhttps://www.additudemag.com/women-with-sensory-processing-disorder/\n\nThat brings me to the final issue - Breaking up.    Yes it\u2019s a silly thing to break up over, and she probably thought she was being helpful in some way, but if it\u2019s a continuing issue or the latest in a string of similar events it borderlines abuse.  Her willingness to look into your condition and try to understand or at least be empathetic to your needs when you share with her will tell you what you need to know.  She needs to understand the real issue isn\u2019t spitting up in the car, it\u2019s that she basically caused your condition to flare up and she did so intentionally.  You\u2019re not a child and not just a picky eating toddler.  You need to be clear so she understands very firmly moving forward that this will be lifelong and not just a phase.  You may choose to eat some of these things if you so decide, but it will be on YOUR terms.   If she continues ignoring your needs then it might be time to consider breaking up.  I left my partner over something that was sort of silly when taken alone, but when looked back at (especially now with clearer eyes) I realise it was emotional abuse and a lack of empathy or attempt at understanding my ADHD and there was a real pattern of it throughout our entire relationship.  It wasn\u2019t what I wanted out of a partner.  This is her chance to show what kind of a partner she is to you.  \n\nBest of luck OP, you got this.", "NTA - I would seriously have a word with her about respect and boundaries or this behavior will not change.  That is so fucked up and there are no excuses that would make this better.  She knew what she was doing and just flat out didn't care.", "NTA. She doesn't deserve a boyfriend.", "NTA. She's lucky you didn't puke all over her car. It sounds like your girlfriend is deliberately refusing to understand the issue. I have similar food issues and will 100% throw up if I accidentally eat something that triggers it without knowing\n\nEven if you were just being picky, who is she to try to 'fix' you? Is it really that big of a deal if you don't like eggplant?", "NTA, that bizarre to force and trick you into eating foods she likes. That's not normal.", "NTA. She keeps blatantly ignoring your boundaries. You can do way better than her, she sounds incredibly abusive. She\u2019s more angry about what happened to her car than what happened to you. Think about that.", "NTA She purposely crossed a major boundary for you and it doesn\u2019t get more disrespectful than that. A partner that cares would never consider doing something like that. I would reevaluate the relationship because it would be hard to trust them again.", "Fuck her car seat and fuck her. As others have said go ahead and break up with her OP. She might \"love\" you but she sure af doesn't respect or listen to you. People like her really annoy tf out of me because they make ND things that are not personal and not even remotely about them(most of the time) and not only make it about them but also think its something they need to \"fix\".\n\nDon't let anyone convince you that this wasn't malicious on her part. Not fucking with people's food, or tricking them into eating something they can't have(doesn't matter the reason) is the bare minimum of human decency. \n\nNTA", "You are NTA, she tried to play a cruel food prank on you and frankly, getting her car messy was her own fault.", "NTA. I mean, offer to clean the car, but it's absolutely messed up for her to feed you something she KNOWS makes you gag. Like, wildly so. People without food/texture aversions sometimes can't or won't understand how bad it is. Like, your options were spit it out, or *throw up all over her car* if your aversions are as bad as mine can be. \n\nOne of these is a lot easier to clean up! It's the spitting it out! You made the best choice!\n\nHer being weird about you not eating eggplant is HER problem, not yours.", "NTA She knowingly served you something she knew would make you gag. She essentially tried to poison you. \n\nYou could've tried to spit it out the window, but she FAFO. Also, I imagine the anxiety was building as you tried to find a way to get rid of the offending food.\n\nWhat she does was such a breach of your boundaries, surrounding your mental health, and a breach of trust. How will she expect to be able to get you food ever again? I'm surprised you still consider her your gf honestly.", "NTA. You said to her that you couldn\u2019t handle the texture of it and she forced you anyway. People sensibilities are different and she should have understand", "ESH, mostly her. Regardless of your ADHD, your gf shouldn't try to make you eat something you don't want to for ANY reason. That's just childish, weird and rude. She's absolutely TA and you need to have a chat with her about respect.\n\nThat said though, you absolutely could have spit out the window.
