Now they are having a \u201esummer party\u201c where they will be celebrating both his and her birthday and their wedding. It is very informal, starts at 7pm and takes place in a pub. Food is just some wraps and they even allocated a budget where people have to pay for their own drinks at some point. There might be some children attending but only locally for an hour or two. Not ceremony or anything wedding-related.\nHusband and I have been debating to not attend for weeks and months due to several reasons, which is mostly because it is very challenging with our 1-year old toddler. The location is very child-unfriendly, rather small, no outdoor space (it\u2019s a pub). It starts at 7pm and even when we are stretching her bed time we could attend for maximum 2 hours. Which we would be happy to do, but the wedding is 8 hours drive (one way!) away. That means we need to cramp our kid into the car for 16 hours on a weekend to attend a party for 2 hours. In addition, my brother and me are not on good terms and have barely spoken since Christmas (where he told me, as a childfree person that I make everything around my child and use it as an excuse - Baby wasn\u2019t even a year old and I was a SAHM then). All of this gives me the biggest stomachache aches when I think about it.\nWhen I mentioned that I was thinking of not attending to my mom (for months), she told me that we need to suck it up, and kids were always attending weddings and should be a part of it (completely ignoring the specific circumstances). At some point she tried to command me to go (which I shut down - I am in my 30s). When I raised my thoughts to my brother he seemed upset and raised that he attended our wedding (which was indeed the same distance, but we had a ceremony, it was an entire day, big space that was child-friendly and also had foods, drinks etc, and of course they also didn\u2019t have kids to bring).\nI feel like an asshole for thinking about skipping the party, but driving for 16 hours to attend a casual \u201esummer party\u201c for 2 hours (spending of course a couple of hundred dollars), seems stressful. Also, if we don\u2019t go this will create lots of drama in the family.", "created_utc": 1694082945, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ccezf/aita_for_skipping_brothers_childunfriendly/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You want them to have what is basically their wedding reception at a Chuck E Cheese just so it's kid friendly?  Life does not revolve around kids and not your kid. This is an adult event. If you don't want to bring your kid, get a babysitter or don't go, just stop complaining.", "You absolutely don\u2019t have to go, but YTA for the attitude about it. Not everyone can afford the wedding you had. That doesn\u2019t make his day any less important than yours. Cool it with the judgment.\n\nAnd it\u2019s seriously weird that your primary complaint seems to be that the party is happening at night. It\u2019s not like anyone is specifically excluding your kid. Not everything is about your kid.", "YTA. There are all kind of solutions, but you just don\u2019t want them. You want everything like you did/want/expect, so your brother is right. Yes, you have the right to decline, but don\u2019t expect your relationship to heal. Because after all, it does all evolve around you and the toddler. \n\nNeed solutions? Go without toddlers daddy. Go and stay at parents/hotel/airbnb. Go, stay somewhere and leave toddler with his dad. Make it a family trip, some holiday to celebrate family and your brother.  \n\nOr make it the first couples weekend without. Ask someone you know (like in-laws) to take care of toddler and enjoy an weekend off child-duty. That  can look quite scary, but there are a lot of good people that can take really good care of the toddler and couples do benefit from being a couple again in stead of mam and dad.", "YTA \n\nThey are combining 3 parties in to one in a small venue with limited service. It sounds like the kind of thing people do when MONEY is a problem. You might call it a party but it is still their wedding. \n\nAnd If past 7PM that kid needs to be in bed any way so why would you care if has kid areas? Get a local hotel and rotate babysitting with your husband or just get a babysitter for the night. \n\nHonestly it sounds like your are just making excuses for why you CBA", "I was going to go with NAH until I got to the part about how your brother pointed out that you plan everything around your baby and use it as an excuse (which is probably true and also totally reasonable) but you\u2019ve held this comment against him for MONTHS and now you\u2019re being judgemental about his wedding (just because it\u2019s only a party doesn\u2019t make it not his wedding). I understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to bring a young child but there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t try to find childcare to leave the kid home or just go by yourself if that\u2019s not an option. Even if for whatever reason you just can\u2019t feasibly make it work YTA for being judgmental instead of apologetic and expressing disappointment that you\u2019re missing your brothers wedding.", "YTA. I kept waiting for the \u2018we can\u2019t find a babysitter\u2019 or \u2018we can\u2019t take turns at the party because\u2026\u2019 and it never came, which means you could get a babysitter or take turns at the party. All three of you go for two hours. Then hubby takes kid and you stay, or maybe you take kid so hubby can have a break and then you come back\u2026 this is what all the couples in my family do for events like this. You seem to be using your kid for an excuse because you don\u2019t want to drive. I understand not wanting to drive, but if your brother did it for you, you should do it for him.", "YTA - I get that not everyone understands how hard it is when a baby is small and how even a simple task becomes so much harder but there are ways to attend your brothers wedding. Using the child as the sole excuse is ridiculous. \n\nYou could easily get a hotel room, Airbnb etc. 8 hours is a long way even without kids. I live 5 hours from family and I never drive there and back in one day. That sounds insane. If you don\u2019t want to stay the night than your husband and baby can stay home and you can attend the wedding by yourself. It seems to me you don\u2019t really want to go.  Most parents would jump at the chance to have a night off on their own. \n\nYour title makes you sound entitled too. My wedding was a large traditional wedding in a \u201ckid-friendly\u201d environment and I did not allow kids. I don\u2019t have them and I don\u2019t want them there. The fact that he is even allowing children to be there is very kind of him. Just because he opted to not cater to your version of a wedding doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not meaningful to him and his partner. Suck it up and go to the wedding. Or don\u2019t and know that you could have made it work and chose not to.", "NTA\n\nIm childfree and I wouldn't be bothered to drive 16 hours to attend what is basically a happy hour. Screw that I'm lazy.", "ESH: simply decline and stop using your child as an excuse. No, is a complete sentence.", "YTA  Just decline the invitation and then say nothing else.  You obviously don't want to go, and I don't believe it has anything to do with your kid.  Just be sure you understand that there are consequences to every decision we make in life.  Be prepared for them and don't complain about them when they come.  As they surely will.", "NAH. He can have the wedding he wants, but it doesn't sounds worth it to me to try to take your daughter either. If you're really torn about the potential rift, I'd really just consider going while your husband and daughter stay home. No sense in dragging the whole fam there if it's going to be more exhausting for everyone that way. With an 8 hour trip, cutting it down to one person may also make it more affordable to fly and rent a car or taxi/Uber for that short amount of time.", "Can't decide if NAH or ESH\n\nYeah, if you don't go it might be perceived as a bit shitty. He's your brother and this is his wedding, whether it's \"formal\" or not, it's not JUST a \"summer party\" - it's his wedding; you sound really judgemental on his choice to have a relaxed, not-blowing-the-budget event. His wedding matters just as much as yours does, despite you spending more money on yours. He clearly wants you there, otherwise he wouldn't be upset about you not attending, however, I can understand that it's a pain in the ass, that it'll cost a chunk of money and that it's not super feasible for you and your family right now. Then again, I think weddings are almost ALWAYS a pain in the ass and costly for guests to attend, at least in my experience. \n\nIt sounds like you don't want to go and you're looking for every excuse to ensure you're not an AH about it. You just don't want to go. You don't HAVE to go - all of your reasons for not going are valid, but unfortunately yes, you'll still have to expect your family to be a bit upset if you don't.", "ESH\n\nThat's a very long winded NO.\n\nIf you wanted to go you would find a way to make it happen.", "YTA. Either get a babysitter or just don\u2019t go and stop trying to be familial with your brother. You clearly don\u2019t even like him. He\u2019s absolutely right about you using your kid as an excuse for everything. Can you admit to yourself that you don\u2019t wanna go bc you just don\u2019t like him and it\u2019s not the kind of wedding party you\u2019d throw? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re mad bc your brother is calling out your BS.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could leave your baby and husband home and go alone. \n\nSecond the real reason you seem to not want to go is because you look down on their wedding.

Your mother should know better, she had kids", "NTA - The circumstances of your wedding and your brother's wedding are totally different.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with child free / not child friendly weddings and I don't think weddings should have to cater to kids. But by the same token, that's going to rule some people out of coming and you have to take it on the chin as the bride and groom. Also, if it's a huge journey to the wedding, that will also rule some people out of coming.\n\nI think it's unreasonable to assume that everyone is going to be able to travel to what is essentially a party in a pub.

Your life does revolve around your kid, you're brother is right about that. That is parenthood, especially when the kids are so young. That does not need to be a problem for either of you.

That is hurtful. At least try to make it up to him some other way.", "Sorry but I think you are partly an AH here. \n\nIt's not a matter for ceremony but a matter of participating in their event that they have organised. However extravagant or low key. \n\nThey have obviously wanted your presence there and your brother was hurt when you mentioned you may not go.\n\nI think you can use the excuse of the cild and not travel. Which is legit but you will lose more of your already fractured relationship with your brother. \n\nSometimes for our loved ones we do make compromises but if this a stretch too far then you should not go.\n\n It would be awful all around if you trek all the way there and back and while you are there, everyone knows you are unhappy to be there.

I just used it as an explanation that it was a whole day event, which in my opinion sheds a different light on the commute. And they wanted to have this type of party because it\u2019s how they want to celebrate. It has nothing to do with money. I absolutely think they can choose the type of celebration they want. Bit in this case it is under circumstances that make it hard for me to attend under my current life circumstances.", "You are right about the part of our relationship to heal and that\u2019s why I have asked here. We have still a hotel booked, I have still PTO, we haven\u2019t communicated that we are not going. I am still in my decision process.", "I understand how you could think that money is the issue. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s their personal preference to have it that way (which is ok) and they also themselves don\u2019t call it wedding. That\u2019s why I have mentioned it", "Childcare over night is not a thing here. MIL lives overseas, my parents are attending the party. I don\u2019t have friends that I can leave my child with for 2-3 nights. \nBut I do understand that my hurt over the state of our relationship comes out as judgment. I guess it\u2019s a coping mechanism to distance myself from admitting that I am still hurt about his comments (there were multiple) and his lack of contact. I haven\u2019t realized that myself.", "Well you specifically state it would be a 16 hour drive but 8 hours each and spending the night isn\u2019t horrible. And if you don\u2019t want to deal with it with a kid then you can go by yourself or get a baby sitter. If you really wanted to attend you would make it work. My best friend flew from a different state to be at mine and had to bring her two children and got a baby sitter since kids weren\u2019t allowed. It\u2019s doable if you want to be there for your loved ones.", "It is an 8 hour drive without traffic and and stops, one way. That easily turns out to be 10 hours. I would not take a roundtrip in a day but of course have a hotel booked. Still a 10 hour car trip in one day is a lot, you have just said that you wouldn\u2019t do it.", "Same.  That's a very long drive for a few drinks and a wrap.", "It has everything to do with dragging a one-year-old child on an 8 hour ordeal both ways to go to a pub for a couple of hours.  Changing diapers, feeding times, etc. on a long car ride are awful, particularly if the toddler decides it needs something in the middle of an empty stretch of highway.  Plus you need to keep the kid entertained for the whole trip, or else you will be hearing about it.  Loudly.  Possibly for hours.\n\nEven without kids I would likely skip driving to a pub for hours  before heading back the next day.  They can go out for dinner next time they are all in the same town.", "Wow. You're a dick if you really think like this.", "Yes I am worried about the rift. Not dragging them along is also not a perfect option, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable driving there (I am anxious to drive in big cities) and it\u2019s also our anniversary. But I am opening up to the idea of finding different solutions.", "No I actually like him a lot and we used to be very close until last Christmas, and were talking on the phone regularly for hours.

The problem is you throwing shade at your brother's child-unfriendly, birthday/wedding extravaganza, which may have only a couple of local children,  serve nothing but peasant food (aka wraps), and possibly might maybe even make you pay for some of your own drinks. You should have said no months ago, like as soon as you found out you should have said no. Now instead youve sat on it for months, without saying anything at all to your bro who you were so close with (until he called you out on your victim tendencies or whatever), and when you finally do say something you blame the kid, and **thats why** your the big smelly asshole here.   \n\n  \n\nIf your kid is only one theyre probably not walking around a whole lot, & theyre still eating mostly formula/being breastfed while spending their days (and nights) mostly sleeping, (like 14+ hours a day), eating, and pooing. Sure, theres a little peekaboo or patty cake mixed in throughout the day, maybe some light reading idk... I do not understand people saying traveling with a child that young is soooo hard like the kid is going to open the car door and run while laughing and screaming 'get me, get me' or signal for help from passing motorist lol, fucking kid is gonna sit there.     \n  \n\n\nWhy cant you fly?? I live four hours from Las Vegas, Nevada in a small town called Los Angeles and its legit is cheaper to fly to Vegas from here than it is to get a rental, by a lot.

Youve already said spending hundreds of dollars so why not spend it smart and fly??   \n\n  \n\nWhy cant you go without your husband to the birthday bash?? He could make the 8 hour drive with you & the kid then sight see or something for a couple hours while you get ghetto with your brother...", "This comment of yours is a lot more reasonably phrased than your original post.

That\u2019ll take the fire out of the fight about kids. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to/I\u2019m unable to/I\u2019m unavailable to drive 16 hours to spend 2 hours celebrating. I\u2019m very happy for you, and I would love to celebrate you and your spouse when we are together again. Can I please offer to take you out for drinks or dinner when we do?\u201d\n\nUsing your kid as a reason will backfire with certain people, ie your family. They\u2019ve made their positions clear with whatever happened last Christmas when your brother got upset. They\u2019ve made it clear with you using that as a reason to not go. Learn from that. Quite frankly, I, as well as many others, wouldn\u2019t want to make that drive in a weekend either, kids or not. It\u2019s an unreasonable turnaround time and cost.", "So have your husband stay home with your kid or don't go. You obviously don't want to and are using your child as an easy excuse. Exactly like your brother said - not everything is about your kid. Be honest with yourself.", "Haha yes. \n\nNot a wedding, but earlier year my mom complained that I didn't drive 5 hours each way (and pay for a hotel) to attend her family's Easter celebration... Which was literally just her sister saying \"stop by for dessert\". \n\nJust no. NTA. But don't make it about their choice of venue specifically, just say it \"won't work for your family\".", "So you\u2019re punishing him for what he said about you last Christmas by basically doing the exact thing he said you did (use your kid as an excuse)? Boy, that\u2019ll show him!", "OP is in her thirties but her mother thinks that she can command her to do what she wants. That's enough on its own.\n\nWhen OP tried to explain why it was difficult, her mother ignored her. The phrase \"suck it up\" is very dismissive and unhelpful; she seems to think that an eight hour journey (one way) with such a young child isn't a problem. She seems to have very little care or consideration for her daughter.\n\nThis isn't even for a  wedding - it's an informal gathering at a pub on an evening. However, OP's mother referred to children at weddings which makes it sound as if she doesn't really understand what's going to happen.", "Like I said, saving money is not his main motivator. He is like in the Top5% income bracket. I know that because he tells that often. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thank you for your comment. For me it\u2019s difficult because I have now to consider also a different person who is still little at the moment. Things will obviously change over the years. But now I get betet that this explanation does not resonate with everyone.", "It\u2019s our anniversary the next day. I\u2018d prefer to spend that day with my husband which I think is fairly reasonable.", "No it just adds to the puzzle that everything is very very stressful. It seems like my family has to put up with a lot of stress without feeling very welcomed.", "Me to, which is why I can tell you its a thing. Even if its not the main thing", "It doesn\u2019t sound like a puzzle at all. It sounds like your brother called you out on something nearly a year ago; you don\u2019t want to admit he\u2019s right and you\u2019re still mad about it; and the only stress you have is that of your own making.", "I absolutely get where this is coming from. But since then he has not really spoken to me except for copy and paste messages he sent to everyone. I have tried to reach out multiple times and got very short answers. He has also initially ghosted everyone in the family for about 1-2 months and hasn\u2019t responded to any communication attempts (nobody got a heads-up that he needs time for himself, he just hasn\u2019t responded to any text messages and phone calls). I think it\u2019s absolutely ok to need a break. But it\u2019s a bit heartbreaking to be left without any explanation if not any big fight or anything has happened."]}
