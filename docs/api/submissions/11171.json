My son\u2019s wife unfortunately passed away 2.5 years ago and we were all devastated for my son and their 2 very young kids (5M and 6F) who just lost their mom. Also, they went from being a 2 income household to a 1 income household and being buried under a pile of bills. \n\nWhile my son sorted out his finances, he moved into a 1 bedroom apartment near his work in the city and the grandkids came to live with me, about 1.5hrs by train commuter train away in the suburbs. He comes to stay with us every Friday night - Sunday night before going back to the city for work. They\u2019ve been living with me for a little over 2 years, and I\u2019ve covered most of their expenses willingly. \n\nMy daughter has taken offense to this. She thinks since I am proving free childcare for her brother, I should also do so for her. When she first brought it up a year ago, I gently told her that she was a 2 income 2 parent household, and she wanted childcare so she could have fun, while her brother had lost his wife, the children their mother, and he needed the help. Since then she\u2019s complained multiple times about how I play favorites with her brother. I continue to explain that while I love her and her brother equally, her brother\u2019s children needs my help far more than her children. I still visit, send equally generous gifts to them on birthdays and holidays, and I call them frequently to FaceTime. \n\nRecently my daughter said if I wasn\u2019t willing to help with childcare, I should be spending an equal amount of money on her kids. She said inflation is hard and she is struggling too. I again told her I wasn\u2019t helping her brother\u2019s kids because I had spare money or because it was for fun, but because they lost their mother, and half their family income. In addition, her husband regularly sends money home to his parents in India, so I told her if they can afford to give away money, my help wasn\u2019t a necessity, and rather to fund their generosity. \n\nThat made my daughter extremely angry and said that family helps family, which is what her husband was doing. I tried again to gently explain that if she was struggling, it was her husband\u2019s duty to put them first and his extended family second. That went over poorly and she\u2019s been calling me an asshole, and recently even made a Facebook post on how her brother is the golden child and she\u2019s the scapegoat. \n\nIn turn my son now feels extremely guilty, and has suggested taking his children back to the city to live with him so I could go babysit my daughter\u2019s kids. He said he could stretch his budget and get a 2 bedroom apartment to get by. \n\nI feel strongly that I am not biased. Had the same tragedy befallen my daughter and the situation been reversed I would\u2019ve done the same. However, my son\u2019s offer is making me pause. My husband (their father) fully agrees with me on this, so I\u2019m asking Reddit, AITA and should I send my son\u2019s kids back to him to babysit my daughter\u2019s?", "created_utc": 1677615374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eio8m/aita_for_providing_financial_support_and_help_for/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Close enough to you and your husband that you can if there is an emergency (he gets sick, the kids get sick, whatever.) \n\nthe kids are school age now, right? so they could do after school programs or you could pick them up and watch them until dad comes home. but it'd mean that your son would start becoming a daily parent again. financially and emotionally. which is something that he needs to start figuring out.\n\nHeck, I have coworkers who did 1.5 hour commutes each way for years.

Yes, your children have different financial situations, and your daughter isn't entitled to the same supports you are providing your son, but it very much does seem like you've been favoring one set of grandchildren over the other.

Sounds like your daughter is hearing from both you and her husband that other people's needs are a higher priority than hers. It may well be true that both her brother and her in-laws are in more need of help than she is, but I'd try and cut her some slack if she's not behaving her best.

Just because her husband is sending money to India doesn't mean that they have a surplus. He may have cultural obligations that you aren't familiar with or family members in a worse financial state than his American family is so he needs to prioritize that and this could be really frustrating for your daughter.

You're in the clear there. However it's been two years and the situation has gone from \"whilst he sorts out his finances\" to \"this is life now\".\n\nIf your son was a woman he would have been expected to learn how to become a single parent, with or without help. And it would be rough sometimes but that's when you step in if you want to help, either with a night or two so he can sleep, or a loan if you can afford one and he needs it. But the majority of the time he should be parenting.\n\nWhat you're doing isn't helping. It's taking over. You've allowed your son to turn you into the de facto parental figures - from experience with widows and widowers I suspect that if he allowed this he let his wife be primary carer and now you've helped out by taking over that role. He needs to do it himself, even if it's rough. He needs to learn to parent alone - you're going to need to do a slow transition because it's been two years, but it needs to happen.", "NTA.

You are a wonderful parent and grandparent, and it's good to see.\n\nHowever, I suggest that after more than two years, your widowed som should have recovered his equilibrium by now, and it would be appropriate for him to take steps towards becoming a full-time father again.  It would be a good idea to explore with your son how he can manage as a single parent\u2014with your help, but not so much involvement.\n\nThis would, eventually, free you up to consider whether you want to spend more time with your daughter's children, or more money on, well, your son-in-law's parents.  I'd be hesitant, because your daughter has been viciously selfish in a situation where she ought to have had love and sympathy for her motherless niblings, and perhaps could have extended her own hospitality to them occasionally.  Frankly, I would be ashamed of her if she were my child.\n\nYour daughter is flat-out wrong.  You say you tried to explain gently\u2014well, try to explain with a two-by-four next time, because she is unreasonable as well as unkind.  Be extremely blunt.

My son\u2019s wife unfortunately passed away 2.5 years ago and we were all devastated for my son and their 2 very young kids (5M and 6F) who just lost their mom. Also, they went from being a 2 income household to a 1 income household and being buried under a pile of bills. \n\nWhile my son sorted out his finances, he moved into a 1 bedroom apartment near his work in the city and the grandkids came to live with me, about 1.5hrs by train commuter train away in the suburbs. He comes to stay with us every Friday night - Sunday night before going back to the city for work. They\u2019ve been living with me for a little over 2 years, and I\u2019ve covered most of their expenses willingly. \n\nMy daughter has taken offense to this. She thinks since I am proving free childcare for her brother, I should also do so for her. When she first brought it up a year ago, I gently told her that she was a 2 income 2 parent household, and she wanted childcare so she could have fun, while her brother had lost his wife, the children their mother, and he needed the help. Since then she\u2019s complained multiple times about how I play favorites with her brother. I continue to explain that while I love her and her brother equally, her brother\u2019s children needs my help far more than her children. I still visit, send equally generous gifts to them on birthdays and holidays, and I call them frequently to FaceTime. \n\nRecently my daughter said if I wasn\u2019t willing to help with childcare, I should be spending an equal amount of money on her kids.

I again told her I wasn\u2019t helping her brother\u2019s kids because I had spare money or because it was for fun, but because they lost their mother, and half their family income.

I think there is more to this story and their family dynamic.\n\nIf I were the daughter, I would never, ever go to the dad at this point for help. I have been in a similar situation...and the dad is like figure it out. Which has made me a person who will never seek help if needed. In my perspective, my father showed me who valued. It was never me. Parent's have favorites.  I can sympathize with the daughter.", "I thought the same.", "We do have our daughter\u2019s kids visit us throughout the year. Maybe I\u2019ll try to budget for a big vacation to take all the grandkids somewhere fun and let my daughter have break. I\u2019m open to compromises, that\u2019s a great idea, thank you.", "Precisely this.  At the 2 year mark dad should have a better handle on a plan for the kids.  The fact that they are at the 2 year mark and appear to have zero exit strategy isn't a good sign.\n\nThe kids need to be with their dad.  Weekends aren't enough.  They already lost a mom, they shouldn't have to feel like they are missing dad too.\n\nIn major cities,  a 1.5 hour commute is nothing. \n\nHave the kids had therapy? The longer they enmesh with grandparents the harder reunification is going to be.  At 1.5 hours out, they are not going to be in the same school. \n\nDid they switch schools to live with grandparents? So now they are gonna have to switch again when dad takes them back?\n\nAfter 2 years with no exit strategy,  I can see why sister is pissed.  Maybe she needs you too.  Something tells me op isn't really that that much if an insider with the daughters life, which might also be the problem. I see lots of assumptions about their jobs and what their salaries are like. Thanks to covid and the recession, their understanding could be woefully out of date.\n\nI feel foe them. At some point professionals need to get involved and help plan what happens next foe the kids. One way or another,  their care givers for the last 2 years will be dad again, and they wont be living with grandparents. And given that means another move, it's just more trauma for 2 little kids who won't understand the big picture of what is happening.", "Or time", "It's petty and I love it!", "Came to say this myself, or shouldn't she be giving it the brother, whats that i hear crickets oh yh colour me surprised........ not", "Yeah I don't get why the kids were separated so much.  They could have been a great source of comfort. Instead it seems like 2 families,  2 rules of engagement.", "Totally agree.  I wonder if what daughter's is that her problems aren't bad so suck it up.\n\nNo one likes to hear that.  Just because she didn't lose a spouse doesn't mean she might not need help.  \n\nAnd then her kids.  It Totally sucks to be the grandkids on the back burner, even if the reasons are noble.  Little kids don't get tragedy occurred.  They just know that they didn't really matter as much, because that is what it feels like to them. Or at least that is what my childhood scars look like.  Lol.\n\nKids don't get it.  They don't see a hierarchy or needs.  It just feels like they didn't love me enough.", "I\u2019m not sure. I guess she could be frustrated with her husband but feels unable to set boundaries with him, so she is taking it out on me? I will go ask her about that, although I doubt it will be well received. She seems to take anything I say on that subject as an attack.", "The daughter opened the money can of worms by saying times were tough.  I agree times are tough, but before asking for money from her parents her family needs to decide priorities, send money to family in India or use money for their immediate needs.", "I'm far more disturbed by her apparent lack of empathy", "Lmaooo she shouldn\u2019t ask for help when she can afford to be generous to family. No one is forcing then to send money and struggle", "This is not always true. I have family in india with great jobs but they still expect their children to send them money because it\u2019s a societal expectation. My in-laws\u2019 family there also chooses not to work because they think if you live in the US you can also fund their lives back home.", "If he wasn\u2019t helping his son, are you insinuating he would be neglecting both of his kids then? If he\u2019s helping one with extreme circumstances and not the other who doesn\u2019t have extenuating circumstances, sounds like he would be neglecting (in your eyes) all around for not sending both kids money\u2026\u2026..????", " If you\u2019re struggling to make ends meet you shouldn\u2019t be sending money to anyone.

I was just wondering if we were gonna see another thread with the daughter pulling back the curtain.\n\nThis is a pretty terrible situation all the way around.  What concerns me most are 2 things: by ops own word, the daughter has been reaching out for over a year saying she needs help but op won't even hear her out, just dismisses her because other people's needs are greater.  2) the kids have been separated from their dad for over 2 years now without any kind of exit strategy.   Which tells me the kids haven't been in therapy.   So Two kids who lost their mom also lost dad full time.  When he gets them back full time, it will be a new house, new room, new school,  new church,  new friends, every bit of it, just by virtue of being 2.5 hours away by commuter train.\n\nAnyone who doesn't see that as a giant load of new trauma hasn't worked with kids.  They lost mom, they lost 24 hour access to dad, and when dad gets them full time again, they lose 24 hour access to their caregivers of 2.5 years, which at this point might be all they remember. \n\nThis isn't good.  All the way around.", "I don't even know that it has to be an expensive or \"destination\" vacation, if that would make other things tight, monetarily.  You don't say how old her kids are, but a \"suite\" style hotel in a boring midwestern town that has a zoo and a science center would be an absolute blast for the 5 and 6 YOs.  Fill in the other days with movies, ice cream for lunch, public parks with good playgrounds, etc., and you can have a lot of fun for not much cash with kids that age.", "Just curious, since your daughter sated that \u201cfamily helps each other\u201d what is she doing to help her brother and his kids?", "Do you actually spend time with your other grandkids without their cousins?", "Throughout the year?

Can you see as a mom how you might be concerned that their kids aren't going to have any kind if relationship with grandparents because they have been so focused on the other kids?\n\nOut if curiosity,  when your daughters kids come over, are they the only grandkids there?\n\nIf the adults in this situation are struggling,  can you imagine what all the kids are feeling?\n\nYou might think your daughter sucks, but her kids likely just miss grandparents.  You see the other ones every day.  And her kids, as you describe,  a couple times thru the year.  If they are geographically close to you, how do you think the other grand kids feel?\n\nBecause you really haven't talked about them at all.", "Just tell your daughter you\u2019ll be happy to help her out if her husband should tragically die.", "I do agree with this. I will say that I have a friend whose husband died unexpectedly and her mom moved in with her to care for her kids. I agree that parent and kids should be together but a long ish term plan might be a home with dad, grandma, kids. But grandma should also be visiting with her other grandkids so they can know her and she isn\u2019t solely focused on just one set.", "I was hoping someone addressed this. \nAnd I am very sympathetic to someone losing my spouse, I lost mine with a four year old and a 5 week old. We did move in with my parents for about four months that way I could have help if I needed it while I got into the \u2018only parent\u2019 mode. \nThose children really should have a father and be together.", "Or that after 2 plus years, her kids miss you? Or that she and her hubs are legit struggling?  That uou don't seem to know if this is the case speaks to how you have separated her and your son.\n\nWhy didnt all the kids get together more?", "Absolutely, nobody is entitled to free childcare. She can shove it.\n\nYour son needed the help. In which you offered to take them. To have him pay down his debts.\n\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't feel bad. The entitlement would put me off of every baby sitting or sending money. She views you as her personal babysitter and spender.\n\nThe son suffered a huge tragedy.  This is a necessity. \n\nIt isn't fun time.\n\n\nNta\n\n\nAlso her going to social media. She is a double ah for that.", "We all agreed her daughter is being irrational.  \n\n... just because OP's daughter is showing argumentative tendencies doesn't justify argumentative tendencies of her own. \n\n\"This is how it is, this is how I am looking at it, you're welcome to share your thoughts, they will be validated, but this is how we're moving forward.  We love you.\"", "Depending on how badly his extended family needs support.. \n\nThere's not much of a choice when your options are \"send money or your parents starve and die.\". It's also ridiculous to cry poverty if he's buying brand name luxury goods for his extended family while his own kids struggle.", "I\u2019m not even trying to sound mean, but those kids lost both their parents. They aren\u2019t living with their dad nor being raised by him. Two years is a long time to not have your parent that\u2019s alive.", "I\u2019m not agreeing with it, I am saying that is common in Indian tradition, and I doubt this is new to her. My ex-boyfriend is from India, he told me I would never come before his mother or father (who still lived in India) and I ended it because that didn\u2019t align with my values", "OP is literally judging him for doing that", "So do some parents. They get so focused on one kid. You better believe that if the child that is not favorite has an issue it is swept under the rug and they are left to deal with it on their own. Been there. One good thing comes from it....you don't owe them anything and you can live your life free from them. So in away, it is good for the daughter that dad showed her who he really is. No illusions anymore. She solve her problems on her own. Her brother will always need help. Sure, it is sad his wife died. Life happens and you adjust. But the son will look to daddy to fix his problems. What will he do when his dad is no longer around?", "You're assuming the kids aren't in therapy & that they'll move to the city. You're also assuming there's no exit plan in place. \n\nThe sister & brother's situations in this aren't equal, and if OP says they can't afford to financially support a two parent household - you should believe them.", "Realistically, why would the daughter need to step up when the mom is raising and financing his children?", "I think OP is NTA but I can see how daughter wishes her kids can have more exposure to the grandparents. Even if the grandparents really love everyone equally, there is a special bond when you live with someone that is hard to hide and the kids definitely would pick up on it. Just the casual \"at home\" way you open a cupboard to get your cup when you actually live there, the way you dance around each other and know what the other person is reaching for without saying a word. And it can definitely make everyone else feel like they are intruding/the guest when they visit. And this bond is an absolute blessing and privilege to have especially with your grandparents and I can see why the sister want that for her kids even tho she is being completely unreasonable for demanding it.\n\nI like the idea of letting the brother take his own kids for a little getaway while grandma take sister's kids for a little getaway. As others have said, doesn't have to be extravagant. Hanging out at grandma's house doing fun things is fine. Going to the zoo together is fine. But that kind of alone time to get to know each other can really help.", "a lot of americans simply don't seem to get that. it's pretty common in indian culture for parents not to save for retirement, and instead spend all that money to give their kids a good start in life (education at the minimum, possibly help with first house or moving expenses, that sort of thing), with the understanding that the kids will then support them in their old age.\n\nthere *are* people who move to america, and get influenced enough by the local culture to say \"sorry, my spouse and kids need all the money i earn, i can't send any home\", leaving their parents in an extremely bad situation. OP's daughter and son-in-law are emphatically not the assholes for keeping up with that familial obligation, whatever the rights and wrongs of the rest of the case are.", "He works, the children would spend most of their time with a caregiver who they didn\u2019t know, expect for their evenings and they go to bed early, given their ages. Now, they are full time with their grandparents, and dad is there 24/7 on weekends to spend time with them.

My son moved out of their 3 bedroom apartment and lives in a small studio now to cut down on expenses. I feel like if she\u2019d cut down on sending money away, and she was still struggling, I would try to help her financially too.

Favored ones are taken care of to the point where they can not take care of themselves. Mommy and Daddy must take care of them and the their kids. Enough is enough, especially when the expectation is for the non favored to take on the burden of the favored child and his progeny. FT. I broke off contact with my family. They are dead to me. I can understand if the daughter does the same. \n\nNot every family gets along.
