My son\u2019s wife unfortunately passed away 2.5 years ago and we were all devastated for my son and their 2 very young kids (5M and 6F) who just lost their mom. Also, they went from being a 2 income household to a 1 income household and being buried under a pile of bills. \n\nWhile my son sorted out his finances, he moved into a 1 bedroom apartment near his work in the city and the grandkids came to live with me, about 1.5hrs by train commuter train away in the suburbs. He comes to stay with us every Friday night - Sunday night before going back to the city for work. They\u2019ve been living with me for a little over 2 years, and I\u2019ve covered most of their expenses willingly. \n\nMy daughter has taken offense to this. She thinks since I am proving free childcare for her brother, I should also do so for her. When she first brought it up a year ago, I gently told her that she was a 2 income 2 parent household, and she wanted childcare so she could have fun, while her brother had lost his wife, the children their mother, and he needed the help. Since then she\u2019s complained multiple times about how I play favorites with her brother. I continue to explain that while I love her and her brother equally, her brother\u2019s children needs my help far more than her children. I still visit, send equally generous gifts to them on birthdays and holidays, and I call them frequently to FaceTime. \n\nRecently my daughter said if I wasn\u2019t willing to help with childcare, I should be spending an equal amount of money on her kids. She said inflation is hard and she is struggling too. I again told her I wasn\u2019t helping her brother\u2019s kids because I had spare money or because it was for fun, but because they lost their mother, and half their family income. In addition, her husband regularly sends money home to his parents in India, so I told her if they can afford to give away money, my help wasn\u2019t a necessity, and rather to fund their generosity. \n\nThat made my daughter extremely angry and said that family helps family, which is what her husband was doing. I tried again to gently explain that if she was struggling, it was her husband\u2019s duty to put them first and his extended family second. That went over poorly and she\u2019s been calling me an asshole, and recently even made a Facebook post on how her brother is the golden child and she\u2019s the scapegoat. \n\nIn turn my son now feels extremely guilty, and has suggested taking his children back to the city to live with him so I could go babysit my daughter\u2019s kids. He said he could stretch his budget and get a 2 bedroom apartment to get by. \n\nI feel strongly that I am not biased. Had the same tragedy befallen my daughter and the situation been reversed I would\u2019ve done the same. However, my son\u2019s offer is making me pause. My husband (their father) fully agrees with me on this, so I\u2019m asking Reddit, AITA and should I send my son\u2019s kids back to him to babysit my daughter\u2019s?", "created_utc": 1677615374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eio8m/aita_for_providing_financial_support_and_help_for/", "score": 413, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it shouldn't be you. Maybe it's looking for housing in a suburb an hour from the city- close enough that he can commute home every night. Close enough to you and your husband that you can if there is an emergency (he gets sick, the kids get sick, whatever.) \n\nthe kids are school age now, right? so they could do after school programs or you could pick them up and watch them until dad comes home. but it'd mean that your son would start becoming a daily parent again. financially and emotionally. which is something that he needs to start figuring out.\n\nHeck, I have coworkers who did 1.5 hour commutes each way for years.

Yes, your children have different financial situations, and your daughter isn't entitled to the same supports you are providing your son, but it very much does seem like you've been favoring one set of grandchildren over the other. Especially if it's been over two years and your still raising one set of grandchildren.", "NTA, you are being an awesome mom and grand-mom. Your daughter is a massive AH, though", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter sounds entitled. I do understand where she's coming from tho. You mentioned you FaceTime her kids often, which is good, but it's not the same as being physically present with them.\n\nIt may be an opportunity to have the kids spend time together. Sometimes having more kids together makes it a bit easier cause they play with each other instead of you having to entertain them. I'm not saying for you to do it all the time but once a month perhaps?\n\nAlso, you may want to talk to your son in law and see his perspective - whether he's understanding or not.\n\nIf your daughter is petty enough to publically post on FB about how you're a bad dad, then she's gone off the rails. I don't think you'll be able to reach her rationally, and it'll have to be someone else, like her husband or her best friend.", "NAH. Sounds like your daughter is hearing from both you and her husband that other people's needs are a higher priority than hers. It may well be true that both her brother and her in-laws are in more need of help than she is, but I'd try and cut her some slack if she's not behaving her best. It is haaaarddd in ways that parents often miss to be the child that supposedly doesn't have problems/needs.", "NTA - It's atrocious that you daughter can't muster up some empathy for her brother and his kids, but if this behavior is at all out of character for her maybe you could provide a stronger listening ear to whatever struggles she is facing now that have her worried about money and lashing out? Just because her husband is sending money to India doesn't mean that they have a surplus. He may have cultural obligations that you aren't familiar with or family members in a worse financial state than his American family is so he needs to prioritize that and this could be really frustrating for your daughter. She is still totally in the wrong, but sometimes it's worth digging for the deeper issues.", "NTA but you shouldn't have made comments about their family or how they spend money, either. \n\nYou're the de facto guardians of your grandchildren, you're not divvying up the inheritance unequally. \n\nInsane for your daughter to feel this but but I'd like to hear her side of the story, too.\n\nKeep watching over these kids but also don't burden yourself with unnecessary fights with your daughter.  She'll either understand or she won't.  Its beyond trying to convince her.", "NTA. Your daughter is. I bet your son would give anything to have his wife and his children\u2019s mother back.

You're in the clear there. However it's been two years and the situation has gone from \"whilst he sorts out his finances\" to \"this is life now\".\n\nIf your son was a woman he would have been expected to learn how to become a single parent, with or without help. And it would be rough sometimes but that's when you step in if you want to help, either with a night or two so he can sleep, or a loan if you can afford one and he needs it. But the majority of the time he should be parenting.\n\nWhat you're doing isn't helping. It's taking over. You've allowed your son to turn you into the de facto parental figures - from experience with widows and widowers I suspect that if he allowed this he let his wife be primary carer and now you've helped out by taking over that role. He needs to do it himself, even if it's rough. He needs to learn to parent alone - you're going to need to do a slow transition because it's been two years, but it needs to happen.", "NTA. Tell her this: I am no longer discussing this with you. If you bring it up, I will cut the visit or call short.", "Info: exactly how much longer will you son be needing help?

You seem to be doing everything right, in horrible circumstances.  You are a wonderful parent and grandparent, and it's good to see.\n\nHowever, I suggest that after more than two years, your widowed som should have recovered his equilibrium by now, and it would be appropriate for him to take steps towards becoming a full-time father again.  It would be a good idea to explore with your son how he can manage as a single parent\u2014with your help, but not so much involvement.\n\nThis would, eventually, free you up to consider whether you want to spend more time with your daughter's children, or more money on, well, your son-in-law's parents.  I'd be hesitant, because your daughter has been viciously selfish in a situation where she ought to have had love and sympathy for her motherless niblings, and perhaps could have extended her own hospitality to them occasionally.  Frankly, I would be ashamed of her if she were my child.\n\nYour daughter is flat-out wrong.  You say you tried to explain gently\u2014well, try to explain with a two-by-four next time, because she is unreasonable as well as unkind.  Be extremely blunt.

My son\u2019s wife unfortunately passed away 2.5 years ago and we were all devastated for my son and their 2 very young kids (5M and 6F) who just lost their mom. Also, they went from being a 2 income household to a 1 income household and being buried under a pile of bills. \n\nWhile my son sorted out his finances, he moved into a 1 bedroom apartment near his work in the city and the grandkids came to live with me, about 1.5hrs by train commuter train away in the suburbs. He comes to stay with us every Friday night - Sunday night before going back to the city for work. They\u2019ve been living with me for a little over 2 years, and I\u2019ve covered most of their expenses willingly. \n\nMy daughter has taken offense to this. She thinks since I am proving free childcare for her brother, I should also do so for her. When she first brought it up a year ago, I gently told her that she was a 2 income 2 parent household, and she wanted childcare so she could have fun, while her brother had lost his wife, the children their mother, and he needed the help. Since then she\u2019s complained multiple times about how I play favorites with her brother. I continue to explain that while I love her and her brother equally, her brother\u2019s children needs my help far more than her children. I still visit, send equally generous gifts to them on birthdays and holidays, and I call them frequently to FaceTime. \n\nRecently my daughter said if I wasn\u2019t willing to help with childcare, I should be spending an equal amount of money on her kids. She said inflation is hard and she is struggling too. I again told her I wasn\u2019t helping her brother\u2019s kids because I had spare money or because it was for fun, but because they lost their mother, and half their family income. In addition, her husband regularly sends money home to his parents in India, so I told her if they can afford to give away money, my help wasn\u2019t a necessity, and rather to fund their generosity. \n\nThat made my daughter extremely angry and said that family helps family, which is what her husband was doing. I tried again to gently explain that if she was struggling, it was her husband\u2019s duty to put them first and his extended family second. That went over poorly and she\u2019s been calling me an asshole, and recently even made a Facebook post on how her brother is the golden child and she\u2019s the scapegoat. \n\nIn turn my son now feels extremely guilty, and has suggested taking his children back to the city to live with him so I could go babysit my daughter\u2019s kids. He said he could stretch his budget and get a 2 bedroom apartment to get by. \n\nI feel strongly that I am not biased.
