Very AH move. Some \u201cfriend\u201d. \n\nYou went through his phone. Not cool normally, but while AH material it is completely justified in this instance.

I doubt he's going to tell the friend, because then it's going to backfire on him about why he didn't tell her for so long.\n\nBoth you and him are AH for keeping her ignorant of this information and robbing her of the choice to make informed decisions relevant to her life.  She has a right to know if her friend is in love with her bf, and she also has a right to know if her bf has that knowledge and has kept it from her.

He loved having that video of you confessing your feelings waaaay too much. He wasn't rewatching it for laughs. He has some kind of conflicted feelings too. Or gets off on the self-esteem boost from having a gf AND sexual tension with gf's friend. He's also way too worried about what else you might have seen on his phone. Yikes!

He's toying with your emotions and taking advantage.", "NTA you dodged a bullet, but I'd consider being honest with your best friend (if you think she'll listen) because this man just showed his true colors and they are not good. I hope he hasn't manipulated the hell out of her yet and she's able to see the truth and escape.", "NTA - if he was any type of friend he\u2019d have deleted it when you asked, if he had more feelings for you than that he\u2019d have just spoken to you and explored them", "NTA. That\u2019s so manipulative. The watching it in front of you knowing it makes you uncomfortable really freaks me out.

If you acted on it, different story. \n\nYour \u201clove\u201d (hopefully no longer) is an AH because he is holding something over your head, and threatening you with it. \n\nTalk to your BF. Be honest, tell her you have (hopefully had now) feelings for her boyfriend and in a drunken vulnerable state you confessed your feelings. And that he recorded that drunk confession and held it over your head.  You found an opportunity to delete the video from his phone and you did. \n\nNow, I feel you like you have an AH vibe as you have feelings for a guy, and you hang out with him without your BF present. Not only hanging out with him, but getting drunk with/around him. I get you have been friends for a long time, but this is a recipe to ruin many friendships.", "NTA. That's messed up of him. You did what you had to do. But can we go back to two points?\n1 - how drunk were you in the video, and did you know at the time you were being recorded? Were you cognizant, or off your face?\n2 - can we not brush past his anger and fear that you might have looked at OTHER things on his phone? Sure, he may just have photos of his own pee-pee on there or whatever, but considering his behaviour,  I'd be wondering if he had other photos/videos of you on there.\nAlso, the cloud exists. Deleted isn't always deleted. Then again, he's angry you did it, so maybe he never uploaded it to cloud storage.", "NTA\n\nI would've done the same thing fr.

He is threatening to tell you what is on the video, so I need to tell you first. Basically while drunk I said that I had feelings for you. I do have feelings, but you are first and foremost only my friend. I've known you for longer than I've known what love is, and being the closest person of the opposite gender in my life growing up, at times in adolescence romantic love and friendship love got confused. Make no mistake I'm not here just 'waiting' for you. I love you as my best friend, and would never do anything to jeopardize that. I hope you can accept the fact that feelings may come and go given our entire history together, but that I only ever want you in my life as a friend. \\*\\*\\*OPTIONAL\\*\\*\\* If you ever wanted to discuss something more we could have a conversation about it, but I will never risk losing a friendship like ours for anything lesser\".", "NTA sounds like he's not really a friend at all", "NTA - he sounds like a giant ah.", "ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re playing the victim when you\u2019re the one who got drunk and said things you shouldn\u2019t have.

He'll twist the story.", "NTA fuck that guy. Imagine what he does with pics of his gf. I would literally stop crushing on that guy immediately for soooo many reasons. He\u2019s gross bud, just drop it.", "NTA he shouldve deleted it as soon as you asked", "NTA he took advantage of you while you were drunk and recorded it, even then if you refuse to delete a picture or video of a person while there is nothing inherently wrong with that imo, its disrespectful and frankly creepy", "your best friend know your feelings for him before she started dating him?", "NTA\u2026why are you crushing on a jerk?

I agree.  What kind of person would play that kind of emotional game with someone", "> without fully disclosing what you said in the video\n\nSurely you're not so naive to think there's any way OP's friend isn't going to find out OP took a shot?", "This right here. If your friend is a good one, she'll understand. She might be mad at you too, initially, but will understand. \n\nIf she chooses him over you, she's not really your friend and she's not one to herself, either, since she's choosing a dude who has threatened to blackmail you for not doing what he wants.", "> He was essentially blackmailing you. \n\nTo what end?

I'm actually shocked that people are siding with OP. Every bad move made in this scenario, was made by OP except the recording which, in my opinion, isn't even THAT BAD. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I don't think there's anything wrong with this guy deciding to open his phone to record OP especially if OP is considering his girlfriend their best friend. If my partner's \"BEST FRIEND\" was confessing their love for me wasted in a public setting (have to assume it was a public setting because if OP and the boyfriend were drunk alone, that's a completely different issue) then clearly, OP didn't care that much about who heard them. They're mad that they got caught not that the video existed.", "Thank you!! \n\nEveryone was jumping over how OP has betrayed her best friend, who is the actual victim here.\n\nHe's shit for the emotional manipulation, absolutely! Also, he's definitely using it as an ego boost; he should've already told his gf!\n\nBut OP thinks she's innocent but just doesn't want any repercussions for her admission.\n\nBoth of them make my stomach turn.\n\nESH.", "I love how you said \u201cwithout someone\u2019s permission\u201d.

He is getting off on watching her squirm.", "This reads like a possibly gay confession so maybe we shouldn't assume it's not blackmail", "You're right it's not blackmail it's emotional torture. At least blackmail would have a goal in mind rather than just holding something over someone's head for the fun of making them miserable.", "Yes, it is because the leverage is her best friend\u2019s ignorance about the video, unless she just let him keep taunting her with it and holding it over her.", "I agree that it's not blackmail but it could have easily turned into that if she hadn't deleted the video.", ">It's essentially not blackmail.\n\nExactly.\n\nCmon people... Let's tell the truth when we give advice!   Lying helps no one.", "You are right, but there isn't a word for this because people don't do it.", "Its called an ego boost my dear watson. Some people enjoy seeing other squirm", "Yeah there's definitely something not right here. I suspect he might have been egging her on in the video and getting her to spill her guts, taking advantage of her drunkeness. In which case he's an even bigger asshole!", "Well do you still like him now that you\u2019ve seen how he really acts?", "The fact that he's threatening to tell your best friend about this shows his true colors to you. It wasn't a matter of fun, it's a matter of having some kind of power over you.  \n\n\nIf your best friend is level headed with this kind of info, I'd recommend telling her yourself about what happened. About the video, about how he took it knowing you were in a vulnerable state and took it without your permission, how he plans to tell her because it was deleted, and that he claimed that it was backed up somewhere.  \n\n\nThis guy is really giving creep vibes, and it's better she hears this coming from you than from him. Take away his leverage against you, and hopefully she's wise enough to see the creep for who he really is as well.", "\"Being an ahole is sometimes justified.\"\n\nAbsolutely.", "Agreed. It's been discussed often that we need a judgement for JAH (justified asshole) or something similar.", "Exactly! Both OP and the bf are the AHs, making this an ESH situation. And I agree 100% that OP was more concerned about being caught confessing her love than anything else. I feel sorry for the BFF. She has a fake best friend who is drunkenly hitting on her man, and a man who is cruelty delighting in holding the friend\u2019s crush over her head rather than telling his girl and letting her decide what the best course of action is.", "Thats what ESH is for. Two wrongs dont make a right.", "> There is no excuse for taking a video or recording someone without their permission.\n\nLet's wind that back a bit, chief. \n\nIf someone is committing a crime against me, and I need evidence later, you bet your ass I'm recording it despite their objections.", "If OP's in the USA and in public setting *or* a one-party state, then her consent isn't required.

Not only isn't he a friend to OP, he's a pretty shit boyfriend to bff. A good guy would NEVER EVER have recorded this confession much less keep it because (checks notes) he finds it funny? A joke?

He's getting off on the power trip and mind games", "I suggested this too, but I will also admit that people like this tend to be REALLY charming and manipulative, and OP confessing to bff probably only has a long-term chance of potentially saving their friendship. Short-term, this guy is most likely to lie, lie, lie, and break up their friendship (regardless of who tells bff first) until he gets comfortable, starts showing this controlling side of himself, and bff finally sees it for herself.
