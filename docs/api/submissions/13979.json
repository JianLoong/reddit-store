I doubt he's going to tell the friend, because then it's going to backfire on him about why he didn't tell her for so long.\n\nBoth you and him are AH for keeping her ignorant of this information and robbing her of the choice to make informed decisions relevant to her life.  She has a right to know if her friend is in love with her bf, and she also has a right to know if her bf has that knowledge and has kept it from her.

He loved having that video of you confessing your feelings waaaay too much. He wasn't rewatching it for laughs. He has some kind of conflicted feelings too. Or gets off on the self-esteem boost from having a gf AND sexual tension with gf's friend. He's also way too worried about what else you might have seen on his phone. Yikes! That makes me suspicious.\n\nBut the way he handled this is definitely emotional blackmail. Huge red flag. Do not engage with this fucked up dynamic.

The fact that she was drunk is what gave her the courage to tell him. She could have hoped he was drunk enough to reciprocate which leads me to my next point: we don\u2019t know how drunk THIS guy was. So essentially what you\u2019re saying is it\u2019s fine that she did this because she was drunk. But whether this guy was drunk or sober (we don\u2019t know) the WORST he did was record her saying it. He didn\u2019t hit on her, he didn\u2019t try to sleep with her. He crossed zero lines except for the recording which, SO WHAT OF IT WAS BLACKMAIL?! The girlfriend needs to know that her \u201cbff\u201d is a dirtbag.", "I apologize if you took it that way- it was NOT intended to read like that, with that said- you think she had no part in it?

IMO a true friend should let you know about something like this.", "jsyk, this comment got downvoted because it got posted 3 times. just wanted to let you know so you're not confused, because it is a good comment!", "He is dating her BFF and she has feelings for him, he should tell her. I get more creepy vibes from OP...", "> I think you should tell her \"I was drunk one night and BF goaded me into saying things I'd never say sober\"\n\nYeah... someone coming along after the fact and trying to say that *he* was actually the aggressor is *exactly why the dude kept the video*.", "I completely agree!", "I am sure that you are 100% perfect in every way all,the time and your mind has never ever stayed to desiring something someone else thought you should not have. But for real humans If we all actually acted on what we wanted, and what we thought, and what we hoped then no relationship would be safe, and the world would be ankle deep in bodies. \n\nShe offered - which in a non-drunk state she would not have done - but she did not coerce him and did not take away any of his agency. Personally i\u2019d tell the bf and move on with my life - but he absolutely doesn\u2019t get a pass. \n\nI just love the way you think blackmail is OK - such an interesting take on priorities. But just in case you follow through on your chosen set of principles at any time its worth reminding you that telling someone you think you love them is perfectly normal, and completely legal, even if a little tacky if that person is in a relationship with a friend but blackmail is a crime.", "Exactly!", "And when you do so also let her know that any residual feeling you may have had have now died after seeing how he held this over your head and tormented you with it. You might lose both friends, that is a possibility and you can guarantee that he will lie through his teeth about this to paint himself in a good light but hopefully it doesn\u2019t destroy your friendship with her. Him, good riddance. NTA.", "I mean, I could see a couple valid reasons to keep it- such as debating if he should show his GF what her BFF said or wanting proof it happened in case OP starts being creepy (by, say, stealing his phone and going through it to \"delete files\"- from his perspective OPs behavior is likely both alarming and escalating).\n\nIf we flip the genders and have a man admitting to going through a woman's phone to delete evidence of incriminating behavior everyone would be (rightfully) calling him out for being a creep- even without the accusations of him looking through her personal data.\n\nOP might not have meant to do so but her behavior has veered solidly into the \"file a police report about\" category.", "Just because she wouldn't say it sober doesn't mean it isn't true.

I think he was filming so he had proof he never did anything in case I forgot what happened.\n\nAnother commenter: \n\n>> Were you suggesting you take a shower together? And he thought you wouldn't remember that it didn't happen?\n\n>> I'm still leaning towards NTA, he filmed you for his own benefit and there must be something wrong with his relationship if he needs to prove he didn't do anything.\n\nOP:\n> No", "> it leads right into \"and your boyfriend ... has been keeping it a secret behind your back just to laugh at me.\"\n\nIt would lead right into that *if that's what happened*.

I could be projecting based on my own experiences, though.", "Yeah, there're already people in the comments saying that OP should lie and accuse *him* of being the aggressor.", "Not necessarily.  I was being hit on by a co-workers SO once.  After I finally had enough and told her about it, turned out it was basically just the nail in the coffin.  She knew he was no good but she was operating on sunken cost fallacy.  She kicked him to the curb and she and I remained friends for years afterwards, until we both left the company.", " I reckon he has done worse and doesn't want your best friend to know which is probably something keeping your secret safe... but at what cost.", "I cannot see any reason why he would need that. There is no reason for him to have to watch it over and over in front of you. It was not ok for him to record you. That is not something a friend does.", "he could've watched it once before showing it to the gf, rather than tormenting op with the video and giving her time to decide she's had enough of his powertripping and escalating to stealing his phone and deleting the videos. if he really saw op as a creep why mock her by replaying the video over and over again IN HER PRESENCE.", "Why would he have to cover his tracks if it weren\u2019t for her trying to shower together, in case she drowns or some shit? Also to me implies the misso is already sus on her", "OP is the only narrator we have here.

Save your $20 and buy something better to do with your time.", "I'm sorry friend, that sucks. But in this situation his motives for MAKING the recording are irrelevant. What he DID with it was manipulative and hurtful.", "Forgive me if I don't take her at her full word.  She admits to lying on multiple occasions.  She admits she was so drunk she made this love confession.  I find it hard to believe she wasn't coming onto him.  Why would she all of a sudden start coming onto him AFTER he started recording?", "It is wild how many NTAs dominate the top as well", "But that would be blatantly lying", "The same narrator that later admitted she was trying to convince her friend to come take a shower with him. If genders were reversed, y'all would be ripping OP apart.", "She still hasn't come clean to her friend. She's trying to hide it. That is being a pretty bad friend.", "Because she was drunk? She doesn't say when she became aware that he was filming. And if you're just going to second guess everything because she's a liar, although we have no evidence that she lied to US in this post, then why stop there? She's a liar, after all. What are you even basing your judgment on if this is all lies? Or are you cherry-picking what you believe? Second guess her interpretation of things that she can't know, like intentions of other people or things that she wasn't there for, I get that. But assuming everything she says is a lie because she lied to her friend, then why not question that the post even happened while you're at it.", "Why would he even film people drunk, without consent. But im allergic to cameras. Id tell your friend to go through his phone.. She will most likely find videos of herself that she definately wouldnt have consented to. \n\nYour friend might think its funny you had a childhood crush on him and not be really mad.", "Until she sees that he\u2019s indeed an AH.

She admits she snuck into someone's phone.  She suggests he was doing it to protect himself.\n\nThose are all things she said.

Just imagine if he actually was here to give his side of the story.", "Hard agree, OP is shady af", "Not all lies are the same. \n\nLying about having feelings for someone because you don't want to stand in the way of your bff's romance? I wouldn't call that immoral or evidence someone frequently lies. \n\nDeleting a video that is being used to harass you and may ruin your relationship with your best friend? Definitely a lot murkier, but again, not enough for me to peg someone as a chronic liar. OP didn't go into his phone unmotivated, he was frequently playing the videos in front of her in public. \n\nI think the real question is: why was the guy taunting her with the video? If someone confesses their love to you--drunk or not--in what situation is it okay to mock that confession? Especially in public places where anyone can see? And why even keep the video at that point? \n\nIf OP was trying to make a move on him and the guy thought his gf needed to know, then he would have just told his gf what happened, not played games about it. \n\nEveryone is making the guy out to be the devil because what he was doing made no sense if his motivations were pure. \n\nI  understand a possible E S H vote since confessing to your friend's bf is wrong, but the guy was also clearly in the wrong.", "Exactly this.", "The BFF that is into her boyfriend, really?", "Except you are cherry-picking. How do you reconcile the fact that he was purposefully playing the video around other people they knew with your version of his character? How is that not holding the video over her head? How is that not being an AH? What if the others heard? Why isn't he coming clean to his GF already? If he was so worried about being in trouble or being falsely accused, it seems like something you share right away. Not in front of all your friends by playing the video. In private so your SO can process. \n\n\nAnd you are ok to believe her when she says he was filming to protect himself even though this is just speculations on her part and that she could have easily tipped the scales by simply saying \"I don't know why.\" Which would be true. But she chose to absolve him by providing an explanation that painted him in a good light. But she's misrepresenting the rest? \n\n\nYou are aware that 2 people can be assholes, right? It's an available judgment.", "And she isn\u2019t? Why aren\u2019t they both?", "You're twisting the words.  You say he was \"purposefully\" playing it near others, as if he was trying to make them hear it.  All she said was that it is possible they could have overheard it.  She provided no details about that situation.\n\nWhy isn't he coming clean to his GF?  Because she doesn't want him to?  So now he is a bad guy because he won't do what OP doesn't want him to do.\n\nShe was obviously hammered when this video incident happened.  That is why I put extra doubt (combined with her admitted lies) that she wasn't coming onto him.  She was drunk.  Drunk people don't remember everything  they do.\n\nShe was acting up, he started recording.\n\nThe only other explanation you all have suggested was that apparently he wanted to film her in the shower.  You pulled this out of thin air because you assume he is the bad guy."]}
