Thus, it does make you responsible in their eyes for his behavior.\n\nThat means, as long as you try to stay \"out of it\" and not pick a side; you're effectively sending a simple message to everyone. \"I don't care what you think.\"  That's both to your father, **and** your son.\n\nLike it or not, you MUST pick a side in this fight.  Your choices being take your father's side and agree that him wearing that to the wedding was inappropriate; or take your son's side and stand up for his decisions.\n\nFYI, this is a type of situation where you're \"Damned if you do, and damned if you don't.\"  There is no 'middle ground' here OP.", "YTA.

Your son is a child. Standing up for him seems like a parenting basic.", "Took me a while to think YTA. \n\nI was on the fence but the part that stood out was when your family first complained you said talk to my son about it.  You sent the fire to him instead of defending him. \n\nI would be ok if you saw them saying something and stood back to see how your son handled it and stepped in if needed. But you didn't you threw your hands up and said no my problem", "According to the age your listed, your child does deserve some backing.

First I say, good job on not making a big deal out of it. You just accepted the clothing choice which is admirable however.. he\u2019s 14. Yeah he\u2019s old enough to start making some of these decisions on his own but, it\u2019s nice to know that you still have one person on your corner.

Two scenarios here: either the kid decided to pull an outrageous stunt just for the fun and attention, or he quite sincerely feels like his best self in a dress. In the former case, it was your job to sit him down beforehand, explain that weddings are not the time/place, and he either wears something less attention-grabbing or he's not going. In the latter case you also sit down beforehand, gently make sure he's aware of the consequences, and work out a plan for dealing with them.\n\nIn short, you parent your kid. Skip the excuses and start doing so now.", "this is bad dad 101 YTA", "Reading between the lines, I think you disapprove of your kid's choices and instead of trying to understand him or having a conversation that you fear, you are throwing him to the wolves.

Clearly he wanted attention which is why he wore it to someone\u2019s wedding and I would consider talking to him about wedding etiquette and how you never do anything that may draw attention from the bride and groom and also how his decisions on what he wears will earn different opinions and he needs to be ready for that but you don\u2019t just let him sink or swim.  Now were the bride and groom upset over what he wore?  Because those are the only people who\u2019s opinion I would consider.", "YTA. \n\nYou should have had your son\u2019s back point blank. Yes your son can stand up for himself but some support and backup would have been nice. You really just let your family bully him all night? Yikes?", "YTA because of his age. \n14 is still too tender to deal with hate on your own. You seem too stand-off ish and not supportive enough imo. \nYou shouldn\u2019t have let anyone say anything to him and if you didn\u2019t want to deal with it YOU should\u2019ve killed the topic and said it wasn\u2019t up for discussion.", "Oh so you think if your son hears it from other relatives he\u2019ll stop? Have fun not having a son in a couple of years because you refuse accept and protect your son.", "YTA for not telling them off . While yes as a general thing your son needs to be able to stand up for himself you need to actually consider this specific situation the people complaining were older relatives and he's 14 there is a significant power imbalance and he couldn't win and I would be if he did stand up for himself he would have gotten in trouble for being disrespectful to his elders.", "YTA, 100%.\n\nYour son is 14 according to the comments. He still needs your support. It would be one thing if he was an adult child, but he still needs your protection and he needs to know you have his back. Your family had nothing kind to say to him (they were assholes here too) and you knew it and you basically encouraged them to harrass him.\n\nYou knew they\u2019d say cruel or hurtful things to him and your lack of action or willingness to stick up for him reads as if you don\u2019t like that he wore the dress but were too afraid to actually say it aloud, so you let him be humiliated. The choice to throw up your hands and say its not up to you indicates that you want him to be piled up on. I think you had a sense this would happen and you either thought this would \u201cbuild character\u201d or get your family off your back temporarily. But you effectively threw him under the bus.\n\nYou\u2019re right it is your son\u2019s choice to dress how he chooses, and this CAN have social consequences. But as Desmond Tutu once said, \u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\u201d By pretending you have no opinion or agency, you actually just made your son even more vulnerable to your family\u2019s ire when he is clearly exploring his own relationship to gender and presentation.\n\nYou may want to reflect on why it is you felt your son should just be on his own during this family event. Do you feel threatened by his choice? Did you hope he\u2019d be embarrassed by family members and then never do it again and you wouldn\u2019t have to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d telling him no? \n\nAny which way, your son needs support at every age. Self-reflection can help you figure out what\u2019s keeping you from doing that.", "YTA. If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice, and your neutrality does your minor son no favors.", "YTA for not standing up for your son. At 14, he shouldn't have to take the lead on defending himself from bigoted comments from your family about what boys should wear. You threw him under the bus and you owe him an apology.

Why are you letting grown adults give him a hard time about, of all things, a piece of clothing? Why doesn't it concern you what might've been said to your child? How your child might be processing all of this? It's not for me to say whether or not he should've worn a dress to begin with. Personally, I don't see the problem. But even if he was in fact doing it \"for attention,\" you're just going to let a bunch of adults shit on your 14 year old kid? Sure, he should be old enough to stand on his own to a certain extent.

I have never seen it play out that way.", "You're being downvoted because the answer makes you look worse. You not helping protect your kid from an overbearing family is already pushing you deep into AH territory. But you not helping protect a kid who is barely high school age, and still too young to get a job or even a learner's permit, makes it just that much worse. Kids at that age are just finding themselves. Just learning who they are. And they do that best with the gentle support of those closest to them. You tried the \"throw them in at the deep end and hope they swim\" method instead. The only thing you've managed to teach your kid is that you can't be trusted or relied upon when needed.\n\nEdit: I went in you hard because your behavior, this compulsive need not to pick a side between your family's bigotry and your kid's genuine desire to just be happy, is truly awful. It is that deep, even if you don't see it. But I want to give you some genuine advice here. This fence sitting is picking a side. By not helping your kid stand up for their own happiness, you're choosing to let your family continue to bully them over a piece of fabric. You have the power to shut them down. To speak with the authority your kid's status as a minor prevents them from carrying. You can make this stop, one way or another. Every second you choose to do nothing is an active choice to continue your child's bullying, whether you realize it or not. Take a stand. Fight for your kid's happiness.

The problem is that you failed to consider the people whose event it was, and you let your son act out in a way you knew would be interpreted as disrespectful. Then, when the bigots acted like bigots (predictably), you denied responsibility and set your son up to face the flak alone.\n\nYou might think your son is an adult, but he's not. He doesn't have your skills of consequence prediction. He's 14. Rather than allow him to create a poo-storm that affected the experiences of everyone present, it was your job to prevent the poo-storm by making sure your son had appropriate attire for this event, and to encourage him to explore his unique personal style in a venue where the stakes are lower.\n\nI understand cause and effect parenting, because I had a kid who only learned from FAFO and who won her share of stupid prizes.

Now that the wedding has finished, there's no onus on the OP to keep things civil. She should be standing up for her son's beliefs against her own father, but she's opting to ride the fence.\n\nI suspect, personally, she's doing this to simply avoid confrontation.  Problem is continuing to ride the fence is sending a message to her son that she agrees with his grandfather's statements, regardless of if she lets him wear the things he wants to; as she's not expressly taking up for him.", "Okay, I think I understand what you're saying.

He's taken a stand. He does not care what his son wears. He's said it many times, here and to family he's explained. It sounds like this is a topic OP has to discuss often with his family and instead of giving them the drama they seek he's telling them not to even bother and advising his son to do the same (ignore it, walk away etc). \n\nOPs family is so desperate for something to create drama they chose an article of clothing his 14 year old son wore.

If he wants to wear a dress to an event where not everyone will be so open minded, he has to understand that the dress is a statement.
