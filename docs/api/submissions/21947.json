Her parents are mentally abusive & just very hard to live with in general, so i completely understand her situation. \n\nA few weeks ago signed a contract for my first apartment, so Anna suggested that she could just move in with me, since she can\u2019t afford to rent a place on her own. I told her that I don\u2019t really feel comfortable doing that, since the apartment is REALLY small (it\u2019s basically 1 room + a bathroom). She likes the idea of us never being separated & always being together, but I really don\u2019t want that. I truly love her, but I need alone time, where I can just lock myself in my room, isolated from society basically. That wouldn\u2019t be possible in this apartment. I explained all of this to her, but she got really mad about it, telling me that I\u2019m selfish for not helping her out of her family situation. \nI explained that I didn\u2019t want her to feel trapped in her parents home, but since we\u2019re both 18 & haven\u2019t been dating for that long, I feel very unsure about all this & it\u2019s just too fast for me. Anna then told me to not call or text her until I understand why I\u2019m selfish & left.

I understand her situation is bad, but 11 months may be a little fast to move in and you aren't comfortable. There are other places to stay for her. You can shelter her some nights, but this may be a little fast and you will be stuck if she does.", "NTA Honestly she is TA for saying that you have to help her get out of her parents house.", "You are not the A**hole. Living together should be something that you both want to do together. Do not let her emotionally manipulate you into doing something that you do not want. Your reasons and feelings are valid and she should understand as well. For her to tell you that you are selfish for not wanting her to move in is actually also selfish on her part because she's not taking into consideration your actual feelings. She honestly never even asked you if it was okay she just assumed that she can and she doesn't have the right to do that.", "You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\nYou know what you want and what you need and you\u2019ve communicated that clearly to Anna. \n\nShe\u2019s railing against your boundary (red flag 1)\n\nAttempting to move relationship along quickly (red flag 2)\n\nDevaluating you by calling you selfish. (Red flag 3)\n\nAnd is now stonewalling you. (Red flag 4)\n\nHer actions have been designed to pressurise, devalue, cause pain and confusion. \n\nThese are not the actions of someone who loves you. These are abusive traits. \n\nBe careful about what you do next OP. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nSpeaking from experience, don't move in together. \n\nShe probably shouldn't even spend any nights there either tbh. She will ignore you for a few more plays, then oh woe is me, do you still love me? Well show me you do and let me stay here for a while ( no definite timeline). \n\nNope. Run the opposite direction. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA your reason is valid. she\u2019s just pushing for it because she doesn\u2019t like her home life", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t ready, do not let her force you into cohabitation. If not giving in means you break up that is for the best. Do not let her force her way into your home.\n\nIf you can support yourself and get your own place she can do the same for herself.", "NTA. She's the one acting selfishly, expecting you to cater to her. \n\nHonestly I got a wave of awful claustrophobia when you wrote she \"likes the idea of us never being separated & always being together.\" Shudder. She needs to learn how to be her own person and stand on her own two feet, not how to glom onto someone she thinks will be better to live with than her parents.", "NTA .  It's not fair for her to label you as selfish for wanting to maintain your own comfort and sanity.", "Seems she's looking for something you aren't willing to supply. I suggest moving on because she's already looking for the person that will rescue her from her situation. If she was the one for you the decision would be easy. So, back to the dating pool. You only want the perks and really aren't looking for more anyway.", "NTA\n\nSo she wants to is trying to manipulate you so she can get away from her abusive parents? \n\nYou are both young, and in any case moving in together should be a mutual decision, not a thing that is forced upon you.", "You are definitely NTA. You are valid to feel this way and want your own space. Just because you don\u2019t want her to move in with you doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t sympathetic to her situation. If you are not ready to take a huge step like moving in together, then you\u2019re not ready. That doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t love her. \n\nYou should sit down with her and very bluntly express your feelings on the situation and how it\u2019s making you feel. Don\u2019t be afraid to express your emotions with her, things will only get worse for you if you do something you don\u2019t want to in the end for the sake of being nice. Maybe you two can come to a compromise where you help her look for an apartment with a friend or find a different living situation but I highly suggest you stick to your boundaries, only you know what you\u2019re okay with and what you\u2019re not okay with. You are not selfish for wanting your own personal space, it is completely valid.\n\nGood luck friend and I hope everything goes well!", "NTA. Sonds like she's learned a thing or two from her emotionally abusive parents. Run OP,  \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. If you\u2019re not comfortable with it, don\u2019t do it.", "NTA.  You are 18, have been dating only 11 months, and she has already let you know she is planning on being joined at the hip, which is something you don't want. \nShe has shown her total immaturity by giving you the silent treatment.  That in itself is a huge red flag. How can you have a relationship based on trust, love, and wanting the best for the other when one person thinks giving the silent treatment is a legitimate way to get power-over in decision making situations?\nThis is a great time to break up and find someone more mature and much less needy and manipulative. Enjoy your apartment.", "NTA.  \nIt seems she just wants to use you to leave her parents..\n\nIt is your life and your place, she can't just decide to stay even if it make you feel uncomfortable (and even more if she can't afford a rent).", "NTA. Imagine this, after only dating for less than a year, she already feel entitled that she should be allowed to move in. Think of all the things she feels she is entitled to after moving in. You dodge a bullet man,  move on.", "Nta, don't do this, she is using you.", "NTA and you should keeo an eye open in this relationship. \n\nTrying to guilttrip your partner to ignore their boundaries and get what you want is manipulation. I see how she has the need to get away from her parents, but its ironic she wants to get away from her mentally abusiv parents and uses an abusiv tactic herself - this is understandable since thats what she knows from home, but for you, as her partner, your alarms should go off. \n\nI don't think she is ready to live with a partner till she worked through her trauma. If she doesn't do this, she will repeat the cycle of abuse with her partner and her future kids.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
