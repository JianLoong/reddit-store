You know the shitty one, who we all have are fingers crossed hoping that the bio kid/s go NC with and the rest of the family is so disgusted by the crappy treatment that they go NC with you also and instead give the bio kid all the love and support they lacked do to being unfortunate enough to have such a crap human as a parent.", "Why do you think they\u2019re favouring the kid they spent less money on?", "You just answered your own AITA you big ninny.", "If they wanted quantity of quality then they should have specified so your parents could have bought a lot more of the cheaper options instead of Tiffany studs and airpods maxes.\n\nThey can always return them to their grandparents if it's too little.", "Those are some pricy gifts to even put on a wish list, let alone complain after receiving them.  My mother would have snatched the earrings and airpods off of my head if I was so ungrateful.", "If they gave the keys to a new car, that\u2019s just one item isn\u2019t it?\n\nI really can\u2019t comprehend this thinking- it boggles the mind that you\u2019d think 10 books outweigh AirPods Max.", "Yta\nHow old are you? \u201cMoney wise it\u2019s more than Jane but it\u2019s only one item from their list\u201d this is such a ridiculous statement \n\nAlso\u2026 Your kids put Tiffany jewelry and airpod maxes on their wish list? And got them but mad they didn\u2019t get more? Those kids are AH too", "You know you are an actual idiot, right? I hope you\u2019re not planning on having anymore, it would be a shame to pass on your intellect.", "Lmao what other things did they put on the list? Electric guitars, a car, some jimmy choos, a Tiara? Seriously? Jane\u2019s gifts were way cheaper.", "Seriously!? They had more spent on them then Jane and you\u2019re upset? That wasn\u2019t unfair at all", "Sounds like you love your husband's kids more than your daughter \ud83d\ude43 if anything, you should be upset that your parents gifted their own grandchild cheaper gifts. YTA. Your husband too for agreeing with you. But of course, his kids ain't it \ud83c\udf1d", "Yta. Jane got everything on her list because the items on her list were all relatively cheap (especially compared to the gifts gotten for her siblings). Monetarily the gifts are \u201cequal\u201d. They\u2019re not actually but sounds like your parents were trying to get Jane enough to \u201cmatch\u201d the gifts they chose for your other two children", "You sound like Dudley in the first Harry Potter movie, except he was eleven.", "I understood at ten years old that my grandparents spent the same amount on my digital camera that they spent on my 5yo brother's various toys, even though visually he seemed to get \"more\" than me. Your teenagers are perfectly capable of grasping this concept as well, and frankly need to. They asked for very expensive things.", "Lecture in Engineering here, I feel your dismay", "To be fair, OP could've been a theater kid. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Haha came here to say this!", "Lol. My partner says that all the time", "OP said it was a replica Messi shirt so that could have been $9-$50 depending who made it.", "Nonono! See, it\u2019s not like that, it\u2019s different! It only works one way!\n\nYTA", "The clarification makes it even worst. I thought it\u2019s common (logic) to equalize gifts by ensuring they\u2019re parity in costs. Not\u2026 in quantity. Would OP still think her bio daughter got more if she was given 50 cans of beans while her stepchildren got Tiffany earrings and Airpod Maxes? Lol. It seems like there is a thread of favouritism and it\u2019s towards the husband\u2019s children instead of her own. How sad.", "> If they're all brand new hardbacks or special editions, then yeah. \n\nEven then\u2026\n\nI just checked (again, because I keep wanting to pull the trigger and chickening out), the Collector\u2019s Library edition from Discworld Emporium is \u00a315 a piece. It ends up rather dear because there\u2019s 41 volumes if you buy the entire set.", "Even theatre kids know better! Signed, former theatre student.", "Yeah $25 is a lot unless those are technical books. Even nice hardbacks will generally retail for less than 20.", " those were items on their list. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s favouritism I think the two kids were asking for ALOT and those were two of the choices. They sound entitled AF.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine putting $700 items on my xmas list to my parents let alone grandparents", "Unless it's an antique book then no the average book most teenage girls are asking for isn't more than $30 even if as a hardback.", "That's what I was thinking as well. If she got 50 items from dollar store, means she got more gifts than them? What kind of kids get Tiffany's & airpod compare the gifts with books & jersey which obviously lesser monetary value & get upsets? \n\nI'm just being petty here, Jane should be the one be upset on why didn't her grandparents pick something else on their wishlist to make their gifts have somewhat equal values", "The pair of studs they got were $840. The AirPods Max are $549.\n\nYeah, Jane should be the one 'complaining'. Seems like she's far more grounded than her mom though. Good for her.", "Yes, we do know better, most of us anyways. Signed, another former theatre student.", "Boom! This right here!  You took the words right out of my mouth. I feel sorry for Jane. I can\u2019t imagine what she might possibly have to deal with day time day with her mother and adopted siblings.", "this made me laugh aloud, thank you", "$6900 for a crib?!?!", "If I added the square frame to my old crib. Then it would be very similar. And that cot was second hand.", "Are the last few pictures supposed to be the toddler bed? With the sharp pointy things at the top?! This seems like a terrible design, unless I'm missing something.", "Teen and YA books are up to $20 even as hardbacks", "At that point it'd probably be cheaper in the long run to take woodworking and eventually build it yourself", "And it's so ugly too", "I like that its best feature (IMO) is it converts into a bigger bed for a toddler, but you have to remove the 24k gold plated square to do so.\n\nFuck yeah second hand, especially with baby stuff.", "> so each book would need to be $59 to even match the cost of the earrings.\n\nTechnically possible but unlikely: this would be the price for large hardcovers which are either low-print or complex (e.g. lots of color / photo pages).\n\nOr textbooks I guess, that scam\u2019s expensive.", "Depending on where they got the shirt from, it would be even less. Nike shirts are about 150 (actual jersey material) and then they just have to find someone to do customise. Or if they get it from the club, it\u2019s only a few bucks more. They could have also gotten a knockoff and it would be less than 100", "Too true. I have a few art books that also cost me a pretty penny and didn't think of those. Sometimes collectable books too. But from what people have mentioned about OP's prices, definitely cheaper than the individual gifts for the other kids. \n\nQuality > Quantity."]}
