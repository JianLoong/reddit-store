Not saying they're a bad idea though.", "Sorry. Typo on the math.", "This person is up and down this thread claiming books are some kind of bank-breaking luxury good, and it's genuinely so baffling to me. Why choose that nonsense hill to die on?", "Please help, Where are you buying from?\n\nI can\u2019t find any good books for under 15-20 Canadian, I need help baaad.", "That\u2019s fine, I didn\u2019t even catch it the first time I read your comment!", "Like I said,\n\n> I don't doubt that you got books on the cheap, but it's also not that easy\n\nAnd doing a quick Google search will tell you the average paperback is $14-18.", "Anything with a lot of color print pictures (fashion books, art books, sometimes cookbooks) can be expensive too. But I'm willing to bet that Jane just asked for novels.\n\nAnd like, even if she did ask for pricier types of books... If you up the cost of each book to $40, that's $400. A lot to spend on a Christmas present, but still less than the cost of the other gifts.", "Seriously, by the time I was 10 I definitely understood that different items had different costs. I knew that for Christmas and birthday I could only expect to get one \"big\" gift, and multiple smaller gifts.\n\nI bet you ten bucks that the stepkids filled their lists with expensive items and the grandparents thought it would be too unreasonable to get more than one for each.", "I guess that depends on where you live. I live in the Netherlands, and especially fiction paperbacks can go for as low as $7", "I live in a sizeable (200K) Midwest city in the US. \n\nYou can get some books below $10 at Barnes & Noble, but it's usually not the case for most fiction & nonfiction paperbacks. Ive been reading the Expanse & it's about $16-18 at B&N. Paid similarly for other sci-fi, fantasy, and other nonfiction books. \n\nI usually pay a similar price at local book stores to what I pay at B&N. Amazon is about the cheapest there is for me outside of used book stores, but the last I checked there isn't one in my city.", "This is very odd- what a strange morning on here."]}
