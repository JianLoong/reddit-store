There are many cultures where kids start drinking coffee early in life. Treating coffee like alcohol is ridiculous when you consider how much caffeine is in your standard k-cup vs a Monster energy drink, which is potentially more hazardous than cheap coffee and more popular among teens.\n\nAlso, when I was in high school (this was like 2007-2011), I had to get up at 6am because school started at 7am. I desperately needed caffeine at that age to stay awake throughout the day and resorted to...Vault (sold in our vending machines, RIP to Coke's short lived version of Mountain Dew) or Monster (I'd have to walk to the grocery store before school) and eventually cigarettes (sneaking around at ass o'clock in the morning for a smoke).\n\nI'd say it's better to let the 16 year old just drink the coffee rather than implement draconian rules based off nothing but a feeling.

The reason people feel so bland before their coffee in the morning? Only a fraction of that is from being tired.
