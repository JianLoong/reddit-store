My husband, sister and sister's husband and I went on a cruise together with our kids. As you may know, food is typically included on cruise fare. What you eat on the boat is free. What you eat in port isn't.\n\nAnyway, my sister saw a local restaurant and really wanted to try the local cuisine. I thought that was a waste of money, but I understand why she wanted to go, because it's the cuisine of a foreign country she might never return to. I said I would take my kids to a nearby attraction while they ate, and they could meet me there afterwards, because I wasn't hungry. My sister's kids also wanted to go to the local attraction, as opposed to a restaurant. I thought this was a good idea, because it would allow the other adults to enjoy their meal more, so I said I would take them as well.\n\nMy sister's husband said he felt weird about me having all four kids alone while in a foreign country, so he would also go with me. My sister said \"just forget it\" after he said that. I told her to enjoy the restaurant, there would be no rush, and we would just chill at the local attraction. She said she didn't want to eat out alone. My husband said he would eat with her, but she just glared at him.\n\nThe little tiff blew over for the most part, but we did end up arguing about it on the last day on the boat, where she said it was pretty petty and childish for me to ruin her chance to enjoy the restaurant she'd probably never have a chance to eat at again. I told her no one ruined her chance and she could have gone. She said obviously she wouldn't want to experience it with just my husband. I asked what she wanted me to have done, and she said if I was just going to be an asshole about it we wouldn't talk about it.

You offered quite generously to do something else and take her kids of her hands so she and her hubby can enjoy the local cuisine. If anything, I would think she should be annoyed with her husband.

You didn't do *dick*.", "NTA, if she just wanted to try the cuisine, it shouldn't matter who was or wasn't with her. I know some people are uncomfortable dining alone, but her brother in law was interested in eating there, so problem solved. If she wanted the whole family to be there, she should have said so instead of being passive aggressive. She ruined her chance, not you.", "Nta. She is mad at her husband", "NTA. Your solution was perfectly reasonable. Your sister and her husband were the ones that ruined it.", "INFO: Was your husband on board with eating at the restaurant? How old in general are the kids (toddlers or older?).", "NTA.  Her husband screwed this up, not you.  Tell her to be mad at him.", "Info: I'm confused.

Your sister ruined her own chance to eat at that restaurant & wants to blame you. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nHer husband kinda was, you weren't alone you had your husband, so that was kind of a lame excuse imo. You weren't hungry and your kids wanted to go see the attraction. No reason for you and the kids to sit miserably rather than enjoy the attraction. \n\nIn reality you could reverse her own argument. Why should you waste the opportunity to see the attraction that you might never get to see again?", "NTA while it would have gone smoother if your husband volunteered to go with the kids instead of her husband volunteering, but that's not on you.\n\nI love trying new foods so I get where your sister was coming from, but her prolonged reaction is excessive. On a group holiday but everyone is going to want to do the same thing and that's okay. Sister is acting like only her choices should matter. \n\nIn the end she was the one who chose not to go, when she still had the option to. She seems to have some obvious dislike of your husband though, all things considered including the glare. She had the chance to go to a restaurant she clearly wanted to go to, but apparently a couple of hours in your husband's company was too much of a price.", "NTA  \n\n\nshe was the one that decided not to go you were trying to find something else to do while she was in there.  \n\n\nmabey she wanted everyone to try it out?", "NTA, it was nice of you to offer to take the kids and it was nice of your husband to offer to come with her when she brought up the issue of not wanting to go alone. She ruined it for herself and she can honestly stop complaining about it. She's an adult who was offered free babysitting for her to enjoy something she wanted to do, she's a huge AH for complaining about that.", "NTA. If anyone \"ruined\" it for her it was her husband. She's choosing to blame you instead.", "NTA.\n\nI think she and her husband should have just done dinner with their kids, while you left to do the excursion with yours.

If she/they didn\u2019t exercise their own parental decision-making role and then felt pressured by their kids wanting to go with you\u2026 that\u2019s just weak parenting. In a foreign country, they should probably watch their own kids and surely they could have just said \u2018nope, kids, you\u2019re staying with us.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, there was no need for you and your kids to be kept hostage to their dinner plans, so I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by wanting to go do something else.", "NTA her husband screwed this up royally for no other reason than some good old fashioned xenophobia. She should be berating him not you.", "NTA.  You actually were really nice to offer to take the kids and everything.  If anyone was at fault it was her husband for backing out.  Sounds like he was using you as an excuse to not go.  Or was he looking to spend some time with you?", "YTA-  soon as the BIL said he would go too, you should have just said you'd stay too.
