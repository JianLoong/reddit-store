It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but her own. Eat alone, eat with op Spouse, take food to go, or don\u2019t. That\u2019s her choice. You shouldn\u2019t blame other for your own choices. Regardless of your reasons. \n\nAnd I get SIL\u2019s feelings. I don\u2019t like to eat out alone or go to theatres alone but guess what it\u2019s normal if you do. It\u2019s a mental thing.

I'm saying it's bound to be less stressful with 2 adults minding 4 kids in an unfamilar area than just the 1.\n\nAnd I truthfully do not get why people think the BIL *shouldn't* have offered to help. Is potentially offending OP's parenting capabilities enough reason to be expected to leave her to it?

It was only OP that offered to take the kids somewhere.\n\nBIL felt bad that she'd have all four by herself.\n\nThe glare SIL gave OP's husband when he said he would eat was either through dislike or because SIL chose to feel hard done by/was trying to guilt her husband into staying.", "They surely accept dollars, if you shout loud enough though", "Then it'll take you a bit longer."]}
