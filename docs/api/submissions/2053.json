He passed away when I was 15. \n\nAs the house was quite big (7be/4ba), my parents talked to me about our family moving there, as it would be cheaper and accommodate everyone.

I don't pay the house bills, but I help with the groceries. \n\nThis month I started having complaints from my parents saying that I should help more with my younger brothers (I always argue that I'm not their father and that it's their responsibility). As they are so financially tight and started to charge me to pay some bills, because they were not able to and I started to pay some, but not as they wanted. \n\nI had my limit when they suggested I move into their room as they would need space for the new baby and they pay most of the bills so they should have the biggest room. \n\nI told them they can pay most bills, but they don't pay a dime on a huge house and it's only in my name. And if they want more space for their ninth child, I suggest they move to another house, because I am the owner of the house and I won't give up my comfort because they don't stop having children. \n\nThey started calling me an ungrateful son and that they raised me to be empathetic and kind, but I am showing myself to be a cold and extremely selfish person who threatens their own parents to take them out of the house for not agreeing with a suggestion.\n\n I talked to my maternal grandmother, she said that she understands my side, but that I may have been very hard on them, especially since they were my parents. They're not talking to me properly btw. \n\nAITA?\n\nNot US\n\n\nObviously I'm not able to support the house on my own, but it's a great house for rent and only with it I could rent a smaller house and live on that money alone.

(when I was growing up I had a friend who was 14, like me, and was 'in charge' of the 4 kids under her ages 3 - 11 - I thought that was crazy !)\n\nSecondly, its YOUR house. They should appreciate your kindness in allowing them ALL to live there RENT FREE.\n\nThirdly, if they want the Master bedroom, then they can rent a house and have the Master bedroom. The stipulation for them moving in was that you get the Master Bedroom. And they agreed to that.\n\nLastly The only bills you should be paying are those pertaining only to you. You should not have to pay for any shared bills, since what you use in utilities is a miniscule amount in comparison to what the rest of the family uses, for which your parents are responsible.\n\nWhether they are/were your parents or not, it is still your house and they agreed to the stipulations when they moved in.

You're 23; live your life and do you.  \n\nI definitely have objections to them asking you for money AT ALL, considering they're making up 90% of every charge there and not paying rent.

In future you can certainly \"not agree to a suggestion\" without \"threatening to take them out of the house.\"", "NTA - you didn\u2019t choose to have nine children, your parents did, therefore the responsibility falls on them to care for their own children. As for the bills, it\u2019s normal that they should pay more as they and their children are utilizing most of the house, most of the groceries etc. If money is tight then they should stop having children and living beyond their means.", "NTA\u2026 9 kids sounds like a personal hell", "NTA\n\nNo one should have that many kids, particularly if one cannot afford or cannot properly take care of them.

Assuming you own the property outright, these are still huge expenses. Can you afford them if they move out? \n\nI don't think it is fair of them to expect you to babysit your siblings but if they are paying the bills on the property, asking for the larger room does not feel out of line. \n\nIt sounds to me like you just need a more formal rental agreement.", "Info: who payed taxes? Who pays upkeep if something breaks? Who pays mortgage? Just trying to sort out who is spending the most money on the house. It wasn\u2019t clear from your post.", "**ESH**\n\nI'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, I'm sure, as this sub tends heavily towards, \"It's your house so you make the rules\". And you're trying really hard to make it seem just that simple: that you're being really magnanimous by letting them live there (and you are, to a large extent) and they're doing nothing to deserve it (which is where it gets tricky). But *would you even have been able to keep your paternal family home, such a big house with all its property taxes, upkeep, etc., if your parents weren't there paying ALL of the bills?* If you ask them to leave, will you be able to keep it, or will you have to sell it? You say that you're 23 with a \"good salary\" but I know very few 23-year-olds who could afford to keep a 7-bedroom/4-bathroom house. \n\nYour parents are AHs because they ARE taking advantage, and it seems that they've gotten so used to the status quo that they've forgotten just how lucky they are to have a rent-free, mortgage-free home as a family of 10 that's about to grow again. They'd be hard-pressed to find a home that would reasonably fit a family that size even if they WERE paying rent/mortgage. They should be engaging with you with less of a sense of entitlement, for sure.\n\nThat said . . . they weren't completely wrong, or even AHs, to ASK about the master bedroom. You have every right to turn them down of course, but they're not wrong that it's not just about ownership; having a bit of extra space and an ensuite bathroom (I assume) can make a HUGE difference in the care of a baby in the first year or so. They may have been trying to be genuinely practical. I'm not commenting on their \"still having more babies\" because it's not my business. People's reproductive choices are not my business. \n\nAll told, though, you're also a bit of an AH because you are diminishing the HUGE impact of having someone living in your house who pays ALL of the bills and only expects you to contribute towards groceries. I'm not sure that even you realise how drastically your life will change if you suddenly become responsible for all of that. What they are doing for you financially is not negligible. \n\nRight now it seems like there's a lot of resentment building and ESH.
