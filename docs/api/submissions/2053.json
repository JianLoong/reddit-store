He passed away when I was 15. \n\nAs the house was quite big (7be/4ba), my parents talked to me about our family moving there, as it would be cheaper and accommodate everyone. The only thing I wanted was the master suite for myself and it actually became my bedroom. \n\nCurrently, my mother is 6 months pregnant again.\n\n I work and earn a good salary. I don't pay the house bills, but I help with the groceries. \n\nThis month I started having complaints from my parents saying that I should help more with my younger brothers (I always argue that I'm not their father and that it's their responsibility). As they are so financially tight and started to charge me to pay some bills, because they were not able to and I started to pay some, but not as they wanted. \n\nI had my limit when they suggested I move into their room as they would need space for the new baby and they pay most of the bills so they should have the biggest room. \n\nI told them they can pay most bills, but they don't pay a dime on a huge house and it's only in my name. And if they want more space for their ninth child, I suggest they move to another house, because I am the owner of the house and I won't give up my comfort because they don't stop having children. \n\nThey started calling me an ungrateful son and that they raised me to be empathetic and kind, but I am showing myself to be a cold and extremely selfish person who threatens their own parents to take them out of the house for not agreeing with a suggestion.\n\n I talked to my maternal grandmother, she said that she understands my side, but that I may have been very hard on them, especially since they were my parents. They're not talking to me properly btw. \n\nAITA?\n\nNot US\n\n\nObviously I'm not able to support the house on my own, but it's a great house for rent and only with it I could rent a smaller house and live on that money alone. The fees that are yearly here, my grandfather left a responsible accountant to pay that for me with some money left for this, so no, they don't put money in the house besides bills and any things that break.

Their baby, their problem.  I do think it's good for you to pay your share of groceries and utilities. Beyond that, nope. \n\nAnd you know it will just get worse. Soon they'll be bothering you for money to feed, clothe, and educate their kids. Put your foot down. You're already generously letting them stay rent free. If they don't like the situation, they can leave. So, no, you aren't an A. Not at all.", "NTA - if your parents can't afford to house and feed their 9 children on their own, then they should stop having kids. Their demands are also presumptuous -- they will soon take over the house and what about if you want to get married and have kids of your own? I would sit down with them and establish a timeline of how they intend to manage their lives independent of you and make it clear that you will not be financially responsible for them, nor will you parent your siblings or give up your bedroom.", "NTA. That's the time when \"My house, my rules\" plays out in the child's favor. And you are right, if they don't pay anything for housing and still struggle with bills, maybe they should actually rethink having more children.", "NTA.  They don't get to expect freebies out of other because they refused to stop having kids.  They choose to have kids, they can move out and pay for all of them.", "nta, yeah you were a bit harsh but it's understandable why. you let them live in a big house for basically nothing, they can't expect freebies\n\nedit: just saw the 8 kids part why are they having kids if they don't have enough room and money", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, they are THEIR children, not yours so you have NO obligation to parent them. (when I was growing up I had a friend who was 14, like me, and was 'in charge' of the 4 kids under her ages 3 - 11 - I thought that was crazy !)\n\nSecondly, its YOUR house. They should appreciate your kindness in allowing them ALL to live there RENT FREE.\n\nThirdly, if they want the Master bedroom, then they can rent a house and have the Master bedroom. The stipulation for them moving in was that you get the Master Bedroom. And they agreed to that.\n\nLastly The only bills you should be paying are those pertaining only to you. You should not have to pay for any shared bills, since what you use in utilities is a miniscule amount in comparison to what the rest of the family uses, for which your parents are responsible.\n\nWhether they are/were your parents or not, it is still your house and they agreed to the stipulations when they moved in. If they no longer agree to them, they are welcome to move elsewhere. Thats not you being hard on them, thats you setting boundries so as to not be trampled.", "NTA. This house is yours. Your mom is extremely lucky she can live in such a big house without having to pay rent. Asking for more is totally delusional of her.", "NTA. And you have all the power here. Stick to your guns. No babysitting. No paying their bills. They should move.", "NTA.  It looks like your parents are starting to see themselves as entitled to your house and if you don't establish needed boundaries they will escalate.  To be blunt, your parents need to understand and appreciate their place in *your* house, before it gets out of hand.", "NTA\n\nIt's sadly common for people to take all the space you give them and ask for more. You were right to remind them of the situation they are in. You have NO obligation to house them forever. At some point you might want to have a partner live with you. What do they expect to happen then?", "NTA.  \n\nIt's more than fair that they get to stay there rent free in exchange for paying bills.  You said your only real line was that you get the master and don't have to parent the kids, which is reasonable--it's your fucking house and they're not your kids.  You're 23; live your life and do you.  \n\nI definitely have objections to them asking you for money AT ALL, considering they're making up 90% of every charge there and not paying rent.  They're trying to squeeze you; hold your line and don't let them.", "They live in your house rent free and keep popping out kids they can't afford, and they call you selfish? Pfft. NTA by a long shot.", "You're NTA. Maybe of they would slow down the baby factory, money wouldn't be so tight. They're the ones who sound ungrateful. They're saving a bundle on what a house that size would cost them.", "NTA. They are being entitled. You can always get some tenants to pay rent on the various rooms in your house.", "NTA... I can't stand family members that take advantage of situations. You have been kind and allowed them to live in your house rent free. It blows my mind that your mom is pregnant with a ninth child.", "NTA fuckem. If you can't support 9 kids don't fucking have 9 kids.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your house that you are allowing them to live in with a whole gaggle of kids, to which they are adding another.\n\nTheir kids are not your responsibility but mom is trying to guilt you into taking on some of that responsibility.  It would probably be best for all if your mom and her tribe move to different accommodations.  I'm sure it is nice to have your siblings nearby but with everyone in your house, it is causing problems.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your house and you should be able to keep the largest bedroom, and to have at least some privacy from this menagerie your mother has created. If they are not satisfied with the accommodations, they are of course free to find other lodgings.\n\nWhatever happened to being grateful that they moved to a larger house and pay much less for it than before you inherited the property?  Perhaps if they were still in their previous, more expensive and smaller home, they would have been more careful not to have another baby.\n\nThis disagreement was ALWAYS going to happen at some point.  They will continue to ask you to do more, to pay more, and to give up space until you make a firm stand.  In future you can certainly \"not agree to a suggestion\" without \"threatening to take them out of the house.\"", "NTA - you didn\u2019t choose to have nine children, your parents did, therefore the responsibility falls on them to care for their own children. As for the bills, it\u2019s normal that they should pay more as they and their children are utilizing most of the house, most of the groceries etc. If money is tight then they should stop having children and living beyond their means.", "NTA\u2026 9 kids sounds like a personal hell", "NTA\n\nNo one should have that many kids, particularly if one cannot afford or cannot properly take care of them. That should never be the person's job who didn't choose to have them. Interesting that they're talking about empathy when they seem to be lacking in that department themselves.", "NTA. Not one bit", "NTA. They should have made plans for when and how they would move out of your house. They should have been putting those plans into place since they moved in. As it is they're just hoping to mooch of their son for how long? The rest of their lives?", "NTA your mother is being irresponsible to bring yet another child into the world when she and your stepfather cannot support them. It's harsh but kick them out because it's only going to get worse. It's your house not theirs and they need to respect that.", "INFO: does bills include property taxes and homeowners insurance? Assuming you own the property outright, these are still huge expenses. Can you afford them if they move out? \n\nI don't think it is fair of them to expect you to babysit your siblings but if they are paying the bills on the property, asking for the larger room does not feel out of line. \n\nIt sounds to me like you just need a more formal rental agreement.", "Info: who payed taxes? Who pays upkeep if something breaks? Who pays mortgage? Just trying to sort out who is spending the most money on the house. It wasn\u2019t clear from your post.", "**ESH**\n\nI'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, I'm sure, as this sub tends heavily towards, \"It's your house so you make the rules\". And you're trying really hard to make it seem just that simple: that you're being really magnanimous by letting them live there (and you are, to a large extent) and they're doing nothing to deserve it (which is where it gets tricky). But *would you even have been able to keep your paternal family home, such a big house with all its property taxes, upkeep, etc., if your parents weren't there paying ALL of the bills?* If you ask them to leave, will you be able to keep it, or will you have to sell it? You say that you're 23 with a \"good salary\" but I know very few 23-year-olds who could afford to keep a 7-bedroom/4-bathroom house. \n\nYour parents are AHs because they ARE taking advantage, and it seems that they've gotten so used to the status quo that they've forgotten just how lucky they are to have a rent-free, mortgage-free home as a family of 10 that's about to grow again. They'd be hard-pressed to find a home that would reasonably fit a family that size even if they WERE paying rent/mortgage. They should be engaging with you with less of a sense of entitlement, for sure.\n\nThat said . . . they weren't completely wrong, or even AHs, to ASK about the master bedroom. You have every right to turn them down of course, but they're not wrong that it's not just about ownership; having a bit of extra space and an ensuite bathroom (I assume) can make a HUGE difference in the care of a baby in the first year or so. They may have been trying to be genuinely practical. I'm not commenting on their \"still having more babies\" because it's not my business. People's reproductive choices are not my business. \n\nAll told, though, you're also a bit of an AH because you are diminishing the HUGE impact of having someone living in your house who pays ALL of the bills and only expects you to contribute towards groceries. I'm not sure that even you realise how drastically your life will change if you suddenly become responsible for all of that. What they are doing for you financially is not negligible. \n\nRight now it seems like there's a lot of resentment building and ESH. I suggest sitting down with them and having a heart-to-heart.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He can rent the whole house out to a family, he can airbnb, or he can rent rooms out and live there.

Yes the house might technically belong to him but if his parents are the only reason he can afford it then I think that muddies the waters a bit.", "I don't get this way of seeing it. That is not his family's house, it's his. His family hasn't had to pay rent for eight years, for five of which he has been an adult.

How are they not TA for asking him to pay more and to babysit and to carry still more of the burden of this large family?", "I don't know. I think more clarification is needed. If the parents don't pay anything towards the home then yes go ahead and kick them out.\n\n\nI got the impression that they paid everything on the home minus groceries.  \n\n\nNow they want the master which is wrong. I chose my verdict simply because op sounded a little inexperienced with household expenses.

A 7 bed home will have a lot of cost.\n\n\n\nOp clarify if you can afford the home or do you actually need your parents money to keep it.", "That's a good point.

Ten people using electricity and water has to be a lot. If the parents are struggling to pay those bills and whatever else they have then they definitely couldn\u2019t afford moving out of the house.

His parents made mistakes but I can't get over that there is more here OP is failing to mention.\n\n\n\n\nBut honestly he definitely needs to work out the finances.  He might not be able to afford the home alone.
