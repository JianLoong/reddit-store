He passed away when I was 15. \n\nAs the house was quite big (7be/4ba), my parents talked to me about our family moving there, as it would be cheaper and accommodate everyone. The only thing I wanted was the master suite for myself and it actually became my bedroom. \n\nCurrently, my mother is 6 months pregnant again.\n\n I work and earn a good salary. I don't pay the house bills, but I help with the groceries. \n\nThis month I started having complaints from my parents saying that I should help more with my younger brothers (I always argue that I'm not their father and that it's their responsibility). As they are so financially tight and started to charge me to pay some bills, because they were not able to and I started to pay some, but not as they wanted. \n\nI had my limit when they suggested I move into their room as they would need space for the new baby and they pay most of the bills so they should have the biggest room. \n\nI told them they can pay most bills, but they don't pay a dime on a huge house and it's only in my name. And if they want more space for their ninth child, I suggest they move to another house, because I am the owner of the house and I won't give up my comfort because they don't stop having children. \n\nThey started calling me an ungrateful son and that they raised me to be empathetic and kind, but I am showing myself to be a cold and extremely selfish person who threatens their own parents to take them out of the house for not agreeing with a suggestion.\n\n I talked to my maternal grandmother, she said that she understands my side, but that I may have been very hard on them, especially since they were my parents. They're not talking to me properly btw. \n\nAITA?\n\nNot US\n\n\nObviously I'm not able to support the house on my own, but it's a great house for rent and only with it I could rent a smaller house and live on that money alone. The fees that are yearly here, my grandfather left a responsible accountant to pay that for me with some money left for this, so no, they don't put money in the house besides bills and any things that break.

The stipulation for them moving in was that you get the Master Bedroom. And they agreed to that.\n\nLastly The only bills you should be paying are those pertaining only to you.

You're 23; live your life and do you.  \n\nI definitely have objections to them asking you for money AT ALL, considering they're making up 90% of every charge there and not paying rent.

Assuming you own the property outright, these are still huge expenses. Can you afford them if they move out? \n\nI don't think it is fair of them to expect you to babysit your siblings but if they are paying the bills on the property, asking for the larger room does not feel out of line. \n\nIt sounds to me like you just need a more formal rental agreement.", "Info: who payed taxes? Who pays upkeep if something breaks? Who pays mortgage? Just trying to sort out who is spending the most money on the house. It wasn\u2019t clear from your post.\n\nEdit to add NTA.", "**ESH**\n\nI'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, I'm sure, as this sub tends heavily towards, \"It's your house so you make the rules\". And you're trying really hard to make it seem just that simple: that you're being really magnanimous by letting them live there (and you are, to a large extent) and they're doing nothing to deserve it (which is where it gets tricky). But *would you even have been able to keep your paternal family home, such a big house with all its property taxes, upkeep, etc., if your parents weren't there paying ALL of the bills?* If you ask them to leave, will you be able to keep it, or will you have to sell it? You say that you're 23 with a \"good salary\" but I know very few 23-year-olds who could afford to keep a 7-bedroom/4-bathroom house. \n\nYour parents are AHs because they ARE taking advantage, and it seems that they've gotten so used to the status quo that they've forgotten just how lucky they are to have a rent-free, mortgage-free home as a family of 10 that's about to grow again. They'd be hard-pressed to find a home that would reasonably fit a family that size even if they WERE paying rent/mortgage. They should be engaging with you with less of a sense of entitlement, for sure.\n\nThat said . . . they weren't completely wrong, or even AHs, to ASK about the master bedroom. You have every right to turn them down of course, but they're not wrong that it's not just about ownership; having a bit of extra space and an ensuite bathroom (I assume) can make a HUGE difference in the care of a baby in the first year or so. They may have been trying to be genuinely practical. I'm not commenting on their \"still having more babies\" because it's not my business. People's reproductive choices are not my business. \n\nAll told, though, you're also a bit of an AH because you are diminishing the HUGE impact of having someone living in your house who pays ALL of the bills and only expects you to contribute towards groceries. I'm not sure that even you realise how drastically your life will change if you suddenly become responsible for all of that. What they are doing for you financially is not negligible. \n\nRight now it seems like there's a lot of resentment building and ESH.

Anywhere else and your parents would have to pay rent and/or mortgage.\n\n>This month I started having complaints from my parents saying that I should help more with my younger brothers (I always argue that I'm not their father and that it's their responsibility).\n\nYou already support them in ways that go way beyond the responsibilities of being an older sibling. Therefore don't argue \"I'm not their father\" instead remind your parents \"I'm not their father but I still keep a roof over their heads\". \n\n>As they are so financially tight and started to charge me to pay some bills, because they were not able to and I started to pay some, but not as they wanted. \n\nTough, if they don't like it they can move out. They have zero right to ask you for a single penny. The financial drain they have put you under is massive. If you weren't housing them you could easily afford to rent out a couple rooms and then you'd have more than enough money to cover all of your bills.\n\n>I had my limit when they suggested I move into their room as they would need space for the new baby and they pay most of the bills so they should have the biggest room. \n\nLmao you are a single person in house with ten people in it. Your parents **should** being paying 90% of the bills since them and their kids are probably responsible for 90% of costs. \n\n>I told them they can pay most bills, but they don't pay a dime on a huge house and it's only in my name. And if they want more space for their ninth child, I suggest they move to another house, because I am the owner of the house and I won't give up my comfort because they don't stop having children. \n\nCharge them rent. Go to a lawyer tomorrow and get a lease drawn up. You'll be amazed at how quickly they shut up. You don't even actually have to start charging them just let them know you're looking into the idea because of how they've been treating you.\n\n>They started calling me an ungrateful son and that they raised me to be empathetic and kind, but I am showing myself to be a cold and extremely selfish person who threatens their own parents to take them out of the house for not agreeing with a suggestion.\n\nInteresting that they claim you threatened to kick them out when in reality you only told them you wouldn't let them boss you around in their own home and that they need to take responsibility for their reproductive choices. This seems like a huge red flag to me. Makes me wonder what their plans for the future are. I can see them expecting you to support them indefinitely. \n\n>I talked to my maternal grandmother, she said that she understands my side, but that I may have been very hard on them, especially since they were my parents. They're not talking to me properly btw. \n\nGranny knows that your parents and siblings are going to be her problem when you finally have enough of their BS.\n\nHonestly if I were you I'd start looking into how I could go about renting some of the rooms. Maybe have a few of the siblings double up and see how much rent each room could pull in. My guess is that you could probably retire before 35 if you play your cards right.", "NTA and oh those expectations people can have blows my mind. If you do not feel comfortable with the situation it is totally up to you to decide what will happen we ith the house. Choose YOU", "NTA. They decided to keep having more kids and that\u2019s their choice. And just as OP stated, it\u2019s not unreasonable to rent it out and gain a decent income on the property. I would probably give them 3-6 months notice that I plan to rent it out. \nAlso what\u2019s the parents plan if OP gets married and decides to have a bunch of kids? It\u2019s his home after all and he\u2019s well within his rights to decide to do something else with the house.", "NTA.  Since your parents don't seem to respect you, go to a lawyer, preferably the one who helped your grandfather and get some advice on how to protect your property and how to draw up a rental agreement for your family to sign.  Put down those things that are deal breakers, like insisting you move out of the master suit, or them failing to pay the bills.  If they don't sign, or do sign and then don't live up to the contract, evict them.  This will be messy, ugly, and painful.  But they are not giving you much choice.", "Quite frankly they should be paying all the bills in lieu of rent. Most of that will be going to supporting their children, after all, which is not your responsibility.\n\nYou allowing them to live in the house with them only paying bills is a huge financial help to them, for which they should be grateful.\n\nIf you are happy living with them you should at least stand your ground with the bills. They are not owed a cent of your money when they are living there rent free. This is a hill to die on. They either respect that, or they need to make other living arrangements.\n\nIf you are not happy living with them, or you feel it is time you left to start an independent life, then rent the house out at market rates with a proper lease and move on. \n\nYou are NTA and your parents are being very entitled.", "\nWas", "NTA\n\nYou aren't responsible for their breeding fetish. But, if they can't afford the bills on this house, with no rent or mortgage, they'll be miserable when they have to pay one of those. Be prepared for lots of pressure.", "100%!!!!!!!!!!! NTA.", "I think what we're seeing here is an abusive situation where the victim has been conditioned their entire life to think this warped way of thinking is normal.", "I\u2019m pregnant with a second child. My first child is 13 years old haha enough time has passed that the trauma has been forgotten.", "No child should be parenting in any way the children you chose to have. That's parentification and it's child abuse.", "always he can rent a room or two", "That's exactly what I did! I got a case of baby fever, but realized that I'm older, I'm tired, and I like my sleep uninterrupted.  So now I have an 11 week old heeler puppy. She's like a little,  furry toddler that is crate trained.  And I get my 8 hours of sleep daily", "I\u2019m so sorry all that is happening\u2014 that\u2019s so much to worry about! Hopefully you\u2019re not in too much pain and the rest of your recovery and pregnancy both go smoothly, and surgery won\u2019t be necessary. Sending you all the healing & healthy baby vibes!", "Sending you all the healing thoughts and vibes in the world \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 I hope that you aren't suffering too much and that you can stay pregnant until she's healthy and safe. I'm so sorry you're in such a difficult situation. I can't imagine breaking multiple bones and having limited pain relief options."]}
