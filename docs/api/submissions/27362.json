{"id": 27362, "submission_id": "16ow9ub", "title": "AITA for not giving my grandson his college inheritance", "selftext": "For background, my mother left my eldest grandchild $40k+ for college. He was a minor when she passed and I was left in charge of the money. She told me it was to be used for his college education. Right out of high school he moved into an apartment and started to attend community college. He had a scholarship for the first two semesters so we weren\u2019t worried about using the inheritance yet. He also paid rent with his own savings from working on the family farm so again, no need for the inheritance at this point. \n\nWell after the first semester he decided college wasn\u2019t for him. He got a job as a heavy equipment operator and lived in the same college town for 4 years. \n\nAfter 4 years of working in construction he moved back home to work on the family farm full time. The farm is owned by my husband and my son(the father of my grandson). My husband is too old to carry on with the strenuous work of farm life, and my son fell into deep depression after divorcing his second wife and started to abuse alcohol. My grandson moved back here and took over all the duties on the farm. \n\nHe\u2019s currently 25 years old and for the last 3 years he\u2019s been running the farm. I do all the bookwork as I have for the last 50+ years, but he does everything else and has helped keep the business afloat. He lives in an RV on the farm property because he doesn\u2019t want to pay rent in town and he says he\u2019s closer to work this way also. \n\nHe says he loves this life and wants to stay farming no matter how much we\u2019ve tried to convince him to get a college degree and pursue something that will make him more money. The only other thing he loves is cooking which he says just isn\u2019t a viable career path for him money-wise, unless he were to open his own deli/restaurant. These last couple months he\u2019s sat down with me and his grandpa and told us he should have access to his college funds. His argument is that he\u2019s 25, has proven he\u2019s independent as an adult, and doesn\u2019t see himself benefiting from college. Also told us that college wasn\u2019t a wise investment for him because of his plans. He says he won\u2019t blow it on stupid things but may use it to jumpstart a business(his deli/restaurant). I refuse to give it to him outright because that money was for college, not for starting a business. He says he feels belittled because he\u2019s an adult and we\u2019re withholding his money from him. But I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case. It was left for college and should be honored as such.

The money was left for him for his educational development. I'd say at this point he knows best how he wants to develop himself. You keeping the money is counter to your mother's intentions.\n\nEDIT: and your own interests are a conflict here, because not giving him the money keeps him on the family property and running the farm that wouldn't work without him.", " YTA- he did GO to college. The second he started that money should have been his. Just because he decided college isn\u2019t for him doesn\u2019t make you entitled to the money.", "YTA\n\nWould you be happier if he took that money, enrolled in college, graduated then didn't use the degree like a good chunk of his peers will? Money well spent, right?  \n\n\nHe went to college without having to pay, he used his savings for his living expenses (where he could have used his inheritance). He then decides college isn't for him, drops out, and gets a job in a skilled trade then works for four years and supports himself. Then he comes home and is devoting his time and energy to the family farm. He wants to use that money to fund his future, he's proven himself to be capable and able- what exactly is the issue?   \n\n\nI feel as though you are living in a time of the past where a 'college education' automatically meant a comfortable life and success. An education is always something to be proud of and is a huge accomplishment, but as many other people will tell you,- it does not guarantee happiness, stability and a good life.", "YTA. You just wanna yoke him to the farm because there\u2019s no one else.\n\nThis is egregious. It\u2019s not yours.", "Fess up. You stole your grandchild\u2019s inheritance. YTA", "YTA\n\nI find it hard to believe that your mother left him this money *only* for college, and didn't want him to have it under any other circumstances. \n\nIf this was a 17yo demanding the money to fritter away, I'd agree to withhold it until they were mature enough to do something sensible with it and set themselves up. You know... like your 25 yo grandson who isn't very academic but is a hard worker trying to establish himself in life.\n\nThink hard about how you'd justify this decision to your mother, including justifying where else you'd allocate this money she left for your grandson.", "YTA for not giving it to him when he went to college for more then a semester. Yeah scholarship is great bur it should have paid for rent, food etc. Moment he entered college it should have been released to him. He did the thing.", "YTA. He loves this life, works hard and has a good head on his shoulders. You are giving him an ultimatum, do what isn\u2019t right for you or no money. If your heart isn\u2019t in it college won\u2019t achieve anything. Why is getting in the rat race constantly chasing money and destroying his spirit so important to you? It\u2019s not your money, if you love and trust him I\u2019m sure your mum would be proud of him", "YTA-  what are you doing with his money?", "YTA! He did attend college. You denying him access to his inheritance is a bad and unethical idea. \n\nHe is helping you keep the farm and business afloat, that should say something about his capabilities of handling life and not throwing it all away.\n\nIt is rightfully his money and if he wants to use it to start his business, then you should let him use that money.\n\nEdit to add - He has proven himself to be worthy of getting that inheritance. You just don't want to see it because his little business might take him away from the farm and your little 'cash cow' will no longer be here.", "YTA. \n\nAnd, $40,000 from 10 or so years ago better be $60 or $70,000 now or you got some explaining to do. \n\nDid you put the money in a medium risk investment account to grow? Or have you just mixed it in with your own funds and now you don\u2019t want to pay it back?\n\nEdit: The average stock market return for the last 5 years was 11.33% (7.28% when adjusted for inflation), for the last 10 years it was 12.39% (9.48% when adjusted for inflation),", "YTA. You didn't hand it over when he was IN college. You're wrong to withhold it now.", "YTA.\n\nHe\u2019s 25. If there is a large inheritance, that is typically when people gain control over it. He went to college for 2 years & it was paid. That money was left to him. He may not be going to uni, but from where I sit, it is still rightfully his.", "What are you saving it for at this point? If you touch it, YTA.", "YTA, you let him use his savings for rent while going to college instead of giving him the money that was left to him for college.\n\nTell him to take a few business courses at the local community college to help learn how to run a deli before he tries to open one up. Or make him create a business plan on the deli. Either way, give him the money to help him finance his career. Waiting till he\u2019s well established is a little backwards", "OP can\u2019t take any responsibility and I don\u2019t think they even like their grandson from the comments they\u2019re leaving. They clearly don\u2019t want the advice or judgement of people here so this is a moot point but YTA\u2026\n\nYou clearly need him to keep the business afloat so giving him his money may screw you over so of course you\u2019re not gonna give it to him. I also think you may have already spent some or all\u2026this is just so weird of a take.", "YTA. Your grandson sounds responsible; taking over the farm the past couple years and limiting his expenditures to save money by living in a trailer etc. He tried the college thing and it didn't take. That is ok; not everybody needs to go to college.\n\nI think the point of the inheritance was to get him a good start in life. At the time it was assumed that meant college and a white collar career. Well looks like he wants to farm and/or open a restaurant/deli which seems perfectly legitimate. Why are you standing in his way'? Do you think if you withold the inheritance, he will magically want to go back to college for some worthless degree that won't help him with the path he is set upon? Honestly, what is your endgame here?\n\nDon't be a jerk. Your grandson is 25, shown responsible life choices, and has been helping YOU out on the farm. Give him the inheritance and wish him well on his future. He may fail but he is an adult enough to take that chance. You cannot deny him the ability to try to make it in this world on his terms.", "YTA. He went to college, he found a passion and is thriving. That money belongs to him. I would have some more choice words for you but being forever disliked by your family should suffice.", "YTA. That money should have been released to him the moment he started college, whether he has scholarships or not. If you had done so, he wouldn't have needed to work, would have been able to focus on and probably finish school, and might never have come home to run the farm. \n\nWhich I somehow suspect you considered. Just as now, you're considering the fact that he wants to use the money to start a business that may once again take him off the farm YOU NEED HIM to run.\n\nThat is not your money. That is your mother's money, meant for him, and you should have given it to him years ago.", "Info:  if he never goes to college, what do you plan to do with the money?", "YTA. The money was for college - a proxy basically to make sure he became a stable, independent hardworking adult.\n\nSounds like he\u2019s achieved that. So now you say it\u2019s for when he marries and has kids. What if he doesn\u2019t? What\u2019s the next goalpost for him?", "YTA just yer this is so fuked up sounds to me like u \n\nA. Are very controlling \nB. Have spent the money already", "Why do I get the feeling he won't ever prove to you that he deserves his rightful inheritance? He already went to college once and you withheld the money from him, even though it could have covered his living expenses so he didn't have to drain his savings. Then he rescued your family farm, he did what two other generations of your family were incapable of, but that still isn't enough to prove to you that he's a responsible adult. Now you're saying maybe he'll get the money if he gets married and finds a career you like.\n\nYou violated your mother's will the moment you withheld his inheritance while he was in school. And now you're moving the goalposts with vague ideas about how you might someday release the money.\n\nYTA, release his inheritance immediately. He has more than proven himself responsible and deserving.", "YTA\n\nGive the man his money.\n\nHe should take you to court over it, honestly.", "YTA \n\n$40k isn't enough to get a 4 year degree once you factor in books and other expenses.  So if he does it your way, he still won't have a degree, he'll have no money left, and for what?  So he can drown in student loans for the rest of his life?\n\nI get it, people who lived through the 80s heard the same thing I did all the time.  College is the only way to secure a future.  But that isn't true anymore.  Tuition has ballooned out of control -- for example, my entire degree only cost me $13k.  Today, that's one year at the same university before living expenses.  Honestly, that info's 3 years out of date, so it's probably even more expensive today.\n\nThat money was so he could build a future, and we were all led to believe that college was the gateway to that, so it makes sense that it would be a requirement in the will.  But that isn't the case in 2023.  The world has changed, and today, college is a trap for most.\n\nStarting a business is also a key to a future.  If he genuinely wants to do that, it's honoring the spirit of the will.\n\nThere's a compromise -- some of the money goes towards courses that would help him with his planned business, the rest for the business itself.  That would give him a stronger foundation to build that future from.", "YTA. That money was intended for him. It doesn't matter how he chooses to use it, your mother left it for him. If you touch it, you're basically stealing from him. It sounds like you want him to keep working in the farm and you don't want him to make his own way in the world.", "YTA.  He's 25, he's running the family farm. You've decided he's not an adult,  nor on YOUR approved career path. He has a career. He has been to college.  You're trying to bully and bribe him into doing what you want. If he did that, he wouldn't BE an adult with his own mind, would he? Give him the money.", "YTA. College isn't for everyone, and it sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders and has a solid life plan, just not the one you'd wish for him. Maybe rethink the whole \"money for college\" thing and consider it \"money for getting a start on your life\", which is what many assume college is for anyway -- even though a degree could be gotten in a subject that wouldn't lead to a high paying career. \n\nIt sounds like he wants to put this money to good use -- would you rather him take out a loan for it when he could be using money that had been set aside for him so that he wouldn't have to go into (as much) debt (for school)((but who says it *has* to be only for school, when school is not in his future))?", "YTA. Some people try college and see it\u2019s not for them. You can not force him.  Help him in starting his life with it! That\u2019s the purpose isn\u2019t it? College is to start a life. He found something without college and can do it. Let him have it.", "YTA - college isn\u2019t everything and it\u2019s not your money to keep. He came home to help run the family farm and from the sounds of it has been doing a great job. He\u2019s working hard and being responsible. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s out partying, he\u2019s living in an RV to save money and wants to use the money to invest in a business. Sounds like he is a smart young man.", "YTA. What exactly are you going to do, keep the money until you die and then he gets it? He isn\u2019t going to college, don\u2019t force him to go just to waste 40k.", "YTA  \nUnless the inheritance was written into the will specifically for college expenses or the money would go elsewhere, it is his for anything at this point. \n\nYour mother is gone, she will never know. College may have made his life different, better, worse, you don't know.  \nThe money can make his life better now & for the future, isn't that what grandma wanted for him, a good start in his future?", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you make the finds available the minute he needed rent?\n\nPresumably you expect him to run the farm from an RV forever while you sit on his money - you are soooooooo TA!", "YTA\n\nHe went to college. You should have given it to him then, regardless of whether he had a scholarship or not. Just imagine if you had given it to him, maybe he would have stayed in school, as he would not have had to worry about money. I can almost guarantee that he felt like he didn't have enough money when he was there, and that likely harkened his leaving. \n\nAnd what do you plan to do with the money now, burn it? Because, as you said, she wanted it to be used for HIS college education. You can't use it for anything other than that if you're going to be that adamant in regards to him getting it. That means it just has to sit there until he either goes to college, or dies. And if he dies, then you have to burn it, because it wouldn't be right to use it for anything other than his college education, right?\n\nTry and think what the intent was. It was likely to help him get a better footing than if he had nothing. She imagined that being a college education, but what if he had a TBI and could never go to college. If she was still alive, would she have said, \"I guess no inheritance for you,\" or would she have decided to give him the money to use to offset his hypothetical TBI and set him up for a better place in life? I'm betting the latter.\n\nSo look at him now. He's a responsible, independent young man, with a sense of family that many never have. He has a stable career, and is happy, yet you won't let him have that cash to further help him along and would rather it sit in some piggy bank, never to be used.", "Yta. And to be frank bordering on being a thief too.  Give him the money that never belonged to you and was always meant for him.  You also owe him any interest he is entitled to as well.  \n\nBut you are the living proof of why money and inheritance should never be trusted to family and must be written into a legal document..  People like you will convince themselves of anything to keep the money.\n\nIt sounds like you need to focus on your own son and quit making judgments on your grandson life.  Your son is the one that needs your help and attention.    You dont even seem to appreciate your grandsons help with the farm.  You just want an excuse to keep the money.", "YTA... he did go to college. Him paying from his savings so no need for inheritance yet is the stupidest thing you could have said. Give the kid the money.\n\nNOT TO MENTION he took over running a fuckin farm... he deserves it more than you certainly do.", "Have you suggested that he take the money and go to culinary school? Loving to cook isn't necessarily a good indicator of being ready to open a whole culinary business", "YTA", "That's a lot of words for \"I already spent the money and now I'm grasping at straws to come up with believable excuses.\" YTA and *if* (doubtful) you still have the money then he's worked his ass off for it so give it to him.", "YTA why would you waste the money on an education he\u2019ll never use? Seems like a huge waste.", "Is he going to inherit the family farm?  I can see that making a difference.", "Yta. It's his money he can use it for whatever he wants. He could go to college and blow it all because he won't use it the degree or drop out, or he could use it for a downpayment on a house or start his business. What kind of idiot are you? Give him the damn money", "YTA College isn't for everyone. He's a stable person, keeping YOUR farm afloat with all his work. He's owed that money. What are you going to do with it if he never goes to college? Crappy of you to behave this way. Especially after he saved your family business.", "YTA. Give him his money and don't be a thief.", "YTA without his working the farm you would go under.  He lives in an F-ing RV.   Stop treating him like hired help.", "YTA. He went to college and you didn't give him any of the money, claiming he had scholarships and a job. Well, you already proved that you never intended to give him the money and now are trying to justify it. You don't say how old he was when your mother passed away, so I'm going to ask directly - how much interest has been gained on that 40k since her passing? Now here's the reality of things, $40k is a drop in the bucket for a college education, even a state school costs more than when you got an education. So the question is, would it be worth him going to college and being frustrated the whole time, and then have loans to pay off at the end of it? Or is it worth using the money as a stepping stone for him as he has already had \"on the job training\" in running the whole farm (aka a business)?\n\nI really don't like the idea that you're keeping the money earmarked for him just because you don't want to lose cheap labor, but I do have to wonder.\n\nYes, YTA if for no other reason than you're sticking to your mother's words and not the spirit behind them.", "Sounds like he needs a lawyer.", "YTA.  WTF didn't he get that money when he enrolled in college?  He never should have had to use his savings for rent.  That's a big part of what that fund was for.  You were, mistakenly, thought to be trustworthy of managing the account while he was a minor.  It's not your place to decide he no longer gets it.  You need to give him the money along with an apology for not giving it to him when you were supposed to.  Otherwise he will probably sue to get that money and he has a good chance of getting it.  I can't help but think your reluctance is because you've spent it on things you shouldn't have.  I hope not, but that's how this story usually goes.", "Does the money still exist?", "So your doing this for following in family foot steps & loving the farm life also? \nYou wouldn\u2019t have the property still if it wasn\u2019t for him it sounds like it. Sorry but YTA. It\u2019s his life & sounds like his made some wise decisions to be a decent man. Holding back something his always been told his his for simply not completing college as he realized it was for him is a full AH move, as shows you care more about your wants than his needs/wants & rather him be unhappy to please you than him actually being happy. How about be grateful you have a grandchild who cares enough to help keep the family business open & going another generation & helping all of you out than walking away. Gratitude goes a long way", "Yta, where is he wrong? Why are you keeping money that was intended to make his life easier and give him a leg up. He\u2019s making smart decisions that actually help you and your family, so be grateful he isn\u2019t looking to abandon the farm.", "YTA\n\nMaybe when you were 25 (back when a person could afford college and an apartment on a part time job) college had a greater significance but today it's not always so important. \n\nYour grandson knows what he's doing, and he's making the right decisions. You're out of touch, controlling and functionally stealing his money since he *did go to college.*", "If it could only be used for college, she should have put it in a college fund rather than leaving it as an inheritance. It is his money, that was left to him. At this point, you have no right to withhold it. YTA", "YTA\n\nI get it. You want him to go to college. I even understand why you value that and believe it will help guarantee his future.\n\nBut.... there's a couple of issues. The first is, he doesn't want to go! He's 25, he's not a teenager. Hell, he's \u00bd a decade through his 20's. He's old enough to know his own mind, or at least old enough to make decisions that he could later regret.\n\nSecond, a **generation** of students just discovered that a college degree isn't enough for success. There's practically an epidemic of young adults with lots of college debt and no line on a career that will easily pay it off (at least in the US). College isn't the guarantee it used to be. He'd have to go to graduate school for the kind of guarantee your son's generation had.\n\nFinally, you're imposing your morals and expectations on another adult. That lack of respect is huge. Of course he's upset and feels infantalized. It's what you admit you're doing!\n\nTalk to him. Talk through his plans. Find a way to make the money work for him - a down payment, starting a new business, an IRA investment - but don't hold hostage this money you know was meant to help shepard him into adulthood.", "YTA\n\nThe money was for him. He tried college, and if he hadn\u2019t had the scholarship he\u2019d already have access to the money.\n\nHe\u2019s kept your farming business afloat. He has created a plan for a new business. What does he have to do to prove to you he deserves money specifically left for him? Is this just your way of keeping him in the farm?", "YTA, just admit you've spent the money and can't give it to him.", "YTA - you\u2019re being petty. What\u2019s going to happen if he never goes to college? It wasted away? What exactly did her will say? There\u2019s a possibility he can take you to court and fight it.", "YTA. Sorry, but your are definitely an AH. This person has proven to be wise, loyal, family oriented, and has done more for you than you for him. \n\nYou are WAY out of line.", "YTA. It was left for him. He should\u2019ve gotten it when he went to school even though he had a scholarship. Now you\u2019re enjoying the control over it. If you don\u2019t give it to him, what\u2019s going to happen with the money?", "YTA and you know it.  You have plenty of excuses for your lazy no good drunk son.  Your grandson deserves the money and honestly I hope he sues you for it. I also hope he stops working on YOUR farm so it collapses and you're all left without anything because of the way you're your grandson.", "YTA: You had no right to keep him from his inheritance while he was in school. He shouldn't have been spending savings. You need to pay him back for robbing his start in life.", "So you stole the money and think it\u2019s ok bc he didn\u2019t ask for it while he was in college? \n\nYTA. Give him his money", "YTA. He\u2019s proven that he\u2019s a capable adult. I get you wanting to follow your mom\u2019s wishes to the letter but he hasn\u2019t done anything to prove that he would use it for anything she wouldn\u2019t approve of. Plus, as other people said, it is really telling that by refusing him his inheritance, you keep him on the farm working for you instead. \n\nEdit: Just read your comments. ARE YOU SERIOUS, WOMAN? You\u2019re trying to use ONE, SINGLE mistake that he made at 19 to justify why he\u2019s not a fully capable adult at 25?! Okay, yeah, a DUI was an issue but even you have said that he hasn\u2019t had a drink since because he saw how detrimental it was to his father! And he\u2019s not only worked a job for four years, but even keeps this farm afloat! And your way of determining if he is a capable adult is if he gets a job that YOU approve of, gets married, and has kids?!\n\nLADY! Wake up and embrace the new era here! His dream of owning a restaurant/deli is A CAREER and he doesn\u2019t NEED to start a family to prove that he is a capable adult and certainly doesn\u2019t need your stamp of approval to be considered one. And don\u2019t use his one run in with cops to try and detract from his accomplishments as an adult. Everyone knows that 18 and 19 year olds are just teenagers who are legally allowed to vote and smoke! \n\nGive that boy his inheritance and let him live his life as he sees fit. He has proven more than anyone that he has earned it.", "I wish ANYONE but you had been put in charge of the money. I think your son would have even done a better job.", "YTA. Part of that money should have been used for his living expenses during the time he attended college. He should not have had to touch his savings for that.\n\nAt minimum, you owe him reimbursement for those college-related expenses.", "YTA. He's not some lazy schlub, he's become a valued and successful farmer, which is an honorable profession. He should get access to the money for a house down payment, farm equipment, or whatever he needs. Doesn't sound like he will be irresponsible with it and college isn't going to be necessary.", "YTA. It's not your money to decided what he wants to do with it. I hope he sue your for stealing his inheritance", "YTA and that money should've been used on rent while he was in college so he could have saved his earnings\n\nI understand the scholarship and so you didn't need it for tuition but college costs include housing.  I'm very surprised you didn't use it then\n\nGive the kid his cash.", "YTA. The money is his", "YTA. It's not your money.", "I would say that the money is for college, but the idea of leaving money so that someone can go to college isn't so that they are forced into a specific thing.

He was a minor when she passed and I was left in charge of the money. She told me it was to be used for his college education. Right out of high school he moved into an apartment and started to attend community college. He had a scholarship for the first two semesters so we weren\u2019t worried about using the inheritance yet. He also paid rent with his own savings from working on the family farm so again, no need for the inheritance at this point. \n\nWell after the first semester he decided college wasn\u2019t for him. He got a job as a heavy equipment operator and lived in the same college town for 4 years. \n\nAfter 4 years of working in construction he moved back home to work on the family farm full time. The farm is owned by my husband and my son(the father of my grandson). My husband is too old to carry on with the strenuous work of farm life, and my son fell into deep depression after divorcing his second wife and started to abuse alcohol. My grandson moved back here and took over all the duties on the farm. \n\nHe\u2019s currently 25 years old and for the last 3 years he\u2019s been running the farm. I do all the bookwork as I have for the last 50+ years, but he does everything else and has helped keep the business afloat. He lives in an RV on the farm property because he doesn\u2019t want to pay rent in town and he says he\u2019s closer to work this way also. \n\nHe says he loves this life and wants to stay farming no matter how much we\u2019ve tried to convince him to get a college degree and pursue something that will make him more money. The only other thing he loves is cooking which he says just isn\u2019t a viable career path for him money-wise, unless he were to open his own deli/restaurant. These last couple months he\u2019s sat down with me and his grandpa and told us he should have access to his college funds. His argument is that he\u2019s 25, has proven he\u2019s independent as an adult, and doesn\u2019t see himself benefiting from college. Also told us that college wasn\u2019t a wise investment for him because of his plans. He says he won\u2019t blow it on stupid things but may use it to jumpstart a business(his deli/restaurant). I refuse to give it to him outright because that money was for college, not for starting a business. He says he feels belittled because he\u2019s an adult and we\u2019re withholding his money from him. But I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case. It was left for college and should be honored as such. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, your alcoholic son\u2019s portion of the trust should be contingent upon alcohol testing and regular therapy sessions. \n\nFor example, my trust is set up so each of my kids only gets a set amount every 5 years. They may withdraw more for major medical (lifesaving) expenses for themselves, legal children (not partner\u2019s kids), and/or spouse up to a certain percentage of the balance; however, the money is sent directly to the medical institution. \u201cExtra\u201d money can also be withdrawn for secondary education (money sent directly to the school) and down payment of a home (up to a certain amount and sent directly to the lender).\n\nAlso, if one of my children dies, that child\u2019s part of the trust goes back to his or her siblings. I would include in your trust that your alcoholic son\u2019s remaining portion of the trust will then be transferred to your grandson (after his dad drinks himself to death).
