My parents divorced 5ish year's ago and agreed to stay single and raise my sister until she is 18, to keep a happy family picture to the public. My dad (45)has been financially supporting my mother for over 15 years now, she's never paid her own bills since they got married. She read through the messages and not only found out mom\u2019s been hooking up with this guy for 3 years now but has planned out-of-state vacations and disguised them as business trips to keep it on the DL from our dad (45). Dad has kept to his word and stayed single and pushed other women away, as they originally agreed. We sat down with Dad not too long ago and I told him everything. All the nicknames, all the pictures, and every trip she planned to meet with this guy. It caused a week-long constant argument between all of us with mom and my sister on one side (mom didn't do anything wrong) and dad and myself on the other side (she should have kept her word or been upfront and honest about her new guy). My mother blames me for ruining her relationship with my dad because I outed her and her secret boyfriend but Dad and I have gotten closer since and he has cut her off financially. She can afford her own bills but she had to cut back on how many times she gets her hair and nails done. Dad has started going out and meeting new people and has generally improved his social life and mental health since he found out. It\u2019s been awesome seeing him perk up and be happy again. He told my grandparents and other family members and everyone says I did the right thing but I\u2019m not so sure anymore. I feel bad about outing her because of the rift that has been torn between my sister and I but nothing changed between my mother and me, we never got along anyway. \nShould I have kept it to myself or AITA for telling my dad?\n\nTLDR: my sister showed me proof my mothers been seeing a guy which went against the original agreement her and my dad made when they divorced and it caused a huge argument and my mother blames me even though everyone else in the family agrees I did the right thing.\n\nEdit for clarification: dad has custody of my sister, my mother still lives with my dad, and her and this guy have been \u201ctogether\u201d 3 years.", "created_utc": 1683549824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bnzol/aita_for_outing_my_moms_secret_to_the_family/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well you got that! And you got validation from your dad.\n\nYour mom should not have been sneaking, but she seemed to be trying to honor the request of not breaking up the home for your sister. \n\nHer sneaking is not right, **but how are you to know your dad wasn\u2019t also dating?** Maybe you just didn\u2019t happen upon the information as you did with your mom.\n\nThis seems spiteful. She\u2019s is wrong, but that wrong was between her and your father. You wanted to insert yourself, and not minding your own business has consequences. And it seems here, that\u2019d be a schism with your sister, who btw will be effected most while you\u2019re insulated as an adult.", "What a BS agreement. Why would yall want her to stay single and supposedly unhappy for YEARS. We aren\u2019t talking about 6 months until graduation, or until divorce is through, or something like that. She is supposed to waste years of her life for some weird agreement that is most likely only some weird power play and totally not to protect anyone.", "This isn\u2019t real. This reads like a teenager wrote it.", "Divorced but living together to keep up the happy family persona. \nWhat is with the toxic parenting levels on Reddit lately?\nESH. 15 for snooping. Mom for lying (but good for her for actually trying to be happy). Both parents for this ridiculously unhealthy arrangement based on social appearance to begin with. You for involving yourself in any of their personal relationships. \nIt\u2019s likely that none of what you learned growing up about relationships is healthy. Please know that.", "YTA This entire set up is ridiculous. And for all you know, your dad has a secret gf, you just haven\u2019t snooped through his stuff to find out.", "INFO: are your parents names Tom and Katie?", "ESH\n\nFrom stupid arrangements to snooping", "ESH.  Your mom shouldn\u2019t have done it but considering that your parents are divorced already and this was a short term arrangement it probably would have been better to just let it work itself out.  The whole idea of them staying single after a divorce was really a dumb idea to start - what a weird agreement.  What your mom was doing really wasn\u2019t hurting anyone.\n\nAnother option would have been to privately confront your mom and have her call off that ludicrous agreement so your dad could have seen other people too.", "ESH - you for sticking your nose in other people's business.  Your parents for making such a dumb agreement.", "Your mom didn't break any agreement.  She is still single and she hasn't even introduced you or your sister to her bf.  You violated her privacy by snooping through her computer.

The point of this (stupid) arrangement supposedly was to protect and benefit your minor sister.  How exactly do you think it protected and benefitted her for you to blow it up?", "ESH\n\nFirst off - the no dating rule was stupid and not going to work.  \n\nSecond - you're an AH for allowing your sister to snoop and for looking yourself.  \n\nThird - your mother wasn't cheating because your parents are divorced.   She lied, yes, which makes her an AH as well.  But she didn't cheat.  \n\nFourth - you should have gone to your mother first so she would talk about their agreement with your dad.  \n\nAgain ***no one cheated here***.  The deal was stupid and doomed to fail from the start.  You can't expect single people to not want affection.  Your father definitely at least talked to people online.  He just didn't get \"caught\".  \n\nYou're too old to be this naive.", "YTA, and tbh, I think it was *you* who went snooping, and then tattled to daddy on your mother.", "You don\u2019t know why they divorced but for some reason you sure seem to hate your mom, and take delight in seeing her punished in a way that will probably also affect your sister. Their ridiculous agreement should never have been disclosed to you and your sister; but since you know, ask yourself what kind of man uses money as a hammer to hold your mom hostage like this. \n\nIt\u2019s gross that you\u2019ve been made privy to the private details of your parents\u2019 lives. And it seems really crappy that you have no compassion for a woman who no doubt got lonely and is only human. (Also don\u2019t be so sure your dad doesn\u2019t have his own secrets.)", "So like... your parents entered into an agreement that was clearly making them both miserable. Now that it's broken, your dad's mental health and social life are greatly improved. Your mom obviously figured out that her mental health and social life were suffering, and she took steps to improve them without disturbing the \"happy family picture to the public\" -- which was the stated goal of that agreement.\n\nYou and your sister are the ones who broke that \"happy family picture\". Congrats! Now your sister gets to spend her last three years at home in a miserable situation. You should have asked her what she wanted to happen, because she's the one who suffers now. YTA.", "YTA. You and your Dad have no right to expect her to carry on pretending to be married. She is single and allowed to act like it. Grow up and stop demanding she present a false happy family facade to the public. Try letting your Mother be actually happy instead.", "ESH. You had NO business outing on your mom like that. Your sister shouldn't have been spying on your mom like that. And your parents for frankly trying to come up with this convoluted system to keep your sister supported when that could (and probably was) part of the dissolution of the marriage in the courts. \n\nHave they never heard of child support?", "INFO: Who\u2019s idea was this agreement, and what was the point of their getting divorced if they had to continue to pretend to be married?", "YTA - you and your father, both.\n\nYour mother didn't cheat on your father, she has every right to have a new relationship, and it sounds like she did a good job of keeping it discreet. You seem to have a grudge against your mother and are trying to harm her for only your own satisfaction, with no concerns over how this could impact your sister.\n\nI sincerely hope your father cutting off your mother means only non-legally obligated money for her, specifically, and is not cutting off aid to his daughter - he still absolutely has an obligation to her as a minor.", "NTA. *We sat down with Dad not too long ago and I told him everything.* It looks like her little sister was in on the conversation. OP's dad made an agreement in good faith. Why should her dad continue to pay for his ex's lifestyle, when it is based on a lie?", "Whoa. So your mom still lives with your dad? And the agreement was no romantic relationships until your sister is 18? Sounds like dad upheld his end while your mom lasted two years. \n\nNTA. \n\nBut I find it interesting that a 15 yo needs a babysitter. And maybe the co-living past divorce worked, but that\u2019s odd especially if your mom can support herself. Your dad did need to know because your mom broke the agreement and has been lying about it for 3+ years.", "YTA", "YTA for snooping and letting your sister, whom you were babysitting, snoop.\n\nAnd even a bigger one for taking the information you found that way and giving it to your father.\n\nYour mother had you as a result of a teenage pregnancy. The arrangement that was made was not a good one, but it was their arrangement. It is none of your business. \n\nYou invaded her privacy and then you abused the knowledge you gained from that. The result? Your father also has a relationship (which is fine) AND he cut her off. So your mother, who had you as a teenager, and probaby missed a lot of chances in life because of that, now has to raise a 15-year-old with a lot less money. And your sister will now have to deal with 2 stepparents (no longer in the DL but actually in the open).\n\nI can only see one winner in this whole situation and that is your father. Who frankly appears to have held your mother hostage in not being allowed to go on with her life at the risk of destitution. He now gets to openly date someone else, play the victim nonetheless and keep all his money to himself. \n\nProud of yourself?", "Maybe controversial but NTA. Your Mum is supposed to be an adult and an example yet she lied and financially abused your Dad for 3 years. Yes this arrangement was meant to protect your sister but keeping it to yourself is just teaching her that lying is not only ok but fine to do over a long period of time. Your Dad sounds awesome, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s feeling more like himself.", "I think I'm going to go with NAH although I'm not sure anything quite hits the spot. There are definite elements of everyone sucking, you and your dad in particular, but relationships are complicated things so I'm being generous.\n\nThe original agreement was silly, at best (and deeply controlling at worst). It may have seemed helpful at the time, but it long ago outlived any usefulness it had and created a weird situation not allowing anyone to properly move on with their lives. You do sound very excited about how happy moving on is making your dad, but very judgemental about your mother having essentially done the same thing, and you might want to reflect on whether that's entirely fair. Also, 'agreed to keep a happy family picture to the public' could very easily be interpreted as 'keep your romantic life quiet' rather than not having one at all. If your mother has been paying lip service to the agreement purely to benefit financially then that's not great, but we don't know that's what happened. Consider that a woman who has 'not paid her own bills' throughout a marriage in which she had children may well have suffered considerable financial disadvantage from having caring responsibilities and have quite appropriately required financial support upon divorce. \n\nSnooping through your mum's personal business and then sharing it with your dad was monumentally crappy. \n\nYour dad unilaterally cutting off financial support to your mum was also crappy (and potentially legally questionable depending on child support requirements and the terms of their divorce). \n\nAll in all, this is a big mess. You don't sound as though you particularly like your mum, but if you want to retain a relationship with your sister then I'd encourage you to build bridges all round. I hope you're able to do that.", "YTA. That's none of business. And stop snooping through other people's stuff.", "YTA - i hope your mother never speaks to you again.", "Wow. Wow. Wow. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Stay out of grown folks\u2019 business.", "ESH aside from your sister - The arrangement was extremely bizarre.

I don't know how much he was providing nor how much he was providing for his share of supporting their minor child that apparently lives with the mother.  Without details on that, I was silent on that aspect.", "Wait, what? Your sister is adopted and nobody bothered to tell her about it and she found out through this!? And your big concern here is about your mum maybe getting to have more spending money than you think she should, rather than the massive psychological toll so this will be having on your sister???\n\nYour family seriously, *seriously* need to learn how to talk openly about things instead of pretending they aren't happening.", "Doesn't make you less of TA for tattling.  You said you were babysitting your sister, obviously not very well if she was snooping through your mother's laptop.  She's old enough to know better to snoop, and you're old enough to keep your nose out of business that isn't yours. YTA", "IMO, it\u2019s too hard to judge without that info. If your dad forced the agreement, it\u2019s an ESH situation. If your mom did, NTA.", "So you thibk your mother makes enough money to pay child support, but not enough to \"get her hair and nails done\" as you say in other comments? You seem to have a very weird view of your mother. Be careful the weird relationship between your parents doesn't influence how you see women.", "NTA. Reading your comments it\u2019s a horribly messy situation and I think you were trying to do right by your dad", "But what arrangements were there legally? Or did they refrain from making it official because of the arrangement they made?\n\nIn my country, it is very likely that an ex husband has to pay alimony and child support. And also: these arrangements were made exactly for the benefit of the child and the outward appearances. They were never meant or should have never meant to stop living for half a decade. Why on earth would you throw that out in the open? It is very comparable to finding toys in the mother's nightstand and putting pictures of that on Facebook. People have sex. So does the mother. You don't make that public.", "Wrong actually. My mother got pregnant with myself at 17 but my inactive, abandoning waste of space bio father who never paid a dime for me. She met my dad when I was 8 and they got married and he WILLINGLY supported mom. My sister was adopted when I was 12 and she was 2. Mom has always worked and the longest she\u2019s been without a job was a week. My dad is a retired veteran who has full financial support of my sister and mom don\u2019t have to pay child support only pay her personal expenses. They divorced for a multitude of reasons I was not told.", "True, this whole thing just sounds to weird to actually be true, now I\u2019ve thought about it.", "They mutually agreed to not date, she's the one that broke that agreement, he pulled the funds for lying/ going behind his back. That's not controlling, that's being nice and making sure his ex is supported, but then discovering she's been abusing his niceness.", "Having a child young doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to suffocate your child and not let them live a reasonable teenage life. It makes you a hypocrite.", "Agreement was indeed really stupid but she agreed to it and was being financially supported as a result of that agreement so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f play stupid games\u2026?", "\u201cThe mother\u201d lives with OP\u2019s dad in his house. She was taking advantage specifically because of the fact that she was taking his money AND he was hosting her under the pretense of the agreement being followed.", "She has a boyfriend which means she is no longer single. Why would she keep the relationship secret from him otherwise? NTA, but your mom certainly is.", "They told me they planned on telling her when she was 18. She found out and took it rather well. My big concern here is whether or not I should have outed my mother. My dad has treated her like a princess and instead of being open and honest she kept her new man a secret for 3 years and continued to live off my dads financial stability because she knew he\u2019d quit supporting her and she wouldn\u2019t be able to afford getting her hair and nails done every two weeks.", "She don\u2019t pay child support, dad made sure she wouldn\u2019t have to.", "Yes he would probably owe alimony (at least where I live) for the sole fact that it looks like she was a SAHM.", "Wait, you literally have no empathy. Or at very least no understanding of how teenage pregnancy, then being abandoned by a deadbeat would effect how protective your mom is.\n\nYou act like your stepdad is a savior, and maybe he is, but your mom was a kid with a kid trying to make sure you didn\u2019t experience what she did. She was likely smothering, And maybe getting some feelings as in family therapy would be beneficial. \n\nBut you seem pretty hell-bent on being hyper resentful of her while painting your dad as perfect.\n \nEven calling your stepfather \u2018dad\u2019 in the post versus calling your biological mom \u2018mother\u2019 is pretty telling.", "Then their whole arrangement seems absolutely bizarre. Why divorce and then force celibacy on each other? Pent up adults forced to co-parent with each other without getting to move on with their lives is not going to make for a healthy home life. Nor will it model an example of healthy relationships for their children. It's not surprising that your mom moved on... why wouldn't she? She's divorced. Not being open about it and renegotiating her arrangement with your dad was a bad move on her part, but the arrangement itself made no sense already.\n\nIt's good that they've dropped the weird farce now, but I do think it would have been better to have approached your mom first about it, you know? Give her the chance to come clean with your dad instead of creating additional drama by \"outing\" her (especially since she's not reliant on your dad, which makes their arrangement both unnecessary AND unhealthy).\n\nIt sounds like all's well that ends well so your actions didn't do much more than finally tear the bandaid off so they could both move on with their lives, but I do think you didn't go about it the best way. Probably because you don't seem to like your mom.\n\nI'm hesitant to pass a judgment here but I think I'd lean towards ESH: your parents for making such a nonsensical, problematic, arrangement in the first place; you for using this as an opportunity to out your mom/create drama; and your sister for snooping in someone else's belongings.", "The \"father\" may have had side pieces as well. Just because you have kids and divorce doesn't mean the vagina or penis withers away and falls off or closes shut.", "My mother and I don\u2019t get along at all, even before this mess. We couldn\u2019t have a conversation without it turning into a screaming match. I\u2019d ask her \u201chow was work?\u201d \u201cHow was school?\u201d Etc and all I\u2019d get in reply is \u201cit was (occasion) OP how do you think it went?\u201d The moment she walked through the door it was complain, complain, and complain some more. After that, it\u2019s also been the belittlement (used to work fast food as a teen up til I got my better job almost a year ago), weight shaming, telling me \u201cyou\u2019d be pretty IF you\u2019d do your makeup\u201d you need to dress like a girl, that dress makes you look fat, etc.", "Babe, I don\u2019t want to be cruel, but this was a get back.\n\nThat\u2019s fine! Seemingly well earned! But your sister\u2019s experiences are not yours, so this was not going to be experienced by her in the same way as it was for you. \n\nSo your get back has a cost. The issue with your sister.\n\nYour moms actions have a cost. Your very fractured relationship.\n\nA lot of times the get back does not feel better. It seems like it will in our head, but sometimes the cost is a bit steep. This seems like a situation that sucks all around. \n\nI would really encourage therapy, because the bad relationships ship with your mom doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be an active participant in her bs. Her lies will come to light, so you don\u2019t need to be her karma.", "I didn\u2019t do this to make her miserable, to get her back, or anything like that. I did this to make sure she couldn\u2019t continue to take advantage of my dad, who has never stopped financially supporting her even after the divorce.", "If you found out the same about your dad, would you have told her?", "Yes! That\u2019s what people aren\u2019t getting, if the situation was reversed I\u2019d do the same thing."]}
