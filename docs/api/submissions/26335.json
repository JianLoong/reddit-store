Yesterday was my older sisters birthday and I am very close to her, she is like my best buddy and fortunately we live in the same city. So for her birthday i bought some very expensive pastries (5 peices) from her favourite bakery. Same day my gf was also spending night at my apartment. Around 7.30 pm i told my gf that I am going to gym I'll be back in 1 or 1 \u00bd hour and when I was leaving I told her not to eat those pastries. After coming back from gym and showring and all we went to the kitchen to make something to eat and I saw there was plate in sink. I checked the pastry box and 2 pieces were gone. Naturally I got angry asked my gf why did she eat those when I told her not to and instead of getting an apology i got she was hungry and there 3 still left for my sister. After arguing back and forth I just asked her to get out of apartment for not respecting my one simple request. After that I drove back to the bakery I bought some more pastries and celebrated sis's bday nicely around midnight. \nFast forward morning I got some hateful text from my gf and her roommate saying how can I ask her leave so late at night and some some profanities.

Not cool of her at all. I don't care what time of night it was, if she didn't want to get in an argument with you about that then she shouldn't have done it.  \n\nGf is the AH though.  If she's doing some territorial bs or feeling insecure about whatever she needs to communicate that with you not directly defy one simple and logical request. She could have asked \"well why didn't you get me anything? You knew I was coming over and I like that stuff too? \" to which you could have said any number of things but also offered to get her some while you were out of it was that big of a deal to her. But that's a total red flag in my opinion.", "Your GF ate those pastry's to prove a point, that she means more to you than your sister.\n\nWell, she pissed against the wrong tree.\n\nNTA\n\nINFO: what is wrong with going home at 10PM? Do you live in a dangerous part of town?", "NTA\n\nYour gf blatantly ignored a request and disrespected you. You very clearly made a point that she couldn't eat those pastries. She deserved to be booted. You should have made her pay for them before she left.", "NTA.  You GF's inability to follow one simple request regarding a birthday present is a red flag.  I am sure there are probably more flags that you are not seeing.", "NTA \n\nyou set some pretty clear boundaries and explicitly told your GF not to eat those pastries. your GF is 24, she's an adult, yet she failed to follow directions a toddler can understand. kicking her out is teaching her a lesson about you and your boundaries, its up to her to respect them.", "NTA.  If she hadn\u2019t eaten the pastries you specifically asked her not to, she wouldn\u2019t have been asked to leave.  To do it on purpose, knowing they were for your sister\u2019s birthday, tells me she doesn\u2019t think much of your sister.", "NTA.\n\nYour GF did not respect your boundaries. You explicitly told her that the pastries were not for her to eat, and she ate them anyway. People who can't respect your boundaries in your own home don't get to enjoy the privileges of being a guest in your home.", "NTA: your house your rules, and you already set boundaries she purposely crossed.", "NTA, but don't you mean ex-gf?", "\"This is not about the Iranian yogurt.\" This isn't just about pastries. It's about respect for your boundaries and requests. She intentionally ate the pastries to prove her feelings outweigh your sister's happiness. She could have called Uber eats or made something to eat, but instead, she ate the one thing you told her not to. \n\nAlso, she kicked herself out. Besides, she has an apartment. You didn't kick her out into the streets. It's not like taxis or Ubers stop running at 10pm. I bet she's gone home later than that before (from dinner,  a movie,  the club, etc.). \n\nTell her roommate to lock up her pastries. NTA", "NTA. Just because it's night doesn't absolve her of her actions. The implication here is, oh it's okay to kick her out for what she did, as long as it's in the middle of the day? No, it's either okay, or it is not okay. And it was definitely the right move. It could have been 3am and it would still be the right move. She got there fine, she can go home fine.", "NTA.  You asked her to do ONE thing and she just couldn't do it.  And no, 10pm is NOT late - she's not 2 although she certainly acted like it.", "NTA, she was childish and ignored your request. Who the hell thinks it's okay to eat someone else's birthday pastries?", "NTA.  They were a gift for someone else.  It was very disrespectful for her to take them.  \n\nThis is a useful piece of information about your girlfriend.  It says something important about her character.\n\nYou shouldn't have left her in danger.  So if it's unsafe where you are for women to walk around at 10 pm, then you should have driven her home.  \n\nHowever, I'd think about why you're dating her.", "NTA\n\nYou are never the AH when you have dodged a bullet.  Change your locks and tell her to hit the road.  She has no respect for you.", "NTA. GF almost seems like she ate the pastries BECAUSE you told her not to. Is there any chance she is jealous of your relationship with your sister and was upset you bought these \u201cexpensive\u201d pastries for her, and not for your gf?\n\nAlso, roping her roommate into it is just plain childish", "NTA you were clear, crystal clear at that, and she still felt entitled to do what she wanted. This kind of lack of boundaries and respect for your wishes is a red flag. What else would she be willing to do that you'd prefer she didn't?", "NTA\n\nI'd go so far as to say this was her way of asserting dominance, or testing your loyalty to your sister. Some people get very territorial about family, and want to be more important that all the other people you love, all the time.\n\nSerious red flag. I'd consider not letting her back in. This is not about pastries.", "NTA she should\u2019ve had any sort of respect for your wishes and not deliberately eat your sisters birthday gift", "Cut her put of your life. She should have been looking for ways to celebrate your sister, not steal from her\nFind a better woman", "NTA. This would be grounds for me to break up immediately. Especially after she ropes her roommate into her pity party to berate you. The gull on some people\u2026unbelievable.", "NTA full stop. \n\nHow glutinous does a person have to be to have that little self control? The pastries were a gift for another person and she knew it. Instead of getting something else to snack on, waiting, or going out for something, she chose to eat something that didn't belong to her. \n\nThis is such an unattractive quality on a partner. I'd have been livid as well. NTA", "Nta\n\nShe doesn\u2019t respect you enough to simply not eat a damn pastry, dump her", "NTA, 10pm is not that late. It\u2019s not like you kicked her out at 3am.", "nta, i know it's a small thing, but it also was a super fucking easy thing to not eat the pastries you had set aside for a special occasion. for something so small, this feels like a massive red flag.", "NTA\u2026 you were very specific. She was 100% testing a boundary and she FAFO", "NTA.", "She seems to think that she prioritize herself over your sister the fact that she didn't apologize and just blatantly took something that didn't belong to her and eating it after being told not to, and she doesn't even live there when they're probably with other things, she could've eaten sounds like she's self-centered, and to bring her roommate into the conversation in  your relationship is definitely a juvenile move", "NTA. \n\nMy cats have whisker measuring contests in dinner time and eat each other's food for dominance. Your GF is doing the same thing. When my cats do it, one gets locked in the bedroom with her own food.\n\nHowever, my suggestion for your girlfriend would be to have a sit-down talk about respecting your boundaries or dumping her if she doesn't agree.\n\nTo clarify to everybody reading this, I am not suggesting op locks their girlfriend in a room. It's this funny thing called a joke and it's strictly about my cats.", "NTA, play a stupid game win a stupid prize. I seriously doubt those pastries were the only food in your apartment", "NTA she tried to show you she has the balls to do as she wants. She FAFO.  Reconsider this relationship. She will only get worse.", "She was hungry,  and the oooonnnlllyyy thing available to eat in the apartment were the pastries you told her not to eat, right? \n\nThat was a power play; she had a point she wanted to prove. \n\nYour response was absolutely right. NTA", "NTA and she has shown you what type of person she is, She isn\u2019t willing to follow a simple request because it didn\u2019t benefit her, I wouldn\u2019t be letting her into my apartment ever again.", "Doesn't fulfil a simple request to not eat someone else's gift. Makes lame excuse for it. Then proceeds to abuse you through text with her roommate. She sounds like the whole package.\n\nDude you know you are NTA.", "NTA.\nAre you dating someone with the mind of an infant?\nIf I were to ask someone (let alone my SO) to NOT eat something, because it\u2019s for someone\u2019s BIRTHDAY, I would expect a yes 100% of the time, unless it\u2019s a child. She\u2019s immature and you need to get that across to her", "Omg! The Iranian yogurt lives! I guess Reddit has a long memory. You did the right thing.NTA!", "NTA. both Of my grandchildren are under 8 and understand when I tell them what treats are theirs and what aren\u2019t. your GF thought you would let her get away with it. You didn\u2019t. Stand firm, actions have consequences and if she doesn\u2019t know that at the age of 24, do you really want to be the one teaching her boundaries?", "NTA and 10 pm isn\u2019t that late. She (and her flying monkey) are definitely DARVO\u2019ing you with that \u201cso late\u201d thing. She\u2019s in the wrong, but somehow she\u2019s mad at you?! Classic.", "NTA. That was incredibly rude of your girlfriend. She was disrespectful and maybe even a little jealous that you got a nice gift like that for your sister. 10pm isn\u2019t that bad and I\u2019m sure on nights out, she has been out on her own later than that. I\u2019m sure she wasn\u2019t left on a dark street in the middle of nowhere. You don\u2019t need to apologise, but she does.", "NTA. She crossed a boundary on purpose. She knew those were a gift for someone else, that you had told her not to eat, and she took them anyway. At best she's a selfish brat. At worst she's trying to test you somehow. I would have a think about why you're with someone like that.", "NTA\n\nBut consider how it affects the future.\n\nYou told her not to eat them. You don't say you told her why, but still, you told her *don't eat those things*. She went and ate them. That's shitty behavior, intentional even.\n\nBut..y'know.. if she's worth keeping, angry words plus getting them (or asking her to go replace the two) might have done a bit better when all interests are considered.", "NTA- she broke your boundaries and you should not have to apologize for your actions!", "NTA it's so blatant that it seems like she might have been testing you to see if you would prioritize her over your sister.", "Nta \n\nGf shit tested you and found out, and refused to apologize\n\nProps on being a good brother as well \n\nAlso unless super sketch 10pm isn't crazy", "NTA\n\nDon't apologize", "NTA. She fucked around, she found out.", "NTA. You should seriously consider breaking up though, because if she disrespected a boundary like this, who knows what she'll be like with bigger ones. At 24 years old, she should know not to eat food when someone tells her not to eat it. She was being a jerk because she was jealous that you got your sister something, which is just weird because it's normal for family members who are close to buy each other gifts.", "NTA. She left the plate out so you'd see it.", "People worried about a 24 yr old out at 10pm\u2026don\u2019t. She is out and about with friends much later than that on the regular is my assumption.", "It seems that she doesn't respect your sister, you, or your boundaries.\n\nNTA, instead of sending her home, next time just don't invite her.", "Nta. What an ahole to eat them! She was playing a stupid game and won a stupid prize. Who cares if its 10 pm? You didnt dump her out in the country like a dog! (Poor dogs \ud83d\ude2d).   Is she often a jerk like this?", "Lol I would have kicked her out too ungrateful a s s.", "Where on you live that a bakery that sells pastries (not Dunkin) is open late at night?", "NTA If your GF has keys to your apartment, get the locks changed.  She is a thief.  She knew exactly why you bought those pastries, and she was determined to show you that she could do whatever she wanted to do.  You deserve better.", "did she at least leave a note along the following:\n\nThis Is Just To Say\nI have eaten\ntwo pastries \nthat were in\nthe kitchen\n\nand which\nyou were probably\nsaving\nfor your sister\n\nForgive me\nthey were delicious\nso sweet\nand so cold", "Nope", "Definitely NTA. If she can\u2019t honor that simple request \u2026 that sets a bad precedent for the future (if you even decide to stay with her).", "NTA at all\u2026 you told her specifically not to touch the pastries. She did it to prove she was more special than you sister or was jealous. But for her to say she was hungry and that was it. You can\u2019t tell me there was nothing else in the house but the pastries or that she couldn\u2019t have waited an hour for you or even gotten food on her own. She knew what your were doing with the pastries and did it anyway. She doesn\u2019t really sound caring at all and then to try and flip it back on you. Keep her out", "NTA. You made a simple request and she blew you off.", "She clearly does not repsect you or your decisions. Her not apologizing is clearly a red flag. If it were me I would have replaced those pastries with an apology. NTA.", "NTA. You should also consider your GF's behavior. Women show you who they are with actions not words. This is who she is. Are you comfortable continuing a relationship with someone who will do this in the future?", "Nta I think you should break up with her. She doesn't recognize boundaries. I think that's a red flag.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a red flag.  She wasn't apologetic, she ate the food to get a reaction.  She didn't like the reaction.  She's was bratty and threw a hissy fit.  If she hadn't been specifically told NOT to eat them, it would be one thing...but she did it out of spit.  Not a good person.", "A GF that can\u2019t cook a meal for herself when hungry is not mature enough for a relationship. Is she under the impression you\u2019re her daddy?", "Oh no honey. That was a test and you failed. Good for you. \n\nNTA.", "You = not the asshole.", "NTA. Nah you told her to not eat them. She knew they were for your sister n then she gave a shitty response after. Not even an apology was given.", "NTA - if they had been sitting there for a week, ok, sure. It was a couple hours. They were fresh and a gift for your sister. She couldn\u2019t make herself something else? Is she too good for cereal or chips and dip? \nWhy didn\u2019t she start making dinner for you all if she was soooo hungry? Again, NTA", "NTA.\n\nGF knew they were a gift for someone else, knew she was told not to touch them, ate them anyway, and left the dirty plate out on purpose. \n\nThink of it like this: had you bought 5 pairs of nice expensive earrings for your sister and GF stole, wore, and lost 2 pairs after being told not to mess with them, would the GF and ger roommate still feel like they were in the right?\n\n\n10pm in a city large enough to have a specialty fancy pastry shop is not late, especially for a mid-20s year old. The Korean-French bakery nearish me stays open until midnight on weeknights, later on weekends, and is constantly full of people getting baked goods and drinks. And there's a donut shop in Austin, that isn't a chain like Amy's or Demolition, that has hours opposite 'normal' donut shop hours ie mid afternoon - late night. So replacing them at night isn't weird, especially in large metro areas with decent freeways/highways. \n\nGF has access to Uber, Lyft, Google for a taxi company, and should have a credit card for emergencies like this, or had her own vehicle for leaving in the morning.", "She ate the pastries and left the dish unwashed - who was supposed to clean it? Chase the lazy mare!", "What bakery is open at like 10pm? Lmao", "Did you have to walk home or did she have transportation? She had to walk then yeah I would say that that was a bad move. But if she had transportation or an Uber then what's the big deal?", "Yes. It was excessive.\n\nYou don't kick someone out for eating pastries.", "ESH - as you stated the pastries were easily replaceable. You overreacted. There\u2019s more information that you\u2019re not sharing that would paint a more clear picture.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
