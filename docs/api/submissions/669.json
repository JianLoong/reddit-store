If this were a non-child ceremony in your hometown and your sister babysat the kids while you attended the wedding, it would be the same, yes?\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s a brilliant solution. \n\nThis would make me think twice about attending the wedding at all.", "NTA that is a perfectly acceptable solution. They're being unreasonable. There WILL be kids in this town even if they don't want kids at the wedding. Your kid being with your sister isn't going to impact the wedding.", "NTA. You\u2019re not bringing the kid to the wedding or the resort. Your daughter and sister will be at a different resort.\n\nThe couple should not expect you to be by their side 24/7 during the event, so what\u2019s their issue if you meet your daughter at a cafe or somewhere else between wedding related events?\n\nBTW: what has your BF said?", "NTA - you're not trying to bring your kid to the wedding. not in the slightest. What you do when you're NOT at the weddings is immaterial and not their business.", "NTA! There is nothing wrong with having a no kids policy at locally held weddings. However, this is a DESTINATION wedding, held in another country. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't leave my child behind either and not only did you just totally come up with a genius idea to have your child near you but you're also complying with the couple's wishes. Problem is, this is NOT good enough for them because they think you're going to pull a fast one. I'm sorry, but if I were you, I'd forgo the wedding and hang out with your kid and sister. You're very lucky to have a boyfriend who stands up for you:) You're a good mother, because you're part of the solution. Those people are the problem. They'll get over it.", "Are they gonna assassinate any kid who happens to be at the resort? Wipe out the town? WTF LOL Obviously nta. I wouldn't go, though.", "So you\u2019re kids not even allowed in the same country? Wow talk about a bridezilla. NTA maybe just take a family vacation instead of attending that dramafest", "Nta and honestly screw them and their dumb wedding if they think they are more important than your kid.", "Thanks y\u2019all \u2764\ufe0f I needed the reassurance. I\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to figure out if I over stepped. I don\u2019t know if we will go or not. I feel super guilty as I know my boyfriend would really want to be there to see his brother get married but will stand by me no matter what even if I tell him not to lol. So it\u2019s a tough decision not to go and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to diffuse the situation but all your input helps relive some stress that I\u2019m not insane lol. And don\u2019t you all worry I\u2019m going to do something amazing for my wonderful sister \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA the invitation said no kids at the wedding, not no kids in mexico.", "NTA. Your child will probably be having blast with their auntie and if a situation arises you could video chat to help out. The couple can not dictate what your sister does with her niece. \n\nI do think the couple does though want their guest to have fun without having to worry about needing to take care of their children or rush to them, but that doesn't warrant their overreaction", "NTA It is really lovely of your sister to do that for you. Like you said, you don\u2019t even have to see your daughter. If and when you do, it will not be on the wedding couple\u2019s time or dime. \n\nThey may be experiencing other people trying to include their children, which isn\u2019t uncommon from what I\u2019ve read on the AITA thread, but they are massively overreacting. I don\u2019t particularly love children, but if it was my wedding, I would appreciate the measures you are taking to follow the adult only agenda while still being able to have your your daughter near.", "NTA... often people want to extend their vacation so this was a fun way to extend it. You are not obligated to spend every moment of a destination wedding at the beck and call of the bride and groom.", "NTA, i this point I\u2019d decline to go to wedding.", "What? NTA\n\nIt's one thing for them not to want any kids at their wedding, but now they don't even want them in the same city or country?\nThat's unreasonable.", "NTA. It\u2019s a good solution.", "NTA\n\nYour solution was absolutely perfect. You also didn't owe the bride and groom any explanations on how your child care is arranged.", "NTA\n\nI am guessing their issue is that they want this destination wedding to be a party for the whole weekend.  Not just the wedding itself, but with everyone hanging out together by the pool throughout the day etc.  So they are upset you are maybe making alternate plans to go hang with your daughter during the day.\n\nFirst of all, you probably will never manage to do that. You are going to find that taxi-ing between hotels is way more effort than it is worth during the middle of the day.  Plus the resorts can be a little difficult about non-resort guests using their facilities. And obviously your daughter won't be visiting you at the adult only resort.  Nor will she be gate crashing the wedding at the ADULTS ONLY resort.  Seriously, do they not know the policies of their own venue??\n\nBut regardless, that's not their decision.  Accepting an invite to their wedding does not mean you have agreed to be their on-call party guest for the whole weekend.  You are not bringing your daughter to their wedding, and they can kick rocks with their thoughts on what you are doing with your kid the rest of the time.", "NTA Skip the wedding and spend the cash on a family vacation with your sister and kid.", "The fact that you are letting your children have a good time during your boyfriend's brother wedding really show where your priorities are.", "NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry. What did I miss? Are kids going to be at the wedding? No. Are kids going to be at the Brides resort? Does the bride have the right to approve of her guests choices for babysitting their own children at their expense? HELL NO! Is the bride paying for everyone to attend said stay so she can dictate exactly how her guests spend their time while at the wedding? No. Is the bride overstepping ? Oh yeah.", "NTA\n\nYour kid will not be present, just near", "Are you sure the bride and groom really want you there? NTA", "NTA of course. I kind of get the concern though. There are so many people who ignore childfree weddings and just do whatever they want anyway, I think she got scared it would happen to her and you took on the bulk of the stress I\u2019m sure she\u2019s under. You know her so if you think this is indicative of who she is, I\u2019d decline to go to the wedding. If you think this was just a stress induced moment of insanity and want to take the heat off I would tell her \u201clook, I get it, people ignore and don\u2019t respect childfree weddings and there are even stories of them getting ruined. I wouldn\u2019t do that to you, I promise my kid won\u2019t be anywhere near the wedding. It seems an insane coincidence but I truly have no intention to undermine your plans. It just happened to work out this way.\u201d If she can\u2019t accept a reasonable explanation, that\u2019s not on you. Hope you guys work it out though, sounds like a fun trip for everyone.\n\nEdit: though you could always go on the trip with your sister and skip the wedding.

Are you planning to spend time with your kids and sister instead of being involved in the wedding? I\u2019m guessing that whole point of adults only is so that it\u2019s a fun and alcohol fuelled week of activities, but they may feel you won\u2019t be attending or will try to bring your kids to things.

You are not trying to insert child into wedding festivities, so it\u2019s really none of their business.", "NTA.\n\nI think your solution for the kids is great. But I wonder why your boyfriends brother and his wife are worried about you bringing your daughter to the same city? You should absolutely stick to your plan and go, so your boyfriend doesn't miss his brothers wedding and you go with him and have your daughter and sister staying at a different hotel and enjoy Mexico.\n\nMaybe the reason you don't know what to do, is because you don't really understand why they got so mad about it? Could you try and contact them and ask them what their concerns are? And just listen actively and mirror their worries (ie \"ah okay, so when I said that my daughter and sister are going two the same city as your wedding, you got really worried that I wouldn't respect your wishes regarding no kids at the wedding? I understand why that would make you worried. How did you worry I would try to let her attend?\"). Don't say your changing your plans. Just try to approach this by trying to really understand why they got so upset - then they'll probably feel heard and validated, and that usually fixes most misunderstandings between (reasonable) adult. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nKind regards,\n\nThe psychologist. \ud83d\ude09", "If that's what they're thinking they also want to control HOW their guests \"have fun.\" Bride and groom are ridiculously controlling.", "Agreed on all counts.

The point of child-free is to not burden others with child care not to force you to not see your kid. If they skip some events to be with their kids then who cares. It IS innocent unless they try to bring the kid into the wedding plans.", "Wedding ceremony, food, bit of a boogie, done.  What other events do they need?  Is there a bedding ceremony?  The showing of the sheets the next morning?  \n\nI think that while it's perfectly reasonable to have a child-free wedding, asking people to not see their child/children for a number of days is unacceptable.  And it's not all about the children missing their parents either, in general parents love their children more than anyone or anything else in the world, and miss them when they're apart.  Asking someone to not see the love(s) of their life for an extended \"Me! Fest\" is pretty shitty.", "Okay, so it\u2019s only a bride/groomzilla issue and not a BF issue as well.

Destination weddings aren\u2019t for just the ceremony- it\u2019s taking a trip with your guests to spend time together, as in parties, excursions, dinners\u2026opting out to spend time with kids will for sure happen. Kids aren\u2019t invited. If Op is able, she should extend a few extra days and have her own family vacay separately.\n\nETA, OP loves the kiddo, and intentions are good, but it\u2019s against the bridal parties\u2019 wishes.
