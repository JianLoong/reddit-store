He\u2019s friends with a few guys and one chick that all went to the same tech school and ended up at the same base as us. \n\nAnyway, a month or two ago my husband invited people over to drink and play board games. He did tell me up front that a woman would be coming too since she\u2019s apart of the group. I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about it at first but she turned out to be really sweet and friendly. We exchanged numbers at the end of the night and I thought I had finally made a friend. (I\u2019m not a very social person which is why hubby invited her in the first place)\n\nThe problem is that she never texts me back, if we have plans she always backs out last minute, but if my hubby texts her for anything (we were in a car accident and she helped him since everyone else was busy and he needed her to drive the rental back to our house after picking up our new car)she reply\u2019s in an instant and jumps at the chance to see him or our son. If we\u2019re ever alone together she just talks about how lucky I am and how she wants to settle down and get married and how she wishes she had someone like him.\n\nThe incident that made me put my foot down happened when our babysitter fell through and I called her three times and she didn\u2019t answer. Hubby messaged her on snap and she replied within a minute and sent him her phone number saying she never answers her Snapchat. I know I probably sound super jealous and controlling but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for a young single woman to give her phone number to a married man.\n\nI told hubby I wasn\u2019t comfortable with her coming over or hanging around him anymore and he accepted it before I was even able to give an explanation for my feelings. I\u2019m just worried I\u2019m coming off as controlling and jealous. I don\u2019t mind him being friendly with women, I just feel like she\u2019s acting very sketchy.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I accept that I shouldn\u2019t have gotten so worked up about her giving him her phone number. I have no problem nor have I ever gotten on him in the past about him having the number of any other woman (coworker or friend). I know getting upset about that part makes me an AH. To be clear though, I never got upset at HIM for this. I even saved the number to his phone for him since we was driving and might need it for work.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019ve read most of the reply\u2019s and I feel like I left out some details. 1) I wasn\u2019t upset that she was coming over but more about the fact that my house and myself were both a mess since our stuff had just been delivered. I understand that\u2019s a me issue and I treated her the way I would treat any other guest. Honestly I was more annoyed at him than anyone else because he doesn\u2019t like that I keep to myself rather than try to make friends in a place we could be leaving at a moments notice and told me it would be good for me to have another woman to talk to. 2) I\u2019m adding this because I\u2019m really tired of typing it, I KNOW I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE PHONE NUMBER. He has other women\u2019s numbers and I have other men\u2019s numbers and neither of us have a problem with it. I was already upset about the other stuff and overreacted regarding the phone number. 3) I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m not entitled to her friendship or having her babysit for us. That being said, she\u2019s asked me to do things with her but when I text her to confirm she cancels or outright ignores me. The reason we asked her to babysit was because she had offered to if our previous arrangement fell through. 4) my husband didn\u2019t \u201cwarn\u201d me that another woman was coming over, I asked him who all he invited and she was part of the list of names. 5) all the people saying that she\u2019s his friend and not mine are exactly right, however I think you guys are assuming they\u2019re super close and I\u2019m trying to come between them. After I voiced my discomfort he told me that they aren\u2019t actually friends and just friendly because they work together and are apart of the same group. 6) she invited herself to the game night and told my husband that she wanted to meet me and be friends which is why I made the assumption she wanted to be friends with me.", "created_utc": 1667840549, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yot5tq/aita_for_not_allowing_my_husbands_female_coworker/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good on your husband for not questioning said boundaries!", "NTA-you have a right to say who is in your home. However, as a female in the military, I get really annoyed when my friends or coworkers try to pawn me off to be friends with their wives. She may have thought they were friends and all the sudden he's trying to push her onto his wife. I've been there and it sucks. Also, if they are in the same unit they have access to each other's phone numbers on their recall rosters, so her giving it to him, he already would have had it on the paper or his computer.", "Nta. She's giving you a very valid reason to question her intentions and behaviour.

I'm an engaged woman, and if my (male) partner said that some of his friends from work were coming over, I would find it almost insulting if he felt the need to give me a warning because one of them was a woman. You've got to cut that out. I'm 29, are you in your early 20's? Does he have a history of being dishonest, or of cheating? \n\nAlso, she's not a rando at a bar, they're co-workers. What's the harm in sharing a phone number if they have an established working relationship and friendship? \n\nHer behavior is strange, though. Even if this was a male co-worker, it's disrespectful to ignore you, and I wouldn't like it. Her mentioning that she wishes she had a partner like yours would make me uncomfortable, as well, even if it was coming from a man. Based on this, you are warranted in asking your husband to not have her around anymore.\n\nNTA.", "YTA, the fact that you have an issue with his COWORKER having his number speaks volumes about the true issue here. You need to get your jealousy under control.", "YTA.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with the other comments on this post egging on this sexism and insecurity.  For context, I'm a woman who has been in the military for 15 years.  \n\nI care about my fellow Soldiers.  I want to help them.  I can appreciate when my coworkers are good spouses and parents.  I am responsive to my fellow Soldiers when they contact me or need things, not only because it is good for the unit to be reliably helpful but because I have a shared history with other servicemembers and that makes me want to help them.  \n\nI haven't got the slightest interest in my (mostly male) coworkers' (mostly) wives beyond how it impacts my coworkers' wellbeing.  I make polite conversation with the wives but for the most part have nothing in common with them (at least, no more in common with a SAHM than any of the other guys do).  I certainly wouldn't answer a phone call from one of the wives who I only gave my number to because she happens to be the wife of a coworker.  If my coworker messaged me asking for help, I would respond immediately.  \n\nThe sexism associated with assuming that every female military servicemember is out to steal your husband is a lazy thought process.  She talks to you about your husband because knowing him is probably the only thing you two actually have in common, and if you put a tiny bit of thought into it, you'd probably find that it's all you really have to say to her.  Also, your husband is probably not Matt Damon, so not sure why you'd think another woman is out to steal him.  \n\nYou're going to undermine this unit and the camaraderie she has with her peers because you're insecure.  It is women like you that set us back.", "NTA\n\nLots of sketchy behavior on her part. Even if she doesn't have a crush on your husband...what, is she just rude to you? It doesn't make much sense.", "**YTA**\n\nYour entire source of resentment is that you assumed that because a woman in your husband's unit was a woman that she should be YOUR friend, and when she didn't want to be, and wanted to continue to be friends with her colleague, JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER GUYS SHE WORKS WITH, who you take for granted will be friends with him because they have penises, you (and apparently 99% of the respondents on this post) assume that she's trying to get into your husband's pants or doing something inappropriate . . . except there's literally no indication of that.\n\nShe responds to your husband's messages and not to yours because, as someone else noted, she is HIS FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. Not yours. And frankly, I wouldn't want to be friends with you either, if I were a woman in the military who is already dealing with sexism and trying to hold down my own every day, and was then faced with the creepy wife of one of my colleagues who demands that on top of everything else I adhere to her weirdly dictatorial ideas about gender roles and how I'm supposed to interact with people.  I'd be running in the other direction. \n\nJust because you have similar genitalia doesn't mean that she has any interests in common with you. It doesn't mean that she cares about the same things or wants to hang out with you. She is in the same career field as your husband, and like his other colleagues, she has interests in common with him. They are FRIENDS. That you're seeing more than that speaks to YOUR insecurities, jealousy, and sexism. Get your own friends, and stop assuming that society needs to divide itself up by gender. It's gross. YTA.", "NTA- She is not your friend. She is playing nice with you to get close to your husband.  She doesn\u2019t return communications. She cancels plans with you.  But when hubby contacts her she drops everything.  Could she be more transparent?  \n\nEveryone has their own set of boundaries. Mine is you treat me like crap, you are out.  Your husband agrees with you because either she has been inappropriate or he sees that she treats you poorly or both.  Do not try to be the cool wife.  Do not try to continue the friendship.  You don\u2019t have to invite her over or engage.  If someone treated my H like she has been treating you, I would distance myself from that person.  No one should let a work colleague or friend treat their SO like this.  You and H keep up the communication and stay on the same page.", "So a few thoughts. I dont think you're the AH but try to see this in a different way possibly? I work with all men. I am the first woman to ever last at this job and probably the only one for a long time. I am always friendly and sociable with my co workers spouses and partners when we have get togethers and have given my number to them. I've been in a similar position myself where the SAHM thinks we are girl buddies now and has tons of time to blow up my phone with mundane stuff I don't have time for. It's very hard to be a woman in a male only environment and it takes 2x the work to prove yourself. I didn't do all that to be lumped in with the housewives and girlfriends who text each other memes waiting for their partners to come home.(not that YOU do that this is just my experience)  I wouldn't appreciate a co workers spouse messaging me asking for favors and babysitting like I'm not literally just as busy as their partners are doing the same thing. I think it would have been better to actually try to lay a groundwork of friendship before asking favors and it might have been met in a better way but anyways it's done now. Moving forward not everyone who is being pleasant wants to be buddies and it's a awkward situation for her too being messaged by a spouse and just feels super awkward and weird to the person on the receiving end. I always answer my co workers messages as soon as I get them because it's work even if the message isn't always work related but if i have limited time or energy the \"hey what are you doing this weekend\" texts can wait. My way too long (sorry) point of all this is try not to read too much into it, go with your gut and what makes you comfortable but I don't think there was anything malicious here I think she just doesn't want to be buddies and that's ok! Try not to stress. I've been accused by angry partners of co workers of flirting or wanting their man but trust me you work with these assholes long enough and nothing they do is attractive to you eventually lol", "NTA, gotta be honest i think your instincts are spot on. I wonder if she is also quick to respond to the other guys or if its just your husband?", ">He did tell me up front that a woman would be coming too since she\u2019s apart of the group. I wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about it at first \n\nI think you need to look at why any woman your husband is friends with automatically starts as a potential threat in your mind. Those aren't healthy boundaries.\n\nThat said, this woman is acting mildly sketchy or rude. The ONLY seriously questionable thing I see here is her saying she wants a man like your husband. Other than that, I see someone who's not interested in being your friend, but is your husband's friend. \n\nIf you now don't want to be her friend that's fine, but I'm iffy on barring your husband from being her friend. Would you expect any of his male work friends to respond immediately when you called? Or to make friends with you? And if not, why are you treating his female work friend like this?\n\nMild ESH", "Nta. While I think that men and women should have friends of the opposite sex I definitely think you should avoid people who disrespect your relationship. If she makes you uncomfortable then that's that. Also if your husband is in agreement then she probably makes him uncomfortable too.", "NTA but i do not think her giving her phone number to your hubby is sketchy. \n\nWhat is sketchy is how she treats you versus how she treats your husband. I am glad your husband supports you.", "YTA. The only thng it seems this woman is guilty of is not wanting to be your friend. She might have a crush on your husband, she might not, but has she acted in any way inappropriate with him?

She also gets to decide if she wants to be friends with you and/or your husband. Sounds like she likes your husband but not you.

She\u2019s under no obligation to answer the phone calls or social invitations of the wife of a coworker over her co-worker. \n\nThis whole thing just reeks of insecurity and outdated views on gender roles.\n\nESH", "I realize how that sounded, when I said he told me up front I meant he mentioned her when I asked who all was coming over. Sorry!", "How is telling my husband that I don\u2019t want one woman he\u2019s known for less than a year and isn\u2019t even close with in my home undermining his unit?", "Maybe slightly sketchy, but IDK. \n\nThe woman is essentially the husband's coworker it seems. I think it is reasonable to be more responsive willing to help your coworker versus their partner, I think this applies no matter the gender. \n\nI get that OP/husband thought they could become friends, but it didn't happen. It comes off a little OP is a woman, she is a woman of course you should be friends, you have sooo much in common already. \n\nNot to say partners can't every text coworkers, but I would expect 99% of the time if my coworkers family unit needs help the request would come from my coworker not their partner.", "Thank you! He\u2019s been very good at respecting my boundaries about this", "Thank you for helping me view this from the other side! While I\u2019m still not comfortable with her coming over I do think that I may have come off as pushy. I tried very hard not to be but I can see what you mean. As for the babysitting, I ONLY asked her because she had offered to babysit for that very weekend and when I told her we had one lined up she told me to call her if it fell through. I know I\u2019m absolutely not entitled to her time especially since she would be doing me a favor, what irked me was that she had offered and then didn\u2019t answer until my husband asked. Thank you again!", "Yes, your observations are the same as mine. Just because this person was a woman OP wanted to be friends with her, as she said she has no friends at this location. This woman was clearly not interested in that and this line of thinking was perhaps a bit presumptuous. This female coworker comes through as inappropriate but we are missing context here. Would she do the same favor to the other guys in this friend group? If yes, she's just being a good friend of OP's husband without any angle. If these favors are reserved only for OP's husband, then she has more going on, and that would indeed be inappropriate. Nonetheless, OP comes through as super insecure.\nESH except for the husband.", "I agree with this completely. My response would of been similar, just less articulate.", "I'm sure the male coworkers don't outright ignore OP if she does reach out to them. The friend doesn't have to be buddies with OP, but  you should be showing basic respect to your friend's spouse, outright and obvious ignoring is disrespectful and rude.", "I didn\u2019t ask him to ignore her, I just don\u2019t want her in my home anymore.", "As I said in a previous reply, I do think I overreacted about the phone number. I know he has other women\u2019s numbers (work and old friends) and that doesn\u2019t bother me. It was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me and I ended up blowing that part out of proportion. I will accept that I was an AH for getting upset about that.", "Why is that not okay? She was the husband's friend to begin with.", "I\u2019m sorry if my use of \u201cchick\u201d came off that way, honestly I use it all the time just as a synonym for \u201cwoman\u201d I refer to myself as one. And I know I\u2019m not entitled to her friendship, really I couldn\u2019t care less if she likes me or not. But is it too much for me to expect a certain amount of respect in my own house? I don\u2019t care if he talks to her at work or messages him in their group chat and I\u2019ve already made an edit to say that I know I overreacted about the phone number. The way she talks about and acts around my husband makes me uncomfortable so I just don\u2019t want her in my house again", "This seems like quite the leap. Maybe female soldier doesn't want SAHM friend bc she views herself as \"one of the guys\" and so prioritizes the other people in her unit.", "My husband only had her snap because he\u2019s part of a work group chat on it and he just tends to add everyone. I have no reason to not trust him in this situation", "He understands and respects my decision. After I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable around her he told me that he doesn\u2019t even think of her as a friend and actually thinks she\u2019s annoying", "He does have friends of the opposite sex and I have no problems with any of them, just this one. I have guy friends myself but I would stop talking to them in a heartbeat if my husband said they make him uncomfortable", "I only called her because after she dropped off the car we were waiting for my husband came home so one of us could drop her at the dorms and I mentioned we were going out that weekend. She asked if we needed a sitter and that she would love to watch our son as she loves babies and I said we already had one set up. She insisted (like, told me multiple times) to call her if our arrangement fell through. I would never ask a random coworker of my husband to come watch my kid last minute.", "I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t be friendly to her or talk to her or even text her. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with her in my home", "He has her snap because they were both added to a work group chat. I already admitted to blowing the phone number thing out of the water and I see how it\u2019s a silly thing to be upset about when everyone has access to everyone else\u2019s numbers at work.", "Nah, this man can\u2019t lie to save his life. If anything was going on I\u2019d definitely know. We have the same password for our phones, share our locations at all times, ect. He\u2019s also SUPER lazy and doesn\u2019t want to leave the house unless it\u2019s to run an errand with me lol", "This assumes that OP has done nothing to make the coworker uncomfortable or wary of answering her. I'm not saying that's the case here, but there are definitely spouses of friends/coworkers that I choose not to interact with because of their behavior. I'm not rude to them during face to face interactions, but I don't engage with them outside of that.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I'm not saying this is the case in this situation, only that there are definitely scenarios where not interacting/answering the spouse of a friend/coworker isn't rude or inappropriate. It depends entirely on context.", "This. It's the military. She wants to be seen as part of the unit/service, not one of the spouses. Take any perceived issue with gender roles here and amp them up about three notches.", "These are some pretty solid points. At the same time, though, it seems like she is regularly and actively ignoring OP, no matter what the situation is. I'd definitely feel not-great if any of my partner's friends actively avoided me but were there in a heartbeat for my partner (regardless of gender.) Just feels kind of like the friend can accept him but not his partner-- would you really want a friend that would treat your significant other in that way? Just doesn't seem worth it.", "I'd agree with your take if she wasn't clearly jumping to the OPs husband's messages/texts instantly while ignoring the partner \u00f2f a friend reaching out about the exact same thing.\n\nThe coworker doesn't have to be friends with her colleague's spouses, but she should still be polite and respectful of the spouse  and not openly and blantantly rude. \n\nShe doesn't owe a response to her coworkers wife. But when you completely ignore the spouse and jump to respond to the coworker that's pretty ridiculous to think OP is the one being wrong in this.", "But then you said you weren't thrilled about it...so what made you not thrilled?", "Ahh, I gotcha. Still, there are other parts of your post that tell me that you have some internal stuff that you've got to resolve. It's important to be able to sniff out sketchy behavior, but try not to see other women as competition, we've got to stick together. \u2764\ufe0f", "Don't say sorry! Your guts told you something was going wrong and you're right.", "Well, she did give OP her phone number, which seems to have been for nothing. \n\nThe fact that she ignored OP about babysitting and then immediately responded to OP's husband is sketch. They're married, she would still be helping him out by babysitting regardless of who asked her. \n\nI was in the military. My family was in the military. Coworkers dating is pretty common. Disregard for marriage is also common. I would tell OP to trust her gut.", "Can I ask you why you contacted her by snap when you have her phone number?", "Oh for sure if you are uncomfortable there doesn't really need to be a reason other than you are uncomfortable. You have to do what you think is best for your marriage no judgment there. I've just been on that side before and it was really frustrating especially with the accusations or threats that I wanted their man. Like no I absolutely do not that man throws firecrackers under the bathroom door at me I don't see him as potential at all after 2 straight weeks of a bunch of grown men getting a hold of fart spray and laughing like toddler idiots lol", "I suspect the woman is dodging OP because OP has repeatedly been trying to be friends and she just isn't interested. It doesn't have to be anything nefarious with the husband for this communication pattern - she just doesn't want to be friends with OP and OP has been pushing for it.", "Fair point, but if he invites friends from work over you shouldn't single her out as being uninvited. It just seems like your singling her out because she's a girl and doesn't have any interest in friendship with you.", "Because you treat your friends spouse with basic human decency and respect. You don't ignore them anytime they contact you. It's fine to not jump to respond every time OP reaches out, but outright ignoring her when she's clearly close to her phone to respond instantly to the husband is unusual behavior.", "Sexism", "Thats what I was thinking. She had to work hard to prove herself and sees it as hurtful or maybe just plain not interested in being lumped in with the dependants", "The husband-stealing bit was sarcastic, but what remains is this:\n\nIt makes zero sense that a person would respond immediately to a snapchat to say \"here's my number because I never look at snapchat.\"\n\nClearly the Unit communicates on snapchat, which is why he used it to contact her, and did not have or need her number.  And vice versa.", "Your a good wife. You trust your husband. \n Being a military wife is hard. My niece has been doing it for 10 years and 3 kids. You get uprooted alot and deal with a mixed bag of people.   Hang in there.", "I definitely wasn\u2019t placing blame for you getting upset about the phone number because sometimes in the heat of the moment, we as people, take things to heart. Thank you for clarifying though. I definitely agree with a lot of these comments. You are NTA. You have a valid reason to feel the way you do, and I\u2019m happy that he didn\u2019t question your decision.", "That\u2019s the reason I went with ESH\u2026 and piggybacked your post, because you made very valid points that I didn\u2019t just want to repeat myself in a separate post. \n\nThe military is a traditionally male dominated vocation and as a woman who has worked in a male dominated industry, I\u2019ve been there\u2026 wanting to be treated as an equal colleague both on and off the clock, but always having to deal with being clustered in with the wives- who I felt little commonality with. \n\nI do not think the female coworker handled it well at all, but it is just an unfair dynamic to begin with.", "Which is why I went with ESH, because OP is definitely not in the right either.", "That was mostly my own insecurities about the state of my house and my own appearance. This might come off as sexist but I feel like women expect a higher level of cleanliness than men do. TMO had delivered our furniture and things just a couple days prior and not everything was put away, organized, or wiped down. I had also spent my entire day trying to figure out where everything should go so I hadn\u2019t yet showered or really gotten dressed. I realize now that this is a pretty significant detail that I left out. I was afraid of making the post too long but I\u2019ll add another edit.", ">Well, she did give OP her phone number, which seems to have been for nothing. \n\nIt really depends on how that went down. If OP was the one to initiate the number swap, it puts the coworker in a very awkward position. \n\n>The fact that she ignored OP about babysitting and then immediately responded to OP's husband is sketch. They're married, she would still be helping him out by babysitting regardless of who asked her. \n\nI don't generally answer my phone when someone I'm not interested in talking to calls me. It's not clear the coworker knew *why* OP was calling her. If hubby texted and said \"hey, I'm trying to find someone to babysit my kid\", now the coworker has context. \n\n>I was in the military. My family was in the military. Coworkers dating is pretty common. Disregard for marriage is also common. I would tell OP to trust her gut.\n\nCoworkers dating a married coworker was less common than married coworkers dating a dependent or civilian. OPs husband seems to be respecting his wife's concerns (which is good), but that doesn't mean they're valid. The military wives who treat all female service members as if they're just waiting to pounce on their husband just add to the sexism faced by women in the military.

She no doubt senses this, and I can tell you from experience, it's an awkward place to be. Do you regularly text his male coworkers? Would you be as offended if one of his male coworkers kept you at arm's length? Maybe you're right, and she is sus, but you should also be aware that you started off treating her very differently simply because she's a woman, and that's going to influence how she perceives you and how open she is to interacting with you. If your husband feels she's acted inappropriately towards him, it's great he's setting boundaries. It shows you don't really have anything to worry about. Affairs happen because a partner chooses to be unfaithful, not because someone comes and tempts your other faithful partner into an affair.", "OP, I mean no disrespect, because it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re admitting to your faults (which speak a lot to your character) and you are actively trying to protect your marriage. \n\nHave you considered that the female co-worker may have set this hard boundary for herself because she hates being lumped in with the wives instead of being treated equally as a co-worker? \n\nHe lack of communication about this isn\u2019t excusable, but perhaps this could be the root of the issue. Perhaps a frank conversation is in order, even if that means you might have to hear her say she has no issues with you, she just doesn\u2019t see a close friendship happening between the 2 of you.", "Mmmm that's sexist. Do you have male friends?", "I see, after going back and rereading it I see where I got confused. My apologies.", "Yes it does. You don't have to be friends with your friends partners but if they reach out to you in an emergency after and accident you damn well don't ignore them. If a friend's partner reaches out to make plans, you don't make plans with them only to back out last minute, you don't agree to plans, period. You can set boundaries with a friend's partner without being an asshole, but ignoring them, ditching plans you make with them are not the way to do so or be respectful of your friend's marriage.", "I agree"]}
