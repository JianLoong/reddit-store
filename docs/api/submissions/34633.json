I have been super stressed lately. And as much as I love my Mom, she has been a huge pain about all of it. Everything is handled, but my mom has been constantly by my side these past few months, insisting to know about EVERY. LITTLE. DETAIL, and criticizing every choice I made, insisting I could get something better for cheaper, effectively stressing me out more. I\u2019ve tried telling her she\u2019s not helping,but she insists she is (she\u2019s not) and that if it wasn\u2019t for her I would be way more behind (I cannot emphasize how little my mother has done).\n\nThe final straw came a couple days ago. My step-sister (who we will call Avery, 22F) used to date one of my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s younger cousins. They dated for over 2 years. It ended horribly a couple weeks ago. She quietly approached me and asked if it would be okay if she did not come to the wedding. Avery loved him with all her heart, and I could tell she was still hurting a lot over it. It would have sent her over the edge to go to a wedding where he would be there, especially when rumor has it he was going to propose. Me and Avery had never been close, and although I wanted her there, it would not have been in her interest to come. \n\nBut once my mother heard, it was hell. In front of me, my mother yelled at Avery over the phone, calling her an ungreatful b**** and saying she never could support me.  She started criticizing her and demanding she come to the wedding. I literally had to wrestle the phone from her. I yelled at her, saying this was MY wedding and how dare she talk down that way to her own step-daughter, who was hurting so much. My mother said she couldn\u2019t believe I was taking her side, and continued to call my sister names. I very plainly told her that if she could not respect my sister, she would be uninvited to my wedding. She blew up at me, saying that she was the reason this wedding was happening, and I was ungreatful.\n\nThinking about it, I feel bad. My step father has called me, asking me what happened. I told him. A while later, he texted to say my mother was in a fit, and he talked to her about what she had said, and she was planning on apologizing. He basically begged me to let her come to my wedding, that she was acting crazy over not going.\n\nBut what should I do? How will she react if I don\u2019t let her? Would I be in the wrong here?\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\n\nI asked Avery if she would feel more comfortable if we didn\u2019t invite my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin. She said she doesn\u2019t want to come at all, she doesn\u2019t feel ready to go to a wedding, even if he isn\u2019t there. She knows his family very closely and said she can\u2019t handle facing any of them yet.  She was cheated on, and they had a harsh breakup, so I can understand why.\n\nMe and my Fianc\u00e9e are paying for EVERYTHING. We are even paying to fly some extended family out, and bought my mom her MOTB dress. She isn\u2019t spending a dime.\n\n", "created_utc": 1704750184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191wyme/wibta_if_i_didnt_invite_my_mom_to_my_wedding/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother is stressing you out, making this all about her, and behaved hideously to your stepsister. She needs a timeout. I almost laughed over \u201csaying she was the reason this wedding was happening:\u201d um, it\u2019s happening because you met the love of your life, no?\n\nPoor Avery. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be up for a wedding either after that, especially with ex\u2019s family. Good on you for being understanding.", "NTA. \n\nFirst thing, call all your vendors and get your stuff password protected. Regardless of what happens with inviting your mom to the wedding, she is clearly unwell and lashing out, and so you need to make sure she doesn't mess with anything. EVERY vendor needs to know that only you/your fiance can make changes, that there may be an issue, and they need to lock down the services so she doesn't change anything. Take that same energy in making sure your dress is safe from her, and your home is safe from her (if she has a key, time to get it back or change the locks). \n\nNext, think about the things you have compromised on for the wedding that you aren't happy with, and if there is time to change it. If there is and you can, go change it- change those flowers to roses, get the votive candles, whatever- and forget making your mom happy. \n\nThen, and only then, have a conversation with your mother. Take a few days and just think and decide what you want to do. And when you do talk to her, if there is any chance you want her at the wedding, be clear that not only is what she said/did to your stepsister absolutely inexcusable, but she has now demonstrated a lack of care and self control that you worry will happen ON your wedding day. She didn't care about your feelings, she certainly didn't care about your stepsister, and she couldn't be reasoned with. Why would you want her around on your big day where she may cause a scene? And even if she doesn't cause a scene, she has put you down at every turn, so how will your wedding day be any different?\n\nBefore you sit down and ask her those questions, you should answer them yourself. Do you even want her there?", "NTA I\u2019m always down for un-inviting a meddling mom who needs to be put in her place!", "NTA- you can have anyone you want at your wedding. Probably makes everything better to cut the toxic people out. Unless your parents are paying for it. Then I dunno", ">She was cheated on, and they had a harsh breakup, so I can understand why.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e's cousin cheated? \n\nI'd revoke his invite. I'd not push Avery to attend as she's clearly not up for it, but I'd boot the cheater who broke my sister's heart from the event. If he can't be faithful, I'm not paying for his plate. \n\nTalk it out with your mom. In a few years you'd regret not having her there.", "NTA for not inviting / uninviting her; her behavior is atrocious. That said, I don't think it's going to end the drama, as she doesn't sound like a person who's just going to back down from this, and you'll have to hear everyone under the sun's (or at least your family and your fiance's family) opinions about it.", "NTA, but if you do decide to invite your mom assign several people (bridesmaids, your step dad, etc) to run interference and keep your mom busy so you you can just enjoy your day.", "NTA\n\nINFO: Is she paying for the wedding?", "I don't know, NTA obviously, because your mother crossed this line one too may times but it may cause more harm than good. I think your mother is too involved in your wedding planning. Her interference with the private conversation you were having with your stepsister and decision to berate and insult your her was inexcusable, unkind and outrageous. However making the decision to rescind your mother's invitation to the wedding in the heat of the moment is a jerk reaction.\n\nAt a minimum your mother owes your stepsister a grovelling apology. If you decide not to rescind the invitation, you need to lay down some ground rules. You need to let her know you will not tolerate any further interference or meddling in your wedding plans or with your guests.", "NTA - I wouldn't even blame you if you wanted to go low or no contact with your mom and her  out of control behavior.", "NTA - you\u2019re obviously not the AH but I\u2019m guessing disinviting her really will not help this situation in any way.", "INFO\n\n> It ended horribly a couple weeks ago.\n\n> Avery loved him with all her heart, and I could tell she was still hurting a lot over it.\n\nDo you know what happened? Would you characterize the cousin as being in the wrong?\n\nBecause, NGL: why not just uninvite the cousin? Step-siblings are closer family than cousins, after all.", "Mom is an AH, BUT if you bar her from your wedding, this is BIG-TIME action that everyone will know about, and won't be forgotten, i.e. permanent damage, not only with mom but others wondering about you and creating long-time family divisions.", "It\u2019s more complicated than just AH or not.  The real problem is that uninviting her is going to solve nothing. I think that it might be healthy to sit down with everyone involved and have a decent conversation. Set some boundaries and as long as your mom can respect the boundaries and your stepdad will basically be there, making sure that she does hopefully Then it might be better on everyone to invite her. I realize she\u2019s not making anything fun for you and potentially ruining most of what should be an enjoyable time for you and for that I am sorry you\u2019re dealing with it.  But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to ban her from the wedding. I did have the same question as other people did about why not uninvite the cousin instead of your stepsister? But it\u2019s really none of my business. I think it\u2019s very good of you to not be upset that your stepsister doesn\u2019t want to come and you seem like a logical human being. Your mom sounds like a train wreck.", "YWBTA - to yourself. \n\nUninviting your mother will do nothing to alleviate the drama your mother is creating. \n\nIf anything, it will likely make it much worse. \n\nYou're gonna get people who tell you that \"it's your wedding/do what you want/it's good to cut toxic people out of your life, etc.\" \n\nBut unless you're ready to walk away from your mother forever (and any other family members who side with her), I think ya gotta invite her.", "If you don't let her after her apology and letting your cousin not attend- YWBTA.\n\nOtherwise, NTA.", "NTA.

If that (and butting out) is done, then letting her come might avoid a permanent headache, because she certainly won\u2019t ever forgive not being there. It\u2019ll become a constant issue in the future, so finding a way will prevent a lot of drama.  \n\nIF she apologizes and keeps her opinions behind her teeth, that is.", "YWBTA if your mom apologizes to you and your step-sis and agrees to back off of the planning and you still didn't let her attend.", "YTA if you follow through.

Just promise yourself: never cave and appologize about defending your boundaries. Getting uninvited has been her decision, not yours. She could have conducted herself in a supporting role whatever you did. She choose not to. Actions have consequences. Again, her decision, not yours. \n\nYour mother is not conducting in acceptable behaviour, so don't accept it. I've cut people out of my life for much, much less than what your mother is doing.

You sound very empathetic to her situation like a good step sister.\n\nYour mother on the other hand sounds like a wicked stepmother. Also it sounds like you need to set some boundaries generally with your mother.\n\n\nJust a thought- you could even it out and your fianc\u00e9 tell his cousin that given the way he treated your step sister, he shouldn\u2019t come to the wedding. His values aren\u2019t consistent with the entire point of the wedding.

I wouldn\u2019t blame you for not inviting her, hell I might even encourage it to be honest. She\u2019s constantly stressing you out and delaying your wedding planning all because she wants to control and criticise everything you do for this wedding so she can have what she wants and likes.

She'll never forget or forgive and will lash out at you for the rest of your life. *THEN* there's the flying monkeys.\n\nMy advice: cut off the info train. If she isn't paying, she hasn't a say. If all she does is complain and try to boss, she needs a virtual piece of tape across her mouth. \n\nThen, get together with as many people as you can and appoint them as minders.
