Since Cal was little, she's had an extreme fear of bugs. This could be because she got stung by honeybees twice while playing in a garden, and once a wasp entered her swimsuit that she left outside and she put it on without checking, so you can guess what happened. Anyway, we all know how much she hates bugs so we all kind of shield her if a bug is near (ETA: we did this more when she had been recently bitten, we knew this couldn't go on forever so we got her into therapy for a bit and while she can walk past most bugs alright now, she may get tensed up), I know this cannot go on forever and we are slowly working on making her less bothered by their presence because if you panic, a bug is more likely to attack.\n\nOn to what happened: our landlord's daughter is getting married soon so the entire building is decorated with lights and lamps, and they attract a lot of bugs. Cal is no longer afraid of the smaller ones and we keep our doors and windows closed so the big ones don't get in, but last night, a really big, brown grasshopper like bug entered from somewhere and was in the living room. Cal had to get something from there so she just stood at the entrance before calling for her dad to remove the bug. I was in the kitchen and thought nothing of it, until I heard my husband talking aggressively and assertively. I went to check, and Cal was almost in tears as my husband was forcing her to walk across the room, past the bug, to get what she needed.\n\nHe was scolding her the entire time, asking her to grow up and that he was tired of helping her like she was a baby. I'm not gonna lie it really pissed me off so I asked my husband to leave, shooed the bug away then got Cal what she needed. She looked really upset so I consoled her before she went back to her room.\n\nI was really angry at my husband so I yelled at him that the way he treated Cal was very cruel, to which he yelled back that he was just trying to make her get rid of her fear because she's an adult and needs to act like it. I told him that terrifying her by scolding and forcibly making her cross a bug isn't the right way to make her get rid of her fear and he told me that I was the reason my daughters were so spoiled (they're NOT, I know it may sound like I'm saying this because I'm their mom but they're literally the most soft spoken, down to earth girls ever. The reason my husband thinks they're spoiled is because he's super controlling and my daughters went to the movies last week with their friends.) I'm so done with this man but could he have been right? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: The bug was grasshopper like (in appearance) not a grasshopper. I don't know the english term for this insect but they are super fast and tend to climb up the person walking past them thats why she was so afraid. My daughter can walk past, or remove most bugs alright but she's still not comfortable with them touching or climbing on her thats why she called my husband this one time, also the first time in years she's called for help against a bug like this.\n\nEdit 2: She developed it at 12 and yes she had been in therapy and she's made great progress so far though the therapist said the phobia may never be cured; she could only learn to suppress it. We were also told that pushing her to overcome her fear may make it worse - the reason why I was so pissed at my husband.\n\nEdit 3: My husband is abusive but 'Just leave' is not an option for everyone.

I can take care of bugs when I'm alone after psyching myself up... but if there's someone else around who isn't scared of bugs, then I ask for help.

The only way your daughter will learn that those kinds of bugs aren't so bad, is seriously only something she can figure out on her own. That or seek some counseling/therapy if it's really bothering your husband so badly. But if he's not going to pay for therapy and help your daughter the appropriate way. He shouldn't be snapping at his kids that way.  \n\n\n  \nNext time he yells at you the same way ask him \"what are you trying to get rid of from me?\" see the look on his face.", "NTA ,but you're overprotective and your husband is too harsh.

Even if one were to presume your husband had the best of intentions in wanting Cal to overcome a limitation and evolve, that is not the way to do it.

Respectfully, I wonder, could it perhaps be time to consider a different therapist, or a different change work modality? What I read in your second edit sounds to me like the therapist (most likely from good intentions) is imposing a limitation on Cal that might not need to be present, by saying that a (her) phobia may never be cured. Hypnotherapy, for example, has been demonstrated to have positive effect on resolving phobias (lots of results on Google Scholar); my mentor resolved a *very* severe snake phobia in one session. He took the client from being on the verge of passing out at the mention of the word to having her photo taken holding a snake within, I believe, a week of the session.\n\n(Edited to add: This comment is in no way meant as a slam against talk therapy or this therapist in particular; s/he is obviously effective having gotten Cal to where she is at this point.

She used to keep a Yeti cup on the nightstand, with a plastic straw like you can get at a fast food place. One night, she woke up thirsty, took a big drink, and couldn't get any out! She tends to stick lemons, ice, whatever in there, so she assumed it was that, and slurped real hard, and got a palmetto in her mouth. Needless to say, she doesn't use those kinds of cups, anymore. Only ones that are fully closed lmao", "For some reason I loved the huge roaches when I was in South America. The little ones here are way creepier, the big ones I found neat. It's those black long bugs that like to hang out in basements with way too many legs for me, I'm that weirdo who thinks snakes and spiders are adorable but those things appear and I'll barricade the room they're in until my bf murders them.", "I used to live in corpus Christi Texas for 4.5 years. They have cockroaches the size of a open hand...that fly. Try stepping on them you foot moves with it.. didn't smush it but I tried. Strong scary suckers. They also have grasshoppers that look like peapods. Moved to Idaho for a bit they had black jumping spiders lots of them. And ladybugs who try to hit a person. Never seen so many of them before.  I'm sure I looked like a fool screaming and trying to get them off me.  So op don't let him destroy all of your hard work on helping her get over her fear. Show her that you are there for her and that her fear is nothing to be ashamed of. And she will get better in time because of love and understanding. Huggss to you guys. Leave the loser.", "Phobias are incredibly irrational. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re stupid or childish. That just means they have no logical basis. Our brain just decides to go apeshit when we see or experience our phobia. \n\nI\u2019m terrified of sharks. And not in the normal way most people are. I can\u2019t look at photos of them without wanting to throw up. Especially great white sharks. I\u2019ve had this fear since I was a baby. I had a meltdown at SeaWorld when I just saw a shark in a tank. It couldn\u2019t hurt me but the sight of it sent me into a panic. Also, when I\u2019m in a body of water that I cannot touch the bottom of (usually pools), I am immediately convinced there\u2019s a shark in the water with me. Logically, I know there\u2019s no shark. I can see there\u2019s no shark, but my imagination convinces me otherwise. I don\u2019t get in water much anymore.", "I get the absolute, irrational certainty that I'm going to die if I have to go in water, but I still the objective knowledge that it's very unlikely. So if the alternative is KNOWING that I'll die if I don't, I'll go in. I think you underestimate people's capacity to overcome their fear in a true emergency. I've jumped in a pool to get my niece who snuck in without any floatation device. I was an absolute mess afterwards but I did it with no hesitation.", "Eurgh my math teacher that year that I lived in Texas had a very similar story about a thermos of milk. (shudder)", " It's not something you force. It sounds like you've been taking things slow with Cal and letting her get over her fear in baby steps, which is probably the right thing to do.", "yeah zillions of legs = always a dealbreaker lol\n\nI'm actually a country person and very OK with bugs normally (and I'm with you on the snakes! I built a snake-friendly brush pile in the garden and I know they live there 'cause there's less mouse damage on my sweet potatoes now), but I won't touch our super-leggy ones either.", "That's a no for me on Idaho then lol. Pictures of jumping spiders are cute, the reality feels like it would be different.", "I had a wolf spider run at me once after I sprayed it, luckily there was a shoe in between us. Not the good kind of core memory but there was a sense of satisfaction when he smacked into that shoe.", "Me too!  I have an insane phobia of sharks being in the water with me!!!!  \n\nI won\u2019t (CAN\u201dT) be in a pool alone because I get panicky that a sharks is in there with me, even thought logically I know sharks couldn\u2019t survive in chlorinated water.  I won\u2019t go very far in the lake here for the same reason, even though I\u2019m in the Midwest so sharks aren\u2019t even a possibility here. But there we go. Panic attack!", "Idk I have watched people fold at phobias when they were in dangerous situations.", "When mean dude's get weird and controlling, I love asking why they're being so irrational or emotional \ud83e\udd0c", "You do not go to couples counseling with an abusive partner.", "Oh my god I feel so seen", "You also shouldn\u2019t be content staying and watching your children get abused but she is. That\u2019s why she\u2019s in Reddit and hasn\u2019t packed her bags", "She\u2019s an adult she\u2019s not a child. This is on you. She should be able to walk past any kind of bug at her age and if she can\u2019t and needs her mommy or daddy to help her she doesn\u2019t have the emotional fitness her age demands. That\u2019s poor parenting and it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s your husbands fault"]}
