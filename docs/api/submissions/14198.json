Since Cal was little, she's had an extreme fear of bugs. This could be because she got stung by honeybees twice while playing in a garden, and once a wasp entered her swimsuit that she left outside and she put it on without checking, so you can guess what happened. Anyway, we all know how much she hates bugs so we all kind of shield her if a bug is near (ETA: we did this more when she had been recently bitten, we knew this couldn't go on forever so we got her into therapy for a bit and while she can walk past most bugs alright now, she may get tensed up), I know this cannot go on forever and we are slowly working on making her less bothered by their presence because if you panic, a bug is more likely to attack.\n\nOn to what happened: our landlord's daughter is getting married soon so the entire building is decorated with lights and lamps, and they attract a lot of bugs. Cal is no longer afraid of the smaller ones and we keep our doors and windows closed so the big ones don't get in, but last night, a really big, brown grasshopper like bug entered from somewhere and was in the living room. Cal had to get something from there so she just stood at the entrance before calling for her dad to remove the bug. I was in the kitchen and thought nothing of it, until I heard my husband talking aggressively and assertively. I went to check, and Cal was almost in tears as my husband was forcing her to walk across the room, past the bug, to get what she needed.\n\nHe was scolding her the entire time, asking her to grow up and that he was tired of helping her like she was a baby. I'm not gonna lie it really pissed me off so I asked my husband to leave, shooed the bug away then got Cal what she needed. She looked really upset so I consoled her before she went back to her room.\n\nI was really angry at my husband so I yelled at him that the way he treated Cal was very cruel, to which he yelled back that he was just trying to make her get rid of her fear because she's an adult and needs to act like it. I told him that terrifying her by scolding and forcibly making her cross a bug isn't the right way to make her get rid of her fear and he told me that I was the reason my daughters were so spoiled (they're NOT, I know it may sound like I'm saying this because I'm their mom but they're literally the most soft spoken, down to earth girls ever. The reason my husband thinks they're spoiled is because he's super controlling and my daughters went to the movies last week with their friends.) I'm so done with this man but could he have been right? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: The bug was grasshopper like (in appearance) not a grasshopper. I don't know the english term for this insect but they are super fast and tend to climb up the person walking past them thats why she was so afraid. My daughter can walk past, or remove most bugs alright but she's still not comfortable with them touching or climbing on her thats why she called my husband this one time", "created_utc": 1680851410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ecwz4/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husband_for_trying_to_make/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can take care of bugs when I'm alone after psyching myself up... but if there's someone else around who isn't scared of bugs, then I ask for help. We don't need to be 100% independent and constantly fighting our fears at all times. We're human. Sometimes humans want help. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBesides, Cal DOES have a phobia, which is much harder to fight than a plain old fear. Some people in this thread don't understand how phobias work. OP said she's been in therapy and her phobia has gotten better, which means she IS working on it. She's just not completely cured yet.

The only way your daughter will learn that those kinds of bugs aren't so bad, is seriously only something she can figure out on her own. That or seek some counseling/therapy if it's really bothering your husband so badly. But if he's not going to pay for therapy and help your daughter the appropriate way. He shouldn't be snapping at his kids that way.  \n\n\n  \nNext time he yells at you the same way ask him \"what are you trying to get rid of from me?\" see the look on his face.", "NTA ,but you're overprotective and your husband is too harsh.
