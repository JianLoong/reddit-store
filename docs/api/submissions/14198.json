Since Cal was little, she's had an extreme fear of bugs. This could be because she got stung by honeybees twice while playing in a garden, and once a wasp entered her swimsuit that she left outside and she put it on without checking, so you can guess what happened. Anyway, we all know how much she hates bugs so we all kind of shield her if a bug is near (ETA: we did this more when she had been recently bitten, we knew this couldn't go on forever so we got her into therapy for a bit and while she can walk past most bugs alright now, she may get tensed up), I know this cannot go on forever and we are slowly working on making her less bothered by their presence because if you panic, a bug is more likely to attack.\n\nOn to what happened: our landlord's daughter is getting married soon so the entire building is decorated with lights and lamps, and they attract a lot of bugs. Cal is no longer afraid of the smaller ones and we keep our doors and windows closed so the big ones don't get in, but last night, a really big, brown grasshopper like bug entered from somewhere and was in the living room. Cal had to get something from there so she just stood at the entrance before calling for her dad to remove the bug. I was in the kitchen and thought nothing of it, until I heard my husband talking aggressively and assertively. I went to check, and Cal was almost in tears as my husband was forcing her to walk across the room, past the bug, to get what she needed.\n\nHe was scolding her the entire time, asking her to grow up and that he was tired of helping her like she was a baby. I'm not gonna lie it really pissed me off so I asked my husband to leave, shooed the bug away then got Cal what she needed. She looked really upset so I consoled her before she went back to her room.\n\nI was really angry at my husband so I yelled at him that the way he treated Cal was very cruel, to which he yelled back that he was just trying to make her get rid of her fear because she's an adult and needs to act like it. I told him that terrifying her by scolding and forcibly making her cross a bug isn't the right way to make her get rid of her fear and he told me that I was the reason my daughters were so spoiled (they're NOT, I know it may sound like I'm saying this because I'm their mom but they're literally the most soft spoken, down to earth girls ever. The reason my husband thinks they're spoiled is because he's super controlling and my daughters went to the movies last week with their friends.)

I don't know the english term for this insect but they are super fast and tend to climb up the person walking past them thats why she was so afraid. My daughter can walk past, or remove most bugs alright but she's still not comfortable with them touching or climbing on her thats why she called my husband this one time\n\nEdit 2: Yes she had been in therapy and she's made great progress so far though the therapist said the phobia may never be cured; she could only learn to suppress it. We were also told that pushing her to overcome her fear may make it worse - the reason why I was so pissed at my husband.", "created_utc": 1680851410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ecwz4/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husband_for_trying_to_make/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can take care of bugs when I'm alone after psyching myself up... but if there's someone else around who isn't scared of bugs, then I ask for help.

The only way your daughter will learn that those kinds of bugs aren't so bad, is seriously only something she can figure out on her own. That or seek some counseling/therapy if it's really bothering your husband so badly. But if he's not going to pay for therapy and help your daughter the appropriate way. He shouldn't be snapping at his kids that way.  \n\n\n  \nNext time he yells at you the same way ask him \"what are you trying to get rid of from me?\" see the look on his face.", "NTA ,but you're overprotective and your husband is too harsh.

What  do you do? Scream and possibly wet yourself until someone comes to save you? Or do yoou also ever refuse to be alone? Do you not go out when in the fall all of the world is covered in webs and baby spiders fly? do you never enter forests?  \nA whole range of life experiences are unavailable to you because of your phobia. This is the definition of impairment. \n\nI am too afraid of spiders. I am also capable of independently handling my fear and I am not bared from anything. Hence, no impaitment.", "Refusing to deal with a spider on my own is not equivalent to not being in an independent adult. Ideal with encountering maybe one spider a year, so one time a year I happen to be afraid to go into a room. My roommates, happen to be kind enough to deal with the spiders for me. That's not severely impaired. It affecting my life once a year, is not severe impairment. If I had to deal with them on a regular basis, I'm sure I would eventually get accustomed to doing it myself. But given that I rarely encounter spiders in my home, It's not an inconvenience.\n\nI am a functioning healthy adult. Just because you don't think that, doesn't make it true. You don't know me. You don't know my life. You don't know how I interact with things and people day today. Therefore, the only information you have about me is whatever you read in my comments. Therefore you cannot make an accurate assumption about how \"impaired\" I am or my life is. You cannot make an accurate informed decision on that. What you are doing, is allowing your own feelings to cloud your judgment. Which I refuse to do. Have the day karma thinks you've earned with calling functioning healthy adults severely impaired. Because let me tell you, that's not a good look. It just makes you look petty and bitter. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
