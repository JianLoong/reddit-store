Since Cal was little, she's had an extreme fear of bugs. This could be because she got stung by honeybees twice while playing in a garden, and once a wasp entered her swimsuit that she left outside and she put it on without checking, so you can guess what happened. Anyway, we all know how much she hates bugs so we all kind of shield her if a bug is near (ETA: we did this more when she had been recently bitten, we knew this couldn't go on forever so we got her into therapy for a bit and while she can walk past most bugs alright now, she may get tensed up), I know this cannot go on forever and we are slowly working on making her less bothered by their presence because if you panic, a bug is more likely to attack.\n\nOn to what happened: our landlord's daughter is getting married soon so the entire building is decorated with lights and lamps, and they attract a lot of bugs. Cal is no longer afraid of the smaller ones and we keep our doors and windows closed so the big ones don't get in, but last night, a really big, brown grasshopper like bug entered from somewhere and was in the living room. Cal had to get something from there so she just stood at the entrance before calling for her dad to remove the bug. I was in the kitchen and thought nothing of it, until I heard my husband talking aggressively and assertively. I went to check, and Cal was almost in tears as my husband was forcing her to walk across the room, past the bug, to get what she needed.\n\nHe was scolding her the entire time, asking her to grow up and that he was tired of helping her like she was a baby. I'm not gonna lie it really pissed me off so I asked my husband to leave, shooed the bug away then got Cal what she needed. She looked really upset so I consoled her before she went back to her room.\n\nI was really angry at my husband so I yelled at him that the way he treated Cal was very cruel, to which he yelled back that he was just trying to make her get rid of her fear because she's an adult and needs to act like it. I told him that terrifying her by scolding and forcibly making her cross a bug isn't the right way to make her get rid of her fear and he told me that I was the reason my daughters were so spoiled (they're NOT, I know it may sound like I'm saying this because I'm their mom but they're literally the most soft spoken, down to earth girls ever. The reason my husband thinks they're spoiled is because he's super controlling and my daughters went to the movies last week with their friends.) I'm so done with this man but could he have been right? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: The bug was grasshopper like (in appearance) not a grasshopper. I don't know the english term for this insect but they are super fast and tend to climb up the person walking past them thats why she was so afraid. My daughter can walk past, or remove most bugs alright but she's still not comfortable with them touching or climbing on her thats why she called my husband this one time\n\nEdit 2: Yes she had been in therapy and she's made great progress so far though the therapist said the phobia may never be cured; she could only learn to suppress it. We were also told that pushing her to overcome her fear may make it worse - the reason why I was so pissed at my husband.", "created_utc": 1680851410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ecwz4/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husband_for_trying_to_make/", "score": 157, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can take care of bugs when I'm alone after psyching myself up... but if there's someone else around who isn't scared of bugs, then I ask for help. We don't need to be 100% independent and constantly fighting our fears at all times. We're human. Sometimes humans want help.

OP said she's been in therapy and her phobia has gotten better, which means she IS working on it. She's just not completely cured yet.

The only way your daughter will learn that those kinds of bugs aren't so bad, is seriously only something she can figure out on her own. That or seek some counseling/therapy if it's really bothering your husband so badly. But if he's not going to pay for therapy and help your daughter the appropriate way. He shouldn't be snapping at his kids that way.  \n\n\n  \nNext time he yells at you the same way ask him \"what are you trying to get rid of from me?\" see the look on his face.", "NTA ,but you're overprotective and your husband is too harsh.

He probably was super freaked out but a grown woman coming to him asking him to come into her apartment to kill a spider for her but freaked out more when he saw the size of the thing. He did kill it and disposed of the body for me though which was very kind!\n\nMy last straw was almost stepping on one in our bedroom that my husband even got squirmish about as it was the size of his palm. It has actual mass to it. We moved not long after that. My husband knew my fears and even wrote in his vows that he promised to kill all the spiders for me no matter how big or small.\n\nBut all this to say\u2026. Your husband gets an F in parenting. He actually surpassed my AH father that left fake spiders on our pillows to try to tease us. How traumatic for your daughter and I hope that you can comfort her and encourage her to continue with therapy. Give her my well wishes from one daughter of an AH to another. And maybe try to convince your AH husband to try some therapy of his own to try his hand at this little thing called empathy.", "NTA . I can empathise with your daughter , as someone that has lepideptorophobia( fear of butterflies ) exposure therapy only works if the person that had the phobia is an willing particiant, when I was a teenager my brother tried to\"fix\" my fear by stuffing a moth down my shirt , you can imagine how swell that went for me . I am currently 34 and still ask my partner to dispose of any flying pests in my vicinity. Your husband is an asshole big time tho and lacks empathy in my humble opinion.", "NTA. I know exactly what type of grasshopper thing you\u2019re talking about, and I\u2019m still scared of those guys as a 33 year old. Phobias are hard to get over and it\u2019s not coddling to be understanding of that.", "I'm in the tarantula, jumping spider, and praying mantis hobbies. While I've never had a phobia of insects, a LOT of people start out in them to overcome a fear of spiders/insects. But it's a process that should only happen if and when the person is ready. Forcing this is cruel to the people with the phobia, and risks needlessly harming the insect.\n\nIf you are going to try and desensitize someone to insects then a grasshopper or a species with similar behavior is a terrible choice because if you're scared of them the behavior and noise they make when they fly at you can seem very intimidating.\n\nI am happy to suggest a few kinds should she ever be interested in trying to overcome her phobia in the future. What your husband can only make it worse, and will make it even more unlikely she'll be open to trying to overcome it in the future. And if she doesn't that's okay. I hate heights, and will not get anywhere near a roller coaster or ferris wheel, and I don't plan on ever trying to change that.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: I would also bring up one of your husband's phobias, and ask him if he'd be okay if someone tried to force him to face it when he wasn't ready, particularly if it was his parents doing it to him. If he's scared of water, and he's not cool with being forced to do scuba lessons then he should show others the same courtesy.", "NTA\n\nInfo: Are you sure you're happy in your relationship? Your description of your husband and his controlling behaviour is giving me the vibe that you're not happy", "I wish my mom stood up for me like you did there :) nta", "I know two whole grown adults who are phobic of birds. Phobias aren't from being coddled or spoiled.", "Is your husband related to Kenneth Copeland, or a fan of his? He's this really creepy American televangelist with a face that looks like an exaggerated prosthetic. I saw this video of him yelling at a camera, jabbing his finger at the viewer: **STOP** ***THAT FEAR, FEAR IS A*** **SIN**\n\nNTA. Even if the therapist didn't advise you not to force her to conquer her anxiety, a fool could've known that this would be counter-productive.", "NTA. Your husband thinks adults don\u2019t have fears? Ridiculous. Good job protecting your daughter", "NTA. At one point in my life I had a phobia of vomiting that was so bad that I could hear someone say \"I have a stomach ache\" and go into a full-on panic attack. My parents thought that exposure therapy (forcing me to watch YouTube videos of vomiting) might cure this. It did not, at all. Did I need to get over my phobia somehow? Yes. But was that the right way? No. A PERSON CANNOT GET OVER A PHOBIA IF THEY DO NOT *WANT* TO GET OVER A PHOBIA. And I did NOT want to watch those videos. I had to get over my phobia in my own time, and I actually DID. I have faith your daughter will too. You might want to talk to her about whether or not she wants to take matters into her own hands. But it already sounds like she's been really strong! <3", "NTA... But you're married to one", "I have a friend with a phobia of frogs and toads. As in she cannot walk past one sitting on the road or sidewalk. Just a picture can start a panic attack.\n\nShe is 40. This is not something that just 'goes away'.", "totally agree, but you should probably space out y t a and e s h!", "You should probably insert space between your Y T A and E S H so the bot doesn't think it's your judgement.\n\nAgree. You don't make people overcome phobias by screaming at them and calling them babies. Also, the husband is calling the daughter's spoiled because they went to the movies?", "I know she deserves it, but apologizing and my husband could never be together in the same sentence :)", "English isn't our first language, and I definitely mistranslated what the therapist had said. You're right management is a better word", "So an adult can't be afraid of something?. I'm 25 and I'm terrified of spiders, even harmless ones. I literally refuse to enter a room if I've seen a spider in it. Gonna call me sheltered to?? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "Phobias can take years to overcome, if at all, even when working with a therapist/psychiatrist. A phobia is more than a simple fear.", "I know, her therapist said that pushing her to overcome her fear will likely make it worse and I still can't believe he did the exact thing! \n\nAnd yes, Cal does fear my husband when he's angry. I'm gonna figure something out", "I'm not coddling her, and no dad never said as much when she was younger because apart from the time she had been recently bitten, she rarely asked for help. I've specified in the edit that she went to therapy and has been doing much better, phobia or no phobia, would you like a finger sized bug crawling up on you? Occasionally helping her while she slowly pushes past her fear isn't enabling her. \n\nAnd the reason I said I'm done with my husband is because he's controlling, toxic and extremely abusive (formerly to me and now in part to my daughters as well). But go off I guess.", "Enabling a phobia that she is getting therapy for? By not shouting at her? What?", "If it were that easy phobias wouldn't exist.", "Literally in the post she is getting professional help. Shouting does nothing.", " \n\nI hate heights, and will never get anywhere near roller coasters or ferris wheels, and I don't plan on trying to change that.", "But if he doesn't pay for therapy and help your daughter appropriately.", "I have the same phobia. Don't know where it came from. Last year, a toad got into our kitchen, and I jumped on the counter and had a full-blown panic attack because I could hear it croaking. I had to call the neighbors to remove it because i was too afraid to get off the counter.", "You mentioned control in your post too. Look up the power and control wheel and see what else fits. Controlling behaviour is at the core of most abusive behaviour but it's often done in a way that's incredibly difficult to recognise until it's pointed out. Your husband was out of line with your daughter and the fact that he had already been told by a professional that his idea would make things worse really makes me wonder what he hoped to achieve. He knew it wasn't going to help her, so what drove his behaviour? \n\nNTA but his reaction to your daughter's phobia is likely the least of your problems here unfortunately", "Almost\u2026trying\u2026somehow? Your ability to detect controlling behaviour is waaaaay off. Your husband was being domineering. He is controlling. There\u2019s no almost here.", "Almost acting?? It sounds like he was giving her a hard time akin to someone stubborn yelling at their inanimate tools for their own mess ups.\n\nLike if someone yells at a hose for squirting water at them.. Or tripping over the garden hose and yelling at the hose itself for being there.", "And is your husband definitely aware of this fact?", "Is your husband also the father of your daughter(s)?", "If he's abusive to you, it's setting a bad example to your daughters about their own future relationships. They will normalise it. It's better to have no father than an abusive one. I wish you luck, I'm sure you can figure something out.", "Your daughters very likely will go no contact with your husband. Soner or later. Your relationship with them will depend on whether you will be together with him or not.", "I'm 28 and I have a strong reaction  to bugs too. If I'm outside and there's buzzing near my ears I shut down. Age doesn't determine phobias. Your husband is an AH and his response to her will make her phobia worse rather than better, he's adding extra anxiety on to an already stressful (for her) situation, ffs.", "Good luck. You seem like a sweet and loving person, and I hope you and your kids get the best of life.", "Yeah, he was a good father when they were young enough to be controlled. Now they\u2019re old enough to have opinions and wishes of their own, he\u2019s clamping down.\n\nYou know his behaviour towards you has never improved; it won\u2019t improve towards your daughters either, it will only get worse.", "I understand. To me that says a lot about your husband, and would be a trigger for me to evaluate the relationship as a whole, to determine whether there\u2019s some action to be taken there.\n\nNot trying to be dramatic and go straight to divorce but am saying, this is your chance to speak up, do counseling, do \u2026 something and help your daughter in the way she deserves / model what she should do in a future relationship.", "Well, that's good, but even though your daughter is working on it, she's reached adulthood seemingly unable to function alone - there's no apartment or college or workplace or airport or park or restaurant, etc. she can keep 100% bug free. Hubby is 100% wrong for thinking his approach will work, but it looks like the method of protection chosen hasn't, either. He went way too far, he was being cruel, not tough love, but I understand his frustration. If it were me, I would have just refused to keep helping, not attacked her.\n\nI'm sorry, and I hope she gets better.", "So an 18 year old isn't allowed to be afraid of something?? Would you say the same thing if she had a fear of large dogs?? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Small dogs?? Cats?? Snakes?? Bears?? All phobias are valid.

Even though my knees quake going up open faced stairs, I can still do that. It's the down part that freaks me out and in the dark is worse.

My oldest already cut him off since she recently moved out for her job though her and I still have a very good relationship (we call/text daily and I visit her frequently). Regardless, I'm gonna figure something out soon", "There's no saving mine and my husband's relationship. It was over the first time he abused me, or hit my oldest so hard she was shivering all night. I've got tears in my eyes as I type this out and this incident has somehow proven that he doesn't care about any of us. I am a SAHM and resources don't help around here, but I'm gonna figure something out now. I'm exhausted and I'm not letting my daughters go through this anymore", "It HAS worked because she has made PROGRESS. therapy doesn't always\"solve\" or \"cure\" the issue/phobia.

I suggest you grow up some.", "Lmao I just ask my roommate or friend to deal with spiders and they do. They understand my fear and don't make me push myself if I can't.

Having a phobia does not make you severely impaired. If you do think that, I suggest some therapy. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Because that's a pretty broken way of thinking. And I'm not sheltered because I've never had to deal with spiders on my own. I just once again, have caring and understanding people in my life who actually love me and don't force me to deal with something that makes me uncomfortable. I do the same thing for them. If they have a phobia or an anxiety that I can help with, I do that, because they have done the same for me. It's called being respectful, and actually caring about someone other than yourself. It's being empathetic. I suggest you try it sometime. It does wonders. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Was worth asking"]}
