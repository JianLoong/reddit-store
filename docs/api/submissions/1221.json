You're all grown adults some married and have kids... And you're ALL back living with your mom? V confused about this story. Her kids, grandkids and a LITERAL puppy mill just moved back in with her and you have the gall to call her \"kinda the worst\" \ud83d\ude33 No wonder she's crabby all the... Can't believe she hasn't had a complete mental breakdown at this point tbh. Maybe instead of paying your mom so much more money, you should save that money and get your own place so your mom can have her home (and sanity) back.\n\nYTA\n\nSo are your siblings.", "How do you know that she'll change her behavior?", "ESH - What a train wreck of a family. Oh and tell your brother to knock off the puppy mill crap.", "YTA because this can\u2019t possibly be good for your siblings, and it may not be as good for you as you think. \n\nBest case scenario: your mom leaves you alone. She has extra pent up anger, which then gets distributed among your siblings. They seem like they\u2019re under far more stress than you are, so they really don\u2019t need that. You\u2019re also kind of throwing it in their face that you have the means to \u201cbuy\u201d your way out of your mom\u2019s anger. They won\u2019t take that well. They\u2019re clearly struggling and you\u2019re just adding to their stress, all the while reminding them that your life is easier than theirs. That shows a lack of understanding and a lack of sympathy toward your siblings. \n\nWorst case: It does nothing to appease your mother and you\u2019re paying more for nothing. \n\nIf you\u2019re that concerned about how your mother is going to treat your SO, you need to find a different approach. Talk to your mother about how her behavior makes everyone feel. Explain to your SO that this behavior from your mother is not personal and remind him that the situation is only temporary. Or find somewhere else to live. You clearly have more income than your siblings and no kids, so maybe it\u2019s best to give them some extra space and find somewhere else to go. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that your mother is under quite a bit of stress too. She may not be the best person to begin with, but she\u2019s under added stress with all these extra people. Now you\u2019re adding favoritism into the mix, which can only make her stress and your relationship with your siblings worse. \n\nYTA because you\u2019re clearly only thinking of yourself and your SO, when your situation appears to be miles better than everyone else in this situation.", "What on earth is going on here? \n\nI sentence you to: \n\nGood luck sorry this sounds shitty", " I think I'd rather stay in a dumpy one room studio apartment beside a cemetery before moving back into that mess. \n\nESH. This sounds like a nightmare. Even if you buy off your mom to be nice to your BF, all the other shit is going to send him over the edge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s the worst because she told my brother she would never love his \u201coil and water, mixed breed, mutt child.\u201d She\u2019s the worse because she told my oldest sister that \u201cshe was sucking a man\u2019s dick and her daughters 7/8 would be sucking his balls\u201d she maced her 7y/o trying to mace her 27 year old.

My mom has been this way for 30 years. We\u2019ve talked to her, about more stuff, about worse stuff. We\u2019re far passed talking to her. There is no talking.
