I've been hiding them and sneaking them while my husband is at work.\n\nHe came to find out about it recently when he accidentally discovered one of my hiding spots. He was really upset upon discovering it and ask me why do I think I know better than him when he is a doctor and literally went to school to study this stuff.\n\nHe told me that now that I've been eating junk food this whole time that he's going to have to take away my cheat days and will be inviting his mom to move in with us to insure that I'm eating a healthy diet so our babies ( I'm pregnant with twins) have a better chance at life and delivery.\n\nI feel so upset with this because I don't feel like it's right for me to be controlled this way at the end of the day it's my body and I don't eat that much junk food.\n\nI know that he's a doctor but it's not for him to control everything that I eat I would never put our children in any harms way and eating a few Twinkies won't hurt them.\n\nIt's not like I'm smoking a cigarette or drinking while pregnant I really just eat a few twinkies on occasion.\n\nI understand that he's a doctor and he understands nutrition and what's good for the babies but I sometimes just need a break.\n\nI'm even thinking about staying with my parents if he does decide to invite his mom in our place I think it's unfair and very controlling that he's even threatening to do this.\n\nI was never even consulted on this diet that he put me on he just assumed that I'd be okay with it because this is how I usually eat anyway but at the same time I have cravings and I don't think it's unfair for me to follow them sometimes.\n\nAm I in the wrong for sneaking junk food behind my husband's back?", "created_utc": 1676855620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116ttvq/aita_for_eating_junk_food_behind_my_husbands_back/", "score": 3348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Concern is normal. Control is not. He's already making you feel like a bad mother, and you haven't even given birth yet. If he can't trust you to carry children, why is he having them with you? Trying to make it about his medical expertise is a diversion. If he's experiencing anxiety, he needs to address it instead of causing you anxiety.
