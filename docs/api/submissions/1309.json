You set your boundaries. He can overshare to someone else if he needs to.", "NTA. He's simply a narcissist that's looking for someone to feel sorry for him.  When you obviously don't, it causes him to lash out.", "I'd say NTA. Was he also Oversharing things beforehand? Or is this just recent behaviour.\nI really don't wanna sound mean but his diagnosis might make him think that it is okay for him to act like an asshole because in his mind he has right and reason to do so.\n(Which he hasn't)", "NTA. This reads like medical anxiety to me, but still, if he is experiencing that and feels a need to share those anxieties with others, it is his responsibility to find people who are able and willing to carry that burden. This might include a therapist, but friends should not be expected to provide that kind of emotional labor if they don't want to.", "That\u2019s the difficult part, he said setting any sort of boundary on oversharing is just me not accepting his condition and the medical details are non-negotiable", "Definitely, my wife and I pretty much knew he was neurodivergent before he got formally diagnosed since we have other ND friends and family. The main difference was that before he was diagnosed, he\u2019d talk about D&D or philosophy and stuff, now it\u2019s mostly his personal psychological/neurological info"]}
