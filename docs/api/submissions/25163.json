If it started looking \u201c stringy\u201d, I was urged to cut it. \n\nWhen my kids were young, I kept it on the shorter side & then ended up with a short haircut (pixie) for years. I let it grow out for my daughter\u2019s wedding 8 years ago & haven\u2019t cut it since. (It\u2019s shoulder blade length now & I enjoy having long hair)\n\nMy grandson (that I\u2019m guardian of, now 17) used to let a piece at the top of his grow out. He bleached it & dyed it green. The green faded to blond & the rest (sides & back) were kept short & dark. He recently cut all of the blonde part off & went back to dark hair. I don\u2019t care. He can cut (or not cut) his hair however he wishes. \n\nHair is hair. It grows back.", "I don\u2019t think it matters either way since the daughter is the one that wanted a haircut regardless of if she\u2019s indigenous or not.", "The hair had to be cut. Mom just had to be involved. It's a minor ding on dad. But it would have avoided a situation where mom is made the bad guy. Remember that the hair didn't just become this long. Mom has been doing the maintenance for quite a while and probably living vicariously.", "A girl who doesn\u2019t want to spend hours taking care of 4-foot-long hair everyday can absolutely still be a girl, Reddit needs to stop assigning identities to people ffs", "That's a huge assumption considering how absolutely bogstandard it is for cultures to impose specific standards for hair onto women and judge them for violating those norms. No reason to assume this a young woman is tired of the work culturally demanded hair requires and wanting to cut it to reduce the sheet workload and have some more autonomy. \n\nIt's not even like she chose an especially *short* or *masculine* haircut, or expressed interest in one. I think the daughter just wants more control over herself and less constant hair maintenance.", "Honestly, she didn't even get that short of a haircut, she's not got a pixie cut, it's just shoulder length. \u0130t sounds like she didn't want to deal with multiple feet of hair, which is so understandable.", "Omg i have thick heavy hair too! If it reaches past my shoulder blades i get such bad headaches from the weight. Plus theres HAVING to have it up or styled in sone way or ending up having hella knots to detangle throughout the day if i dont. This kid had their hair to their THIGHS!", "I have thick wavy hair that reaches to my armpits and believe me, it is heavy enough! I have no interest in growing it out to a ridiculous, impractical length. Hair is an important expression of who we are and OP's ex denied their daughter autonomy over this matter. It's a haircut, not the overturning of civilization, and Mad Mama needs to get over it.", "I used to have long hair. Mine is like yours thick and heavy. I have a few tips. Would you be comfortable with getting half of your head shaved in the back and then the long hair would cover that up. You would feel a lot cooler and it would be easier to style. Or see if your hair dresser can razor your hair. Its used to thin the mass of thick hair and make it lighter and more manageable. I had a lot of relief doing. \n\nBut now I get it cut short every summer to right below my ears and I shave half of my head in the back. Im able to whip it up in a fast ponytail and its a lot cooler for me now.", "as someone with thick hair (not long currently though and never was long long, longest was mid back \\[though was extremely wavy with some curls so technically was longer\\]) i can say that it is a NIGHTMARE to brush when long and it gets in the way ALL the time. also it used to get frizzy after i brushed it so even if i wanted to have it down, i would look awful so i always wore it in a ponytail (it was not a good ponytail though)", "Had my hair long for 4 years, went super short this spring.  Weight wasn't the issue, but heat and hair in my face was.  And the amount of time to dry it.", "My mom's Puerto Rican cousin had her hair down to her butt when they were teenagers, and her father refused to let her cut it due to cultural views, despite the fact that it was thick and curly and giving her CONSTANT MIGRAINES. She doesn't keep it longer than her shoulders anymore, hasn't since the moment she was allowed to cut it", "Hell my hair is fine as fuck but I have a lot of it and when it\u2019s longer it\u2019s heavy.  I just got it cut from just below my shoulder blades to chin length and even that made my head feel so much lighter.  I can barely imagine how heavy thigh length hair would be.  I only ever grew it waist length cause of the weight and care requirements.", "Next time you go to the salon ask for a silent appointment! They are becoming more popular and most stylists I've heard talk about them do so positively. Sometimes they want a break from talking all day too.", "These sort of comments both amaze me and make me jealous. It takes me multiple years for my hair to grow a few inches. I've never had waist length hair and it wasn't for lack of trying. It just grows that slow.", "Yup, my 5yo son wanted Batman's logo buzzed on his temple, even my wife hasn't tried to talk him out. He liked it a lot, we didn't that much, but we always said it looks cool", "I genuinely hate these discussions. In the real world, you can't always get both parents to agree, especially if they're divorced. The kid was being abused. Her hair needed to be cut. Talking to the mother wouldn't have changed anything. She believed long hair is a sign of womanhood. And longer the better. The daughter wanted it shorter. There is no compromise, middle ground, or well reasoned discussion to be had here. I would not have been okay sending my daughter back to her mom's after she broke down crying like that without remedying the situation.", "I used gender neutral terms, not sure how that assigns anything.  We were talking the mother's rant on social media, not the OPs actions.", "We were talking the mother's rant on social media, not the OPs actions.", " We were talking the mother's rant on social media, not the OPs actions.", "The knots are the worst when they're close to the scalp!\nAnd not sure who else does this, but I sleep with my hair pulled back in a Scrunchie so that it doesn't accidentally get caught under my husband's arm when he turns over during the night.", "My hair is weird, it's on the thicker side but it's pretty much straight without having to style it. I use to have really long hair when I was younger but got it cut shorter during my teenage years and haven't looked back lol - even now I sometimes try to let it grow and once it hits a certain point I'm like NOPE, back to shoulder length! I couldn't imagine his poor daughter having it to her thighs and having to maintain it!", "Hell yeah, his friends probably though it was cool!", "As I stated before- cut the hair, but tell the mom first. This is similar to firing a bad employee. It has to be done, and they are not going to accept it , but you want to be straightforward- tell them what is happening and do it. They shouldn't show up to the office and find their badge doesn't work. It just creates unwanted anger and retaliation from feeling powerless.", ">I was thinking it sounds like the kid is Trans\n\nHow is that not assigning the kid an identity?", "You made a huge assumption that a girl not wanting hair past her thighs is trans.  As a trans person (agender), that is fucked up.  OP\u2019s daughter could have cut her hair into a pixie with an undercut and that STILL wouldn\u2019t mean she is trans.  Assigning gender to hair length and style is transphobic though, as well as misogynistic and that\u2019s likely what is behind the daughter\u2019s maternal family\u2019s reactions.  Bigotry and misogyny", "I braid my hair now for sleeping its easier, scrunchies fall out for me and the accidental arm to the hair in the middle of the night SUCKS!!!!", "Because we're talking about the rant the mother posted, not the op or the kid. If I had heard someone ranting her ex stripped her child of their femininity,  I would not have assumed it was about a haircut. I would have assumed she's a bigot.", "I think the commenter above you means that the phrase \"stripping her of her womanhood\" makes it sound like OP is forcing the kid to live as a boy or something", "Context is important.  Someone said the rant sounds like the father assaulted the daughter, I said the rant makes it sound like the child is non gender conforming. I was only talking about the mother's social media rant and how she comes off, not about Op, the child, or the haircut. There was no assuming short hair = Trans.", "Wish I could do that!"]}
