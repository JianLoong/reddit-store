She started to cry harder and told me how much she hates her hair, that it takes her hours each day to brush through them due to how thick they are and how hot and tired it makes her feel, I'm not even mentioning styling them. She also told me how she wants to dye them, but Marie would not let her do this as it would ruin her hair and is a \"bad taste\". I have hugged her and told her not to worry and I will think of something.\n\nI have called my sister and explained the situation to her, she organised an appointment for next day with her hair stylist to look at Lily's hair and do something with it.

She and her whole family started berating me for it and making horrible comments about Lily, so she ended up coming back to me and is staying with me.

What's Lily supposed to do with this enforced symbol of \"womanhood\" she's carrying at age 14? The horrible thoughts that brings up! It sounds like an outdated burden and repressive. Lily must feel so light a d happy with her new haircut.", "NTA. \n\nI was SIXTEEN before my parents let me cut my hair to my waist. It wasn't even a religious thing or anything, my mom was just a tyrant. \n\nKids made fun of me relentlessly. I got gum stuck in my hair (to which my mom would just pull out the peanut butter) My hair would even get into the toilet sometimes. That was disgusting. \n\nI don't find a problem with parents setting some limits on hair like no dying (after all, some of those chemicals are carcinogens) or no mohawks. Yet, when a parent has a child totally under their thumb and won't let them express any individuality at all, that's a huge red flag to me.", "Oh, Dad...NTA. Ignore the ex, and just concentrate on the woman you're raising.", "NTA - you are doing what\u2019s right for your daughter. SHE is the one who makes decisions about her own body. Your ex\u2019s outdated ideas of femininity are irrelevant. The ONLY relevant opinion is your daughters. Kudos to you for listening to her and standing up for her wants and needs", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is 14 and old enough to decide her own body and personal image\n\nHer mom was being controlling and frankly abusive forcing her to maintain that hair if she wasn't comfortable", "NTA perhaps it's cultural and I def want to be sensitive to that but as someone who has very thick hair that tangles easily I know Lily's pain. Besides, I think 14 is old enough to start making choices about how she wants her hair to look.", "NTA - I can understand the cultural subtext from your ex, but what she is forcing on your daughter is borderline coercive and abusive.\n\nYou did good, and I hope your relationship with your daughter will continue strong.", "NTA. Your daughter is old enough to make her own choices about her hair.\n\nShe doesn't even have womanhood yet, she has girlhood, and that and her femininity are not dependent on the length of her hair.", "NTA, but mom is displaying behavior that is borderline child abuse.", "I think you did something nice for your daughter.  NTA.  \n\nBeauty is on the inside, yo.", "NTA - Ask your ex's family if any of them even thought of asking your Daughter what she wanted.", "NTA - at 14 lily should decide what she wants to do with her hair. Donating it was a kind, generous and mature thing to do. Good for her and you for listening to your daughter.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like a perfect example of 'toxic femininity'", "NTA\n\nLily is 14. 14 year old humans can walk in to a chain hair place, and get a haircut in exchange for a modest sum of money. Haircuts do not require parental consent.", "NTA. I am 100% on Lily's side. Long hair is an absolute bother, and I too hate it. I imagine her tipping point was like mine - an unreasonable mother who refused to let her cut it to a reasonable length. There is a certain point where not everything has to be run by the other parent. Especially if it's something the minor can easily do on their own. After all, nothing was stopping her from taking scissors to her hair and hacking it off herself. You did the right thing; Lily is happy and someone else will get a little joy in their life.", "NTA.\n\nYou're THE dad she deserves and did a good job in showing her freedom or choice in how she looks.

Plus, it grows!", "NTA for taking your daughter to the hair dresser because that's what she wanted. She didn't asked for something dangerous or weird, it's a perfectly normal for children to choose what to do with their own hair.\n\nThat said, you were a bit na\u00efve. You know that your ex wouldn't be ok with it and would probably be mad. This should have been discussed with your ex, even if you decided to bring your daughter to the hair dresser without the consent of her mom. You should also have been there when your daughter reached home to see how your ex would react and shield your daughter from at least the worst of the backlash when the mom saw her.", "NTA she isn't bald , your wife overreacted", "NTA absolutely!  You are a good Dad who *listens* to his daughter.", "NTA it\u2019s her hair, if she wants it cut she should be able to", "NTA your ex is for putting her daughter through unnecessary and easily avoidable stress.", "NTA. I was the opposite. I wasn\u2019t allowed hair below my shoulders. This didn\u2019t suit my face and I hated the way I looked but I still wasn\u2019t allowed to grow it out. I still have trauma and image issues.", "NTA, thanks for being a great dad. I have also very thick hair and it's such a hassle to maintain. By the way, if your daughter wants it longer in the future but not as thick, let the barber get it cut with a knife close to the scalp to reduce the volume and not the length, that's what I am doing in summer. That you donated her hair is beautiful, too.", "NTA. Lily is 14 and is certainly able to decide the length she would like her hair. Your ex has some very twisted ideas about women that you need to protect her from.", "NTA. It's only hair. Kids - even through their teen years - don't have a ton of freedoms. They can't choose where they live, where they go to school. They're often reliant on parents or other adults to get them around. When you can allow your teen a measure of freedom you should, especially for low-stakes things like a haircut.  \n\n\nIf you'd pressured your daughter to get her hair cut then you'd be a massive asshole, but that's not the case. You're defending her right to bodily autonomy against her mother and other relatives. You're the good guy in this one.", "Nta shes 14 and should be able to make decisions about her hair. She\u2019s a good kid because I would have taken the scissors to my hair myself.", "NTA She is 14 and should be spending her time on activities, homework and friends, not hours A day brushing hair that she doesn\u2019t WANT. She is old enough to decide in her own hair style.", "NTA\n\nbecause lily wishes it and you granted the wish", "NTA for allowing your daughter some bodily autonomy.
