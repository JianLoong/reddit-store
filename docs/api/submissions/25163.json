She's 14 and old enough to decide for herself. I'm assuming she's well past the age of her mom washing, brushing and styling it everyday and that mom would pitch a fit if her daughter decided that she wasn't going to maintain it anymore. So it only makes sense that she be able to decide what she wants to maintain. I have long hair myself. I love it and would fall apart if it was suddenly gone. That being said, it's a lot of work, especially when the temps are pushing 105\u00b0F. I'd probably cry too if I were having to maintain and deal with it if I didn't love it so much. It does make me feel feminine but the key point to remember is that it makes me FEEL more feminine but it does not MAKE me more feminine. \n\nThe part in all this that I have the most issue with is that your wife is tying the length of her hair directly to her daughter's femininity. Would she be less feminine if a younger sibling decided to play \"beauty school\" and accidentally used real scissors? Or, God forbid, she were to get hurt and need stitches requiring a part to be shaved? Does she all of a sudden lose her girl card if her hair doesn't reach a certain length? And what length might that be? Does that apply to bangs? The length of one's hair in no way correlates to the degree of one's femininity. Hell, the possession of female sex organs doesn't even correlate to the degree of one's femininity. Femininity is a feeling that one decides for themself. While I love my long hair, it is not what makes me a woman and I really have a problem with another woman imposing these damaging ideals to her young daughter. Your wife is basically telling her that she does not have a right to decide what's going to happen to her body and that other people's opinions about her gender matter more than her own. I've seen gorgeously feminine women with pixie cuts and shaved heads. I've seen ridiculously masculine men with hair longer than my own and all the variatios in between. Your wife is sending a dangerous message to a girl in one the most confusing stages of her life. Early teens is the time where a parent's lessons become solidified in a child's mind. I, personally, would not want my daughter believing that something as transient as a hairstyle has so much bearing on something as personal as her gender or that she is wrong for wanting to control what is happening on and to her body. \n\nAgain, you're doing a great job OP. I'm even giving extra kudos for calling your sister for help. You didn't just take her to the $20 Mega-Cuts on the corner or hack it off with kitchen scissors. You were smart enough to know that you were entering unknown territory and asked for guidance from someone you trust and who has your daughter's best interest at heart. I've been so happy to read more and more great dad stories on Reddit lately. You have now been added to the list of amazing dads who might not know all the answers but who are ready and willing to ask advice and learn from it so they can raise strong, confident and wonderful daughters who will be armed with self respect and bodily autonomy. I'm the oldest daughter raised by a single dad (mom was always in the picture and there for me but Dad had my siblings and I for 80% of the time) so I do know that we don't always make it easy. But I can also see when a dad is putting in the time & effort to raise a daughter ready to take on the world & believe in herself. You are one of those dads! Keep up the good work!", "If they\u2019re Seventh Day Adventist that whole \u201clong hair = femininity \u201c thing is in full play. SDA women aren\u2019t supposed to cut their hair. Some other Christian groups are big on women having long hair too. At least that\u2019s what comes to mind.\n\nEither way, NTA OP! Your daughter was miserable and you did something to help her. It\u2019s a shame her mother isn\u2019t willing to do the same \ud83d\ude14", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA, she is 14 not 4, she is caring for and doing all the daily maintenance on her own hair, and she\u2019s old enough to make that decision. You didn\u2019t let her shave her head, or dye it purple, or do anything extreme, and your concern for your daughter shows you\u2019re a good dad and just trying to help make life easier and more manageable for her. As someone with long extremely thick hair, it can be very frustrating and difficult. Keep prioritising your daughter, sounds like she needs someone on her side as mom and moms family sound unreasonable and this likely won\u2019t be the last battle she needs your support in.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is 14 y/o and should be allowed to determine the length of her hair.  Wow.  If Lily changes her mind, she can grow it out again.\n\nI loved my hair long but wasn't combing it; just put it in a scrunch/ie.  I had a foot cut off and never went back.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is damn well old enough to choose her own hairstyle, and she was suffering, physically, from the one her mother imposed on her. \n\nYou know what's really cool and womanly? Autonomy over one's own body.", "NTA. Lily has body autonomy. Your ex-wife dland her family don't get to dictate what someone else does with their bodily autonomy. As an AFAB person who has had butt leigth hair most of my life, especially thick hair, it is *exhausting* to take care of. You have to brush, style, wash, dry, use special products(expensive most of the time). It's a lot. And the fact that your ex-wife and her family for forcing some shitty gender standards on your daughter definitely make them TAs. I just cut most of my hair off, from my thighs to middle-ish/bra strap length, it was a relief. It's hot, a lot of places it's humid, it's heavy. So thank you for standing up for your kid.", "Personally, I think at 14 your daughter should be able to decide for herself. I let my daughter choose from the age of 12 on with the exception I wanted her senior pics to have her natural hair color. Other than that, she chose what to do with her hair.", "NTA.  She got her hair cut on your visitation schedule.  Oh well.  Maybe Marie should listen to her child instead of forcing an outdated sexist custom.  She can shave her head  bald and still be both feminine and a woman.  Hair is a personal choice.  Her daughter is spending hours on something she hates because Marie says so.   Marie is making her cry.  Period. \nHopefully she can stay with you on going.  It\u2019s atrocious she name called her own baby due to hair length.  Wtf??", "NTA. Your child was in tears and miserable because she was weighed down with so much hair. You\u2019re a great dad. Her mom and that side of the family weren\u2019t listening to her.

I hate parents who try to dictate everything about their child's life and appearance. She is a teenager, she wants/needs to express herself.

You gave your daughter back agency over her own body. It's no one else's business what she does with her own hair.", "NTA - it's just hair. Hair has nothing to do with gender. Half the time my teenage son has longer hair than I do (mom) and it's a complete non-issue", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is old enough to decide herself how long she wants her hair and your wife was being abusive by forcing her to keep it that long (I have hip long hair and some days I hate it too, it takes so much time).\n\nYou knew what your wife would say, so there was no sense in talking to her first.\n\nGo and keep standing up for your daughter, it looks like you're the only one listening to what SHE wants.", "My parents encouraged long hair but also just sighed and evened it out when I trimmed it myself.  It wasn\u2019t a huge deal.  Though to be fair, my dad has always wanted my brother to have his hair longer than he likes it.  My sister and I still wear it long, but more mid back or so with occasional shorter cuts. I just hacked a few inches off yesterday and nobody will even notice.\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s acting like he did much more to her than let her cut her hair is very scary.

Her womanhood and femininity are Lily's business, and at 14 she's fully able to make decisions about her hair. It's not her mom who has to deal with the daily care. A teen who goes through life hating part of her body is going to have it harder than she should - and completely unnecessarily if it's such an easily changed part, which even grows back if she changes her mind.\n\nIt's abusive of your ex to berate her for it.

Mom needs to take a hint and stop being a bully to her own kid.", "Ignore them, she is old enough to make her own choice on this one.", "NTA.  You are her parent, she is 14, and this was her hair and what she wanted.  Full stop.", "NTA. You did a wonderfully good thing for your daughter", "My mom forced me to have long hair growing up, too.

Mind you she keeps her hair short as well. One day, I finally got fed up and asked her why does she cut her hair if it\u2019s so important? Couldn\u2019t give me an answer. Ever since then, I hear no complaints about my short hair.", "NTA, screw any culture that dictates how a woman or girl keeps her hair or appearance.

She\u2019s plenty old enough to choose her own hairstyle.  You did what was right for your daughter", "NTA\n\nI was allowed to make my own decisions about my hair when I was about ten, and I have always loved to experiment with it\n\nYour hair is a pretty big part of you, and you shouldn\u2019t be forced to do something with it, that bothers you that much", "If your daughter was 8, I might think contacting the other parent would make sense,  but at 14, your daughter should have autonomy over her physical being- including her hair. \n\nFemininity is not about hair .

Setting some limits is reasonable when they are younger, but less and less as they get older.", "NTA\n\nSo many mothers feel such a weird sense of ownership over their daughter's hair. You did the right thing in supporting your daughter. She will remember who supported her and that support is invaluable.", "NAH without info. \n\nYour daughter is allowed to have a say in her own image and you're a good dad fighting for her body autonomy. \n\nSome cultures take voting hair EXTREMELY seriously. I'm Native American and I hear about this stuff and it causing extreme issues in the culture all the time. I understand why she's upset that it was done without talking to her, but I have a feeling she would've said no. \n\n\nUltimately, I'm proud of you for listening to and supporting your daughter", "NTA. This isn't about your daughters hair,  its about the fact you gave your daughter control over her own person and the ex doesn't like it. Continue to stand up for your daughter. She will appreciate you all the more for it.", "NTA. Hair does not a woman make. Thank you for giving your daughter autonomy of her body. Thank you, thank you, thank you.", "The child is 14, not 4. If she wants her hair dyed all colours of the rainbow she should get it.\nI wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't want to go to her mother anymore and cut all contact.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAs a *general* rule, these things should be discussed between spouses. If there's a true impasse, then I think you default to the person who does *not* want the thing to happen until it reaches a critical point. Unilateral action by separated parents is a recipe for conflict. Parental conflict is worse for kids than having slightly too long hair.\n\n*However:* \n\na) your child is old enough to do what they want with their hair and made it clear they want to do what you offered, \n\nb) you *have* had discussions with your ex before about this and know their position, \n\nc) it *has* reached a critical point (child crying in their room probably counts! And if not, then certainly because her *hair is down to her knees*), and \n\nd) your ex's position on this is entirely tied to irrational and sexist views about women and their bodies.\n\nCultural views of hair should be treated carefully by folks who aren't members of that culture. While I don't think anybody gets to impose their culture on another person, including a 14 year old, these views are often really more about the type of hair that those of that culture's predominant ethnicity have. For instance, if my wife an I separated, I'd default to my wife's opinion on my sons' hair cuts - *to a point -* since she's black, and their hair texture is closer to hers than mine. She knows more. However, were they old enough to have reasonable views and were very clear in their expression of them, and were those views different from my wife's, then I - after trying to cooperatively work it out with my wife - *would* take them to a barber. I'd probably make sure it was a black barber, or somebody who knew black hair, but I'd eventually reach a point where I would act unilaterally if my wife refused to budge and it was causing emotional damage to my children. You're way past that point even if these considerations *are* present. \n\nAnd this doesn't sound like a hair care issue for your ex. It sounds like a pure values thing - sexist values.

Everyone who grew up IFB has known people like that, but they're also generally looked at sideways a little. There are very few churches that teach that--instead it's families, and those families often drift from IFB church to IFB church in an area because none of the churches quite meet their satisfaction.\n\nIt's a weird world, but one I'm pretty familiar with since that's where I grew up, though not in one of the really crazy families.", "Pentecostal", "I had to put mine in a French braid every night.", "None of my cats play with my hair, but they accidentally (or intentionally, weirdos) eat it all the time. We learned this because our girl will sometimes come flying out of the litter box with a piece of poop still attached to her by one of my hairs \ud83d\ude2b", "I leave mine my natural shade of red most of the time (but blue tips sometimes, often right before a cut, so hey on that!) and old women specifically have shit boundaries about it", "My mom had me with short hair due to a desire not to deal with it and her own desire not to have long so I feel while she should have asked me what I wanted, in the end it wasn't intended as a jealous thing.", "OMG, the images in my head now... Excuse me, gonna go laugh and vomit for a while...", "I feel like there is a unique fundraising idea hiding in here... :D", "How much have you been around the Fundamental Baptist movement?\n\nIt is not the norm in IFB churches, but everyone who has grown up in IFB churches has seen families that do that stuff drift in and out of their churches.", "This common enough that looking for it is a standard part of the algorithm to assess a preverbal infant who is crying.  \"Hair tourniquet\" around a penis or a toe.  Some emergency departments will keep a bottle of Nair to dissolve it.  \n\nPost partum, women shed a lot of hair, and it ends up all over the place.", "People are so weird sometimes", "I go to an independent Baptist church. No one is like that at my church. Now there is a family that came from a small town out in the Midwest and the husband doesn\u2019t allow his wife to wear pants. But families with super traditional and antiquated ways of thinking like that in those denominations are the exceptions not the rule", "Toxic femininity", "Better than stripping her of her autonomy!", "I strongly disagree.  If he had discussed it with her beforehand, you JUST KNOW momma is going to come over to his house and try to take their daughter home.\n\nIt's best to tell crazy people after the fact.", "Culture is just peer pressure from dead and doesn't give you right to bully others", "I think one of the things I learned from AITA that surprised me the most was how often people will go straight to social media or to a group chat to call their family members and friends out (semi-)publicly.", "If I had an award I'd give it to you for making me giggle in work. Take my poor man's gold \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "This guy bibles!", "Given her age, her preferences should", "I\u2019m not sure where you live but in most US states, your daughter is old enough to choose or at least influence custody. I hope you live somewhere where she can have a say.", "They are still legally married.", "Can u not read.....I said they're old enough to decide.... unfortunately she is irrelevant as they are a MINOR and LEGALLY don't get that choice", "Bahahahha omg. This! Spot on \ud83c\udfaf", "Those pilgrims have a PHONE?!", "Safe bet they're Pentecostal Christians. Paul (who never met Jesus in person) goes on a rant about women's roles and the length of believers' hairstyles in 1st Corinthians 11:3-15. A disproportionate part of their religion is based on this one paragraph.", "This is not true. You can definitely go to court for custody even if you\u2019re still married but no longer together, especially because they live in separate houses.", "that may not be true. it's possible that they have been separated long enough to be considered divorced depending on the state they live in", "I mostly think \"damn that's a lot of work\"", "I think that's a little overly judgemental in a thread about letting people be in control of their own hairstyles. As long as they have good hygiene it really doesn't matter.", "Wow, rude. Nobody asked your opinion.", "I think it's beautiful but I'd think the same about anyone with hair that long, regardless of gender.\n\nThen, after half a second of 'oh how pretty', I start thinking about how impractical and uncomfortable it would be. I can admire the dedication, at least.", ">wash the feet of her husband in heaven\n\nThat's gotta be a male fantasy. What woman would really, in her heart, would want to go there. Like the suicide bombers thinking they're gonna get to rape 72 virgins in heaven, we have to ask what horrible crime those virgins had committed.", "Thank you! He\u2019s conjugating verbs as if the word \u201chair\u201d is plural. That makes logical sense, because hair is made of many individual hairs, but English is not logical. One hair, two hairs, one head of hair.", "Double French or Dutch braids are very helpful for this. Spreads the weight out, keeps things tidy. Sleep with a bonnet and they stay neat for a couple days.", "I got my hair cut very short recently. I\u2019m paraplegic, stay in bed a lot. Long hair tangles, breaks, it\u2019s just incompatible with being bedbound *for me.* People who can manage long hair and are bedbound, may the hair gods continue to bless you! \u2764\ufe0f \n\nAnyway, I got it buzzed on the sides (fun to pet, it\u2019s soft and fuzzy!) and it\u2019s longer on top so it curls a bit. I also bleached it and dyed it a gorgeous dark blue with purple undertones after I got home. I\u2019m pushing 50, for reference. If I\u2019m gonna be a blue haired old lady then I\u2019m gonna pick my shade of blue and rock it. \n\nMy mom took one look at me on FaceTime and said I looked like a refugee from a lesbian gym teacher convention. Now Mom\u2019s recently joined a new church, has grown her hair out down to her thighs and started dressing in clothes last in fashion when Laura Ingalls was a kid. She sent me a text message by accident calling for Jebus to come back so that god\u2019s kingdom takes the good people and sorts out the sinners. Pretty sure it\u2019s a cult but I digress. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a reason my mom and I are very low contact and that she\u2019s usually on an information diet. \n\nI love my hair. My husband thought the style was cute when he saw it. The color suits me. Moms who hate short hair can go kick rocks and then go pound sand.", "I had breast cancer and lost all my hair. I thought the best it ever looked was when it was a super-short pixie length when it was growing out (I had many haircuts to shape it, mostly at the barbers, for the first 6 months-1 year, because they rock short cuts and are much cheaper!). It's still fairly short.\n\nI get embracing the short <3", "The daughter\u2019s agency matters more. She\u2019s a teenager.  It was the style she picked.", "I think their point was that 90% of the women you see with hair like that are Mormon or something and don\u2019t actually wear their hair like that because they enjoy it but rather out of social pressure. It\u2019s basically a uniform in a lot of circles and it\u2019s depressing because it\u2019s so much unnecessary work.", "Mom and family were 'upset' to the point Lilly felt the need to *leave their house* and return to stay with her dad because of what they were saying to her.\n\nIf you get 'upset' enough to harass a 14 yo out of her own home, you're not fit to have custody. THAT is the issue.", "It's the main reason I'm estranged from my mother. It's a thing and it sucks.", "Um, actually, \"Fundamentalism\" is named after \"The Fundamentals\", a series of pamphlets and essays collated into a multi-volume collection. The Fundamentals described a kind of Christianity that started with their conservative morality and worked backwards toward the Bible. They included many concepts that, until their inclusion in The Fundamentals, did not even rise to the level of doctrine. For instance, the Rapture was not even 100 years old when The Fundamentals espoused it as Truth.\n\nLiteralism was touched on, but not codified, in The Fundamentals. It wasn't until 1978 in the *Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy* that a formal doctrine was adopted by any major denomination.", "Maybe not, but her choice was still ugly and selfish, sorry. I can\u2019t say brushing my daughters longish hair after she\u2019s slept in it wet and it\u2019s a tangled mess is my favorite task, but she loves it so I lovingly brush it and put it in French braids by request. Who cuts their child\u2019s hair because THEY feel like it or like it that way or are too lazy to maintain it? Ugh", "my kids are grown and both have short hair! LOL", "That\u2019s not borderline child abuse, that is child abuse. Controlling everything your child does and limiting their experience in making decisions only results in fearful people that won\u2019t stand up for themselves and other people in the world will use and abuse them. Narcissism is a helluva drug.", "In most countries 14 is old enough to speak in court and give their opinion on where they would like to live. Keep pushing for what is best for her.", "What is three crowns in relation to hair?", "My guess is India/Pakistan.", "[https://imgur.com/a/BVKEm4o](https://imgur.com/a/BVKEm4o)here is a pic of a double.", "So rude! Why couldn\u2019t she simply say- I prefer it long\u2019? Instead she wants to hurt her daughter\u2019s feelings. So cruel.", "Makes more sense if you read feet washing as a euphemism... Just saying.", "Braids help with limiting loose hairs/getting caught and with the pressure it puts on the scalp! A French braid is apparently best, but braiding helps in general. I hate brushing my hair though, it\u2019s a hassle and a half. I usually hold my hair in my hand and brush everything out under the scalp/my hand first and then start brushing higher up. I used to cry so much as a kid when my parents would do it because they would just go ham on it when brushing \ud83d\ude43 I feel your pain", "Would that be white skinned blue eyed Jebus?", "Thanks that was really my main point. Though when hair gets that long it\u2019s also very hard to maintain and keep looking healthy. I\u2019ve only ever seen it with a foot of split ends and super thin. I just hate the idea of a young woman having to walk around with a yard of dead hair on her head just for some religious BS", "Okay...i braid my (past my waist length) hair at night....ngl, I've used the plait to hit itchy spots on my back (that I can't reach).", "Heh, wait til she finds out he was Jewish. \ud83d\ude04", "My mom\u2019s rule was once we started taking care of our hair on our own, we could wear it as long as we wanted.", "I\u2019m so sorry, you didn\u2019t deserve a mother like that and I hope you\u2019ve begun healing and finding support elsewhere friend"]}
