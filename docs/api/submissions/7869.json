That boundary not gonna magically disappear \ud83e\udee4", "The older sister muscling in is completely out of order And quite vindictive. \n\nWho knows what the guy did or didn\u2019t do - certainly not the OP who had to look him up In faceboom to get hold of him to sneak her tale to.  She didn\u2019t really give a damn about this guy - or his arbitrary rules,  she just wanted to stick it to her sister and found a seemingly plausible way to do it that gullible and judgemental people feel is somehow ok. \n\nFour years difference between partners is in fact NOT a huge age gap as you will undoubtedly find out In due course and maybe not being 100% honest about your work life is a reason for you to break up, but the issue here is not that they might have broken up - it is that one self- righteous opinionated judgemental individual took it upon themselves to get in the middle of it and deliberately try to smash the relationship to pieces.  \n\nShe actively wanted to destroy her sister\u2019s relationship beccause she judged it, and her sister to be not good enough. That\u2019s what she set out to achieve and she succeeded - Who does that To their own flesh and blood?   \n\n\nThat is some nasty level holier-than-thou attitude going on and says to me that the younger sister would be better off without the elder in her life - because every single time she comes up short in any way the elder sister is going to justify her deliberate acts of sabotage in a similar way.   \n\n\nStone throwing is a nasty occupation - and no-one is without sin so they should be very wary of the rebound and also consider taking a long hard look in the mirror. Is she truly without any blemish or less than perfect action at all times, are you, are any of us?  I think not.", "I have yet to see or have roaches thankfully, husband grew up on the east coast and was putting all our cups in the cupboard upside down and doing other strange things in the kitchen. Asked him why, all he said was roaches. \ud83d\ude05 We were living in a new apartment building on the fourth floor\u2026when we moved to a townhouse we had a grand total of two mice which the cat caught and scared the shit out of me with.", "Yup.
