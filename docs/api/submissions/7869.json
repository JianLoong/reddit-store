Furthermore, who tg starts a relationship with such a huge lie. You helped Rob dodge the bullet that is your sister. All the people stains Y T A are children who lie about their age, probably to try and hook up with older people.", "NTA. Frankly from the \u201ctake care of me\u201d comments it sounds like you saved this guy from a babytrap.", "NTA. I don't understand people like your sister. If she just wanted to get laid, no lying would be needed. If she wanted an actual relationship, it would end as soon as her lie was discovered. Did she think at all?", "NTA, I'd want to know if I was dating someone way too young for me. You saved the guy some time. Age isn't something you should lie about in a relationship.", "NTA. Lying about your age is red flag material and  maintaining that lie over the years will at some point become impossible. Rob is out here trying to find mature people, your sister is clearly not that.", "NTA can\u2019t be having people fibbing like", "NTA\n\nWould you want to be told if Your boyfriend is lying to you?\n\nPeople that are dishonest depends on other people minding their business and not telling the truth to the people they are lying to.", "NTA, he would've found out eventually, so it goods you told him now so he's not wasting his time with a liar.", "NTA. Informed consent is a thing. He has boundaries and preferences, and she violated them, and his trust, by lying to get around it. If she's mad, oh well, it's her own damn fault for not respecting this dude.", "NTA, her relationship was based on a lie and he deserved to know, as long as you're fine with not having a relationship with your sister, I don't see anything wrong here.", "NTA. Your sister is behaving immaturely and not respecting other people's boundaries. I think it was too much to look for him online and tell him, but he deserved to know.", "NTA", "NTA, your sister actions put her into the position of getting broken up with. She point blank lied to this man and broke his trust in her. Without trust a relationship will not survive.", "NTA you already tried to confront and told her to tell him and she told you she wanted him to take care of her. Sorry but your sister needs a serious reality check", "NTA but, personally, I would have talked to her first. That's really just what I would do, though, you were in no way obligated to do that.

She was going to get caught and it was going to blow up in her face. And because it was most certainly going to come out before he did anything serious like get married, you were kind of the asshole for wading in. It's a gray area but you didn't know the guy, hadn't even met him and you had to internet research him to even get his info.

If she had the chance to come clean she might have come to understand the personal responsibility. Now she\u2019s just mad at you.", "ESH.  Dude deserved to know but is your relationship with your sister worth some random guy?", "ESH except Rob. Your sister shouldn't have lied, but the way you handled it could have be done better. You should have told your sister that she needed to tell him and if she wouldn't do it, you would do it. That way Rob still gets the truth while you are not going behind your sisters back.", "I'm unclear why you thought it was your duty to track down a guy you don't know to reveal a truth to him. Your sister shouldn't have lied about her age, true, but why did you feel the need to invest yourself personally in something that really had nothing to do with you? I'm guessing you are jealous of or don't like your very sister much. Right or wrong,  it wasn't any of your business.", "YTA because you should have been concerned that your sister was dating someone a decade older than her when she's barely an adult. Not upset about some lie that would have quickly been found out.", "Why did you do that? It's not your business! That crap was between them, not you & him.\n\nYTA", "ESH \n\nMaya sucks for lying to Rob about her age and what she does. \n\nYou suck for looking him up and messaging him about Maya. \n\nRob sucks less for having a rule about not saying under a certain age.", "YTA. That was your sister. Your jealousy is obvious.", "YTA. If your sister were underaged and lying about her age, you would have been justified. But you interfered in an adult's relationship. He would have found out eventually.", "ESH.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister was lying and manipulating. Not ok\n\nBut \"Rob deserves to know\"? Nah, you don't even know Rob. You heard her bragging and wanted to take her ego down a notch. Maybe you think your sister doesn't \"deserve\" a Rob, with his good paying job and property ownership. You were being catty.\n\nI will agree that ending this relationship was for the best all around, but you weren't noble hearted.", "YTA why do you hate your sister? That\u2019s her business. She told you because she trusted you.", "A bunch of busybodies here thinks they  get to be decider of the moral high ground.\n\nWhat happened to mind your business? \n\nThe only justification here is that you are jealous of your sister (the way you describe her man is unequivocally admiration) and decided to end it for her.\n\nMind your f ucking business! And get a life, too. I can't believe you TRACKED HIM DOWN.  You had nothing else to do, that day?\n\nYou lost your sister,  but again, I don't think you care. It's clear that you don't love her.\n\nYou being a snitch is worse than her lying to HER man.\n\nShake my f ucking head.\n\nStay out of people business. You don't get to judge. Who do you think you are. \n\nMind your business and you are an A$$hole and the worst sister to top it off.", "Yta, it wasn't your information to divulge.", "YTA. The lies would\u2019ve come out eventually and instead of being able to be there for her and help her to learn from it, you were the cause of her pain. What she did wasn\u2019t right, but neither was yours. You should\u2019ve just told her that if he asked, you wouldn\u2019t lie for her.", "YTA", "It was wrong of your sister to do that for sure, but you aren't your sisters keeper. If you knew and were friends with Rob that would be one thing, or even letting it slip to your mutual friend and having it accidentally make its way back to him, but it's not your job to police your adult sister's relationship or morals. \n\nI think you did the \"right\" thing, but you were probably the tattletale nobody liked in school. \n\nYTA, not your circus - not your monkeys.", "YTA.", "YTA because you should've kept out of it. \n\nYou sound rather self-righteous about it, like you couldn't wait to look Rob up on social media and spill the beans. You sound quite pleased with yourself.\n\nThe impression I have is of someone thrilled that she had the chance to humiliate her sister, and can justify it to herself as something she had the \"right\" to do.\n\nYou should've kept out of it. You could've told yr sister it was wrong to lie to Rob, that she was only making more trouble for herself by doing so, and he'd eventually find out anyway. You could even have said that if Rob asked you directly, you weren't going to lie, you'd tell him the truth. But to rush right out like that to tell Rob? YTA.\n\nDon't be surprised if yr sister doesn't trust you again.", "ESH except Rob. She shouldn't have lied to him, so she sucks, but she wasn't actively causing him harm with her lie so you really aren't justified in screwing over your sister for a stranger and you suck.", "YTA. You had no right to tell Rob anything. You just wanted to spite your sister.", "YTA. You don\u2019t even know that man! There is no legal issue with her age. Her age difference and \u201coccupation\u201d are no threat to him. They aren\u2019t getting married tomorrow. There was absolutely no reason for you to intervene. It was spiteful and unsisterly.", "Soft YTA- She didn\u2019t respect his boundaries but I don\u2019t think it was your place to go out of your way and tell him that.

And even more concerning is the age \u2014 how long was she going to pretend she\u2019s four years older than she is? Was she going to make sure he never accidentally sees her license? Whenever I have a drs appointment, they ask my name and birthday to verify my identity. Was she never going to have him around for any appointments?
