So your boyfriend said doesn't have feelings for you.  So you go out and bang the first dude that comes along.  And then you tell your ex right away just to rub it in his face.  Don't lie.

Your ex, however, is not being unreasonable. \n\nThe thing is you care about this person, and you sound like you still want to be with him. Regardless of how much you are pretending, you slept with another guy and told him to make him jealous. This was not smart. Regardless of how poorly he treated you, you still want him and sleeping with someone days after you broke up will make him never want you again. Please do not mistake his anger for interest, or think he actually likes you. His ego was just bruised, which has nothing to do with you. \n\n This same situation happened to my coworker. His ex, who he was still \"friends,\" with, slept with another man and told him. Just like your ex, he blocked her. He actually never spoke to her again, so I hope you are ready for that. At the very least, he will never date you seriously again.", "NTA.  Sounds like he had more feelings than he lead on to.

You chose to have sex, you aren't in any relationship, that's that. \n\nThat being said, telling your ex partner that is a bit insensitive, especially if they never asked.\n\nGoing off your original question \"AITA for having sex while single?\" No, you are not an asshole and your ex needs to get a grip considering he ended things. \n\nFor (what I assume was out of blue) telling him you had sex so early after, very soft YTA morale wise.", "Say it with me:\n\n#WE WERE ON A BREAK!\n\nNTA (and neither was Ross).", "Read the first line and knew you was a female without reading the rest, you clearly told him to see how he would react.", "If you had sex right after a break up it shows YOU DID NOT CARE ABOUT HIM  \n\nHe made the right choice, you proved him right you are the ass", "ESH.

He\u2019s definitely not going to be ur best friend for much longer \u2014 it never works that way after a breakup (or, at least, it takes a lot of time to fix \u2014 especially when one or both parties is hurt.)

YTA", "Soft YtA but he deserved it", "YTA. Not for having sex but for telling him. Doesn't matter what he said about not having feelings for you. It's a jerk move to tell someone just a few days after breaking up with them that you've already hooked up with someone. Even if they don't have feelings for you, it's not weird to be hurt by that.

He\u2019s trying o keep you at arms length in a FWB type set up when you clearly wanted more. That\u2019s why he\u2019s upset with you.\n\nHowever bragging to your ex of only a few days that you hooked up with someone else is at best a tone-deaf insensitive move, at worst you\u2019re trying to rub it in his face that you hooked up with someone else so quickly after the \u201cbreak up\u201d. \n\nThis is a recipe for a toxic \u201con again, off again\u201d cycle.

It was obviously to elicit a response.", "YTA- but not for why you are framing it. \n\nFine, you broke up, good call. \n\nThen, you send him info that you screwed somebody else? Why? What is the point of that? Then you act surprised that this pissed him off? Also - why?\n\nYTA - for trying to make him jealous and it working and you acting all innocent about it.", "YWBTA..  \n\nIdk why women feel the need to tell their ex's about their sex lives like if it's not possible that person still have feelings for you and it can hurt. It happened to me when I clearly was making advances and she was responding to them only for her not to take them seriously than discuss her hookup with me like \"oh yeah that's a cool idea after our 5 year painfully relationships ere you lead me on and switched up, cheated numerous times and say it will get better just to decide I'm not worth it and you're sorry for stringing me along.\"  But that's my fault. Fool me once. \n\nSecondly, idk many guy friends who like to hear those kinds of things, esp when they have feelings or just want to be friends. I've seen a lot of guys lose respect for women like this. Is it valid? Probably not. Maybe sometimes depending on the situation. \n\nYou would've been the asshole completely if he had never said \"I'm not interested and I don't want to be with you. I have no feelings.\" Dude clearly had a reason for breaking it off like that, sounds like it wasn't worth the ends now he's paying for it. \n\nOP, the only thing you did wrong was discuss your sex life with your ex. It's not a smart move regardless if you're friends. It's not a smart move to discuss with male friends who probably have feelings for you. \n\nAnd as a male, it's often annoying to hear other males successful hookups like I really don't care and it's annoying n gross shut up.  So it probably goes both ways, boy to girl, girl to girl or boy to boy. \n\nTldr YKTA but not really, don't discuss your bedroom life with ex's regardless of \"friend\" status let alone anyone unless they're okay with it. Rule of thumb tho, don't discuss that with your ex. \n\nClearly, you just wanted a friend who you could talk too about stuff.", "YTA.\n\n\nOf course you can have sex while single.\n\n\nBut you're an ass for breaking up with him and then telling him about it.

Wow, he kinda did care a bit, or had his ego hurt, or was lying. So ESH.\n\n\nAlso, leaving that guy aside, maybe show a little more care and love for yourself?
