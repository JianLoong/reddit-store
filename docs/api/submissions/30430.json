And let me tell you, no one in our family cared. So I am telling you what you know is true: your family (mostly your siblings) isn\u2019t into this holiday dinner and may be relieved to not have to go if you stopped hosting. Oh, your family isn\u2019t into each other, either, and wouldn\u2019t care if they didn\u2019t see each other. I know you want a picture perfect Norman Rockwell holiday, but your family doesn\u2019t really care. I should\u2019ve learnt this when my family members would bring a couple of cans of green beans and tell me to \u201cheat it up in the microwave\u201d when they were asked to bring a dish. We stopped hosting and now we go out of town during the holidays and no one gives a damn.", "You are not \u201cruining the holidays.\u201d  You are opting not not to host.\n\nPresumably there are other adults in your family and someone else can volunteer if having a family get together is a priority.\n\nI\u2019d send a message out that unfortunately you\u2019re not hosting this year so want to give everyone plenty of time to make alternate plans.\n\nEdit/spelling", "NTA\n\nI'm sure that over the years you have experienced pressure from your family to host, and over time your family has taken it for granted that you host.\n\nSimply communicate that you can't this year, no further explanation needed.\n\n>If I just stop all together, I know my parents would not see the grandkids for the holidays.\n\nSince you write that your parents are well off, I'm sure that they can spare some money for a trip to visit their grandchildren. If they don't do it, it's because they don't have the will to do it, and at that point, why make the effort? It's their problem.", "A quick edit: my husband is actually very supportive but I know he isn't a huge fan of these dinners. And he will always back me no matter what and even if I am wrong. He is loyal to me to a fault. So I need neutral opinions!", "NTA\n\nYou're not \"ruining Christmas\" by not hosting for once. It was very nice of you to do it all those years, but they can't just expect you to always do it. You paid a lot of money for them all these years, and their idea of fair is that you have to chip in for take-out? When you'd be having them in your house, too, and would probably still have work with preparing and cleaning up. If they want a big family Christmas party, one of them can host for a change.", "NTA, for the longest time, my family (aka. my parents) hosted family Christmas with my mother's huge side of family (like 30 people).\n\nBut food was always paid by my grandparents, because it was there wish to have a big family celebration together.\n\nstill it was a lot of work preparing everything and my siblings and I always helped a lot.\n\nSo it's completely understandable, that you burned out and unfair of your family to expect you to pay for everything.\n\nJust have a nice small Christmas with your husband & kids and forget about your family. They don't deserve your kindness \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nJust don\u2019t host. If your parents don\u2019t see their grandkids, that\u2019s on them. You aren\u2019t responsible for that. They want to see all the kids at one location, they dip into they 7 figures.", "NTA. The others could also host. Or pay for a nice vacation for the whole family. You have money problems and you hosted this event for so long. Tell them in a group chat or so, that you can't do it this year, but you hope some of your siblings could host so you all can see each other.", "NTA\n\nThis is the time to pull back and do for your family and not extended family and take care of yourself. If you're burned out (and who wouldn't be with all that going on??), you need to prioritize your own health.\n\nIt sucks but your extended family has made it clear that they're only interested in seeing you and your kids at your expense. When you set a boundary, they reacted like users do. \n\nTrust me, you are better off with less involvement with people like this. They might be genetically related, but they don't seem to act like family. Maintaining your boundaries around this also sets a good example for your kids.", "NTA.  If they want the get together so badly, they can host, or pay for a restaurant.  \n\n2 jobs and 3 kids is more than enough reason to not have the energy to do it, money need not be mentioned.", "NTA. Just because everybody else is too lazy to take on the chore of putting on Christmas festivities doesn't mean that you have to. Your duty isn't greater than anybody else's. If your parents don't want to pay for takeout after having you host for many years, maybe they just don't deserve to see the grandkids this year? Or maybe it just isn't that important to them. Not all people are attached to their relatives. Maybe some of the grandkids will want to visit their grandparents regardless? For this year, just take a step back and let festivities fall where they are dropped. Maybe everything will find a more affordable level, both with regards to money and effort. This is not something you MUST do, it is something you have chosen to do for a number of years, and now you just do not feel like doing it any more.", "NTA, it is time to make different kind of Christmas memories and traditions, I wish you a peaceful Christmas \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA\n\nYou aren't ruining Christmas they are.   Why not suggest to them that they host it for a change?  If they are that well off I would expect they have the house to be able to do it.  I expect they would continue to show their true colours and wouldn't want to do it and like you taking all the responsibility.", "Take a year off and relax", "NTA\n\nNo is a sentence.\n\nStand your ground", "NTA don\u2019t host have a quiet lil family holiday you will love it!", "Can you not do a potluck where everyone brings a dish?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m just not getting their problem and what was said to you after you refused to host is messed up. Idk if I would care so much about my siblings opinion though, especially if I wasn\u2019t even friends with them. Maybe they should chip in? Either way this is not on you. They are all adults and can figure this out if it\u2019s what they want.", "So... your parents sound horrible, are you trying to hold on for the hope of inheritance?\n\nNTA. Anybody can host if they want this. You have done your time for 20 years, and seem to be getting zero appreciation for that effort. Your parents could rent somewhere if they cared to see their grandchildren, they have made clear they do not care enough to even swing for take away so not your problem.\n\nRemember no is a complete sentence. \"I will not be hosting this year. If someone else wants to host, we may be able to attend.\" Leave it at that. Don't even answer questions on why, and dont invite solutions that leave you hosting.", "NTA, let your parents host and you just come to visit.", "NTA-but you handled it SO WRONG. STOP making alternate suggestions. The first thing you did is suggest someone else host? Why? All you do is tell everyone that you are not planning to host this year. Don\u2019t say you aren\u2019t \u201cable\u201d. Don\u2019t give a myriad of reasons. Just say NO. I don\u2019t understand why we see this \u201cdilemma\u201d a thousand times. When you offer suggestions, alternate arrangements, put limits on their solutions, you are being indirect and then getting mad that they aren\u2019t reading your mind. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want people to know about your financial limitations, DON\u2019T TELL THEM. You essentially did exactly that by asking your parents to pay for take out. \n\nThis entire thing would have been fine if all you had done was send out a mass family text that you are not PLANNING to host this year and ignore EVERY question as to why. They would have immediately switched to figuring out an alternate plan.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t realize their own level of control. You have agency. Use it.", "NTA.

It's always felt like me trying to keep the family together and parents happy, and no one else cares. I am willing to bet they would rather not have the hours and hours (some 4 hours each way) of driving to go. \n\nThese people don't care about me. I don't even have them on IG or FB or have their emails. I have more contact with former coworkers who still ask about the kids and chat on FB. \n\nI just finally am ready to call it, and then I end up being told I'm all these horrible things.

I firmly believe they don't like me, we are all strangers.\n\nThis is the one day a year we see each other and talk. \n\nWhich makes doing this weird Christmas dance even more uncomfortable. Hosting people who don't care about me at all to please other people who are too selfish to help. \n\nI am the only daughter so I have always felt both leaned upon for these things but also alone within the family", "There are 3 siblings and my parents. Parents will only ever offer to bring bread or buns (not kidding. That is their limit on all pot lucks).

Live Ina  tiny tiny 800sq ft bungalow with no dining space. One open eating/kitchen/living. \n\nI think I have always been viewed as the failure of the family amongst a bunch of bright stars, and they are judgey, and I just can't take the talk I know they will spread to all extended family.", "I hold on because all I have ever wanted is a loving family like I see others have. \n\nI don't expect any inheritance. Due to my own health matters and with my luck I will pass before them anyways ;) haha.", "To be clear, I have no contact and no means of communication with siblings except through my parents. I do not have their emails, numbers, or have them on my Socials. My parents do not have cells and I don't have cell numbers of siblings, so a mass text wouldn't be an option. \n\nWhich in itself should be telling to me that I only speak to these people once a year. \n\nSo I did speak to my parents directly and them only, making these suggestions, hoping they would not tell others and would see this as a fair reasonable option to this year. Either they ask someone else do it and say it would be nice for a change, which they can ask about (I tried in previous years mentioning it at the dinner that next year someone else should, but it was always shot down), or parents could pay for takeout as it's not just about money, but also time. \n\n\nAs the only daughter, there seems to be very different expectations on me which I have carried my whole life. To keep the family together, to care for parents, take them to dr appointments, help out more. I have enabled it too long and I see that now, but it's also very generational and cultural and ingrained into me. So there is a lot there beyond just saying No and being done. There will be major fallout for me. I may just have to accept that.", "Ah I see. Hell with it then! If they want their holiday so damn bad they can loosen up their pockets and rent an Airbnb close by that will fit everyone. It\u2019s sad they\u2019re prioritize not spending over seeing the family/kids. Out of curiosity and if you don\u2019t mind my asking, what festivities does your husband hate so much?

You don't deserve the financial burden & unappreciated stress.", "Lol I just mean the whole thing. The chaos of Christmas presents and unwrapping and the massive food and non stop talking and noise. He is from a very WASPy type family that did not celebrate holidays and is used to a very quiet calm life. He isn't comfortable in these big loud social settings... especially when he can't escape by making an excuse and leaving early. Lol"]}
