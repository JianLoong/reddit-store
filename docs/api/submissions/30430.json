Oh, your family isn\u2019t into each other, either, and wouldn\u2019t care if they didn\u2019t see each other. I know you want a picture perfect Norman Rockwell holiday, but your family doesn\u2019t really care. I should\u2019ve learnt this when my family members would bring a couple of cans of green beans and tell me to \u201cheat it up in the microwave\u201d when they were asked to bring a dish.

You paid a lot of money for them all these years, and their idea of fair is that you have to chip in for take-out?

That also is not on you. \nI am so puzzled by the extra burdens women voluntarily take on - especially for the holidays - and for what? \nNTA", "NTA at all.\n\nI have a big family. In the past, one of my older siblings used to host the Christmas dinner for all of us and has done all the cooking etc. A few years ago we changed the tradition, as we became more than 20 family members (siblings, children, nephews, nieces, grandchildren\u2026). Now each of us brings something different (food,desserts, snacks, drinks etc.) to her place. Nobody has to cook all day and spend much money for.", "NTA, give yourself a break and if the family decides only you can do this or the holidays don't happen then let them not happen. From the sounds of it you won't be missing much and will boost your own mental health. NTA.", "NTA Have your parents ever heard of restaurants, hotels, cruises and resorts?", "NTA you\u2019re justified to not host even without the cost", "NTA. You should listen to your husband, he is right on this one. Your immediate family is your priority. If this dinner was important to your extended family, someone else would have hosted it. If your parents will try to make you feel bad, they should host it. If nobody else does, then nobody else cares or they should not havecan opinion on it. Christmas only with close family is really nice. And peaceful.", "I come from a large family and my parents used to host Christmas. And man, it was a Project, an expensive project. I get the hassle of hosting Christmas. But circumstances change, and so will the way we celebrate Christmas. Under no circumstances allow your parents or siblings guilt you about not hosting them. Since you don't have their emails or socials, ignoring their complaints should be easy. \n\nAlso, I think you should be honest about the reasons you can't host. 'Sorry, can't host this year due to costs'. There isn't, and shouldn't be, any shame in admitting that you can't afford to do something - especially when your own family's wellbeing is a priority. Again, since you're already LC with your siblings, why should their judgement matter? Is keeping up appearances for someone you see once a year really worth it?\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were being the AH to yourself and your family (husband and kids) by continually hosting and waste money on people who won't help you when asked. Please stop and focus on your family.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur family are AHs,. so you are ruining christmas because you stop letting them exploit you?", "NTA. If no one else wants to do it, don't feel a bit guilty. You have done more than enough. Selfish? Narcissist? etc.? Your family is not even close? Don't sweat this. And you have no obligation to divulge your finances. Your husband can't stand this? Why the heck do you even care about this?  \nAs someone else stated, maybe your family would gladly give up traveling to your home. And if no one wants to host, that might tell you that they don't care if you all get together or maybe they figure  you'll just give in.\n\nWe had a similar situation. For many years, my mother would host my grandparents and her sister and her family. Mom worked a full time job. Sister was an RN but preferred not to work and brought nothing and went home and left all the dishes, etc. After Grandpa died, they didn't come anymore. Aunt told Mom that they never enjoyed coming and that they only came because the kids wanted their presents. You can imagine how Mom felt. My brother, my father and I never liked it either. Thanksgiving with my father's side was another story, LOL.\n\nJust put a stop to this now. Make Christmas special for you, your husband and kids. You have no further obligation to host.", "NTA. And, considering the potential wealth/financials of your parents, well if they really give two shits about seeing the grand kids, they can pony up the cash. To be fair, it sounds like you're well rid of them. Enjoy your home and your immediate family, and be thankful for the lack of noise and headache.", "I am supporting your husband to supporting your rage even more ;)\n\nYou are so NTA, just have a nice family dinner with your husband and kids. It will be so more enjoyable.", "This entire tradition sounds stilted and forced. No one but you seems to be actually committed to it, and no one seems to enjoy it. Including yourself. \n\nIt also sounds like you might be a little to invested in their opinions of you. If you barely have a relationship, why?", "There is nothing to add that hasn't already been said other than to say that your husband sounds adorable. NTA", "PS asking people to split the cost of takeout doesn't indicate that you are struggling. It is just fair.", "Dogs gonna bark, honey. Tell \u2018em to shut their yap holes and leave you alone. You\u2019ve closed the Christmas Restaurant of No Fux Given and intend it to stay that way. I hope you, your husband, and kids have a wonderful holiday free of family assholery.", "You know what this means?\n\nYou can fill your table, your time, and your life with people who value YOU, and WANT to be there. You can build a tradition for your friends and chosen family, and make your family into what you hope for. Teach your kids, gather your friends and celebrate FOR YOU\n\nI know it sucks to realize this, and to have to deal with it, but you seem like a good, strong and caring person, and this difficult time will surely lead you to far more happiness than before", "The family you need to work on keeping together is the three children you have with your husband.\n\nTry having Christmas just the 5 of you and see just how much fun it could be.\n\n\nNTA, overall. But yta to yourself. Are you the oldest by any chance? Or the only daughter? Is that why you feel this responsibility?", "even more reason not to host.", "Send them something in the post, just to make sure you've communicated directly (in case your parents are accidentally confusing messages)", "Darling, I say this with kindness. DROP THE FREAKING ROPE. You\u2019ve done enough. Time to celebrate with your nuclear little family, just the 5 of you. Get a nice takeout and watch some cringy Christmas movies. \n\nNTA", "You have created the loving family you always wanted! I'm impressed by the way you write about your husband, how you always have his full support. There' a reason he feels this way toward you\u2014you can be proud of that. THIS is what you deserve\u2014for the five of you to make your own new easy-going tradition. Five happy people is plenty in this world\u2014best wishes to you!", "I do think you need to get ahold of your siblings' phone numbers one way or another.  Firstly, I found with my own family that communication and relationships were much improved when we were able to speak directly instead of being filtered through someone else's lens. \n\nSecondly, even if you don't want to improve your relationship with your siblings, you should have their number so you can tell them directly that you're not hosting this year.  Again, with your parents doing the messaging, your siblings might get the wrong message, or even not get the message at all, and turn up anyway. \n\nYou're not wrong for not wanting to host but I do think you need to wrestle control of the family communications off your parents.", "The only reason your extended family is yelling at you is because they're going to have to pay for their own Christmas dinners from now on -- no more freebies on your dime.", "I cannot fathom that she has been doing this for TWENTY YEARS. All those turkeys/roasts, side dishes, salads, desserts...I can't imagine how much money that adds up to. \n\nAnd the time investment! All that cleaning before and after, decorating, stressing...the fricking dishes!!\n\nOP is way, way underreacting.", "\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f thank you", "Yeah it's not intentional. I could probably dig up their numbers somewhere or ask my parents. They aren't gatekeeping it. I just have never spoken to them so never really needed it. But yes, having their numbers is a good idea. I think I will just do the mass text saying I'm not hosting this year, and if someone else is up for it, let me know and we will see you there. And leave it at that", "Haha! Totally understandable. I hope someone in your family comes around or if not that you have a great Christmas with just your husband and kids!", "I think that's the best way of doing it.  You'll also probably find outside your parents hysterics that nobody will really be that bothered. You're giving plenty of notice. \n\nYour siblings will just have to argue between them who gets the pleasure of hosting your parents!", "Lol aye there's the rub  \n\nNeither will! My parents won't go anywhere without their two yippy dogs and none of my siblings or their wives will allow these horribly trained dogs in their home \ud83e\udd23 And even though my husband has allergies, and has to take meds anytime they come for dinner or a visit, we still tolerate it \n\nI'm realizing what a doormat I am to them!", "Please get some therapy! It will be life changing..."]}
