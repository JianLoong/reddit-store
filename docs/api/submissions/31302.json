The moments of \u2018magic\u2019 of Santa was something I cherished with my kid. So many laughs and smiles and great memories! He\u2019s 13 and we still play along, although it\u2019s not the same. But it\u2019s still cute. \n\nBut you do you - as long as you and hubby both agree, I don\u2019t see the problem. But what about your 2 yo? What did you do last year with her? So how would you flip it up if you changed your mind?", "I was never ever told that Father Christmas wasn\u2019t real. Whenever I asked my dad, he would just say that he believed in the spirit of Father Christmas. I naturally came to the realisation when I was 14 (I\u2019m autistic) and therefore it wasn\u2019t traumatic at all and I have a lot of happy memories of Father Christmas.\n\nMy siblings are 7 and 8 years older than me and never ruined the spirit of it either", "NTA. Not all religions in the world have a Santa concept. Your kids will survive.", "NTA\n\nI'm with you. IMHO it is not harmless fun at all.\n\nWhat astounds me most is religious parents who tell their kid that the magical being who hands out rewards for good or bad behaviour (Santa) is  fiction, but that the magical being who hands out rewards for good or bad behaviour (God) is real. Eh?", "Tough one. I\u2019ll go with NAH I think. \n\nI\u2019m Dutch, so we celebrate Sinterklaas instead of Christmas. But I think the stories that people spin are very similar. \n\nPersonally, I was TERRIFIED from the idea that someone could sneak into our house at night. Because if they could, couldn\u2019t everyone? The first year I was aware of it, I didn\u2019t sleep the whole season. \n\nThe second year I already started worrying and getting anxious again early November.

Within a week I told all the neighbourhood kids \ud83e\udd72\n\nAs your kid never believed, perhaps it\u2019s not a novelty and therefore she won\u2019t spill the beans to her cousins.

I honestly cannot remember if it was different for the kids around me.\n\nTo me as child, christmas magic was much more the decorating, baking Pl\u00e4tzchen, special christmas music etc. As an adult, it's the planning of the tree decoration and setting up the \"Krippe\". I'm sure you'll find ways t make the holidays special for your kids.\n\nYou do not need a lie to make christmas magic happen and to be honest I don't really get the reason as to why you would talk about a clearly ficitional character as real in the first place. \n\nI was always aware that characters from books, movies, Tv didn't really exist and they still brought - and bring - a lot of joy to my life.", "My dad said 'oh of course santa isn't real..  invented by coca cola.

There is a way to do it that maximises childhood magic and minimises any upset.\n\nThere are issues with poor children not getting presents and all that. I think the best way if you're going to do it is that Santa brings one or two things and the rest are clearly from your family.\n\nI think for the majority of people, Christmas is a magical time. And a lot of that comes from the traditions of childhood. I'm very rational and an atheist. But if a child says to me that a rainbow in the sky is a magical bridge to fairyland, I'm not going to sit them down and explain refraction. Humans love stories. \n\n\nSo if you're not gonna do Santa, do something. Make it magical.", "NAH - I think you may be the type of person who sees the world differently than most of humanity and missed the point of why we have things like Santa (plus the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and countless others). It's two-fold:\n\n1. As your family is pointing out, it gives children that feeling of magic that we adults know doesn't exist in the world, but we all desire to have.\n2. Most kids discover on their own that these things aren't real. The logic errors add up over time (like how the hell does he fit down a chiminy, what is his method of getting into apartments, how does he know who is a Christian). It becomes a right of passage for them in which they graduate into becoming the tradition holder for the younger kids and eventually their own kids. \n\nAt the very least, if you are going to tell your kids from the start that Santa isn't real, you also have to teach them that it is not their place to ruin it for the other kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know. I won't say you're an asshole for doing so but just that you're pushing too much of yourself onto your children. I would understand if you're a religious person and wanted the children to understand the religious aspect of Christmas more than the fun part, but it isn't even that since you're on Reddit and all.

I don't see the issue.", "NTA but your experience of finding out isn't how all children experiences are. My son has finally stopped believing. He isn't traumatized. So take it also not all kids get traumatized because of OMG Santa isn't real. You just need to teach your child some children believe in Santa and that is okay but let's not ruin their fun.

Yes, he\u2019s not a real person.

That spirit is real and it is unbelievable\u2014I would say miraculous\u2014that millions of families still have Santa traditions to keep that spirit alive.

My brother who can be an ass, tells his kids about Santa. We just word our kids up on the way to seeing them around Christmas time that it's not nice to tell other kids that Santa doesn't exist. It's rude and we don't do it. They never have but if they did I wouldn't be telling them off beyond \"that wasn't very nice etc\".\n\nAlso I thoroughly recommend it. I put effort into getting them gifts they like and I get the credit. My husband does nothing with presents and no resentment builds because he tells them, mum did it all not me. I tell them them magic isn't real but that people's brains are amazing. Brains have written stories, like HP and we can use our imagination in our brain to enjoy then. Other things in nature that really happens and there is evidence for is amazing. The world is no less amazing without Santa.

You're doing the right thing, and I think your SIL's harsh judgment is because she is projecting just a bit because she knows that lying to her kids isn't right. Your daughter might tell her cousins that Der Weihnachtsmann isn't real, or maybe one of their classmates or friends will, or maybe they'll figure it out for themselves as kids do.

As early as they're able to articulate the idea, children debate the realness of Father Christmas with each other. I know I was *very* young when I noticed that all the stories about Father Christmas have him and his elves making wooden toys , but what turned up under my tree were Star Wars toys that were definitely the same as the ones in the shops. Your children not being told Father Christmas is real is just another piece of the confusing puzzle about whether or not Father Christmas is real for those children, it's not like anyone is going to take them as the absolute authority.", "Nta\n\nThe only reason to get kids to believe in one magic time wizard is to indoctrinate them into believing in other invisible sky magicians", "YTA\n\nI found out Santa wasn\u2019t real by my step dad yelling at me in the shoe department of Target.

However, with the level of exposure your children will likely experience in school and with friends and family, and their current age, you won't always be there/be able to stop them saying the wrong thing. \n\nBut as far as that and your SIL's concerns, well, the same issue of 'ruining the magic' can occur when there is a difference in age between the children and the elder child decides to tell the younger what they believe is a lie.", "NTA I had a similar reaction about the Tooth Fairy. I really felt betrayed and awful that people I trusted had lied to me and I also felt really stupid that If fallen for it. Who is this 'magic' for? We don't lie to our kids. Not ever. Santa was explained as something that we all work together to make real and that that is the magic of Christmas. And they were fine with that. Sadly we did run into trouble with ours when they got the school system. Eldest found the deep faith of their classmates in Santa made them doubt us. After all, how could everyone else in the class and the teacher be wrong? Youngest had it tougher. It was apparently just fine for bullying six year olds to tell my kid that they didn't get gifts from Santa because they were 'bad' but a suspension offence for mine to retaliate and say Santa didn't bring them anything either because he was something their parents made up.

We did the cookies and had some presents from \u201cSanta\u201d in addition to presents from parents (even as adults sometimes we still do, like if it\u2019s a game for the whole family to play or something), so I never felt like I was missing out on anything, but it was also just never a big deal. Santa was a fun Christmas thing that we just knew wasn\u2019t real, but since it was never a big deal, it was also not something that we told other kids about. Why would we?

We found gifts one year. She told us Santa's sleigh was too small, so he actually dropped off the presents through the weeks before Christmas for the parents to keep hidden, then he just got them out and stuck them under the tree Christmas Eve. We asked why Santa couldn't give us everything we wanted. She told us the gifts weren't free. Santa had expenses - raw materials, elf salaries, etc. -  and parents had to leave him a check to help offset these costs.  I still figured it out by age 5, because Santa never wrapped our gifts. But he wrapped our cousin's gifts - in the very same wrapping paper my aunt used for all the gifts she gave everyone else \ud83d\ude02. But I never shared what I had realized with my brother or cousin or any other child, because I knew that would be rude.  I only told my mother. She just smiled, put her finger to her lips in the \"shhh\" gesture, and winked at me. I didn't feel betrayed, fortunately, just very grown up. \n\nYou are NTA. Make what decision you feel is best for your child and your (nuclear) family. \n\nI told my children from the beginning the legend of St. Nicholas. I explained that at Christmastime, everyone, even the grownups, like to play the \"Santa game\" together - we all pretend that St. Nicholas, a/k/a Santa, brings gifts at Christmas (even though it's really mom and dad). That's why some children get lots of gifts and some not so much - it depends on what their family wants to do and can afford, not whether they're \"good\" or not. \n\nBut it's a Christmas tradition, and it's very special because at this time of year, grown-ups get to play, too. And just like when our friends are playing pretend at any other time, we don't go around and *say* things like \"That's not real\" or \"that's just pretend\", because that spoils the game, and spoils the fun for everyone. \n\nNeither of my kids - one an adult and one a teen - *ever* told anyone Santa wasn't real. They actually loved Santa and insisted on visiting and having pictures made with Santa each year. We hung stockings, left out milk and cookies, and carrots for the reindeer. They wrote letters to Santa - and then asked me to email them to daddy \ud83d\ude01.  When adults asked them what Santa was bringing them for Christmas, they shared an item or two from their wish list. And they still to this day like their gifts to be tagged \"From Santa\", and my husband's are tagged \"To Santa, From Mrs. Claus.\" And when they open them, they've always hugged us and said, \"Thank you, Santa \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffc\". We've had a lifetime of all the fun associated with Santa, but without risking that our children would be upset when learning the truth.", "In our house growing up, we did Santa Claus but honestly it was confusing because my parents especially my dad is German and we celebrated on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day was a day of stockings and family and that\u2019s about it.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how I remembered or learned that my parents were Santa Claus . \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I can\u2019t say I was terribly traumatized I think it was just a rite of passage My parents would joke about the naughty and nice list, but they never threatened to cancel Christmas or tell Santa not to bring gifts or whatever. \n\nLooking back I do know the Johnson kids and the Kennedy kids were threatened that all the time and from Thanksgiving to Christmas they were a bundle of nerves. \n\nMy parents were not overly religious so we never had the story of the baby Jesus bringing a gift or whatever. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole I mean there\u2019s lots of kids whose parents don\u2019t pedal the Santa story. In fact, there\u2019s a lot of religions that don\u2019t even celebrate Christmas. They have other ways of celebrating things in the winter time like Hanukkah and Kwanzaa all that stuff and those kids are fine .\n\nAs long as you and your husband are on the same page, that\u2019s all that matters you know what?

I mean incredibly relieved he said, thank God there\u2019s not a giant man in a tutu in my room, taking my teeth.\n\nSo telling the truth is what it\u2019s all about", "NTA however, from a child development perspective, magical thinking is normal and good. By age 10 most children have the ability to reason things out and come to the conclusion that Santa isn't real. As long as kids don't ruin it for others who do believe I don't see anything wrong with approaching it how you feel is best. We incorporate religion into Santa in that Santa brings 3 gifts because the wise men brought 3 gifts to Jesus.", "NTA. I have a friend who had a similar experience.

I was a bit bewildered when i found out but all the presents i got were still real and i respected my mum who had to save up all year to give me a christmas. I never felt betrayed, i felt honored my mum tried so hard to give me a christmas as a kid and never got any credit because it was \"from santa\"\n\nEvery kid will react differently, if not told by family someone in their class at school is sure to bring it up.
