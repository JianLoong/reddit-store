We broke up several times but we always found a way back to each other. We've been through hell and back and we're more in love now than ever.\n\nMy brother Joey has been with this girl Lana for 5 years and they have 2 kids together. She got pregnant with their first kid only a few months into their casual relationship and they got serious after that. My family and I tolerate her for the kids. She's kind of loud, competitive and self-centered and she copies me all the time because she's jealous I guess.\n\nLast October my fiance finally proposed to me, and a couple months later to everybody's surprise Joey proposed to Lana. He always said that he didn't want to marry her so this totally came out of left field. Lana claimed that they agreed to get married for tax reasons and they were in love too but I call BS. She couldn't stand that I'm getting married first so she forced my brother to propose. \n\nNext she set their wedding date to 1 month after mine to one up me because that's how she is. I thought that was not fair to our guests because some of them live out of town and they can't afford to fly here twice in 1 month for 2 weddings. My mom agreed with me and we went over to Joey's house to talk them into pushing their wedding date out farther. \n\nJoey and Lana got very defensive. Lana said that she always dreamed of a summer wedding and she had the perfect dress for it which was bright white and my mom made an unnecessary comment about how she shouldn't be wearing a white dress. It only pissed off my brother more and he screamed at us. I tried to get them to understand that they already have a wonderful family life... a house, kids, everything and I haven't gotten to start that life with my fiance so the least they could do is let me have my dream wedding in peace without her trying to compete with me. Joey called my relationship a sham and kicked me and my mom out of his house. \n\nJoey and Lana aren't talking to us. They uninvited us to their daughter's birthday party next weekend. I just want us all to live in peace with each other without any competitiveness or ill feelings. I will apologize if I'm wrong.

If she wanted to screw with you, she would have set hers before.", "YTA. Where to begin...\n\n> ...she copies me all the time because she's jealous I guess.\n\nThis is a red flag whenever I hear it. The world doesn't revolve around you, you didn't invent whatever you think she's doing to copy you, and people copy people they admire, not people who dislike them. \n\n>Next she set their wedding date to 1 month after mine to one up me because that's how she is.\n\nHow is this one upping you? They're showing deference to you by scheduling their wedding *after* yours.

Again, this is a reasonable response to your/your mom's behavior. \n\nRight now you sound like the one with a persecution complex who thinks that someone else is planning their life just to ruin yours.

You talk about your SIL in a horrible way and you ascribe all kinds of bad personality traits to her, but that doesn't make them true. They planned the wedding after yours, so you get to have the first. Your mother is out of line with the white dress comment. I assume according to her rules, you probably shouldn't wear one either.", "YTA. Also don\u2019t act like you have a beautiful magical love story that\u2019s so much better than your brother\u2019s love story. The fact is you and your partner have been off again and on again for 7 years, and this time around you are committing to getting married. That\u2019s trashy as hell IMO. \nDon\u2019t get too bitter the next time you two break up and your BIL and SIL are still married.", "YTA\n\nYou call her self-centered? Maybe you should look into a mirror.", "Yeaaaaaa YTA. Do you your thing, let other do theirs. Your post makes you sound just as competitive with her as she supposedly is with you. If someone can't afford to come to both weddings then that is their choice and their responsibility to communicate to the parties but it has nothing to do with you. Instead of making this a fun family year of wedding planning, you're going to cause huge riffs because what, your attention is being stolen? Hopefully you can find a way to be the bigger person and focus on your own party.", "YTA, and your mom\u2019s an asshole to\u2026..seriously according to what you wrote people would be more inclined to attend your wedding as its first and apparently people can\u2019t stand her. I wonder what\u2019s really going on and what she\u2019s actually like because you are the one that seems jealous, maybe it\u2019s because you and your fianc\u00e9 had some rough sailing and they appear to have been smooth sailing after the pregnancy\u2026", "YTA.  You're allowing your dislike of your SIL to affect your judgment.   One month's separation is more than enough time to ensure that the weddings don't impinge on each other.  What's more, if you were really that concerned about family and friends having to come twice for the weddings, you'd have recommended that they be held together or on consecutive days. \n\nYour mother's comment about her daughter in law wearing white is cruel and unjustified. Or are you going to pretend that, strictly speaking, you're entitled to wear white for your own wedding. \n\nI wouldn't blame your brother and sister in law if they didn't go to your wedding,  uninvited you and your mother from their wedding, and went no contact with you until you apologized.", " YTA. WOW haha \u201c I haven\u2019t been able to start my life with my fianc\u00e9\u201d it\u2019s been 7years you have been able to start your life, but kept breaking up.  How is someone else\u2019s wedding going to interfere with you \u201cstarting\u201d your life together??", "YTA. You're the one who has the issue with the weddings being close, so why aren't you moving your wedding? Also, the repeated claims of jealousy are unnecessary in the context of the story and look even worse when you don't back them up with evidence. I get how it'd be frustrating to have your brother's wedding so close to yours,  but this is 100% a you-issue. You and your mother not liking the fiance does not make their wedding less valid", "Based on what you've written, Lana really hasn't done anything wrong.  I don't think someone copying another person is necessarily a wrongful act, even though it can definitely be an annoyance.  I can see if you're already on edge with a certain person, everything will seem even worse than it is and your tolerance to that person will always be on a short leash.  \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't care if someone like her was planning on having a wedding just one month right after mine.  Heck, even if it was a week after, it wouldn't really matter to me.  Maybe if it was the same day or weekend, then that's a bit much.  \n\nHowever, if it is as you are saying and people can't necessarily afford to go to both weddings in such a short amount of time.  Maybe she's just setting herself up for failure, since people may have to decline going to her wedding because they aren't financially able to do so.  \n\nAt first I thought Lana wanted to wear a white dress at your wedding, which would be considered a no no, but it seems like she wants to wear a white dress at her wedding?  I don't see how anyone has any say in that.  She could wear a black dress if she wanted.  It's her day.", "YTA as there can easily be 2 weddings in the summer a month apart.  And your mother definatey is due to her \u201cwhite dress\u201d comment.  Both of you are B****\u2019s due to your open contempt of your brother\u2019s fiance, and you come off as very spoiled.", "YTA. If she wanted to one-up you, she'd have her wedding way closer to yours. You sound extremely jealous and self centered. In SEVEN years, you've had plenty of time to start your life together, and you haven't. That's on you and your on again off again partner, not your brother. \nIf I were her, I really would one up you and reschedule my wedding for the weekend before yours. There. Now all the family you're worried about for him will already be in town for both weddings.", "YTA.  You and your family are terrible.   You sound like the golden child, spoiled and mean. \n\nIf you\u2019re old enough to get married, you should be old enough to know that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.  Your brother getting married takes nothing away from you.  Instead of accepting your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and your nieces/nephews as part of your family - which they ARE, btw - you have chosen to be a mean girl with your mom. \n\nYou say she\u2019s jealous of you, but then you say \u201cthey already have a wonderful family life\u2026 a house, kids, everything\u201d.  It sounds like you\u2019re the one who is jealous.", "YTA.  The only competitive one here is you.  And frankly if you and your fiance have broken up several times over the past 7 years I doubt your marriage will last long, assuming you actually make it to the altar", "YTA, it's a month away. How long should they wait for you and your on and off again boyfriend?", "YTA. And so is your mother for the comment about the color of the wedding dress. \n\nSounds like YOU are the one that's had and still has jealously and competitive issues with your soon to be SIL.", "Yta\n\n\nYou know how you stop a competition,  don't compete. It's their life and their choices.  It's not up to you or your mother to try and dictate them.\n\n\nJealousy is screaming in your post. And guess what?! It's coming from you.\n\n\nLet the guests decide if they want to travel. Stop pretending it's for their benefit.  Because you're the one with the problem.\n\nHow would you feel if they decided to tell you when to get married?", "YTA (add your mom too that too for the dress comment). As long as it isn't the day of or the day after your wedding, why should it matter if it happens a month later? You can't dictate to them when you think they should have it. Mind your own wedding and stop worrying about theirs!\n\nSo what if she tries to \\*one up\\* you, just shrug it off and don't care and enjoy your day.\n\nThe guest excuse is dumb. They have the same family members and it is possible they already realized by having it only one month later, people may not be able to show up. If they get mad that not enough people show up in the end, well that's a them problem, not a you problem.\n\nAgain, mind your own wedding and enjoy it! Just ignore the STB SIL and live your life.", "YTA, its incredibly self centred to assume anyone would choose their wedding date to make you feel some way about it.\n\nIf you don't like how close the weddings are, feel free to move yours.", "YTA, I can assure you they weren't even think about you when planning their date, the fact you immediately presume this was a personal attack says a lot about you tbh", "YTA.\n\nbtw- are you planning on wearing white at your wedding..? if so- are you a virgin? what does mom say about that?", "YTA. One-upping you would have been setting their wedding date to be a month before yours. You're right, lots of people probably won't be able to attend both weddings. And I'm willing to bet it'll be the 2nd wedding those people won't attend. Concentrate on your own wedding, let them concentrate on theirs.", "YTA imagine feeling so entitled you just think everyone is out to get you.  We got engaged so they had to get engaged and nobody gets engaged when I'm engaged. Oh they're clearly doing it to upstage me . Get over yourself.  Also,  the color she chooses to wear to HER wedding is her choice.", "YTA. It\u2019s always okay to ask, especially due to your concern about the guests, but not accepting no for an answer and insulting her was absolutely uncalled for. It literally won\u2019t be a competition once you stop perceiving it as one.", "Yta . You sound catty and are alienating your brother and future SIL. Treat your family kinder. Your wedding has absolutely nothing to do with theirs . And they don\u2019t have to ask permission from you and your mom about anything related to their wedding .", "yta....... and i have a strong feeling that the way you asked for this favor (because it would have been a favor, not an obligation) was not very humble. your mother couldn't even keep herself from slut shaming her future daughter in law for a few hours. good lord.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly don\u2019t like Lana, and that\u2019s fine. But your brother is a grown up and can marry who he wants, when he wants. You clearly have a low opinion of him and a high opinion of yourself. They already live together and have children, it\u2019s not shocking they want to marry. Not everything is about you. And your mother needs to stay in her lane too.", "YTA yes it might be inconvenient or even impossible for some guests to travel twice in one month, and if so then they have a decision to make. The fact that you feel like their wedding is some sort of competition is hard to understand, just enjoy your wedding and be happy for them at theirs. Sounds like a fun and joyful month for the family. It was not okay to ask them to move their wedding date at all. And your mom was wildly out of line about the dress. I think apologizing to them is a wise decision.", "YTA. I would day ESH but you really seem to be the competitive and difficult one so I\u2019m not taking your word for her nature.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to dictate their wedding, if people can\u2019t afford to fly that\u2019s their problem not yours or Lana\u2019s. Also why does it matter when their wedding is?", "YTA.\n\nYour wedding is your business; their wedding is their business.\n\nAll your rationalizations about why you deserve a nice wedding more than they do, only reinforces the impression that you think it's a competition, which it isn't.  \n\nIf you were so worried about your guest's travel then you would have suggested a double wedding.  So that's just BS.", "YTA this is so childish. And if the family can't travel twice in 2 months that's their problem not yours.", "YTA. It's a wedding day, not a wedding month. And heck it's even after your wedding.\n\n\nWorst case scenario, you find out which relatives like you or your brother better by which one they choose to come to.\n\n\nBut honestly - \"too close\"? How long is fair? 2 months? 3 months? It's an arbitrary line *you're* drawing for *them* for when it's okay to have *their* wedding.", "YTA, you're the only one competing here.", "YTA, wow, everyone here is an AH - glad I am not in this family!", "You don\u2019t own a month. YTA", "YTA. Your wedding, your business. Their wedding, their business.

My mom agreed with me and we went over to Joey's house to talk them into pushing their wedding date out farther. \n\nYTA -\n\n1. This is an argument to have it closer together and not farther.  So if they were really close together a person can fly in one time and attends both weddings.  If the weddings are far apart, they have to fly in twice to attend both weddings, which is twice as expensive.\n\n2. You can't rearrange things on everyone's budget and plans.  How do you know they are financially ok to fly in twice?  How do you know if they have other weddings and so it doesn't matter if you move it, they still have the same problem.\n\n3. Since your wedding is first, your wedding is the one they can afford.  If they can't afford two, then its your brother's wedding they can't go to.  I have no idea why you are interfering with your brother's wedding since guest's finances would only impact his wedding.", "You don't own a specific month OP. YTA.", "YTA.  You need to apologize to your brother and his soon to be wife.  Seriously their wedding is after yours and your mom needs to shut up about color of dress.  You both need to stop being judgemental of your soon to be SIL.   Otherwise you'll lose him and kids forever!", "YTA. If you are worried about too much travel for your wedding guests, I would think that you would suggest moving the weddings to the same weekend to save on travel burdens.", "YTA it's pretty clean that you're the jealous one here.", "YTA, your post REEKS of jealousy and you clearly really dislike your SIL. Both your brother and your fianc\u00e9 dragged their asses for years to propose and now you\u2019re going to quibble over dates? Who cares? Why are you letting your SIL control your emotions and how can she outshine you? Weddings aren\u2019t a competition and if that\u2019s how you feel you shouldn\u2019t be getting married. Who cares what she does, just live your life. And your brother\u2019s relationship is really none of your business and he can get married for whatever reason he wants.

He'd have to tell them this ahead of time, so they would compare his hospitality to yours.\n\nUnfortunately 7 years off on/off going through hell and back sounds like a shaky foundation to marry on, but I might be wrong.\n\nYou are definitely the jealous one in this situation", "You and your mom are wrong. \n\n1. Your wedding is one day, you can't make rules for people outside of that day. Some people just might not come to your wedding. Others might not go to theirs. Get over it\n\n2. The fact that you and your mom went over to his house and had the AUDACITY to disrespect his fiance is disgusting.  The comment about the dress was unnecessary.  \n\n3. Your post screams that you have an inflated sense 6 worth. She's probably not jealous of you and you're just an A hole. This whole one upping and she'd jealous and and we tolerate her for the kids says WAY MORE about you than her. \n \n4. I think you're overcompensating for your mess of a relationship with your fiance if you ask me.", "YTA", "YTA - While your point about people perhaps not wanting to come to both is valid, it's just something you'll both have to accept.  Try to just enjoy planning your wedding, and not make comparisons.  You think you aren't being competetive and want to be peaceful but you are making things worse.  You don't have to love your SIL - maybe she is kinda awful - but if you want to maintain a good relationship with your brother and neices and nephews you have to suck it up.  Also that was an AH comment for your mom to make too.", "YTA. Their wedding is after yours. If guests are only going to be able to afford to make it to one wedding then it wouldn\u2019t it be yours since it\u2019s first?\n\nIt sounds like your *real* issue is that you want to be the only bride this summer and don\u2019t want their wedding to \u201cbeat\u201d yours\u2026as if it\u2019s some sort of a competition.", "Oh good grief, self centred much? \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nIf you don\u2019t want a wedding within a month then you can always move your wedding", "YTA and so is your mother for making that comment.

We broke up several times but we always found a way back to each other. We've been through hell and back and we're more in love now than ever.\n\nMy brother Joey has been with this girl Lana for 5 years and they have 2 kids together. She got pregnant with their first kid only a few months into their casual relationship and they got serious after that. My family and I tolerate her for the kids. She's kind of loud, competitive and self-centered and she copies me all the time because she's jealous I guess.\n\nLast October my fiance finally proposed to me, and a couple months later to everybody's surprise Joey proposed to Lana. He always said that he didn't want to marry her so this totally came out of left field. Lana claimed that they agreed to get married for tax reasons and they were in love too but I call BS. She couldn't stand that I'm getting married first so she forced my brother to propose. \n\nNext she set their wedding date to 1 month after mine to one up me because that's how she is. I thought that was not fair to our guests because some of them live out of town and they can't afford to fly here twice in 1 month for 2 weddings. My mom agreed with me and we went over to Joey's house to talk them into pushing their wedding date out farther. \n\nJoey and Lana got very defensive. Lana said that she always dreamed of a summer wedding and she had the perfect dress for it which was bright white and my mom made an unnecessary comment about how she shouldn't be wearing a white dress. It only pissed off my brother more and he screamed at us. I tried to get them to understand that they already have a wonderful family life... a house, kids, everything and I haven't gotten to start that life with my fiance so the least they could do is let me have my dream wedding in peace without her trying to compete with me. Joey called my relationship a sham and kicked me and my mom out of his house. \n\nJoey and Lana aren't talking to us. They uninvited us to their daughter's birthday party next weekend. I just want us all to live in peace with each other without any competitiveness or ill feelings. I will apologize if I'm wrong.

You come across as judgemental and nasty towards their relationship.", "ESH", "YTA.", "NAH - If they set their wedding date BEFORE yours then you would have a legitimate grudge.  Your extended family actually have a good excuse now that they could get time off to come to your wedding but that one month was just too soon for them to be able to do it again.  Now people who don't really approve of a real wedding after two kids together can skip it without it being obvious why.  Your brother might be an asshole but not because of this.  You and your mom should have both anticipated there was absolutely nothing to be gained by having this conversation!!!", "Ew YTA", "YTA. You're assuming motivations and from a very petty place. If you're truly concerned about people having to travel for two weddings, move YOUR wedding date back to be closer to your brother's. People can travel once and attend both weddings. You're not wrong to discuss it with your brother and his fianc\u00e9. You're 100% wrong if you're trying to dictate their wedding date in any way or shame them for not moving their date. You don't get to tell other people what to do or how to feel.", "YTA: you and and your man make up and break up several times but you think that because *now* you\u2019re \u201cmore in love than ever before\u201d you\u2019re somehow superior? You do nothing but shit on your brothers girl and make judgement after judgment.  Maybe she\u2019s not great, but you don\u2019t sound like a peach either. \n\nYou say she\u2019s getting married one month after you to \u201cone up you.\u201d How is that one upping you? Do you think her venue, decor and food will be better? Will she look better than you? All of this sounds like being insecure that your wedding is going to suck and hers will be better. This is your insecurity. If guests have to travel to come to your wedding, go home, and then come back it sounds like you\u2019re afraid guests will pick them over you. Which begs me to ask the question: why would they pick hers/brothers over yours if she\u2019s so awful?", "Okay...  \nSkimmed the comments and they're about what I expect from reddit of late. Maybe I'm getting jaded about humanity, because they love of late to pick on one thing and ignore the rest.  \n\n\nI think you have resentment for Lana, but are in denial about how bad it is. And to be fair it may be warranted (can't tell just based on this post) but I think you need to come to terms with the fact there probably isn't going to be a \"One big happy family\" with the two of you involved. Without knowing more about her or seeing her side I can't say if one is more at fault with the other but you need to give up on that. You can have a mostly neutral interaction but you need to come to terms with that as it will help inform you of the best future actions.  \n\n\nFor instance, you have a valid point that the 2 weddings may tax outside family to visit both (as others have agreed that's a concern). You were kinda right to approach them to make them aware, but once they snapped back that's where you drop it, and just drop it going forward with them. If anyone does complain to you about it directly, personally I'd use that as a chance to redirect \"Ask Joey and Lana they scheduled it so close, nothing I can do about it\" and move on and let the family decide what they want to do with the truth. Because other than informing them of the burden that's really all you can do here.  \n\n\nYou'll find once you accept the truth about the current state of your relationship with the 2 of them and forget about trying to force something that just isn't going to happen you can move forward much better, and just focus on your actions. If the family come to you to cave, well you were there first, just stick to it that you can't move it, and why should you? It'll cause a bit of animosity with J and L but... Sadly that's the truth of your relationship.  \n\n\nOkay I'm going long. I guess if I'm going to judge I'd go ESH. Though I think on your side it's more about being in denial about the reality that you and Joey are just growing apart and you and Lana just can't work with each other and once you start ignoring her jabs you'll be much happier.", "YTA and your momma is too.", "YTA Joey sounds like a good future husband.

I attended one and he attended the other.\n\nOP does have a point about having two family weddings so close together, it could make it difficult for relatives and others traveling great distances, thus having to force many to choose which wedding to attend.\n\nAlso, the brother and fiance disinvited them to the niece's birthday party. Was OP that rude or is the brother that offended..?", "Could be. Or they both had a lot of growing up to do. A ton of relationships today tend to suffer with selfishness, etc. from one or both people. Staying together isn't exactly always a good sign either... Case in point\u2014my parents have been married 40 years. For all of my existence, their marriage has been a living hell and made my life hell, too. It's their own stubbornness that keeps the marriage going. But they are toxic, narcissistic people. I'm in No Contact with them.", "Considering they're in the same family, they're probably all jealous people, or at least both women could be of each other.", "I'm going off of what information was presented based on OP's storytelling, because OP also stated that the brother didn't want to marry his fiance.", "yes, if someone slutshames the other parent of your children... who you are together with for 5 years... who you want to spend the rest of your life with, you cut them off.  people respect your SO, or they can disrespect them from a long distance.", "Your parents and OP have something in common then.", "Disagree. SIL in my opinion did nothing to show jealousy. What's there to be jealous of? A couple who break up but \"keep finding their way to each other\"? A couple that's been through hell and back?\n\nSIL is building a family, I thing she's got bigger fish to fry.", "You don't think people can change their minds? Their relationship is none of OP's business."]}
