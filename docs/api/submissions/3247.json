Kayla got married last summer to a guy named mike who she\u2019s been with since they were 18. The two of them have a daughter Mary 9months. \n\nI\u2019ve met mike a couple times.

She got really mad and asked what the baby and mike were supposed to do. I told her they can stay home or go to mikes families house. But that I didn\u2019t want a baby at thanksgiving. She got annoyed and hung up. \n\nKayla ended up not showing up and not answering any texts from me. My brother ended up not coming either. My mom and dad shamed me the entire time. My mom even called me a selfish ass. \n\nMy husband agrees with me. I didn\u2019t want to invite my nieces husband and baby because they are strangers. And I definitely didn\u2019t want a baby at my thanksgiving. \n\nAITA? \nEdit: my kids when they were young stayed with our elderly neighbor during holiday events because they couldn\u2019t behave.
