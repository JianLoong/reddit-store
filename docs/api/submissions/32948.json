I\u2019m not comfortable getting into details beyond that.\u201d", "NTA. You're an adult now and your healthcare is your business. As a mom, we of course want to know all about our adult children. But you're allowed to have boundaries and choose what to share. Especially if you think discussing it will be detrimental to your progress.", "Definitely NTA, and I can totally identify with this. I was always overweight, and when I got older, it began to affect my health, so I started exercising and eating right and began losing weight. My mother's reaction: \"You're too skinny,\" even though I was still 30 pounds overweight and, according to the doctor, obese. My point is you don't need to loop your parents in. It sounds like you're doing it the right way (no fad diets, just healthy choices).

But I'm curious, have you ever mentioned anything to them about how their behavior towards food was totally inappropriate all your life? If not, then they will probably keep nagging at you because they don't understand that what they are doing is the problem.", "NTA. You're an adult. What you and your health care provider talk about is none of your parent's damn business. They caused your poor relationship with food in the first place.

Do whatever you need to do to be happy and healthy, and if that involves not talking about it, that's fine.\n\n I'm going through a weight loss journey right now as well. I am in the process of trying to get a diagnosis for what my doctors think is an auto immune disease and I've gained some weight as a result of my symptoms. I also have a mother who even when I was not overweight would knit pick the things I was eating because she has always struggled with her weight. We also grew up poor so I have to break the mentality she taught me that you have to eat what is offered to you because anything else would be wasteful. I totally understand not wanting to talk to that person about it.\n\nThis is a *super* personal journey, for me finding my independence is going to be crucial for my success. Doing things because *I* want/decide to do them. My boyfriend is younger than me and can eat whatever he wants in excess and not gain weight. I've needed to teach myself that I don't have to eat everything he eats, I don't have to finish the portions he gives me, I can go for a run every morning by myself and motivate myself independently.\n\nI wish you success in your journey!", "Yikes!

If it is a healthy relationship, everyone can learn, and move one.\n\nYou need this conversation with your parents, but I doubt they will hear what  you have to say.  They are likely to make it all about themselves.  \"How dare you blame us?\"  \"We were good parents, and you are shaming us.\"  that type of stuff.\n\nIt may actually help to have a counselor, a third party  (NOT the nutritionist - unless she agrees not to share info) explain to your parents that it is healthy for you to take responsibility for your food intake.

It is a difficult situation to be in but I would just try to remember that you are not in the wrong at all for keeping them out of the loop.

Just because they are your parents doesnt mean that have to know everything thats going on in your life.", "Even if they don't listen, it may be cathartic the next time they harass you just to pop off at them and tell them to leave you the hell alone because it was their fault to begin with so if they want to talk to anybody about it they need to talk to themselves since they're at fault. Tell him to go see a nutritionist themselves to find out how to properly raise a child in regard to food issues.

I don't do cheat days, I buy what I'm craving and tell myself I always have it there to eat when I want to.\n\nI know it's a problem that I want to always go against my parents and I'm trying to work on it. if they encouraged me to have a healthy relationship with food as a kid maybe things would be different. but they didn't and here we are.", "damn being singled out like that must suck. my brother was 14 when I was born so he was more like a third parent for me, so my parents didn't really compare us that much. i can't imagine being body shamed AND compared to your sibling. awful", "You can do the polar opposite too- like did you lose weight ? \nHow about a cookie, it will make u happier?
