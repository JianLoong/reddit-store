{"id": 33854, "submission_id": "18s40b8", "title": "AITA if I refuse my sister to buy her the birthday gift she wants?", "selftext": "I (27F) feel like a potential asshole towards my sister (25F).\n\nMy sisters birthday is in January. She never knows whats she wants for her birthday, so I always have to guess something to give her. She always loved my gifts. Those gifts are usually around \u20ac50-70 ish.\n\nI have had a high profile job for the past 3 years. While I dont throw my momeny away, I do like to spend it on some more high quality products. I live together with my boyfriend (32M) and he also earns a nice paycheck. So we live a but more \"upperclass\". This is also kind of the financial situation me and my sister grew up in.\n\nMy sister has only had 1 job in her life at a supermarket years ago for only a few months. She is studying ans getting her degree (which when she gets it, she will be working as a dentist so she will make a lot of money which she has to mention everytime I ask her about her studies). She lives with her boyfriend (31M). He earns a little above minimum wage and they live in the worst part of town. She pays nothing, he pays everything. Which is their buisniss and is totally fine to me. In our country this income is enough to pay for a small apartment and all the bills on time. My parents fully pay her eduction. So they are not poor at all.\n\nWhen my birthday was in the Summer, she gave me a gift that was about \u20ac15. I was really happy with it and thanked her a lot for it. I do not care how much it costed, but the fact that she listed to what I wanted meant a lot to me.\n\nNow her birthday is in a few weeks. She finally came up with something she wanted: merch from her favorite band. I was happy she finally came up with something. Promblem is that band only has a merch store in the States and we live in Europe. There are still lots of delays because of black friday/holliday shipping with the post and the merch website estimated that shipping would take up till March. Also, the shipping and important tax combined are more then double of what the merch would cost. I dont like that for a gift, that the bulk of my money would go in shipping and taxes plus it would be here way too late.\n\nWhen I tried to explain this to her on the phone she got pissed. She said that I order stuff from around the world all the time (not true) so I would have no trouble with paying a high shipping cost and taxes. When I explained to her that this is not the case and if those extra costs are so high I just dont buy it because I find it a waste of money she just said \"but you got plenty\". I thought to myself okay I should just try to keep the peace and ask her if she would like something else for her birthday. She responded with either a shopping trip with my credit card or a pair of \u20ac250 shoes. When I responded with that I found that outrageous, she called me a self absorbed b\\*tch and ended the phone call and has not responded to my texts or calls since.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1703692975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s40b8/aita_if_i_refuse_my_sister_to_buy_her_the/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give her a cash gift if you still want to be on good terms with her entitled ass.", "NTA\n\nHow much is the band merch? You can waste the money on that, a shopping trip is kinda out of the cards now and would maybe have been unreasonable in the first place if she was thinking you could afford *annything*. The shoes are also pricey so I don't see how those make any more sense than the shirt even if they are more sane than a shopping trip.\n\nI'm assuming you're going to make up with her, I just don't know how absurdly overpriced the band stuff might be. You could probably just get her some stuff you think she will like and then plan to do the band stuff, possibly, later.", "\u00a0She pays nothing, he pays everything. Which is their buisniss-so why are you telling others about their business?", "NTA\n\ni would be inclined to not buy her anything, but if you still want to give her a gift, stick the 50 in a nice card an write she can put it towards whatever she likes.", "NTA - But how about from now on your gift to each other is to not have to get each other anything. It all evens out and you don't have to deal with her anymore.", "Nta", "YTA - You asked her what she wanted for her birthday and then began to shoot her down over her choice.  If the money, as you claim, isn't the issue to you why not get her what she wants without all the drama from you?  You seem so exhausting no wonder she snapped at you, I would have too.", "NTA she is acting wildly entitled. None of us owe each other gifts. We give because it's a nice thing to do. She can fuck off.", "Sure, send her shopping with your card. \n\nBut change the card limit beforegand to whatever amount you want to spend on a gift for her.", "Simply solution.  Give sister money for gift.  Left her pay shipping and taxes if it's no big deal to waste money on that", "NTA-you explained to her your reasoning. She chose to be outrageous with her demands.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister owes you an apology. I hope you get a sincere one.\n\nThe thing about poverty is it attacks your brain, almost like drugs do really. It inhibits your ability to treat money rationally, and makes everything money related way more emotional than it really is. I hope that once your sister is making enough money to support her family she's be able to realize how selfish she was being.", "NTA. She isn't entitled to any gift at all, she is acting like a brat", "NTA. Your sister shouldn't be calling you names or whatever. \n\nWith that said, it seems like you overthought. Your sister wants merch from her favorite band. You said YOU don't like the shipping cost or the delay, but if your sister is happy, what's the problem? Just spend the \u20ac50-70 on the product and shipping and let her know it will arrive in March.\n\nBut she could have told you that instead of getting passed. Thus, still NTA.", "She\u2019s the spoiled entitled one. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that she is asking for any of that and having a tantrum like a toddler. I would stick with an amount you\u2019re comfortable with and just buy her a VISA gift card to put toward something she wants.", "When asking for a gift you should be mindful that you're not being greedy af", "it\u2019s not about affording it. It\u2019s not the sister\u2019s money. She can\u2019t demand anything and expect it, because she didn\u2019t earn the money!", "How is this a hard one? The sister isn\u2019t asking for something she needs, she\u2019s asking for band merch, and is upset that OP isn\u2019t willing to fork over unlimited access to her credit card as an alternative.", "She didn\u2019t say the gift was something she asked for or wanted she just said she was happy with it bc her sister got her something", "Right, the reason you ask for something as a gift is because the item is so coveted, you might not usually justify it for yourself. She didn't care it wouldn't be there on time, she just wanted the precious hard-to-get thing - and you (OP) don't wanna spend the shipping because you don't *like* the idea that it's more than the item? She probably just pulled out those other (actually egregious) ideas because she was pissed that you shot down something that is, frankly, easy for you.\n\nYou could do it, you just dont wanna. And that sucks. Don't bother asking next time, if you're just gonna do what *you* wanna do. (There are probably ways to get custom merch closer to you - think customized tees, bags, themed jewelry with lyric engravings).", "Guys we found the sister", "That\u2019s great idea in fact.\n(I\u2019m the one who hates shipping costs)\nOn the other hand, if she didn\u2019t earn this money she\u2019ll probably won\u2019t get it. Unfortunately.", "Ummm most people who deal with poverty do not act like OPs sister. Having had low paying jobs and struggling to pay bills let alone giving gifts. I struggle with people gifting me things over a certain amount but I sure as heck don't flip out at someone over them having a boundary over how much they're willing to spend.", "I feel like that's more of a money as a blanket statement thing. Money changes all people.\n\nOP's sister gives off the vibe of a privileged person told no for the first time ever.\n\nShe doesn't have to work to pay her bills (covered by parents and bf), doesn't have to worry about school costs or loans (also covered by her parents), so never has to worry about having a roof over her head or food on the table. But she also probably doesn't have enough to live the lifestyle she grew up with. She sees that OP has that lifestyle, so assumes OP doesn't care about the cost of anything because *she* doesn't care about the cost of anything. \n\nShe's so used to being given everything by her family that the one time she's told *no*, she doesn't know how to handle it.", "The way I understood it is the merch itself was on budget (I assume 50-70$, sorry, I can't find the Euro sign on my keyboard. lol) and then she would have to add the exact amount for the shipping cost, which would double her budget.", "Shipping costs and import taxes between the US and Europe would eat up most of that budget.", "The sister wasn't for the first ask.", "I said it\u2019s a hard one because I know how money can blind you, and the feeling of not being able to spend money freely.", "Are you the sister lol. Why is it unreasonable to want most of the money spent on a gift to be, idk, on the actual gift? Extra fees costing more than the actual gift is ridiculous no matter what. OP has the right to decide how to spend their money, sister\u2019s \u201cconsolation gift options\u201d just scream entitled.", "Yes we did!!! \n\nThis is why when I talk gifts with my family we have a max price point on gifts. However my friends and family would never pull a stunt like this and they would understand if something ended up being out of budget. Also $250 isn\u2019t chump changed. Not understanding these YTA comments.", "OP explained why the first ask wasn't reasonable to get.", "That doesn\u2019t make it okay. If anything, allowing money to blind you so much that you lash out and destroy otherwise good family relationships is worse. Greed isn\u2019t a good look on anyone.", "To the sister, that IS a huge part of the gift - the fact that the fees would be covered. Idk how you don't get that, but carry on. The 'are you the x' comments are tired and also not funny, cause... Clearly not."]}
