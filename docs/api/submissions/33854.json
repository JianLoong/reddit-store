She never knows whats she wants for her birthday, so I always have to guess something to give her. She always loved my gifts. Those gifts are usually around \u20ac50-70 ish.\n\nI have had a high profile job for the past 3 years. While I dont throw my momeny away, I do like to spend it on some more high quality products. I live together with my boyfriend (32M) and he also earns a nice paycheck. So we live a but more \"upperclass\". This is also kind of the financial situation me and my sister grew up in.\n\nMy sister has only had 1 job in her life at a supermarket years ago for only a few months. She is studying ans getting her degree (which when she gets it, she will be working as a dentist so she will make a lot of money which she has to mention everytime I ask her about her studies). She lives with her boyfriend (31M). He earns a little above minimum wage and they live in the worst part of town. She pays nothing, he pays everything. Which is their buisniss and is totally fine to me. In our country this income is enough to pay for a small apartment and all the bills on time. My parents fully pay her eduction. So they are not poor at all. \n\nWhen my birthday was in the Summer, she gave me a gift that was about \u20ac15. I was really happy with it and thanked her a lot for it. I do not care how much it costed, but the fact that she listed to what I wanted meant a lot to me.\n\nNow her birthday is in a few weeks. She finally came up with something she wanted: merch from her favorite band. I was happy she finally came up with something. Promblem is that band only has a merch store in the States and we live in Europe. There are still lots of delays because of black friday/holliday shipping with the post and the merch website estimated that shipping would take up till March. Also, the shipping and important tax combined are more then double of what the merch would cost. I dont like that for a gift, that the bulk of my money would go in shipping and taxes plus it would be here way too late. It would go from \u20ac35 to over \u20ac80 with all these extra costs. About \u20ac50 just for shipping and taxes.\n\nWhen I tried to explain this to her on the phone she got pissed. She said that I order stuff from around the world all the time (not true) so I would have no trouble with paying a high shipping cost and taxes. When I explained to her that this is not the case and if those extra costs are so high I just dont buy it because I find it a waste of money she just said \"but you got plenty\". I thought to myself okay I should just try to keep the peace and ask her if she would like something else for her birthday. She responded with either a shopping trip with my credit card or a pair of \u20ac250 shoes. When I responded with that I found that outrageous, she called me a self absorbed b\\*tch and ended the phone call and has not responded to my texts or calls since.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1703692975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s40b8/aita_if_i_refuse_my_sister_to_buy_her_the/", "score": 281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can waste the money on that, a shopping trip is kinda out of the cards now and would maybe have been unreasonable in the first place if she was thinking you could afford *annything*. The shoes are also pricey so I don't see how those make any more sense than the shirt even if they are more sane than a shopping trip.\n\nI'm assuming you're going to make up with her, I just don't know how absurdly overpriced the band stuff might be.

I hope you get a sincere one.\n\nThe thing about poverty is it attacks your brain, almost like drugs do really. It inhibits your ability to treat money rationally, and makes everything money related way more emotional than it really is.

Thus, still NTA.", "She\u2019s the spoiled entitled one. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that she is asking for any of that and having a tantrum like a toddler.

She didn't care it wouldn't be there on time, she just wanted the precious hard-to-get thing - and you (OP) don't wanna spend the shipping because you don't *like* the idea that it's more than the item? She probably just pulled out those other (actually egregious) ideas because she was pissed that you shot down something that is, frankly, easy for you.\n\nYou could do it, you just dont wanna.

She sees that OP has that lifestyle, so assumes OP doesn't care about the cost of anything because *she* doesn't care about the cost of anything. \n\nShe's so used to being given everything by her family that the one time she's told *no*, she doesn't know how to handle it.", "The way I understood it is the merch itself was on budget (I assume 50-70$, sorry, I can't find the Euro sign on my keyboard. lol) and then she would have to add the exact amount for the shipping cost, which would double her budget.", "Shipping costs and import taxes between the US and Europe would eat up most of that budget.", "The sister wasn't for the first ask.", "I said it\u2019s a hard one because I know how money can blind you, and the feeling of not being able to spend money freely.", "Are you the sister lol. Why is it unreasonable to want most of the money spent on a gift to be, idk, on the actual gift? Extra fees costing more than the actual gift is ridiculous no matter what.

Your sister is tacky. Nobody is entitled to choose what gifts others are willing to give them.", "Just buy her the merch and pay for the shipping.

I'm sure they have something mech adjacent there...", "If you're offended by the amount of shipping (that it will double the cost of the gift), give her a gift card for the amount you ARE willing to spend and let her pay the difference. \n\n\nETA: I'm shocked by the number of adults who believe their birthdays are a 'thing' after they are grown. It's just another day to the rest of the world.", "Wtf NTA\n\nI get really wanting stuff from overseas i really do. I order stuff from japan regularily but recently got hit with custom fees of 75 euro and. That money is just \"wasted\" to be honest. If i knew that i probably would have not ordered it but im still happy about getting it. But that was my money.\n\nDemanding that someone would pay these 75 euros for a gift would be outragious. I mean yeah i can ask and inform them that there will be custom fees but if they say no then I cant force them to get me the expensive gift. Its a gift not a payment for something.\n\nYoure nta for not buying her the gift and her reaction was way out of line. A 250 bag?? A shopping trip with your CREDIT CARD??? when she has her degree she can still buy merch of her favourite band with her own money.\n\nYou never complained about how much her gifts cost but i bet if you gave her something and revealed it was cheap afterwards she would be angry/sad about the gift.", "NTA, although if the original gift was in budget even after all the fees, then I'm not sure what the issue is. If it was also out of budget, then I'd just get a giftcard for the budgeted amount to a store you know she likes.", "NTA. So, if you give her what she wants you're the best sister in the world and if you don't, you get insulted and blocked?\n\nThe merch, does it have to be original? You'll can find very good copies all over the internet, with faster and cheaper shipping. You could also have something made. Third option is to spend the usual money you do for her present on a giftcard, and if she wants to use some of that for shipping fees that's on her", "NTA. Your sis is jealous. She acted really negatively though and it was unwarranted. \n\nOne of the harder things about growing up is learning that if you want nice stuff, you likely have to buy it for yourself. It\u2019s a little crass to demand expensive gifts from people.\n\nYour sis sounds really materialistic. Maybe you guys should put gifts on the backburner and focus on having experiences together.", "NTA Your sister is the self absorbed b\\*tch she needs a reality check!! She's living rent free with her boyfriend and your parents are paying for her schooling.  She sounds entitled and snobby.  First off you don't have to buy her anything.  However, her price range is ridiculous for someone that only worked briefly! Does she know the value of a dollar?", "Give her a 70\u20ac Visa card and she can order the merch herself, if she\u2019s willing to pay all the charges.

Next time, make a donation to a charity in her name. If you feel really nice, make it a cause she actually supports.", "Your sister sounds like she thinks you owe her.  Get her a gift similar in value to what she gave you.  Maybe next year,  she won't be so demanding.", "Her bf puts up with ALOT", "NTA\n\nAnd then she came back with an even more expensive gift suggestion of the shoes.\n\nCan you make her some merch locally ie have a picture of the band printed onto a jumper/t-shirt?  Or whatever she wanted the most.  Doing something like this will likely be cheaper, or if it's not, the cost won't be mainly for the shipping.", "NTA I think this requires a further conversation. Why does your sister believe that you owe her ?", "Sis will be taking pics of the front and back of the card  - don't let her near it.  Maybe a Visa/MC gift card for the value of the band merch?", "Good suggestion .", "OP said \"half\" and I took that literally. But even so, if sister's best present is a \u20ac10 item that costs \u20ac60 to ship, get her the thing.\n\nI (northern US) have a set of dishes imported from Mexico. I bought them at a store 30 miles from the border. When one serving dish broke, I had to pay $80 to get a replacement shipped instead of the original $20. But if someone had asked me what I wanted as an $80 gift, I would have asked for a replacement dish.", "The post says 35 and up to 80 with shipping + taxes\n\nImo thats reasonable for a birthday gift", "Well, good thing I said NTA then, because that's just rude.", "OP literally wrote > but the fact that she listed to what I wanted meant a lot to me.", "I wonder if the merch store do e-gift cards. 'Cause then sister gets the merch she wants, but OP doesn't have to pay for shipping.", "For my family, 35 is reasonable but 80+ is only something a parent gets for a teenage child or a significant other buys for you. \n\nChristmas gift may potentially be different (we chipped in and got my MIL a $200-250 vacuum for Christmas, split 3 ways) but that would be your only gift.", "Well once she becomes a dentist she can purchase her own merch!! She's an entitled asshole and owes OP a massive apology.  Nothing hard about that at all.

I know exactly what your talking about. people like to act like they've lived the hard life but living a big chunk of your life without being about to buy anything that isn't absolutely necessary while watching everyone you know go on vacation and buy clothes, make up.. just everything. to thr point of poor people use socks for years without buying new ones. they're all stretched out and as long as they don't have holes its not worth replacing. forget about owning more than 2 bras. \n\nlike.. the sister is still TA 100% but people don't get it. The anger that comes with that. OP also says they live off of a single min wage paycheck. idk where they live but most countries i know, your still poor even if you can afford rent. \n\nso I understand the sister, even if she's an asshole.", "Did you even read my comment?

Everyone is coming at me here but I said NTA, i\u2019m just trying to look at both sides. This is supposed to be unbiased", "No, I did not miss that part, I'm merely saying that this post is Easy Mode. She's 25 and throwing a fit because she can't have a shopping spree on her sister's dime. There are literal children more mature than that. I have plenty of empathy for the penniless, but not for bratty adult siblings who can't get the latest funko figurine or what have you.", "Asking for the expensive merch was one incident. Getting mad about not getting said merch was one incident. Demanding a shopping spree or 250 shoes is one incident. Calling OP a self absorbed bitch for refusing is one incident. \n\nThese were multiple incidences of increasing entitlement that at many point the sister could have walked back from and saved face, and she chose not to. That\u2019s more than one and definitely reeks of greed.", "NTA.  After her behavior I'd get her the same thing she got you.  Or no gift.  She's actually incredibly entitled to your money.", "YTA.  Just give her what she wants.  It sounds reasonable to me and so what if it's late?  As long as your sister doesn't mind getting it late why should you care?", "NTA, jealousy is ugly and your sister is consumed by it. She doesn\u2019t get to demand anything of you. I wouldn\u2019t buy her anything now, but that\u2019s me."]}
