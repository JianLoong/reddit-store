You didn\u2019t call him ugly: you can have zero attraction to people who everyone else finds conventionally handsome (Brad Pitt for me, I just don\u2019t get the hype) and feel earth shattering lust for someone who looks like a wrinkled potato (Hugh Laurie, yum). \n\nHe played a stupid game and won a stupid prize - but please keep yourself safe as sometimes it\u2019s the so called nice guys who escalate when their pride is wounded.", "NTA.

Trying to have a relationship with a coworker is highly unethical and he should have stopped once you told him you were uninterested.  Once he left the job because he couldn\u2019t pursue you romantically he deserved to be fired.", "NTA. You didn't say he's ugly. You said you weren't attracted to him. That would be true if you like heavy vs. thin, blond vs. dark hair, biker vs. nerdy, shorter vs. taller, etc. Attractive isn't beautiful, it's personal. Go to your boss right away and tell him that you are uncomfortable with the co-worker (CW) not taking your direct comments that you weren't looking for a relationship and cornering you when you were alone then following up with a text when you made it more clear. That young man doesn't know boundaries. If he is fired, he'll learn them and it will still not be your fault and you won't be the AH.", "NTA go to your supervisor IMMEDIATELY he\u2019s going to cause you all kinds of issues", "NTA - you tried, he threw a hissy fit.", "NTA. You tried to let him down gently. He pushed the issue and asked a question he wasn\u2019t prepared to hear the answer to. In the future, maybe he\u2019ll take a hint.", "NTA. First, he sexually harassed you by continually asking you out. Please report this to HR (if there is one), your manager, and the owner of the establishment.

You tried to shut him down nicely and he kept pushing you. He can\u2019t force you to like him. \n\nThe only thing you could have done differently (which he still would have been upset about) would be to ask him to stop bringing it up after the first incident, and if he continued go to your supervisor/manager.\n\nSorry you are going through that, you are def NTA.", "NTA. He's harassing you.", "NTA. He is 100% the AH for not taking no for an answer and pushing, ESPECIALLY at work where you in theory need to work together, and you are \"trapped\" and unable to just walk out when he's being overbearing.\n\nI agree with the people saying go to your manager because you absolutely don't want the coworker's side being the only thing he hears. Go to him preemptively and say you're not comfortable working with him, or that at least you want him talked to to make sure that he's either not going to try to punish or harass you or make your work harder.", "NTA, I\u2019d send a text back. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you were ugly, I said I wasn\u2019t attracted to you, and this text message is a shining example of why.

Do yourself a favor and close your curtains tonight.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to tell him several different ways that you're not interested. Not your fault that he's dense. I don't see any choice but to be blunt because at that point you must have been getting uncomfortable. He was actually harassing you. Then he told you what you should have said in order to protect his fragility. I bet he also thinks he's a \"nice guy\".  I think you should tell your boss in case this guy escalates things.", "NTA - absolutely not. Eff that guy. He couldn\u2019t take a hint and kept harassing you. Now you were more direct and he can\u2019t handle it.", "You should talk to the manager asap as well. He\u2019s gonna try to twist it somehow. Tell the manager he also makes you uncomfortable and you also don\u2019t want to work the same shift as him anymore.", "You are soooo NTA. This man was being entirely inappropriate with you. Not because he shot his shot but because he \u201cdemanded\u201d your further attention on the matter after being rejected.", "There is a difference between looks and attraction. Many of the things which are attractive about a person have nothing to do with them being good looking. You did not insult him. He harassed you at work and eventually you told him you were not attracted to him. It is up to him to take rejection not you to manage his feelings. You were not rude or unkind. He wouldn't take the hint, pushed and eventually had to get a hard no.

And well done.", "nta. we all have a type and he's not yours for one reason or another. and if he wants to go to the manager/owner and request you two not work together anymore i say go to the manager and request the same. there's no reason why you should be looking over your shoulders wondering if your co-worker could possibly escalate things to something more serious.", "NTA\n\nHe asked, you answered. Hopefully he does get his shifts changed to avoid you so as you don't have to put up with his pathetic BS.", "NTA at all. There are probably a bunch of people who are gonna say ESH. but that is not the case. It was his choice to persue you, it was his choice to ignore your bounderies, it was his choice to corner you and ask in a very creepy way why... And it was his choice, that he asked you why you didnt lie about his looks.  \n\n\nAlso go to HR and do your story. You probably are not the first he tried this on, and won't be the last...", "You tried to let him down gently but he ignored that. I think he is trying to guilt trip you just to go out with him. He is the AH.\n\nNTA you did the right thing.", "NTA. \nHe had no business even asking you like that. Get HR involved, this is not only harassment but there can be retaliation \n\nAnd you didn't call him ugly! You said you weren't attracted to him. Attraction (or lack thereof) is not something we have control over.\n\nBasically he asked you but would only accept the answer that you liked him back. Any other reason isn't good enough. No is a whole sentence. I am not attracted to you is the best and nicest way to go. It doesn't say \"you are unattractive\"", "NTA\n\nHe was the one who was acting inappropriately by constantly pursuing you at work.\n\nRight now - write down everything you remember: the dates & behavior of him hitting on you, being suggestive, asking you to 'hang out' etc and what you said.  Email it to yourself so you have a time stamp.   ~~If HE goes to a manager~~ **\\***you will have this handy to show that HE was actually the one making YOU uncomfortable for quite a while.\n\nWhile, sure, most people do take 'I'm not attracted to you' to mean 'You're an ugly troll that will die alone' thats not at all what you said.  Attraction is subjective. Chris Hemsworth is a beautiful man but I'm not the least bit attracted to him.  A dude might remind you of your brother, another might sound just like the guy who bullied you in high school ie it's got nothing to do with Him it's all about You.  I'm sure this guy is attracted to some women (you) and might not consider dating other girls - it doesn't mean anybody is 'ugly'.\n\nThe easiest thing to have said in this situation would be - \"I make it a rule not to date people I work with, I do not want the drama.  I'm flattered, you are a nice person but please stop asking because it is making me uncomfortable here at work.'\n\nAlso he's gaslighting you right now. He's trying to twist your words, and make you feel guilty.  You didn't say anything mean - you are not responsible for how he interpreted it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\***Edit to add - that YOU might go to HR first.  Don't let him spin his story, let them know what happened and his behavior.", "NTA - He\u2019s misconstruing the conversation. I\u2019d speak to your manager about being uncomfortable working with him because he seems to have a loose grasp on reality.", "NTA.\nYou tried to deal with him as kindly and maturely as possible and he kept pushing. You should also talk with your manager, explain the situation and that he has been making extremely uncomfortable, and they it is best that you are not on the same shifts, or at least not alone.", "NTA.  Let your manager know he\u2019s been harassing you at work.  And that he made you close by yourself since you weren\u2019t physically attracted to him.\n\nHe lied when he said he would have preferred you lied instead of the truth.  You did lie at first. Then he would not stop so you gave him the truth.  Which he clearly couldn\u2019t handle.  At 25 he needs to learn how to control his emotions", "NTA. You are at work. WORK. not a bar. Not a club. WORK.\n\nI am once again begging my fellow men to understand that nobody wants to see, hear about, or think about your private parts while punched in. And nobody wants to think about you thinking about their parts either. At work, just act like nobody even HAS private parts. Easy!", "NTA - go to your manager, he is harassing you and accusing you of it.  Trying to have a relationship with a coworker is highly unethical and he should have stopped once you told him you were uninterested.", "NTA he couldn't take a hint and when you flat out refused he kept pushing, that's on him. I'd talk to your boss to make sure both sides of the story are in the open because if he's left to only say his side he could get you in trouble. But I'd take the part of him not wanting to be on the same shift as a blessing.", "NTA more women should be direct like this, and stop trying to Sugarcoat things. Most guys like a direct answer like this.", "NTA\n\nHe was the one who was sexually harassing you. You shouldn\u2019t have had to say \u201cno\u201d more than once. I don\u2019t think his trip to HR is going to go the way he thinks it is.", "NTA.  You said you weren\u2019t attracted to him. Not that he was unattractive. Huge difference.  Also. When your bosses come to talk to you about this. Keep your cool and let them know how many times you tried to let him down gently and the he PERSISTED.  Just cuz he likes you you are under no obligation to like him back", "My question is- what did he want to hear from you? He would have been upset with any reason you gave for not being interested anyway so why get upset for something he himself set up? He hurt his own feelings by doing that nta", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your job to make men feel good about themselves.", "NTA. If he bring it up again simply tell him, preferably while others can hear if you are a bit petty, \u201cI\u2019m not attracted to you. Among other reasons because nothing is as unattractive as a man not respecting the word No.\u201d", "This needs to be taken very seriously. That young girl that was murdered by her coworker at Walgreens should have been.", "NTA. He asked a question. You answered. You weren\u2019t mean and didn\u2019t laugh or make aspersions on his lifestyle, income, or body type. You just didn\u2019t feel any attraction. Nothing wrong with that. Your coworker apparently thinks he\u2019s Gods gift and doesn\u2019t like being told no. It\u2019s for the best that you not work closely with him again because a person that doesn\u2019t take being scorned very well can be dangerous. If you close the store after dark, make sure someone goes with you to your car. Don\u2019t take chances.", "NTA - and what he did was harassment. Get to your manager right away and report the co-worker because he will not stop.", "NTA report him to HR. textbook definition of Sexual Harassment. Literally. Your situation is EXACTLT what HR videos play in employee orientations.\n\nBoy meets girl or works together\n\nBoy asks girl out. Girl not interested. Boy is persistent and keeps asking. Boy retaliates against girl by making her work life difficult via various methods. Also, save screenshots of any texts between you and him and record him.", "NTA. I hope you can talk to your manager about this because this is unprofessional creepy harassment (from 25m).", "NTA. Tell him to stop harassing you and tell management. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA! You should have lied??? You *did* lie, to spare his feelings, and it didn\u2019t work! Please report him to your manager.", "Nta it's not your job to cradle his fragile male ego.", "NTA, he asked. You answered. Sounds like he did not catch the hint and its not even like you insulted the guy.", "NTA, he didn't take the hint, and then he asked why you wouldn't date him. You didn't say he was ugly, just that he's not what you find attractive. You might want to clue your manager in on this exchange, or talk to your company's HR, because it sounds like he's not taking this well, and things could get really weird.", "NTA, as others have said, please go to HR with this as soon as you can. Let them know you are uncomfortable working with him given what just happened. Please keep up your guard up, as he could possibly escalate.", "NTA. It's not your job to make every insecure man feel safe. He deliberately was not taking hints and forced the issue on you. It would be best if he did work a different shift because he is not going to let this go and will make it a hostile work environment. In fact, if I were you, I would also put in a report with your manager and HR so that when, not if, but when he starts getting more hostile to you you've already started a paper trail.", "NTA I suggest you go to the manager first. \n\nBecause I bet he would leave out the part of the story where he continuously bothered (read harassed) you with his unwanted attention: you brushed off his hints (saying you are not looking for a relationship) and said no when he asked you out several time, yet he kept it up confessing to you and then demanding you to explain why you don't want him. I bet he would say he asked you out and you immediately told him he is ugly so he doesn't want to work the same shift because you create a hostile work environment. Skipping everything else and especially the fact he is the reason for the workplace tension. \n\nIf he speaks to the manager before you, he can spin the story and it can effect your job. (people generally believe more to the person they here the story from first, often it's harder to prove your side when you are the second to tell the story)", "You need to talk to your manager about this - this is harassment, and it needs to stop.  Your lot is life is not to make someone feel better about himself if he continues to thrust himself upon you (figuratively).  This is also the type of guy who will stalk you.  You have told him clearly and nicely that you are not into him, but he won't leave it and now blames you for making him uncomfortable, because its only his feelings that count.  His manager needs to have a long conversation with him about a work ethic (walked away from his job because you upset him) and appropriate behaviour in the workplace and in real life.  Clearly, he did not learn these lessons at home.  And typically, he will always think it's your fault.  If your manager isn't willing to do anything about it, you need to remind him that harassment is against the law, he knows what's going on and therefore he has an obligation to regulate the situation.  Good luck.", "NTA I had to tell a coworker when he asked me out that I wasn\u2019t interested. I let him we don\u2019t have anything in common and I don\u2019t want to date a coworker.", "NTA, he asked and you answeed honestly.  If he's uncomfortable it is his own fault.\n\nSaying you are not attracted to someone does NOT mean that you think they are ugly or even unattractive.  It might not even have a thing to do with how they look at all, sometimes some behaviors can make someone unattractive to another person.", "NTA.  Not being attracted to someone does not equal that person not being good looking!  Personally I'm not that attracted to looks.  Smart and funny is my thing.      Also, not every girl is attracted to every boy.  Even if he is seemingly perfect.  A coworker being polite, friendly-ish and being willing to shoot the shit at work is not an invitation.  He has a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA. He shouldn't have asked if he didn't want to know.", "NTA He has been sexually harassing you report him", "NTA.\n\nAnd immediately go to your supervisor/HR if your small business has one and report that shit immediately. He's the one out of line here, not you. And abandoning your job because your coworker won't date you? That's creepy as well as unprofessional.", "Yes girl it was the best move!!

Everything that followed your initial gentle let down was inappropriate in a workplace. Saying you are not attracted to someone is not the same as insulting them or saying they are objectively unattractive.\nWrite down everything that has happened so far in detail with time/dates. If you have other documentation like texts to friends keep these. Then go to HR or manager and tell them about how you were left to close on your own and why. Make sure you emphasize that you are very uncomfortable with his unprofessional behavior both regarding his unwanted advances and his abandonment of his shift.", "NTA.\n\nBless you, you\u2019re 23. You\u2019re going to experience this same phenomenon many, many times throughout your life: someone hitting on you and using your attempts to remain friendly and polite as fuel to keep pushing in hopes of wearing you down, then exploding and calling you any number of colorful epithets when you\u2019re forced to be direct. From the book The Gift of Fear (which you should definitely read):\n\nDeclining to hear \u201cno\u201d is a signal that someone is either seeking control or refusing to relinquish it. With strangers, even those with the best intentions, never, ever relent on the issue of \u201cno,\u201d because it sets the stage for more efforts to control.

My attractive fun mother was 70ish and alone and at a happy point again in her life. Her best answer to the what do you look for in a man question was \"a handyman, lawn guy, a chauffeur and they all go home before dinner\"", "NTA\n\nThis was pretty much harrassment, asking you such personal questions, making it clear he wanted to date you. But I understand it might seem unfriendly not to answer... it's so tough to keep in professional, especially in some work environments. \n\nBut for now, tell him you've never said he was ugly, just that you're not attracted to him. He created the situation, and you had to set a boundary.\n\n Tell him also, \"this is why asking a coworker out is not good plan. What did you think was going to happen if I said no? Did it never occur to you that I might? Now you're upset, and I've done nothing wrong but try to do my job without accepting your advances. This is not my fault.

I will never date a coworker.\"", "NTA\n\nYou had already told him that you weren\u2019t looking for anyone at the moment and that was basically the lie he asked for.

He was pretty much THE celebrity crush when I was a child & teenager, but I never saw what the big deal was.", "I\u2019ve met Hugh Laurie and he\u2019s incredibly nice.", "I have worked in retail and food service, and like 80% of it was highly unethical \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, it's not always a good idea, but it's not inherently unethical unless there's chain-of-command muddling going on.", "HR isnt our friend anyway.  HR departments exist to help the business not get sued.  In this case if she reports and nothing comes of it, she  has a case she can bring to her state Department of Labor.", "I can't stop laughing at this \ud83e\udd23", "Hence the quotation marks - hopefully inferring the fact that the \u201cexotic\u201d was meant as /s. Also, citizen of the Cherokee Nation here so I try to be sensitive about those types of labels. Also, on a related note, I\u2019m a huge \u2018Reservation Dogs\u2019 fan.", "I think I know why they're like that. Imagine, if you will  that same man at 5 years old, who just found out mom will give him anything he wants if he keeps asking. Fast forward ten years, and she keeps reassuring her little prince that those girls are rejecting him because THEY suck, not because of any flaws in her sweet boy.", "I LOVE Mandy Patinkin \ud83e\udd70 i was lucky enough to date a guy who looked exactly like him (the normal Mandy look but with I\u00f1igo's long curly hair). For some reason i find him specially hot in Yentl lol", "You just described how I feel. When I told a male friend this he called me a liar lol. But it\u2019s really just that energy/personality can make me think the world of someone. Not that hard to make me attracted to someone lol.", "He's one I don't get. I know a lot of people find him attractive, but I don't see it at all. Then again, he kind of resembles Keanu Reeves who I do think is good looking.  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nEdit: left out a word", "Good lord y\u2019all are thirsty.", "Jeff Goldblum walking out of the desert in Independence Day. Rawr!", "Oh my, saw him in Predators, fabulous  gorgeous nose....and great eyes, for sure. Happy to hang out on an alien planet with him!  I liked guys whose faces had some character, not absolutely perfect, as I wasn't either, just a medium pretty sort of girl. Went for personality, tbh. That's what lasts.", "Ooh, lemme guess! GSP?", "He's pretty hot on fight club, now days he's just aged and  being damn near 60 he's losing his  appeal.", "I also think he's a good actor, perhaps he's not taken as seriously because of his long standing \"heartthrob\" status?", "Yeah most incels aren't ugly, it's their bitter misogyny that - surprise surprise - drives women away! But blaming your looks is easier than growing as a person I guess.", "> However, they have a nasty attitude about women and it seems many of them also feel they \"deserve\" supermodel \"11s\" when they are in the 6-8 range.\n\nAdded to that, 40+ year old very average guys who think 18 year old gorgeous girls are just longing to be hit on by them.", "It\u2019s the voice and the charisma for me", "Zach is objectively adorable, tbh.", "Totally!  Apparently, Paul Neumann felt similarly about his career. His daughter recently gave an interview promoting his autobiography and said that\u2019s pretty much exactly how he saw himself and having a lot of conflicted and complicated feelings about his career trajectory.", "It was awful. He and Tom Cruise were so miscast. Once the seething rage subsided  I found the whole thing hilarious. He was comically shitty. It wasn\u2019t on par with his other stuff around then that was nothing to write home about either. I think he was self-aware enough to be like, \u201cWho the fuck are we kidding with this bullshit?\u201d and his performance was shot to hell on account of it.", "girl same!!! Chris Hens does absolutely nothing to me, but Tucci.. omg \ud83e\udd75 i  specially love him in Shall we dance and Easy A.", "I admit I love all the Chris\u2019s.", "Thank you. I'm  not here to claim men have it worse.  Nor that we should ignore the bad acts men do."]}
