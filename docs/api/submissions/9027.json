You should have switched out the Switch for something like, I dunno, a $10 bill during his turn if you really didn't want him to get it.

I get that you told him he couldn\u2019t win and thought what are the odds. But the reality of playing  and game and then OMG, it landed on me, is different. Why put him in that place? The excitement for a kid and then it\u2019s nope, we told you. Yes, you did. But for him it doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nDid you have to play the game again for someone else to win the switch?\nPull the switch out when it was his term would have been the better thing to do. \n\nYou were trying to do a good thing, but this situation doesn\u2019t feel good.

I see why you continued and I applaud you for having the difficult conversation first. It just sucks that he won. You probably should have excluded him from that for that reason - just in case - but again, you set up the rules ahead of time and if they're upset, that's on them for continuing to play.", "YTA.

You should have held off on having the Switch for a prize until another night.", "Soft YTA\n\nTotally agree that the prize was purely for your family and not some random kid you weren't expecting\n\nI know you explained the rules but this isn't an adult and obviously the kid was upset\n\nYou should have either held off offering this prize or not let them participate in that game at all", "NTA, you live and learn. You don't work to gift toys, gifts to a kid you've never met, that you never knew was coming.\n\nHe'll forget about it in a few months, not a big deal?", "YTA - so you had a game with rules and a prize. And a 10 YEAR OLD KID played and won ... and you decided to make the CHILD feel incredibly unwelcome by excluding him public from the prize he rightly won.  Wow. So WHO is the child here?", "YTA - for calling the kid a little shit and letting him play knowing he could win. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have let him play.", "YTA\n\nIt's a kid, I think it would have been better to give away the Nintendo another day. Even though you said you wouldn't give it to him, he's still a kid who probably doesn't understand why he alone couldn't win it.\n\nYou shouldn't have let him play that specific game in the first place. children are annoying sometimes, but as adults we should put ourselves in their shoes too.", "NTA. That kid was an UNINVITED guest in your house that the family did not ask your permission to bring. Granted maybe you should put the switch away for another time, but I get it. Why take that away from another kid there just to spare the feelings of a ten year old you just met whom by their age should understand what no means. You got it for a FAMILY MEMBER to win. You also made it VERY CLEAR before the game even started that it was only going to a niece or nephew and EVERYBODY AGREED! If anyone had an issue with this, THATS when they should have spoken up. I don\u2019t blame you AT ALL for not wanting to give away $200 console to a kid you\u2019ve never seen before in your life.

Man up, give the kid the switch and next time handle it differently. It's called learning from your mistakes.", "YTA. You should have just canceled the game or just not let him play.", "YTA. Why call him a little shit? That makes you an AH.", "YTA - you created the situation / conflict (involving a child, no less) when you could have completely avoided it by just saving the prize for next time.
