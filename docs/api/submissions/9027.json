Opting to play a different game would have cost OP nothing, it's not like switches have an expiration date.  The idea of going ahead with the game, after rigging it against an innocent 10 year old leaves a bad taste in my mouth, even if the 10 year old was warned ahead of time.  It doesn't exactly take a crystal ball to see that this idea could end poorly.  We don't even know exactly how badly it did end.  Did they continue playing until another kid won the Switch, which seems especially cruel?  Or did they not give out the switch at all, in which case they'll just be playing that game another day anyway?  I don't really think OP's the AH here, just a bit foolish for going about it the way they did.

I'm also \"uncle\" to several friends' kids that I see regularly. I've coached kids sports teams for multiple years at that age group. I've taught classes for 10-11 year-olds. I've volunteered with the Special Olympics in that age range. As a teen, I taught skating classes in that age group. In sum, I have extensive experience and close relationships with kids at that age, how about you? \n\nI'm well versed on their ability to grasp rules or their ability to be excluded based on some criteria (e.g., you won yesterday so you can't win again today or letting the younger kids win).

The lack of empathy for a 10 year old, who is not an adult, nor are they emotionally mature enough to really understand why adults can be so cruel, is disappointing.

We had a good financial year (for once, it\u2019s not going to happen this year), and if I wanted to do something like that, I would have either taken the Switch out of the game, or given it to the child.

I recognize the fact that seeing his nieces/nephews or young cousins playing with their brand new Switch that they one at their Uncle's family game night would give him a lot of feelings fulfillment, but that's his right.
