That would have solved the problem for you.\n\nNTA", "YTA, so cruel to the child. Ok there was a mistake to bring the child but after that you decided to make the child feel unwelcome. You could at least give the price another time but you decided that you want to brag with your price even if this is means to upset a child", "YTA\u2026.no hospitality, no shame and you excluded a child lmao. 10 is not old enough to handle that. You could have just done the game for your nieces and nephews another time if it was that important for one of them to have it. \n\nI get they weren\u2019t invited but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to treat them like trash. If you were already gonna treat them like that, you should\u2019ve just told them to leave from the get. But you let the kid stay and that means you should\u2019ve been more hospitable. Have some class. \n\nMy family would never.", "It sounds like these events occur somewhat regularly.  Is this the first time someone ever brought a friend?", "YTA. \nI agree you shouldn't have to buy a stranger a switch, so take the switch out the equation.\nYou could have saved that prize for another time when it was just family. \nWhat you did was crule to that kid.", "NTA. Why was there a random kid brought to your immediate family gathering\u2026 the relative who thought this was appropriate is the AH. \nAlso you made it clear he couldn\u2019t win the switch. Just an all around awkward situation that could have been avoided had they not brought a stranger to your family game night.", "ESH. The kid agreed, but no 10 year old is going to honor that lol. Nor should they as they are a child and lack the cognitive ability. I think OP acted rationally, and in hind sight they should have just saved the switch until next time. And if I\u2019m being honest, it does seem like a dick move to take it from them. To be clear, I would do the exact same thing but still hard to justify", "YTA for even playing the game with this kid there. You should have altered the game at least so that the Switch was never an issue.", "light YTA, the smart thing to do would have been to keep the switch out of the prize pool until a week where it was only family members present. I can't think of a situation in which it's cool to show off a special prize like that, that one kid is told they specifically are excluded from any shot at. That's just gonna make the random kid, who came here to have a good time and didn't know what to expect, feel singled out and excluded.", "YTA\n\nFirst for calling him a \"little shit\".  He is a 10 year old who won a game and got emotional when you he couldn't have the prize. Very predictable.  Even if you told him, you know why? He is 10 years old.\n\nYou should have said the switch prize will be next game night, and just said whoever wins gets  $20.\n\nAsking him to play without being able to win is mean. Most 10 year olds would be upset. You certainly made it clear he was a second class guest.\n\nIt is a shame nobody told you he was coming, but pivot adjust, adapt.", "Right. Like I get where OP is coming from but also, obviously a 10 year old kid is going to be upset about that.", "To be honest I don\u2019t think the switch was a good idea in general. Generous of OP for sure, but think about the fact that for kids that age a $300 console is essentially unobtainable aside from gifts. I\u2019m not sure they have the emotional maturity to compete for a prize that big at what\u2019s otherwise a fun family game night.\n\nImagine a 10 year old watching his brother/cousin take home a switch, which is at the very top of a lot of kids\u2019 wish lists, and play it all day long because he edged him in a silly can game. It\u2019s just a bit over the top.", "NTA play stupid games, be disqualified from winning stupid prizes", "Yeah agreed..i see OP point...but things changed..either stash the switch for next time or winner takes all..no its fair game for all except that guy...i have to judge YTA for segregating a 10 year old from the reward pool...just a ass move at that point", "This is exactly what makes him the asshole...he could have just put it away for the next family game night instead of waving it in the kid's face and saying he can't get it.", "Yeah, how dare a 10 year old doesn't understand that he will be excluded, suck it up sunshine!\n\nOP should have just removed the switch as the prize and offered something else.", "The prize should have been saved. The kid should not be excluded. This is basic manners.", "Yeah, I agree definitely ESH", "This", "Most of the time this game is like with a dozen or so prizes on the table and one of them just so happens to be bigger but everyone gets something", "Seriously... pitting kids against each other with a prize like that on the line seems like a guaranteed way to make sure somebody is unhappy. But maybe that's just the way I feel because of how my family did things. We always tried to make sure thing were as fair & equal as possible because we didn't want any kid to resent another.", "Yeah, I think a of this sub has never actually been 'othered' before. It's crazy how many people think this is ok behavior to exclude a 10 year old and essentially bully him. I grew up with very little support from extended family members but I remember a whole bunch of events where others fully included me in their events and never made me feel like I was different. I can't imagine how damaging it would be going to an event and having something like this happen.", "OP's family is obviously very different from mine but I'm still in disbelief at the idea of having family members compete against each other over a prize like that. My family never does \"white elephant\" gift exchanges for the same reason - we don't want to pit family members against each other, especially children.", "I agree. It sucks that the family brought an unexpected guest, but a 10 year old is not as mature as some people claiming he should be (\"10 is old enough to understand\", \"10 is too old to cry over this\"). It's crappy to even tell a kid that he can play but he's not allowed to win the best prize (but everyone else is). OP should have just saved the Switch for the next event.\n\nI think ESH except for all the kids involved (10 year old was definitely not a \"little shit\"--he acted like a 10 year old).", "It isn't about the prize, it's about feeling excuded and that your are 2nd class. That stings.", "Because he didn\u2019t intend to give the gift to a random stranger, he intended to give it to his family members.

The fact he didn't do this is totally an asshole move.", "Put the game on hold until another family event without strangers there?", "I doubt the switch was advertised ahead of time..and i doubt after op mentioned the switch was a grand prize...random relative steps aside and there is a whole ass kid just standing there out of thin air..seems probably op had the opportunity to address this whole situation differently", "Just save the switch. Excluding a child from a game is not \"being respectful\".", "Basic manners is not bringing someone uninvited to somebody else's house.", "Yeah that is a really dumb game to play with children and a $300 gaming console.  How much do you imagine prize #2 is worth?", "So what happened with the Switch?  Did you continue playing until another kid won it, or did you end the game with nobody winning it?", "Oh, I know. Kids will be kids. Speaking from experience. I always felt terrible when not getting a prize of some kind. Lotteries from school included. Its why kids work so hard to sell candies and magazines in school, we expected some kind of reward. I was a huge crybaby and really sensitive also really shy so I tried to bottle it up.\n\nBig mistake.It hurt doubly so. \n\nImagine putting all your effort into winning, and still the grand prize goes to someone else.\n\n *Your heart sinks, pressure builds, tears gather in your eyes, and you want to sob.* \n\n*But you can't.*\n\nYou have to put on a happy face for your friend. Be mature. Congratulate them. \n\nBecause if you aren't you're jealous, petty, and not a team player. \n\nThey're kids. It hurts. Someone's always going to cry when they lose.  Even if they don't win, you can't say they aren't feeling some level of sadness or jealousy. A small prize is still a prize. But when the prize is as big as a switch? No, that's way too big. No kids going to be happy losing out on one. Family included.\n\n*Especially, if they win and still don't get the prize.* Even if you mentioned beforehand, it's only for nieces and nephews. He's a kid, he did his best and had a hope of receiving a prize. Kid's a brat? What kid isn't bratty at times? \n\nMaybe he hadn't listened? Maybe he wasn't told directly, or the parents told him otherwise? Either way OP that switch guaranteed at least one kid would openly cry, the others as I said would grin and bear it. They would be mopey though. All of them.", "Nah, people are allowed to cry, that's not something that is always controllable. It's the action they take after crying that matters.", "\"Family gathering\" sorrybht random children are not family. They should t have brought the child without saying something first. The only AH is the adults that brought some random kid", "He wasn't welcome. He wasn't invited. He was allowed to participate and play, it's absurd for a 10 year old to expect to just be given a switch after he was told he isn't getting one.", "And that's not OPs fault. It's a FAMILY gathering. The only assholes would be the adults that brought some random child to a family gathering unprompted and unannounced", "The child didn\u2019t know they weren\u2019t invited.", "I know he didn't intend to - OP didn't intend to have someone who isn't a family member play the game, either.  But the kid was there, allowed to participate in the game, OP was fine with those things, and the kid would enjoy the prize as much as any other kid.  I'm asking what the reason is that OP didn't want the kid to have the prize for winning the game that OP was clearly fine with him playing.", "And that was an AH move.", "Just wait til you turn 40\u2026 it\u2019s an even bigger gamble!", "Who says that will happen? Since it's clearly ok to bring whoever you want to your relatives' house without asking. Maybe every kid wants to bring their friend along now, and the special family gathering is ruined by a bunch of strangers. Maybe the next gathering doesn't include all the kid cousins, and now they have to wait again for another gathering. \n\nEveryone is trying to label OP as shitty for dealing with his family's shitty behavior, and then the kid's shitty behavior after he didnt get his way.", "Because the child of someone he doesn't even know threw a fit after he was told he couldn't have it before the game was even played? Life isn't fair. Get over it and learn to deal with it is all that should be said about this kid. He isn't entitled to the switch OP purchased his family and was even told he wasn't able to win it before things were even started", "Two wrongs don't make a right. Other parents were wrong to bring the kid unannounced. It doesn't excuse OP for being mean and rude to the child.", "Exactly!! I can't believe how many ppl want to say the kid is the AH.  \n\nAnd it's a freaking switch! That's like a Holy Grail for a kid that age.  I have a ten year old and I can NOT imagine telling him or someone his age he doesn't qualify to win that prize.  It's devastating to someone that age.  It hurts my heart to think of that poor kids' reaction.  \n\nI will say that I come from a family where if you are there and involved, you are part of the family, even for one night.  We would never tell a kid they couldn't win a prize.  If that was the case, that game or prize just wouldn't be \"on the table.\"", "It didn't say that he threw a tantrum, it said that he cried. Which isn't manipulative on its own. The kid just got excited and then disappointed, he's not a little shit for crying.", "decent point but when a child cries because it doesn't get its way that's a learned behavior", "So because of that the OP can make the child feel unwelcome? Because he didn\u2019t brought the child?", "It's hella petty to make a kid feel unwanted.\n\nAs a kid, they have no control over where they are taken.", "Then the people who brought him should have explained that.", "The new prize? $40. Not hard. And no kids have to be excluded.", "Of course, the comment sections here are so bizarre, immature and outrageously judgmental that they could only be the product of a bunch of angry 14 year olds", "Exaaaactly!", "If you think that crying automatically means manipulation or should be punished out of a child, perhaps you shouldn't work with them. \n\nRecognizing that children are not emotionally mature at ten is not infantalizing them.  For all your interaction with children, I'm astounded by your ignorance of them..\n\nCrying is not automatically manipulative.  Sure, some do.  But a ten year old crying over this is just as likely--or even more likely--to be grappling with managing their emotional response to the situation than trying to manipulate it.  I wouldn't leave my kid in the care or guidance of someone who saw kids' emotions as disparagingly as you do.", "And dangle golden eggs infront of their faces whilst repeating \"Not for you.\"", "That's how I read it, too. Why are people so determined to hate on a ten year old?", "Agreed, this kid didn't invite himself to this thing, he was brought by a different family and probably didn't realize the dynamics. Just because he knew the rules doesn't mean that it didn't hurt to be excluded. Calling a 10 year old manipulative with no other context is just wild speculation and just makes them sound like they just hate kids", "Yes, but he was also told he wouldn\u2019t win the Switch. So he knew he was just playing for fun. OP (or the family who brought him) could have given him $5-$10 as a cash prize for doing the hard can thing, but this kid was told in advance.\n\nHonestly, if my 10 year old came home from someone else\u2019s family gathering with a Switch, I\u2019d return it and explain to my kid that that\u2019s too much and not an appropriate prize for a non family member.", "Nah, children cry because they lack emotional regulation and are sad. OP didn't say he screamed and threw a tantrum, just that he cried.", "Exactly, like how TF is it the child's fault for all this? Plus people are just assuming he was crying because he \"didn't understand the rules\" without even stopping to think maybe that change in the rules is the EXACT reason why he was crying. He won and knew he wasn't going to get it, I'm sure other people wouldn't feel good in that situation either, winning a game where you're suppose to win a big prize but because you're not associated with a family not even getting it. I mean granted, if someone older knew that they would have just not played, but do you think that's going on in a 10 year-olds mind? They probably didn't want to feel excluded.", "Exactly.  I was raised if you have guests at any gathering they get treated the same (if not better) as the family.  If the guest is a kid, even MORE so!  \n\nReddit has a hate boner for kids sometimes and I don't get it.", "Why don't you sit out of this conversation?", "That's true, thats probably why he didn't ban the kid from playing. \n\nCan you understand why he warned both the kid and the family that brought him that the switch wouldn't be able to go to anyone but the relatives he bought it for? \n\nIf not, you might want to PayPal OP the cost of a switch. It's not exactly a \"petty\" price.", "Literally, and the people claiming he was crying to be manipulative make me so mad. I've been a kid that was told I must be trying to be manipulative after crying while being verbally abused. I was just sad, like this kid was.", "To be fair, a lot of people forget what it's like to be a kid until they have them or are around them.\n\nBut a 10 year old's gonna cry about all kinds of shit.

This wasn't one of them.", "Crying may be very different, from sobbing to a whole tantrum. Crying because you're sad is absolutely ok and is simply a reaction. Tantrums, on the other hand, are a manipulation. I was originally imagining something more of a tantrum, so maybe I'm wrong. The kid shouldn't expect the switch after being told \"no\" (\"You can't be disappointed when you expect nothing\" and all that) and understanding that you can't get something is not that hard, but yes, controling reaction is hard. We don't know the details, so we don't know if it was a simple uncomfortable reaction to sadness or a tantrum based on unfulfilled expectations...", "There's a surprising amount of people on reddit who actively hate children. It's weird.", "Sure, all of that is true, but for a second he probably got excited, and then remembered that he doesn't get the switch. He's allowed to cry and feel sad.

Is giving away the switch to a random kid \"fair\" towards OP's niblings? No. The kid expected something he can't possibly get.
