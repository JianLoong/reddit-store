It would have been easy to just choose a different game or eliminate the prize.", "YTA\n\nThat's just mean. He's ten, he's not gonna understand why he can't have the price be won, and it's kinda shitty to offer a prize to only some of the people.", "NTA", "Calling a child a little shit? YTA by default. He won a difficult game\u2026congrats in order. \nYou set up a terrible game reward for just one little child having different rules.", "NTA, you got put into an awkward spot.  My best advice would have been to say \"Today is practice night!  Only the minor prizes are on the table.\"", "Question: was the kid aware that he couldn\u2019t win the switch before playing? You say everyone agreed, did the kid agree before hand too?", "ESH, the kid was 10 so you can't expect them to fully understand but I'd have been annoyed at an unexpected kid winning something meant for a family member.", "Nta, seriously, who's gonna give a random kid a brand new switch that was intended for family? Especially when the people bringing him didn't even notify you they were bringing an extra along.  I probably would have told the kid to sit that game out though.", "NTA but you learned a lesson\n\nWhen I have my child and we are going to a store, somehow there is always a random kid that joins up. I have to tell my kid that we can go to the store after or I have to buy the new kid the same amount of stuff or it's not fair.\n\nBest save the good gifts when it's just you and the family to avoid issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wound up buying three kids gifts that day as my kid refused to understand what I was saying but understood after when she got 1/3 gifts and the friends left because I only have so much money.\n\nBeing a parent sucks sometimes.", "NTA because you told everyone upfront before playing the game.  Maybe you could have given the kid $20.00 for winning the game night but you are NTA.", "nta", "NTA but for next time, maybe play a different game or change the prize?\n\nOr to avoid that situation in the future entirely, establish a rule that people should ask before inviting another person to game night (it should go without saying, but it has already happened once so maybe the boundary needs to be explicitly stated).\n\nI feel for the kid, but you\u2019re not wrong.  You were put on the spot and that\u2019s not really ok.", "YTA.\n\nNot because you don't want to give the Switch to some unknown kid, but for insisting to play this game with this prize when he's there. Of course it's annoying to have unannounced guests, but he isn't the one to blame for the situation. This is a little kid, nothing 'logical' you say will spare him from feeling excluded and wronged.", "Very soft ESH.\n\nOn the one hand, maybe a switch isn't the best of prizes. Think about it. What if one of your nieces/nephews won? Are you telling me they wouldn't put up a stink when they lost? Feel jealous, or cry? Money/snacks would be the better option. The winner gets a larger amount but no one goes empty handed. Or keep silent on the prize altogether until the last moment, don't advertise until the time comes to play when you're sure it's only family. That way if it isn't. No harm no foul. You won't be caught in this position again.\n\nOn the other, who in their right minds brings a friend to a family function? It isn't a BBQ, please always make sure invites say 'family only' in the future if they aren't already.", "YTA: Here's this super cool prize that anyone can win except for you.  He's ten, that's too young for that level of maturity.  A lot of 20 year olds in that position would have a hard time being graceful. \n\n Next time make up an excuse and set it aside for another night.", "NTA.  The kid wasn't invited & you told them up front he couldn't have the switch.  The family that brought him is the AH.", "Mild YTA - 10 is old enough to understand the rule but young enough to still struggle with regulating his emotions around it so the better thing to do would have been to swap out the prize this time and had them play for the switch another time, as the result if he did end up winning was predictable, but also you were put on the spot and made a suboptimal decision, it happens. Take the lesson to not tempt fate next time but it's not the end of the world for anyone involved.", "YTA - it doesn\u2019t matter if you didn\u2019t know him, you let him play so if he won he won. If it was that important to you you should have held off on the prize until only the people you wanted to play were there.", "NTA Only because you let him know before he played the game that he couldn\u2019t win the switch and honestly That\u2019s something that\u2019s expensive and of course she wanted to go to a family member not a random person that you don\u2019t know", "YTA, for going ahead and playing the game. If it's only for the kids in the family, wait until only those kids are present.", "YTA", "exactly, just put that game on hold for a session.", "Kid was a little shit for trying to get something by turning on the waterworks. He's 10, not 4.", "How are they going to decide ownership amongst 6 kids across 4 families?", "Lol thinking a 10 year old can emotionally regulate themselves in this situation. Also, \u201cgracious enough to let him play\u201d? The kid was brought by another family. The OP isn\u2019t the sole arbiter of the entire game night. \n\nThe other family sucks for bringing the kid. The OP sucks for just not saving the switch for another time. The kid is not at fault here.", "This is the way. You don't exclude children. You rearrange on the fly. \n\nThat said, whoever brought the 'outside' child should honour the prize \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA absolutely!! \nwhy not just make the prize 40$??? \nthen everyone can win it. \n\n\ni've been in situations like this and it feels so gross. \nthe 10 year old didnt choose to invite himself. he thought he was going to a fun party. \n\nand you should not have given this kid a nintendo switch without talking to his parents. but like, you could have absolutely given EVERYONE the same prize chance. \n\nyou have taken the joy out of this kids victory and made him feel unwelcome.", "Glad it's not just me.", "One of the rules, stated before the game commenced, was that the guest kid was ineligible for the Switch prize.\n\nWould it have been better to exclude him from the game altogether, just have him sit on the sidelines and watch everyone else take part?\n\nNo solution to this would have been ideal, but OP made a reasonable decision given the circumstances.", "The kid is 10, not 4. That's plenty old enough to understand the rules laid out to them. Did you not play carnival games as a kid? How old were you before you understood one win at the beanbag toss wasn't going to get you the 4 foot teddy bear? \n\nAnd if he didn't let the kid participate, then he looks like an AH for excluding the kid because he's just a child.", "Then he would've been the AH for not letting the kid even play. It doesn't appear the OP wasn't willing to let the random kid win a lesser prize, he just couldn't win the big prize.", "Excluding the kid from the game would have been the asshole move. Everyone else is participating and the kid just has to sit and watch?\n\nAllowing him to play but making it clear beforehand that he wasn't allowed to win the prize was the best option imo.\n\nIt's not clear if OP had made any of the family kids aware of the Switch prize before the unexpected guest kid turned up. If not, then saving the Switch until the next family gathering would have been the best way to handle it.", "Maybe they could have made the kid another rep for the family. Be like hey only family can win the switch but if you want to play you can help give your friend win. Maybe I was too chill as a kid though, I would have been so excited to be the reason my friend got a switch which we could play when I was at their house. Might not work on some kids.", "He should have come up with a different prize.", "Who's the kid friends with? That's who he's competing for....seems an easy solution", "Nah, you\u2019re fine.  He WAS being a little shit. \n\nThis kid, like the others, played to win, was of course hoping, even thinking he would. \n\nHowever: He never thought once that if he did, he would be denied the switch. The word \u201cno\u201d is probably not said to him much. \nHe was old enough to understand and accept the terms of participating, which he did. \n\nHe\u2019s 10, not 5 or 6, the teary tantrums are a manipulation tactic that has worked his entire life.\n\nHonestly, your language is tame, he behaved like a fucking brat. The adults in this child\u2019s life   exemplify a major reason why teachers are increasing unwilling to continue accepting shit pay to put up with, in your words, \u201clittle shits\u201d.\n(Source: r/teaching r/teachers r/entitledparents etc etc etc)", "\u2026where are you from?", "same. those feelings have stuck with me", "yeah he'll probably be humiliated that he cried over a toy forever. what a shame", "It\u2019s really not. It\u2019s cruel to make a 10 year old play a game where they can\u2019t win the same prize as everyone else. They might say ok, but when they win their emotions are going to take over. \n\nIt would have been so much easier to just save the switch for the next game night with family only", "I honestly disagree. 10 years old is pretty young yet and can be unpredictable years.", "Thank you! I'm very surprised how controversial this post was! I thought it would be almost unanimous", "This is such a garbage tier analogy. Telling a 10 year old kid they can play but they are barred from getting the prize is incredibly shitty and not at all the same thing as a kid realizing that winning a carnival game once doesn\u2019t get them the biggest prize. 10 year olds do not have the emotional regulation for this situation and shouldn\u2019t be put in this situation.", "If the kid can\u2019t win the big prize, that\u2019s not exactly fair to the kid, and if the kid were to win it(as he did), that leaves out the other kids without anything.\n\nBest and lesser AH move if he is that against letting the kid win the big prize would be to either not allow the kid to play or just get rid of the Switch all together and only allow the small prize.", "Seems like an excellent option to me, I would have been stoked to help my friends win a switch cause it meant I would get to play it with them. \n\nThe kid just sounds entitled because at 10, you are old enough to understand the why of not being given a switch by your friends random family member.", "It takes work and effort to plan entertainment for 4 families and their kids. OP shouldn't have to scramble to come up with new entertainment because one of those families lacks basic manners. OP set out very reasonable rules and expectations in advance. The kid knew it and agreed to still play knowing he couldn't win the grand prize.", "Yeah while it sucks, OP should have just put it away for next time and gave whoever brought the kid a good reaming.", "That's not fair to the kids who didn't bring a friend.", "A place where they call children mean names behind their backs", "10 years old is more than old enough to understand the rules.", "If a 10 year old couldn't understand such a simple rule then he's got bigger problems than not winning a fancy prize.", "damned if you do, damned if you don't. Right?", "My family does this all the time it\u2019s so damn annoying.\n\nConstantly inviting friends to family events. Like when I was little I wanted my cousins there hanging out with me, not my cousins and their friends. Changes the dynamic.\n\nThat\u2019s just me being a petty kid though. But in recent years during Covid lockdowns we\u2019d have weekly dinner parties with my 80+ year old grandparents and they\u2019d STILL be bringing over friends and strangers we\u2019ve never met. That\u2019s when it really pissed me off. I thought that was so rude. My parents and I never do that, but my whole family (aunts, uncles, cousins) do it all the time.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to go \u2018hey can Susie and Billy come over with us for dinner tomorrow?\u2019 and a totally different thing to bring them unannounced to someone\u2019s house for like a birthday or Christmas or whatever. Shit IRKS me.", "It\u2019s tellingly unclear that this was a completely unprecedented event", "I said save it for next time, not throw it in the trash.  They'd still have the chance to win it - even more of a chance, actually.", "So? When did anyone stipulate the game had to be fair?", "That\u2019s so many countries\u2026 sadly.", "And being an adult is old enough to understand unintended consequences. \n\nLike I said before, the people with the random kid really created a terrible situation, but once they allowed the kid into the house, having exclusionary rules that target one child specifically is objectively a terrible thing to do.", "Honestly, it seems like whoever brought the non family members unannounced is TA here without a doubt.

Sounds more stupid and careless especially with grandparents in their 80s around.", "My family is the exact opposite. I am so sorry for you. You weren't being a petty kid. It's respecting boundaries and introverted families. I was raised \"you NEVER invite someone else along to NOT YOUR OWN event. Period. You never ask to include yourself, either.\" As an adult I'm put off when someone overhears and goes \"Oh that sounds like fun! Can we join?!\". Uhm...no. if I wanted you there I would have invited you.", "Look, you're defending a child throwing a tantrum after they were told that they couldn't have the switch if they won. Who is to say when next time will be? Or if all the parents will be alive for next time, or if all of the kids will be able to make it that time. It's perfectly fair to say we aare happy you're here and are welcome to participate but this prize is for family not you. You're suggesting the family skips over something clearly important to them and OP because someone not in their family is throwing a fit at their family event. \n\nHonestly, I'm glad I'm not in your family because it's clear you would prioritize the emotions and happiness of strangers over that of your own family.", "you're insufferable.", "They addressed the unintended consequences by laying out the rules in advance. I'm not going to feel bad that a kid wants an exception to the rules to be made and was told no. Once you allow an exception to the rules for one kid, why shouldn't a different kid claim they should get the Switch regardless of where the can stops when they ruled it. You've already set the precedent that exceptions will be carved out.", "So my grandparents could see us, they didn\u2019t leave the house otherwise. (I thought this was fairly dumb too.) No one was working/in school at the time and we were SUPPOSED to be quarantining. We\u2019d push tables apart so it\u2019d be one family group per table spaced out in the yard but\u2026 no one would keep that. And masks would constantly be coming down or people getting in each other\u2019s personal space to show phone stuff\u2026 it was pretty bad tbh. No one was ever sick but I\u2019m pretty sure if someone was we weren\u2019t ever doing enough to stop it. \n\nBut we\u2019d get \u2018friend I met at the gym\u2019 showing up (we weren\u2019t supposed to even be having gyms at the time) who no one really knew besides like my uncle for a few days.", "That\u2019s how my family is! You never invite yourself to someone else\u2019s plans that is rude! \n\nI had a guy friend that asked my plans for homecoming and immediately invited himself along. I gave him the ground rules of that\u2019s fine but only you and your date and no one else because last year when I actually invited him he invited a ton of people who all no showed last minute.I made reservations for dinner before homecoming for triple the amount of people 12 vs the original 4 I planned for. Only the original 4 came. \n\nAnyways after he invited himself a week later he came up to me and said hey I know you said don\u2019t invite anyone but I invited two girls plus their dates. I told him no and walked away from him. One of the girls I knew so I told her since it\u2019s not her or the other girls fault they are still more welcome to come but the original guy is no longer invited. They decided to do their own thing and the guy was pissed at me for uninviting him. We haven\u2019t talked since then and that homecoming was so much more stress free than the first one.", "\n*\"you're defending a child throwing a tantrum\"*\n\nLol no I'm not.  Kind of funny that you're throwing a tantrum over something that doesn't even involve you, I have to say.\n\nAnd engaging in personal attacks isn't exactly making you look like the reasonable party here.", "If you were all outside not so bad I suppose but my parents are elderly and there's no way they'd have allowed people around during the lockdowns."]}
