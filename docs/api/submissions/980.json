This cannot be the first time this dude has acted like this. There\u2019s no way. The way he talks to you is like verbal abuse. If he gets frustrated at the grocery store over something like that, how does he handle actual problems? My goodness. I would evaluate how he treats you in general and what he\u2019s said or done previously and see how much of a pattern there is. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to not see it since we are so close to it but with reflection it\u2019s obvious.", "NTA. But, scanning items is not the issue. There's something deeper going on. Or he's just an ah.", "NTA what the hell? I always scan the cold stuff first to make sure it all goes in the same bag. Idk if it's really going to help it stay cool till it gets home but that's what I do. Who pissed in his cheerios that morning smh", "The title says you started the fight, but the story says he started the fight. \n\nWhat makes you think you started it?", "NTA. Is your husband always this unpleasant to be around?", "NTA. He was being an impatient jerk and then not only blamed you but tried to make it out like he was doing you a favor by going with you to get food he's going to be eating too?  \n\n\nSounds like he's probably bothered by something else and is taking it out on you. You need to communicate to him that, first of all, you aren't going to tolerate being spoken to like that, and secondly, if there's an unrelated problem that's making him irritable, then he needs to express that like an adult.", "NTA\n\nHe went off on you saying \"nothing\" because he was intentionally trying to cause an argument already. How did the two of you end up at the grocery store together? He wanted to make this an unpleasant enough experience that if you'd stopped there because you were out doing something else, you'd remember this and not do so next time; or if you'd asked him to go with you, you'd remember this and just go do it yourself next time.\n\nHe's a lazy asshole who doesn't want to participate in common chores like shopping and is trying to set it up so you don't want to ask him to participate either.", "NTA, but your husband is. Wtf is wrong with him? And why are you with him?", "NTA - This entire story is about something that is not trivial. Him treating you like that is not trivial. You being constantly on edge around him and having to demonstrate your constant appreciation for anything he does is a seriously HUGE RED FLAG.", "NTA your husband sounds like an ass", "NTA... there is something else going on with your husband? Is this out of character?  I think this is different then feeling pressure on a grocery store.\nAnd yes, of course, there is no call to be this rude.", "NTA at all. Is this out of character for him or does he treat you like that regularly? It seems like there\u2019s something else going on here. Just for the sake of giving him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he\u2019s upset about something else (related or unrelated to you/your marriage) and doesn\u2019t know how to express it? Either way not cool, and he needs to communicate like an adult, but maybe worth having another convo about once he cools down.\n\nIf he\u2019s anything like this regularly, then run. That kind of nitpicking at you and being critical over small things followed by blowing up at you for being hurt by it is a perfect glimpse into what emotional abuse can look like. It breaks you down eventually, which makes you easier to control. In any case, you\u2019re NTA. I sincerely hope that she changes his behavior, or you get out of that relationship", "NTA\n\nHe had a stick up his ass about something. Either that or he figures if he acts like a jerk, you\u2019ll never ask him to go to the store with you again.\n\nI will say, he asked you what was wrong and you said \u201cnothing.\u201d  I can see not wanting to get into it while in the parking lot but you could have said, \u201ccan we talk about it later?\u201d   Then again, he probably would have blown up at that though too.", "If this was an isolated incident with your husband, maybe chalk it up to him having a bad day. But his choice of words gives me pause and makes me think he has done this before. What's with \"thanking him for even coming to the grocery store and you don't appreciate him\". Those are really specific and part of a pattern of abuse. Think about your other interactions and try and if this is a new thing, ask him about it and try to get to the bottom of it. If it isn't a new reaction for him, it's time to for some thoughtful reflection. And NTA", "NTA he WAS treating you that way then acted like an AH when talking about it. Grateful he went to the store with you? And what the heck is there to appreciate if you're going to act like a jerk the whole time. Goodness. You're not the issue. His behavior and the way he's talking to you are the issue.", "Well were you target fast which isn't very fast or Walmart fast which doesn't exist \ud83e\udd23. Fast is Aldi fast as they don't play.", "Nta. Jeezus you\u2019re married to that ass?", "NTA\nYou didn't start a fight, he did. \nYou're not lucky he came to the store.\nThe people in line were waiting their turn to do the same thing that you were. They weren't thinking about how fast or slow you were, they were thinking what an AH your husband is.", "BTW your husband started the fight, not you. It was actually nothing until he made it something", "NTA, but your husband seems to be", "NTA. I'm cringing for you. Do a lot of thinking about what your relationship is and isn't, at least for us if you won't do it for yourself.", "NTA, he did treat you like a child. If the order of items scanned mattered that much to him, he should just volunteer to to scan things. Hopefully this isn't something that happens often because it's giving major red flags.", "NTA\n\nHe is totally wrong here. Those checkouts are timed so you can't go very fast. If you try to scans quickly it stalls and yells at you (personal experience). Also, it's a grocery line not like a timed trial.", "NTA", "NTA. Hubby is pissed about something. But it isn't groceries. May not even have anything to do with you and you just got to be the lucky target of his anger.", "NTA and if my husband ever pulled this kind of crap on me, he would be walking home after I walked out and left him to deal with the groceries any way he pleased.  That behavior was childish and abusive and if this is not unusual behavior for him, I have to really wonder why on earth you are still with him.", "NTA. My husband doesn\u2019t go to the grocery store with me very often. He finds it anxiety inducing.  Between picking out items and having me ask questions and then checking out plus all the strangers, he just gets grumpy.  But yet he has never spoken to me like your husband did to you.  There\u2019s zero reason for him to start and argument with you and gaslight you.", "NTA Reason #10 to not use the self checkout. I wish that no one would use them, the stores are making you do the cashier's job, and not paying you or at least giving you a discount! I don't work for free...", "NTA. This isn't your issue at all. from the info you gave, it sounds like your husband has image issues with being stressed at people waiting for him (and you by association) Its a sign of insecurity.", "Nta", "NTA divorce this dude lmao", "NAH, I don't go through self checkout with my husband. It causes a fight every time. I hate how he hovers and he hates how I pack things. In the future, just send one person to the car. It's not a hill worth dying on.", "NtA.\n\nI can relate to your husband, at least in the parking lot. But the dude needs to learn to keep calm and just breath.\n\nAnd despite sometimes being an overly sensitive dick, I've never grabbed things out of my wife's hand and I've always been able to recognize my part in the fight.\n\nSounds like he didn't want to go grocery shopping at all, or has some social anxieties, either way he needs therapy. He should NOT take it out on you.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
