She's a babysitter for a friend of hers. \n\nSo here's the issue. My wife mentioned to me that this weekend, she had to go watch her friends 3 kids overnight tonight and tomorrow night. She hasn't been looking forward to it and has actually been dreading it. I was a little disappointed, but she's making money, so I can't be too upset. \n\nBut then, her car broke down yesterday night (Thursday). She can't drive it and she's ordering parts in today. She asked me to drive her to work today and she's going to stay there until Sunday Morning. I was on a time crunch & still getting ready for work. I reluctantly agreed and took her to work before I had to get ready. She asked to grab a coffee and offered to buy me breakfast so I wouldn't be so crunched for time. I kept looking at the time and got more and more peeved that my time to get ready was slipping away for a coffee & a 15 minute drive bc of her car. I got her there, but on the way, I mentioned the dinner. She mentioned my hair after being quiet most of the ride and I mentioned that I was going to get it cut as a surprise for a surprise date to the restaurant. She groaned and said she's rather go for a date. I said it's a little late for that, and dropped her off with a quick \"I love you\" from her & she grabbed her stuff. I did kinda snap at her and I know that's why she was quiet. \n\nNow she messaged me and said that she loved me & that she's sorry for making me late, which I was. She also mentioned that she would have loved to go to dinner if she could get out of watching her friends kids overnight this weekend. \n\nI know she's probably feeling guilty for making me drive her (she has literally no other choice). I did make a comment that I'd make her just use a motorized pedal bike to bike the 15 minutes up hill. \n\n\nSo I'm asking you all. AITA for mentioning the surprise dinner?", "created_utc": 1692980800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1613y71/aita_for_telling_my_wife_about_a_surprise_date/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was aware of the imposition being put on you, and how frustrated you were, and she tried to reach out by saying that she would have rather had the dinner than deal with the car and the work.

Sounds like it was yours.... because she was ready to go and you hadn't gotten ready yet \n\nWere you purposely not getting ready to stress her out over whether or not you'd give her a ride? \n\nYou honestly sounds like a dick at every point of this interaction.", "I\u2019m not sure if you are an asshole but I do question why you mentioned it all if your intention wasn\u2019t to make her feel bad?  If that was the intention than you would be but its possible with context its more innocent than it seems", "YTA.

You  \"reluctantly agreed\" to drive her to work for a one off situation.  You then brought up the dinner for some reason after she got called in to work this weekend.  Then we she expressed she'd rather be going on that date night with you, you were rude back to her.

At the end of the day, you\u2019re upset she was called into work and ruined your surprise date plans. Then you pile more frustration on by the \u201cinconvenience\u201d of her car breaking down and needing to help her. So you lash out to make her feel upset, just like you are. \n\nNext time, say something like, \u201cHoney, don\u2019t make plans for this day/weekend.

You were petty and passive aggressive and you didn't bring up your feelings like an adult. BUT: if it's regularly difficult to get time with your wife when she works on-call and she's taking additional, unnecessary responsibilities like childcare for friends on top of that, then I would also get frustrated enough to be petty. It's human, but you were T A about how you handled it and I think you know that. This sub will probably rip you apart for daring to experience negative emotions that aren't 100% in the right, but I get it.   \n\n\nYour wife sucks because it seems like she's not making time for you, and because she also seems to be the kind of person who thinks about things that aren't critical as critical. No, she doesn't *have to* watch her friends kids. She just doesn't. The friend can get a babysitter, the friend can call family, this is not something she is being forced to do and she needs to be realistic about that. You should be prioritized too- with the caveat that you didn't even give her the chance TO prioritize you. The date was a surprise. How could she know?   \n\n\nMy guy, you know your wife's schedule is unpredictable. You may like surprises, she may like surprises, they're romantic and fun, but if there's no room in your life for that at this point in time, then there's just no room. She didn't even know that you'd planned anything and you're punishing her for not planning for it too? Make date plans in advance so that you can work together to keep the time free, at least until she's not on-call anymore.", "NAH\n\nCommunicate better with your wife in the future though.", "NTA\n\nShe made you late, made weekend plans without talking to you.

I can understand why OP would be frustrated, and anyone in that situation would be\u2026 we are humans, we will get disappointed. Also, I think stopping for coffee was a l little out of line from the wife when she knew OP had to get to work. That would have 100% peeved me off (I hate being late). I don\u2019t think it is that big of a deal, and married couples should be able to say what bothers them. They aren\u2019t children, they can talk to their significant other about things that bother them (even if it sometimes comes off as rude or annoyed). ALL of us are guilty of that in one way or another.\n\nI am already prepared to be downvoted, but I just don\u2019t get why it\u2019s YTA.

For not recognizing that she would need a ride, for bringing up the date in a passive aggressive way, KNOWING IT WOULD MAKE HER UPSET, and for being snappy at her over things she had no control over! Of course she feels guilty; you basically punished her for her car breaking down suddenly and having to work! \n\nApologize and bring your wife flowers while she watches those kids because it\u2019s the least she deserves after having to deal with the stress of a broken down car, three kids, and your passive aggressive behavior.", "Yeah, almost sounds like he would have done nothing until he heard from his wife that she had to work the.

Also not sure why she needs to babysit for the friend. Is this a favor or an actual job like a nanny to someone she happens to know. I also think it\u2019s weird that he was so annoyed by being late, even when wife was actively apologetic and trying to make it up to him, that he told her about a surprise that won\u2019t happen to make her feel bad? I do not understand this dynamic so I think he\u2019s the AH", "I married her, so yes?", "Wild assumption to blame someone for a car breaking down."]}
