So you went nc with the whole family including this 5 year old\u2014because he was the golden child. And when this golden child was 18, he had a baby and was nervous he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her out the system. So he found you (while he was 18 and you were 31) and you adopted said baby. \n\nAnd this 18 year old stayed with his then girlfriend for the next 16 years and at 34 finally met his daughter where you guys randomly bump into each other at the mall. \n\nLet\u2019s say I believed this story (I really do not)\u2014I would agree YTA. You have poisoned her on them. Your half brother would\u2019ve been 18, a bit of a child himself who really wanted an open adoption so he could probably know his daughter as she grew up. Did you tell her that? Or just that they wanted to get rid of her? Not even including that you considered a 5 year old the gold child.", "Eeehhh. YTA. I just wonder what on earth your half brother could have done to have you hate him since he was a small child and are still holding onto that hate, despite raising his biological child. Why do you hold some much blame on a child? Why don't you place the \"hate\" to your parents, who would be the ones who treated your half-brother as the golden child. You know your daughter wouldn't exist without your half-brother, it's hard to believe that that didn't even eroded the \"hate\" to you have against him even a bit. It's strange that you perpetuated this attitude in your daughter -- they *are* her biological parents. It doesn't mean they raised her, but they did make the choice to know that they couldn't raise her well at that point in their life, and called you for help. They worried about her. They wanted to be a part of her life in an open adoption. It is wrong to act like they hadn't wanted her at all. \n\nIt just sounds like you fostered this hate against her biological parents for things that happened in your family when your half-brother was a small child and you too were a child, and it's weird that now that you have a child, and you don't see the innocence.", "You left home when your brother was 5 and call him the \u201cgolden child\u201d and say you hate him. We\u2019re going to need some more info for what he possibly could have done to you as a little boy.   \nIt makes no sense that of all people, he turned to an estranged brother who he is hated by to turn over his child to. No sense at all. How would he even find you?   \nThis story is hate bait BS", "YTA\n\nIt is fine that you wanted to refer to them as donors between the both of you, but it is just rude to refer to someone like that to their face.  Bio parents is literally what they are. \n\nI am inclined to agree this is either rage bait or you are just immature if you really had that big of a problem with a 5 yr old.", "YTA. Your imaginary half brother was 5 when you went NC.", "YTA - It\u2019s very clear that you poisoned this child against them. Even if you didnt, it was disrespectful to refer to them as her egg and sperm donor. It was meant to be an insult\u2026and you know it. Otherwise, you would have used their names.", "YTA. We\u2019re using an *actual* sperm donor and are going to be a hell of a lot more respectful to them about it than you were to your brother, who, doing the math, was a five year old child when you decided you hated him.", "BS \u2013 YTA", "YTA", "YTA,\n\n'\"bio parents\" is wrong since they are not her parents'  -That's the right name for someone who isn't a parent but gave birth to you. Not explaining that to her is *and* choosing egg and sperm donor, not the first expressions a 16 teenage would go to when talking with a parent -  indeed you are poisening them against her.", "NTA she was the one who was uncomfortable calling them parents and you were respecting her. Brother's reaction makes sense, but it's also not uncommon to call people sperm and egg donors in this case.", "NTA-Your daughter is the one who gets to decide what the people who gave her, her DNA are. To her they aren\u2019t parents. \n\nI had a mum. I have a dad. I also had a sperm donor. The sperm donor gave me half my DNA and a host of other things but he was never my dad. My dad is the one who actually raised me and acted like a parent from the time I was ten years old.  My sperm donor wasn\u2019t happy the first time he heard me call him that but it wasn\u2019t his choice. He chose not to be a parent to me. I chose the rest, just like your daughter.", "I mean, you could have just said they\u2019re the people who gave birth to you, or gave me the opportunity to have you in my life, etc. It sounds a little less rude than sperm and egg donor.\nYou are NTA but I think it could have been handled better on your end what you call them to their faces.\n\nWhat you both call them any other time whatever.", "NTA - I think the donors are ignoring that when they chose to give up a child for adoption that they were \"giving up\". It seems like these are two people who wanted to have only the fun parts of parenting but wanted someone else to deal with the financial components and all of the other hard parts of being a parent. Your daughter sees no need to connect with her progenitors because he sees the people who raised her as her parents. She also already has a biological connection due to the family history. \n\nIf the terms are an issue, well, I think \"sperm donor\" seems perfect for someone who had fun but isn't dealing with the consequences; I find \"egg donor\" to be a little disrespectful since this woman did also carry and deliver your daughter, maybe \"surrogate\" would be a better term. But, honestly, your daughter can call them whatever the hell she wants.", "NTA. But it could have been handled better by not using the nicknames your daughter has for her Bio family, to their faces.", "Were they drug addicts or otherwise dangerous people?", "YTA\n\nYour brother was 5 when you went nc and decided you hated him. I imagine that when he was born, not everything was about you anymore, and you didn't like that. Sounding pretty narcissistic.", "NTA - but you have no relationship with them and shouldn\u2019t care about them being offended.", "NAH. Your past with your brother doesn't matter. Since you didn't explain it was her choice to call them that, I'm somewhat understand to why they were irritated. You knew how they were going to react so you wanted the decades-long one-up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I went nc with my family as soon as I turned 18 and this includes my brother. We never talked until 16 years ago when he called me begging me to adopt his child because they are worried she'll end up in the system.\n\nI agreed to see them and the baby girl was so beautiful. I loved her since the first moment I saw her. I agreed to adopt her. They desparately wanted an open adoption but I wanted a closed adoption. We finally agreed that they can only meet her if she wants to meet them.\n\nI raised my daughter for the past 16 years and I told her she was adopted and I told her about her bio parents. She didn't want to meet them. Once she told me that she feels like calling them \"bio parents\" is wrong since they are not her parents and we agreed to call them sperm and egg donor.\n\nA few days ago we ran into them in a mall. It was the first time they met and my daughter didn't know them. She asked me who they are and I told her they are her sperm and egg donor. My brother got mad at me and called me an asshole for refering to them as that and accused me of poisoning her mind against them\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

His only interactions were those adoption meetings.  He knew nothing of their lives before or after the adoption and hadn't seen his brother since he was 5.\n\nAll he has is this pent up rage/anger towards his parents that he deflected onto a 5 year old and allowed that to form his idea of who his brother is. That's the only narrative he had, a 20 year grudge against a preschooler... YTA, get therapy."]}
