As he was putting his phone down and turning it off, our sister noticed his wallpaper which was a silly picture of SIL drowning in my brother\u2019s clothes. \n\nI awwwwwed immediately and teased him a little but our sister went \u201cshe looks horrible omg\u201d \n\nI said no she looks cute because she really did. She was also posing in a way that made it pretty hard to see her face so sister was definitely just being weird. \n\nSister replied: \u201cnah she looks pretty terrible...

My sister called me some time later and said she wanted me to apologize for making fun of her and promise to always take her side from now on but I said no what she said was out of pocket and mean.
