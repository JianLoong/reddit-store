It's not legally required, but it's morally right.", "NTA - he was well aware that you were still the beneficiary before he passed.  Maybe he still had a soft spot in his heart for you.  If it makes you feel better, split it 50/50.  Either way, NTA and I'm sorry for the loss.  Best of luck, OP.", "NTA - You can do what you wish with the money you were left. Maybe set up a trust for the girl so that she can have more as time goes? That way you can grow the money you were given?", "NTA but it seems like if you are posting here you do think you owe her something. Give some thought to your personal ethics and morals and come up with an answer that\u2019ll let you sleep at night. Maybe just keep a nice nest egg of it to leave to her or her kids in your will that way if you don\u2019t end up needing it she will still benefit it but if you end up in financial straits he left it to you sooooo", "NTA. My ex has me listed as primary. I am the mother of 3 of his kids. They are all adults now but I\u2019m still listed as primary. He knows it. As long as they knew it. Then it\u2019s fine.", "NTA in terms of the will itself...  ex made his choices.  The real issue is whether you want to be close with the stepdaughter.  If you keep 70% of the estate, stepdaughter is likely going to be furious.", "NTA . you will need that money to take care of your daughter the comming years", "Info: how old is his daughter? \n\nAlso, I totally read this as \u201cwibta is I kept my inheritance *away* from my ex husband, and then you said in the first sentence that he died.

In his case, he simply neglected to change it. He knew about it, meant to file the paperwork, then died unexpectedly. The ex wife, not the new wife, got the life insurance as a result.\n\nIn this case, the money should go to whoever is responsible for his death expenses. If that's the daughter, then her. Otherwise if he has a new spouse, it should be her. If, for whatever reason, there are no such expenses, it should go to the daughter.\n\nETA: I'm assuming based on your word choice that the daughter is full grown and you are not caring for her. If you were, obviously it would be acceptable for you to keep the whole thing.", "NTA IF you split it the way it was listed.\n\nYTA if you keep it all.\n\nIf you share more, then more power to you.  But minimum, keep it split 70/30 as it was set up.\n\nI kept my ex's daughter as a beneficiary on mine until she turned 18 - so she would be taken care of as the ex was terrible with money.  Since I am not married anymore my nieces are (55/45 %).  I expect them to honor that split unless the older wants to evenly split.  Which I believe she would.", "NTA based on the first Edit. He knew you were listed as the primary beneficiary. Plus, if it's anything like my old work insurance, it reminds me each year to check my beneficiary. Personally since he had to do something with it this year, I am guessing he was fine with you being the beneficiary. We'll never know know but if he didn't change it, and knew you were on it, and never mentioned updating it then yeah I think he did want you to have a portion of it. \n\nI don't know what all went in to your divorce but you can still want the best for your ex even if they aren't your person.", "How long were you married? Who is paying end of life expenses?\n\nInsurance should be used first to pay the funeral expenses. Then I believe it is up to you how you want to share your portion of the reminder. If you were married for 10 years or more then I think you would be justified in keeping your portion. If you were married 5 years or less then giving more to his daughter would be a nice gesture. \n\nDo you need the money for yourself? Does the daughter need it more? You can do what makes the most financial sense for you.", "NTA.  The money is absolutely yours.  Keep it.  That's how these things work.  He could have simply changed the beneficiary at the time of divorce if he didn't want you to have it.  No one gets divorced and doesn't get told to check these things. It's your money.", "Talk to the life insurance company and ask what is the process of you want them to send her a larger check.\n\nThat way you know the process and you can think about it.", "Nta i guess but youre kind of shitty for taking it", "YWBTA\n\nHe meant to leave it to his daughter. You should give ALL of it to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's more, you know this.", "NTA. But you should make sure the stepdaughter is in your will.", "NAH; But also make the point of keeping ties with her and maybe splitting it evenly or flipping the ratio.\n\nMore importantly ask your stepdaughter how she is doing.  Make sure she knows she still has you.", "YTA. Give it to his daughter. This should be obvious.", "YWBTA, while legally right, its morally wrong, and I think you know it, which is why youre asking here. Id bet anything he just never filled the paperwork out, or he switched one beneficiary and thought it covered everything.", "YTA. \n\nLook, you've been divorced 2 years.  Give that money to his actual family.   Are you contributing at all to the funeral?  Or do you just expect to get free money?", "INFO: What kind of relationship do you have with your stepdaughter?", "You are his EX for a reason; my guess would be that he was procrastinating changing the documents - I am guilty of that myself. Most of us don't know when we are going to die. The inheritance should go to his daughter.  She is his daughter - you are his ex. Legally it may be yours,  but the fact that you are asking, shows that you already know what is morally the right thing to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most people would assume that inheritance goes from parent to child and/or surviving spouse, so if deviating from that hurts someone you care about, kinda the A H.\n\nBut all other things aside, NTA since it's generally okay to follow the wishes of the deceased.", "There you go.
