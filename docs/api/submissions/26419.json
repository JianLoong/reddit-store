I'm not going to judge because grief is an unruly beast. But I will implore you to think of your dad as much as you can right now. \n\nYou are angry at your sister on behalf of your mom. I understand. You saw the pain your sister's absence caused your mom. You were powerless to stop that suffering. Your sister showed disregard for your mom's condition. She didn't appreciate how little time your mom had left. She indulged in her own life while her mom longed to see her. I totally get it. \n\nBut, if your parents were still married, your dad lost his partner. He is grieving, too. Add in conflict between his children and the stress must be unbearable. He needs you to be strong for him like you were for your mom. You can do it. Love your dad more than you want to punish your sister right now. Then hash it out with her in private. \n\nI'm so sorry. You are a good son. Your grief matters too. I wish there was a quick fix for the devastation of grief and loss. I wholehearted hope for peace for you. My most sincere condolences.", "NTA, you are grieving and your feelings are valid. Is it your father's house ? In this case, you should respect his decision and ignore her.", "Oh my heart hurts for you.  \n\nMy grandmother lived with me in the late years of her life. When she passed, I tried to get in touch with my sister. Who had not seen her in years. I finally had to call the law enforcement agency in the city that she lived in and had them go to her home and deliver a message for her to call me.\n\nShe did not come to the funeral. \n\nI do not think I\u2019ve ever really forgiven her. I know that my grandmother missed her for years. \n\nI do not think you are an asshole. You are a son who lost his mother and who watched her miss her daughter during the hardest time of her life. \n\nThe only advice I can give you is to be gentle with yourself. Sending you Internet hugs.", "NTA, but you need to completely drop it in the meantime. Your father just lost his wife, the added stress of you two fighting could very well be too much for him to handle. \n\nOnce she leaves again, then you can definitely go no contact with her (she sucks, I\u2019d hate her too).

NTA!!", "NTA - Your rest of your family is including the sister.

U dnt get to tell her to leave the house tho if it\u2019s ur dads.

There was no physical way to make that funeral, for any amount of dollars.", "It seems to me that the fact that your sister missed the funeral and did not get to say goodbye to your mom is already a big consequence, we don't know what is going through your sister's mind but I would bet she is feeling awful about not being there more often. Do you really need to punish her more than she is already punishing herself? Seems like you are blaming her for causing pain to your mother but I bet that if she had been there even for a few minutes your mom would have hugged her and \"forgiven\" her in a heartbeat, so why do you have to be your mom's avenger?\n\nIt is obvious that you resent your sister for traveling the world and choosing what to do with her life. Would you feel the same way if your mom was alive? would you still be upset at her if your mom was completely healthy but sad because she misses her daughter? \n\nSoft YTA because I understand you are grieving, sorry for your loss.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but both of your sisters and your father also lost a loved one and you are creating conflict that is not going to change the past. \n\nLook, I really hate this \u201cinfluencer\u201d culture, but if your sister built it into something where she was independently housing, feeding, and clothing herself, it was her job. \n\nWould you be as angry that she couldn\u2019t get from a desk job in Indonesia to wherever you live in less than 24 hours time? \n\nHave you ever considered that it may have been too much for your sister to visit in person when you even say your mom just cries every time your sister calls and visits? Cancer is awful, and not every family member can handle seeing their loved one decline, and in this case your mom was in decline, and also opposed your sister traveling and opposed her leaving the country, and also cried every time sister phoned or visited. \n\nI hope you can stop your anger and fight with your sister and salvage the time all of you are with your father, who has asked that you stop this argument.", "YTA.\n\nHow is she supposed to get back from Indonesia in less than 24 hours?\n\nAnd judging other people\u2019s handling of grief is AH behavior.", "ESH \n\nYou knew she was in another country so why could the funeral not be postponed a day or two to allow her time to travel ?", "YTA\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you resent the fact that your mother apparently preferred her and fixated on her.\n\n>\"You couldn't even make it to the funeral.\"\n\nThis makes you doubly an AH for scheduling the funeral the next fucking day.

I'm not saying you can't have different people with different personalities in a family, but if one person says \"family is worth fighting for\" and the other says \"family is only good for what you can get out of them\" than what value is the connection? Your sister shows up fucking **late.** \n\nYea, she was in indonesia, but I place good odds your mothers passing wasn't completely random, this kind of thing becomes pretty obvious to hospice caregivers and other people in the business of palliative care, and family is frequently told to expect a loss in days or weeks. Your sister probably had a headsup and chose being in indonesia for \"the gram\" over family. She isn't worth your time if you weren't worth hers.", "Going to go with YTA here, although I can see where your emotions are coming from. You have recently lost your mother, who you were extremely close to. Not only that, but in your eyes, you had to watch her decline physically. From your perspective, your sister was a self-centered person who was more interested in being an influencer than being there for your mom.\n\nHowever, you may want to consider that your sister may have had a much more complex and/or strained relationship with your mother than you did. I see people in the comments speculating on whether or not your sister is inconsiderate or your mother was manipulative. To me, it is hard for us on reddit to accurately judge a family conflict from such little information (from a third party at that). What is most relevant is that your mother and sister seemed to have had a disagreement regarding your sister's desire to travel, and it was never really resolved before your mother's death. Another thing to consider is that your sister did actually meet your mother in person, so maybe she did have commitments that kept her from seeing your mother more frequently. Is travelling perhaps a job requirement she couldn't get out of? If not then I'm not sure how she can pay for so many trips.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that your sister was not as close to your mother as you were, and that this probably impacted how she reveived information about your mother's health. While you likely had a more accurate view of how fast your mother was declining, she may not have understood how serious her condition was until she had already passed. And as other people had said, it would have been physically impossible for her to get to the funeral from Indonesia within one day.\n\nRegardless of the circumstances of your mother and sister's relationship, you are allowed to feel hurt. But your father is right in that now is not the time to stew in your anger to your sister. Manage the grief of your mother's passing before you try and untangle with your feelings towards your sister, or you may make an already difficult time harder for your family and yourself.", "this is heartbreaking on more than one level. sorry for your loss. but i dont think being mad at your sister is a priority right now. NAH", "First, it's \"she never visits.\" Then it's \"she only stayed for a week.\" \n\nThere was nothing she could have done to make you happy short of moving back, and that wouldn't have been fair to her. Time isn't promised to anyone, and her income depends on travel. You need to check yourself.", "YTA.  You cannot fully understand a relationship between your sister and your mother.  A woman left on a world wide adventure.  Her mother wanted her to simply not go.  Would cry in the phone and have whatever painful and likely manipulative conversation every time she called.  Your sister had her own ideas of grieving and nothing you say on Reddit will make her be what you or your mother wanted.  The rushed funeral was the reason she wasn\u2019t there -  your parents knew where she was and CHOSE to have it when they did.  May your sister cut ties with you. And hold onto the love and acceptance where it exists. Enough bad mouthing her.", "NTA \n\nShe showed where her priorities lie and that is nowhere near the family. I would suggest that distance yourself from her and let everyone else do what they want. \n\nIf people keep pressuring you to forgive her then maybe ask them whether are you forcing them to see your sister\u2019s fault in this? \n\nAsk them to keep the behaviour and opinions to themselves and not force anything on you. \n\nI am really sorry for your loss and hope you have enough support to get through this grief! \u2665\ufe0f", "NTA. \n\nI know there are going to be a lot of comments on here that are probably going to rhapsodize about how it's likely that she's fully justified and you're the one with the problem, blah blah, but idk. Call me old fashioned but there are times when you put stuff like that aside and when someone is terminal and their funeral are up high on that list. \n\nThat being said, please extend your father and other siblings some grace. They're grieving just the same way that you are. Be civil to your sister (if you can't, just don't talk to her) and decide later what you want to do with the relationship. Take it easy as losing a parent is incredibly difficult.", "NTA. Your grief for your mother and your resentment of your sister are feeding off one another right now, though. Keep your distance from her and grieve. I really hope she has the sense not to use your mother\u2019s death in her online postings.", "YTA and your mother is as well, your sister is an adult ... she should be able to have a live.. she is not your mothers property or her doll... against your mothers wishes? wtf did that women think she was to have a say in someone elses life.. and then she cried every time she called to guild trip her back... wtf!", "No judgement.  I've lost my mother and my best friend in the last three years. Anger is a part of grief. You get this red hot anger and focus it on someone. What ends up happening is you let it go.  You are super angry with your sister, but most likely she is going to have the weight of this with her the rest of her life. And if she doesn't, You will realize that she wasn't worth a thought. Both times this happened for me. Once with a sister and once with a friend. My sister I just couldn't understand or handle her actions when our mother died. And I stopped speaking to her. I immediately felt lighter and have had no regrets. I wish her well and I understand her actions were mistakes she made. It is what it is. The anger is gone but i still have no desire to talk to her. I think you are in your anger period. It's OK if you don't talk to your sister again. It's OK if you are angry. Honestly the angry helps with grief because you fixate on it while you are dealing with an incredible loss. Feel all of your feelings and don't worry about anyone else's perception of you. And if you need to talk, feel free to dm me.", "YTA, because what I've gotten is that you're a 26 year old dude still living at your parent's house.   \nEven if I'm wrong, and you do not live there, that isn't *your* house. That's your dad's house, and your dad has final say on who gets to stay in his house. If you don't like your sister there, leave. Go back to your place or get a hotel. Either way,  you're making your mother's funeral about *your* feelings. Look. You don't have to like that your sister is there. You can avoid her presence. What you should not be doing is intruding on other family member's grief because you have a wild hair across your ass.", "NTA, you have every right to hate her, and she should never be trusted nor you help her in the future in any way shape or form. \n\nHowever your dad need all of you right now, deep down he is happy that you spoke what everyone was thinking silently. Sorry for you lose.", "NTA First of all I'm so sorry for your loss. I understand that your father doesn't need a fight between his children right now you should respect that, but there is a fine line between don't fight with your sister and forgive her for the fact that she wasn't here. \n\nThis isn't about the funeral i mean even if your sister were there on time it means nothing, she should have been present when your mother was alive.", "NTA", "Nta", "My heart hurts for all you. Try to find forgiveness and talk your sister about her relationship with your mother. Let her know how hard it has been for all of you having to deal with your mother. It does sound quite intense having a parent lament your life choices every time you speak to them. All of this situation hurts everyone. Try to find peace where you can, build bridges and find healing where you can. Talk and tell stories of your mum, what she liked, her dreams and achievements. Sending peace and light in these dark times.", "NTA. You don't have to forgive someone just because they are blood. Family doesn't start or end with blood. Family starts and ends with caring and being there for each other. Your sister showed how little she cared. It's easy to say she made a mistake. She can't be proven wrong as your mum is already dead. So she doesn't have a second chance to prove she would do it differently. She didn't care about your mum. You don't have to care about her. It's entirely your decision. Sadly your family will blame you for the bad blood. It seems they are on your sister's side. So be prepared for altered relationships with your family members as well.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to grieve and have your feelings. Maybe you will forgive her, one day, but that day is not today.", "Not that you should, but generally people have to ask for forgivenes to give it", "This, be kind Op, it's what your mother would want, and if you can't manage it separating yourself from her and any conflicts is what's best for everyone. \n\nIt's not very comforting, but one day your sister will realize what she missed out on, and she'll kick herself and be guilty for the rest of her life. Where the comfort comes in is for you, you were there, till the bitter end and then some. You will never know the regret she will, so just grieve now knowing each day it gets easier. For her, it will only get worse.", "Did I miss where OP says they are in the US? I assumed they were not, given they used the word \"Mum\" and not \"Mom\". It could have been a much shorter trip than you're imagining, with more frequent flights.", "Chances are they may have known it was close to the end unless it was a very rapid decline. So we don't know for sure whether or not she could have made the funeral or not, which may factor into OP's anger.", "Nah, most of what you say is totally fair, but OP is also grieving and understandably angry. So NAH", "I mean, her mother was dying. Chances are that it's possible that she *could* have visited more often if it was a priority and chose not to.", "Seems kind of unfair to pick on the fact that he was staying with his mother? He was likely staying with her because of the cancer and he wanted to give her assistance.", "I had my own flat. When cancer got worse, I moved back to live with them. I'll probably move out again after a while", "OP is welcome to explain the rush, the inability to hold a funeral for the daughter she pined for, and what exactly was explained to her at the time.  And sister is very welcome to grieve and visit as she feels is right.  She is not a pawn.  She literally left the continent to get some space.  There may be a valid reason.", "I get that he's grieving but his hatred for his sister is very clear.  His mother had an unhealthy attachment to her daughter.", "OP is the AH by causing inconvenience to others who are also grieving. If the house belongs to his father OP doesn't even have any right to ask her to leave. Without knowing the financial situation of OPs sister, she can't be blamed for not travelling before. It seems like she was in contact with OPs mum throughout.", "Who did schedule the funeral?  How were you guys even able to get a funeral in that short a time frame?", "I wonder if having brothers funeral in a rushed manner ruffled any feathers\u2026", "Not really. His father is there. His younger sister is there.   \nI'm hoping he works, so that he's not a burden on an already stressed family.   \nHe can have an apartment and still visit his mother on a daily basis.   \nLet's face it, the one mom wanted most was the one that wasn't there on a daily basis.", "OP didn't schedule the funeral, and states that their mother believed that the funeral should be held right away. Some customs are like that. \n\nThere's also no indication that OP thinks of his sister as a pawn so that's a weird accusation.", "I guess that's true that others are there. Then again there is no limit on how many people can provide emotional support, and he seems to have a strong connection with his mother (given that he made his post). Maybe it gave him more peace of mind to stay with her. Although I would sure hope he didn't quit his job just to do so.\n\nI do agree with you on most of what you said, it was just that one point that confused me.", "Come here.  Stay. Do not travel. One week isn\u2019t enough.  Listen to me cry and moan about you leaving. Honestly- his mother sounds like his sister had good reason to stay away.  OP has every right and ability to now include sister in a full family gathering to mourn. And see what the choice is? Pitch a fit and remind her why she stays away. Not a celebration of life, just a guilt and bitch festivity, extra guilt."]}
