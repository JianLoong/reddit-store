I'm not going to judge because grief is an unruly beast. But I will implore you to think of your dad as much as you can right now. \n\nYou are angry at your sister on behalf of your mom. I understand. You saw the pain your sister's absence caused your mom. You were powerless to stop that suffering. Your sister showed disregard for your mom's condition. She didn't appreciate how little time your mom had left. She indulged in her own life while her mom longed to see her. I totally get it. \n\nBut, if your parents were still married, your dad lost his partner. He is grieving, too. Add in conflict between his children and the stress must be unbearable. He needs you to be strong for him like you were for your mom. You can do it. Love your dad more than you want to punish your sister right now. Then hash it out with her in private. \n\nI'm so sorry. You are a good son. Your grief matters too. I wish there was a quick fix for the devastation of grief and loss. I wholehearted hope for peace for you. My most sincere condolences.", "NTA, you are grieving and your feelings are valid. Is it your father's house ? In this case, you should respect his decision and ignore her.", "Oh my heart hurts for you.  \n\nMy grandmother lived with me in the late years of her life. When she passed, I tried to get in touch with my sister. Who had not seen her in years. I finally had to call the law enforcement agency in the city that she lived in and had them go to her home and deliver a message for her to call me.\n\nShe did not come to the funeral. \n\nI do not think I\u2019ve ever really forgiven her. I know that my grandmother missed her for years. \n\nI do not think you are an asshole. You are a son who lost his mother and who watched her miss her daughter during the hardest time of her life. \n\nThe only advice I can give you is to be gentle with yourself. Sending you Internet hugs.", "NTA, but you need to completely drop it in the meantime. Your father just lost his wife, the added stress of you two fighting could very well be too much for him to handle. \n\nOnce she leaves again, then you can definitely go no contact with her (she sucks, I\u2019d hate her too). But for the sake of the family, suck it up for now. Hate her in private until everyone has begun to recover from the immense grief.", "NTA! NTA!!", "NTA - Your rest of your family is including the sister.  Go NC with sister, she has already made it crystal clear that for her, family is nothing, her InstaGram is everything (you should point that out to the others when they talk about family needing to be together in trying times).", "NTA but at this point cut ties for ur self and let others decide for themselves. U dnt get to tell her to leave the house tho if it\u2019s ur dads. I hate when ppl say oh it was a mistake like how is it a mistake that she knew ur mom was at the end of her life and made no plans to get back ? weak excuses.", "Broski Indonesia to US is a 2 day trip, just the flight time is over 24h. There\u2019s only a few departures a day, only 1 for some routes. There was no physical way to make that funeral, for any amount of dollars.", "It seems to me that the fact that your sister missed the funeral and did not get to say goodbye to your mom is already a big consequence, we don't know what is going through your sister's mind but I would bet she is feeling awful about not being there more often. Do you really need to punish her more than she is already punishing herself? Seems like you are blaming her for causing pain to your mother but I bet that if she had been there even for a few minutes your mom would have hugged her and \"forgiven\" her in a heartbeat, so why do you have to be your mom's avenger?\n\nIt is obvious that you resent your sister for traveling the world and choosing what to do with her life. Would you feel the same way if your mom was alive? would you still be upset at her if your mom was completely healthy but sad because she misses her daughter? \n\nSoft YTA because I understand you are grieving, sorry for your loss.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but both of your sisters and your father also lost a loved one and you are creating conflict that is not going to change the past. \n\nLook, I really hate this \u201cinfluencer\u201d culture, but if your sister built it into something where she was independently housing, feeding, and clothing herself, it was her job. \n\nWould you be as angry that she couldn\u2019t get from a desk job in Indonesia to wherever you live in less than 24 hours time? \n\nHave you ever considered that it may have been too much for your sister to visit in person when you even say your mom just cries every time your sister calls and visits? Cancer is awful, and not every family member can handle seeing their loved one decline, and in this case your mom was in decline, and also opposed your sister traveling and opposed her leaving the country, and also cried every time sister phoned or visited. \n\nI hope you can stop your anger and fight with your sister and salvage the time all of you are with your father, who has asked that you stop this argument.", "YTA.\n\nHow is she supposed to get back from Indonesia in less than 24 hours?\n\nAnd judging other people\u2019s handling of grief is AH behavior.", "ESH \n\nYou knew she was in another country so why could the funeral not be postponed a day or two to allow her time to travel ?", "YTA\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you resent the fact that your mother apparently preferred her and fixated on her.\n\n>\"You couldn't even make it to the funeral.\"\n\nThis makes you doubly an AH for scheduling the funeral the next fucking day. What was the rush? You deliberately set it up so she couldn't possibly be there so that you could shame her for it after she rushed home. \n\nYou should be ashamed.", "YTA. It's your father's home, so it's your father's choice and not yours.\n\nYou also aren't privy to what may have happened to your mother/sister relationship when your mother tried to stop her from traveling.", "\"Did not want her to travel the world.\"  \"Left the country against her wishes.\"   <--there's the reason and the answer.  But you already know that.  Just how badly did your mother struggle and try to hold your sister back?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
