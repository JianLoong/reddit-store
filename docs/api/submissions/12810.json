You could even leave all the details of where she'd like to go up to her so that you don't have to worry about planning, as you mention suffering from burnout.\n\nIt may also help if you plan on a daddy daughter night.

Staying home with a newborn as a first time mother with your in laws is incredibly mentally taxing. She\u2019s not only been thrown into this brand new life altering thing but it\u2019s 24/7. Even when someone else has the baby I can guarantee she\u2019s thinking about when the baby has to eat next, has the baby had enough to eat, has she wet enough diapers, did that last round of bottle get sterilized for long enough, etc. imagine caring for a newborn all day as being in surgery for 24 hours straight. By all means, spend as much time as you possibly can with your newborn. The days are long but the months are extremely extremely short.

The night out isn't about you, it's about what she needs after months of dealing with a baby that she grew inside her body and pushed out all by herself \\[not as 'physically demanding'? Okay sure Jan\\]. Yeah you have an infant child, and yeah you want to spend time with her, but you can't do that at the expense of the woman who birthed her unless you want to lose her.", "YTA. Not for wanting to spend time at home, but for discounting your wife\u2019s energy and desires by reasoning that because what you\u2019re doing is more difficult, what you want matters more.

She is essentially raising your child as a single parent if you are working 80 hours a week. It is not unreasonable at all for her to want to have a romantic evening with her husband because she probably feels lonely and unloved with you being gone all of the time.

Indeed you have a very demanding and exhausting job and it must suck to not be able to spend more time with your newborn. BUT you\u2019re not doing your marriage any favors. Your wife already sees little of you, plus being a new mom can be extremely emotionally draining (your in laws might help with the physical stuff but can\u2019t help there, in fact, might make things worse). Many relationships suffer when a child comes because parents forget to nurture themselves as a couple too, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now.

What will she do then? \n\nI know she's probably grieving her previous life and wanting to do something \"normal\" but she needs to read the room a bit better.

She also might be struggling if they are the type of people who are \"brutally honest\" and our criticizing some of her choices, her post baby body, her family, etc. She may have been asking to go out with you because she wanted somewhere she was able to talk to you where she wasn't going to feel like she was being listened to.\n\nConsider this: your wife has no alone time, period. She also has no one-on-one time with you. She is around y'alls baby and your parents 24/7.  Her wanting to go out is likely not just her being burned out, it's her wanting to spend one-on-one time with the man she married, to have a little romance, to feel love between you two. You shut her down and we're dismissive of her work taking care of a baby and her feelings. I know you're busy, I know you miss your kid, but you HAVE to spend time with your wife or you'll end up divorced.", "Doc, with all respect, after reading all your posts I think you are condescending AF.", "Cut by my own sword!", "Yeah I feel bad that he said what he does is a lot harder than what she is going through in one of the replies. Maybe he has fallen out of love with his wife, who knows but I think that kid is going to end up with two single parents pretty soon if he doesn't change his attitude towards her.", "But he just worked 24 hours straight. I don\u2019t think any sane person would want to go out after working 24 hours straight. That\u2019s literally unhealthy and unsafe.", "Yeah I agree about the rest but his point was more about how he'd rather spend the time at home with his infant daughter. Again, that is fine but he also said:\n\n\"Besides, I don't want to compromise a single second with my baby for anything else unless I absolutely have to. I'm not spending nearly as much time with her as I should.\"\n\nThis makes me think that he is not going to make time for his wife in the near future. The best thing to do after rejecting his wifes desire for a dinner date would be to say \"I don't want to today, i'm too tired and want to spend time with our daughter but how about we do it on x day or next week or whatever\"\n\nInstead he says \"I rejected her offer and she has my parents anyway and she's not doing anything anywhere near as demanding as me anyway\" he's nasty about her and what she's doing with her life which is supporting his daughter...", "If he were arguing that he needed sleep instead of going out, I would agree with you.  But that\u2019s not what he\u2019s saying.  He\u2019s saying he wants to spend every waking,non-working moment with his child at the expense of his relationship with his wife.", "Elaborate please", "And yet, he\u2019s wasting his time getting a thumbs-up from Reddit instead of communicating with his wife. I\u2019m not sure this is real; like you said, most surgeons I know don\u2019t have time to waste on an AITA post.", "Agree with that 100%.", "Yep. They will either be in line of sight of baby, or have a babycall with them. Also, please remember we are very safe countries, and this is considered the norm. \n\nAt kindergarden the kids play outside no matter the weather too. It's a good way to live. We are taught from early age \"there is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing\".", "Wow. Here I don't know anyone that doesn't take the stroller out every day to get a walk and fresh air, leave the house, and let baby nap. I have friends who went on daily 2 hour walks just because baby had the best sleep outside with the fresh air and stroller movement.", "I don\u2019t know anyone who does that here. Come on.", "If OP is doing a surgical residency chances are they live in an area with access to indoor shopping centers.", "Yeah but as adults we can\u2019t be completely codependent on our partner for our outings / peace of mind etc.  Op is going through a shit ton of hours.  She can\u2019t wait for them. If she wants a date night she\u2019s got to compromise too", "Surely if it\u2019s a place too cold to walk around during the day there would be indoor shopping centres? I live in a hot climate so have no idea.", "Devalues his wife AND thinks it\u2019s helpful to have your in laws around all the time. Even when you love your in-laws, that can be mentally grueling.", "Dealing with a newborn and in-laws while recovering physically from giving birth\u2026that\u2019s a lot, too. He needs to quit comparing the hard and just realize they both have difficult journeys right now. I\u2019m not saying that means they should go out - the man should sleep - but there\u2019s no need to degrade her hard while trying to get what he wants/needs that night.", "Oh god no. My son was a nightmare baby, colicky, clingy, refused dummies and bottles so he was exclusively breastfed and he seemed to wholeheartedly believe that sleep was for the weak. My sister, who was a paediatric nurse at the time, remarked \"god he's needy isn't he?\" when he was 4 months old.\n\nIn contrast, he may have been the best toddler ever. Well-behaved, good natured, rarely had tantrums, polite, sweet, curious, independent, just a joy to be around. \n\nThe newborn stage was by far the hardest part for me, it very much depends on the child.", "NO.", "It takes a lot of skill to become a surgeon, people who actually make it to residency usually don't just give up because their wife wants to go out more often", ">So, at what point is your wife a priority.\n\nThis is a really important question.  People who haven't been a new mother often don't realize how invisible you suddenly become.  For nine months, everyone is fussing over you and helping you.  And then the baby comes out, and everyone is fussing over the baby, and they don't even really see you as a person who needs things anymore.  The world gets so wrapped up in that baby that they forget to even say hello to the mom.\n\nShe wants adult conversation and activity.  She wants to be treated like a whole person again.  She wants to eat a meal while it's still hot, without holding a baby the whole time.  And OP is the person she loves and turns to for that.", "There are other solutions though; having dinner at home just the two of them while his parents watch the baby in another part of the house; going out for breakfast instead of dinner, etc.  OP sucks bc he\u2019s dismissive of his wife\u2019s needs.  A lot of women, once they have a baby, are often reduced to nothing more than \u201cmom.\u201d  The people around them lose sight that they are full and whole women, with the same interests and needs before they had the baby.  It\u2019s not unreasonable for her to want to spend some time alone with her husband so she can feel like herself again.", "I kind of see what you mean there. Also since he almost never gets to see his infant daughter, I can somehow understand that he probably wants to spend more time with his because those days don't last long. But ye, he probably could've worded it a bit better, that he wants to spend time with both his wife and his daughter, with a bit more priority for the newborn because that's really understandable.", "They haven't lived somewhere hot yet, I handle heat very poorly, you can only undress so much besides tearing off your own skin which it has come to before", "That\u2019s true. But she may have moved somewhere with him for his residency - I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s the case. Because if they moved across the country while she was pregnant so he could get training, she may not have had time to make new friends before becoming home bound with a newborn and in laws. That may change the dynamic and be a reason for the unusual dependency for social interaction. Either way, I agree he needs sleep.", "No. They died off years ago.", "I am going by my own experience with my 3 kids I think it was the easiest\n\nAnd on top of that it's not like a new born can do much they literally just sleep drink milk and \ud83d\udca9 older kid talk back and all that kinda stuff", "And for a 3rd time I am going by my own experience with my 3 daughters how hard is it when babys literally just ate sleep shit I get the sleeps nights can be hard but kids that age also nap in the day so just nap with the kids and with what you said about your baby was only breastfeed so where my 3 daughters so that doesn't make a difference", "I am going by my own experience with my 3 daughters \n\n\nIt's not like they do much they eat sleep and shit I get the little sleep in the night can be hard but it's not like the kid doesn't sleep in the day so you can just sleep in the day when the baby does", "Exactly. And she wants her husband to see her. She might (depending on how baby focussed they are) get some adult conversation from her in laws. But even her partner is treating her as invisible and irrelevant. And talking about how he doesn\u2019t want to miss time with his child. With zero regard for the woman he loves. I\u2019m going to be generous and assume it\u2019s sleep deprivation making him this oblivious but he needs to open his eyes to reality. His wife should not be an afterthought or second best.", "So all this big malls we see in the American tv shows and movies aren\u2019t true\u2026I feel a little betrayed. We still have them in Oz", "They can scream pretty much nonstop, be awake every single hour, and never calm down unless their mother is holding them, and even then only stop sometimes if being breastfed. \n\nMy kid was an extremely easy newborn. Really he was extremely easy until 2 or 3. It\u2019s only gotten harder from there. Other people had newborns like my previous example, and then around a year old they became little angels. Your experience, and mine, is not the same one everyone gets.", "You are not the only mother in existence your experience is not the experience of every mother, stop trying to push your narrative as fact", "You're going by your own experience which is only your own, you don't speak for everyone. And it absolutely does make a difference when your kid is feeding every hour on the hour like clockwork and screams every time they're put down to sleep so you end up holding them while they nap and you're still expected to keep on top of everything else you have to do. You can't always nap when they nap.", "Lol! Sleep doesn\u2019t work like that for everyone, especially when cooking, cleaning and laundry have to happen.", "There are definitely still malls in America. I have no idea what this person is thinking.", "They are everywhere in the US, not sure what that persons on about.", "We have them in England! Even the tiny town I grew up near had three (shit) ones.", "They\u2019re definitely not as popular as they used to be, but they do still exist. I\u2019ve lived in four states, on opposite coasts and in the middle of the US, and have always been within a one hour driving distance of a mall.", "They\u2019ve died off since the 80s.", "Ignore the downvotes brigade. You've just pissed off the stay at home parents who feel the need to defend their insecurities.", "One I know how kids work don't treat me like I am stupid when I said I have 3 daughters and all of you guys need to learn to accept people have different opinions than you and that is ok", "They're a dude. So the newborn stage probably wasn't that hard for him as he wasn't even the one exclusively breastfeeding the kids.", "How about putting in the fact that I am not speaking for everyone else and never was this is a site where people put there own opinions are calm down \n\nBtw I never said I am a mother I got the worng parts for that", "I never said I did speak for everyone I only commented my own opinion and going by your comment I could say the same about you that you don't speak for everyone aswell", "And if you do most of the chores each day they don't actually take long it still doesn't change facts that all a nb does is eat sleeping shit", "Yeah, Mall of America is a big on.\n\nI have 3 near me in Dallas.\n\nThen there are strip malls which also still exist", "Yrs there sre.  Even in the tiny town I live near in Minnesota, there's an indoor mall. There are several all across Minnesota, most notably, of course, Mall of America.", "You say this as if they are an extinct species and not in abundance in many cities in America", "I have about 5 malls surrounding me, only 1 mall outside. The rest are indoor malls.\n\nYou are literally trying to make every excuse that the wife cannot go walking.", "You stated newborns are easy and it only gets harder. Like a fact. It is not a fact. Your opinion is not a fact. And if your opinion is \u201cnewborns are easiest\u201d rather than \u201cmy children were easiest as newborns\u201d, your opinion is very very wrong.", "You made a blanket statement to say the newborn stage is the easiest and have dug down on the statement when multiple people disagreed. I said it depends on the child so I'm not the one speaking for everyone."]}
