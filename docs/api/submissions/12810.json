Knowing in advance gives you time to prepare mentally so it doesn't happen when you're all geared up for a relaxing night at home after work. You can also seek out quieter venues that won't make you feel as stressed. You could even leave all the details of where she'd like to go up to her so that you don't have to worry about planning, as you mention suffering from burnout.\n\nIt may also help if you plan on a daddy daughter night.

Even when someone else has the baby I can guarantee she\u2019s thinking about when the baby has to eat next, has the baby had enough to eat, has she wet enough diapers, did that last round of bottle get sterilized for long enough, etc. imagine caring for a newborn all day as being in surgery for 24 hours straight. By all means, spend as much time as you possibly can with your newborn. The days are long but the months are extremely extremely short.

The night out isn't about you, it's about what she needs after months of dealing with a baby that she grew inside her body and pushed out all by herself \\[not as 'physically demanding'?

Indeed you have a very demanding and exhausting job and it must suck to not be able to spend more time with your newborn. BUT you\u2019re not doing your marriage any favors. Your wife already sees little of you, plus being a new mom can be extremely emotionally draining (your in laws might help with the physical stuff but can\u2019t help there, in fact, might make things worse). Many relationships suffer when a child comes because parents forget to nurture themselves as a couple too, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now.

What will she do then? \n\nI know she's probably grieving her previous life and wanting to do something \"normal\" but she needs to read the room a bit better.

She also has no one-on-one time with you. She is around y'alls baby and your parents 24/7.  Her wanting to go out is likely not just her being burned out, it's her wanting to spend one-on-one time with the man she married, to have a little romance, to feel love between you two.

I'm not spending nearly as much time with her as I should.\"\n\nThis makes me think that he is not going to make time for his wife in the near future. The best thing to do after rejecting his wifes desire for a dinner date would be to say \"I don't want to today, i'm too tired and want to spend time with our daughter but how about we do it on x day or next week or whatever\"\n\nInstead he says \"I rejected her offer and she has my parents anyway and she's not doing anything anywhere near as demanding as me anyway\" he's nasty about her and what she's doing with her life which is supporting his daughter...", "If he were arguing that he needed sleep instead of going out, I would agree with you.

He also said \"she is not doing anything anywhere near as physically or cognitively demanding as what I am doing.\" so clearly he thinks she's lesser than him.", "The post I replied to is not phrased as a question but ok", "Yeah, it should", "Absolutely we should have regulations for doctors. Like, 110%. I don\u2019t want a doctor who has been awake 12 hours doing my complicated surgery. I can not agree with you more. \n\nOP states that there are two other adults helping with child care. I completely understand the dynamic of having your in laws living with you etc. but there is help.  She wants to go out after his 24 hour shift and his solution is to do something at home that let\u2019s him spend time with daughter, wife, AND get some rest. OPs wife is being unreasonable about needing to do something that very night or be unwilling to compromise with the solution OP had come up with.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s not gloss over the fact that you stated truck drivers have to work 24 hour shifts, and when presented with facts showing you are wrong you have now shifted to try blaming lack of regulation and how moms work 24 hours too. Your post was wrong, that\u2019s the bottom line.", "None of what you just wrote changes the fact that you\u2019re talking nonsense. Making wild and easily refutable claims just undermines your credibility.", "You know that OP isn\u2019t the only human being involved here, right?  And that his wife probably has her own version of the story even though OP chooses not to acknowledge it, right?  Frankly, the more dismissive he is of her needs generally, the credible he is on issues like whether his parents are actually a help to his wife when he\u2019s not there, or if having them move in was just a way for OP to feel better about being an absentee spouse/parent.", "No you didn\u2019t go off information provided you both did the same thing just in the opposite directions. You assumed the support she has is good and helpful, the other person assumed it could be overwhelming and causing mental health issues. You are not making assumptions so please don\u2019t act all high and mighty about your POV.", "The difference between you and the previous poster is that you\u2019re accepting the OP\u2019s self-serving narrative as gospel while they are willing to consider that there could be (and likely is) another side to this story.", "I don't see any issue with the communication coming from OP.\n\nThe wife suggested going out, OP laid out his very understandable reasons why he didn't want to, and the wife got upset over it.\n\nAnd I'm not making up a situation for no purpose other than to get mad over it, I'm making up as situation in an attempt to get people to realize their blatant anti-man bias.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that a man trying to force his just got off a 24 hour shift wife to take him out to dinner would be unanimously called an asshole.", "So, she should wait to go out until he\u2019s finished residency. That\u2019s what you are actually recommending.", "Women on this subs like to pretend to themselves that being SAHM is harder than working in medical field or doing real physical labor, you can't argue with their logic, they are deluded. She even has support from their in-laws", "Tell me you don't know jack shit about residency without saying you don't. It's mandatory for him to do that, not really a choice.\n\nShe has support from in laws, she can have time for herself and leave the house, he can't leave hospital. \n\nHow delusional are you?", "I think it was pretty clear he was talking about that night specifically. But if he truly meant that in such a way that he would refuse to go out at all with his wife, then yes, that's a problem. Doesn't mean he's the adult for not wanting to go out that specific night after just getting off a 24 hour shift. That said, I do think that time is limited when you're in that work situation with that home situation. And if he were forced to choose, I think choosing to spend time with his daughter over going out on a date with his wife to be the right choice. \n\n> He also said \"she is not doing anything anywhere near as physically or cognitively demanding as what I am doing.\" so clearly he thinks she's lesser than him.  \n\nThis is not him thinking she's less than him, it's simply a fact that being a resident regularly pulling 12/24 hour shifts is more challenging, physically and cognitively, then being a stay at home parent who has multiple people available to help her out.", "Depends on the town. Most do have at least a small one. But there are some that don't. Closest mall to the town I grew up in was almost an hour away - and still is to this day.", "No, I\u2019m quite literally going off of information provided by the OP.  You\u2019re arguing with a bunch of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and \u201cwell maybe this\u2019s\u201d just like every other woman does in this sub with situations involving a SAHM and a working father/husband.  It\u2019s never reciprocated when the genders get reversed but you\u2019d have to argue in good faith for that.", "That\u2019s a funny way for you to say \u201cI\u2019m going to ignore the only information provided and invent my own false narrative and run with it\u201d.  It\u2019s one thing to try and see the other side.  It\u2019s something completely different to make stuff up then use that made up stuff to label the guy an asshole.  Do you not see the difference?", "okie dokie", "I mean, he's working 80 hour weeks when there's 168 hours in a week. If he's saying in the remaining 88 hours he doesn't have a single hour or two to spend with his wife for the entire remainder of his residency, he never should have married her and they definitely never should have had a child.", "Yeah but you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going through!  Maybe her in-laws suck!  Maybe she has PPD!  Maybe she feels isolated!  Maybe he should compromise more!  This thread is exactly why a lot of men bottle shit up inside until they explode.  You\u2019re expected to flame out so everyone else around you can burn bright and the minute you speak up you\u2019re an uncompromising absentee spouse/husband who\u2019s being an inconsiderate asshole.  Just shut your mouth and keep providing.  No rest for the weary.", "Work in a hospital, he made the choice to go into that profession with the knowledge of what it entailed.", "You can disagree all you want, but both of you are making assumptions. You think you\u2019re unbiased, but you\u2019re also drawing conclusions. I\u2019m not going to argue you about it because clearly you\u2019re incapable of a little self-reflection. And yes, that\u2019s a conclusion I\u2019ve drawn based on the way you speak to people.", "Communicating my own experiences as an example of a dynamic OP may be overlooking I his own household is \u201cmaking stuff up\u201d?  Are we living in some kind of Matrix-style environment where my own lives experiences are a false narrative I\u2019ve invented?", "She married someone who is working in that profession with knowledge of what it entailed.\n\nYou sound entitled af."]}
