Even when someone else has the baby I can guarantee she\u2019s thinking about when the baby has to eat next, has the baby had enough to eat, has she wet enough diapers, did that last round of bottle get sterilized for long enough, etc. imagine caring for a newborn all day as being in surgery for 24 hours straight. By all means, spend as much time as you possibly can with your newborn. The days are long but the months are extremely extremely short.

Your wife already sees little of you, plus being a new mom can be extremely emotionally draining (her in laws might help with the physical stuff but can\u2019t help there, in fact, might make things worse).

She also has no one-on-one time with you. She is around y'alls baby and your parents 24/7.  Her wanting to go out is likely not just her being burned out, it's her wanting to spend one-on-one time with the man she married, to have a little romance, to feel love between you two.

I'm not spending nearly as much time with her as I should.\"\n\nThis makes me think that he is not going to make time for his wife in the near future.

He ended up quitting cocaine but took morphine until the day he died.", "You absolutely have to keep your own notes. \"We will put that in the notes in the chart. We will update the chart so we will see it next time. Let me put that in the chart.\"\n\n*No one reads the fucking chart!*", "Yeah, the whole model of med school & residency is built on substance abuse--then people are shocked and horrified that doctors (and other med pros) end up using drugs to cope with the hours/expectations while suffering from depression and PTSD from the moral injuries the system incurs.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety! And the science/history of addiction is fascinating. I knew Halsted used cocaine (as did Freud), but I didn't know the rest.", "It only used to be \"less dangerous\" because the man who basically pioneered it was famously ravenously addicted to cocaine and morphine. Look him up. William Steward Halstead.", "It\u2019s disgusting how blatantly sexist this subreddit is. All women are flawless and all men are worse than Hitler, according to this sub.", "Its really wild. There's a great show that I started watching in early recovery called the mick. Its loosely based on Halsted's life. That's kind of how I got into the science behind recovery. In early recovery you have a lot of free time. Free time is hard when your just starting to get sober. My wife and child left so for me it was 60 hours of work and 30 hours of rehab a week. We took weekends off recovery so those where the hardest. Luckily my wife would let me see my child so I would mostly do that on weekends and watch tv shows. So I made challenge for myself that everyday I would look to find new science on recovery. It was very beneficial. \n\nThe biggest thing I learned and what helped me the most was green nature. Its proven that seeing lots of green throughout nature helps with depression and anxiety. So now I surround myself with green. My wife has about 40 indoor plants now and we have a garden and lots of trees. I very much love plants now.", "Look I\u2019m not lying I frequently work shifts where I\u2019m the only ER doctor and sometimes the only doctor in the building but yes thank you for reminding me of how much people love to secretly record healthcare workers to attempt to publicly embarrass us sue us etc\u2026 I can add it to my list of reasons I\u2019m quitting the moment my loans are paid off and you guys can figure out how to deal with the shortage of healthcare workers on your own. Have a pleasant day", "I hate being the one to always point it out but goddamn, it\u2019s so bad man. The entertainment is tainted when it\u2019s always coloured with people getting off on their personal biases and congregating in their groupthink projections."]}
