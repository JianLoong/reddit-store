Knowing in advance gives you time to prepare mentally so it doesn't happen when you're all geared up for a relaxing night at home after work. You can also seek out quieter venues that won't make you feel as stressed. You could even leave all the details of where she'd like to go up to her so that you don't have to worry about planning, as you mention suffering from burnout.\n\nIt may also help if you plan on a daddy daughter night.

Staying home with a newborn as a first time mother with your in laws is incredibly mentally taxing. She\u2019s not only been thrown into this brand new life altering thing but it\u2019s 24/7. Even when someone else has the baby I can guarantee she\u2019s thinking about when the baby has to eat next, has the baby had enough to eat, has she wet enough diapers, did that last round of bottle get sterilized for long enough, etc. imagine caring for a newborn all day as being in surgery for 24 hours straight. By all means, spend as much time as you possibly can with your newborn. The days are long but the months are extremely extremely short.

The night out isn't about you, it's about what she needs after months of dealing with a baby that she grew inside her body and pushed out all by herself \\[not as 'physically demanding'? Okay sure Jan\\]. Yeah you have an infant child, and yeah you want to spend time with her, but you can't do that at the expense of the woman who birthed her unless you want to lose her.", "YTA. Not for wanting to spend time at home, but for discounting your wife\u2019s energy and desires by reasoning that because what you\u2019re doing is more difficult, what you want matters more.

She\u2019s obviously doing more than that since she\u2019s taking care of a newborn and your parents (if it\u2019s true what you say that they live with you rather than y\u2019all living with them).\n\nAlso YTA for making this about your daughter, when it really seems to me more about just you being tired. It\u2019s okay to be tired. What you\u2019re doing is hard.

She is essentially raising your child as a single parent if you are working 80 hours a week. It is not unreasonable at all for her to want to have a romantic evening with her husband because she probably feels lonely and unloved with you being gone all of the time. Your daughter is what? 1-2 years old? She is not going to remember you playing with her for a night but your wife will remember that you stopped prioritizing your relationship with her and that could lead to a divorce.", "If you don't cultivate and maintain your relationship with your wife you'll find yourself with relationship problems and even divorce down the line. \n\nShe's asking for a date every once in awhile. It's not much to ask.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Because you have a baby now, your relationship with your wife doesn\u2019t matter? And don\u2019t be so quick to undermine the work that goes into being a parent.

You and your wife made an immature decision to have a child at this time.", "NAH I think it\u2019s really admirable that you want to spend time with your wife and baby.

Try to understand her perspective.", "NAH, because I understand where you\u2019re coming from. Indeed you have a very demanding and exhausting job and it must suck to not be able to spend more time with your newborn. BUT you\u2019re not doing your marriage any favors. Your wife already sees little of you, plus being a new mom can be extremely emotionally draining (your in laws might help with the physical stuff but can\u2019t help there, in fact, might make things worse). Many relationships suffer when a child comes because parents forget to nurture themselves as a couple too, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing right now.  If on top of that you add the mentality that what she does is not as exhausting as what you do, then you\u2019re already on a downhill path you\u2019ll regret.

What will she do then? \n\nI know she's probably grieving her previous life and wanting to do something \"normal\" but she needs to read the room a bit better.

Unplanned pregnancies happen regularly. If they were already married and wanted a kid at some point in the near term anyway, I can see why they'd keep it. And considering they have supportive parents, and he's doing his ~~internship~~ residency to be a doctor I doubt money is a concern. But I **really, really** wanna highlight the timing of the pregnancy. The Dobbs v Jackson ruling overturning Roe v Wade occurred June 24th last year, and average human gestation is 40 weeks: they could have a 10 day old infant at home that was conceived *the actual day* it was overturned. If it was unwanted, and they lived in the wrong state, and they couldn't afford to travel elsewhere to get an abortion...this is literally what happens. Considering that most women don't even discover they're pregnant until somewhere in week 4 to 7, they very well may have a two month old at home that fits the same profile.\n\nSo while I agree the timing sucks, it's not necessarily something worth judging him for, because we don't know the details that actually matter when it comes to that particular decision.\n\nEdit: words and phrasing", "Misremembering- thought he was doing internship not residency.
