He has an 11 year old son Noah with his late wife Ashley. Dan and I met 2 years after Ashley died. We started out as friends and became more over time. We didn't rush anything and gave Noah time to get used to me being in his life. He and I have always gotten along well so over time we married and have two little ones of our own together. Noah sees his maternal family semi-regularly. They live about two hours from us but always invite him to every party and gathering and whether it's his grandparents or one of his aunts or uncles, he is invited along to join them and his cousins for outings and stuff. Dan and Ashley's family were never super close but seem to get along. While her family and I are civil but not at all close. Noah loves his family and he loves seeing them so that's the main thing.\n\nNoah doesn't call me mom, and doesn't refer to me as his mom to others. I'm his stepmom. That has never been a problem for us, though some have questioned why Noah wouldn't have naturally started calling me mom over time or letting it slip sometimes. I have never seen it as a big deal.\n\nOne of the people who has commented on it a couple of times is my MIL. She asked me had I ever asked him to call me mom or have I ever told him I would like him to. I always told her I did not ask or tell him to because it should be his choice, on his terms, not on mine. She accepted that, or told me she did anyway, and we didn't hear about it for years.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago I was dropping something off at MILs house, and MIL told Noah to \"give this to your mom\" because I had my hands full. He told her I wasn't his mom, I'm his stepmom. She looked for me to correct him but I said nothing. She told him that stepmom's are mom's too. He said I was Kaia and Dex's mom (my kids) and I was his stepmom because he has another mom. I saw MIL getting ready to debate him over this so I moved things along and we left. MIL told my husband what happened and he was asking her why it was a big enough deal to bring up. She told him I should have said something to Noah for correcting her or should have stopped him from doing it at least. He said that seemed like a bad idea and a perfect way to start a push on his boundaries. She told me I was rude to her and I am letting Noah exclude himself from the family. She said he would be happier if I took step out of the equation.\n\nAITA for how I handled this?", "created_utc": 1682762539, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132oxuj/aita_for_letting_my_stepson_correct_my_mil/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I only intervened when she was getting ready to turn it into a debate with him. Perhaps I should have stepped in. My stepson wasn't rude in how he said it to MIL but maybe there was something else I could have done here.

Your SS is perfectly allowed to state his views on who his parents are. Your MIL sounds like an entitled boomer that clearly thinks her opinions are more important than this kid\u2019s self identity. You sound like you are doing an AMAZING job at this step mom gig by the way. He will look back fondly knowing that you supported him and found his views and feelings to be of value. You are a selfless and generous and caring and the world need more people just like you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMIL i s the AH here .. he was RIGHT to correct her. She NEEDED to be corrected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She said he would be happier if I took step out of the equation.\" .. MIL is wrong, and is an AH for trying to stir you up against each other. MAybe LESS CONTACT WITH MIL would be good for Noah.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly. His mom has passed. If and when he chooses to call you mom will be his choice. MIL needs to stay in her own lane.", "OP, your MIL made a fool of herself by stepping in to \"fix\" something that wasn't broken, presuming to parent a kid who's not her kid, and trying to triangulate by complaining to your husband when her attempts went sideways. None of those actions ended well for her -- thank goodness for calm and solid boundaries!\n\nSo she doubled down: threw an unfair accusation and an open, direct insult towards you:\n\n>She told me *I was rude to her* and I am letting Noah exclude himself from the family. She said *he would be happier if I took step out of the equation*\n\nwhich I'm guessing means, she inferred that Noah would be better off if you -- his stepmom -- disregarded his own strong preferences. Say WHAT???\n\nWhen cows are wrecking wire fences by leaning on them, we electrify the top strand. When a MIL is stomping boundaries, we let our husband tell their mother to knock it off or there will be world-changing consequences. Now would be a very good time for your hubby to do that, with some voltage.\n\nNTA and I'm glad Noah has you in his life. You did nothing wrong and don't you dare apologize to the cow, I mean MIL", "NTA I think you are handling this really well.", "NTA, you're doing good", "NTA in the slightest. he's comfortable and happy as you are, and so are you! no one else gets to have a say in it, and it's good that he felt safe enough to stand his ground. from what you said, he did it firmly but politely, and if your MIL has a problem with it then she should stop trying to pressure the kiddo over something that's none of her concern.", "NTA. His choice.", "Your MIL sees herself as \"on your side\" - and you don't want to piss off an advocate.  I'm sure if you sat down again with her she would explain to you that she herself, as a mother, would think you would want to be held in as close esteem as any \"mom\" would.  And perhaps she has opinions about how this would affect Noah's feelings toward you - even though the person you're displacing in the \"mom\" title is her own, prematurely deceased daughter.  That's quite a giving and loving position she is in.   \n\n\nSo perhaps you can tell her that you yourself do feel you are his \"mom\".  And has his mom, you have decided - use the word \"decided\" - that Noah is allowed to assert himself on who holds what position in his emotional life.   Reassure her that you aren't hurt by it, and you are just honored to be Noah's mom, even if he isn't calling you that.    \n\n\nIn short, make it clear that of everyone involved, it is only she who is upset by this language - and that everyone else, especially you and Noah the two people most directly concerned - are happy.    She can chose  if she wants to be happy in that situation, too.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. There are so many posts here where trying to force the bereaved child to call the new parent mom or dad causes the relationship to break down completely.  You\u2019re letting Noah see he can trust you to respect his feelings and boundaries, and that gives you a platform to build your relationship with him that has solid foundations.", "NTA. Good for you!", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re handling this exactly the right way. \n\nHis late mother will always be \u201cmom\u201d to him, most likely. You\u2019re showing a lot of love and understanding to not push the issue, and I\u2019m sure he appreciates that, or will as he gets older. \n\nI\u2019m sure you know this, he\u2019s correcting your MIL because he wants to remember his mother, not at all to exclude you. \n\nYou and the kid both sound like great people. He\u2019s lucky to have a wonderful stepmom.", "NTA what Noah calls you is up to him. And good on you for remembering that. One day he may call you mum or he may always call you stepmum doesn't mean there isn't love there. It is absolutely not MILs choice or business", "NTA at all!\n\nYou have respected your SS boundaries and recognise that while he may love you and care for you he will always have his real Mom. and that is just awesome.\n\nYou MIL is wrong to try and make him call you Mom and even more wrong to try and have you correct that instinct.", "NTA", "Talk to Noah. Reaffirm that you love him and love having him in the family but also that he has a mum and that mil was wrong to try to force him to call you mum. Tell him that you two know who you are to each other and say how proud you are of him. \n\nIgnore mil, she sounds annoying. Actually next time I would shut her down in support of Noah.", "NTA but it's a bit odd in the circumstances that Noah made an issue of it. Given that he did, this is a pretty serious boundary for him and you were definitely right not to push it in this context at all. \n\nAll that said, have you talked to Noah about it? Does he know he is welcome to call you his mom? If it's not broke, don't fix it, but you seem to have been there over half his life at this point.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
