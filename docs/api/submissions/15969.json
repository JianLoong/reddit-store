Noah sees his maternal family semi-regularly. They live about two hours from us but always invite him to every party and gathering and whether it's his grandparents or one of his aunts or uncles, he is invited along to join them and his cousins for outings and stuff. Dan and Ashley's family were never super close but seem to get along. While her family and I are civil but not at all close. Noah loves his family and he loves seeing them so that's the main thing.\n\nNoah doesn't call me mom, and doesn't refer to me as his mom to others. I'm his stepmom. That has never been a problem for us, though some have questioned why Noah wouldn't have naturally started calling me mom over time or letting it slip sometimes. I have never seen it as a big deal.\n\nOne of the people who has commented on it a couple of times is my MIL. She asked me had I ever asked him to call me mom or have I ever told him I would like him to. I always told her I did not ask or tell him to because it should be his choice, on his terms, not on mine. She accepted that, or told me she did anyway, and we didn't hear about it for years.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago I was dropping something off at MILs house, and MIL told Noah to \"give this to your mom\" because I had my hands full. He told her I wasn't his mom, I'm his stepmom. She looked for me to correct him but I said nothing. She told him that stepmom's are mom's too. He said I was Kaia and Dex's mom (my kids) and I was his stepmom because he has another mom. I saw MIL getting ready to debate him over this so I moved things along and we left. MIL told my husband what happened and he was asking her why it was a big enough deal to bring up. She told him I should have said something to Noah for correcting her or should have stopped him from doing it at least. He said that seemed like a bad idea and a perfect way to start a push on his boundaries. She told me I was rude to her and I am letting Noah exclude himself from the family.

None of those actions ended well for her -- thank goodness for calm and solid boundaries!\n\nSo she doubled down: threw an unfair accusation and an open, direct insult towards you:\n\n>She told me *I was rude to her* and I am letting Noah exclude himself from the family. She said *he would be happier if I took step out of the equation*\n\nwhich I'm guessing means, she inferred that Noah would be better off if you -- his stepmom -- disregarded his own strong preferences.

His choice.", "Your MIL sees herself as \"on your side\" - and you don't want to piss off an advocate.  I'm sure if you sat down again with her she would explain to you that she herself, as a mother, would think you would want to be held in as close esteem as any \"mom\" would.  And perhaps she has opinions about how this would affect Noah's feelings toward you - even though the person you're displacing in the \"mom\" title is her own, prematurely deceased daughter.  That's quite a giving and loving position she is in.   \n\n\nSo perhaps you can tell her that you yourself do feel you are his \"mom\".  And has his mom, you have decided - use the word \"decided\" - that Noah is allowed to assert himself on who holds what position in his emotional life.   Reassure her that you aren't hurt by it, and you are just honored to be Noah's mom, even if he isn't calling you that.    \n\n\nIn short, make it clear that of everyone involved, it is only she who is upset by this language - and that everyone else, especially you and Noah the two people most directly concerned - are happy.

There are so many posts here where trying to force the bereaved child to call the new parent mom or dad causes the relationship to break down completely.

Good for you!", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re handling this exactly the right way. \n\nHis late mother will always be \u201cmom\u201d to him, most likely. You\u2019re showing a lot of love and understanding to not push the issue, and I\u2019m sure he appreciates that, or will as he gets older. \n\nI\u2019m sure you know this, he\u2019s correcting your MIL because he wants to remember his mother, not at all to exclude you. \n\nYou and the kid both sound like great people. He\u2019s lucky to have a wonderful stepmom.", "NTA what Noah calls you is up to him. And good on you for remembering that. One day he may call you mum or he may always call you stepmum doesn't mean there isn't love there. It is absolutely not MILs choice or business", "NTA at all!\n\nYou have respected your SS boundaries and recognise that while he may love you and care for you he will always have his real Mom. and that is just awesome.\n\nYou MIL is wrong to try and make him call you Mom and even more wrong to try and have you correct that instinct.", "NTA", "Talk to Noah.

Actually next time I would shut her down in support of Noah.", "NTA but it's a bit odd in the circumstances that Noah made an issue of it. Given that he did, this is a pretty serious boundary for him and you were definitely right not to push it in this context at all. \n\nAll that said, have you talked to Noah about it?

It\u2019s the people you allow into your life. \n\nMIL better get onboard with that way of thinking, fast, or she\u2019s gonna find herself without some key members of HER family. \n\nNTA.

She is being bizarrely intrusive. She was incorrect, and there is nothing rude about being corrected. What a weird thing for her to get her shorts knotted up so tightly.", "NTA. You\u2019re letting Noah decide what level of relationship he is comfortable with.

It never ends well.", "NTA\n\nI think you should let your step son do something to celebrate Ashley this mothers days to show you still support his decisions and and are happy as his step mom.

It doesn't diminish the relationship you have. If he called her mum it would be just as wrong and also wouldn't diminish what they have. If he's happy with it how things are, that's the main thing.   \n\n\nOne benefit of being a step-parent are you won't be as likely to cause trauma by making him feel like you're pushing his mum out. She may have passed, but she earned the right to remain a part of his identity and you're respecting that as a good step-mum should. The other benefit is you can be what he needs and he can lead that. Parents don't get that chance because they're there before the kid is able to express themselves. Noah was 5 though if my maths is right and very capable of leading what relationship he needed and wanted with you. Personally, I think that's precious and worth protecting. On this matter your MIL's opinion is worthless and she needs to respect Noah and your choice.", "You seem like an awesome stepmom. Noah seems like a smart kid. It doesn't seem like there's animosity in calling you stepmom. Just facts. I call my step-dad by his first name since grade 3 when we met. I have probably called him dad once. I'm 36. I did call my step mom. Mom. Whatever feels right. Let the kid choose.", "NTA.\n\nCan I just say, you are doing an AMAZING job. The fact that you are letting him set his own boundaries with this and are willing to be patient in letting him process everything... my God, lady; if you're not a Saint, you should be.\n\nSounds to me like MIL is just wanting to make herself look better. \"Your mother is dead, so call step-mother 'mom' because you need to get over it.\" Like... if his birth mother never existed, he wouldn't either. And for MIL to force HER ideals on her grandchild is just selfish.\n\nBased solely on how you're treating him, Noah might call you mom one day. And that would be great. But for now, you're doing an incredible honor to his mother by letting him deal with it on his own time.", "As a farmer I love this.", "THiS!!", "NTA and I agree with him having the boundary and speaking up about it when his grandma challenges. I would suggest talking to Noah here to see if he would like your assistance in holding this boundary, as he is quite young and may need an adult to help.", "I can completely relate to this post.  My stepson has called me by my first name because I never wanted to force the issue.  I have been around since he was 2 (now 21). Fast forward a few years and husband and I had a child together.  He also calls me by my first name...because his brother does that is 6 years older.  When referring to me to someone else I'm referred to as his mom, but when speaking directly to me, it has been my first name.  This has never bothered me, and honestly I am sometimes relieved because I was the only person that didn't have to look up when some kid yelled mom.   \n\nMy MIL expressed at some point that it was a complete lack of respect.  Honestly it was none of her business and I couldn't care less what she thinks, but I can appreciate the situation you're in.  No one gets to tell you what works for your family in your house.    My kids are almost adults now and still call me by my first name.", "NTA\n\nI have a mom. She died.

That shit hurts my feelings and I will respond to that with a heart-felt rage so hot I didn't think I still had the ability to go that hot-headed anymore. \n\nIt's been twenty years for me. I'm so old most of my friends from college are seeing their kids off to uni and a few of them have grandkids.

She had absolutely no right to try to force her opinion into a situation she isn't a part of. \n\nWell done you, for respecting your stepson. There's no dishonour in being a \"step\"mom. My own stepmother embraced the title her entire life. It does not diminish her or her contributions to my life in any way. She isn't my mother and never will be, but she will always be my stepmother, and that does not make her *less*.  \n\nThe nicest thing about the thing we call \"love\" is that it isn't a finite resource.
