Noah sees his maternal family semi-regularly. They live about two hours from us but always invite him to every party and gathering and whether it's his grandparents or one of his aunts or uncles, he is invited along to join them and his cousins for outings and stuff. Dan and Ashley's family were never super close but seem to get along. While her family and I are civil but not at all close. Noah loves his family and he loves seeing them so that's the main thing.\n\nNoah doesn't call me mom, and doesn't refer to me as his mom to others. I'm his stepmom. That has never been a problem for us, though some have questioned why Noah wouldn't have naturally started calling me mom over time or letting it slip sometimes. I have never seen it as a big deal.\n\nOne of the people who has commented on it a couple of times is my MIL. She asked me had I ever asked him to call me mom or have I ever told him I would like him to. I always told her I did not ask or tell him to because it should be his choice, on his terms, not on mine. She accepted that, or told me she did anyway, and we didn't hear about it for years.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago I was dropping something off at MILs house, and MIL told Noah to \"give this to your mom\" because I had my hands full. He told her I wasn't his mom, I'm his stepmom. She looked for me to correct him but I said nothing. She told him that stepmom's are mom's too. He said I was Kaia and Dex's mom (my kids) and I was his stepmom because he has another mom. I saw MIL getting ready to debate him over this so I moved things along and we left. MIL told my husband what happened and he was asking her why it was a big enough deal to bring up. She told him I should have said something to Noah for correcting her or should have stopped him from doing it at least. He said that seemed like a bad idea and a perfect way to start a push on his boundaries. She told me I was rude to her and I am letting Noah exclude himself from the family.

None of those actions ended well for her -- thank goodness for calm and solid boundaries!\n\nSo she doubled down: threw an unfair accusation and an open, direct insult towards you:\n\n>She told me *I was rude to her* and I am letting Noah exclude himself from the family. She said *he would be happier if I took step out of the equation*\n\nwhich I'm guessing means, she inferred that Noah would be better off if you -- his stepmom -- disregarded his own strong preferences.

His choice.", "Your MIL sees herself as \"on your side\" - and you don't want to piss off an advocate.  I'm sure if you sat down again with her she would explain to you that she herself, as a mother, would think you would want to be held in as close esteem as any \"mom\" would.  And perhaps she has opinions about how this would affect Noah's feelings toward you - even though the person you're displacing in the \"mom\" title is her own, prematurely deceased daughter.  That's quite a giving and loving position she is in.   \n\n\nSo perhaps you can tell her that you yourself do feel you are his \"mom\".  And has his mom, you have decided - use the word \"decided\" - that Noah is allowed to assert himself on who holds what position in his emotional life.   Reassure her that you aren't hurt by it, and you are just honored to be Noah's mom, even if he isn't calling you that.    \n\n\nIn short, make it clear that of everyone involved, it is only she who is upset by this language - and that everyone else, especially you and Noah the two people most directly concerned - are happy.

Good for you!", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re handling this exactly the right way. \n\nHis late mother will always be \u201cmom\u201d to him, most likely.

Actually next time I would shut her down in support of Noah.", "NTA but it's a bit odd in the circumstances that Noah made an issue of it. Given that he did, this is a pretty serious boundary for him and you were definitely right not to push it in this context at all. \n\nAll that said, have you talked to Noah about it?

It\u2019s the people you allow into your life. \n\nMIL better get onboard with that way of thinking, fast, or she\u2019s gonna find herself without some key members of HER family. \n\nNTA.

She is being bizarrely intrusive. She was incorrect, and there is nothing rude about being corrected. What a weird thing for her to get her shorts knotted up so tightly.", "NTA. You\u2019re letting Noah decide what level of relationship he is comfortable with.

It never ends well.", "NTA\n\nI think you should let your step son do something to celebrate Ashley this mothers days to show you still support his decisions and and are happy as his step mom.

It doesn't diminish the relationship you have. If he called her mum it would be just as wrong and also wouldn't diminish what they have. If he's happy with it how things are, that's the main thing.   \n\n\nOne benefit of being a step-parent are you won't be as likely to cause trauma by making him feel like you're pushing his mum out. She may have passed, but she earned the right to remain a part of his identity and you're respecting that as a good step-mum should. The other benefit is you can be what he needs and he can lead that. Parents don't get that chance because they're there before the kid is able to express themselves. Noah was 5 though if my maths is right and very capable of leading what relationship he needed and wanted with you. Personally, I think that's precious and worth protecting. On this matter your MIL's opinion is worthless and she needs to respect Noah and your choice.", "You seem like an awesome stepmom. Noah seems like a smart kid. It doesn't seem like there's animosity in calling you stepmom. Just facts. I call my step-dad by his first name since grade 3 when we met. I have probably called him dad once. I'm 36. I did call my step mom. Mom. Whatever feels right. Let the kid choose.", "NTA.\n\nCan I just say, you are doing an AMAZING job. The fact that you are letting him set his own boundaries with this and are willing to be patient in letting him process everything... my God, lady; if you're not a Saint, you should be.\n\nSounds to me like MIL is just wanting to make herself look better. \"Your mother is dead, so call step-mother 'mom' because you need to get over it.\" Like... if his birth mother never existed, he wouldn't either. And for MIL to force HER ideals on her grandchild is just selfish.\n\nBased solely on how you're treating him, Noah might call you mom one day. And that would be great. But for now, you're doing an incredible honor to his mother by letting him deal with it on his own time.", "As a farmer I love this.", "THiS!!", "NTA and I agree with him having the boundary and speaking up about it when his grandma challenges. I would suggest talking to Noah here to see if he would like your assistance in holding this boundary, as he is quite young and may need an adult to help.", "I can completely relate to this post.  My stepson has called me by my first name because I never wanted to force the issue.  I have been around since he was 2 (now 21). Fast forward a few years and husband and I had a child together.  He also calls me by my first name...because his brother does that is 6 years older.  When referring to me to someone else I'm referred to as his mom, but when speaking directly to me, it has been my first name.  This has never bothered me, and honestly I am sometimes relieved because I was the only person that didn't have to look up when some kid yelled mom.   \n\nMy MIL expressed at some point that it was a complete lack of respect.  Honestly it was none of her business and I couldn't care less what she thinks, but I can appreciate the situation you're in.  No one gets to tell you what works for your family in your house.    My kids are almost adults now and still call me by my first name.", "NTA\n\nI have a mom. She died.

That shit hurts my feelings and I will respond to that with a heart-felt rage so hot I didn't think I still had the ability to go that hot-headed anymore. \n\nIt's been twenty years for me. I'm so old most of my friends from college are seeing their kids off to uni and a few of them have grandkids.

She had absolutely no right to try to force her opinion into a situation she isn't a part of. \n\nWell done you, for respecting your stepson. There's no dishonour in being a \"step\"mom. My own stepmother embraced the title her entire life. It does not diminish her or her contributions to my life in any way. She isn't my mother and never will be, but she will always be my stepmother, and that does not make her *less*.  \n\nThe nicest thing about the thing we call \"love\" is that it isn't a finite resource.

I let him come to me about things and I don't go rat him out to his parents on things he talks to me about (unless it's a safety issue, which he is aware of.)", "Leave it to a boomer to make something about them that wasn't specifically about them.", "Thank you...I feel the same.", "NTA \n\nMIL made a fool out of herself and needed to be corrected.", "First of all, he doesn't exclude anyone just because he calls you stepmom. \nSounds he understands the complexity of the situation and still respect you and as part of his family, even if the title is different.\n\nMIL need to understand the situation and listen to the 11 year boy, which have much better understanding the. Her. NTA", "MIL is the only one who is rude.  She is creating unnecessary drama.  You are handling the situation exactly right.  Let the child decide what they are comfortable with calling you.

There will not be an apology because we did nothing wrong, you just didn't like getting no for an answer. Noah is well within his rights to state a boundary, we don't view it as disrespectful. We understand you're upset, but this is your issue to work through, not ours.\"\n\nI have a crappy MIL so I've had to practice & use lines like this A LOT.", "you handled this text book perfect. great job.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you are showing some awesome parenting skills.\n\nIn Noah's mind, mom and stepmom are quite distinct. For him he knows that mom is Ashley and stepmom is you. No one else has this issue. I assume that he is probably quite literal about other things as well. It doesn't matter, his boundaries are his boundaries, and it is wonderful that you respect them.\n\nI don't understand where your MIL is actually coming from. It would make better sense to me if this were coming from your mom rather than your MIL. Her position is odd because as stated, it would be Noah excluding you from the family and not himself. \n\nNot excusing the MIL but part of this may be the common negative stereotype of stepmom as a title in her mind. How nice it would have been if, when corrected, your MIL had simply said, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I know that. Please give this to your stepmom\" and just moved on from there.", "I think NTA. I am curious though, how old was poor Noah when his mom passed away?", "NTA. He's happy with the situation. You're happy with the situation. No one else's opinion matters. She was trying to force him to do something he didn't want, and it had nothing to do with stopping him from jumping in front of a moving car or something else dangerous, so he had every right to stand up for himself.\n\nAm I getting this right? His mother's mother wants you to replace her daughter as his mother? Because that's weird.", "NTA. You are respecting the child's boundaries, your MIL is not. She's the only one in the wrong now.", "I loved reading this becuase you are about as perfect a step parent as a step parent can be the wellbeing of the child being center stage and honouring his mom regardless of her still being among the living or not. MIL's behaviour is toxic and manipulative she needs to keep her nose out of this and stick to facts which is that OP is Noah's step mom while late Ashley is his mom. NTA", "NTA I would like to think that your MIL has good intentions, but a very bad way of going about it. And you are very correct that it is something that is up to your step son and only your step son. I commend you for thinking this way, a lot of widows and new spouses like to push for the children to call the new step parent mom or dad and it is not healthy to push onto a child that is not ready. My mom and my step dad got married when I was 14 and I am 31 now. I call him by his name when I talk to him because it just feels natural and normal but I always refer to him as my dad in front of him and also when he is not around. When I talk to anyone about my dad, I am always talking about him. Kids just need time and to be able to do things like this their own way.", "nta and buy noah some of his favorite snacks", "Exactly, the only one acting like step-parents are lesser is MIL!", "You sound like a bigot. Not all people in their age group act entitled.", "Trying to force a family bond is a common element in a lot of stories about step families not getting along. It causes resentment and actively stops a bond from forming naturally.", "Actually the MIL is probably that sneaky Gen X", "Nta you handled it perfectly", "NTA. \n\n>She told him that stepmom's are mom's too. \n\nThey sure are, which is why \"stepmom\" is not a disrespectful or 'lesser' title, it's just a statement of fact. Calling you his stepmom does not negate all of the things you are to him or the bond you share. Not only are you NTA, but you standing up for your stepson and his boundaries is only going to strengthen your relationship with him, and cement yourself as someone he can trust. Great job, OP.", "NTA in fact that was the perfect way to respond and let your step son set his own boundaries. I would maybe check in with him to let him know that you love him, and that you\u2019re honored to be in his life and that while you know you\u2019ll never replace his mom that he\u2019s more than welcome to call you or refer to you with whatever he\u2019s most comfortable with.", "NTA. You and stepson have it worked out, both are comfortable with things. MIL was out of bounds on pushing this. If Dan has no problem with his son calling you his stepmom and you don't, she has no say and you aren't rude to not stop him from correcting her.", "NTA at all. You're absolutely correct to let Noah choose the terms of your relationship.", "Yeah, your husband needs to put his mom in her place and shut this down hard. \n\nPlus, she's a mom herself. Can she not imagine if she died and another woman came into her young son's life and people tried to force him to call her mom. Does his mom have no empathy?", "As a kid I thought it was kinda weird to call parents - who are our closest relationships for a good part of our lives and who we live with for typically two decades - by titles and not their first names. \n\n\"Mom\" and \"Dad\" is kinda like going to school and saying \"good morning teacher\" instead of the more familiar \"Mr. Whatchamacallit.\"  \ud83e\udd14", "You sound like you have poor reading comprehension.

It would be no different to saying entitled zoomers, or entitled men etc etc. The not all is in the context.", "Gen Xers don't give a fuck about anything, especially social appearances. So yeah, no. \n\n\\- cynical punk Gen Xer here", "Oh please, like other generations don\u2019t do the same,", "LOL", "NTA. Of course stepmoms are moms. That's why \"mom\" is right in there. If he wanted to make it clear that you aren't any kind of mom to him you'd be \"dad's wife\" or your first name, \"step\" is not a dirty word", "NTA. Losing a parent is incredibly hard for a kid. Giving the title that you attached to a very specific/important person to someone else will often just feel wrong. Theres no shame in that, and if he wants to remember his bio-mom with that title, then that's his right. If you're comfortable with the title he uses for you, then that's fantastic. It means he'll get older with an understanding that you'll respect his boundaries and won't try to push away someone he loves, even if she's passed", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMIL only cares about what she wants to see. She doesn't care about how her grandson or you feels about your relationship. That's why she's trying to manipulate you all into slapping her \"fake perfect label\"on to your family because she doesn't believe that a step family can be perfect too. \n\nAlso it's her ego that's asking for an apology. She ain't hurt. She's embarrassed because she threw a tantrum to try to get her way so she's trying push her shame into guilt on to you.", "You handled this perfectly. NTA.\n\nBut I would have a chat to Noah to make sure he understands that you're absolutely fine with your relationship as it is, and that you don't secretly long for him to call you Mom.", "NTA. Your MIL clearly ovetstepped her boundaries.\n\nHowever, she was on your side. I wouldnt disregard that and alienate her. Also, just because you agree with the content of Noah's response, doesn't mean you must agree with its style. Did he disrespect his grandmother? If so, he also overstepped his boundaries, regardless of being in the right, and should be educated or disciplined.", "AS long as you and your step son are fine with how he address's you then it is no one else's business.  NTA", "NTA as someone who has a step mother you did the right thing. I have never referee to her as my mom I have a mom. I use her first name she is mom to my step brothers. Likewise my step brothers call my dad their step dad by his first name. Neither have ever asked that we change it. I still give her a gift on Mother\u2019s Day as she has been good to me and respected my boundaries without pushing. Also I know it makes her happy. MIL way out of line", "NTA.  My nieces don't call my SIL mom.  They call her by her first name (she suggested that).  They do laugh when people comment on what lovely daughters she has.  One incredibly pushy person insisted on gushing about how the girls looked just like G, even after G was introduced as my brother's second wife.  G was speechless.  R (oldest niece) said \"I guess it's true.  When you live with someone for a while you do start to look like them.\"  The person again stressed how much the girls looked like \"their mom.\"  M (youngest niece) said, \"How do you know if we look like our mom?  You haven't ever met our mom.\"  Shut that person right up.  G has always made it clear that she's honored to be stepmom, but has no claim on \"Mom.\"  \n\nThe only one who needed to be corrected was MIL.  Noah corrected her.  Good for him.  Boys tend to be very concrete thinkers.  In Noah's mind, you are \"stepmom\" and always will be because \"Mom\" has passed away.  It doesn't mean he's excluding himself from the family.  It just means he's including his mom.\n\nHave a chat with Noah.  Tell him you are honored to be his stepmom and he can call you whatever he is comfortable with (as long as it's polite and respectful, which it undoubtedly will be).  Then stress that you consider yourself very fortunate to have him in your family and you're happy his mom's family is also in his life.  Ask him what he would like to call you and if he knows what an important part of your family/life he is.  Then your husband can reassure his mother that Noah knows exactly what to call you and that you love him.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly. MIL was out of line, not her place to say anything.", "you\u2019re NTA! you let your SS handle the situation to the best of your ability. MIL should never have tried to push his boundaries:)", "NTA and you handled this perfectly. \n\nAs long as you and Noah get along, neither of you should feel pressured to call each other mother and son. It's important for Noah to acknowledge his mother, specially since his maternal family is still involved with him.", "Nta", "Me too. Boomer shoundnt be used as a lump insult. That'd be like me saying no  young people work today", "NTA\n\nHang on give me t me tally the outcomes of the multiple AITA where children are forced to call stepmothers their mother.\n\n100% of the children hate it and grow to view it as abusive. It's abusive because it's forcing a child to do something that they'll never want to do if it's forced.\n\n100% of the biological parents that allow it or help in enforcing the change are viewed as enablers.\n\n100% of the step parents are surprised that they kid hated it and will never acknowledge that their actions were wrong. The child is obligated to consider them as a biological parent.\n\nAlso, keep your MIL away from your kid. She acted like a child and tattled on you to your husband. She's showing that she doesn't care what you want. She's consciously choosing to ignore your communication. If she can't treat you like a human being, she doesn't deserve you. \n\nShe doesn't matter at all whatsoever. Your son is the only thing that matters.\n\nMore importantly, your son is 6. He's a sponge for the world and his brain is taking it all in and developing. He doesn't need your MIL giving him a bad memory.\n\nThere are situations like yours in r/raisedby narcissists and r/JUSTNOMIL. Your MIL doesn't have to be a narcissist for you to read r/raisedbynarcissists. The posters are mostly children of parents who exist to force their will on their children. You have obvious expamples of the kids being forced into calling a step parent their biological parent and how the one time it happened became a key memory that they no longer forgot. r/JUSTNOMIL has the same issue as yours but from the parents view. Reading both subs might allow you to gain more information and insight."]}
