Three days after his funeral she found out she was expecting me. Before his dad died Nick heard him and mom arguing and knew she was with another guy. His dad's family were also told. After he died mom was told to leave the house which now belonged to Nick and was left in trust for him with his grandparents.\n\nMy mom lied to me for 8 years and in that time I believed Nick's dad was my dad. I never knew why Nick hated me or why \"our\" grandparents and aunts and uncles only wanted him. Then I found out in school. A teacher has listed just my mom as my parent on something and I asked them to add my dad's name time and he was dead but I liked to make sure his name was on stuff still. The teacher told me no father's name was listed on anything and even dead parents were on the paperwork normally, because he would be on my birth certificate.\n\nThis is when I found out the truth. Mom admitted I couldn't have been her husband's because he was sick for so long they didn't have time to make me. Nick heard us talk and said his dad would never have taken me as his kid and I could finally leave him alone now. He cut mom and me off when he turned 18, which was soon after I found out the truth.\n\nNow Nick has told mom he wants to see her over Christmas and that they need to talk. Mom believes this is going to be their reconciliation and wants us both to go and spend time with him. But I don't want to go and be hated again. I have not seen or spoken to him in 8 years and I know it could end badly. Mom told me I need to go because 16 year old boys can't be alone over the holidays. I told her I won't go so I can be reminded of how much Nick and his family hate me.

NTA", ">Mom told me I should go to be there for her if nothing else and we're supposed to stick together.\n\nMan, your mother is a real piece of work ain't she.\n\nI can't find Nick's father at fault for conspiring to shut your mother out, because she cheated on him **while he was dying,** and with regards to Nick I only find fault in him hating you, but your mother? She lied for years about something that left you confused on why you were despised by someone you thought was your immediate full brother, and then when caught in her lie she still expects you to play moral support to her bullshit?\n\nNo, you're NTA. Your mother is just proving the old stance that cheating is generally rooted in the inherent selfishness of the cheater, because your mother is just that. Selfish.", "Oh, the family and Nick are very much AHs. Nick for treating his younger half brother with disdain for something he had no control over (the circumstances of his birth) instead of focusing the anger on his mom who deserved it. And the Family for kicking a grieving 9 year old out of the house he owned for 9 years just to punish his cheating mom.", "To the grandparents OP is still the half sibling of their own grandchild. One can still decide not to have contact, but there is a relationship and honestly OP has no fault of her mum\u2019s actions. So outcast OP is a AH move", "This is a hard one. I know your mom maybe needs your emotional support but how you feel while being there is also important. Do what you feel is right. If you don\u2019t wanna go - don\u2019t go. Set these boundary. Nta", "NTA\n\nIf Nick wanted to talk to you too, he would've mentioned that. You are absolutely right not to go. \n\nIf your mom is adamant you can not be alone, She best not go and rescedule. I think offering to be alone on Christmas is very kind of you, and I trust you could, but you just shouldn't have to. \n\nNick should have chosen a better day. Who does these heavy talks on Christmas? I think it's putting too much pressure on it.\nWhich makes me actually suspicious of WHY he is doing this. He is only asking her, on christmas of all days. You could be more right than you think. It feels like a setup to hurt you and maybe also your mom. Or a test who she will choose. \n\nAnd I think deep down she knows it. Why else didn't she just ask him if you were included in the invite?", "Sounds like Nick knew since he hated OP since they were young", "Can't be cast out of something you weren't in to begin with *taps temple*", "He was never in the house she was kicked out when the husband died before she gave birth.", "The older brother? Who was 9 when his dad died? Where did you think he went to live? His mother was his legal guardian. Where she moved, he had to go with.", "Is it a relationship if they don't do anything about it though? I've got extended family that I know about but they're only \"family\" on paper. I've only met them a few times and never really spent time with them. Other than sharing some DNA (which Nick's paternal family doesn't even do with OP), they're strangers to me. And I doubt me and my extended family are a rare case", "So, let's pretend you have a son and he just died. And you learned that his wife had been cheating on him while he was sick.  And she's now pregnant with a son from her affair partner.  \n\nDo you welcome this wife and affair son with open arms into your family?", "NTA. Your mom lied to you, and created this problem by lying and cheating before that. Nick has been awful to you. It's not on you to fix this. \n\nLet your mom face Nick. He didn't invite you both - he invited her. I see this as your mom ducking responsibility. \n\nNo, you stay home, and let your mom face whatever Nick wants to talk about. That's not your problem. It's your Mom's. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, but your instincts are right, and I hope you can stick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nBut your mother and her in-laws are!\n\nYou are an innocent child who wants a loving family!\n\nYou do whatever you are most comfortable with. Simple", "Jesus, you've made me cry.\n\nNot of this is your fault at all, the onus is on your mum for cheating.\n\nIf your happy to spend time on your own then do it, because your half brother didn't mention you and your mum is trying to put you in a hard position.\n\nYour mum needs to fix this on her own, it's not your job to be their for your mum, it's your mum's job as a parent to be there for you.\n That means not putting you in a position where it could get hostile.\n\nYou don't know you half brother at all, all you do know is that he blames or blamed you for something that you had no control over.\n\nYNTA\n\nCan you give us all an update when you know what happened.", "OP is a 16 year old boy."]}
