You probably need to reevaluate your idea of what friendship is because this isn't it. \nNow I'm not sure where you live but where I live one,  that's right ONE,  reusable diaper costs more than a packet of 30 diapers so often it's not financially suitable for people to switch to more reusable options so maybe you don't know as much as you think.", "NTA\n\nWhat an entitled AH. She wants someone to buy nappies for her kids? Umm hello she's the parent, she should buy her own freaking nappies\n\nThe audacity of setting up a go fund me because she doesn't wanna pay for freaking nappies. I hope nobody gives her money because they would be an AH to themselves if they did", "NTA\n\nI find it ironic that she called you stingy while meanwhile she's being entitled. She wants someone else to buy her kids diapers, that is the most entitled thing I've ever heard. At first I was going to say you were in the wrong because I thought that you were just putting in your two cents where it didn't belong but I see that you were just trying to help her.

We ended up getting a costco membership where we got money back for purchases. While needing diapers it paid for itself and then some. I think the twins part is the issue. If they were only expecting one more kid, a surprise second can make things so much more expensive.", "Sally almost sounds like her and her husband want to spend their money on fun stuff while others take care of their essentials.", "I can say from experience what we saved using reusable ended up in a lot of water and electricity bills. Also a lot of daycares don\u2019t allow them. I still agree NTA since it was a good suggestion, just in practice might not save that much.", "I\u2019m not sure this woman understands about cloth diapers if she\u2019s saying stuff like \u201cI just want someone else to buy diapers\u201d I also don\u2019t think OP was shaming by offering a friend an option if money was tight for some reason.", "Sounds like a good idea you offered her. She\u2019s did ask, and this was an appropriate response.", "Yeah before reading the full thing I had been leaning toward a soft y-t-a just because \"Sure, say you can't donate if it's not in your budget/you think it's a frivolous ask, but don't be the AH going around spouting off unasked-for parenting advice.\" Especially when it comes to something like reusable vs disposable diapers, because it's something people can get SO judgy about even though there are many reasons why one or the other might not be practical for someone's family situation. \n\nBut reading the full thing did change my mind. At *minimum* this is an e-s-h because the whole \"I just want someone else to buy it for me\" is COMPLETELY ridiculous, my eyes practically rolled out of my head. \n\nStill overall I'm leaning toward NTA here because when a friend starts saying \"man diapers are so expensive,\" then it seems reasonable to respond with a suggestion/advice like \"oh if money is the issue, maybe reusable ones might be an option\" -- which is basically what your and Sally's initial interaction was.", "I think it\u2019s a good suggestion, and I also know that some daycares don\u2019t take them and you spend a lot in water and electricity cleaning them. We found that getting diapers at costco was about the same in cost between our two kids and that felt so wrong in so many ways. \n\nDiapers are just super expensive and twins are so hard to cover for cost wise. Also with nee young ones, she probably is sleep deprived and not going to take unsolicited advice well. I also think it wasn\u2019t super nice doing that in a group chat but honestly, I can\u2019t blame you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH and I think apologizing and moving on is the best way. You already said sorry. I think you are fine. Hopefully she isn\u2019t so taken back that she gets petty and dissolves the relationship. I also can say, even if someone is making a lot, they may have expenses that you don\u2019t know about. Twins can frequently come early and with that come with medical issues that get expensive. I hope your kids and family are doing well.", "I want other people to buy all sorts of stuff for me!! But nooOOOoo, they don't.\n\nNTA OP.", "Yeah but even then, they were the ones who chose to have a baby. It's entitled of them to expect other people to buy their diapers.", "Not if you don\u2019t have a washing machine and line dry things. Line drying alone is another method to save on electric use for people needing to cut costs.", "I know! It's SO frustrating! I mean, my car is getting older, and starting to develop a bit of rust, so I'd really like a new one. And it would be great if someone else would pay for an electrician to come and do a little work around my house. And one of my dogs needs expensive prescription food, as well as an expensive prescription pill for skin allergies \u2013 and come to think of it, the heartworm/flea/tick preventative pills for all three dogs ain't exactly cheap. But do my friends offer to buy me a new car? Or pay for the electrician? Or cover the expenses for the dogs I freely chose to adopt? No, they do not! What jerks, right?", "I know right.   I want some clothes that aren't \ud83c\udfaf and that trip to somewhere.   Why are my selfish  friends \n paying their bills and mortgage and trying to buy petrol and food ?", "That is very labor intensive. If these people work jobs and already have kids, I assume Sally is older and may not have the back for it. I could be wrong, but it is a lot easier to say to do this then to actually do it. And if the daycare doesn\u2019t accept them it\u2019s moot. I cannot imagine washing the amount of diapers one kid makes by hand let alone two.", "Ugh the world is just so expensive and cruel! E S H... except us.", "Yeah I tried the cloth diapers. Total disaster. I spent a bunch of money on them, did all the things the internet people said. He almost always peed through them in 30 minutes, meaning a change of clothes, bath, etc. I was so disappointed. What I should have done was at least buy the disposable inserts. And washing them correctly was a TON of work."]}
